Speaker 1: What was your mother's name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Margie Warner and she was born in Indianapolis, Indiana.
Speaker 1: And did she tell you any stories, perhaps, about growing up?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Would you share a little with us?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  My--both my grandparents, my maternal grandparents, were from the South so I had the benefit of the--the stories of the South without having to live as far South as they did.  My grandmother [Delia May Terry] was from Nashville [Tennessee], my grandfather [Willy Lee Terry] was from Montgomery, Alabama and my mother would always tell us stories about, you know, making ends meet.  You know, we live in an age where if you want chicken, you go to the store and buy it.  My mother grew up during a time when she went out in the yard and picked it up and wrung its neck and plucked it and cooked it so we were raised to be very self-sufficient.  Indianapolis, Indiana is pretty much a Southern town.  The Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] lived twenty minutes from my house so I always grew up with a sort of "I'm not taking that from you" attitude and I think I got that from my mother.
Speaker 1: And how did the presence of the Ku Klux Klan resonate through your--through Indianapolis, generally?  Did people talk about it?  What was that--
Speaker 2: No, there just the sense of a line that you didn't cross that, you know, it was okay for you to be here but not okay for you to be there and it was okay for you to want this but not okay for you to want that, and that's why I think education was not as prevalent as it should have been but success was always the key and it was clear that I wasn't going to reach any--attain any kind of success staying in Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: Umm.  And you said that you had a, you know, I'm not going to take this kind of an attitude--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --that you got from your mother.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Where do you think she gleaned that attitude from or that confidence?
Speaker 2: I think because, you know, growing up, my mother had six siblings.  My--her oldest brother--she's the oldest girl.  My--her oldest brother was a doctor and everything was focused on sending him to college and not for her to go to school but she made her own way, went to Washington, D.C., went to business school, got a job working for the government, so I mean, she just has this very quiet will about what she wants and who she is.
Story_ID: 130306
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, very.
Speaker 1: And how did--what were their names and how did you interact with them?
Speaker 2: Well my maternal grandparents were Delia May and Willy Lee Terry.  They were amazing.  I mean my grandmother was a real pillar of the church, you know, and my grandfather was one of the Pullman Porters who traveled across the country and when my grandmother started having children, she said, "eh, eh."  So he started working for a bakery in Indianapolis [Indiana] and rose very quickly to a management position and, which was rare in those days, but they were both really gregarious people, you know.  My paternal grandparents were very much country folk, you know, from Kentucky.  My dad [Leander Warner] was born and raised in Maysville, Kentucky, Washington County, Kentucky and they had twelve kids.  Twelve kids, and very close family, but very, sort of down-home folks, you know, so that was the, I think, the Yin and the Yang of my parents' relationship.
Speaker 1: What were your grandparents, your paternal grandparents, names?  And what kinds of things did they do in Kentucky?
Speaker 2: My paternal grandparents were George Washington Warner and Mary Warner, Mary Halls Warner.  They were both farmers and lived off the land and, you know, sold their produce and, you know.  In fact, Maysville, Kentucky is across the river from Aberdeen, Ohio and, in one way or another, I'm related to almost everybody in Maysville, Kentucky because that--you grew up there, you were expected to stay there and raise your family, and Indianapolis is very much that way too.  But Rosemary Clooney was from Maysville and whenever we would see each other on the road, 'cause she and Lily Tomlin were very good friends and she'd say, "Hey, Kentucky."  It was very much that way, you know.  It was, my--
Speaker 1: Very local?
Speaker 2: Very local, very humble, very--
Speaker 1: Now when you were a kid, did you visit either set of grandparents in, where they were from?  So did you go to Alabama, did you say?
Speaker 2: No, they were, by then--
Speaker 1: You said Montgomery.
Speaker 2: --they were in Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: Oh, so your maternal grandparents were there in Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: In Indianapolis.
Speaker 1: And then, did you visit Kentucky?
Speaker 2: All--every summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every summer I was on the farm.  So I was really a country girl.
Speaker 1: So how would you--you said your paternal grandparents were down-home people.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: But if you had to describe them to someone, how would you describe your grandmother, for instance?
Speaker 2: Oh, very conscientious, very religious, very--was all about her family and her children and she raised twelve very sophisticated children who went out into the world, made their way, raised wonderful families and we're all still very close.  We have a family reunion every other year.  On my granddad's birthday, which was July 4, and so just the--collecting the memories from that, the photos and the video--home videos, I mean, it really grounded me for living in a place like New York [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: And how about your grandfather?  How would you describe him?
Speaker 2: I would describe him as a real pistol.  My grandfather would tell us stories about the chain gangs and the slave, you know, camps, you know, 'cause, I mean, he was born in 1895 so a lot of what was wrong with this country, he experienced firsthand.
Speaker 1: So were the chain gangs local for him?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Did he know anyone who was on the chain gang?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes he did.  The war--you know, I mean, it was--it's not just in the twenty-first or twentieth century that we experienced going to jail.  I mean, that was how they basically provided labor for various states and cities.  So, yeah he--
Speaker 1: Not unusual.
Speaker 2: Not unusual.  He barely escaped it himself.
Story_ID: 130307
Speaker 1: Fantastic. So let's talk a little bit more about your grandparents.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I've asked you to describe your paternal grandparents--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --if you might do the same for your maternal grandparents.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: If you had to describe them to someone, what would you say?
Speaker 2: I would say that my grandmother [Delia May Terry] is very--was very--she was a visionary.  She had a sense of who her kids were and how she wanted them to function in the world and so she gave them that and she was very stylish.  I loved the way she dressed and her attention to detail and she was very community oriented.  You know, if you--if kids didn't behave in her community, she would let them know and then let their parents know, you know, and I think we need to bring that back into our communities.  My grandfather [Willy Lee Terry] was very gregarious but shy at heart, you know.  So he was just a homebody.  Once he was home, that was it, back porch and--
Speaker 1: After he finished at the bakery?
Speaker 2: Yes, after the bakery and people knew him in the community as well.  So they were very active in their church and very active in terms of--they were the pillar of our family, you know.  My grandfather would do that pig in the ground thing, you know, and just call everybody and say, "Okay, it's on, come over," you know.
Speaker 1: You said that your grandmother was a visionary--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and had a vision for her children?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You also mentioned that for the oldest son--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --they had a lot of academic plans?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how do you--what do you think your grandmother's vision was for your mother [Margie Warner]?  And how did she provide that for your mother?
Speaker 2: I think that without--I think that she was afraid for my mother.  I think that, you know, women in those days just didn't think that it was necessary for women to have education, that they were just going to raise families.  But I think my mother actually shared something with my grandmother in terms of helping her realize that the world was changing, you know, and that she was okay with that.  It was going to be okay.  So my mother went off to Washington [D.C.].  She was the only one who left.  No one else left Indianapolis [Indiana].  My grand--I mean my uncle, rather, went to Meharry Medical School [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] so he left to go to school.  And then he went to Wisconsin to practice medicine but my mom came back to Indianapolis, met my dad [Leander Warner], got married and did raise a family.  But at least she had her education and had her experiences.
Speaker 1: How did she meet your father?
Speaker 2: That's a good question.  I think they met at a jazz club, you know.  Indianapolis was always a hotbed of jazz.  I mean, the--the, oh gosh, now I can't think of his name.  The great guitarist, Wes Montgomery, lived a block away from us, the whole family [Montgomery Brothers], Buddy Montgomery, but my mom and dad were always jazz enthusiasts and I think they met through friends.
Speaker 1: If you had to describe your mother--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --to someone, how would you describe her?
Speaker 2: Oh, she's feisty.  My mother is really bright, feisty, she just retired.  My mom's eighty-one.  She just retired two years ago and so--
Speaker 1: And what was she doing prior to retirement?
Speaker 2: She worked for the State of Indiana in the, what they call the Public Employee Retirement Fund.  And so she was an account manager and people still call there looking for her because they trust her.  And she explains things in very clear terms, you know, and she's a very honest person.
Speaker 1: It makes you understand your money.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  And she too is very stylish.  My mother is really--puts it together and did the same thing with--for her kids.  I mean my mother was always about, you know, you should follow your dream.  You have to have a dream first but then you should follow it.
Speaker 1: And did she have an interest in your education and feel that that was something natural for you to do because you were a female person and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --she had done that for herself?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely, but I--but education in the formal sense, I mean, I've always been a person of the world so for me it was like, I just needed to get out and do things rather than--rather than just go to school.  So I started--I went to Bloomington [Indiana University Bloomington].  I didn't like the experience so I moved to New York [New York City, New York].  I'd never been to New York, didn't know anyone in New York.  I had an uncle who lived out in Hempstead [New York].  I just called him and said, can I come stay with you?  And then I got a job at CBS and an apartment the same day and I've been here ever since.
Story_ID: 130308
Speaker 1: Wow, and how about your father [Leander Warner]?  If you needed to describe your father to someone, what would your words--what would you choose?
Speaker 2: I would say that my father is a man of the world.  He had a lot of friends.  Everybody loved my dad.  I would say that he was a very--he was a taskmaster, you know, that was his thing.  But, you know, he's also a very--because he came from a large family, it was a huge family person, and he was the oldest boy, so he was like the big--everybody's big brother, you know.
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up in Indianapolis [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: Well that's an interesting question.  My earliest memory is being in the backyard of my grandparents' home.  My grandfather [Willy Lee Terry] built the house that they lived in and it was just always a center of comfort and family and both families were very close.  So the family from Cincinnati [Ohio], Kentucky, would come up and hang out with us and there was always a lot of people around.  So I remember being the center of attention because I was the first grandchild so, and just--always looking up and seeing lots of faces and feeling lots of love.
Speaker 1: So how many siblings do you have and what are their names?
Speaker 2: I have four siblings, one deceased, unfortunately, recently.  My--the brother next to me is Paul and he lives there in Queens [New York] and we're all two years apart.  My mother [Margie Warner] was really good about that.  She sort of paced herself.  Then there was--then there is Karen who lives in Queens.  My sister--my sister Joyce, passed away in Indianapolis and then my brother, Steve, is here in New York as well.  They--I moved to New York and they all followed me, you know.
Speaker 1: You've gotta have a way made--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --once the road is open.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: So, how did you celebrate at your house?  It sounds like there were a lot of people--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --tend to be around.  What were--
Speaker 2: Food.
Speaker 1: --celebrations like and what did you celebrate?
Speaker 2: Food.  We didn't have--
Speaker 1: We want to hear about the food.
Speaker 2: The food, the food.  My mother is the most amazing, amazing cook.  She still is and just--and because she cooks for a lot of people, she just--there's always a lot of food and traditional food.  She makes an amazing chicken and dumplings and greens and my father was a hunter so he would go out and bring--and my father and my grandfather would hunt together and bring home all these things, you know, and rabbit and, you know, all that sort of thing and my mother would just cook it up.  And then in the summer they fished and the winter they hunted.
Speaker 1: Well, which grandparent was it--which--it was your mother you said would go out and get the chicken?
Speaker 2: Yeah my mother and--
Speaker 1: So she clearly had some experience with--
Speaker 2: Exactly, with all of that.  She was really good at that.  And my father and my mother's father were very close and they would go hunt together and just--there would be a feast.  And we didn't need anything to celebrate.  I mean, you know, we had the traditional holidays.  Buy my mother liked to read to us and so we'd have a lovely meal and then she'd--I remember when she read the--she clipped 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' out of a magazine and I think we were all, this was in the '50s [1950s], you know, when it first came out and she would just read to us and we always had encyclopedias and, you know, we had a subscription to National Geographic and, you know, so we got that kind of education.
Story_ID: 130309
Speaker 1: And what about television and radio?  What kinds of information was coming into your home?
Speaker 2: We didn't spend a lot of time watching television.  I mean, it would be like a Saturday morning thing and that would be it.  And they would do the news at night.  We listened to a lot of jazz but that's 'cause my dad [Leander Warner] had a huge jazz collection.
Speaker 1: And who were your parents' favorites?
Speaker 2: Ella [Fitzgerald], you know, James Moody, Billy Eckstine, just all the greats.  I mean, there--we knew them all from infancy, you know, just heard it, heard the music.
Speaker 1: When you were a kid, where did you live?  Did you basic--did your parents still--is your mom [Margie Warner] still living in the same place where you were raised?
Speaker 2: No, she doesn't because she got an apartment, you know, and when she was working--
Speaker 1: Any more.
Speaker 2: Yeah, not any more but the house is still there and--
Speaker 1: So tell us a little bit about your childhood home and--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was great, I mean.
Speaker 1: --what was it like?
Speaker 2: I--I didn't realize, you know, it was--we grew up in a house which, you know, living in New York [New York City, New York] now I understand that--I had no idea--when I moved to New York, I bought three rooms of furniture because it never occurred to me that people didn't live in houses, you know, that they live in apartments.  It was very different.  So it was always about a house, an upstairs and downstairs and a backyard and a front yard and just--we took that for granted.  And I--and the community, you know, that I lived in, everyone had kids.  We all grew up together.  We all walked to school together and had the benefit of wonderful teachers.  I'm telling you, I'm so glad to have grown up when I did because I think in a sense the education system has lost that, being a motivating--
Speaker 1: Focus.
Speaker 2: --force in the community.
Speaker 1: So, your community sounds like it was kind of insular.  There were some sidewalks--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, oh yes.
Speaker 1: --people could go from house to house.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And then, in your house like, how many bedrooms did you have?
Speaker 2: It was a--it was a huge house.
Speaker 1: What was the main room?
Speaker 2: I don't know how they did that but they had a huge--we had a huge house and we had like five bedrooms.
Speaker 1: So did everybody have their own room?  Maybe two of you doubled?
Speaker 2: Yeah, for the most part, two of us doubled and then we had a guest room because there was always somebody coming to stay with us, so--and my parents and the baby, you know.  There was always a baby in the house.  So, and as the eldest, you know, that was--that was my focus.  It's like, what's the baby doing, you know?
Speaker 1: So, did you have chores?  Was that--was taking care of the smallest children your--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --household responsibility?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it was something I wanted to do.  It was--it was--I never played with dolls.  I never had that.  I never needed to because there was always the family to deal with.  And then it brought us into proximity with our cousins in that way and, you know, that we were always together and grew up together and grew up sharing things together.  And I'm really proud to say that my cousins have gone on to do really great things and I think a lot of that was based in the security they had as kids.  Security helps you understand who you are and--and feel comfortable in venturing out 'cause you know the home is always there and you can always go back home.
Speaker 1: And did you feel like that from your entire community?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Like you mentioned that your grandmother would, you know, make sure that everyone was disciplined--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the whole area which I think makes a difference with security.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you feel that way?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and felt that it was important.  I mean, I knew enough to know that it was important and when I was--I was that first generation.  I was bused out of my neighborhood to a high school and I felt I lost out.  I mean, I was being sent to a place that didn't want me, that I didn't want to go and so I had great teachers, great support system in my community.  My mother went to Crispus Attucks High School.  It had--in fact the class of '44 [1944], that was her graduating class, they still get together and do things, you know, every six months, which is amazing to me.  So we had a sense of education but education as part of your entire life, not just a destination, you know.
Story_ID: 130310
Speaker 1: Did your family attend church?
Speaker 2: Yes, very much so.
Speaker 1: And did you participate?  Where did you go?  And what did you do?
Speaker 2: Scotts United Methodist Church [sic, Scott United Methodist Church] and my mother [Margie Warner] still goes to Scotts United Methodist Church in Indianapolis [Indiana] and was very instrumental in building the new facility and my grandmother [Delia May Terry] was very involved in the church there.  So it's as usual in the black community, it's where everything--it was the central gathering place outside of your home.
Speaker 1: So what kind of activities did you participate in at church?
Speaker 2: Choir, you know, the youth ministry, all of that and enjoyed it and realized that when I left, that was the end of an era for me because I wasn't able to give it that time here in New York.
Speaker 1: When you're at home and you got into trouble--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --who was the disciplinarian in your home?
Speaker 2: My father [Leander Warner], definitely, and that was my mother, "I'm going to tell your father."  I said, "I'm sure you will, mom," I mean (laughter).  And so I think in many ways I learned how to be a disciplinarian by getting into trouble with my father.
Speaker 1: And what kind of punishment or responsibility did he mete out when you had done something?
Speaker 2: Had to wash that car, you know.  It was always a chore attached to it, you know.  And so--but that taught me a lesson.  If you didn't want to have to do that chore, then don't get into trouble.  And it was a really--I thought it was a very effective way of teaching a lesson, you know.
Speaker 1: So, I'll ask you first, what did you like least about growing up in Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: Indianapolis (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what was the problem with Indianapolis?
Speaker 2: I just felt it was very limiting and in many ways Indianapolis had this sort of social strata.  I think every city does and if you were from that side of the tracks, you know, people didn't expect you to do things.  And so I sort of grew up with this, you know, you can't do that, you know, that's not for you.  And so that just made me more determined to follow my own path and to--and I realized at a very young age that I had to create a path.  I mean, you had to--you had to figure out what you wanted to be because otherwise you were going to be what somebody else told you to be.  And we had enough of that in the black community.
Speaker 1: And what did you like most about?
Speaker 2: Indianapolis was--Indianapolis, because it had this--this large, very diverse sort of economic base really, 'cause, you know, there was a military base there and so I liked the fact that there were people with a lot of money in Indianapolis that I got to know.  I liked--it sort of whetted my appetite.  There was a woman that I used to babysit for who was phenomenal.  I mean, she was Filipino and she was married to this big brother, you know, and they had the most beautiful kids and organizing her home and she liked the fact that I was very--I was a self-starter, that she didn't have to like tell me to do anything, you know.  And I enjoyed what she had.  And then I just decided I had to have that too, you know.  And that, coupled with what I grew up with, gave me a sense of, I think a really good sense of--of taste and what I wanted from the world.
Story_ID: 130311
Speaker 1: You've told us a little bit about your education--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --but I want to ask a little more specifically now, where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to P.S. 41 [Elementary School, Indianapolis, Indiana].  It was an amazing school because the teachers there weren't, when I think about it in hinds--hindsight, they weren't a lot older than I was, actually, you know.  They were--they were young, African American teachers who had just come out of school and--but the principal of my school, Mr. Weaver, his brother [Robert C. Weaver] was the president, or the chairman of the Housing and Urban Development Committee [sic, U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development], I think it was, in Washington [D.C.].  So, there was a sense of, "you will do well" and there was a sense of, they acknowledged my innate abilities, you know.  I mean, I didn't even know what they were at the time but they recognized things in me and they nurtured that.
Speaker 1: Now you said that you discovered early that you needed to choose a path?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did that happen as early as elementary school?
Speaker 2: Yes, definitely.
Speaker 1: So what did you think in elementary school that you were going to do with your life?
Speaker 2: I thought, not in specifics but just that, you know, when I was in the--I was skipped from the fifth grade to the seventh grade based on my--my academic, I guess--
Speaker 1: Prowess?
Speaker 2: --testing, you know, testing in school.  That made me--that put me in a whole other level of--I was a younger person involved with older kids.  I wasn't allowed to do what older kids did but I still had to keep up with them and so that gave me a sense of, "I need to keep on this track and figure out how I can best shine," you know, and--
Speaker 1: What about junior high?  Where did you go and--
Speaker 2: That's when I was bused--
Speaker 1: --what was it like?
Speaker 2: --to--
Speaker 1: So it's mid 1950s when you're getting bused or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it was late 1950s.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Shortridge [Public] High School [Indianapolis, Indiana] was--it was like a--sort of a preparatory time and then you went into high school.  And it was really tough because, you know, I thought of myself as being bright and I wanted to pursue an academic track and they were giving me general business, general math, home economics.  It's like, what is--what is--how's that going to better my life?  And they didn't even want to address that issue.  That wasn't important to them.  So--
Speaker 1: How did you attempt to address it with them?
Speaker 2: I went to my counselor and said, this is not what I want to do and so I was able to get some assistance that way and graduated from high school.  Didn't really understand, and I still don't think kids today, and the African American community understands scholarships and, you know, putting your best foot forward in that way.  I think we need to do more.
Speaker 1: Well when you were in high school, did you have a sense of what you wanted to do?  You've spoken a little bit about people telling you that you couldn't do what you wanted?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, in school, what were you saying?  What were you expressing?  And what were people telling you was not the place for you?
Speaker 2: You know, I think it was more a sense of where I wanted to--where I wanted to express myself, you know.  It's like I wasn't really--I wasn't really interested in just getting married and having kids but I didn't really know what the next step was.  So for me, the next step was to leave Indianapolis and that's--
Speaker 1: That's what you did?
Speaker 2: That's what I did.
Story_ID: 130312
Speaker 1: So when you were in high school [Shortridge Public High School, Indianapolis, Indiana], was your plan to go to school?  What did you think about going to college?
Speaker 2: Well, unfortunately, I didn't have enough of a plan, that was my problem.  I think I was so caught up in being concerned about getting out of Indianapolis [Indiana] and feeling trapped and not, you know, just growing up that I didn't fight hard enough to--to go to college and I just--I realized that I really wanted another path but I didn't know--I didn't have the tools at that time to get there.  So, I felt that the best path for me would be to leave Indianapolis and then reinvent myself and that's basically what I did.  I moved to New York [New York City, New York], got a job at CBS, got an apartment, went to Hunter College [New York City, New York] at night.
Speaker 1: Well, slow us down and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --how did you make that final decision to go to New York?  Did you share that with your parents [Leander and Margie Warner]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember very well.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: My mother standing in the doorway waving goodbye like she was never going to see me again.  I had a Ryder U-Haul [sic] (laughter).  You know, I had saved my little money and rented a--
Speaker 1: And you graduated?
Speaker 2: Yes, I graduated.
Speaker 1: And then did you take a job or anything, initially?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was working at Indiana University Medical Center [Indianapolis, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what were you doing there?
Speaker 2: I was working in a chemistry lab and I met some really interesting people and that's, you know, that was formative and that was, in terms of, organizing my thoughts about, you know, not just a job but what do I do after this?  You know, what do I really want to do?  I didn't know how to answer that and--
Speaker 1: And did--did you know people who were doing other things?  Like did you know people who were going to college or--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --people who were getting married?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: And taking it--going straight to the house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I did.  I was--I envied those--those people who were able to--their family expected them to go to college.  There was money set aside.  There was a plan for them to go to college.  I didn't quite have that but then it was--it was incumbent upon me to make that happen and I wasn't organized enough to do that.  So I think as I had more life experiences, moved to New York and then I started to see my way through it, it just--I got lost, you know, in growing up, you know, and I think now there's a better path for my family, the people in my family, my cousins--
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: --everybody.
Speaker 1: Well what you're also saying is that your--your sense that you were a bit lost wasn't the death knell of your--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --your life and career.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What it meant is that you had to sort of gain some skills and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and decide what you wanted to do.
Speaker 2: That's right.  There was another path.  It wasn't just about education.  I tried not to let that limit my--my vision, you know, and just--and that's how I ended up sort of in the industry that I'm in is just that, putting one foot in front of the other and saying, no, this is--this is where I'm going, this is what I would like to do and being in a sense the first to get there.
Story_ID: 130313
Speaker 1: Okay.  I still want to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --nitpick you a bit about this decision to move to New York [New York City, New York], which just seems like you were clear on but how did you announce that to your parents [Leander and Marie Warner]?  And what did they say before you're in the U-Haul?
Speaker 2: Right (laughter).
Speaker 1: And your mom is waving.  Like when you're actually having a discussion about it at home.
Speaker 2: Well they--they weren't happy.  They weren't happy about it.  It was like, you know, I was in a sense running away from something and they knew that and my father gave me a fifty dollar bill and said, well, you know, you'll always have money to come back home 'cause he just didn't think that was going to work.  And that wasn't really all that was said because I think he thought it was like, you know, an adventure.
Speaker 1: A couple of weeks.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: A month.
Speaker 2: Right, and then I'd be back but I--I was going to live with his brother and he thought that's fine, you're going from one relative to another.  I stayed with my uncle for two weeks, you know.  I got an apartment, I got a job and that was in 1970.
Speaker 1: Where was your first apartment?
Speaker 2: Four fifty-four [454] West 50th Street.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And it's still there.  In fact one of the things I'd like to do is a photo essay of all the places I've lived in New York because it's really--I've always been on the West Side in this neighborhood and--
Speaker 1: In so you're--just so to contextualize that you really were in sort of the Broadway area?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Even living?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us a little bit about showing up at CBS?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was interesting.
Speaker 1: Now don't skip over things too quickly.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, CBS had the largest ad in the paper that day, Sunday Times [New York Times].  I clipped it out, and I said, I'm going to go apply for a job there.  Got off the subway, this is really true, I got off the subway and as I came up, I didn't know where I was because I had not been in the city before.  So I asked this sister walking down the street, I said, can you tell me where--and I said the address.  And she said, "Oh, it's right there" you know.  Walk one block over.  Well I get to the office, fill out all this paperwork, you know for the interview, and then they--the--I was directed to take it to this young lady and it was the woman that I had asked directions of.  Her name is Cheryl Hozier [ph.], we're still friends.  She was working there at CBS.  We just started laughing.  To make a long story short, I got a job there.  I was working in Audience Development, is what it was called and, in fact, Marquita Pool [HM Marquita Pool-Eckert] was working there then and Estelle Popkin, we all sort of came in together and it was a really interesting time, that's all I can say, and that's when my life took off.  I had my apartment, I was going to Hunter College [New York City, New York] at night, I had a little radio show on WBAI, I mean it was like, you know.
Speaker 1: Was WBAI at 137th at that time?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was in, in the sixties, on the, like First Avenue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Over there.
Story_ID: 130314
Speaker 1: So how did you know that CBS was going to be the kind of place that you wanted to work?  Like what made you think you wanted to work in entertainment at all?
Speaker 2: Because that's--that's what I wanted.  And I didn't know that CBS would be the place I wanted to work actually but I saw it as a way in.
Speaker 1: And what did you do as an audience developer?
Speaker 2: I worked for Dr. William Clapper was his name, actually, and we used to do--it was 'All In The Family.'  We used to do sort of these surveys of audiences after they'd seen a show and just understand the response to the shows.  But more importantly, it put me in touch with people like Irene Gandy who was working at Columbia Records at that time and there was just a network of black folks that worked there that I got to know and it was a whole new community, you know.
Speaker 1: So when you arrived at CBS, there were a number of black people around?
Speaker 2: There were like five of us, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And do you think that the demographics there are similar today or did you feel like--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I think it's changed a lot.  It's changed a lot and it was--I mean I think it was more just that CBS was the kind of place that if you were interested in being a professional, they were interested in nurturing you and it was--it was really a terrific time to be there.
Speaker 1: So you're at CBS--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and what kind of hours are you working?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, I was working basically nine to five but then there were all these things that I was exposed to after work.
Speaker 1: That's my next question.
Speaker 2: That was the great--
Speaker 1: What else were you doing in the city or with CBS at night?
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't with CBS but it was because I was meeting people there--I mean I'm going to Hunter [College, New York City] and learning how to write and New York is the kind of place, and I think that's what--that's what freed me.  I was finally in a place where I could just be myself and not be sort of locked into where I came from in Indianapolis [Indiana].
Speaker 1: When did you start at Hunter?
Speaker 2: That was 1971.
Speaker 1: And were you a journalism major?
Speaker 2: Not a major.  I was basically just taking classes, you know, and not--not really pursuing a degree because I was working during the day and so--
Speaker 1: And so how did you decide--I mean, you expressed that you had some interest in going to college but how did you decide to go ahead and enroll at Hunter and pick a couple classes and start to take them?
Speaker 2: Because I felt it would--it would broaden my horizons and I just--I needed to put some structure to--to what I had to say and so both in expression, in terms of work, and lifestyle and the kind of people I wanted to be with, you know, and that's where they were.
Speaker 1: So, how did it go that two weeks when you were in--what was that, is Hempstead in Queens [New York]?
Speaker 2: Hempstead [New York] is Long Island.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how was that two weeks in Long Island?
Speaker 2: Oh, that was--it was torturous because, you know--
Speaker 1: You got out of there.
Speaker 2: I got out of there.  He really wanted me--it was like I moved from Indianapolis to Indianapolis and he wasn't interested in the city.  He called it like the "devil place," you know, and you know, and we laugh about that now but they lived a very sort of closeted life and I really didn't want that.  So I just sort of broke away and then I was so busy trying to better my life that it was--I was always about the next level professionally.  How could I get from--to the next point.
Speaker 1: Now, when you call home and say, I've got an apartment--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and I work at CBS and I'm about to enroll at Hunter, what did your daddy [Leander Warner] say?
Speaker 2: He said, "What."  It was a shock.  It was like okay, then you go ahead and do that, you know.  He said, I don't understand but you go ahead and do that.  So I think in his effort to protect us, you know, it was all about keeping us in a place that he understood.
Story_ID: 130315
Speaker 1: So you start at CBS doing the Audience Development?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And where do you go from there?
Speaker 2: From there, I started--I actually--
Speaker 1: Even within CBS, what do you do sort of over the time and then--then I'm assuming eventually you leave--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you start to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --manage--manage musical groups, it looks like.
Speaker 2: No, actually what I did was I left and went to Metromedia [Television].  I went to Africa.
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, Metromedia.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I met this guy who was producing a tour of the Jackson Five in Senegal and he said, you know, you've got great organizational skills, I would love to have you go with me.  Can you do that?  And so I said, okay.  I did that.  In fact, I had left CBS and was working for [HM] Earl Graves.  I was working for Black Enterprise magazine when I got that opportunity.  I went to Africa with the Jackson Five, came back and started working at Metromedia and went into production on two shows, 'Midday Live' and 'Wonderama.'
Speaker 1: Okay, you've hit me with the Earl Graves--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so I have to ask, what were you doing--
Speaker 2: At Black Enterprise?
Speaker 1: --at Black Enterprise?
Speaker 2: I was Earl's administrative assistant, so still trying to figure out what my skillset was and broaden that and worked.  It was a great opportunity working for Earl in the early days.  I mean, he was going gangbusters then and we were growing and--by leaps and bounds and when I had the opportunity to work for Metromedia, I said, okay, I'm going to take that skillset and then go work in broadcasting.
Speaker 1: Now what's Metromedia?
Speaker 2: Metromedia is now Fox.  It's Channel Five and it was the heyday when all those shows were being developed, you know.
Speaker 1: And, which shows?  I mean, they've got a long list of really popular shows?
Speaker 2: They have a really--yes--
Speaker 1: Like 'Dynasty' and 'Charlie's Angels' and--
Speaker 2: Right, that was being developed on the West Coast.  Basically what was happening on the East Coast was talk shows.  It was the form--the precursor really for like--
Speaker 1: 'Donahue' ['The Phil Donahue Show']?
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean it was all--'Donahue' wasn't there but it was 'Midday Live' was a ninety minute live show, every day, Monday through Friday.
Speaker 1: What's the--
Speaker 2: I was producing on--for that.
Speaker 1: And what's 'Midday Live' like?  Is it like today's 'View' or--
Speaker 2: No, it's like 'The Today Show.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you have a topic that's produced around, you know, you come up with a topic and then you create the story around the topic and then you bring in the guests and--
Speaker 1: And this is after--
Speaker 2: But it was--it was live like 'The Today Show.'
Story_ID: 130316
Speaker 1: And this is after you come back from South Africa?
Speaker 2: From Senegal.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, from Senegal--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --doing the Jackson Five tour?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Can we get a couple of anecdotes from Senegal--Jackson Five?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, that was an amazing time because being from Indianapolis [Indiana] and Michael [Jackson] and the family from Gary, Indiana, they felt--we were instantly comfortable with one another.  They were so young.  We were so young.  The first time in Africa, there was this culture shock.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you're in your early twenties and you're very baby twenties?
Speaker 2: That's right, right.
Speaker 1: And these guys are--
Speaker 2: In their teens.
Speaker 1: Thirteen through--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --Seventeen, maybe.
Speaker 2: Eighteen.  Right, right.  So it was--and it was--we all experienced that culture shock of being in Africa for the first time and what that meant.
Speaker 1: And what was the difference?  What was the rhythm--rhythmic difference or just the atmospheric change?
Speaker 2: Well the difference was that we were, you know, Senegalese were coming up to us and saying, "Oh, my sister, poor thing" and then, you know, we had this attitude, they're living in huts and they feel sorry for us.  You know, it's like we weren't getting it that we were perceived as being slaves and being, you know, so we had to think about that and, you know, we went to Goree Island [Dakar, Senegal] and understood the magnitude of, you know, how we came to this country, you know, and what that meant and how we were perceived and it was really amazing and especially as young as we were.
Speaker 1: And how did the audiences, it goes without saying--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --but how did the audiences respond?
Speaker 2: "Les Jackson Cinq."  You know, they just loved them.  It was an amazing time.  I don't even think the guys understood the cultural phenomenon that they were.  I don't think they understood that but I'm still very good friends with the people who were on that tour.  My friend Linda Tarrant, Logan and Jerry Westbrooks, we're still good friends.  I mean, and Marian Etoile Watson, we were all working on that tour.  So even though the Jackson family, you know, has gone its way, we still have our own little group.
Story_ID: 130317
Speaker 1: So you start associate producing for Metromedia--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, yes.
Speaker 1: And you're telling--you had just started to tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, tell us again which shows you were doing and what that was like?
Speaker 2: Well 'Midday Live' was--because it was a new format, this live format where you could just talk about anything that was of interest to you, so that's what I did.  I started booking things that were of interest to me.
Speaker 1: And what was the new morning news show like prior to 'Midday Live,' which sounds like it was really broken into a new mold?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was just a straight, you know, news delivery format but this was, you know, this was an expansion of--of the--exploring the culture, you know.  So my first--
Speaker 1: So what kind of things were you interested in?
Speaker 2: Well my first booking was [HM] Jessie [L.] Jackson and the Rainbow Coalition and this sister who had written a book about him, sort of, the lambasting, you know, what he stood for and just that whole dynamic of let's get to the truth of this and so there was a lot of that.  There was a lot of women in interesting fields because that was something that hadn't been explored really.  There was a lot of, "let's talk to Desi Arnaz" and there was a lot of whatever happened to, you know.  There was a lot of like, [HM] Geoffrey Holder, and 'The Wiz' and all of that because that was new and that's when I started to fall in love with Broadway, actually, was by being exposed to it on 'Midday Live.'
Speaker 1: And what was your audienceship like?  How was 'Midday Live' perceived by New Yorkers?  People loved it?
Speaker 2: Oh, because of the time, it was on from 9:30 to 11:00 so it was like mostly women who were at home with their kids but I think it grew just based on the kind of people that we were able to--to bring to the table.  We had a lot of sports, you know, Clyde Frazier, you know, Roberta Peters, the opera singers.  We just--anybody that was of interest that we thought the public wanted to know, we were lucky enough to have them come, participate with us.
Speaker 1: And how long did you work with 'Midday Live' or how long did you produce shows at Metromedia?
Speaker 2: It was about three years and then I--one of my segments that I produced was about women in unusual occupations and I had Liz McCann and Nelle Nugent on the segment and they were working for the Nederlander Organization at the time and I just thought they were fascinating about Broadway, what it meant, and I had been seeing a lot of Broadway at that time and so--
Story_ID: 130318
Speaker 1: What shows were you going to and what was the atmosphere in Broadway like then?  Did lots of people go?  Was it similar to TV where people were really excited about going to see shows?
Speaker 2: I think so but I felt that there were two--there was a sort of a dichotomy in the--the audiences.  There was black theatre and there was Broadway.  I didn't understand that but I walked right out of television into Broadway so it was a very different time but, you know, you had 'Raisin In The Sun,' you had--there were a lot of shows that had set the precedent, you know.
Speaker 1: And were those shows that were on Broadway?
Speaker 2: On Broadway, uh-hum.
Speaker 1: The black shows?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And then--
Speaker 2: 'The Wiz,' you had, you know, there was--there was a lot of, at that time, there was a lot happening.
Speaker 1: And then what, on Broadway, what kinds of shows were popular?  Probably the same?
Speaker 2: The same.
Speaker 1: But--
Speaker 2: Because they would be moved the same way they are today.  They would start Off-Broadway and then be moved to Broadway.  You know, 'Serafina,' you know, there was--there were just a whole host of expressions at the time.
Speaker 1: So what was your first job in Broadway?
Speaker 2: My first job on Broadway was 'Barnum,' I think was my--and otherwise we were doing--I was working in an office that did a spate of shows and so we had a--Pilobolus dance company, a dance theatre.  We had 'Barnum' which was a musical.  We were managing them at the time.  But the first one that we produced was 'Dracula' with Frank Langella and that was very exciting because it was a very groundbreaking time and then we did a lot of plays, mostly plays.
Speaker 1: And where were your shows?
Speaker 2: On Broadway.
Speaker 1: In various places?
Speaker 2: They were on Broadway.
Speaker 1: Various theatres?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: And did you also do a tour of 'Porgy and Bess'?
Speaker 2: Yes, that came at the end of my apprenticeship.  You have to do a three-year apprenticeship which was very much like going to law school.  We called it the "bar" because you had to do three years of an apprenticeship, then you had to take a--a six-hour written test and then a three-hour oral because as a manager, the only person who can go to jail who has a position of responsibility in terms of money, is the manager, and that's what I was pursuing.
Speaker 1: So this is all Broadway managers?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Now and then?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, it's a union position.  Everything on Broadway is a union position but that's what it takes to get into the union.
Speaker 1: I see.  So, how long did you take--make that an initial stint on Broadway where you were--you're working with McCann and Nugent Productions?
Speaker 2: McCann and Nugent.  I did, yes, and I did my apprenticeship, that was three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I--I was admitted into the union.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I just never stopped.
Story_ID: 130319
Speaker 1: So, the next thing that I know about is Lena Horne.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: How did that materialize?
Speaker 2: Okay, that materialized because I was doing a play called 'Mass Appeal' for Liz McCann [Elizabeth McCann] and Nelle Nugent.  We were in Boston [Massachusetts].  Eric Roberts left the show.  We came into New York, it was very dramatic.  Came into New York [New York City, New York] with Michael O'Keefe but the show just didn't capture the audience and so we closed.  And Lena's show had opened and there was a change in management and I was lucky enough to get that job.  So that six-week production was supposed to last for six weeks, it ran for three years and closed in London [England].  It was a wonderful experience.
Speaker 1: And in New York, what theatre was it in?
Speaker 2: It was at the Nederlander Theatre, which is the old Billy Rose Theatre on 41st Street [New York City], which is where 'Rent' is now.
Speaker 1: And then you said it closed in London.  So what other cities did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, we toured.
Speaker 1: --tour?
Speaker 2: We went--we closed on Broadway on her sixty-fifth birthday and then we just toured.  We went from New York to Massachusetts, then we went to Chicago [Illinois], Denver [Colorado], I mean we did a whole tour for a year and then at the end of the tour, we went to London.
Speaker 1: So, I perceived 'The Lady and Her Music' to be Lena Horne's definitive show.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Why was that?  I mean, can you describe for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, I mean it was her--Lena was a stalwart civil rights activist.  I mean, I don't know if people really understand how strongly she felt about her contribution to history and she experienced it and so this show was her opportunity to revisit that and every city that we performed and when we were in Chicago, she was talking about, you know, she would add things to the show.  And she was talking about how she was denied service in a restaurant.  She was out with the Korshaks who owned, you know, major department store [Stanley Korshak]--
Speaker 1: Everything in Chicago.
Speaker 2: --in Chicago, right, and she was denied service at a restaurant in Chicago.  And so she sort of relived all of that and made people understand that we can't take that for granted and she is so right that we can't take that for granted, as we know now.
Speaker 1: And what other kinds of things was she experiencing?  I mean, some of them are probably common knowledge but just to have you say--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --you said she's denied service.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: What other kind of treatment is she experiencing prior to this show while she's on the road and being Lena Horne?
Speaker 2: Yeah, being Lena Horne.  I mean, you know, it was amazing to me that every opening night, she would be pins and needles and scared to death and she said, what if they don't like me?  I said, why do you care, you're Lena Horne, you know.  But she's so invested in her audience and her community and when we were at the Nederlander, I remember [President] Ronald Reagan calling and Nancy Reagan called and asked if she would come perform at the White House, and she said, no.  She said, I have a show, I have a commitment to my community and maybe you haven't been in office to understand long enough, you haven't done enough for my people but, you know, maybe we'll talk about that later, you know.  I was so impressed by that and, you know, she talked about the fact that Ava Gardner, you know that, you know 'Show Boat' was--she was supposed to do 'Show Boat' and they--Max Factor created this makeup for her to darken her skin 'cause she was so fair.  And then in the end, they gave the role to Ava Gardner and that was really hurtful to her but when we closed in London, Ava Gardner came to see her in the show and just being there and seeing all the people that came to pay homage to her, I mean, Billy Eckstine and Carmen McRae came backstage and--
Speaker 1: You said Michael Jackson came.
Speaker 2: Michael came to see the show five times.  I mean, he was just blown away and it was an amazing exchange of energy, you know.  Her story resonated with people so much.
Story_ID: 130320
Speaker 1: So when you--so you tour with Lena Horne-
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --and then the next thing that I know about is working with the 'Sophisticated Ladies' which is a revue--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --of Duke Ellington music.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So can you tell us a little bit--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --about what that is and how it went?
Speaker 2: That was very exciting.  I was actually still touring with Lena and when I got the call about 'Sophisticated Ladies' going to Japan, it was going to be presented as the twentieth anniversary of TV Asahi which is like the PBS in Japan.  So they asked me if I would take that to Japan.  So I asked Ms. Horne if I could, you know, find a replacement, do that and then come back.  And she said, absolutely, because it's, you know, it's Duke, it's Mercer [Ellington], it's the whole family.  So I--I did that, went to Japan and then we created a tour of the United States.  [HM] Dee Dee Bridgewater was our star, actually.  It was a wonderful experience.  And then we went to Paris [France] and Dee Dee became the second Josephine Baker.  I mean she stayed and didn't come back.  Then I went back and finished the Lena Horne tour and that's when we closed in London [England].  So that was a great experience.
Speaker 1: That's nice and well-rounded?
Speaker 2: It was.  It was great.
Speaker 1: And as a result of your work starting at CBS, it sounds like you've traveled the world?
Speaker 2: I have, and that was--and I have to say that was one of the--one of my goals was to have a job that would give me what I wanted and I did want to travel.
Speaker 1: And what else?  So you said, give you what you wanted.  You wanted to travel.  You wanted--what did you--what were your ideas about what you wanted?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a part of this industry and that's why the--the culmination of the touring of the commercial side has led to my being involved in the nonprofit side where I think that the development of audiences, again, is really crucial.  I mean, I feel I've come full circle in a way.  Because if we don't create the next generation of audiences, who will we be producing for?
Speaker 1: So do you think that audience development is even more critical perhaps than when you began?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, I certainly do because there was a generation--we've lost a generation.  People experienced the arts in New York [New York City, New York] because that was their birthright, so to speak, but I don't--I think we missed a generation of people who really participated in that so it's up to us to bring them back.
Speaker 1: And do you think that generation shift happened because of television and--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --film access to film and--
Speaker 2: I do.
Speaker 1: --the development of that as a pastime?
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, I do, and I think also just the cost of theatre has gone up so much that it's--it's not as inclusive as it used to be.
Speaker 1: So what, you know, dollar figures may not do it but, you know, what was the cost of going to a Broadway show when you've arrived in New York versus now?
Speaker 2: That's--that's very telling.  I remember paying full price.  I think it was $17.50, full price.
Speaker 1: And what was that seventeen fifty like in relationship to how much money you earned?  Was that--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --a doable?
Speaker 2: Oh, it was very--
Speaker 1: Was that a doable amount?
Speaker 2: --it was very doable and I think in--and that's a very good point because the correlation between what earnings are today is why the costs keep going up, you know, and it's--and also the cost of producing itself has gone up so much, you know, the--the salaries, the production values have changed a great deal.  So it's no longer just about the written word, it's really all about helicopters landing onstage and, you know, nannies flying through the air, so, there's been a little bit of a shift in presentation of the art.
Speaker 1: And so give us a dollar figure then on how much it costs to go to a show, full price today?
Speaker 2: Oh, the average ticket today is $100.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: The average ticket is $100 to--and a play is $80, so from $17.50 to $80 but I mean we're talking a time span of twenty, twenty-five years, thirty years and if you consider the cost--escalation and cost say for sports, you know, I mean it's really not out of line, unfortunately, it's just that it does cost more money.
Story_ID: 130321
Speaker 1: How did you meet Lily Tomlin?
Speaker 2: Well, that was--that was a great story.  I was--after the Lena Horne show closed, and after 'Sophisticated Ladies' was done, I actually took a tour of [HM] Vy Higginsen's show, 'Mama, I Want To Sing' out on the road.  So, we were out in Detroit [Michigan] and I got a phone call that Lily Tomlin was bringing her one-woman show to New York [New York City, New York] and she wanted to meet me and I thought, I wonder why, you know.  But I had sort of developed this reputation as someone who--who dealt with star personalities and one-person shows.  So, I flew in, met with her and it was a great interview and flew back and she's--I got a call the next day saying, you know, can you--when can you start?  So I, you know, told Vy I was going to go do this show and 'Mama' kept touring and I came back to New York and the process with Lily's show was that it was being developed.  Now when I walked into Lena Horne, it was already an entity, it was--the show was done, it was, you know, existed and it was already up and running.
Speaker 1: So in an instance like that, what's--what do you then need to do?
Speaker 2: What is my job?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My job is--it's like starting a small business every time you open a show.  So my job is to, you know, create--negotiate the contract with the theatre, create the timeline for when we start selling, work with the box office but in the Lily Tomlin case, because the show was being developed, it was, you know, Jane [Wagner] and Lily were actually in the creative process, so there was a lot involved in terms of technicians and special effects and negotiating all of that and understanding what that was going to be in terms of the cost of the show.  Because she was a one-woman show that she was producing and in a sense directing, I mean, it was--it was--it had to be a really tight unit and it takes--that's a twenty-four seven involvement when it's a one-woman show like that.  And so it's, it's based on personality so she has to feel comfortable with you.
Story_ID: 130322
Speaker 1: And, what assets do you have that make you strong in this area?  Like you said, you had created sort of a reputation--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --for being able to handle this kind of a show.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: What did you have to offer?
Speaker 2: I think I have very strong organizational skills.  I think that's what I bring to the table and I'm also very good with people.  I think that, you know, in the entertainment industry, you know, there's drama to begin with so you don't need to bring your own drama to the table.  You really need to understand what your goals are, what the steps are and what your end result needs to be, and it's not always clear, believe me, it's not always clear.
Speaker 1: And what do you do when there's high drama on the set or amongst members or--
Speaker 2: Problem solve.  You just have to problem solve.  I mean, it's--and there's always a logical conclusion, it's just getting both sides to--to meet and realize that.  We're in the middle of that right now, as a matter of fact (laughter).
Speaker 1: I was going to ask for a couple of examples.  You have some good, juicy examples of one?
Speaker 2: Well, we have one right now.  I mean, every time a union's contract expires, then there's a negotiation between management and the union.  And so you have to deal with balancing the cost of doing business and giving labor something that entices them to sign a contract for "X" number of years.  So, it's--it's that.  It's--and calmer heads have to prevail.  You have to say, you know, you cripple an industry, it costs so much money to produce a show these days that you have to look at what--what they--the various components are and understand their relationship to one another so that you can afford to do what, you know, to do a show.
Speaker 1: What kind of dollars are you talking about?
Speaker 2: Oh my gosh.
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously shows vary but just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they do vary but I will tell you, I can't imagine that any show has amounted any more for less than ten million dollars.  So in order to be able to recoup, you know, I mean even plays are--today costs three to five million dollars, it's insane.  Off-Broadway will cost you a million dollars to produce.  It's labor cost, it's--it's production values, it's talent.  When you mentioned 'A Raisin in the Sun,' that was a wonderful production but I will tell you, because of the names involved, that was a pretty high ticket.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum, so--
Speaker 1: And what about a show like 'Topdog/Underdog'?
Speaker 2: 'Topdog/Underdog'--
Speaker 1: It seemed to me like it was kind of simple.
Speaker 2: It seemed simple but, again, you know you've got the talent involved.
Speaker 1: The director [George C. Wolfe].
Speaker 2: You've got the director, you've got the production values, even though they look simple, you've got the cost of the theatre that you're operating in, you've got the cost of marketing the show to an audience that doesn't normally go to the theatre.  So those are all the factors that you have to consider and--
Speaker 1: Do most shows lose money?
Speaker 2: Most shows lose money.  Very few shows recoup and that's the sad truth.
Speaker 1: And the shows that recouped, do they tend to be the same shows?  I mean it seems like there's a lot of recycling of the shows, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's 'The Lion King,' it's--
Speaker 2: Right, well 'The Lion King' has--is not the typical business model because it's a Disney production and Disney is an entity that can absorb whatever losses it may have but it's never had any losses.  I think 'The Color Purple' is a good example because it--it was unusual fundraising that Oprah's [Oprah Winfrey's] input brought it, you know, to fruition but also the marketing piece of it and 'Color Purple' is making money.  It has recouped and that's a wonderful--especially for a black show, that's unheard of.
Story_ID: 130323
Speaker 1: And you said when we talked about these three shows, '[A] Raisin In The Sun,' 'Topdog/Underdog' and 'The Color Purple'--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: --that we're marketing to an audience that doesn't ordinarily go to the theatre.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Why don't black folks go to the theatre?
Speaker 2: I think a lot of--that's a question we really need to address but I think a lot of it is they don't feel included.  You know, they don't want to go to the theatre just to see a black show, and this is my point with producers all the time.  You have to make them feel included all the time.  Market to them all the time, not just for black shows.
Speaker 1: Ah, so you think black folks would be more likely to go if they felt like they could go all the time--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and make choices.
Speaker 1: --so that if they were going to see Lily Tomlin--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --and they were also going to see--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --perhaps a musical and--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --then when the black shows came about, then they would go to that also.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I mean black folks are like anybody else, they want to see good theatre.  They don't want to--they don't wanna go just to be going to the theatre.  They really want to have an experience that they relate to.  'Spring Awakening' is a show that I think people would enjoy but it's not on their radar screen and it's not marketed to them.  But [HM] Bill T. Jones was the choreographer on this show and it's a really fresh approach to theatre and I enjoyed it very much.  So I think that there needs to be more of a business model that says that we market to everyone, not just to specific constituencies.
Speaker 1: What kind of show was Lily Tomlin's one-woman show?
Speaker 2: It was--it was a--I describe it as a stream of consciousness, you know.  Lily was tapping into the culture of the day, women's issues, issues--
Speaker 1: And this is the mid-1980s?
Speaker 2: This is the mid-1980s, 1985.
Speaker 1: And what, if you had to describe, what was working with Lily Tomlin like?  You said she was one of the smartest people that you've ever met.
Speaker 2: She's very bright, very committed, very process-oriented, never stopped in her pursuit of perfection, which was just amazing to me because, you know, as a one-woman show creating all these characters and using sound effects and lighting effects and so she was very state-of-the-art in her approach to the--to the technical aspects of theatre at the time.
Speaker 1: So how long are you on the--that show?  It's the 'Search for Signs of Intelligence'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that ran for three years.
Speaker 1: The 'Search for Signs of Intelligence In The Universe' ['The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe']?
Speaker 2: 'Life'-'Life in the Universe.'  Yes, I did--I toured with Lena [Horne] for three years, 'Sophisticated [Ladies]' was a year in between there and then there were three years--there was three years after that.
Speaker 1: And then right behind you, we have the, what you call the posters from those events?
Speaker 2: Yes, these are the posters from all the shows.
Speaker 1: The Lena Horne on the left and the Lily Tomlin on the right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 130324
Speaker 1: What did you do after you finished touring?
Speaker 2: I actually moved to California.  I decided that I had done the touring thing.  I moved to Los Angeles [California] as the general manager of the Ahmanson [Theatre] and the Doolittle [Theatre, now Ricardo Montalban Theatre] Theatres at The Music Center.  Had a great time there and there's posters back there from that season.  We did 'Phantom of the Opera,' 'Les Liaisons Dangereuses.'  Had a great time in Los Angeles but theatre lives in New York [New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: I was about to say, what's the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --like I asked about Senegal, what's--how's the rhythm different in Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's very different.  It's very different.  It's--but there's a huge theatre-going community in Los Angeles, as well, and there's a lot of small theatres in Los Angeles that are doing groundbreaking work.  So--
Speaker 1: I've also always felt in California, generally, in L.A. in particular, that there's more--like physically you can get in to see more.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And the venue turns out to be some place you can actually see the person.
Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly, it's--
Speaker 1: You paid whatever--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --you paid, which wasn't ridiculous.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: You can't believe it.
Speaker 2: That's right because it's--it's--theatre has to compete more in Los Angeles with other popular culture, with film and television, which is produced there, so it's--and whereas in New York theatre, it reigns supreme in New York.  So I did a tour of--another tour of 'Porgy and Bess' for Houston Grand Opera which was sort of like my farewell tour, "inshallah" ["if God wills it"] as they say in Kenya, but it was a--it was a great tour.  We produced, co-produced, it with eleven different venues, opera companies and producers across the country.  I came--I got a phone call when I was in Houston [Texas] to come back to New York to do the 'Jackie Mason Show' and I decided to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, wait, before I let you come back to New York--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --from the Houston Opera--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --so you did some theatre in Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: But did you also do some slick production, like commercials and--
Speaker 2: I did.  We--I had a partner, we produced commercials.  We did the L.A. equivalent of the 'Black Llama' fur commercials for Evian.  I worked on a film. I did 'The Fisher King' with Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges, which was great.  I really wanted to just test the waters to see if I was--
Speaker 1: To see what it was like.
Speaker 2: --that was like.  I'm not really a film person.  I really am a theatre baby but it was a great experience.  I'm glad I did it and I learned a lot about that community too.  That's a tough community.  And theatre's a club but film is really a tougher club to break into.
Speaker 1: Meaner?
Speaker 2: More expensive.  A lot more expensive.
Story_ID: 130325
Speaker 1: We didn't talk about this initially but what was your background in theatre and production when you were living in Indianapolis [Indiana]?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: So there--you didn't participate--
Speaker 2: It was--
Speaker 1: -- in any shows?
Speaker 2: I did not.  It was--and even though Indianapolis is now the home of Circle Repertory Theatre [sic, Indiana Repertory Theatre] and all of that, that didn't exist when I lived there.  And when I lived in Indianapolis, there was no pro-ball teams, there was none of that.  So it was just a different day.  So theatre for me is a passion.  It's not about background for me, it's really about stepping up to the plate and just doing it and New York is the place where you can do that.
Speaker 1: So they call you in Houston [Texas], you're doing 'Phantom of the Opera' tour with the Houston [Grand] Opera.
Speaker 2: I was--I was doing 'Porgy and Bess.'
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: --'Porgy and Bess.'
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: So tell us how you come back to New York and what happens?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--I got this phone call and Jackie's doing another show and, as you know, Jackie Mason does these great one-man shows and so he's difficult so they called and said can you come back and do this show?  And I thought that was my calling to come back to New York.  It was--it was time for me to come back and so I did.
Speaker 1: Do all the one-person shows involve some difficulty with personality?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a little--yes, because they're very--most stars are very heavily invested in their productions and so it's not just a matter of managing the crew and the house, but it's all about the interchange with that person and making them feel cared for.
Speaker 1: So tell us about Jackie Mason.
Speaker 2: Oh, well it was--it was an interesting production in that he decided--he took a little bit of a departure and involved the Boys Choir of Harlem [New York] in one of the pieces so I got to produce that and it was called 'Love Thy Neighbors' so it was all about how we have to, you know, it was--his shows tend to be social messages and we had a lot of fun but it didn't last long and I found--I found out about this position at Theatre Development Fund.  And I decided that it was time for me to get involved in the nonprofit side of the business.
Speaker 1: You said that earlier, why?
Speaker 2: Because that's where the--that's where the mission and the charge for the future lies.  I mean, commercial theatre is all about getting an audience that day, someone to come in and be in that seat but I think that the nonprofit sector is--feels very strongly about creating audiences for the future and the only way we're going to be able to meld culture with--with art, I think, and have it be sustained is through audience development.
Speaker 1: So, do you come to the Theatre Development Fund right when it begins?
Speaker 2: No, Theatre Development Fund had--is a thirty-year-old organization and their most prominent program is the TKTS Booth in Times Square.
Speaker 1: Well tell us what the TKTS Booth is?  I think anyone who has come to New York has seen it--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and knows what it is--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but what's that mean?
Speaker 2: Well it's a program that was developed by Theatre Development Fund to make theatre affordable for audiences and it was also--it came about at a time of revitalization for Times Square in New York.  Mayor Lindsay, John Lindsay, decided that Times Square was actually a dangerous place in those days and trust me, as someone who is working here, that was true.  So, it was an idea that by bringing more people into Times Square that that would bring the--elevate the level of commitment to Times Square and it worked.
Speaker 1: To keep it from sort of being a boondock.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And so Theatre Development Fund has worked tirelessly to create this environment of--of inclusive--making theatre inclusive for everyone.
Speaker 1: Now one way that it does that is by providing tickets that are cost-effective.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: I've seen people lined up around the booth outside--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 130326
Speaker 1: What else does the [Theatre Development] Fund do in order to--
Speaker 2: Well in 1990 they started an educational program, an education arm, which has been just--it has grown by leaps and bounds but, you know, the mission is audience development and we feel that by engaging people at a younger age, they'll understand the culture of going to the theatre.
Speaker 1: So how do you get young people to the theatre?
Speaker 2: We go right into the [New York City, New York] schools, we work with the students--with the teachers, rather to identify students that are interested in coming to the theatre and then we--we have several programs.  We have one program where we just bring classes into the theatre but we go into the school first to teach them about what they're going to see.  We have teaching artists that go in, explain the show, it's--it's curriculum-based so we go in either through the English class or history class or, in some cases, the math class and we connect with the students in terms of what they're learning and then they see the show and then we go back and discuss it with them.
Speaker 1: So you said you--so do you choose shows based upon perhaps the subject matter of what the students are doing?  Can you give us an example, like, what a math class has gone to see and how like--
Speaker 2: Yeah, like 'Proof,' you know, when 'Proof' was--was running on Broadway, we based our model around the math class and what a proof is and--I mean, and kids never thought about it that way.  So, we try to do all Broadway plays and then find a hook in the classroom.
Speaker 1: So you said the--so that was two programs you said--
Speaker 2: And then, yes.
Speaker 1: --the class comes in--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but you go first?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Then what about the select group?
Speaker 2: Yes, this is--this was a dream of Wendy Wasserstein who felt that, again, the theatre--attending the theatre in New York is a birthright and that every child living in New York should have that opportunity.  So she created this program called "Open Doors."  We interact--we have mentors who will take ten students to see a production and then come back and discuss it and keep a journal.  And at the end of the school year, we actually have a graduation.
Speaker 1: Who keeps the journal?
Speaker 2: The student keeps their own journal and at the end of the--at the end of the school year, we'll have a graduation and it's really amazing to listen to these kids talk about what it has meant to them to understand the process and express themselves.
Speaker 1: So how many shows is a group of ten students seeing?
Speaker 2: They're--we try to--every show--every show possible because we buy the tickets.  None of our programs cost anything--at a cost to the student.  We pay for everything.  So it's based on what our budget can bear.
Speaker 1: So a student in one of these small groups is actually seeing like a season of theatre?
Speaker 2: Exactly right.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Exactly right.
Speaker 1: And what happens at the graduation?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's wonderful.  At the graduation, they speak about, you know, how they've learned to express themselves and in their writing and the relationship that they've forged with the mentors and we--I was explaining to you earlier, we have this case history now, which I would love for someone to write, the first--one of the first students in Wendy's first group came out of high school, went to Sarah Lawrence [College, Bronxville, New York], did her graduate work at NYU [New York University, New York City] and now she's written her first play.  That's what we want to see.  Now that's a committed theatre professional now.  That's what we want to see.
Speaker 1: And presumably that's someone who's going to take her group of ten--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --to the theatre--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --and it continues on.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: And what kind of students are these?  Are these students whose parents are going to the theatre already?  Or--
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean these are public school students, for the most part, they've never been to the theatre.  That was Wendy's--Wendy's dream was that it would expose kids who've not had an opportunity to be exposed to theatre, be exposed to theatre.
Story_ID: 130327
Speaker 1: What other kind of responsibilities do you have managing the Theatre Development Fund?
Speaker 2: Well as a Chief Operations Officer, I'm basically involved with the TKTS Booth operations.  We also have an eighty-five-thousand-piece costume collection.  It's a working costume collection that we rent costumes all across the country.  We produce--I produce award shows.  We have the Irene Sharaff Awards which is given to outstanding costume design every year.  We have the Fred Astaire Awards which is--which are given to outstanding--outstanding choreographer and female and male dancer of the season.  We're opening a new booth in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And isn't there a second booth on South Street [New York City, New York]?
Speaker 2: Yes, and when the World Trade Center went down [2001], unfortunately, we relocated our booth to the South Street Seaport.
Speaker 1: And what's happening with the booth that's right outside where we're sitting now?
Speaker 2: Duffy Square, for the first time in thirty years, Duffy Square will be a permanent building.
Speaker 1: So the building that's been there for thirty years was not permanent?
Speaker 2: It was a--it was a doublewide trailer.  It actually wasn't a building.  It was--that's why they called it the "trailer."  It was literally a trailer.  It was a temporary structure but this is going to be a green building, it's very exciting.  It's going to be constructed of all glass and as--because that Duffy Square is actually a park and as the last public space in Times Square, it represents an opportunity for people to come and sit in Times Square, experience Times Square and understand what theatre has brought to this area.
Speaker 1: You said it's a green building?
Speaker 2: It's going to be a green building.  It's going to--
Speaker 1: What's that mean?
Speaker 2: That means that it's going to be heated and cooled geothermally.  We drilled pylons four hundred feet into the ground so that the building will be heated and cooled by the earth.
Story_ID: 130328
Speaker 1: So what about the Lucille Lortel Awards?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I was a Tony [Awards] nominator for three seasons, very exciting opportunity.  The Lucille Lortel Awards are the Off-Broadway equivalent of the Tony Awards and so each season, and Off-Broadway is very prolific, I mean, I have to see 110 shows between--I started in August, by next May I will have seen 110 shows.
Speaker 1: So with the Lucille Lortel Awards, you're looking at a 110 shows?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And when you were Tony nominator, how many shows are you going to?
Speaker 2: Well, a season is generally about anywhere between 60 and 65 shows.
Speaker 1: And how do you handle that?  How do you manage that significant amount of viewing?
Speaker 2: That's my--that's my service to the field and it's, it's wonderful.  I mean it's, it's basically a commitment during the week to being in the theatre every night.
Story_ID: 130329
Speaker 1: So we're still talking about being a nominator for [the Lucille Lortel Awards]--we're talking Off-Broadway.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And you said you use your Playbill?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I use my Playbills because that lists everyone that's involved in the show, not only the performers but the technical staff because you're also addressing sets and lights and, you know, all of that, so--and costumes.
Speaker 1: So it's a different kind of tuned in, really.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.
Speaker 1: And does some of that kind of tuning happen with the students that you [Theatre Development Fund] do with Open Doors?  I mean, are you talking with them both about performance and about ambience, lights, costumes?
Speaker 2: Not at the moment.  I think that's what the--the further pursuit of the--of knowledge will bring to them but in the beginning it's about writing, it's about playwriting, it's about expression, it's about understanding.  The first Open Doors play that I saw was Wendy Wasserstein's 'American Daughter' and one of the characters, the African American character, is Jewish.  And so one of the kids said, now why was that?  How did you get there?  What was that process?  So it's all about understanding process and thinking and expression.  And that's what they, I think, benefit from the most is being able to express themselves, learning how to--how to put their thoughts into order and express themselves.
Speaker 1: And so that's the purpose of the journal?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is to get that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --happen--make that happen physically?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 130330
Speaker 1: You've been here for about ten years now?
Speaker 2: Yes, eleven years.
Speaker 1: And what do you see doing in the future with the Theatre Development Fund or--
Speaker 2: Or elsewhere.
Speaker 1: --elsewhere, yeah.
Speaker 2: I think I've come full circle.  I want to learn--I would like to go into the schools now.  I'd like to go into colleges and speak to students and really pass on my passion and--and the exchange would be good for both of us, I think, that's where, I think, I see myself heading.
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about a couple of people that we might not have spoken about.
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Irene Gandy.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Irene Gandy is one of the pioneers of African American women in the business.  I first met Irene when we were at--when I was at CBS and she was at Columbia Records and she was always involved in press.  And she was one of the first, and at the time, only African American press agents in the theatre business.  And she's still functioning.  Still doing shows and we're still friends and it's just really--it's a community in that way.  I mean, it's really, that's why we call it the campus, because it really is that.  And she's--she was also very involved in the National Black Theatre Festival in Winston-Salem [North Carolina] and she was involved in the Negro Ensemble Company [New York City, New York] in the day.  So I think we all want to get back to the point where there's more black theatre and that black theatre companies are thriving again because that isn't the case right now.
Speaker 1: Well the Negro Ensemble [Company] theatre is the main theatre that I hear about in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Are there any other--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --companies of note that we might talk about?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  [HM] Woodie King's New Federal Theatre [New York City] is the--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --is the last--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --really surviving black theatre company, and still producing and still producing groundbreaking work.  So Woodie is really wonderful.  And then I'm on the board of the Harlem Arts Alliance.  So there's a whole constituency of--in Harlem [New York] of theatre companies that are really producing great work.  And it doesn't have to be on Broadway.
Speaker 1: What about Caroline Jones?
Speaker 2: And Caroline is another case.  When I was doing my apprenticeship to join the union, I was house manager for a while at the Martin Beck Theatre and Caroline was the house manager at the St. James Theatre.  And so she and [HM] Stephanie Hughley, I mean, these were the--these were my idols, the women that I looked up to who had broken that barrier, were working in theatre and I'm happy to say that we're all still working in theatres.  Stephanie is running the Black Theatre Festival in Atlanta [Georgia], Caroline is the house manager at the Royale Theatre here in New York.
Speaker 1: So let's talk a little bit--I might have even hit them all.  What about the Alliance of New York State Arts Organization [Alliance of New York State Arts Organizations]?
Speaker 2: Organizations.  That--that is a new affiliation.  I just became Chairman of the Board of that.  They address advocacy for the arts on a statewide level and in terms of getting money for the arts.
Story_ID: 130331
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Okay, so we're talking a little bit about the New York State Alliance--Arts Alliance?  Start--
Speaker 1: Alliance of New York State Arts Organizations.  We've got to change our name, it's too long, but basically it's an advocacy organization that organizes on a statewide level to bring attention to the need for the arts in--in the total landscape but particularly in the schools and to fundraise for that.  The New York State Council on the Arts funding is an annual battle so we have to go to Albany and bring attention to the plight of, you know, the arts and--
Speaker 2: Why don't states understand how important and critical arts are to the growth of individuals?
Speaker 1: It's a very good question but because they used to take it for granted because it was part of the curriculum.  It's no longer a part of the curriculum.  So we have to fill that gap and I don't think that the states understand that.  And, you know, I went to Washington [D.C.] when the Clintons [President Bill Clinton] were in office and they were really good about funding the NEA [National Endowment for the Arts], which is the national level of arts.
Speaker 2: The Endowment for the Arts.
Speaker 1: But the state has to make up that difference.  In other words, otherwise these small arts organizations can't survive.
Speaker 2: What about the League of Professional Theatre Women?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was--that's a really great organization, as well, that was founded about fifteen years ago and it's basically a coalition of women who work in the industry who have come together to try to leverage what we have in--in terms of professional expertise to bring attention to women working in the arts.  It's really difficult.  You'd be surprised.  There just aren't that many women who are able to earn a living working in the arts and so we're trying to do something about that.
Speaker 2: And they certainly--you certainly don't know everyone.
Speaker 1: That's right.  You certainly don't.
Speaker 2: There's no--
Speaker 1: It's a great opportunity to network.

Speaker 1: How did you meet your husband [Jack Butler]?
Speaker 2: Oh, the joy of my life.  This is a--this, this is a direct benefit of serving for NYSCA, the New York State Council on the Arts, one of my panelist--former--my panelist members invited me to a Christmas party at his house in New Paltz, New York, ninety minutes upstate and in walks Mr. Butler with another friend, Joan Harris, that I knew from television many years ago and he was taking photos all night long.  And if he was here, that's what he would be doing right now, he'd be photographing you.  So at the end of the--we got together for breakfast the next morning, he presented me with this photo of myself, and we've been together ever since.  So, we got married two years ago in Hawaii and it was a great, great celebration and it's just one--it's part of the spiritual journey I have to say.  It's really a great collaboration, a great partnership.
Speaker 1: What does he do?
Speaker 2: Well, Jack, his name is Jack Butler, Jack, when he finished Harvard Business School [Cambridge, Massachusetts], moved to Africa, lived in Kenya for fifteen years as a developer and built housing and when he came back in 1985, he established his own business systems consultancy.  So, he has his own list of clients and he's up in New Paltz and I'm in the city [New York City, New York] during the week and on the weekends we have our time together, and it's really great.
Speaker 1: Now, I've got to just ask about your folks.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, after a few years in New York--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and Senegal with the Jackson Five, what does your daddy [Leander Warner] say?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  He finally got it.  He said, I don't know--you know, he finally understood that there was room in the world for this.  My dad's a real old fashioned kind of guy and I think that he was just afraid for me all the time and then he stopped being afraid.  So we were--it was a good thing.  I wish he could have met my husband [Jack Butler] but my dad passed away right before I met him.  They would have liked each other.  He didn't like most of the men in my life but he would have liked Jack.  My mom [Margie Warner] loves Jack.  They are really good friends and my husband has a ninety-year old mother [Marjorie Butler] who founded the Black Studies Program at SUNY New Paltz [State University of New York at New Paltz].
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: And so, yeah.  That's really special and so I'm looking forward to hopefully establishing a relationship with SUNY New Paltz in the near future.
Story_ID: 130333
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we haven't talked about that we should?
Speaker 2: The importance of this program.  I think it's really crucial.
Speaker 1: The HistoryMakers?
Speaker 2: That is, The HistoryMakers is a wonderful idea concept, needs to be and I--you know, just enlarged and I think that it's a wonderful platform for us to talk about ourselves.  It's not something I do often or very well but it's a great opportunity to do that.
Speaker 1: You're doing great today.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Do you see a future for this vision that you have of, what I'm going to term, equal-opportunity marketing for theatres such that there is a rise in the theatre-going community?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  I think if we don't, theatre will die and we just can't let that happen.  I mean, we all have stories to tell and we have to be able to tell those stories in a context that allows us to share them, and that's, I think, the importance of it and I--that's my passion.
Speaker 1: And when you finish your career and retire to Hawaii, perhaps, where do you--
Speaker 2: New Paltz [New York] (laughter).
Speaker 1: To New Paltz.  What do you have a sense that you'd like to leave behind for those who've come behind you?
Speaker 2: The idea that you should never give up.  The idea that nothing is impossible.  The idea that hard work will prevail over anything.  That's what I think I'd like to leave behind.
Speaker 1: Oh, and then, I'd like you to articulate where we were speaking about a little bit earlier, where you were saying students today might not understand that, you know, sort of a getting out there and taking it one step at a time approach.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Really worked for you.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  And that is that you--you must apply yourself.  I mean, I hear my mother [Margie Warner].  My mother used to say that to me, but you must apply yourself and just because you have an education doesn't mean that you're not going to have the--meet those bumps and, you know, and have hard times, but you've got to fight your way through.
Speaker 1: And perhaps if you don't have an education--
Speaker 2: Don't give up.
Speaker 1: --a similar stepping--
Speaker 2: That's exactly right.  Don't give up, just--you have to persevere, I mean, you just have to understand that.  No one can say no to you but you and if you take that attitude, you will--it will take you a lot of places.
Speaker 1: Well, I want to thank you and The HistoryMakers wants to thank you for talking with us today.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: And for, you know, picking up yourself from Indianapolis [Indiana] and coming to New York [New York City, New York] and moving into the city in two weeks and, you know, clipping The New York Times and going to work at CBS because it gives us an opportunity to speak with you and to learn about theatre and we really appreciate that.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.  See more of you.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 130334
Speaker 1: So do you have some interesting people that you think we should interview through The HistoryMakers project?
Speaker 2: I do and I--and among those, because there are lots in different areas, their business, there's, you know, performance and one performer would be Kenn Hicks [Kenneth Hicks] who is a wonderful opera singer who recently did a concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center that he produced himself and he is an opera singer who has melded jazz with opera and the outcome and I just want to play for you one of the things that--
Speaker 1: Is that a first?
Speaker 2: It's, in my opinion, it's a first successfully.  I know a lot of people try to do it but it doesn't quite work and, why don't we take a listen and you can tell me what you think.
Speaker 1: Okay, fantastic.
Speaker 2: And he's got [HM] Herbie Hancock, Marcus Miller.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: This is called "Avanti" and he wrote this next piece himself, I believe.  So it's kind of African and it's opera and jazz.
Speaker 1: It also sounds like Paris [France].
Speaker 2: Yeah, it does, doesn't it.  So let me find "Nessun Dorma" because that's a song that we all know.  Nope that's not it.  That's not it.  Where's "Nessun Dorma"?  Oh, he wrote that one.  And he writes his own songs.  Sorry.  That's not it.  That's not it.  That's the gospel piece.  I must have skipped it.
Speaker 1: You might have hit it and then, you know, not recognized it right away.
Speaker 2: And this is his rendition of "Nessun Dorma" which was a really big success at the Jazz at Lincoln Center concert.
Speaker 1: And this is Kenn Hicks?
Speaker 2: Kenn Hicks.
Speaker 1: And you said he's an opera singer and he's joined up--well he's included Herbie Hancock and you mentioned someone else?
Speaker 2: Yes, and Marcus Miller were the artists on the CD and at the concert.  Oh, that's terrible, I don't know what's happening.  There, that's just a sample of his work but he's a very talented artist and is bridging the gap, I think, in many ways in the culture.
Speaker 1: And, so you think that it makes him accessible to the people who might not be interested in opera?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Prior to hearing him?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, and it changes the face of opera in Europe and that's what he's done with his concerts abroad.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that he's brought another feel, another cultural impact to opera, just by being African American.

Speaker 1: Okay.  This is the opening night of Lena Horne, 'The Lady and Her Music' in Chicago [Illinois] at the Blackstone Theatre, backstage, and Sherman Sneed is Lena's manager is in the middle, and then Ms. Horne and myself and Lena is disputing some story that he had just told us.  I was sort of like agreeing with her.  We always had great fun.
Speaker 2: Ready?  This is where it all began in 1948 in Indianapolis [Indiana], circa 1948.  My mother [Margie Warner] dressed me and set me on the path.
Speaker 1: This is my graduation photograph from Shortridge [Public] High School in Indianapolis in 1966.
Speaker 2: And this is one of my exciting adventures when I moved to New York [New York City, New York].  I met a guy who had a camera lab and he would let us borrow equipment.  And I remember one year schlepping all the way to Brooklyn to do "Black Family Day" and somewhere I have that tape.
Speaker 1: And this was the photograph for the Playbill in Japan for 'Sophisticated Ladies.'  They required that we--all the production staff had photographs.
Speaker 2: This is a photograph from 'Wonderama' at Metromedia Television Channel Five when we came back from Africa with the Jackson Five and this was for the kids and they just loved it, 1974.
Speaker 1: Les Jackson Cinq.
Speaker 2: Les Jackson Cinq.
Speaker 1: And, again, this is 'Wonderama' rather at Channel Five and this is Sister Sledge, who was a very popular singing group in the day.  "We Are Family."
Speaker 2: "We Are Family."
Speaker 1: "We Are Family," that's it.
Speaker 2: "I got all my sisters"--
Speaker 1: And this is the wonderful incomparable Eubie Blake at the age of ninety-six on 'Wonderama.'  He was playing a song called "If you've never been vamped by a brown skin, you've never been vamped at all."
Speaker 2: Hey! (laughter)
Speaker 1: This is the Astaire Awards, which is Fred Astaire Awards, which are given every year for outstanding choreography, female and male dancer of the year, and this particular year it was given to Garth Fagan on the right for 'Lion King' and Graziella Daniell on the left for 'Ragtime' and Brian Stokes Mitchell was our host.

Speaker 1: This is my mother Margie Warner with Lily Tomlin and her dog and this was backstage, opening night, in Los Angeles [California] in 1986.

Speaker 1: Poor Michael [Jackson].  I do feel sorry for him.
Speaker 2: I feel bad for him.
Speaker 1: He's lost.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he really was the man.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  What was it about?
Speaker 1: He probably just never got the development.
Speaker 2: No he didn't.
Speaker 1: I mean he probably didn't have a chance.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Also surrounded by just everybody, you know.
Speaker 1: His parents, apparently were--
Speaker 2: Uh-hum.
Speaker 1: Delicate.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is a great photo.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  You see, I would go in but they asked me not to--
Speaker 2: Not to--
Speaker 1: This is an event at the Nigerian Embassy--at the United Nations [new York City].  Gabriel Oromacelli [ph.] who worked for Newsweek and it was just during an era when there was more participation in the African community by African Americans and would like to see those--see that happen again.
Speaker 2: Fell off your forehead.
Speaker 1: This is me at work on 'Midday Live.'  We were doing an outside shoot and it was just a day at the office in television.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  About what time was this event?
Speaker 1: This was 1975.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  This is for Metromedia?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Metromedia.
Speaker 2: This is Caroline Jones who was house manager of the St. James Theatre in New York and me at the opening night of 'Dracula' and I was the house manager of the Martin Beck Theatre.  'Dracula' is starring Frank Langella.  That would have been 1977.
Speaker 1: This is the lobby of the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles [California] and this is a group of kids from the Helping Hands Home for Boys who were visiting the theatre.  They're going to be so happy to see themselves.
Speaker 2: Gee, we need a HistoryMakers channel?
Speaker 1: You do.
Speaker 2: And we'd just play interviews all day long.
Speaker 1: Oh, I like that.
Speaker 2: That would be great.
Speaker 1: Let's go to work.
