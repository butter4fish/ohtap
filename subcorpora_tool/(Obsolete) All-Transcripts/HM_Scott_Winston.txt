Speaker 1: Now, now before we go into depth there are five light weight questions that we always ask as a warm up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: No, I have many favorite foods (laugh).  No one particular favorite food.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I suppose red, I guess.
Speaker 1: Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is probably Christmas.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No one favorite vacation destination.  I enjoy many places.
Speaker 1: The last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, favorite phrase or saying.  No one particular phrase, I have a particular philosophy but I don't know if I can boil that down to one phrase.  It's a philosophy about two things necessary for success is being prepared for opportunities when they come and then recognizing those opportunities.  So when opportunity meets preparation then the person will be successful.

Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but separately then we will put them together.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So can you give us first your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother-- and she is deceased now.  It's R-U-B-Y-E, L-E-E, her maiden name was D-A-W-S-O-N but of course her married name was Scott.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Well, her date of birth was February 5 and I don't really know the year and I'm not sure I think she was born in Midland, Pennsylvania.  That's where she grew up M-I-D-L-A-N-D, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: So do you think she was born in the '20s [1920s], do you think? 19--
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father was 1917 she must have been 1922 or '23 [1923] or something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Speaker 2: She's a few years younger than my father but February 5 was her birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell us what you know about the ancestors, your ancestors on your mother's side, how far back can you trace them and what are the stories?
Speaker 2: Not very much, we don't know very much about my mother's ancestors.  My mother was raised by a lady named Burie Dawson, B-U-R-I-E Dawson.  But my mother and her brother were actually adopted by my grandma Burie.  So we don't know much about my mom's real mother and father, that part of the history at least was lost to me as a youngster growing up.  But grandma Burie and my mother and two stepsisters lived in Midland, Pennsylvania.  My mother had a brother, Jimmy Dawson and again these were stepsiblings as I understand it; Thelma Jackson and Jessie Jackson, Jessie as a woman, two sisters Thelma and Jessie Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother never really--did she know who her biological parents were?
Speaker 2: I believe she found out later on in life, after, after I was up and out.  I think she reconnected with her birth mom but I don't know that myself-- I don't know much about that.  It's unfortunate a lot of families go that way even today but especially back then.  There were so many difficulties that people have to deal with.
Speaker 1: So Ms. Dawson raised her from a baby?
Speaker 2: That's right, or a real young girl.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, okay.
Speaker 2: And the way the story goes is that my mother and her brother were actually abandoned. They were in a house living by themselves as young children and they were found.  My grandma Burie took them in and raised them as her own children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's a, that's a heck of a story to start off.
Speaker 2: That's an interesting story, it is.
Speaker 1: Abandoned in a-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's-- Now where is Midland?
Speaker 2: The nearest large place is Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].  I don't know exactly how far Pittsburgh is away from Midland but that's the largest city.  Midland was a steel town, I do know that.  The Steel mill was a main source of employment back in the old days.
Story_ID: 27791
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Rubye Lee Dawson]--was she able to finish high school?
Speaker 2: She finished high school and one or two years of college at Fort Valley back then it was Fort Valley State College [now Fort Valley State University, Fort Valley, Georgia] I think it was.  So she did a couple of years there and then she married my father.  And once she got married she moved to my father's home while he went away to the Army in World War II. (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) Okay. So she must have been a decent student?
Speaker 2: She was a very good student, in fact she was the teacher in--she moved to Quitman, Georgia that's where my father is from.  So small rural Quitman needed a teacher and my mother actually taught school there.  She taught K [kindergarten] thru twelve and again in those days in rural, segregated schools she was the most educated person in the community therefore she was the teacher so she actually taught school.  She didn't have a four year degree but had one or two years of college and taught school in Midland, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's the way they would do it in those days.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So did she have like a normal degree or something from Fort Valley?
Speaker 2: Well again no I don't think she had a degree at all because back then if you didn't get a four year degree I don't think you got anything.
Speaker 1: You could get a normal degree like a two year--like an associate's that would qualify you to teach.
Speaker 2: (simultaneous) Yeah, I, I-- I don't believe so.  There is a lot of detail I don't know.  I just know that she did a year or two of college.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could teach with a two year normal degree--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, in those rural schools.
Speaker 2: Right, that's a possibility.  I suspect that if she had a normal degree I would know that fact.  I just believe she spent a year or two in college, got married and, and in those days of course, the wife moved to the husband's home and lived with my father's mother and father. Moved in with the her in-laws while my dad went off--drafted in World War II.
Story_ID: 27792
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My father was named Alston James Scott, that's A-L-S-T-O-N, J-A-M-E-S, S-C-O-T-T.
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is August 23, 1917.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Quitman, Q-U-I-T-M-A-N, Georgia.  And Quitman is in south Georgia just across the line from Tallahassee, Florida. Small farming community.  Some people know Waycross, Thomasville and Valdosta and those places, kind of in that area.
Speaker 1: Where Ossie Davis is from down in that area, Waycross--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.  I didn't know that Ossie Davis--Waycross, Valdosta, Tipton, Georgia.  I didn't know Ossie was from there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, now-- Well, what can you tell us about your father's ancestors?
Speaker 2: I know a little bit more about my father's ancestors.  They were from Quitman and his father was named William Scott and William Scott married Eddie Mae Thomas.  And of course she-- so those are my grandparents on my father's side.  And, let's see, papa William Scott-no, my grandmother Eddie Mae Scott's mother was a grandma Laura Thomas. And I believe grandma Laura's parents were slaves, were still back in slavery time. Anyway I was--
Speaker 1: That makes sense.
Speaker 2: I was a baby when Grandma Laura was still alive.  I don't remember her I was too little but I know grandma Laura was still living.  So grandpapa William and grandmamma Eddie Mae Scott lived in Quitman, Georgia on the farm.  My father was next to the youngest of thirteen children that grandma Eddie Mae birthed.  Of the thirteen I want to say six or so survived and that he was next to the youngest.  Grandma Eddie Mae lived to be a hundred and seven. She was almost a hundred and eight when she died, so longevity runs in the family.
Speaker 1: A hundred and seven years old.
Speaker 2: A hundred and seven years old. And they were farmers and lived in the rural farming community of Quitman.  Of course, even farming was segregated back then.
Speaker 1: Did they own their own land?
Speaker 2: They owned their own land, how many acres I don't know, it seemed like a lot to me as a kid.  We used to go visit them on the farm in the-during the summers.  And they grew corn, tobacco, beans, peas, watermelons, the whole-- all the typical southern crops. Sell them at market.
Speaker 1: Do you know or is there a story in the family about whether the family had been there since slavery?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Since the end of slavery, since Emancipation?
Speaker 1: I, I believe so but I don't know for a fact.
Speaker 2: I was wondering if there was a story about how the land was acquired.
Speaker 1: I have no idea; never heard any story to that effect.
Story_ID: 27793
Speaker 1: So farming was the occupation-
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --up until the time that your--and your father [Alston James Scott] continued the, the tradition--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Well, my father grew up on the farm and then went off to a--he was drafted during World War II.  He left Quitman [Georgia] and went to serve in the Army, he served two years.  He was in the European theater in Germany and once his enlistment in the Army was up, he, of course, returned to the states and like a lot of people back then looked for jobs and as I understand it his sister, my aunt was living in Miami [Florida] at the time, she had gotten married and moved to Miami.  She sent word to him if you come to Miami you can get work down here.  He went down to Miami looking for a job and he first worked in the nursery business, you know, with a company that did landscaping and things like that but then, it's an interesting story, my father got on with the post office--he got hired with the post office down there after many trials and tribulations; that's a story in and of itself.  But he became-- he and a guy named John Friar got hired that same day.  They became the first two African Americans to carry mail in Miami.  The jobs were segregated, blacks couldn't carry mail those jobs were reserved for whites but he was-- he and John Friar was the first two African Americans to carry mail in Miami.  In fact, when he retired, thirty-seven years later he was the most senior black postman in the United States.  And he was the number seven senior postman of all in the United States when he retired.  I didn't know this until he retired and the mayor and the governor, everybody came and gave him all these accolades for him, they gave him all these awards and recognition with newspaper articles and I said, "Good God, I didn't know my dad did all of this".  But he broke the color-- color barrier in carrying mail.  Mail carrying, that's a good job, good profession.
Speaker 1: He had to be consistent, you know, and dependable, right?
Speaker 2: He had to be consistent, and dependable.  Ever since the days of the pony express carrying mail and you know air mail, those were good solid jobs that anybody couldn't get.  And like I say, they were segregated so I don't know if there was a union thing but they were segregated. And he was the first-- he and John Friar hired to carry mail.
Speaker 1: I imagine the government was compelled to bring on some black postman after awhile-- this is the kind of thing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't know that and in talking to him and reading the accounts I don't think the government was compelled, I think just the, the local postmaster just needed people, just needed workers and he was of the mind that, "I don't care what color you are if you do a job, we need you."  My father had stories to tell.  When he first started carrying mail people were calling and complain that, "This N-word, I don't want him near my door carrying mail." And they would sic the dogs on him-- you know, they turn the dogs loose and go after him and so on.  And it took him several tries to get hired because they would have him drive the trucks and Miami used little scooters. They had big trucks but they also used these motorized scooters that carry, you know, small--.  The first few times people would say things like, "He didn't drive well, or he didn't handle the equipment right or he handled the equipment too rough."  So finally he overcame all of that and got hired.  He thought he was going to be hired temporarily just for the Christmas surge, all the extra mail during Christmas, he figured he would be fired after Christmas and that they would go to Cleveland, Ohio, I guess where they had lived before.  But it turned out he wasn't fired, he stayed there and finished his career thirty-seven years later as a postman or thirty-nine years whatever it was.  His total government time including Army was forty-one years but thirty-seven of that I think was with the post office.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't easy being the first black--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: It wasn't easy--it's like being the first black of anything it wasn't easy at all.  He had a lot of trials and tribulations, and again he never talked about this.  I found out about it when he retired and they started giving him all these accolades and writing articles about him.  It's kind of funny when you find out stuff like that about your parents that you never knew; you live with them and you never knew these things.
Speaker 1: Being a postman in those days was a, a very good job--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Postman is a very good job, especially in the African American community.  Like I said, it was a rock solid employment, you had to be dependable and you carried a certain amount of prestige.  There is the government uniform, the post office was under the federal government at that time and so there wasn't very many of us doing those jobs; just like the police department, fire department.  I'm old enough to remember when the first black motorcycle police officer was hired in Miami, I was a little kid but I remember it.  You know, things like riding-- a motorcycle cop is a big deal; a police officer in general in those days, we don't think much of it now but we did back then.  Bus driver--blacks couldn't be metro bus drivers for a long while, well you know this stuff but--.
Speaker 1: I'm glad you're saying it because this-- the audience that's watching this don't-- doesn't necessarily know this.  Hopefully this will be around for hundreds of years.
Speaker 2: Hopefully it will be around for hundreds of years.
Speaker 1: And people will know.
Speaker 2: But, but those were some very good jobs and jobs that African Americans were not allowed to hold.  So I remember when we had the first bus drivers in Miami and the first, well, police officers were mainly--the motorcycle squad I guess was kind of like the elite, at least they thought they were elite.  So the first motorcycle cop was written up in 'The Miami Times' which was, of course, the all black newspaper there in Miami.  So, those, those were some significant events for us.
Story_ID: 27794
Speaker 1: Now, now is there story about--now your parents met before your father [Alston James Scott] went off to war, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, and--.
Speaker 1: Is, is there a story about how they met and--?
Speaker 2: The way I understand it (laugh)-I keep saying the way I understand it, because remember I wasn't even born.  And people didn't talk about all of this stuff kind of the way we talk about things today.  As I understand it my father was actually on his way from Quitman to Cleveland, Ohio, I think to work.  He had some kind of job there and someone told him that you should stop through Midland, Pennsylvania and visit your aunt, somebody, visit a relative.  And when he was visiting a relative, my mother [Rubye Lee Dawson] happened to be visiting at the same time.  So he met her, they met just by chance during this visit and got to know each other and four weeks later they were married.  And then he got drafted and sent off to the War [World War II].  Now, that four weeks of knowing each other and got married they were married for fifty-two years before my mother died.  So that's, that's kind of the story as I understand it.
Speaker 1: And he met the right one.
Speaker 2: He met the right one.  I think when he first saw her I believe he made up his mind, said, "Okay, that's the woman I'm going to marry." She probably felt the same way 'cause it only took them four weeks.  Like I say they were married fifty-two years before she passed away.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  That's something. And so, when your mother went down--she moved to Georgia--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, they got married, my dad went off to the Army, she moved to Georgia to stay with his folks on the farm in Quitman [Georgia].
Speaker 1: And taught school?
Speaker 2: Taught school that's right.
Speaker 1: Had the highest degree there at the time, you were saying. The most educated (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, she was the most highly educated in that rural black community.  I think she taught at Simmon Hill, I believe the name of the school was Simmon Hill School.  There's a Simmon School Baptist Church, in fact, Simmon Hill is still there, Simmon Hill Baptist Church and there is a school attached to it and that's where the local black children went to school.  I believe, pretty sure obviously there had to be one room because she was the only teacher, she had K thru twelve [kindergarten through twelfth grade].
Story_ID: 27795
Speaker 1: When, when you think about your parents' personalities, disposition, sense of humor, what they-- their opinions, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like, who do you think you take after?
Speaker 2: I take after my father, no doubt about that.  My father [Alston James Scott] was tall and slim, like me, and people would tell me-- have always told me I look like my father.  So there is no doubt about that.  My mother [Rubye Lee Dawson] was real short, she was a real short lady, my mother was under five feet, she was only four foot something or other and my father was six foot one or whatever.  But they were a nice looking couple and very distinguished and they valued education very highly.  They always taught us that education was number one thing that you had to achieve in your life.  My father finished high school, and of course, a lot of men didn't get to go to college back then black or white.  He's from a small rural Quitman [Georgia]-- couldn't go to college. He was a very smart person, I think he would have done well college had those opportunities came about.  He read a lot; they were always up on current events.  They read newspapers and read books and magazines so they knew what was going on in the world.  They were very highly in tuned if not formerly educated, very highly educated.  They both had a real high work ethic, like I said my father got on at the post office that took a lot of effort to do that and my mother-- when we-- the first job I remember her having as a youngster was being a stock girl at Burdines Department Store in Miami and people that have been around Miami [Florida] a lot will remember Burdines Department Store.  She worked in the candy department, I remember that because we were little kids and sometimes she would bring home candy, big boxes of candy.  I learned all of this later, she was, her job was a stock girl but I remember she was taking courses at night, she started taking night courses at high school and she was learning to type and do shorthand and so on.  And she wound up getting a job as a secretary at Northwestern High School.  So she moved from being stock girl up to being a secretary at the high school, Northwestern High School, Northwestern, of course, is still there, historically black high school.  Then she became assistant librarian, I believe, then she became librarian, then she eventually retired as the office manager for the principal at Northwestern High School.  So my point is, my parents always continued to work up, to go higher and higher.  They took courses at night, they studied, they read and they always did the best they could with the resources they had available.  My father was active in the school system.  When I was in elementary school he would come out occasionally and visit my classes and I was in second or third grade.  Every once and awhile my father would come to school and visit and sit in the back of the room. (unclear) I'm serious.
Speaker 1: That's remarkable. I've heard (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was the only father I ever saw in my life to do that.
Speaker 1: That's the only one I've heard of.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he'd come out every once and while just to visit the school, just to see what we were doing.  He later became president of the PTA, the Parent Teacher Association at my elementary school and he was superintendant of the Sunday school and he became a deacon, he was an ordained deacon in the church, so-- he was president of the Postal Alliance at one point.  The Postal Alliance, of course, is the I guess it's a national postal alliance; it was the organization for the African American postman.  He always assumed leadership positions in whatever he was involved in and he was very actively involved.  So there actions of where they lived really inspired us to do the best you could and try to rise as high as you, as you could go.  We always had to do our homework and do well in school.
Speaker 1: Now was you father a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, father, mother members of the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've been a member all my life too and to be quite honest I probably shouldn't say this on camera my dues probably aren't paid at the moment, but I've been a member of the NAACP my entire adult life.  I have done speeches for them as I moved from place to place and they ask me to do a banquet or whatever I gone out, reached out and done a speech or presentation or whatever.  So the NAACP has always been big in my family, not just my father and mother but cousins and aunts and uncles.
Story_ID: 27796
Speaker 1: Tell me about your siblings, now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have an older sister and a younger brother.  My sister is a retired teacher, taught for I want to say forty-one years.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Her name is R-U-B-Y-E, her middle name is LaVerne, L-A- capital V -E-R-N-E now her married name is Neely but obviously her maiden name was Scott.  She is a retired teacher, she taught foreign languages, she taught Spanish in high school in West Palm Beach [Florida], but she taught French and German for the local college as an adjunct at night, so she majored in foreign languages.  Went to school-- she was a freshman in college at sixteen.  She went to Talladega College in [Talladega] Alabama and then received her master's degree at I want to say University of New York at New Paltz, P-A-L-Z or P-A-L-T-Z, New Paltz, New York. University of-- the New York University system.   But anyway, so she taught and she is retired now.  And my brother, my younger brother is retired also. He retired a few years ago from the Sheriff's Department at Atlanta, Georgia.  He was a lieutenant on the Fulton County Sheriff's Department in Atlanta.  He went to the Miami Police Academy [Miami, Florida] and then wound up in Atlanta as a sheriff's deputy and spent a full career up there but he is retired now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is your brother's name?
Speaker 2: His name is Alston, Alston J. Scott, Jr. my father's name but he is junior.
Speaker 1: Now he's, he's--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: He's younger but he is the junior.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright, okay. So you're in, you are the second one--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I'm in the middle. I'm the middle child, that's right. Oldest son but middle child.
Speaker 1: Alright.  Alston, Jr.  Okay.  Is there, are there any more?
Speaker 2: No just the three kids--three siblings.
Speaker 1: Just the three-- Okay.
Story_ID: 27797
Speaker 1: Did you grow up in Overtown [Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: No, I grew up in Coconut Grove [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Coconut Grove, okay.
Speaker 2: Coconut Grove.  I remember Overtown.
Speaker 1: Coconut Grove. Okay, alright. What was it like in Coconut Grove in those days?
Speaker 2: In those days in was really nice.  It was-- We felt very secure in the community, of course, our neighborhoods were segregated.  We lived in the black section of Coconut Grove.  In fact, it's real funny, I was watching this show one time called 'Life Styles of the Rich and Famous' and they showed Coconut Grove and I stopped and looked at it and they showed all these yachts and boats (laugh) and I said, "That's not the Coconut Grove I grew up in."  But I grew up in the segregated section of Coconut Grove.  But we had our own stores and schools and barber shops and the whole bit.  But it was a really good neighborhood, the neighborhood was clean and well-kept and it was, it was a safe neighborhood.  We could walk all over the Grove day or night going to Boy Scout meetings when I was a youngest and we would go to Boy Scout meetings in the evenings and nobody bothered us.  Now like any community there was the rough element--there was kind of a hoodlum element but you knew who and where it was and you just stayed away from it.  You mind your own business and they mind their own business and it was a relatively safe place.  Unlike now things seem to be so bad all over not just the Grove but all communities now seemed to be so bad.  An element of unsafe-- you know, schools are even unsafe, well back then we felt safe in the community.  Good solid community, everybody knew each other.  Even though this was Miami, it was a large community, a lot of people knew-- everybody knew everybody and people knew my father [Alston James Scott] because he was the postman.  If you said Mr. Scott people would say, "Oh yeah, Mr. Scott the mailman." Pretty, pretty much everyone knew him. And everybody knew us as kids.  Back then adults could discipline any, any kid, if they saw you doing something wrong they would keep you in line, they would say something to you.  And you respected all adults and because you knew what it was if it would get back to your parents.  So it was really a close, tight knit community where everybody kind of looked out for everybody else.  There was a lot of good kids in the community, a lot of talented, smart kids in the community.  There wasn't a lot of the kind of mentoring you need to-- like they have today.  All these special programs for students to help them go to college and so on, we didn't have those back then.  We had a lot of tremendously talented and smart young people in a segregated community.
Story_ID: 27798
Speaker 1: So this is single family homes in your neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely. Well, in my neighborhood there were both single family homes but there were also the areas, I can't think of a better name for it. We called them the projects.  I can't remember if that's the proper name for it but some of the kids that I grew up with lived in what we called the projects and that's what we called it.  There wasn't anything detrimental about it, that's just where they lived.  Some of the kids lived in apartments up on Grand Avenue.  We lived in a single family home.  We started out with one on Thomas Avenue and then my father moved us to a larger home over on Frow Avenue.  Now the house we lived in on Frow Avenue had been in what was originally a white community.  Now here is white flight because as black families began to move in the white families moved out.  It was really, realy interesting to experience that.
Speaker 1: So Miami [Florida] in those days just from what I understand, general information is that it is growing so fast that, you know, I get-- that kind of expansion wasn't even traumatic for white people, probably in the sense that new housing was being created all the time.  So as black people, you know, moved up they could find real estate.
Speaker 2: I, I think so, again I was a little kid, and I was in third grade when we moved from one house to another.  So that larger view escapes me I just know that we moved from a real small house on Thomas Avenue to a larger house on Frow Avenue.  And white people had traditionally lived on Frow and as we moved in, it was an older house but very nice, much nicer than what we had, it wasn't a brand new house but we moved in there were still a couple of white families in the community, a few blacks.  The white families gradually moved out and other blacks moved in.  So here you see the black community expanding and then the whites in the area moving out.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.  But schools were basically segregated?
Speaker 2: Oh schools were segregated, yeah, no doubt about it. Schools were all segregated.
Speaker 1: Were they segregated by rule or was it defacto basically?
Speaker 2: I think it was defacto because Brown v. The Board of Education was in '54 [1954], well, this was 1960-something and they were still segregated so the community hadn't gotten around to doing it yet for whatever reason.  The schools were still segregated.  We integrated schools in Miami in 1965 or whatever because I was in one of the first classes to go over and integrate Coral Gables High School.  Coral Gables was historically white and this big change all came about at one time where all of the black--almost all of the historically black high schools were made junior high schools and the black students went over to the neighboring predominantly white school.  This happened pretty much everyplace except Northwestern.  Northwestern was the one black high school that remained a senior high school and to this day it's still a senior high school and still I believe predominantly black.  But Booker T [Washington High School], Mays [High School], Carver [George Washington Carver Senior High School], Dillard [High School] and some of the other historically black high schools all were made into junior high schools.  And then the black students there upon reaching tenth grade went to the predominantly white high school.

Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I have, I have to think about which was the very earliest. I can remember being registered for--getting to register for first grade.  I was in Georgia in the summertime with my sister visiting me.  I remember somebody asking me, "Are you going to school yet?" or whatever, "What grade are you in?"  I can remember my older sister [Rubye LaVerne Neely] said, "Oh, well, he is getting ready to go to first grade."  I remember later on being taken out to the school and being registered, they had to fill out a card or whatever for first grade so I was probably five years old then.  I can remember kindergarten. I attended St. Albans Day Nursery School in Miami.  St. Albans I think is still there to this day, I believe it is anyway.  But I attended St. Albans Day Nursery I have a few memories of kindergarten.  And a Mrs. Daniels, I remember Mrs. Daniels and Ms. Lavonne I think are the two teachers I remember in a all black kindergarten so again I must have been maybe four years old.  I doubt if I can remember anything much back past four years old (laugh), four or five years old.

Speaker 1: What were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights-- the earliest sight I remember was in the afternoon my father [Alston James Scott] would put my brother [Alston James Scott Jr.] and I in the car and drive us downtown to pick my mother [Ruby Lee Dawson] up from work.  She was working at Burdines at the time.  We would ride down the highway and my brother and I would be in the back seat and my father was driving.  We, like kids do, kind of bounced up in the air as you go over the intersections and there is the main highway would pass the intersecting roads there was a little hump and the car would go over it and my brother and I would bounce around in the back seat as my dad would drive us downtown to pick up my mother from work at Burdines [Department Story].  I can remember one time, it's interesting how certain things can stick out in your mind, this motorcycle pulled on the side of us as we were riding. I remember looking at a car and looking at this guy riding this motorcycle and that caught my attention and I said, "Boy, that looks like fun. I wish I could do that." So this, this whizzing next to us on the motorcycle.  For some reason that stands out in my mind because we were going over the bumps and bouncing around and playing around in the backseat my father was driving.
Speaker 1: Are those the seeds of being a test pilot?
Speaker 2: (laugh) Well, I don't know about that I just know that motorcycle was cool looking, it was fast and, and the car was fast and we were bouncing around and having a good time.  But that was, I mean, I was a little kid; I bet you I was four or five years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's, but the, but the, so, but the different-- What I remember, that's one specific scene. In general, I remember Coconut Grove and Miami [Florida] being a very vibrant place.  A lot of people, always a lot going on; there were things to do, it was a city, you know.  It was all kind of activities going on and in school growing up there were plenty of activities.  Growing up, in elementary school we had little parties and dances and high school, of course, there was football games, a marching band and I played a lot of rock groups growing up and rhythm and blues as a trumpet player and back then we had the big soul bands.  Everybody had a band on every corner so we played James Brown and imitated the Temptations and the Four Tops and the Barkays you name it, it was a vibrant place, just a lot going on, a lot of excitement.

Speaker 1: Now you started at St. Albans Day Nursery [Miami, Florida]-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and you went from there to Carver--.
Speaker 2: Carver. George Washington Carver Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went there until fourth grade, then they built Francis S. Tucker Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I don't want to get you too far.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I want to ask you about when you were at Carver, that's when the Russians sent up Sputnik [first manmade satellite of earth], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, Sputnik was '56 [1956]--
Speaker 1: '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: '57 [1957]. Yeah I was in second grade--first or second grade.
Speaker 1: First or second.
Speaker 2: I wasn't aware of it in first grade.
Speaker 1: You didn't talk about it in school?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember hearing anything about Sputnik then. But I do remember, I do remember an emphasis on public events.  I remember one time and this was in first grade my very first grade classroom, you know, you used to have the announcements over the loud speaker, I don't know if they do that these days but we used to have morning devotion, then you have announcements and it would all come over the PA system.  Well, this, one day this girl, an upper classman and I don't know who she was came into our class, she had a hand full of pennies and I found out later there was a student in every other class and over the loud speaker they had this little contest and they would ask questions and the student that would answer the question would get a penny.  I answered more questions than anybody else in there.  They asked who was the President of the United States; it was Dwight D. Eisenhower.  Who was the school board superintendant, it was Joe Hall and I can't remember what else they asked but I had more (laugh), I had more pennies than anybody else.  I think I had enough pennies to go buy a candy bar or something at the end. This was in first grade.  Funny how little things come back to you.
Speaker 1: And you were competing against--?
Speaker 2: The rest of the class.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The rest of the class.
Speaker 2: This girl came in the class, my teacher was there, of course, but then this other girl came, this upper class girl with a hand full of pennies.  I found out later there was one in every lower class, every other classroom, they would read the question over the loud speaker and you raise your hand.  I answered more questions than anybody else in there.  I wound up with a hand full of pennies.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) So she was distributing the pennies?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good, that's good. So, what do you attribute to your acumen at that age--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I don't know, I just think our parents--I don't know.
Speaker 1: Did you watch television a lot growing up or listen to the radio? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Well I mean we watched normal TV like most kids.  My father always had the news on; you heard the news in the evening.  I was in first grade.
Speaker 1: Did you read the paper in the first grade?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't read the paper in the first grade.  We used to have weekly readers in school this was first grade.  (You had?) weekly readers in school.  We couldn't-- we didn't even know how to read in first grade, we were just learning how to read.  I just remember, I just remember that day.
Speaker 1: Now was there, was there, were you privy to political discussion, I mean, discussion of current events around the house or--?
Speaker 2: No we didn't talk about--not with children back then. I'm sure the adults did.  But we didn't get into political discussions or anything.  We ate dinner together as a family pretty much every night and we would talk about school.  My father [Alston James Scott] would ask, "What did you do in school? What did you do in this class? What did you do in that class?"
Speaker 1: So you were retentive enough to know the answers to these things even though you weren't necessarily that interested.
Speaker 2: I think so. That's right. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Again, I was in first grade. (laugh).
Story_ID: 27802
Speaker 1: So if you weren't aware of Sputnik [first manmade satellite of Earth] were you aware-- when did you become in grade school aware of the space program?
Speaker 2: Not until third grade.  Third grade was, was when I became aware of the space program.  And the first-- our librarian-- I think it was the third grade-- actually took us to the public library to get library cards.  She actually put us in her car myself and several other students and drove us to the public library.  We filled out the information to get library cards and the first book to get checked out was called 'Project Mercury.'  Don't even know exactly why I check it out.  But obviously it was in the early days in preparing for the original Mercury space flights.  So I read that book and wrote a book report on 'Project Mercury,' I was in third grade.  So that was the first time I can remember being exposed to the space program and then after that--.
Speaker 1: Well, were you one of the kids that would know the names of all seven astronauts?
Speaker 2: I probably did then, I have to think-- it's a shame, I'll have to go think back.
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) That was the first seven. I remember in second grade we knew the names, I mean--.
Speaker 2: Well, at the time I read 'Project Mercury' they hadn't even selected the original seven this was just about the project itself.  They were just going through the process, I guess, of designing and preparing for the program because the actual first launches didn't occur until later on.  I think I was in fifth grade, I believe, when the first launches occurred when they sent up Alan Shepard '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) '60 [1960]--I think Shepard went up in '59 [1959] I think.  Shephard, and then Glenn in--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And then John Glenn and-- but anyway that didn't occur until later after my third grade, later on, and my teacher at that time was Mr. Clark, Franklin Clark at Tucker Elementary [Miami, Florida].  Now, Franklin Clark was a very influential, instrumental teacher my life.
Speaker 1: Alright, so Tucker Elementary, you started going there when you were in--?
Speaker 2: In fifth and sixth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Mr. Franklin Clark-
Speaker 2: Franklin Clark. And he's still in Miami, still-- (is retired?).
Speaker 1: Now this is an African American gentleman, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  Tucker was all black also Carver Elementary and Francis Tucker were all black schools, they were segregated.
Speaker 1: The teachers were all black too?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, teachers, principals, administrators everybody all black.
Speaker 1: This is slightly different model, I'm asking because in the north we had schools with black populations but you had like white teachers or a mixed group of teachers. But you didn't--
Speaker 2: No, it was all black, everybody.  But anyway Mr. Clark was very big on not just regular academic curriculum but current events.  And Mr. Clark would bring in newspapers about current events, particularly the space program.  He would talk about 'Project Mercury' and the astronauts and who had been selected and getting ready to fly into space.  I can remember when Alan Shepard's first flight occurred, we read about it in the newspaper, we actually brought newspapers into the classroom and we read it in class and talked about it in class, what that was all about and it was very interesting and fascinating to me at that time, to be honest.  But I never thought about doing it, never thought seriously about pursuing it.  It was just something we were doing in school that was very interesting.
Speaker 1: Now, you and I are about the same age and I remember what a big to do was made of Alan Shepard going into space and how you only had three or four stations on television-
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and those were all devoted, all three networks were devoted-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --all morning leading up to the launch-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --after the launch, that night-
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --talked about nothing but Alan Shepard.
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember, I remember.  But we didn't have TVs in school, so during the school day we read the newspapers about it read articles and then at night I can remember watching TV and, like you say we only had three or four stations, and I can remember watching the simulations on TV.  I remember one simulation in particular had Alan Shepard's capsule, a simulation of the capsule, and it showed how he could use the maneuvering just to maneuver the capsule in oaring in different directions, I remember that scene.  So yeah I remember those.
Speaker 1: In my school they actually wheeled in a television set.  (Everybody watched it?). It was a big--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: It was, it was a big deal, as well it should be, it's a history making event.
Speaker 1: Now this being in Florida, you know, I just wonder if it was a bigger event here because Cape Canaveral [Florida] is here, I don't know.
Speaker 2: I supposed it was but again in my little corner of the world, the all black section of Coconut Grove, we talked about it in school as Mr. Clark made it a big event for us.  So from my perspective it was a big event, I suspect it was a big event all over.  Probably, especially in this, this location. But remember when I grew up, you know, Cape Canaveral from my neighborhood might as well as been a thousand miles.  Nowadays it is no big deal, in fact, when I flew they brought up students from my elementary school to watch my space flight. Well, when I grew up there we co-we didn't take a trip up here.  That was, that's like--might as well have been in Australia or someplace.
Story_ID: 27803
Speaker 1: What did you like the most in school, I mean, what subject matter?
Speaker 2: Science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I enjoyed science the most.  I always liked experiments having to do with electricity.  I liked batteries, and lights and motors and, and things like that.  I enjoyed all science; that was my favorite subject in school.
Speaker 1: So, did you start having science classes in grade school?
Speaker 2: Yes, we had science classes in grade school.  We also would have science fairs at the school where you could build little projects and bring them in and put them on display.  And I can remember one time building a crystal radio set out of one of the magazines and I think I cut a broom handle up as a (unclear) and wound the wire around, a coil around the wire and I had what is called a cat tail whisker and a couple of capacitors and tried to build a crystal radio.
Speaker 1: Now what, what is that, I have heard that before and I heard people that were raised in the 1930s that actually built the crystal radio set with a few simple parts?
Speaker 2: Just a few simple parts.
Speaker 1: So you need a what, what do you need--?
Speaker 2: It was a very simple form of broadcast radio and the crystal was really a diode, that's a device that allows currents to pass in only one direction or other.  So you could build the coil--by changing the length of the coil you could differentiate between the frequencies that came in through the antenna.  So the antenna would feed the coil and you separate out whatever frequency you want, then you could demodulate that frequency with what's called a crystal dial or an old fashioned name is called a cat tail whisker.  I suppose because it is thin like a cat's whisker. And then you listen through a headphone because a signal is so small but you could actually hear the radio signal coming through the set.  Again you can build it with just a handful of little junk box electronic parts.  A lot of kids built, not in the black communities, but a lot of kids built crystal radios back then.  The crystal was the demodulating part, the crystal, the diode. They call it diodes these days.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but anyway. I always liked science and liked experiments, primarily those that had to do with electricity, and electronics, and motors and things that moved and lights that shin-- you turn something and it shines and telegraph sets.  I remember once building a teleg-a Morse code telegraph set using door bells, the battery and just a household door bell and switch.  I made a switch and hooked up a door bell to it and you can make the dots and dashes using the door bell and the battery and then tried to learn Morse code on my own.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, so this is, this is good.
Speaker 2: I liked airplanes also. Built plastic model airplanes.  My brother [Alston James Scott Jr.] and I would save our money and buy plastic model airplane kits and glue and put those together.  And I would build airplanes out of wood, I couldn't afford a lot of fancy airplane kits like the fancy balsa kits and, and radio controlled and stuff like that that the affluent kids had.  But I can remember using scrap wood to build model airplanes and try and fly them.  Every once and awhile I might get one that fly-- flew real well and I might get one that didn't fly well at all.  I was always trying to build airplanes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Never thought I would be a pilot, never gave serious thought about being an airplane pilot, I just liked airplanes.  I was always trying to build airplanes, and build-- if I get a toy for Christmas and eventually the toy might tear up and I would take the motor out of it and use it to build something else.  I may put that and build a little car and put that motor on the car and try and make it work.  I was the perfect kid that should have been an engineer from day one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You wanted to see what things were made out of?
Speaker 2: I always was curious how things worked, what they were made of.  I would open things up, tear them open and see how they worked and yeah.  I had an erector set, my father [Alston James Scott] bought me an erector set once for Christmas and I built stuff out of the erector set.  It had a motor, it had batteries and all of the different parts.  You could build things out of an erector set. But, yeah, I had an erector set.
Story_ID: 27804
Speaker 1: Had your father [Alston James Scott], who was president of the PTA [Parent Teacher Association] at one time--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father--
Speaker 1: --coming to school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right. He was very, again, very big on education. Anything that helped us learn he was all for.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: My father really pushed us to get ahead.  His favorite slogan and I can hear his voice today, was, "You got to get ahead." That was his slogan.  He would say, "If the teacher tells you to read ten pages you read twenty.  If the teacher gives you ten problems you do twenty."  He would always say, "You got to get ahead," and he would have us do extra work.  I remember one time in elementary school he ordered these math worksheets, so in addition to the work we were doing in school.  He had these worksheets that we could do having to do with multiplication and addition, subtraction and again this was elementary school.  So we were getting extra practice above and beyond what we were getting in school.  He also ordered--he bought this projector, this old style film strip projector, it's old style now, back then it wasn't.  I don't know if you remember the film strips you could use. He bought this projector and then he ordered this series of, of educational tapes.  One was called--our favorite was 'Digging for Dinosaurs.'  Kids, even kids today, love dinosaurs, well, kids loved dinosaurs back then.  He bought this thing called 'Digging for Dinosaurs,' I remember it.  It had a record, this big 33-- this big LP record and so you put the record on the turntable and then you put, you put the slide strip in the projector and then the record would play and the pictures would show up on the screen.  So we watched this thing over and over and over again.  It would show a dinosaur and then the narrator would tell you, "Okay, this is the brontosaurus," and then he would tell us all about the brontosaurus and then there would be a little beep (beep sound) which means you change the slide.  So you flip to the next slide and then they say, "This is the stegosaurus and the stegosaurus lives in-" so and so and so on, then you get a beep (beep sound) then you change the slide again. (laugh)
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's a DuKane machine.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But he had the record on the record player and that's why it--(laugh).
Speaker 1: That, that, that (kind?), it's a DuKane.
Speaker 2: That's right. And-- So anyway, he-- my point is my father always did things that were fun to us but they also helped us learn.  Years later as an astronaut, I visited a museum, I think it was a museum in Atlanta someplace and the person--the curator was showing me around the museum and I was saying, "Oh yeah that's the pterodactyl, that's the brontosaurus, it actually had two brains, and that's the stegosaurus." And he said, "How do know all that?" And it flashed back to me, when I was a little kid we had this thing called 'Digging for Dinosaurs' that my father bought.  He was big on education and he was always trying to expose us to activities that were beyond the regular school year.  I remember als, once you get me talking about this stuff now, he would take us to Dinner Key Auditorium every year. Dinner Key Auditorium.
Speaker 1: Well how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: D-I-N-N-E-R, Dinner Key, K-E-Y, Auditorium and it's down on Key Biscayne [Florida], in fact, that area is there now, the auditorium and everything has changed nowadays but it's just right down--people who live in Mia-- Coconut Grove [Miami, Florida] now know where the Hard Rock Cafe is down there now and the public library is down there going down on Biscayne, I think it's Biscayne Boulevard now.  Anyway, Dinner Key Auditorium would hold different events, once a year they would hold a science fair for high school students and my father would take my brother and I to see the high school science fair projects.  There weren't any black kids that had projects in the science fair, but we would walk around and look at the things the students had built and it was so exciting and inspirational.  There were kids down there who built radio telegraph machines and built closed circuit TV and radio controlled cars, they would all kinds of biology experiments and so on and here we were this black family walking through this science fair.  So, again that was his way of exposing us to things that we didn't get inside our regular segregated community.
Speaker 1: Okay. So he-
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I guess he used the position as a postman and just, I mean, to pick up all this information, I mean, you really have to--.
Speaker 2: Well, you just read the paper.  I mean stuff is in the newspaper.  I'm surprised today at how many people don't read the newspaper and then when you tell them, "Well, I went over here and they had this event," and they say, "How did you know about that?" Well, it's in the newspaper.  A lot of things you just show up, it's free, you just show up.  Well, my father was always aware of what was going on, if there was something going on that he thought was interesting, we would go.  So, as a father, he was attempting to expose us to different events and different activities that would make us well rounded and help us educationally, help us to be successful later on in life.
Story_ID: 27805
Speaker 1: Was your father [Alston James Scott] involved in the Boy Scouts too?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was scout master for awhile.  He wasn't a scoutmaster when I was in, he was scoutmaster and then later on I became a Boy Scout.  He was on the council, on the committee that oversaw the scout troop.  But my scout master was a man by the name of Mr. Arthur Dunn.  Mr. Dunn is dead now, D-U-N-N, Arthur Dunn.  The Dunns were a prominent family in Coconut Grove; he and his brother Avery Dunn and then Arthur Dunn senior, they owned Dunn's Drugstore.  Remember, I said the community was segregated but Dunn's Drugstore was there and they had the pharmacy and the soda fountain and the whole bit. Well, Arthur Dunn was my scoutmaster in Troop 55, Troop 55 I think it's still there, still operating.  When I came back from space Troop 55 presented me with a modern Troop 55 Boy Scout shirt and so being a graduate and alum of that troop so yeah I was in the Boy Scouts and my father was a scout supporter, scout council member. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you go to camp?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, we went to camp. We would go to Boy Scout Jamboree every year and go to camp two or three times a year.  Camp Rocky Pines, I think was the name of a place we went and we used to joke there was nothing but rocks and pines out there.  We'd do hikes and we'd build camp fires and play sports at camp.  You know you had your track meets and things like that and build shelters, live in tents, maybe air rifles, you know, do some shooting.  All the normal things that Boy Scouts do, put on skits, skits were always fun in the scouts.  They would try to teach us good leadership.   And I remember there used to be a program on TV in Miami [Florida] and it was on what we use to call the educational channel but PBS [Public Broadcasting System] I guess it was.  PBS in those days was where our education channel was.  It was a weekly show about Boy Scouts, of course, remember everything was segregated, so there wouldn't be very many black scouts on, but every once and awhile they would have a black troop on.  So one week they featured my troop and I was on and our theme was navigating.  We demonstrated how to perform navigation, we had practices, we had a map and had a compass and a ruler and so on and we would label point A and point B and then we would put the compass down on the straight edge and had. So, I had to demonstrate all of that on TV while our scout master narrated along with some of the other scouts.  I hadn't thought about this in years but we had a lot of good scout activities that we were involved in.
Story_ID: 27806
Speaker 1: Now, I read that you are a black belt in karate.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you start martial arts when you were--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, I started martial arts in the Navy during my Navy career.  And I first got involved because my son wanted to take it; all little kids.  The movie 'Karate Kid' came out someone takes martial arts.  So we started taking it together and we stayed in for several years, he got to high school, dropped out went off to play football or stuff like that; I stayed with it.  I trained for a number of years and was very religious about it for many, many years.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.  And the trumpet--you started playing the trumpet.
Speaker 2: Started playing the trumpet in junior high school, seventh grade like many kids.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your junior high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to George Washington Carver Junior High School.
Speaker 1: Now this was after Tucker [Elementary School, Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: This is after Tucker; Tucker was fifth and sixth grade.  In seventh grade I went to Carver again for seven through nine.  In those days it was called junior high.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's where you took up trumpet?
Speaker 2: That's where I took up trumpet.
Speaker 1: What inspired you to play the trumpet?
Speaker 2: Actually I wasn't initially inspired at all.  In the beginning of junior high different faculty members would visit your homeroom and ask, talk about their program and ask who would like to sign up.  And the band director, Mr. Cooper came in and talked about band and asked kind of who would like to sign up for band, and I didn't raise my had.  But like I say everybody knew each other, he said, "Scott, don't you want to be in the band?" And of course, (laugh) I was taught you don't say nothing,  when an adult asks you to something that means you are supposed to go do it.  So I said yes sir but I didn't want to be in the band.  So anyway here I am; I'm signed up for band.  I show up for band class and I didn't have any instruments or anything, school was pretty poor and I didn't really care that much about it.  But shortly thereafter they had an assembly program ,they used to have assemblies back then remember this was junior senior high school.  In the assembly program the jazz band played and, man, I tell you what, they lit that place up and I was really fired up then when I heard the jazz band play.  I got really enthusiastic about playing music and playing an instrument.  Of course, trumpet for some reason appealed to me, I don't know why exactly, it just did.  So I started playing trumpet.
Speaker 1: But did your father [Alston James Scott] listen to jazz at all?
Speaker 2: No, no my father didn't listen to jazz at all, no.  My father listened only to gospel music and that's pretty much it.  Anyway the jazz band just lit something up down inside of me and I started playing trumpet and was pretty good.  My father bought a trumpet and that was a great sacrifice, that's a story in and of itself.  Buying a musical instrument, as you know, for a working family is a major investment.  So anyway, I got the trumpet and started playing.  I got good at it and started improving and just really excelled at it and enjoyed it very much.  Again, it was something that I didn't gravitate toward on my own, I got sort of pulled into it but it was something that was a natural gift to me.  Music is a gift that I have been given, that I do pretty good at it. I think I could made a living in music, might not have been famous but I could have made a living in music.

Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about church. What was the name of your family church?
Speaker 2: Family church was Macedonia Baptist Church and I believe it is the oldest African American Baptist church in Miami [Florida] if not one of the, one of the oldest churches.  It is obviously still standing there the Macedonia Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you have any roles in the church in terms of the youth?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, like I say, my father [Alston James Scott] and mother [Rubye Lee Dawson] attended church regularly.  My mother played piano and sang in the choir.  My father became a deacon, I remember when I was a little kid when he went through the training and was ordained as a deacon he was superintendant of Sunday school.  So all of the kids, my siblings and I were in church every Sunday but we also had active roles in church.  We were-- I can remember as a youngster, I guess I might have been twelve years old I was the secretary of the Sunday school.  I had to learn to take the minutes, I had to learn to read the minutes and I was the youth director of the--we used to have the BYPU, Baptist Young Peoples Youth, we used to have the BYPU in the evening, Sunday school in the morning and the BYPU in the evening and I would always act as the director, I was just a kid and I learned how to put forth a motion, learn rules of order, learn how to accept a motion or put a motion through, things like that.  So, we were being trained in business practices at the same time as we were being trained in spiritual practices.  As young kids growing up we were all participating in programs, at Christmastime there would be a Christmas program so you had to learn a speech, or you were in a play or you would give a presentation of some kind.  Even in high school my brother [Alston James Scott Jr.] played music in church, not every single Sunday but if there was a program going on my mother might play piano and my brother played saxophone and I played trumpet.  We would do a trio and we would play a musical part on the program so we were active in church and we always were in some kind of leadership position or some kind of position where you had to get up in front of people.  So I'm-- so it's never been a big deal to me to stand up in front of a crowd and give a speech or presentation, I've been doing it my whole life, because that's the way we were raised, we were brought up.  We were very comfortable in front of people, like this interview and this camera I've done this a thousand times so it's fun.
Speaker 1: You are pretty smooth at this. (laugh).
Speaker 2: (laugh).
Story_ID: 27808
Speaker 1: What about high school, now, where did you go to high school?  Now this is a desegregation story, right?
Speaker 2: Well, from seven through nine I was in junior high at Carver [George Washington Carver Junior High School] then schools integrated and I went ten through twelve [tenth through twelfth grades] at Coral Gables [High School, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: So this was in 1965?
Speaker 2: '65 [1965], '66 [1966] school year was my tenth grade year.
Speaker 1: Coral Gables High School.
Speaker 2: Coral Gables High School.
Speaker 1: Now how far was it from your home?
Speaker 2: I'd have to guess.  I bet you Coral Gables is four or five miles from home.  We walked everyday but I didn't think about it.  It was no big deal.
Speaker 1: There was no bus or anything?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have any bus, we walked.  All the black kids from the Grove we kind of meet up and then walk there together and after school we walked back.  We learned a couple of short cuts.  We cut through the freight yard, the lumber yard but I knew it was a three or four mile walk, as I think back on it.  'Cause now I am more cognitive of the distance, but back then we walked every day, no big deal.
Speaker 1: So there was no, no danger along the way or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was danger but we just--we had to cross US 1 Dixie Highway and the heavy traffic, it's a wonder that we didn't get hit.
Speaker 1: So this is, this is, okay.
Speaker 2: Heavy traffic on US 1 but we didn't think anything of it, you just, you know, you did what you had to do.  We didn't have cars obviously and there was no bus going from the Grove to the Coral Gables we walked.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Four or five miles is a pretty long walk.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it had to be, had to be four miles easily, even with shortcuts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, now you had been, I guess, aware of Civil Rights Movements growing up because so many dramatic events took place--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --'63 [1963], '64 [1964] leading up through high school; the March on Washington--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in '63 [1963], freedom-- some of the Democratic Convention of '64 [1964]--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --where the, you know, and Fannie Lou Hamer and all that.
Speaker 2: I wasn't, I wasn't as familiar with the specific names at that time as I became later.  I was more familiar with the overall Civil Rights Movement.  I can remember seeing on TV where there were sit-ins particularly at lunch counters where blacks were not allowed to sit at lunch counters and deputies would come and arrest them and beat them.  And I remember seeing on TV the fire hoses on the protesters-- demonstrators and the dogs and things like that.  And of course, I knew we all knew, Dr. Martin Luther King's name, I wasn't familiar with Ms. Fannie Lou Hammer at that time.  I became familiar with her name as I got older but at that time I was only twelve years old-
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --thirteen years old.  I knew in general what was going on, the overall civil rights movement that was going on, I was aware of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Growing up in Miami [Florida] were you subjected to any of the overt like racism like signs and that sort of thing, like white fountains, black fountains?
Speaker 2: Very little because we pretty much stayed in our own community.  Now I can remember when I was at Carver in junior high my brother [Alston James Scott Jr.] went down to Ponce De Leon Junior High School and it was a lot of overt racism down there.  I wasn't even there but my father [Alston James Scott] took a picture of it.  Somebody had spray painted the wood "nigger" on the fence outside of the school and things like that.  My brother went down to Ponce for a year or two then things just got so that we brought him back up to Carver junior high school then he later went to Coral Gables.  But I wasn't subjected so much to overt racism because everything we had was really pretty much in our own community.  By the time I reached senior high school things had pretty much opened up.  I can remember going downtown and eating at Woolworth's restaurant.  You could go in and get a hamburger and sit down and eat or going into Howard Johnson and getting a hamburger.  So things had pretty much opened up by then and I can remember--remember I told you in third grade when I went down to get a library card at the public library, I didn't have any trouble.  That was obviously down in the white community.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Some cities you couldn't do that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right, in some cities you couldn't.  But, no, I had no problem, in fact from then on I would ride my bike to the library.  People were just as nice and gave me what I wanted they--I really didn't experience any overt racism growing up as a child in Miami. It's interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay. Glad I asked that question.  So at Coral Cable High School did they integrate the teaching staff there or was--?
Speaker 2: Yes they integrated the teaching staff also some of the teachers from Carver came over from Coral Gables also.  A couple of coaches, black coaches came over, assistant principals came over, Ms. Silver, Vernitha Silver came over, I think Mr. Bentley, Mr. Roy Bentley was one of our counselors, Mr. Simms, Mr. Bob Simms [Robert Simms] came over from Carver.  So the faculty at Coral Gables became integrated also.  I don't think you had much of the reverse immediately, eventually you did have a few white teachers go over to Carver, so that did happen too.  So, yeah, some of the black counselors came over to the Gables.  The integration process was really very smooth; we didn't have-- there were no riots and fights or anything.  We rolled right in there and were treated pretty well, I don't know what people were thinking but the way they treated us was fine.  Because we came over and we started playing sports and I was in the band and other kid were in the chorus and drama and-- we really didn't have any incidents at the Gables.
Speaker 1: There was really a dramatic difference the ten years made because ten years before in Norfolk [Virginia] and other places was horrible but that ten years makes a real difference.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 27809
Speaker 1: Were you involved in sports at all?
Speaker 2: I only played junior varsity basketball is all.  I wasn't a varsity player. My main activity was band.  I was over in the Coral Gables marching band; in fact Coral Gables [High School, Miami, Florida] was such a big school actually had two bands.  The top band or the number one band was one of the finest marching bands in the country based on the awards they had won.  The legendary band director was a guy named Bill Ledue [William Ledue] and Bill is in the band masters hall of fame, the late Bill Ledue now.  But it was an outstanding marching band.  And I was the only black student in the band, the marching-- the top marching band.  We had a handful in the junior bands so to speak; the Coral Gables High School band of distinction.
Speaker 1: So were you the top trumpet player?
Speaker 2: I was--not in my first year there but when I finished up I was section--lead trumpet and section leader at Coral Gables.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a lead trumpet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said music of the day was James Brown, The Funk--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: For the black schools now when I went to Coral Gables it was different.  It was the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, whoever else, Petula Clark and Frank Sinatra, it was predominantly--but you also did concert music.  You had your concert series.  We didn't have a jazz program at Gables but I played jazz on the side down in the black community. So I got my jazz.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did you-- did, did you and your friends get together and form a jazz band?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah well from day one again remember when I was in seventh grade I heard the jazz band play but as I continued the next two years up at Carver we continued to learn to play jazz and rock and rhythm blues and so on.  So even when I went to Coral Gables as a student I lived in the black community. So I still played jazz, I played rock, I played rhythm and blues so I had both sides of the music community.  I had the concert music with heavy quality concert music and then I had the good quality jazz and R&B and stuff in the black community.
Speaker 1: Now Miami [Florida] is a music mecca in the sense of a lot of entertainers come here.  Entertainment goes on in Miami and a lot of the big name people come here.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I am trying to get my bearings was the Lyric Theater like open then or had that passed?
Speaker 2: I don't remember the Lyric Theater but down in where I grew up in Coconut Grove some of the big-- one of the biggest was Sir John Night Beat.  That was a big one and Sir John used to get all of the big names.  They use to get Aretha Franklin and so on. In fact, when I grew up as a young teenager I got to play behind some of the big names of the day like a guy named Carl Henderson, Solomon Burke was a big name, Betty Wright, Betty Wright won a grammy in '72 [1972].  I played behind Betty Wright, the Drifters, Tyrone Davis and I am trying to think who else.
Speaker 1: You got a chance to actually play behind them? (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I played behind them.  I was just a kid but I was good like I said when I took off in music it took off.  But I wasn't the only one I mean the block of kids are really good white and black.  But in the black community as you know this music is such a big part of the community.  You have a lot of really fine musicians coming up as youngsters, so it was not unusual for some of us to really excel and we get a chance to play behind some of these, these people.  So, in fact, my band director would allow us--the black band directors would jam at night, would gig at night.  So they would let us come in and sit with them and that's how we learned how to play.  You sit with them in the evening, so I'd be fourteen and I might be sitting beside a thirty-five, forty-year old man and you're learning how to play music.  And so, anyway, when some of these people came to town if they needed a trumpet player, you know, the band director may come and ask me if I could. Of course I would say ask my dad if I go play and he would say, "Yeah, go play."  I got to play behind all these people, a lot of named people of the day.  A guy by the name of Little Beaver, people don't know Little Beaver's name but they know Little Beaver's playing because he did a lot of guitar licks for Kool and the Gang.  A lot of the stuff that you heard on the recordings was this guy name dGene Harrison, we called him Little Beaver but Frank Williams and Rock A Tears at Sir John Night Beat was one of the big clubs in Miami--black clubs.  Before a lot of the black clubs closed up when integration came about and blacks began to be welcomed down on Miami Beach.  So we started going down to Miami Beach and all the big names would go down there.  A lot of the small black clubs kind of folded, went along the wayside.
Speaker 1: A sad story all over the country.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Hampton House was another lounge--Hampton House was a nice jazz lounge where we could go in and learn to play.  We'd sit in a little bit and learn to play music.  We were listening to people jazz-wise was Cannonball Adderly Quintet back then, Ramsey Lewis.
Speaker 1: Now Cannonball Adderly is from Florida isn't he?
Speaker 2: Tallahassee.
Speaker 1: Tallahassee, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: He and his brother Nat.
Speaker 2: That's right, FAMU [Florida A&M University].  Yeah, but we grew up listening to Cannonball Adderly and Nat Adderly and also Ramsey Lewis and Lee Morgan, Art Blakely and the Jazz Messengers.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Art Blakely, yeah, he's a legend.
Speaker 2: Legend.
Speaker 1: Is Art Blakely from around here?
Speaker 2: I have, I have no idea.
Speaker 1: Okay, but he would come to town?
Speaker 2: No I'm talking about records.  We would listen to those records.  Yeah, that's, those are people we learned to play by listening to.  I didn't get to play with those people, I didn't get to play with Cannonball for example, no, no, no wish I had but--.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you are getting a rich musical--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Got a rich musical education.
Story_ID: 27810
Speaker 1: Now, were you still involved in science in high school, I would imagine.
Speaker 2: Not as much as I would liked to because there wasn't any guidance or inspiration.  There was no one to mentor me along in science.  I was very good at it, I was good at math, I always had a good math aptitude but no, no I didn't stick with it.
Speaker 1: So you had no mentor in science at, at Coral Gables?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I always thought I would like to go to school and study something having to do with science but I didn't know what it was.  Nobody, I didn't get no guidance, I didn't know what engineering was we didn't have any engineers, our only engineer drove a train.  I didn't know, didn't know what engineering was, so.  Music was what I was really good at.  I really liked it and so I began to concentrate on music and wound up going to college to study music. And Bill [William] Ledue, my band director that I told you about was instrumental there in getting me into Florida State University School of Music [Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were your grades like in high school?
Speaker 2: I was probably a B, C student.  Yeah, and I probably didn't work up to my potential.  I was a B, C student, I guess, without trying.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were playing music and you were you know--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Just playing music and getting by in my grades.  I was doing pretty well, but not nearly up to what I could have done had I concentrated and focused on it.
Speaker 1: And there was nobody that really emerged and recognized the talent you had in science?
Speaker 2: No, not in science and math.  They recognized the talent I had in music.  So everybody figured, "Well, okay he's going to be a musician, (unclear) let's go do that."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So as a senior Mr. Ledue helped you get in to Florida State?
Speaker 2: Yes.  An interesting story and Mr. Ledue urged me to apply to Florida State University.  I had already applied to a few other schools.  But Florida State University was and still is one of the finest schools of music in the country.  It is an outstanding school of music.  So anyway, I applied at Florida State University and I did not get accepted.  And I was kind of ashamed and afraid to tell Mr. Ledue that I was not accepted.  But he kept asking me, he asked every week or so, "Have you heard from Florida State?" And I lied, I said, "No, I haven't heard from them yet."  But really I had gotten this letter of rejection.  So finally I had to break down and tell him, I said, "Yes, I heard from them but I was not accepted." And he said, "Okay. Well, come on into my office."  He said, "How are you doing in school?" He said, "How are your grades, are you still a B student?"  I said, "Yes sir, I am still a B student." I was really probably B, C, well B student, okay.  So he said, "Come on into my office." And he took me into his office and he said wait here.  I waited in the outer foyer, he went into the inner office and closed the door.  There was a glass on that so I could see through it but I couldn't hear what was going on.  He picked up the telephone, made a phone call. I could see him nodding and talking, put the phone down and he said, "Okay, you can go to class."  I went to class and about three days later I received a letter saying, "You are accepted to Florida State University."  That was amazing to me. Anyway, I show up at Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida] the next fall, enrolled in the School of Music, made the dean's list in my first semester there and continued to do well the whole way.  Well, my point is he made the phone call that got me into Florida State.  Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida] exposed me to a lot of things.  Because in addition to taking my music courses I sort of discovered what engineering was.  My roommate was an engineering major and I began taking math and science and physics and engineering as an overload.  I was taking eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one hours a quarter, we were on the quarter system then.  Because I was taking calculus in addition to music theory and--.
Speaker 1: You graduated from high school in '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: '68 [1968] that's right.  And so Florida State exposed me to engineering courses and science and all and so I began to take both music and engineering because he made that phone call.  Had he not made the phone call I probably would not have gone to Florida State; I would not have been exposed to engineering; I would not have become a pilot; I would not have become an astronaut probably.
Speaker 1: What was the highest level of math that you had in--?
Speaker 2: In college?
Speaker 1: Coral Gables.
Speaker 2: I guess Algebra II they called it, I guess advanced algebra, that's all.
Story_ID: 27811
Speaker 1: Well I start, my first class at Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida] as a freshman, I'm trying to think, I think I exempted the algebra, I didn't have to take it.  But then when I got, I sort of discovered, there's a lot more to this, when I sort of discovered engineering I began to take math on its own.  So I went back and I took linear algebra and then I took Buling algebra and I took analytic trigonometry, analytic geometry, and then I took all the calculus.  I just did that on my own.  I did pretty good.  I had a pretty good math aptitude. And then I took physics and then I was taking electronics all in addition to music theory.  I wasn't taking just the basic music courses either I was taking composition, that's that theory.  As a freshman I exempted the whole first year of music theory, I went right into sophomore theory at Florida State.
Speaker 2: So you were ahead of the game.
Speaker 1: I was ahead of the game; I was a freshman taking sophomore courses.
Speaker 2: Alright, now, in terms of engineering-- math and engineering did you have like a mentor at Florida State, someone that--?
Speaker 1: No, I just did it on my own.
Speaker 2: Just your association with your roommate got you involved--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: That got me started and I just started doing it and if I needed help I could get help.  I could get help from the instructors and all but I also had help from other people.  I can remember when I was taking calculus. I remember taking a calculus course, I can't remember if it was integration, but anyway it was advance calculus and I didn't quite understand it so Emmett Smith-- Emmett Smith, Emmett Stevens, Emmett Smith was a football player, Emmett Stevens was a black student. Remember, we were a small number of African Americans at Florida State so everybody kind of knew each other.  Emmett was ahead of me, Emmett was a senior majoring in math.  So I got, I used to get together with Emmett and Emmett would help me with my calculus.  I worked at the radio station my senior year in college and I would get off from work at eleven.  I was on from nine to eleven and I would get together with Emmett between eleven and midnight and Emmett would help me with calculus.  I hadn't thought about that in a long time and I don't know what became of Emmett.  But, so, the help, we, you know, we all kind of helped each other because Emmett was a math major he helped me with calculus.
Speaker 2: Now were you involved in any social activities, you know, like fraternities?
Speaker 1: I was not in a fraternity in undergraduate, see I only-w,ell, I pledged fraternity after college.  Again, Florida State was newly integrated and we had one African American fraternity on campus.  I did not pledge that one I pledged a different fraternity later on.  Well I mean I had the normal social activities, you know, growing up I wasn't just a nerdy kid who did nothing.  Oh, I had plenty of activities and dances and parties.  I was popular. I always had plenty of girlfriends, being a musician.  Girls like the band so I always had plenty of girlfriends and plenty of guy friends and played a lot of sports.  I wasn't a varsity athlete but I played a lot of basketball in high school.  You know, we had good senior league teams out of the boys club and I played a lot of basketball and just junior varsity in high school.  And the same thing in college, I was a musician so I was in bands.  I was playing all over the place and we had our regular parties and get-togethers in, in school.  Quite often I was on stage performing so I was always a pretty popular person; I always had a good social life.
Speaker 2: Okay. Okay.  So this is a rigorous agenda you put forth for yourself with the higher math and all that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see I enjoyed it.  So when you enjoy something it's not really work.  I mean, it's a lot of study and it was rigorous but I enjoyed calculus to me it was fun.
Story_ID: 27812
Speaker 1: Now, did you take, I guess, were you in the Navy or ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] or something?
Speaker 2: Nope, no ROTC.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Towards the end of my college career I began to think about what I wanted to do when I graduated.  And I really wanted to, again here we go, I had no guidance, no mentoring it was me kind of doing it on my own.  I was getting ready to graduate in a year or so, going into my senior and I was thinking I love music but I really don't want to teach music and I really-- I was gravitating more toward the science and engineering again.  Florida State closed the engineering school, just closed it down, that's right so I couldn't finish my engineering degree. I finished my music degree.  Students who were in engineering either had to change their major or change schools. They closed it down for some reason, we were undergrads and we didn't know why.  So I said to myself, "I got to get out of this school, I don't have money to stay in."  So I finished my music degree but I kept saying to myself, "I want to-- really want to finish my engineering so how can I go about doing that?" And then I reasoned that the military, I heard, would send people to school if you join the military.  Maybe that's an option.  So I started to look into the various military branches of the service and again Vietnam was going on and that wasn't real popular.  But something just kept pushing me in that direction.  So I talked to the Air Force and the Marines and so on.  And upon graduation I was thinking that I might go into the military. I had a cousin who was in the Air Force.  He had been enlisted and the Air Force had sent him to college so I talked to him briefly and he said, "Well, if you are going to the military be sure you go in as an officer, since you have the college degree. So go in as an officer."  So that bit of advice-- I had no guidance I just drove around to different recruiting stations.  So I thought, "Okay, I will try the military maybe they will send me to college to study engineering, even though I had a bachelor's degree already in music."  I said, "As long as I am going to go in I have to do some kind of specialty, I like to fly air-- I might like to fly airplanes."  I had never flown an airplane in my life, had been on an airplane maybe twice in my life.  So that's why I went down to the Air Force recruiters, because naturally if you think about airplanes (laugh), the first place you think about is the Air Force.  So I went down to the Air Force recruiter's office, took a little test and they sent my name in, so we were waiting and it was taking the Air Force so long to respond that it dawned on me, I said, "Yeah the Navy has airplanes."  I said, "Those Navy guys must be good because operate off ships." And so I got into my car and drove to the Navy recruiting station down in south Miami [Florida].  "Tell me about the flight program," they gave me the battery of tests.  I did real well on the test because I had taken calculus and physics and all that in school.  Sent my name in, so I am waiting on the Air Force and I am waiting on the Navy.  Well, the Navy wines and dines myself and the others who took the test.  They take us to the Naval Air Station and spend the night and we go to Oak Club and take us out to steak dinners.  The Navy brought airplanes into Miami and took us on flights while we were there.  I said, "Man, these Navy guys are something."  I got the response back, the Navy said, "You are hereby accepted into Aviation Officer Candidate School [Pensacola, Florida]." I still hadn't heard from the Air Force yet.  So I said, "Sign me up." a couple of months later I'm off to Pensacola [Florida] for Navy flight training.
Story_ID: 27813
Speaker 1: So this is still-
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971], '72 [1972], there about.
Speaker 1: Seventy-one [1971], '72 [1972]. And, accepted into the Navy, the officer's candidate-- (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Naval Aviation Officer Candidate School, AOCS that's right.  It's where potential pilots would go.  If people ever saw that movie called 'An Officer and a Gentleman' with Richard Gere, that movie was sort of a replication of Aviation Officer Candidate School.  If you ever see you will see that movie--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: I've seen it, I've seen it.
Speaker 2: Yeah that movie-
Speaker 1: Richard Gere--
Speaker 2: --and Lou Gossett, that's right.
Speaker 1: He is the sergeant major.
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely.  Anyway I was accepted in Aviation Officer Candidate School and because the future was so unknown or uncertain, the Navy had a reputation of being very conservative and that's putting it lightly. I didn't even tell my parents that I was going to flight training.  I just told them I am going to the Navy to be an officer.  But I found out later they thought I had lost my mind.  But at the time they were always encouraging no matter what you do, they were supportive and encouraging.  So off I went to Pensacola [Florida]. And--
Speaker 1: Okay. So to Pensacola, that is where you were trained?
Speaker 2: That's where all Navy pilots start in Pensacola, the cradle of Naval Aviation as they call it.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.  So were there other African American candidates?
Speaker 2: Yeah there were a hand full.  There was only one other African American candidate in my class and he dropped out the flight training.
Speaker 1: That's out of how many total, roughly?
Speaker 2: Well, the dropout, wash out rate was about 50 percent back then.
Speaker 1: How many students were there all together?
Speaker 2: They took a class every week remember the war was still going on--the tail end of Vietnam so they would take maybe twenty students per week and they finished up maybe half that at the end of the year and a half later.  When you got your wings, fifty percent or more had washed out or dropped out.  In my class we started with twelve, three of us got wings.  So we had a higher wash out or dropout rate.  There was only one other African American in my class and he dropped out of flight training.  So, it's a very rigorous for everybody not just African Americans, I mean, white kids dropped out or washed out too.
Speaker 1: It's easier to say you are going to be one than actually do it?
Speaker 2: Well we had a very high dropout wash out rate and a lot of it had to do with swimming.  A lot of African Americans come, could not swim and I was one of them.  I was a sub or remedial swimmer.  Swimming environment is heavy in the Navy.
Speaker 1: Even after being in the Boy Scouts [of America]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we didn't have swimming pools. We didn't have a swimming pool until later on in my formative years and then there were so many people splashing around the pool you didn't really learn how to swim.  In fact, today it's still--I bet you find a high rate of non-swimmers in the African American community.
Speaker 1: Well, you are absolutely right.  I know they talk about it during the last Olympic games.  There were so few swimmers and the reason why is because we don't have any pools and no opportunities to swim.
Speaker 2: That's right.  And the communities that do have municipal pools are a recreational place the pool is jammed packed in the summertime people splashing around and you didn't take swimming seriously.  But anyway, a lot of our African Americans wash out because of swim. A lot of them wash out because of academics, the lack of engineering or mechanical training and then just the rigors of military flight training wash a lot of people out.  A lot of people think they want to be a military pilot because they see on TV on movies but when you gain the reality of it, it is, it is not like you see on TV.  The rewards are tremendous if you make it but it's not all fun and games the way it looks on TV.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, is there any particular instructors or officers in the Navy that, you know, helped you out?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say that for the most part everybody was pretty fair.  People that did things that were unfair, there were other people who would come along and say that's not fair, do it the right way. So--
Speaker 1: So it was a balance?
Speaker 2: That's right.  If you had-- If you worked hard and you had the discipline and you had the skills to get by then you would get the help you need.  I could point out a few specific individuals but overall the system was an incredibly rigorous and competitive, people don't know what competition is until they get into the military, especially Navy flight training.  But the rewards are great and if you stick with it and you work hard typically people had good instructors.  But I was a pretty good student also.
Story_ID: 27814
Speaker 1: How long did it take for you to be, you know, fully trained?
Speaker 2: Well I started in May of '73 [1973] and got my wings in August of '74 [1974], that's typical, so a year to a year and a half.  From day one-- you start from the time you earn your wings, your Navy wings.  Again I was tailing Vietnam so they were, they were training us as though we were going to go to Vietnam.  We, we knew things were winding down, (unclear) POWs [prisoners of war] were brought home and so we figured we weren't going anywhere.  But the pace was rigorous, the pace in the aviation is rigorous anyway. But--
Speaker 1: So they were evacuating Saigon [Vietnam] in '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So anyway that must have been a relief on someone.
Speaker 2: Well, when you are young like that you want to go where the action is so to speak.  If you are going to do it let's go do it right.  At the same time there were all the protests against the war going on over here so you had this mixed feelings.  A bunch of us were going in to do something that was so unpopular out in the larger community, so that was kind of an interesting time.  But I didn't pay any attention, I kind of knew what I was supposed to do.  I felt like I was in the right place and doing the right thing.  I really did, it's hard to explain that but I just knew down in here that what I was doing was right for me.  Obviously, in hindsight it was right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what happened when you finished training?
Speaker 2: Well I finished training and I got assigned to my first squadron.
Speaker 1: Maybe I should-- I'm going to fast because what was-- was there a hardest part of training?  What was the hardest part of training for you?
Speaker 2: The hardest part probably-- I don't consider any of it real hard, it was all difficult but it was also rewarding, it was challenging.  Everything was challenging, the physical part, the military part, the academics, the real heavy academics.  That's before you ever get to an airplane.  You have three or four months of just basic officer training before you ever see an airplane.  The swimming probably was the biggest obstacle to overcome but, because I was on remedial swim for awhile, but I overcame that.  Swimming requirements are pretty heavy.  You had to demonstrate a hundred yards using four different strokes for example.  You had to swim a mile fully clothed with all your flight gear on at the end.  You tread water for thirty minutes, one minute with no hands, ten minutes with what they called drown proofing.  You had the underwater swim tower jump ,there's whole lot of serious swimming requirements for Navy pilots.  I remember the day my class, again two blacks in class, the day we first went to the swimming pool they just wanted to see what you could do.  Myself, another one of the other candidates we couldn't pass any of the swim tests; none at all (laugh).  It's funny now but it wasn't funny then.  There was one guy in the class, this dude jumped in the water, swam a mile the first day, it turns out he had been a college varsity swimmer.  So here we are, we couldn't pass anything so we were on remedial swim.  So it was all very challenging but I overcame everything.  Probably the biggest challenge was the swimming.
Speaker 1: Now what aircraft did you train on?
Speaker 2: Well, you start-- we started out in those days in what's called a T34.  It was a single engine propeller driven airplane.  Two places, instructing yourself. Then I went to a larger airplane the T28 it's kind of like a World War II airplane.  It's a huge radioing and combat airplane.  Then I was selected for helicopter training, so I went to fly the H57 Jet Ranger and then the H1 Hughie.  The Hughie was used extensively in Vietnam as a gun ship.  So my first squadron, after I got my wings, you go to an operational a real Navy squadron, was flying anti submarine warfare helicopters off of destroyers so I did that for three years.  Then the Navy sent me to graduate school to get my engineering degree.  Then I went to jet training and would fly fighters, I flew F14s.
Story_ID: 27815
Speaker 1: What year did you start flying jets?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, I flew helicopters from '74 [1974] thru '78 [1978], graduate school from '78 [1978] to '80 [1980], then jet training during 1980 and then fighters from then on; the rest of my career.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So graduate school you got a graduate degree in--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Aeronautical engineering.
Speaker 1: Aeronautical engineering and where was that from?
Speaker 2: The U.S. Naval Post Graduate School.  It's the graduate arm of the Navy-- U.S. Naval Academy. That's in Monterey, California.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So alright. So. Now when you--you started flying jets with--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: In 1980 and I flew the T84 first which is jet trainer, you know obviously I had to be trained in jets.  I had my fix wing. Navy trains everybody in fix wing airplanes.  Remember I flew the T34 and T28 then went to helicopters.  So I had both (unclear), so I had to get jet trained so I flew the T84.  The 84 is a combat airplane used in Vietnam.  The T84 is the trainer version of it.  So you have a seat for an instructor and you up front.  So I did my jet training in the T84, then I got assigned to a F14 fighter squadron.  A F14 people don't know it's the one that Tom Cruise character flew in the movie 'Top Gun,' that's the airplane that character was flying.
Speaker 1: It's the F14, 14 made famous by Tom Cruise.
Speaker 2: Yeah that's right.
Speaker 1: 'Top Gun.'
Speaker 2: In 'Top Gun.'  So I flew the F14 for about five years as an operational pilot--operational fighter pilot. That means you-- you can be assigned to combat. Then I became--I was selected for a program called Aerospace Engineering Duty Officer, it's AEDO, so I was getting into a sub specialty.  Now I'm starting to get into research development testing evaluation end of flying.  So, and so, anyway, as an AEDO aerospace engineering officer I continued to fly, test fly different airplanes, I flew a lot of different airplanes, but I was also involved in engineering.  I had several assignments as an aerospace engineering officer.  I flew several airplanes, I flew the F14 again, I flew the A-7 Corsair, the FA18 and so it was as an AEDO that I was selected by NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for astronaut training.
Speaker 1: So this is-now what year are we now?
Speaker 2: I became an aerospace engineering officer in 1985 and my first AEDO assignment was between '85 [1985] and '88 [1988] and that was the Naval Aviation Depot in Jacksonville, Florida. I was a test pilot up there and the director of the engineering department.  Then between '88 [1988] and '92 [1992] I was in a place called Warminster, Pennsylvania.  It was the naval air warfare center, aircraft division.  They have all these long names; it was a research development facility.  So I was a test pilot up there and deputy director of the tactical aircrafts systems department, it was a whole lot, it's a lot of stuff. So that's where I was stationed in '92 [1992] when I was selected by NASA for astronaut training.
Speaker 1: Okay, so we have covered a lot of ground fast here.
Speaker 2: There's obviously a lot more detail too that I've left out.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.  So are there any outstanding individuals or incidents that take place during this time?
Speaker 2: Well I can think of a lot of outstanding individuals along my career.  If I want to start Navy, I think my first commanding officers in my helicopter squadron were, were very good mentors.  And I can name those and also during jet training I can think of a couple of instructors that were real good.  So there are a number of people along the way, I can think of also a couple of--a few of the African American pilots in the Navy who were good peers and mentors.  There weren't very many of us, everybody knew everybody.  If you are an active duty black Navy pilot, you either knew of the person or you knew them personally.  So, yeah, Buddy Penn [B.J. Penn], Dick Williams--Captain Dick Williams [Captain Richard Williams] are just some of the names that come to mind who were my--.  They were a little older than me, who were mentors, so yeah there were some definitely.
Speaker 1: And, you know, did you see the--did the Navy, like, change in any way from the time that you started to, to the point where you were selected--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, the Navy continued to change and the Navy was again very conservative branch of the service when I came.  It had the reputation of being very conservative, you know, the last to integrate and so on.  And it was also-- there were no women serving in operational units; women could serve ashore but there no women serving on the ships.  But that changed, the women integrated, the number of African Americans coming into the Navy coming into the Navy also increased unfortunately the number of aviators still has not increased.  I bet you the number of black aviators on active now is probably not much more percentage wise than it was when I was active and that's unfortunate.  My son is on active duty in the Navy right now, he is a fighter pilot and Naval Academy graduate.  And so the Navy does continue to change and the Navy continues to open up and embrace--if you want to get on that subject what we need to do, is we need to see more African Americans apply and more African American qualifying.  We don't have as many going into, into this type of thing as, as we need to see.
Story_ID: 27816
Speaker 1: Had you been following the astronaut program?
Speaker 2: Yes, I, I began to follow it during my active duty Navy days.  It was an interesting program, fascinating to me and in the back of mind I always thought, "Yeah I would like to do that."  I didn't think seriously that it would happen but it was always there in the back of my mind.  I watched it and followed and certainly thought it would be a wonderful program to be a part of. Yep.
Speaker 1: I think it was in '83 [1983] that Guion Bluford became the first--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right I remember when Guy Bluford.
Speaker 1: Guy Bluford.
Speaker 2: Guion, but we called him Guy.  I remember when Guy was selected, I remember reading about it.  And, let's see, Guy was selected along with Fred Gregory and Ron McNair.  It, it was Guy, Fred and Ron McNair selected at the same time, the first three.  I remember that, I remember reading about it and also at that time I was getting ready to go--I was in grad school and I remember writing 'Ebony Magazine' to get in touch with Colonel Gregory and they wrote back and they wouldn't give me his information but they contacted me.  And Fred Gregory actually called me on the telephone and talked with me that was really exciting that he would take time out to do that.  Then I met Guy Bluford some years later, we appeared on a program together, I was a Navy pilot, Navy test pilot and he was on the program and I was too. So I got to meet him real quick.  That's was before I applied for the space program.  I remember when General Bolden, Charlie Bolden was selected and again I was in grad school at that point getting ready to finish up grad school.  And then some number of, of years later it was my turn to apply.  But yeah, I followed the program then.
Speaker 1: There's a history going back to I guess 1961 or so when Ed Wright [Edward Wright] was selected-
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but he really, they washed him out--he had a hard-
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --time, very hard time, FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigations] surveillance, a lot of crazy stuff.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then Robert Lawrence loses his life in a--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I know of Bob Lawrence, of course, never met him (unclear), he had an accident.
Speaker 1: Before he even started taking astronaut training.
Speaker 2: That's right. Right.
Speaker 1: So this group with Fred Gregory and Guy Bluford and-
Speaker 2: Guy Bluford and Ron McNair.
Speaker 1: --They're really the first group to be trained.
Speaker 2: Yes. That's right. First group to be trained and actually fly.
Speaker 1: Right, right. And, so. I think it was in '86 [1986] that Ron McNair is (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's right.
Speaker 1: At any rate, so, so now Bernard Harris walks in space before you go up there.
Speaker 2: Bernard was the first African American to walk in space.  I was in the office at that time--I was select-- I was in the astronaut office when Bernard flew his flight and did his first space walk.
Speaker 1: Now are you married by this time?
Speaker 2: I got married during flight training.  I got married in '73 [1973].  I went to Aviation Officer Candidate School [Pensacola, Florida] finished that up, did my initial flight training, got my solo, got my commission, got married and went back to flight training.
Speaker 1: So did you meet your wife--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: In college at Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida] we were undergraduates at Florida State together.  We will celebrate forty, forty years-- what is this, thirteen?-- forty years this year. September is our fortieth anniversary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she had to support you in all of this?
Speaker 2: Yes, which she did. Very supportive obviously.
Speaker 1: So you've got children by now by '92 [1992]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had children our son was born in '76 [1976] and our daughter was born in '78 [1978].
Story_ID: 27817
Speaker 1: How did the selection come in '92 [1992]? How were you selected?
Speaker 2: Well I applied for it, you have to apply for the astronaut program and I almost didn't apply at all that's an interesting story too.  I always followed the program it was very interesting to me but I never thought really seriously about it.  One night sitting around the dinner table, another Navy aviation buddy of mine was over for dinner, he and my wife and I were just sitting at the table just talking.  And we both were getting so senior in our careers that the next thing that you have to do is go to Washington [D.C.], you have to go do the headquarters thing.  No self-respecting pilot wants to go to headquarters, you want to keep flying.  I made an off-handed remark that, "You know, I always liked the astronaut program.  I thought I wanted to be an astronaut." But I said, "Those astronauts, you know, they have eighteen Ph.D.s and eight thousand million flight hours and they do this that and the other."  And they both looked at me my wife and my friend and said, "You ought to apply for the space program." (Sort of?) caught by surprise.  I admonished myself because I never looked at myself according to what I don't have; I always looked at what qualifications I do have.  So anyway, I lay awake that whole night thinking about it and I went to work the next day and talked to my commanding officer and he said, "You really ought to apply for the space program." Just like that, so I made up my mind.  I'll apply one time to see what happens.  So I put together the best application I could and sent it in.  And over the next year and a half when they were selecting astronauts my name kept staying in the selection process and I was selected.  So it's a long process, a very competitive process that I almost did not enter at all.  But, low and behold, I, I got selected.
Speaker 1: So you were selected in 1992.
Speaker 2: Selected in '92. The class of '92 [1992]. That's right.
Speaker 1: Alright.  There's a group of fourteen--.
Speaker 2: Of fourteen Americans, that's right. We were joined by, by five international astronauts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where were they from?
Speaker 2: Oh Canada, Europe and Japan.  We had two from Canada, two from Europe and one from Japan.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so, so.  So the total then of nineteen I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually we were class number fourteen.  There were nineteen Americans and five internationals.  Yeah, we were class number fourteen.
Speaker 1: Oh, class number fourteen.
Speaker 2: We had nineteen, so twenty-four of us.  Nineteen were US, there were three thousand of everybody that applied they selected nineteen.
Speaker 1: Did everybody make it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody, oh yeah, everybody passed the candidacy training. Everybody got to fly at least one flight in space.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright
Speaker 2: But again remember, they started with three thousand so they whittled it down.
Speaker 1: To the most likely ones to make it.
Speaker 2: Well, they whittled it down to nineteen.  Once you are selected you are pretty much likely to fly.  Occasionally something happens and somebody doesn't fly but everybody, everybody got to fly.
Story_ID: 27818
Speaker 1: Tells us about the training, what was the training like? Was it--?
Speaker 2: The training was kind of a nice next step from what I was doing in the Navy.  There was a lot of academics involved.  We say training but its academics and training.  It's university level academics having to do with shuttle systems, orbital mechanics, celestial navigation and so on.  Space station, well, we were getting ready to go to space station then.  So there's academic training there is also a lot of simulators, training in simulators.  But, obviously, you don't have a practice space shuttle you have to simulate everything.  You have many different simulators for different parts of the mission.  Some are incredibly sophisticated, they move and you have visuals, some are just sort of static simulators.  We also trained in aircraft.  We have airplanes that we fly; we have large airplanes and we have these small fighters of the T38s that we fly.  In addition to your regular astronaut training, training for space flight, I guess everybody has collateral duties.  You have the ground job that you do, so my first job was an astronaut support person.  In other words, all astronauts lived in Houston [Texas] but I would I would come to the Cape [Cape Canaveral, Florida] regularly and support the space shuttle launches.  So I would be assigned a particular space shuttle and I would follow it through its flow while they were preparing it for flight.  I would keep up with the status of it, know what's going on with the systems, and then when it came time for space flight I was one of the people that would go out and configure the shuttle before the crew got in.  Shuttle for example, has thousands of switches and circuit breakers and all.  Well, the crew can't do that when they get in, they don't have time. So I would go out the night before and I would configure all the cockpit switches and dials and things and get ready for the crew.  And I would be the person that strapped the crew in when they came out to get in I was the guy that actually plugged them in and strapped them and got them ready to fly.  That's before I did my own flight.  That's one job I had another job--collateral job I had was league engineer for space stations system design.  So I would work with civilian engineers, the contractor engineers on designing, developing and testing space station systems that are operating up there right now.  So, in addition to my regular space flight training you have collateral jobs that you do.  Now when you are assigned to your mission when you get assigned to a crew to fly in space you drop all these other duties and concentrate only on your mission.  So I was assigned in my first space mission in '95 [1995], we were going to fly in '96 [1996].  So we formed up as a crew and we began training for that mission and that's what we focused on over the next year and something until we launched.  And during that year you began training for the specific things that you are going to do on your mission.  I was assigned to be flight engineer, mission specialist 2 (MS2). It's like the flight engineer which means I was part of the flight deck crew.  I was also assigned space walking, I was an EVA [extra-vehicular activity] person, so I had to prepare to do my space walk in space.  Then there are other experiments and things that you, that you are assigned to perform also.  So you spend the next year and something preparing for space flight.  And there is just so much to it, and I'm not even beginning to scratch the surface on all the details that go in to training for space flight or training for Navy missions or whatever.  Just, just so much detail to it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so. So you're working, like, long hours every day getting ready for this.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. You have long hours and you travel and you--most of your training is done in Houston [Texas] at Johnson Space Center.  A lot of it is done here at the Cape [Canaveral, Florida] at Kennedy Space Center, some is at Marshall Space Flight Center [Huntsville, Alabama], some maybe at the [Goddard Space Flight Center] Greenbelt, Maryland, some maybe out at Moffet [Moffet Federal Airfield, Mountain View, California], so yeah, you train a lot.  You are traveling a lot but you, you enjoy what you are doing.  It's challenging and it's rewarding and enjoyable.
Story_ID: 27819
Speaker 1: Now, your first flight was on the Endeavor [Space Shuttle]?
Speaker 2: Endeavor, that's right. Nine days on the Endeavor.
Speaker 1: Is this 1996?
Speaker 2: In '96 [1996], that's right.
Speaker 1: How did things go? Did everything go perfectly?
Speaker 2: Everything went, everything went fine. I don't know if perfect is the right word but we had no real bad incidents happen.  We got all of our mission accomplished.  We had two space walks, we were, we had microgravity mission, so we grew crystals in space, plants in space, had laboratory animals in space.  We deployed and retrieved the satellite, we retrieved the second satellite that was up there.  We conducted two space walks where we tested tools and equipment for building the International Space Station. So we--. Every flight is jammed packed with hundreds of events and experiments and it all went real well.  The space walks were particularly a big part of, of a, of any mission so those went real well too.  On that flight, one of the things that I had to do that was really interesting was test out improvements to the space suit, because, again, we were preparing to build the International Space Station.  It was going to be built in a location of space that was colder than we had been previously going.  So NASA [National Aeronautic and Space Administration] had modified the suit and I was going to put the suit on, go outside and test those modifications to be sure to keep astronauts warm and safe in the extra cold environment of space.  So that was one of the big important things that I did on my space walk.  Space walk was six hours and fifty-- I think it was six hours and fifty-three minutes if I remember correctly on that one.  And we did a whole bunch of other things on there also but this was one thing that was really, really important and kind of cool to do.
Story_ID: 27820
Speaker 1: What is it like sitting on top of a rocket getting reading to be, you know, launch into space?
Speaker 2: Well, the words don't adequately describe it, but you have been training for this thing for years so you are ready to go and get the show on the road.  You have been up for a long time.  By the time you actually strap into the space shuttle you've been up for a long time.  There are a lot of events that have to occur before you get there and when you are out on a launch pad you are lying down on your back with your feet up in the air and it's uncomfortable because you have been lying there for several hours.  So you are ready for this thing to get going and you don't want an abort to happen; so you have to come back and do it again the next night, you want to get going.  Also, you have got people who are relatives and friends who have come from thousands of miles to watch this, so you want to get going.
Speaker 1: So how many people are on the-- How big is it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Typ-- Well, the space shuttle typically has six people on the crew.  You may have five or you may have seven but typically you have six people crews.  On both my flights there were six people.  So there were four of us up on the flight deck and two people down on the mid deck, the lower deck.  I can remember lying there on my back during the first flight--the beginning of the first flight you can hear and watch the clock count down as you watch the gauges in front of you.  And at seven seconds is when the launch sequence begins and the computer is controlling the launch sequence.  So it has to start all three space shuttle main engines and when they do the fire and smoke begins to build up along the front wind screen.  So you're lying on your back and all this fire and smoke is building up around the wind screen you haven't gone anywhere yet and then all of a sudden when the clock hits zero the solid rocket boosters ignite and the thing jumps off the pad.  You know, when you see it on TV it looks like it comes up in slow motion but in reality it sort of boom, it kicks in the back, it jumps off the pad and it is shaking and vibrating it's not a real smooth ride.  You are trying to read your gauges and watch what's going on but it's really a shaky and rough ride.  The acceleration is incredible. By the time you have crossed the top of a launch tower you have already passed one hundred miles per hour and you pass the speed of sound in forty five seconds or there about, so it's an amazing acceleration.  When it lifts off it kind of rolls off its back, and you are kind of upside down and you can look out the front and see where you are going. And the thing-- it just continues to accelerate, it goes faster and faster and faster, never stops accelerating and there is nothing else on earth that you can ride that continuously accelerates that way.  So it is just an incredible ride that words don't adequately describe.  On my first flight we launched at night, we launched at two something in the morning so it was dark.  I can remember about halfway through the ascent to orbit I could look out ahead of me and see the day-half of the earth coming at us so that's just how fast and how high you are going.  Then after two minutes, that's the first stage, after two minutes your throttles comes down and there is a big explosion, the solid rocket boosters are blowing away from the shuttle because you don't need those anymore.  Throttles come back up and then you continue to accelerate and fly upward toward space on the main engines.  After eight and one half minutes you reach orbit and when you reach orbit you go through a sequence of events and the main engine shuts down we call it MECO, main engine cut off.  After MECO, then you can get out-- I was the first one to get out of my seat because I had some things I needed to do so I unbuckled my seat and I started floating all over the place, kind of flailing actually 'cause I'm not used to being in weightlessness.  And I take my helmet off, I have to tie it down someplace, I take my gloves off I have to tie them someplace, everything floats everyplace.  You are in continuous weightlessness you look out and there is the earth beneath you and--.
Speaker 1: So it takes about eight minutes from the time it launches to get into space (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Eight, eight and half minutes or thereabouts, to get to orbit.  So you go from sitting on the launch pad to seventeen thousand five hundred, or thereabouts, miles per hour in only eight and a half minutes.  That's what I mean when I say it is an amazing ride.   This thing just goes faster and faster and faster.
Speaker 1: We were discussing in the car one day, my colleague and I, the thin layer of atmosphere that's actually around the earth-
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: -- when you look at the whole thing it's not a lot.
Speaker 2: Paper thin, just like an onion skin from space.  Just a really amazing. Now, it's fifty miles thick or thereabout, but it looks like a tiny-- just a very thin, paper thin layer of the atmosphere going around earth, amazing.
Speaker 1: Accelerating at that speed, going fifty miles, fifty miles is not a lot of space to--.
Speaker 2: No, no, not at all.  In fact I--no it's not.  Fifty miles is not much at all, yeah, for those speeds.
Story_ID: 27821
Speaker 1: When you go up like that and look at the-- back at the earth, do you have a sense that the earth is kind of vulnerable?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, that was my thing.  The earth was small and relatively vulnerable.  The atmosphere is very thin and wispy, looks like it just could blow away any minute, yeah.  The earth itself is finite, you can the boundaries of it.  You can see continents, so yeah, the earth was very small and very vulnerable and very finite. It's not like it appears from down here.  It's not much you can do to hurt the ground from down here but when you see it up there and also when you look out and see stars and you can see other planets you realize just how small it is. It's one of many, not, not one, it's one of many.
Speaker 1: How, how is the-I mean, how accessible are the visuals up there.  Do you have a lot of windows on the shuttle?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, you do have windows, you can look out and see because we take pictures, thousands of pictures of all kinds from space as part of being up there.  So yeah, you can see the earth and you can see its makeup, its formation.  It's part of our mission, earth observation, as we call it.  So the answer is yes and it's incredible how bright and colorful the earth is, even more so than here, it's very bright and very pretty and many, many, many colors.  The example I like to use is the Sahara desert. When you see the desert on TV you know people are trapped in the desert you see all this brown sand.  When you see the desert in real life from space it's very colorful.  It's a lot of red in the desert, a lot of black, and some different shades of orange. And some parts the desert I always tell the audience, looks like a orange peel because the sand dunes that are miles apart looks like bumps on an orange peel from space.  And they're bright orange and look like an orange peel from space.  So the earth is so bright and pretty and colorful, it's absolutely, it's absolutely incredible.

Speaker 1: So, once again I know you went over it pretty fast but what were your missions on--your missions, were, were to do what things?
Speaker 2: Well on my first flight the primary mission was microgravity.  So we grew, we wanted to investigate zero gravity's effect on several processes.  First of all was plant growth in space, animal survival in space, crystal growth in space.  Crystal-- everything-- all the objects on earth have a crystalline structure and crystals formed on earth are distorted by earth's gravity.  Crystals formed in space are very symmetric.  We think that the quality of a material or an item or medicine or pharmaceutical, whatever, could be improved if the crystalline structure is not distorted.  So we grow crystals in space to try to determine how the quality of this item--how the quality might be with-- if it's grown in space with zero gravity as opposed to growing on earth.  So crystal growth experiments-- all the microgravity things.  Again another thing we did on that mission was retrieve a satellite the Japanese had launched a satellite in orbit in '95 [1995].  It had been up there for a year, our job was to retrieve it and bring it back.  Also, there was a second satellite that we took with us, it was a solar observation satellite and we deployed it, we had left it in space and then we picked it up and brought it back home.  So the two satellites deploys--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: How, how is that done?  Were these-- was the satellites you picked up, I mean, was it attached to the shuttle, was it brought outside the shuttle?
Speaker 2: Yes we put it inside the space shuttle's payload bay.  We reached out and grabbed it with the space shuttle's robot arm, a mechanical arm, and we it put down into the payload bay of the trunk kind of the shuttle to bring it back home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was launched from Japan, we went up and flew up to it, got it and brought it back.  There's a whole lot, a whole lot more to it I'm telling you it's not quite that simple but that's essentially what we did.
Speaker 1: Now did you have to get out and-
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --do a spacewalk to do this?
Speaker 2: No, this one was captured by the robot arm, the primary way you deploy satellites.
Speaker 1: (Then?) you draw into a bay.
Speaker 2: That's right. It's kind of, kind of like a crane, you know, you're inside operating it--our robot arm operator is operating it and it happened to be--it was a he on this flight, Koichi Wakata from Japan was our robot arm operator.  He could operate the arm and reach out--we would fly out to the thing and he would reach out and grapple it-attach to it and then bring it back and put it inside the bay and lock it down, there was a way we would latched it down.  And it stays there and then when we returned to earth we bring it back with us.  But there was a second satellite that we took up with us, it was an American satellite. The Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology O satellite that we took with us.  We arrived at its location in space, picked it up out of the bay and placed it into orbit and then went off and did other things for a couple of days.  Flew back up to it, grab it, put it back into the bay and bring it home.  So we had all these microgravity experiments, we had the two satellites that we had deployed--(simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Did that satellite that you brought with you shadow the shuttle, I mean, did it ride alongside the shuttle as you were--?
Speaker 2: No, we back away from it and leave it up there.  We put it in space and then we just back-- we go off and do other things, just go completely away from it and do other things.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Just leave-- it's automated, it will do its thing and then a couple of days later at the appropriate time we rendezvous with it again, fly back up to it, grab it and put it back into the bay.
Speaker 1: I, I know I've read that there are a lot of satellites now in space.  That, that are-- and do you see those up there? Do you see these--?
Speaker 2: No, you, you don't get close enough to see satellites with the naked eye.  First of all satellites are in different orbits, they are in different inclinations and different altitudes.  Like a lot of our communication satellites might be geostationary, so they are twenty-two thousand miles, the space shuttle is three hundred miles--three hundred and fifty miles or something like that.  See you have satellites in different altitudes and different locations and you try-- you want to stay away from them.  Now you do have to deconflict with satellites occasionally because on my first flight, the Endeavor [Space Shuttle], they gave us--the ground gave us a maneuver to keep us away from an old satellite.  So we didn't see it with our eyes, they saw it on radar, we maneuvered the shuttle to stay away from it because it could be a collision hazard.  We want to stay at least five miles away from any satellites.  So, ideally you won't see any satellite except the ones that you are supposed to rendezvous with and interact with.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, yeah there are lot of satellites, there is a lot of debris in space.  So we have to be careful about orbital debris also, trash and stuff for whatever reason.  Natural, some of its natural like micrometeorites and all, that's natural debris, but then there's also manmade debris, things blow up and they get left up there.  Old satellites stop working and they're up there forming trash and debris in space.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright. I wondered about that because they say there are so many objects up there, you know.
Speaker 2: It's not like-there's objects everywhere, it's not driving your car and you see trash on the side it's not quite like that, but, but there's stuff up there that you have to be careful of. And of course, that's all tracked from the ground, you know, our tracking stations can track debris the size of this, this thing here [holds up a cup], so they where it all it and they do their best to keep you away from it, because it is a danger.

Speaker 1: In space for nine days on the Endeavor [Space Shuttle].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were your days like?  Did you get a chance to sleep and, you know?
Speaker 2: Well, your days are timelined for you because you go around the earth every ninety minutes.  You got the sun going up and down and up and down sixteen times every twenty four hours.  I'm sure you have probably heard this, you don't go to sleep when the sun goes down and get up when the sun comes up.  Everything is done on a timeline. You are awake for sixteen hours and during your awake period you do the normal things.  You get up and you bathe and dress and you eat breakfast. Then you begin your day's work.  Whatever is programmed for you that day you do it and you may have-- I as an individual may have an experiment that I going to conduct for the next three hours or I might have--if it's a spacewalking day that's the big thing for that day, you spend the whole day conducting the spacewalk, you and your partner.  So anyway, you are awake for sixteen hours conducting whatever is on the agenda for that day and then you have an eight hour period that's timelined for you to sleep.  And when you get ready to sleep you turn the lights down in the shuttle and put shades over the windows and pretend it's night.  Outside the sun is going up and down up and up and down. When you are awake you put the shades down turn the lights up you pretend it's daytime when outside the sun is going up and down and up and down.  But your day is full, like I said, you've got different events.  Sometimes you might have a press conference to do or you may have an elected official call the shuttle to talk to you, or the president may call the shuttle, or the president from other--the prime minister from Japan may call, because we had a Japanese astronaut.  But-- and the different science experiments are sometimes you conduct those with somebody else, sometimes you only activate it and then you leave it alone and then you deactivate it later, sometimes you conduct an experiment yourself, so it just depends. There is no shortage of thing to do.  You don't have a lot of spare time but when you do you can do a number of things-- most, the thing that most people do is stare out of the window because it is just so amazing up there, everything is so beautiful and so different.  You spend a lot of time staring out of the window.  You spend a lot of time staring out of the window because of your job, you are taking pictures, you may have to photograph something on earth and photograph some--not just frivolous photographs, you may be looking for specific things that may be the foliage over South African or a particularly, a particular location, you may take a photograph using infrared back then we had electronic cameras but also film.  We may use infrared film which would show the amount of chlorophyll in the foliage on the ground and they could compare that with that same patch of land a year earlier and see what's happening to the land.  Or you may photograph a series of lakes and they could compare that to what was photograph a year earlier and you can see what's happening to the lakes and waters and so on, in Africa, just as an example.  So, everything has its purpose and there are just hundreds of experiments that you can conduct on any particular mission
Speaker 1: How does being in space affect your personal philosophy?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I get question all the time.  I don't think you can fly in space and not have it affect you in one way or another.  And the thing with me again is realizing how small the earth is, how finite the earth is and, and I think universally astronauts say this, they don't see any boundaries between different countries.  You know, you don't see a dividing line between country, country X and country Y but yet country X and Y are fighting with each other, they are trying to kill each other.  So, you just realize how small and fragile the earth is and you get a sense of earth as being home.  I don't think we think about that.  We don't think earth as being home because we never leave it, we are always here.  When you leave your house the last thing that you want to do at night is you want to go back home.  You want your house to be there, you want it to be safe, you want it to be secure, and you want it to be warm and dry.  You don't want to come home and find your house damaged and destroyed.  Well, the earth is the same way, you are out there and you think that's my home and I want to get back.  It is very unpleasant to think I can't get back or that something bad might be going on down there.  You kind of wish we could get to the point where, where we are all moving forward to take care of earth and work to get along better together as opposed to having terrorist activities and destructive activities going on.  So yeah, I think flying in space gives you a little bit different outlook on thing.  An outlook on philosophy, some people have a religious experience, some people have a spiritual experience, but I think it affects everybody in one way or another.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You have a chance to talk to your family, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.  Not a lot.  My first mission we talked a little bit, let's see, we were up nine days, we had a video conference and families were brought into mission control, so I got a chance to talk to my wife and talk to the kids over the link of the video.  They could, they could see me I had the camera set up so they could see me.  I was always floating something in front of the camera so the kids could say, "Yeah, dad's definitely in space." I didn't make this up, so stuff floating around in space and you get to, you get to talk to them.  Yeah you do get a little bit of a chance to talk to your family.  Nowadays, actually, then also, we had the equivalent of email didn't work exactly the same as this but similar.  So I could type up messages everyday and then bundle them up in a pack that we shoot it down to the ground so my family would receive the email then they could send me something back.  Same thing with friend and acquaintances, they could send messages up to the shuttle, the, the equivalent of an email.
Story_ID: 27824
Speaker 1: Now, now what about reentry that's--reentry can be tricky, right?
Speaker 2: Reentry is different. It's a long process over a long period of time as opposed to ascent, which is only eight and one half minutes.  Ascent is very dynamic and very fast, very quick.  Reentry is much longer.  From the time you hit entry interface what we call it when you begin to--when the drag of the atmosphere is heavy enough that you begin to feel that, that drag is entry interface.  That occurs on the opposite side of the earth, over the Indian Ocean typically, then you got about an hour to contin-- complete the reentry and fly home process and land here at Kennedy Space Center [Merritt Island, Florida].  So it's a long gradual process but it's really cool and really interesting, because of a number of things.  You gradually begin to see the effects of gravity on you, you know your weightlessness--you are weightless in orbit.  But as you begin to the hit the atmosphere and descend through you begin to slow down, gravity gradually exerts itself on you, so you feel yourself getting heavier and heavier and heavier.  Also, the space shuttle was, was maneuvering, it would be sort of making S turns or roll reversals as we call them back and forth to help dissipate all that incredible energy. Remember, it's going amazingly fast and you've got to slow it down without destroying it.  You don't want to insert too fast or you will exceed the structural limits or the heat limits of the shuttle.  So you got to dissipate all that energy and fly home and land in a particular spot.  At one point during the reentry profile you are going so fast through the air that it actually ionizes outside.  So you got this big ball of, of hot plasma billowing up around the wind screen, it's like you are riding the side of a big fireball, it's hot, three thousand or thereabouts degree plasma around the wind screen because you are going so fast through the atmosphere. And--
Speaker 1: Do you feel some of the heat?
Speaker 2: No you don't feel the heat inside.  No, the environmental control systems is working, you have your suit on--your launch and entry suit on and it's giving you--your life support system is working properly, hopefully.  So you don't feel any of that inside of the vehicle.  But, you go through all of those different stages of reentry and then, finally, I can remember, oh about ten minutes or so before touchdown being over Houston, Texas.  I could look down, way down below I could see the interstate, freeways, and the cars way down below me and then about ten minutes later we are circling over Kennedy Space Center getting ready to land.  I look down and I'm real close now, there is a runway out front there, there's automobiles down there, there is a city actually, buildings, you know, and we are getting ready to, to come in for a landing.  So we have gone from the opposite side of the earth in orbit all the way down to a particular spot in Kennedy Space Center in about an hour's time.  We have gone through all of these different phases of reentry.
Speaker 1: Now that's incredible, that's incredible.
Speaker 2: It is and you're busy and, you know, you're watching and experiencing all these different things but you are also busy, you have systems to monitor even though most of the reentry--the deorbit burn is manual, but then most of the reentry is flown by the computer but you are always monitoring to be sure that everything is operating properly and that your navigation is working properly and that you don't get outside of limits for role reversal, you are watching a lot of stuff and watch to be sure that the space shuttle systems are operating properly and so on.  So it's busy but it's also fun.
Story_ID: 27825
Speaker 1: So this is in 1996?
Speaker 2: That first flight was in 1996, the beginning of--January of '96 [1996].  The second flight was November and December, through December of '97 [1997], sixteen days on the Columbia [Space Shuttle].
Speaker 1: Okay. So-- was that, I mean, to go up a second time and stay longer, I mean, how is that experience different or how does that compare with your first time?
Speaker 2: It was an amazing experience again.  Your body remembers being up there.  The first time I went through an adaptation period.  The first time I'm up there I felt a little uneasy, queasy on the stomach and so I had to get used to being up there.  The second time it was like my body remembered; I didn't have to go through that readaptation period.  I had been there before so I was a little more at home and at ease and on the second flight I was not the rookie, I was one of the veterans, so I had some other rookies working with me so I could kind of guide them along and help them to adapt to space, get things set up much quicker and get ready to live in space and to conduct our work as we could.  One of the more interesting things that we had on that second flight was a malfunctioning satellite.  We deployed this satellite and the satellite's attitude control system did not initialize properly.  The satellite developed a very slow spin in space.  You have three thousand pound, $10 million satellite that was turning in space, a very slow turn but it was complex, what we call complex motion.  So, we could not retrieve the satellite with the robot arm and the way we eventually retrieved it was by catching it manually. My partner and I went outside and we manually caught the satellite and that was, that was quite an involved event.  It took days and days of planning and rehearsal and, and flying up to it and actually grabbing it, rotating it to its proper attitude by hand.
Speaker 1: So was this your first spacewalk?
Speaker 2: No, my first spacewalk was my first spaceflight.
Speaker 1: First flight, okay.
Speaker 2: This was the first one of this mission.  So I was a lead spacewalker on this one and the guy I had with me was, was a rookie on his first flight, first spacewalk.
Speaker 1: Spacewalk, now we didn't discuss that for the first flight but--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I tested the suit, the modifications to the suit, that was only a spacewalk.  This is the suit you put on to go outside.  Yeah that suit that's what I was talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: So my job was EVA, extra vehicular activity or spacewalking, that was one of my primary assignments on the shuttle.
Speaker 1: How are individuals selected for that activity?
Speaker 2: Well I can only speculate that everybody, not everybody, the missions specialist go through some initial spacewalk training in the pool, a neutral buoyancy lab, kind of like a big fancy swimming pool.  Some people do pretty well at it and some people have a difficult time, it is very physical.  The suit itself, the space suit weighs three hundred fifty pounds on earth so you've got all that mass that you have to move around in space, so it's very physical.  The real small people typically can't handle that, and so that's the initial screening.  People who do well in the pool I think typically are assigned the spacewalk.  In the earlier shuttle days there weren't very many spacewalks. Nowadays on the station everybody does one but in those days there weren't very many people that got to do it.  That was kind of like the job everybody wanted to do. So I was fortunate to be assigned to EVA.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, well, let's, see, So you have to learn how to manipulate certain tools--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the tools are especially designed so that you can manipulate them in space in your space suit.  And each mission carries with it different tools, each space mission, each EVA has a different purpose.  You, you do what--you train for whatever you are going to do on those EVAs.  My three space walks of course, mainly we were preparing--we were testing tools and equipment and all to build a space station, that was the focus.  So we were doing some of everything. For example, things that we take for granted down here becomes important up there.  If you are building a house down here you have to lay electrical cable or whatever, no big deal, you just run a cable, you connect one end and then you connect the other end.  In space, in the supercold of space, cables become inflexible they won't bend and break plus-I mean they won't bend, they are not pliable. Plus cables can be that big around some can be that big around, you have to have special fasteners.  You don't just plug into the wall like you do an extension cord down here it has to be fastened a certain way.  So all of those things have to be tested in space to see whether they will work, whether or not you can even bend the cable, whether you can make the connection, whether the connector will work, how does the temperature vary when you go from light to dark in space.  All of that becomes very important and those things have to be tested in space.  So, on one of my missions we had a large box with cables samples in it and connector samples and I spent an hour or something just evaluating those different cables and different connectors in space to be sure-- to determine whether or not they would work.
Speaker 1: Have you ever gone to space and discovered some material didn't work?
Speaker 2: On my particular flights we had, everything work pretty well it's amazing what a good job the engineers do in developing this stuff.  Because a lot of it is only tested for the very first time up there, so the answer is yes, things have gone up that did not work well. Things have gone up that worked so, so you redo it. Things have gone up that worked real well.  On my flights pretty much everything we tested actually worked out amazingly well, even though it was operated for the very first time up there it is no way to test it on the ground.
Story_ID: 27826
Speaker 1: So what was the toughest part of the '97 [1997] mission [on the Columbia Space Shuttle]?
Speaker 2: The toughest part of the '97 [1997]-- well, again the satellite capture, that manual satellite capture.  Yeah, that was not-- it's not a normal thing, you don't normally send people out to catch a satellite by hand.  Three thousand pounds, it's about the size of a small car and it was rotating, we didn't know whether the rotation would dampen enough that we could get it.  It had sharp edges in some places, you have to careful of where you touch.  You don't want to cut a glove in space. The coordination, you know, my partner was on his first space walk, so you are asking me to go do things like so that was the most demanding part of that mission.
Speaker 1: How did you overcome--if an object is rotating in space--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Its motion had dampened.
Speaker 1: Okay so, it had slowed, slowed way down.
Speaker 2: It slowed down enough that we could get it, otherwise we would not have been able to do it. That's right. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did you actually grab it by hand?
Speaker 2: Yes, we actually grabbed it by hand.  We flew-- our commander was flying the vehicle, I was directing him as to where the place was.  Once he flew us up to it we just watched it for awhile to see what it was doing and then I kind of guided him in the direction of where to put us.  I can remember the satellite being back here and I said, "Okay Kevin," Kevin Kregel, "Kevin, okay, it's about five feet back in the bay, okay, move us back.  Okay, now you got to rotate the support, okay, now stop." He had to bring us forward a little bit, "Okay now, lets watch it, now, you got to move us up a little," and so on.  And then we got, we got permission from mission control to actually do the capture.  So anyway, the entire--the capture part took over three and one half hours, we had been planning this for days.  It was coordination between the ground and us on, on the shuttle, so it was a long involved evolution; it was not a trivial thing at all.
Speaker 1: Aside from the task that you had performed on the spacewalk, we were talking off camera after the last roll about what is the difference in being in that suit, out doing the spacewalk as opposed to being inside the space shuttle?
Speaker 2: Yes, there is a big difference, first of all you've got a three hundred fifty pound suit on your back with all of your tools.  And also the amount of mass that you are moving around is tremendous, it's physically very demanding.  Plus you are outside, you're, you are no longer inside of this environment of the space shuttle.  You are your own space object and your suit is your space vehicle.  Your view is different you've got the helmet on and the visor out here and you've got this bulky thing and the bulky gloves that you are trying to manipulate.  You can feel the differences in temperature as you either work more or work less and when you step up your activity you get real hot.  The suit is attempting to regulate your temperature.  As you go around the earth the temperature changes because when you are on the light side of the earth you've got the sun shining on that suit, you get warm, on the dark side you get cold, depending on what you do.  The light changes, everything is incredibly bright and clear through your visor and when you go from the dark side of earth to the light side, the sun is so incredibly bright you can't work unless you put--you have to put a visor down--a coded visor to block out all that incredibly bright sunlight otherwise you won't be able to work, and the dark side you have lights up here that you have to actually--it's just an incredible dynamic environment up there that you experience more so when you are outside than you do when you are inside of the protection of the shuttle.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the weight of that suit you still feel the weight of that suit in spite of the fact that you are weightless.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes. What you really feel--you still feel the mass it doesn't weigh anything but there is so much of it there.  It is still a lot of effort to move the suit and to working it.  Also the suit is pressurized, so the suit somewhat resist your movement. For example, if I'm going to pick something up in space, if I'm going to pick it up and I close my fingers the suit is working against me, pushing my fingers out.  Or if I'm going to adjust--the computer is here onboard the suit that monitors the suit function, if I'm going to adjust something I bend my arm and the suit is attempting to open my arms so everything you do takes a lot of effort.  You've trained in that suit for a long time, you've been training for about a year and you build an amazing physical strength by just working in the suit.  We call it EVA [extra-vehicular activity] hands or EVA arms because you aren't aware of but you build up quite, quite good, good strength by working in that suit.
Story_ID: 27827
Speaker 1: Sixteen days is a long time, you know, to be there [in space].  What's the record for, for, being in space?
Speaker 2: The space shuttle was only designed for, eighteen days or so maximum something like that.  I don't know what the exact record is but sixteen days is relatively long but it's not bad.  There have been a number of sixteen day flights on the space shuttle.  Typically it's been nine or ten days but there have been a number of fourteen/sixteen day flights.
Speaker 1: I guess there were the astronauts that go up in space station, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, space station today now is a longer duration, the crews would stay up three or four months before they rotate out.  And the space station is much bigger, you couldn't spend three months in the shuttle, it's too small.  Space station is much larger, so from a psychology-- psychological standpoint from a general living in space standpoint you have got much more room obviously for a three month stay you need a lot more room and a different schedule than you could have for a sixteen day stay.
Speaker 1: Do people experience angst up there?  You know, really, you ever heard any stories of anyone--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Prob-- probably not, because astronauts today are so heavily selected in training, they screen out those kind of things in the screening process.  Now, as we go forward in space and we broaden the selection pool you probably will-- some people will definitely experience maladies up there, no doubt about it.  The he isolation, the claustrophobia, and all kinds of issues, separation, oh yeah, it's not for everybody.  If you send the wrong people up there some things could go wrong.  That's why the screening process is such a heavy one and a lot of the screening is psychological.  It's a lot of time during the interview process.  Those who were selected as finalist were brought to [Lyndon B.] Johnson Space Center [Houston, Texas] for a week of interviews, medical screening, and psychological screening.  Then your training process is very rigorous, so issues would likely be discovered ahead of time before sending someone up.  But I can tell you it is not for everybody.  It's potential for bad things to happen up there if you send the wrong people.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, so when you come back they send you through quite a few tests still, right?
Speaker 2: You, you conduct-- you do go through a lot of medical tests, not as extensive, well I shouldn't say extensive-- we don't go into quarantine when we come back unless you are involved in some special test.  The early days the folks were quarantined. Well, now we realize (earth?) orbit there is not a whole lot to go wrong up there and so you do have extensive medical evaluations and you write all kinds of reports and debriefs when you get back.  Everything you do in space has to be debriefed in an official and thorough manner.  Also, there is the public appearance aspect of it to when you get back.  You do a lot of, well, you do public appearances all the time, but when you get back there is a period when you do nothing but public appearances.  When you go around you brief the general public but you also may meet with elective representatives, you may meet with elected representative in Japan, we had a Japanese astronaut, for example.  Or the Ukraine or other countries, their elected officials want to be debriefed also.  So yes, there is a lot of medical examinations going on, a lot of debriefing, reports to be given and also public relations type events that occur.
Story_ID: 27828
Speaker 1: Now did any civilians go up with you on these flights-(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: Well yeah there were several civilians.  There were military people and also civilians are involved on both flights.  Astronauts make up about half and half nowadays.  Used to be all military in the early days but yeah I had several civilians on the flight also.
Speaker 1: School teachers, people--(simultaneous) (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well no when I say civilians I mean they were typically scientist, I didn't have any teachers.  There are a handful of teachers that are being selected now for a teacher's space program.  But everybody--traditional astronauts are either military pilots or civilian scientists and engineers so yes we had civilians on the flight too.
Speaker 1: So, so the third flight--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I only had two flights.
Speaker 1: Okay. Only two, okay.  Did you want to go back? (unclear).
Speaker 2: I would have gone back again but other opportunities came along.  I began to evaluate whether it was time to leave and move on and decided to do that.  I had done-- I had the opportunity and the privilege of having done pretty much everything in space you could do at that time.  So it was time to move on I decided.  Had I stayed, yes, there would have been a third flight, a fourth flight perhaps.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you retired in 1999?
Speaker 2: '99 [1999] that's right.
Speaker 1: From NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] and the--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And the Navy.
Speaker 1: (And the U.S. Navy?) Okay.
Speaker 2: Right. So I spent seven years as an active astronaut.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  So you got the chance to meet the president, I suppose?
Speaker 2: Well, President Clinton [President Bill Clinton] was in office at that time I did meet President Clinton. I met President Obama [President Barack Obama] here [Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Florida], since I've been here.  But during my astronaut days I did meet President Clinton at that time and I also talked with him, met him in person after my first flight and then he called the space shuttle and talked with us during my second mission, so I got a chance to meet the president and a lot of other people.  As an astronaut you get invited a lot of places and treated real well.  You meet a lot of people, a lot of nice people.
Speaker 1: What's the most memorable I guess--is there any, or is there a one, a most memorable event that occurred when you were in space?
Speaker 2: Well, again, the space walk.  The satellite capture, that is the most memorable event.  That was the most demanding thing and the most risky thing that we did.  The most unusual thing that we did, so certainly that stands out.  But everything you do in space stands out even the most trivial things, like this general living in space.  Eating and sleeping and living you know, getting along with the crew in space, preparing meals in space, having time together, playing games in space.
Story_ID: 27829
Speaker 1: I know we've-- we have all been to the Discovery Zone, or to the Museum of Science and Industry and seen astronaut food, astronaut ice cream.  I'm ashamed to even ask this question on some level but what kind of food--do you all eat the same stuff that they sell on the--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: We eat the same stuff you eat down here but obviously it's, it's prepared specially.  Like you saw at the Discovery Center and prior to going in space one of things you do is you prepare your menu.  And NASA [Nation Aeronautics and Space Administration] has registered dieticians that work with us to help prepare each menu for each person each day and the menus are tailor made to each individual person.  You sample the food, you go into the research kitchens and they prepare the food and you sample what you like and you can prepare your meal for each day.  And then the dieticians will review your menu to be sure you are going to get all the nutrients you need for what you are going to be doing on that particular day.  For example, on a day I'm going to be doing a spacewalk, I will need extra, extra calories and nutrients because I will be, I will be inside cooped up inside that space suit for perhaps ten hours.  So I don't get a chance to eat, I will eat breakfast first and then I won' eat again until after the EVA [extra-vehicular activity] is over at the end of the day.  So they review my diet for that day and be sure that I got all the proper nutrients on there if not they will modify the diet.  So anyway once you are in space your diet consists of what you selected.  For example, breakfast you might have scrambled eggs for breakfast, you might have sausage patties, you might have cereal if you want it, coffee, tea, milk.
Speaker 1: Will it be a real egg?
Speaker 2: Well, it would be dehydrated (laugh).  The eggs are dehydrated.  So the eggs are inside this little cellophane packet--a little bowl with cellophane on the top.  This big glob of yellow stuff inside there and there's a label on top that might say scrambled eggs or Mexican scrambled eggs and it might say three to five minutes hot water.  Well, you have to put the water back into it and of course, you can't pour water in space, don't take a pitcher and pour water because it floats all over the place.  So you have to attach the scrambled egg carton to the rehydration station, it has a syringe on it so you insert the package on to the syringe, you dial in three ounces, if that's what is called for and you hit the hot button as you want hot water.  The station automatically injects the hot water into the packet. Then you have to let it permeate, let it sort of soak in to all of those eggs.  There is velcro on the back of the package. Remember, there is not gravity so I can't just sit the package down like I would sit this down.  I can set this anyplace I want to, I can just sit this up on the ceiling or on the wall or whatever because there is no up or down or gravity in space.  At the end of three minutes I reach up and get my packet, now it looks like scrambled eggs, the water has permeated.  If I want to season them I can't sprinkle salt and pepper, it floats all over the place.  I have to use liquid salt, liquid pepper.  We have a little salt bottle with a nozzle on the end of it, take my scissors and I slit the top of the cellophane, take the salt, insert the nozzle, squirt a little bit of liquid salt. It permeates the eggs then cover that up.  Then take the pepper take the top off, squirt a little bit of liquid pepper, it permeates the eggs.  Close, close the cap, velcro the salt and pepper off someplace.  Take my scissors, now I can't cut the cellophane open, take my fork or spoon and very carefully reach in and take out only what I want and eat my scrambled egg, you have to be careful because those particles of eggs float all over the place and you have to go chase them down and catch them.  So, eating in space is a process that is a lot of fun but it also has to be done very carefully because your food will get away from you.  But the food in space these days is real food, it's not the tube stuff, you eat with a real fork and knife and spoon. But the food, again, is processed in different ways, some of it is dehydrated, some of it meals ready to eat like military type meals, you just heat it up open and eat it and some of that is thermal stabilized and some of it is fresh, so different foods.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have some fresh foods then--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: I shouldn't say fresh, you do get fresh food occasionally for example, space station for folks when they get a shipment up there will some fresh foods in there.  You have to eat it quickly because when food begins to spoil, obviously, you don't want that.  There is no place to throw it away, kind of like your garbage can outside.
Speaker 1: Can't throw it out the window.
Speaker 2: You can't just throw it out of the window or put it in your a garbage can.  So fresh food needs to be eaten, eaten quickly, but we might have food like applesauce for example, or jello. Apple sauce you just open the can and you eat it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, limited fresh food but some.
Story_ID: 27830
Speaker 1: Typically, when you get back is there, is there any physical manifestation-- I mean, or consequences of being in space?
Speaker 2: You do have to readapt to being back on earth.  You adapt to going up there but you readapt also and the first thing you notice when you are back from space is how heavy you feel.  Because in space you float everywhere you need to go and so you haven't carried your body weight in however long you have been gone, sixteen days or whatever. You haven't actually carried your weight.  The first time you stand up, you are picking up and carrying this weight and you feel very, very heavy.  And also, your balance is just a little bit off so you don't negotiate--you are little bit wobbly when you walk, so you don't balance yourself very well so you have to walk very carefully and be careful what you do.  Careful driving, first day you are back you might not want to drive until you get used to being back a little bit.  It takes awhile to get over the soreness because carrying your weight gets your body sore, your back and legs and all become sore.  You have to readapt to sleeping on earth because you are typically sleep shifted. When you are lying in bed it feels like you are going to float away from the bed, for example. Things like that and, yes, there is a readaptation period.  Also the body has to readapt in ways that you don't feel. For example, you might feel perfectly normal after a week but you might not have regained the strength in your body that you had when you left, so you want to be careful not to do too strenuous things like play basketball or racquetball or whatever because you could easily get stress fractures in your bones.  So you gradually readapt to being back on earth.  Just like you adapt to going up there.
Story_ID: 27831
Speaker 1: When you retired [from NASA, National Aeronautics and Space Administation] in '99 [1999] what were your prospects--what did you---simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well one of the reasons I retired was because I was offered a job back at my alma mater, at Florida State University [FSU, Tallahassee, Florida].  The president [Talbot D'Alemberte] offered me a job as vice president for student affairs and as associate dean in engineering back at Florida State.  That was a great opportunity that I wanted to think seriously about it.  I didn't want to pass it up, so that, that was really one of the driving factors for my retirement.  I had twenty-seven years in active duty, seven as an astronaut and this was a great opportunity, so that helped me make the decision to retire.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you went over to Florida State--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and took that job.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well-- and you were there for four years.
Speaker 2: Four years.
Speaker 1: Four years and-- so how did you like that?
Speaker 2: Oh I enjoyed it very much.  It was a good transition out of the military and NASA back into civilian life and a good experience working at a University.  I learned a lot of things; it was a good experience for me.  So I enjoyed it very much, it was good being back on the FSU campus and seeing how things had changed over years since I was there as an undergraduate and many things, as you guess, had changed.  Some things were similar to when I was an undergraduate.
Speaker 1: Did you ever find out why they discontinued engineering?  I mean now, apparently it is back up and running now--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes it's been back and running for many years now.  No, I did not know and we were undergraduates so we didn't know, we were just told this is just what's going to happen and you guys have to go and do something else.  So we really didn't know why--I can only assume that it had something to do with money.  Everything is usually financially driven and this was in the early '70s [1970s].  That was the wind down of the Apollo program [NASA human spaceflight program] so there were a lot of engineers out of work because the space program, remember Apollo was over.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So here in the Florida area-- (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: No, I mean all over the nation, but particularly here in Florida, engineers were out of work.  There just was suddenly no need for engineers because our Apollo program had ended.  So, perhaps that was the driving factor but we never got a reason, I never learned a reason of why, but they actually shut it down.  And of course, now, it has been opened now for many years.
Speaker 1: As a former dean of engineering what are the, I guess, the most exciting occupations in engineering these days?
Speaker 2: Well, it depends on the individual, what they like. For me obviously my engineering loves have to do with flying things.  Aerospace, aeronautical here at Florida Tech [Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Florida] our most popular major is aerospace engineering you know we are on the space coast.  Most of our students want to be aerospace engineers but electrical engineering is also very popular, biomedical is popular these days, computer engineering is very popular.  A lot of people want to get into not so much computer design but a lot of people want to get into gaming, so that's under computer science, they want to do that.  Automotive is popular here for us but aerospace is the number one engineering major.  We actually have students who design and build rockets and we have rocket competitions, they launch their own rockets, they want to go out and get involved in the space program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you were at Florida State for--
Speaker 2: For four years.
Speaker 1: --for four years.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--oh I see here that it was the FAMU-FSU college--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's right the college of engineering is joint between FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and FSU, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  They are both in Tallahassee, Florida?
Speaker 2: Yes, both were in and very close together.  It goes back to the old days FSU historically white, FAMU historically black and they still exists.  Two separate universities but that's one area which they are joint, have a joint program.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they could be compared to like LSU [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana] and Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right. Same thing.
Speaker 1: Very similar.
Speaker 2: Very similar.
Story_ID: 27832
Speaker 1: So you were there [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida] for four years, until 2003.
Speaker 2: O-three [2003], that's right.
Speaker 1: And what, what happened in '03 [2003]?
Speaker 2: Well, in '03 [2003] I came down-- took a job here at the Cape [Cape Canaveral, Florida] to direct what is called the Florida Space Authority.  There are some fourteen or so states around the country that have state space agencies.  The Florida Space Authority is the prototype, it's the state space agency.  At the time I reported to the governor and we were concerned with ensuring that space-related businesses thrived and prospered here in the state of Florida, commercial businesses, space support businesses and so on.  So that's what I was doing and had an office up at Cape Canaveral and we were concerned with keeping the state of Florida strong in space.  There is competition for space-related businesses now, among the states.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's competition but is Florida in a good position?
Speaker 2: Florida has traditionally, historically been in a good position because of all of the launches, the human launches have occurred from here and a lot of the unmanned launches but that's slowly changing.  There other states are getting launch capabilities now, you know, Virginia for example, Wallops Island. Unmanned launches can go from anywhere.  California launches a lot of rockets into space, Texas is competing, New Mexico. In fact, the first commercial spaceport designed and built from the ground up is in New Mexico.  The big rockets, like NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] has launched, have to come from here there are advantageous but the smaller commercial private launches can go almost from anywhere.  So the companies that do this naturally look for the best business environment for them.  So they can go to Texas, they can go to New Mexico, they can go to Virginia, they can go to California, there are a number of places they can launch from.
Speaker 1: I used to wonder when I was a youth watching the space launches on television, why Florida was, was the home of the, you know, space launching programs.  Is there a reason why Florida was--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah there are several reasons. There is a physical reason because when you launch big rockets like that when you are trying to go to the moon for example, you launch from the East Coast for a couple of reasons.  You launch out over the water so you are not over populated areas if something goes wrong.  Also you launch going east, notice we always launch to the east because you take advantage of the earth's rotation.  That speed actually adds to the rocket speed and, and makes it easier, so to speak, to get into orbit than if you launch going in the opposite direction.  There is also some political reason, I think the Cape came about because well the Air Force part was already here so it was unpopulated back in those days.  You would come and experiment with the rockets and blow stuff up and not hurt people.  So the, the politics of the day and the nature of the land, so to speak, lending itself to those earlier rocket test flights and development of the of the, flight test program here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I noticed even in those days though there were like several launchings that had weather delays.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, weather would delay a launch that's why you have certain weather criteria that you want to meet for a number of reasons with people, obviously, is the safety of the vehicle you don't want to launch like through thunder storms, for example or that type of thing.  Through hail or heavy turbulence or heavy--and certain wind limitations.  With the shuttle if something went wrong there's a possibility you could have flown the shuttle back to land so you want to have good enough weather but you had to return to launch site, you could come back and land.  Now fortunately we never had to exercise that, never been tested, I don't know if it worked or not, it's only tested simulation, so weather is important.  Also for unmanned launches again you want the integrity of the rocket to remain intact.  So you don't lightening striking the rocket or launching through a bad weather-- or heavy winds that could blow it off course.  The launch windows and fuel requirements are very, very tight, so you want everything working in your favor to get the rocket to where it ought to be with the limited amount of fuel you have.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But Florida still kind of remains a good physical location--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Florida is still the leading state for space launches but I can tell you that could very easily change with the smaller commercial (unclear) that are being launched now so we are in serious competition with some other states.
Speaker 1: While working for Florida Space Authority you were also teaching part time at Florida Institute of Technology [Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: Right here at Florida Tech, that's right.  I was an adjunct in the college of aeronautics, so I would give presentations and lectures and so on to students in aeronautics.
Speaker 1: I was going to say, did that connection lead to the job that you have today?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes I'm sure it did.  My connection to the president [James Catanese] here actually goes back before that.  Our president here at Florida Tech used to be president at Florida Atlantic University [FAU, Boca Raton, Florida].  When I flew my first space flight being from Miami and FAU is down in the Miami area he invited me to a commencement to be one of the speakers at commencement and presenting a honorary doctorate degree so that's when I first met him.  Well, when I met him again here at Florida Tech when I was teaching as an adjunct and then when I left the Space Authority, I did two years in private industry and came back here under his leadership to take a job here.  So yes, that relationship led to where I am now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 27833
Speaker 1: Alright, now, 2005 you published a memoir called 'Reflections from Earth's Orbit.'
Speaker 2: That's right. Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, reading the reviews we have, it is well received.  A lot of people really like it.
Speaker 2: I'm very pleased. My goal in writing the book was two things.  First of all to share my experiences in space and to do it in a unique way and I will talk about that.  And also I wrote the book myself, I didn't have a ghost writer.  And I wanted to have it professionally published and it was picked up and published by Collector'ss Guide Publishing Company in Canada.  So it's professionally published, I'm really pleased with that.  And yes the reviews have universally been really, really good.  Now I'm not getting rich off the book, but it's been very well received.  People who read it enjoy and I am very pleased of that.
Speaker 1: Is that--that is quite a compliment that it is reviewed so well, because I think people expect that it's perfunctory for the astronaut or anyone that does something singularly unique, like what you've done, to write a book but they are not always the best books.
Speaker 2: No, a lot of them I think quite frankly are kind of dry, on the dry side.  I wanted to make my book different. And this book is different because it's a book that sort of takes the reader into space with me.  And from the reviews I think I have accomplished that.  People--when they read the book they feel as though they are there with me and while they are in orbit I reflect back on different things that happened in my life.  So in that respect it is biographical, but it is not your typical autobiography, you know.  That's why it's called 'Reflections from Earth's Orbit,' I take the reader into space and then reflect on different aspects from my life.  So in that sense, everybody can identify with something in that book because a lot of things I experienced growing up, many other people experienced them also.  So no matter who you are or what your interest, you can identify with that book because you are reading and say, "Oh, yeah I had that same experience when I grew up or I had a similar experience when I was in college."  Or, "I had this experience," at the same time you are in orbit with me.  You can kind of feel what's it's like to be in space, you feel the ascent. I am very pleased
Speaker 1: (simultaneous) Did that experience cause you to reflect more? I mean, there is always a story when a person is in danger or an excited situation there life flashes before them and that sort of thing.  Did the experience of being in space caused you to reflect on growing up in the different things that happened.
Speaker 2: Well, yes but not in the since that I was in danger or my life flashed before my eyes fortunately I didn't have anything like that happen.  But certainly the fact that I have been able to do something in life that very few people have done caused me to reflect on life and reflect on the various steps and stages and people that helped me get there because it is so unusual.  The fact that it happened to me and not somebody else, yeah, it makes you reflect a lot.  There are few people who have done this and I marvel everyday on how it happened.  The events that took place to get me there and I worked for it too, but still, a lot of things that fell into place and a lot of people that assisted me along the way.  You know, those things, those, those things-- Yeah you do reflect you certainly do because it could have been somebody else or it could have not happened had this not occurred that wouldn't have occurred, had that might occurred than this might not have occurred.  So yes, it makes you reflective of life and the things that you have gone through.  Also, it tries to give you--I try to keep in perspective where I am now.  I mean, it gives me a perspective in life that I carry with me every day right now.  I try not to get worked up over little things, little trivial things that we sometime blow up everyday in life. I have to remember those things are trivial there is so much more to life and to the world and to the universe then this little trivial that is annoying me right now.
Speaker 1: Now do you make a-- is there a common bond, I guess between people who have the experiences--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh yes there is a bond that you share with other people who have flown in space and you know a lot of them.  Pretty much all the Americans and a lot of the internationals, and yeah, you do have a common bond.  And you keep in touch, not all the time, you get in touch with other astronauts or I will hear from them or I will run into them and it's always that bond because you shared something that very few people get to share, but yeah absolutely.  It's probably the same as the military.  Folks who serve in the war together they have a strong bond that always feel and probably other professions too.  People who play in the NFL [National Football League] together, you know, probably have a special bond.  The space flight is unlike the NFL; unlike even war it's different.
Story_ID: 27834
Speaker 1: I think it's something, I guess from the perspective of being an African American, that, you know, it's hard to imagine yourself doing when you are growing up, you know, and thinking that you're going to have this chance to do--
Speaker 2: Absolutely, very difficult to imagine that's why when people ask me, "Did you want to be an astronaut when you were a kid?" I tell them, "I never thought about it."  I watched the program, it was interesting.  Our teacher brought in pictures and slides, I read these books about space, I watched 'Star Trek' on TV and watched the airplane movies like most, I never thought I would do it.  It just didn't occur to me it wasn't a reality.  It's like watching Superman, it's cool but I don't think I can do it.  No, it never occurred to me that it would become a reality.
Speaker 1: But if you could do it you probably couldn't imagine yourself getting the chance to do it.
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely.
Speaker 1: So, that's a-- I wonder, do the African American astronauts kind of have a reunion every now and then together?
Speaker 2: No, we don't typically have reunions of just African American astronauts there are so few of us and so spread out now.  When I was in Houston [Texas] at one time there's a good core of us in Houston and we would get together every once and a while.  I typically run into other African American astronauts at the regular reunions.  We have an astronaut reunion coming up this year. Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend this year.  But I typically keep in touch by email and every once and a while I get an email or a phone call or whatever.  Or if I'm in Houston those that are there I might get together with them, but there is only a handful of us.
Speaker 1: What about behind the scenes?  For people watching this I know I was surprised to find out that Katherine Johnson was a human calculator, you know at, at, in Hampton [Virginia] for NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration].
Speaker 2: I read about her but I never met her.
Speaker 1: I mean, who would imagine that? There are other African Americans who are behind the scenes, like my brother's former girlfriend in Houston designed astronaut food but who would--are there--what about the opportunities you know, (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, opportunities are immense for work in--well engineering and science in general, NASA in particular and the space flight program.  In fact, I talk to students a lot and I always encourage them to look at those other jobs.  Like, everybody involved in the space program doesn't have to be an astronaut.  There are so many other jobs like you said, dieticians, these are all university educated dietitians and people--there are a lot of engineers who work behind the scenes on the contractor side to design the vehicles and to test the vehicles and a lot of engineers on the NASA side that work with the contractors to design and test and build these vehicles.  The people who man mission control are all engineers, the people you see on the consoles on TV, you know, those people are all degreed engineers they are specialist in their particular area.  I did electrical engineering or structures or whatever, there are people who actually work at the Cape [Cape Canaveral, Florida] who have to keep the Cape up and operating, somebody has to keep the launch pads fixed or working properly your construction engineers and architects.  There are people who are meteorologists, meteorologists are heavily involved remember we talked about the weather and there are flight dynamisis.  The list just goes on and on and on of people of various professions who work in the space industry and those are jobs that are available for all of our young people to pursue.  Photography, you know, documentation has to come from space and people are trained photographers.  We spend a lot of time being trained by photographers to take pictures in space, you know.  That time we were using electronic cameras but also film cameras, we were using camcorders and electronic cameras, and sixteen millimeter cameras, thirty-two millimeter cameras.  So, it is just so many professions that impact the space program and so many good opportunities for young people.
Story_ID: 27835
Speaker 1: So today you are Senior Vice President of the External Relations and Economic Development.
Speaker 2: That's a long title.
Speaker 1: For the Florida Institute of Technology [Melbourne, Florida].  And so, so you are doing fundraising, I guess, on some level.
Speaker 2: Well yes and no.  I have two hats, economic development; my primary project is to start the Florida Tech Research Park.  So our university is growing and we are a tier one research university, we are almost at one hundred million dollars of sponsored research.  Well, as we grow we naturally want a university research park just like other large universities.  Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] is probably the most known, Silicon Valley [San Francisco, California] is another one, so those are big ones.  So anyway my project in that respect was to start the Florida Tech Research Park and we are off the ground with that, in fact, about month ago we had the official ground breaking grand opening of the Florida Tech Research Park so that's one hat.  My other hat is external relations and what I do in that respect is represent the president to organizations in the community in areas that he can't represent himself.  For example, I'm on the board of the Chamber of Commerce, I'm on the board of the Economic Development Commission, I'm on the board of the Central Florida Partnership and so on.  So I represent the president to the external community.  I go out and I'm giving speeches, presentations, and attending events, and on boards, the board of the directors where decisions are made about the economy of Florida and so on about bringing businesses to Florida.  Because as you know, universities these days can't afford to be these isolated, closed in little entities. The university, if it is going to be viable, has to be a part of a larger community.  So it's, so my job is to be out and a viable member of that larger community and represent the university.
Speaker 1: I suppose to keep that information flowing from here to the community and back.
Speaker 2: And back that's right and to form partnerships for the community.  Because right now the university partners with a lot of different entities and businesses in the community.  Again the university is no longer these closed little--we have business agreements with companies, we may enter into a research agreement, we may submit a request for grant money and list a bunch of companies out as being partners with us on the grant.  Well, those come from relationships between your university and the community, and that's very important.  Again I represent the president to all of those organizations out in the community.
Story_ID: 27836
Speaker 1: When you look back on everything you have done to this point, what today do you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think and of course, no one would ever be able to answer that except in hindsight and I'm not at the point yet where a legacy has been established.  Somebody else may have to do that long after I'm gone.  But, I-- it maybe that my legacy will be the influence I had on young people in the community, perhaps.  I have spent a lot of time with the students in the community and trying to inspire them, move them on.  That may be the greatest legacy, I don't necessarily think the greatest legacy I leave would be flying in space itself, even though that's a great accomplishment. I'm very privileged to have done that.  I think what is more important is not the space flight but what I do with that space flight experience and I think giving back to the community is more, is most important.  So in that respect I'm hoping perhaps my greatest legacy will be what impact I had on some branch of the community and hopefully it will be young people because I think the future of our country and our world obviously hinges on young people who are going to come up and be leaders of tomorrow, that's what's going to determine what is going to happen with our world, our community.
Story_ID: 27837
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, my concerns, well, concerns and hopes, my concerns are that the African American community not be left behind.  We have so many students and young people still who are not viable members of the community.  We have so many who still don't get good educations, we have so many young people who have--we don't have families that are intact, and they have all these children and not able to take of the children.  We have so many people who are not focusing on solid choices in the community.  We still do a lot of bling, frivolous things and we still don't gravitate toward higher education the way we ought to.  We still don't have enough young people moving up in leadership roles in industry and in government.  We have an African American president but we still don't have as many throughout the entire system as we ought to have.  What happens when he is out of office?  So my concern is that African American people need to continue to move up and to move forward and take our places among leaders of America not just in government but throughout industry.  You have very few African American CEOs [chief operating officers] of companies, or bankers, or investors, inventors, researchers.  So that's my, my biggest concern and my biggest hope, though, is the same thing, is that we can turn that around.  Is that we can encourage young people to really embrace education, to embrace experience and take our place in leadership roles in every aspect of the, of the world.

Speaker 1: Now, now when you look back on everything you have done to this point again is there anything major that you wish you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: No, I think about that a lot at times and I try not to ever look back and wish I had or wish something had been different.  You know, my life took the course that it did and I took the course that I did.  I guess, you, you can always look back in hindsight and say I wish I had done something differently, you know I wish maybe I had--I don't know maybe I had (pause) studied harder when I was in high school or something, I don't know.  Or maybe if I had gone to college earlier but I went to college at eighteen like most people do.  Or maybe if I had started studying engineering from day one as opposed to year three. I don't know, I try not to get into those things.  I've been very fortunate and have been very successful.  You know, we all, we each run the course that's laid out in front of us, we have to navigate.  We all have a course--an obstacle course that we have to navigate and those of us that choose to run those obstacle course, you do the best you can, so I try not to look back and say I wish I had done something differently.

Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm married to my wife, we met in college years ago and we will celebrate forty years of marriage this coming September.  She teaches here, she is a faculty member here at Florida Tech in computer science.  She taught at Florida State University, computer science and she has run her own business in computer science.  She's, she's a very successful professional and academically.  We have got two adult children.  Our daughter is a journalist, she has her master's degree in journalism. She's worked for the 'Associated Press' in Atlanta [Georgia], 'St. Petersburg Times', and she worked here at Florida for the their newspaper.  She worked for the Associated Press in Manhattan [New York] for five years.  She got married just a little over a year ago so she and her husband live in New Jersey and she is doing free lance part time writing and stuff right now.  Our son is a Naval Academy [United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland] graduate.  He is currently on active duty as a naval aviator.  He studied aerospace engineering at the Naval Academy, he flies F18 fighters and he was just recently selected for command. So he will become commanding officer of a Navy fighter squadron.  He was just selected for promotion from a lieutenant commander to commander.  So, they both, both kids are up and out and doing real well.  We have no grands at the moment, we are little behind schedule for grandkids but that will come in due time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you are still playing the trumpet?
Speaker 2: Still playing the trumpet that's right.  In fact, I really like Florida Tech [Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Florida] because in addition to my administrative duties, I am a professor in aeronautics so I still get to go over and give lectures and presentation on spaceflight or airplanes or whatever but I am also a professor of music.  I have a degree in engineering but I also have a degree in music, so I teach a music course.  The course I actually teach is the advanced improvisation course. I direct the advanced jazz ensemble course here at the university.  It is a four credit course where the students play jazz and, again, this is the advance course.  So they come out of the Panther Big Band as we call it into my group and we explore all kinds of jazz genres as they learn to play and improvise.  So I, I get to do both things.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite jazz musician?
Speaker 2: Miles Davis a trumpet player and Wynton Marsalis would be my next favorite.  But Miles is definitely my all time favorite jazz musician.

Speaker 1: Now, is there anything we haven't discussed we need to bring up before I--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have about eight million other things that we could talk about if we had time (laugh).  We have this is just trivial, separate but related our president [Anthony Catanese] here [at the Florida Institute of Technology, Melbourne, Florida] is really a great visionary.  He is a Ph.D. architectural engineering by education but he is also a musician, he plays drums.  He put together a faculty band and everybody in the band except our professor of music, everybody in the band is an engineer or a scientist over at the university.  It's really quite a good group, we've done two CDs, we just released our second CD and everything on the CD is written by the band.  And we sell them but the money, of course, goes to student scholarships.  So, it's probably the only all higher ed band in the country with the exception of schools that have a school of music with music professors. We are an engineering school.  So it really is pretty good it is a good group, good music, good fun group.  We are not a garage band, this is a good quality group.  So this is a unique place here, we do some interesting things here at Florida Tech.  Every student that comes has to have a hands-on experience; it is not just all book learning.  Everybody does some kind of a, of a capstone event where they are really doing something.  They are designing and building or testing or evaluating.  We have a flight program here, so while the students are getting their academic degrees they can learn to fly.  Our students graduate from here and they go off and fly for Delta [Airlines], United [Airlines] or whatever.  All kinds of aspects of aviation, they can go off and work in engineering programs, they can go off and work in psychology or business.  So it's a unique place and a perfect place for me to be at this point in my life.
Speaker 1: So does Florida Tech have a program that reach out to minority students in high schools and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Florida Tech reaches out to all.  We don't have a special program where you deliberately go target minorities.  We do go target minorities, we go target everybody.  I just attended the Brevard Neighborhood Development Coalition which is primarily minority students. I was their keynote speaker last year.  I was also speaker at a program called The Summit of Seven that is sponsored by Shiloh Baptist Church, its all minorities.  I was authorized to saying that anybody in this program that applies to Florida Tech and attends will receive a minimum ten thousand dollar scholarship.  So through my duties and our recruiting effort at our recruiting office we do recruit minorities, we reach out to all students.  We, we don't have a special minority recruitment program but we recruit, from all aspects of life including the African American community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We don't get as many as we would like we are a private school and I think the entry standards are pretty high not saying our students can't make it but the entry standards are pretty high, and also, I think a lot people assume we are unaffordable.  And I try to get students when I talk them, I tell them, "Don't make those assumptions.  Take a look at us, see what you like and then come and then give it a try. We have financial packages and so on."  We are about 22 percent international students. We have students from all over the world, and in all fifty states, and in all ethnic groups.  We don't have as many African Americans as we would like, we don't have as many Hispanics as we would like, remember where we are located. A lot of Hispanics in Miami [Florida], but not very many here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I didn't even realize that how they are dispersed around Florida.
Speaker 2: That's right.  We would like to see more Hispanic here, in fact, we have a recruiting effort and we do branch out into Miami and we do branch out into the local communities, African American communities.  In fact, another thing when I was talking about Florida Tech we sponsor the Julius Montgomery Award every year in celebration.  Julius Montgomery was the first African American to attend Florida Tech and we do a celebration and an awards ceremony every year to support that.  We perform every year one or more black history month--African American history month celebrations.  Two years ago we celebrated Tuskegee Airman we had four originally-- original Tuskegee Airman on campus that we featured.  And we led the effort to rename one of the airport roads Tuskegee Airman Way, yeah, we did that and the city went along with it.  So we have a significant effort to engage with the entire community, including the African American community.  We reach out to all communities.  We want to be a part of every community.
Speaker 1: And by, by the community you mean in and around Melbourne and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, primarily yes because that's where we are located, but to a lesser extent the entire state and all over the country. But obviously we have to spend most our resources here in the local area.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now is there anything else you need to mention before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure, if I get going--(laugh).
Speaker 1: Probably is, probably a lot of things.
Speaker 2: There's a lot of things, like we've condensed my forty adult years or whatever or thirty-something adult years into three hours.
Speaker 1: Like the Readers Digest version.  But thank you so much for spending time with us.

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, you know, I think about that every once and a while.  The only thing I can think of is similar to what Dr. King [Dr. Martin Luther King] said, I'm not saying this to imitate Dr. King but I think that as a great of person he was he hit the nail on the head.  And I think what I would like to be remembered for most of all was just being a person that was willing and able to help others.  If people, if when my name is mentioned people smile and their heads go up and down then that's all I need.  "He was a good guy, he tried.  I remember him, he was nice, he helped me out."  That is the main thing, I think if people just remember me as somebody that did something good in life, that left something good, then that's all that's necessary.
