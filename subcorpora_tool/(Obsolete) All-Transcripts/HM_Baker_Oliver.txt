Story_ID: 26023
Speaker 1: Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side separately, and then we'll put 'em together.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Yvonne Brigham Baker, my late mother.  She passed away in 2006.  Y-V-O-N-N-E, B-R-I-G-H-A-M.  That was her maiden name.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is her--what was her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Magnolia, Arkansas.  I don't know the date.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't remember the date.
Speaker 1: Okay, was it in the 1930s, you think, or--
Speaker 2: No, it was later than that.  Let's see, I guess she was twenty or twenty-one when I was born so if we work backward from there, yeah, I guess so.  Maybe you're right, '39, 1939, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so circa 1939, we'll just say.  And where--she was born in Magnolia, right--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I believe so, Arkansas, Magnolia, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Right, so my mother's side of the family was really interesting because that was where the intellectuals are in my background.  That's where it started.  My mother's, my grand--my maternal grandfather taught school.  He taught in the--it wasn't a--it was something between a high school and a college.  He taught there in Magnolia, and my grand--my great grandfather, my mother's grandparent, grandfather, I remember her telling me stories about him, how gifted he was in mathematics, how he was so gifted that some of the people at the local college would come by and try to give him problems at the time to try to trip him up, to try to catch him in something he didn't know.  And I always remember one story she told me that there were a group of, a few men that came by one day.  And they gave him a question, a math problem, said--they used to call him, I guess, Professor, I guess, solve this for us.  And he said, okay, I can solve this three different ways.  Which way do you want me to solve it?  And I always, that story always stuck with me.  So, so my--that, and also her aunts.  They got master's degrees back--so they were her aunts. They had master's degrees, so this was in the early nineteenth century.  They, on her daddy's, her father's side.
Speaker 1: This would be in the early 1900s, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, in the early 1900s, exactly.  So they got master's degrees in the subjects that they did.  So this is where, I guess, that part of my background that tended towards, that sort of compelled me to go in the direction that I do, I guess this is where it came from.  My maternal grandmother's side, so they were the Shepherds.  And actually, I take that back.  I think it was on my, it was on my maternal grandmother's side that this came from.  It was my maternal grandmother's sisters and my aunts who were, who got master's degrees, advanced degrees back in the early nineteenth century, long before it became common for African Americans to do so.
Speaker 1: So these would be your great aunts on your--
Speaker 2: That's right, my great aunts, that's right, exactly.
Speaker 1: And so they were the Shepherds or the--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: The Shepherds, okay.
Speaker 2: So my maternal grandmother, her maiden name was Shepherd.  And she married into the Brigham family.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you know the institutions they were associated with in terms of getting their degrees?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  They were in--so my mother and dad met at the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff.  At the time, it was called Arkansas AM and N College in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  And I'm going to assume that at least some of their training took place there at Arkansas AM and N.  Also, my maternal grandfather told me about once when he went to Hampton University in [Hampton] Virginia to take some course, maybe for a year or two.  He took courses for a year or so at Hampton University.  And this must have been in the, I don't know, '20s [1920s] or something, I guess.
Speaker 1: I know in Arkansas, you've got like, I think in Little Rock, it's Philander Smith [College].
Speaker 2: That's right, Philander Smith is in Little Rock, right.
Speaker 1: Another one is Shorter College, which was, may have been more like a junior college in some ways, you know--
Speaker 2: I see.
Speaker 1: --where you could get a "normal degree", which was a teaching degree--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --they had in those days.
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So you were saying your grandfather taught at a school that was a bridge between high school and college?
Speaker 2: That's right, yes, right.
Speaker 1: It may have been--I was thinking maybe Shorter [College] or--
Speaker 2: It was something like that.  But it was in Magnolia [Arkansas], and it was called, what was it called?  I forget.  I forget.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was that kind of a school--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --where you get a normal degree, and--
Speaker 2: That's right, something like that.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, that's easy for someone to look up and--well, it won't be easy--
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --but they can probably find it.
Speaker 2: Sure, you can look it up in Magnolia, Arkansas, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: My maternal grandfather was Williams James Brigham, W. J. Brigham was what they called him, W.J., Williams James Brigham.  These were, and these were some of the more prominent people in their communities, at least that's the way it was told to me.  And even when I visited Magnolia, it confirmed that they were the prominent people in the community, teachers and the people who were educated.  So I was pretty impressed by that.
Story_ID: 26024
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother [Yvonne Brigham] grew up in an atmosphere of learning--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --where learning was stressed and had a--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --her father was, I would think a great mentor in some ways because of his--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --example.
Speaker 2: That's correct, yes.
Speaker 1: So did your mother--now, did she go on to college too?
Speaker 2: She did.  She went to Arkansas AM and N [College, Pine Bluff, Arkansas].  She was a music major, and my mother taught me to play piano when I was young until I got old enough where it wasn't fashionable for a young African American kid to play piano. And then I stopped.  But, yes, she taught me early on.  She was the one that introduced me to music and playing piano, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did your mother have any stories about growing up, about what it was like in that part of the country when she grew up?
Speaker 2: She did.  So, my mother told me that--okay, so there were, she had two sisters.  She was the middle sister, and she was always adventurous from what she told me.  And she was very energetic, and, of course, obviously, very attractive to me and to my dad actually, so.  I do remember her telling me about her love of music and her love of piano.  I also remember her telling me the stories about her grandfather, who--and her parents, and that academic side of the family, and that I guess it had a great influence on me growing up.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she told me about meeting my dad.  She told us about, stories about meeting my dad.
Story_ID: 26025
Speaker 1: Before we get away from your grandfather, are there anymore stories about him?  He seems like quite a personality.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, so my--I never knew, let's see.  So, my maternal granddad was, yeah, so they had a big house by the standards of Magnolia [Arkansas] at the time.  It was a nice, spacious home.  It was a well-manicured property around the home, and my--W.J. Brigham was what we called him, I just, I was always a lot closer to my paternal grandfather.  But, so I never really went to spend long periods of time in Magnolia with my maternal grandfather.  But I did get to know him.  We visited, he visited us a lot when we lived in Arkansas.  I got to know him well.  He was a fun-loving kind of guy.  He liked to, he was a guy who liked to have fun, even at his age.  So I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when do you think he was born?  You think about, around the turn of the century or--
Speaker 2: So, yeah, he must have been in his twenties maybe when my mother was born, so right, probably, right around the turn of the century, I would imagine.  Yeah, he may have been in his late twenties, early thirties when my mother was born.  So, right, somewhere around the turn of the century.
Speaker 1: Around 1910 or so?
Speaker 2: Probably, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 26026
Speaker 1: So your mother [Yvonne Brigham], she went to Arkansas AM and N [Pine Bluff, Arkansas], is that where she met your father?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, we'll just go to your father right now.  Then we'll put 'em together.
Speaker 2: Okay, so my father was--
Speaker 1: Oh, your father's name?
Speaker 2: It's Oliver Walter Baker, O-L-I-V-E-R, W-A-L-T-E-R, B-A-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: My dad grew up in Tillar, Arkansas, down in, near, it's South Central Arkansas, Desha County in Arkansas.
Speaker 1: That's T-I-L-L-E-R?
Speaker 2: T-I-L-L-A-R.
Speaker 1: T-I-L-L-A-R--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Tillar, Arkansas, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And about what year was your dad born?
Speaker 2: About, he was born, I think he was a year older than my mother, so that would have been, yeah, '38 [1938], something--
Speaker 1: Born in 1938, something--
Speaker 2: --late '30s [1930s], I think, somewhere in there, late 1930s.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what can you tell us about his side of the family and what are the stories from that side?
Speaker 2: Right, so my dad's side of the family was, I would characterize it as being, they were industrious.  They worked with their hands.  So my dad grew up on a farm in Arkansas.  His grand--his father, my paternal grandfather was a landowner.  He owned land at the time when it was unusual for an African American farmer to own his own land.  Most of the people were sharecroppers.  They worked for the other large landowners who were obviously not African American.  So, the stories I remember about my dad growing up was that, one, his father, my paternal grandfather, wasn't, didn't receive a lot of formal education, but he emphasized that with his children.  So my dad went off to college and I believe he was the first, he may have been the first in our family to go on and get a degree from Arkansas AM and N, to get a college degree because this, it meant that much to my grand, my paternal grandfather.  In fact, when I was growing up, he used to tell me this all the time, "Get yourself an education," and he emphasized that.  So my dad did that.  I also remember my dad--this is one story I remember from my dad.  When we were small, he bought this set of encyclopedias, right.  And this was a big deal.  Encyclopedias for the salary that he made being a school teacher down in Tillar, [Arkansas] buying a set of encyclopedias, I would say most people probably felt it was a luxury, not necessity.  But he did that, and that had a big impact on my life and that of my brothers and sisters--those of my brothers and sisters as well.  So the story that I remember that we, the encyclopedias had got destroyed.  You know, we just, we just read it so much that the, that it just destroyed 'em.  It wore them out, and how upset he was by that.  He said, you know, I went out and I spent this money to get a nice set of encyclopedias, and now, it's destroyed after so many years.  Well, the thing was, they were destroyed not because we were careful but because they were being used.  We read them all the time.  My younger brother would read, even after I had gone off to college, he--there were passages, long passages in this set of encyclopedias that he had read and had memorized long passages and would tell me about it.  And I remember, you know, doing the same thing when I was younger, as a little boy, and we'd talk about the different parts of this.  So, it wasn't, it wasn't that we destroyed this set of encyclopedias through neglect and abuse.  It was because we actually used them, and, you know, I grew up in a family with nine children.  So, you know, it was a lot of usage.  So I think that had a profound effect on my life, reading, learning and discussing what I read and learned with others, like my brothers and sisters and my parents.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father grew up basically doing agricultural stuff on the farm?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Did your father come out of a large family?
Speaker 2: No, he only, he came out of a small family, one sister and one older brother.  He was the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, his, his--when he was younger, his mom and dad, my paternal grandfather and my paternal grandmother divorced.  And so that side of the family, the--my grandmother went off and remarried and had other children.  So he had brothers and sisters from that marriage.  My grandfather never had other children beyond then, yeah.
Story_ID: 26027
Speaker 1: That's unusual.  So in one sense that your [paternal] grandfather had all that land, and then your--only had a couple of, you know, children and--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and he encouraged them to go off to school (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: I hear a lot of stories where the person's trying to keep the kids on the farm (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --to keep 'em--
Speaker 2: That's right because you need the help, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he was really a visionary--
Speaker 2: He was.
Speaker 1: --in that sense.
Speaker 2: And more than that, you know, there were advantages that came to landowners that my dad [Oliver Walter Baker] used--my granddad used to help other African Americans in that community.  So, for example, if you were a landowner, you could, you know, there were just, there were just advantages that came to you, banking and selling your crops in a different, to different--so, if you, for example, if you were, if you raised cotton, and you wanted to sell the cotton or let's say if you were a sharecropper, and you didn't own the land, but you had some cotton that you came by that you wanted to sell, you had to be a landowner to take it to the machinery.  I guess it was called the "Gin" at the time, to sell it.  My granddad would help other African American farmers in this way because he was the landowner.  And because of that prominence he had in the community being a landowner, he was able to help raise the entire community in the way that he did.  I wouldn't say that he was a large landowner by any means, but what he did was of help to other African Americans in the community because (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure this.  So, if you brought cotton in, and they knew you didn't own the land, the suspicion would be if they paid--they wouldn't give you the money because they figured the money should go to whoever owned the--
Speaker 2: I don't know the details.
Speaker 1: No, not exactly (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: I don't know the details.  I just remember, in general terms, him telling me that he was able to help other African Americans, other farmers in the vicinity--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just wondered if it was to prevent sharecroppers from selling cotton without the landowner knowing about it or something, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah, possibly, I don't know.  I don't know the details.
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Story_ID: 26028
Speaker 1: So, and my paternal grandfather, his father apparently was a minister, a Baptist preacher because I don't know that much about him.  My granddad would tell me that they used to call him "Preacher".  He was a Baptist minister.  And he told me that he died in some kind of an accident.  I remember him telling me that, that he died in some kind of a carriage accident of some sort.  And on my paternal grandmother's side, so the, the--my dad's [Oliver Walter Baker] mother, I didn't get to know too well.  She moved up to Michigan, to Michigan, and I went to visit her a few times.  She would come to visit after, after she and my granddad got divorced.  So I got to know her.  I got to know my aunts relatively well.  But it was more my step-grandmother that I got to know really well.  Every since I was a little boy, she was like a mother to me.  So she was working on, with my granddad and, on the farm.  And then, so my, so my step-grandmother, Hazel Baker, she became a store owner.  And my granddad and her built a store together, right there on Highway 65 in Desha County in Arkansas.  And this became "the" most successful black business in the entire state.  She won an award for having the most successful black business in the entire state.  This was after I had gone off to college that she won the award.  But even as a boy, I saw the hard work that she and my granddad put into it.  He, on the farm, and her, in this general store.  And I saw, I saw their hard work, their dedication, you know, every single day she was there, tired, sick, it didn't matter.  The same with him, every single day, there was something to be done.  And, and, you know, they enjoyed it.  That was the thing.  It wasn't a chore.  They didn't complain.  They enjoyed doing what they did, so.
Speaker 2: Now, is this like what you see in the movies as a general store, where--
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: --you can get pretty much--
Speaker 1: It was a general store, that's right.  So it sold everything that that community needed and more than that.  So, so this was the front part--so the store had two parts. The front part was the general store, and this was groceries.  It also had, this part of the store had, yeah, meat and, and whatever else, food items.  In the back of the store was an area for farmers to bring their crops and sort them and then to sell them, to put them in the right packages to sell them.  So, for example, cucumbers.  I remember there was a sorter in the back of the store where you could--the farmers would bring in big loads, truckloads of cucumbers.  And this sorter would sort them into size, according to size, put them in baskets, according to size.  And then they could take them wherever they needed to go to sell them.  So for a nominal fee, my grandparents did that as well for farmers.  There were other things, not just cucumbers.  That was just one example.  So this was in the back of the store, and there was also feed for animals that were sold from the back of the store.  So, this was a big enterprise by the standards of their day.  This was a big business.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  What was the name of the store?  Did they have a--
Speaker 1: Jolly Baker's Grocery, J-O-L-L-Y, Jolly Baker's Grocery.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I remember Jolly because my granddad's name was John Baker and people called him Johnny, and they called it "Jolly".  So that was one question.  Why did you name it Jolly Baker 's instead of Johnny Baker and then second, you know, this was a business, a store that lasted for decades.  And you can imagine that over the course of decades, there would be some mishaps, disasters.  So I remember when I was in school, once, it was a bad winter.  And there was a snow and ice storm that caused part of the roof to cave in.  And I remember the kids at school asking me, well, I guess your grandparents aren't so "jolly" now, right? So, it was a joke, yeah, but, anyway, yeah, Jolly Baker's Grocery.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 26029
Speaker 1: Alright, now, let's see, so your father [Oliver Walter Baker] grew up in--did he have any stories to tell about growing up in that part of Arkansas [Tillar, Desha County, Arkansas]?
Speaker 2: He did, of course, obviously.  So he told me stories about doing well in school.  He told me stories about what it was like to go off to college for the first time.  The other--so one of the stories that--so this wasn't a story, but one of the things I remember about my dad, an interaction I had with my dad was, I was a little boy.  I must have just started school.  So he asked me once, he said, if I throw a, if I'm riding along in a car, and I throw the ball out of the window, what does the ball do?  Does it go forward?  Does it go to, does it go straight out of the window or does it go backwards?  And as a little boy, I said, okay, it goes backwards.  And he had to explain to me, no, it doesn't.  It appears to go backwards to you, but actually, it's going forward because it has a certain momentum because you're riding along in the car, and you throw it out, and it's gonna make it go forward.  But if you're riding along in the car, it makes it look like it's going backwards.  So I remembered that.  That stuck with me, and I had to go off and ponder and think about it and learn about it.  So it was these kind of things now that, that was the kind of interaction I had with my parents.  I also remember my dad and mother [Yvonne Brigham]--again, they met in college, so I think my mother took French.  My dad took German, and I remember them having German and French books in the house.  They had some of their college books in the house, and occasionally, they would tell us phrases in these, in other languages.  So, right, so, yes, my mom and dad--the other thing, from an early age, my mom and dad, no matter what or how busy they were or what was going on, every Friday night, we had a family get-together.  And it wasn't just on Friday nights.  We were always together.  We would eat together.  We would laugh, talk, play together, but every Friday night, we would all gather in the living room, and he would read to us.  He would just read stories to us, not long, but, you know, maybe thirty minutes.  And then we'd have a treat afterward, ice cream or something.  But this was another thing my dad did.  So--
Speaker 1: Now, that's interesting.  So every Friday night--
Speaker 2: Every Friday night.  That's correct--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no matter what.  Even if he was tired.  I know, looking back, as an adult myself, I know there were times that he was just (laughter) worn out, just ready to collapse, but he would always take the time to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so do you think his father influenced him to do those kinds of things and--
Speaker 2: He would tell me that his father--so one of the stories, so--again, there were lots of stories, but here's another one.  So, how did my granddad become a landowner?  Dad used to tell me, and my granddad told me, that before he became a landowner, my dad was a little boy.  And he called my dad and his brother and his sister in and said, look, I'm gonna have to go off to California for a while.  He had to go work on the shipyards to make money.  And there was, that was a, I guess that was good pay at the time.  So I think that affected my dad.  He said that his dad, my paternal grandfather told him, now, you're gonna have to be the man of the house.  You're gonna have to be a man now, even though he was a little boy, because I'm gonna be away for awhile.  My granddad went out to California, I think to the Bay area, Oakland, worked on the shipyards, made enough money to come back and then buy land.  And that's how he became a landowner.  My granddad, my dad told me that and what that meant to him, how, you know, he had to grow up really fast.  He would tell me other stories about how my granddad, because of his being a landowner and his prominence, his influence in the community, how he was able to help other African Americans.  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26030
Speaker 1: Did he [Baker's father, Oliver Walter Baker] have any stories of racism in Arkansas in those days?
Speaker 2: The thing I remember about that aspect of his stories was that he would always emphasize that we were not to--that was not to be a big part of our lives.  He would not let us watch shows that, on television, that had a lot of--where that was the storyline.  So first of all, we didn't own a television when I was younger.  We didn't, we just, for whatever reason, did not own a television until I was older.  I was a teenager when we got our, a television in the house.  But even then, so during the '70s [1970s], there were some shows that, that was the storyline, racism and what--the relationship between African Americans and other races and other cultures.  And if it, if it had a tone to it that emphasized racism, he wouldn't--we just didn't watch those shows.  He did not let that be a big part of our lives and our upbringing.  He and my mother made sure that we didn't dwell on that.  This was not a, this was not a big deal in my growing up.  Of course, it was there.  This was, at the time, in that part of the South, there was racism, and, of course, it touched us.  But we came beyond that.  So here's another story.  So, there was what was called Tillar High School at the time.  It was called Tillar High, but it went grades one through twelve.  And then, maybe a mile or two down the road, there was another school called, I think it was called Pruett, B.C. Pruett, I guess it was called.  So all of the African American kids went to B.C. Pruett, and all of the white, young kids went to Tillar High School.  So my oldest sister, who's a year older than me, it was her class that the, that there was integration.  I guess it was mandated by the state [of Arkansas] or just that community decided to do it.  I don't remember which.  So I was too young to remember it at the time, but I remember--as I got a little older, I remember some of the stories that my dad told me, this story about--.  So my oldest sister was gonna be among the first who was gonna be--that class was the first to be a part of this integration where some of the young African Americans students and children from this part of the community were gonna be sent to this, what was called the "white school," Tillar High School because that's where all the white students went.  And nobody knew how this was gonna work out.  This was the first time that it was gonna happen.  So my dad told me stories about some of his buddies had came by and talked to him and say, you know, (unclear) "I'm gonna follow your daughter there and if anybody looks at her, even looks at her in the wrong way, I'm gonna take 'em out," you know.  And my dad was telling 'em, "Naw, we're not gonna do that, you know.  We're gonna handle this responsibly."  He also told me about their community, the way the community leaders handled it.  They, it was a really responsible way.  So what they did was, they brought all of the white parents together and talked to them and said, this is what's gonna happen.  You know, we're not gonna have any mess.  We're gonna make this work and answered questions from the community, the white community.  Then they brought the black community in, separately, like a day later and had the same conversations with them.  We're going to make this work, and these are young children, and we're going to make sure that there's no mess, nobody's gonna be injured and answered questions.  And then they brought both communities together, and the white and the blacks, and, and then had the conversation with them as a whole and answered questions as a whole.  And it went off really well.  It went off really well, which is to their credit because there were problems in other parts of Arkansas, as you probably know, in Little Rock and Pine Bluff.  But it did not happen in that little community where we were.  There was, there were, obviously, there were growing pains.  We had to get used to each other, but there was not this kind of violence and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that the other parts of the state experienced.
Story_ID: 26031
Speaker 1: Okay, so, you know, one of the things I've heard from people, and actually read too, was that the reason why Little Rock [Arkansas] was integrated, race--was because it was a softer kind of segregation than it was in some of the other cities down South.  You know, though, that comes as a surprise to a lot of people.  They think that they--when we, you know, think about all the stuff that happened there, you know, the horrible stuff that happened, but it would have been worse in other places.  That's what the thought was on some level.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh (nodding).
Speaker 1: --'cause the strength of the black community in Little Rock and in your community, in Tillar [Arkansas], it seems as though, you know, you've got really a strong, black community and--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and strong leadership on the white side.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --to make sure that it worked.
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: So, now, let me ask you this.  We were, let me go back and find out how your parents [Yvonne Brigham and Oliver Walter Baker] met.  Now, they met at a school, at University of Arkansas, Pine Bluff--
Speaker 2: Arkansas AM and N.
Speaker 1: Arkansas A and M in those days--
Speaker 2: Right, AM and N, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, yeah, it's A, M and N, right.
Speaker 2: Right, Arkansas AM and N, yeah, Agriculture, Mechanical and Normal, I guess, it was called.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.  So, is there a story about how they met and fell in love or--
Speaker 2: Yes, so, the story that came to me, I guess, from both of them, was that my dad worked in the cafeteria.  He, to help pay for his school, he worked in the cafeteria, and my mother would come there, obviously, to eat, and I guess they flirted with each other.  And then, you know, they started to like each other, and then, yeah, it went from there, so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is some time in the late '50s [1950s], I guess?
Speaker 2: Probably, right, right, mid to late '50s [1950s], right, exactly, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 26032
Speaker 1: So when you think about your parents' personalities, and you think about their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they look, how they walk, talk, interact with people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother [Yvonne Brigham], easily.  Yeah, I take after my mother.  I get my personality from her.  She was a, she was--my mother, okay.  I'm not a carbon copy, but she was the, she was energetic and vivacious, and she was fun-loving.  And I think that she would, I guess, you know, in a fun-loving, in a romantic kind of way, maybe she was a little aggravating to my dad [Oliver Walter Baker], who I think was a bit more serious at the time.  But, yeah, I get my personality more from my mother than from my dad, yep, and she was, she also was--I think it's fair to say that she cared very deeply about her family, her children and her husband.  And I think that I'm the same way, so--not that my dad didn't.  I think at that time, the culture, the culture at that time in the African American community, the father was meant to be more, was meant to be more serious, I guess.  And I suppose, being an African American male in the South at the time, I just think that there were pressures everywhere on African American men.  And I remember my dad was very tough.  He was a tough man, and at the same time, and so, my mother had her toughness as well.  But I think that she was the one who would get out in the yard and play with us and, you know, play games, and she was the one who would crack jokes to us and stuff.  So, yeah.
Story_ID: 26033
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now, you've got nine--
Speaker 2: There were nine of us, right, there were nine of us.
Speaker 1: Can you name your brothers and sisters and put yourself in order for us?
Speaker 2: Of course, my oldest sister is Bridgette Baker Dancy, married to James Dancy in Houston [Texas].  There's myself and my lovely wife, Beretta, and our two daughters here in Connecticut.  I have a younger brother after me, James Wesley Baker.  He lives in Little Rock [Arkansas].  My brother next to him is Tony Erwin Baker.  He lives in Beaumont, Texas, he and his wife, Ruth.  And then after him, there's Christopher Charles Baker who lives in Tillar [Arkansas] with his wife, Diane.  And then after him, there is Sharon Baker Stanford.  She and her husband, David, live in Greenville, North Carolina.  Then after that, there's Connie Baker Smith.  She and her husband, Ronnie, live in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.  And there's Angela, my youngest sister, Angela and her husband.  They live--Ronnie, they live in Greenville, North Carolina, and then there's John Mark Baker and his wife, Nicola and their family.  They live in California in the Bay Area.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so this is a pretty big household and--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --so did you have a big house or--
Speaker 2: It wasn't, it was adequate.  It wasn't large.  We had to share bedrooms, if that's what you meant.  The boys in one bedroom, the girls in another bedroom, and my oldest sister, as she got older, she had her own bedroom.  I remember that, but, and then my parents [Yvonne Brigham and Oliver Walter Baker] had their bedroom, so yeah, it was, it was adequate, large enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26034
Speaker 1: Now, can you describe the--now, did you grow up in the country or in the town?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so we lived in this little farming community, Tillar [Arkansas], up until I graduated, I finished the fifth grade.  And then we moved to Memphis, Tennessee, and lived in that city until I graduated from high school.  So Memphis, obviously, is a large, metropolitan area, a city, compared to Tillar and Reed which are small, farming communities.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in Tillar, was there a name for your community, the community you lived in?
Speaker 2: Reed, it was called Reed.  That's where the, most of the African Americans lived in this section called Reed.
Speaker 1: Okay, was Reed the name of a street or--
Speaker 2: It was the name of the community, the township, R-E-E-D, Reed, Reed, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so can you describe some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Sure, it was a farming community in Reed.  So, so tractors--I learned to drive a tractor, believe it or not--I'm full disclosure.  I learned to drive a tractor before I learned to drive anything else.  I was a little boy, helping my granddad on the farm.  He owned the farm at the time, and I remember helping to, to collect the hay for this livestock.  So he would grow his own hay.  They would cut it.  It would dry, and then they'd form it into bales, and so I was a little boy, and I was too small for my feet to even reach the gears down there, you know, the, the accelerator and the clutch.  So what they would do is, my dad [Oliver Walter Baker] and my granddad would put me on the seat, and they would get the tractor pulling the trailer in the back, they would get it pointed in the direction.  And then they'd let me drive it, right.  So I was a little boy, driving like this or I thought I was driving it, but I was just steering it.  And then as it got to the end of the row, and needed to turn around, they would run and jump up on the tractor and turn it around and get it pointed in the other direction.  And then they'd give it to me again.  And there I'd go.  So I learned to do that, and then as I got older, my, as I grew, my feet were able--my legs were long enough for my feet to reach the clutch.  And then I learned how to drive a standard shift tractor, and then I learned how to drive a standard shift truck, with the column steering, where you had to (laughter) [makes cracking noise], do that.  And then, I learned how to drive an automatic shift car.  So, yeah, that's how I--and so, yeah, tractors, combines, cotton pickers, you know, being on a--working on the farm.  We didn't live on the farm, but my, my brothers and sisters and I lived in that little township, but we'd obviously, go the few miles to my granddad's farm and help work on the farm.  So even after I got older, even after we moved to Memphis, in the summers, my dad and mother would send us back, send my brothers and me back to work on the farm in Arkansas, even after we had moved, to teach us, I guess, the value of hard work, I guess.
Speaker 1: Now, did you look forward to going back to the farm?
Speaker 2: Sure, sure.  I did, I, I enjoyed it.  I had lots of friends there, having grown up there.  I enjoyed working with my, my granddad.  He was just a wonderful guy.  I just really enjoyed it.  So, yeah, sure, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Any other sights and sounds and smells?
Speaker 2: So then there was Memphis.  So Memphis was, again, to me, and it still is, it's just a wonderful city, and so going to junior high school or middle school.  We called it junior high school and then high school in Memphis, I remember some of the sights and sounds just had to do with my friends and I doing what young, high school students do, hanging out.  I didn't hang out as much perhaps as some of my others.  I remember, especially after I got to be a junior and a senior in high school, I would--once my classes ended, I would go to the library and do extra reading so that--because I guess I just enjoyed it.  I remember enjoying it.  So, for example, calculus wasn't taught in my high school, but I went to the library and I'd start--even in high school, I'd start reading what I could understand about calculus.  I didn't understand a lot.  It was over my head, but I do remember picking up some books on calculus and reading at least parts of it, the part that was in English (laughter).  So, Memphis was, yeah, there was the traffic.  There was, there were the, you know, the sports and lots of, lots of people, lots, lots of people compared to what it was in Arkansas.
Story_ID: 26035
Speaker 1: Did you live in North Memphis [Tennessee] or--
Speaker 2: We lived in, at the time, it was called Chickasaw Hills.  It was called the Indian Hills, it was called Indian Hills part of Memphis.  That's where I graduated--we stayed there for a while, and then we moved to, yeah, I guess it was sort of North Memphis.  It was near, it was closer to downtown.  My dad [Oliver Walter Baker] wanted to be closer to his job.  So that's where I lived for a while and graduated from high school there.
Speaker 1: What high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I graduated from Messick High School.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Messick was closed down a few years after I graduated.
Speaker 1: Is it M-E--
Speaker 2: M-E-S-S-I-C-K.
Speaker 1: --I-C-K.
Speaker 2: Right, so I went to Westwood High School for one year, and then we moved, and I went to, I graduated from Messick High School, which since has been closed down.
Speaker 1: I just wanted to get the name of it, and I'm gonna go back to grade school.  Now, where did you--what was the name of your grade school in Tillar [Arkansas], I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.  So I went to Tillar High School--
Speaker 1: I mean the grade school.  What was the grade school there?
Speaker 2: It was called Tillar--
Speaker 1: Tillar High School?
Speaker 2: Tillar High School.  It was grades one through twelve.  But it was called Tillar High School.
Speaker 1: Now, that's something that always throws me off.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, (unclear) (simultaneous)--you have to try to explain--
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, they do that down South (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they do.  So I went there, Tillar--
Speaker 1: Tillar High School, but you went to grade school there.
Speaker 2: That's right, I went to grade school there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: First through, the first through fifth grade, the first through fourth grade, I was at Tillar High School.  For the fifth grade, I went to B.C. Pruitt School, elementary school.
Speaker 1: Now, was Tillar High School, now, was this like, was it called Tillar Colored High School or Tillar--
Speaker 2: No, just-- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --just Tillar High School.
Speaker 2: --Tillar High School, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, because the other school, I mean the high school that was all white was, was that Tillar?
Speaker 2: That's right.  So Tillar from the first through the twelfth grade was essentially all white until my oldest sister, the year she started school, and then--
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --they integrated it.
Speaker 1: So you went to an integrated school?
Speaker 2: That's right, it was integrated when I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And B.C. Pruitt was most--it was still mostly African American students at B.C. Pruitt.  I don't remember.  There may have been one or two white students that went there.  But I, I wanted to go there in my fifth grade.  I, I went there for the fifth grade, and then the summer after the fifth grade, we moved to Memphis, and I went to Volentine Elementary School for my sixth grade education in Memphis, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: So Valentine?
Speaker 2: Volentine--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: V-O-L--
Speaker 2: V-O-L-E-N-T-I-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, Volentine, okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a reason that you wanted to go to B.C. Pruitt at the--
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, so--
Speaker 1: --back in Tillar?
Speaker 2: So, even though the schools were integrated, Tillar became an integrated school in, I guess, '58 [1958], some--I'm sorry, not '58 [1958].  It must have been '60 [1960]--it was in the early '60s [1960s].  Most of my friends in that small community, Reed, who were obviously, African Americans still went to B.C. Pruitt.  A lot of us, there were a fair number, a good number that went to Tillar, to this integrated school.  But most of the blacks went still to B.C. Pruitt, and so at that age, you know, these are my friends, these are the guys I ran with, and they went to Pruitt, and I wanted to go there.  So, I went there my fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was, again, mostly African American students and teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, now, in Tillar, did you have black teachers at Tillar High School?
Speaker 2: I did not.  I did not.  I had, I only had white teachers, just, just really, just wonderful teachers.  Mrs. Hail, Mrs. Sandifer, Mrs. Rogers, Mrs., Mr. Walton, just wonderful teachers.  Mrs. Hail, my first-grade teacher, just--for whatever reason, she just, she made it a point to, to teach me to, to put me in positions of responsibility.  If it was time to go out for recess, she'd say, okay, everybody put your heads on your desk, and I'll call you and let you know when you can go out for recess.  And I was always the first one she'd call on, and if there was something that needs to be done, like a fire marshal or something for the first grade, she'd make sure that I was one of them.  And I did really well in her, in her, in the first grade, obviously, and I guess that meant a lot to her.  But it wasn't, it wasn't so much my performance.  It was just, she was just a wonderful person, a white woman, wonderful person.  And I had other teachers the same way.
Story_ID: 26036
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself in grade school?  What were you like?
Speaker 2: Studious, studious.  My mom [Yvonne Brigham] and dad [Oliver Walter Baker] made sure that--I had fun, I had fun with my friends, but I think that they, they carried it to a level that I just didn't.  They carried the fun and playing to a level that I didn't.  So, yeah, studious, probably.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so did you do a lot of reading at home?
Speaker 2: I did, I did, reading the encyclopedias and, of course, reading the books that I had in my classes.  So, yeah, yeah, lots of reading.
Speaker 1: Okay, I would think so, now, with on television, you probably got a lot of reading done, you know--
Speaker 2: That's right, yep.  We didn't have a television in the house until I became, I think I was--I don't know how old I was.  It seems like I was a teenager before we had a television in the house.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you have a library card at that age?
Speaker 2: I didn't have a library card, but we had books in the house, and then there were books in the library at school.  So I could get those, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and when you went through the encyclopedia, did you have a favorite subject in the encyclopedia?
Speaker 2: I did.  So there was, there was an article on--this is interesting.  It compared living in the city versus living in a rural area, living in an urban versus a rural area and some of the advantages to both.  And I remember reading that a lot.  I remember reading that article a lot.  There was, there was an article in this encyclopedia about how to make a musical instrument using a twig, a branch from a tree, and I remember trying to do that, trying to make a musical instrument.  And--
Speaker 1: What kind of instrument was it?
Speaker 2: It was like a, I don't know, a flute, a woodwind instrument or something.
Speaker 1: It never worked, but I followed the instructions in the encyclopedia.  That was a big deal.  There was, there was some article, I think, in there about a telescope.  And I remember, and I remember trying to build a telescope.  And I actually, so, yeah, so I made this, this, what I thought was a clean room at the time.  It wasn't a real clean room.  I was able to work and save up enough money to buy the powder so I could grind the lenses. I bought the lenses.  I ground them and in this--it wasn't, it wasn't a clean room after all.  But I thought it was at the time.  And in the end, I did not get the telescope finished because I needed a magnifier.  So the lenses that collected the light, I ground them and I thought that was done well, but the actual magnifying lens costs too much money.  And so I wasn't able to get enough money to buy it.  But that was an experience I--and encyclopedias helped.  So, yeah, so.
Story_ID: 26037
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, now, did you have a radio at the house?
Speaker 2: Yes, we did.  So the experience with the radio, I remember when the moon landing happened.  We didn't have a television, and I couldn't watch the moon landing, but when was that, '69 [1969], '70 [1970]?  I listened to it on the radio.
Speaker 1: 1969.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: July the 20th.  Now, this is--
Speaker 2: July, 1969.
Speaker 1: Near your birthday.
Speaker 2: That's right, exactly.  So I remember listening to it on the radio, yep.
Speaker 1: You'd have been about ten--
Speaker 2: Something like that, yeah, that's right.
Speaker 1: And so were you fascinated by that?
Speaker 2: I was, yeah, definitely.
Speaker 1: Did you go outside and look at the moon (laughter)?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Eventually, I'm sure I did.  I, yes, I remember this was a big deal.  This was, I was fascinated by it, and then there were the conversations that different people in the community had.  Some people didn't, felt like they didn't go to the moon, that they staged this.  This was something that happened in the desert in the Southwest.
Speaker 1: My grandmother said that she walked on her porch, she said, I don't see anybody up there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And it was kind of, you know, but that's the kind of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, things in these small communities, you hear all the--my family never engaged in that.  They--we always just felt like, yeah, they landed on the moon.  This is a big deal.  You bet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26038
Speaker 1: So your science teachers in grade school were, until you got to [B.C.] Pruitt [High School]--now, was there a difference in Tillar [High School] and Pruitt when you got there [in Tillar, Arkansas]?  Had they made them actually about the same in terms of their equipment and what they were able to do?
Speaker 2: They were.  I remember when I got to Pruitt, I--the one year I spent there, the teachers were just outstanding.  They were just great teachers, and that's when I had my first African American teachers.  And I don't even remember the names.  But the math teacher I had was just, he was just a great person, smart, focused, and I've forgotten his name.  And then, just having other teachers at Pruitt that were African American--at the time, I don't know if it, if I realized the effect that it had, but it was, it was a good feeling, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26039
Speaker 1: Now, was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Definitely.  We went to church.  At the time, we went to church on Saturday.  It was a non-denominational church, Worldwide Church of God, and I still go to that.  It's name has changed.  It's gone through a transition now from what it was, as I believe all good, healthy churches do.  You change, you grow, you learn and you act on what you learn.  So it's now called Grace Communion International, and I'm still a member, right?  I was baptized into the church, that church that, that denomination, that congregation in California when I was a graduate student and have continued to this day.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is a denomination that, I haven't heard a lot about it, but it's called the--
Speaker 2: It's now called Grace Communion--
Speaker 1: Grace Communion, okay.
Speaker 2: --International.  At the time, it was called the Worldwide Church of God.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did, were there activities for youth in church?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.  That's where I played basketball.  I played on the basketball team and there were others.  There was track and field.  There were, there were other activities having to do with the arts.  I played piano in church.  I played a solo only once--or maybe twice.  I wasn't a regular performer, but in high school, I played, so, right.  And I played a lot of basketball with my friends in the church.
Speaker 1: Did they have a proper gym there and everything?
Speaker 2: We would use other gyms.  They didn't have their own gym.  We didn't have a building.  We rented, rented churches or rented, met in schools at times.  So we used those facilities.
Speaker 1: Okay, now did they have Boy Scouts and Cub Scouts and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I never joined the Boy Scouts or Cub Scouts.  I was never a part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so the church was on Saturdays.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And would it be all day on Saturday or--
Speaker 2: No, it would be in the mornings--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --mainly, I remember, well, okay, so some congregations--so we moved a bit.  So we moved, we were part of it in Arkansas.  My parents started attending when I was a boy in Arkansas, and that met in the morning.  Then when we moved to Memphis [Tennessee], that congregation met in the afternoons, but it wasn't an all-day church, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a few hours every Saturday, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, okay, so this is a--was the church predominantly a black congregation?
Speaker 2: No, it was, it was mixed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was, the church in Little Rock [Arkansas], when I was a little boy was mostly white, but there were a fair number of African American black families.  The church in Memphis was more evenly distributed between blacks and whites.  And then when I went to California, it was, when I went off to college--and when I went to college in Massachusetts, I didn't go to church as often.  After all, I was on my own for the first time, so, but I remember there being--it was pretty integrated the times that I went.  And then when I went off to California, it was fairly integrated.  Most, still I think, mostly white, but a fair number of blacks, right, African Americans.
Speaker 1: Now, this seems, you know, this seems, this is unusual for Arkansas, but it's even unusual for almost any part of the country because people have noticed that church is the most segregated hour, you know--
Speaker 2: That's right, yep.
Speaker 1: --in America.
Speaker 2: I think Billy Graham [American Christian evangelist, ordained as a Southern Baptist minister] said it right (laughter).
Speaker 1: And it really is.
Speaker 2: It is, that's right.
Speaker 1: So, and people actually have a choice, you know, when they go to--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --church, you know, on some level.
Speaker 2: That's correct, that is correct.
Speaker 1: But this is an integrated so it is unusual--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in that respect.
Speaker 2: It was, I agree.  And as I said, you know, to my parents' [Yvonne Brigham and Oliver Walter Baker] credit, if we, if were, I would say--okay, so, there were issues.  There were racial issues at the time, and we worked through them.  We got, you know, we're still working through them, but the ones that existed at that time, we worked through them, and now, we're dealing with the ones that exist now.  But my parents never let racism become a big part of our lives, the discussions of racism, what had happened in the past and we were aware of it.  They made us aware of it, but not in the sense of--I would say they did not let the belligerence, the anger that I would say touched some of my friends, I think my parents made it a point not to let that dominate my thinking about racism; recognize it, go forward.
Story_ID: 26040
Speaker 1: Now, you grew up during, and I don't know if it, how much of the news reached you, but you grew up during the Black Power era.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you were--
Speaker 2: That was the point.
Speaker 1: --born in '59 [1959]--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --by the time you were five, you know, Stokely Carmichael proclaimed "black power" on the march from Selma to Montgomery [Alabama]--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and people started talking about it.  And there were like, the national dialogue around race, became violent at certain points at the, in the late '60s [1960s], riots in major cities and--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --you know, confrontations around different issues--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --and changes actually in the way people operated based on these, you know, the push, you know.  So--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I owe a lot to my parents [Yvonne Brigham and Oliver Walter Baker] for--my parents didn't shield me from that.  They didn't shield me from what was going on in the larger community, but they taught us, my brothers and sisters and myself, how to put it in perspective and how to go forward dealing with it.  There were times--so one story my dad told me was, okay, in those days in Arkansas, if you were a black male, and you had to go to a white person's house, you couldn't go to the front door and knock on the front door.  You had to go around to the back, right?  And I remember once my dad and my mother told me this story about a white gentleman that came to our house.  He needed something.  And my dad, you gotta go around to the back.  I'm not gonna talk to you through my front door.  And I'm not sure what context they put that story in, but I do remember--I'm just trying to paint a picture.  They didn't shield us from the discussions about racism, what was going on in the larger community, but my parents did talk to us in a way that we were able to put it in perspective.  So, you know, my granddaddy was a landowner.  My mother, my grandmother was a business person.  And they were just tremendously successful at doing that.  And part of the reason they were successful was, let's just face it, all right.  You gotta work with the larger community of people if you want to be, achieve success at that level.  And so you need to put these things in perspective and find a way to go forward.  That was the thing that I think my parents and grandparents taught me.
Speaker 1: Yeah, in terms of suppliers, you had, if you have a black business, you are gonna have to go through some white suppliers.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And if you wanna sell your product that you've raised on the farm, that you grow, you're gonna have to deal with it, right, the majority--the wider population and culture.  So, put these things in perspective.  Don't, don't be naive, but don't let it consume you.  Don't let the racism consume you, I think was the thing that I would--that's the way I'm characterizing it now when explaining it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26041
Speaker 1: Now, how did your family's move to Memphis [Tennessee] take place?  What was the cause of that?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I just remembered when we were in the fifth grade, my parents calling and saying we're going to Memphis.  And, you know, I--that was the extent of it.  I don't know why.  We moved to Memphis.  It was a good time in my life.
Speaker 1: So your father, I suppose he had a job in Memphis.
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: He had already lined something up before--
Speaker 2: We had a--, my aunt and uncle, my mother's sister, my aunt lived in Memphis with her husband.  And I think they helped my dad to get a job in Memphis.  So, yes, he got a job there.  We moved to Memphis, and that's where we stayed until I graduated from high school.  And then I think maybe a few years after I graduated from high school, my parents, my family moved back to Arkansas.  And that's where they remained.  So my dad still lives there.  My mother passed away a few years ago, and they all lived in Arkansas, yep.
Story_ID: 26042
Speaker 1: Your parents [Yvonne Brigham and Oliver Walter Baker] move to Memphis [Tennessee].  They didn't explain to you why they had to move to--
Speaker 2: They may have, but it wasn't, wasn't a big deal.  It was no big deal to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is in 1969?
Speaker 2: Something like that, right.
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. [Martin Luther] King had just been assassinated.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: In Memphis--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --and there was a lot of national focus on Memphis.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your dad do for a living there in Memphis?
Speaker 2: So, in Memphis, he worked at a television station, WHBQ, Channel 13 at the time.  He was a, he was--it was something, they called it the Traffic Controller or something, but he scheduled the, the shows.  He was the one that, I guess, he had some position scheduling the television shows at WHBQ.
Speaker 1: WHPQ?
Speaker 2: "B."
Speaker 1: BQ, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: WHBQ, it's like barbeque, BQ (laughter).
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Okay, I remember one of the features of Memphis in those days was 'Loeb's Laundromat and Barbeque'.
Speaker 2: That's right, yeah.  That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: A sign of a pig on the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, and there was Stacks and Volt was a big recording company at the time, Isaac Hayes--
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --Elvis, they were all, you know, this was that time.  Yeah, this was a great--Al Green was a big deal then, and this was a great time in Memphis, yep.
Speaker 1: Now, did you live near the business district where some of these--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --activities took place?
Speaker 2: No, so we lived out in, it was Indian Hills.  It was out in--what part of Memphis was it?  I guess, I guess it was South Memphis.  And we lived there for a few years, and then my dad, to move closer to WHBQ, to the studio, we moved closer to the downtown area.  But I guess it was still--yeah, it was closer to the downtown area, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he worked downtown basically--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --for this station?  So he would schedule the programs.  He was a program scheduler?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's what I remember.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, now, and you went to school, there you went to--
Speaker 2: I started out at Volentine Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One year there, and then we went--, then I went to Lanier Junior High School, Lanier.  The junior high school at that time was sixth--I'm sorry, seventh, eighth and ninth grade.  And so from Lanier, I graduated from Lanier--I mean I finished at Lanier, and then went to Westwood High School for one year.
Speaker 1: Now, what was educational, what was it like at Volentine, first of all?  Were you ahead of the other students or behind them--
Speaker 2: I don't remember being--
Speaker 1: --or about the same?
Speaker 2: --ahead or behind.  I just remember, it wasn't, it wasn't, for whatever reason, it just wasn't the best year of my elementary school experience.  I don't remember details.  I just remember that.  Maybe it was because I missed my friends in Arkansas.  It was a new community.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you like Memphis?
Speaker 2: I liked Memphis.  I grew to really like Memphis.  By the time I left to go off to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I just loved Memphis, right, right.  So after Volentine [Elementary School], we went to, I went to Lanier High School, junior high school, and then to Westwood High School for one year, the tenth grade, and then to Messick High School.  That was when my parents moved to be closer, so my dad could be closer to his job.  We moved to another part of Memphis, and I went to Messick High School for the eleventh and twelfth grade.  And that's where I graduated.
Story_ID: 26043
Speaker 1: So your grades [at Messick High School, Memphis, Tennessee], I take it were really good?
Speaker 2: They were good, yes.  I was not at the top of my class.  I didn't graduate valedictorian or salutatorian.  But my grades were good, yes, and I did, I did really well on standardized tests.  And that was the thing.  So my grades were good, I did well on standardized tests, and--
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers or mentors along the way, between--
Speaker 2: Oh, several of them.  I had really good teachers, every step of the way.  And being a studious, young, African American who had the parents [Yvonne Brigham and Oliver Walter Baker] that I did and the family structure that I did, as a professor now, I'm, I tend to pay particular attention to those kind of students myself, the ones that you can just tell that these students are serious.  These are the ones that are gonna go ahead.  And there are lots of them here at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  I mean it's just, some of these students here are so good, it's frightening.  I think that because I was like that as a student in the sense that I took the studies seriously, I think the student--the teachers appreciated that.  And so they would go out of their way to give me that extra mentoring and teaching and so, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you really focused on science as a--
Speaker 2: I did, I was.  I remember being eleven or twelve years old reading about physics in my granddad--in my dad's, in my parents' encyclopedias.  I read about science.  I read about physics and just being, just in love with it from an early age.  So by the time I got on into junior high and high school, yes, I just loved science, and this is what I wanted to do.  I loved physics.
Story_ID: 26044
Speaker 1: Now, was your grandfather still alive, was your mother's [Yvonne Brigham] father still alive when you were going to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And he was quite a mathematician you were saying?
Speaker 2: That's right.  My great, great grandfather was the one who was really a great mathematician.  My mother's grandfather, my, he was the one who--but he had passed away by then.  But he was just, apparently, from every story I hear, he was just a brilliant man.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so that was your great grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, but, so, were there any math influences in your family?  Were any of your other relatives good at math?  Could they help you with math at home?
Speaker 2: My mom and dad were both, my dad was really good at math.  My brothers and sisters were really talented.  I remember that (laughter).  I have a younger brother who has a Ph.D. in physics, and I have another sister who is just--, I consider her just one of the most brilliant people I've ever met.  She's just tremendous.  So, yeah, but outside of that, I don't remember any other relative--and so my aunts who had gotten these advanced degrees, I never talked to them much about it.  I heard, it was more that I heard stories about them.  So I never really spent a lot of time talking to them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were in, before you graduated from high school, did you have an aspiration or goal (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I wanted to go into physics.  I wanted to do physics.  I wanted to be a researcher.  I wanted to do some of the things that the people I read about did, you know, come--get a deeper and more profound understanding of nature.  And, you know, it was a general kind of aspiration, not necessarily detailed and specific.  But this is what I wanted to do, yep.  So--
Speaker 1: Who were you reading about?  Who were some of your heroes or--
Speaker 2: Obviously, Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Galileo, some of the more modern people probably were Richard Feynman, I guess or some of the others that were more modern, but, yeah, a list.
Story_ID: 26045
Speaker 1: Now, did you know about any black scientists or physicists when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: At that time, I didn't.  At that time, I did not.  It wasn't until I went to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that I met black scientists.  So when I went to MIT, after I graduated from Messick [High School, Memphis, Tennessee] in 1977, all right, so one of the things before that, one of my friends when I went to Westwood [school, Memphis, Tennessee], he came from a family that was a bit more affluent.  And he, I think he was an only child, and his parents were pushing him to go to MIT.  And he was the one that started talking to me about, you know, yeah, man, this is the place to go if you wanna go into science.  And he and I were in the Science Club together.  We did science fair projects together.  We tried to build a rocket once.  And our aspirations were too ambitious.  We wanted to send this thing up into high orbit, which never worked.  But--
Speaker 1: But did it go up?
Speaker 2: It went up a little bit (laughter), not into orbit.  Anyway, we wanted--he was the one who really started talking to me about MIT.  And I remember reading about it in high school.  And so by the time I got to be a junior and then a senior in high school, I had moved to a different high school.  I no longer had contact with him, but this was the place to go if you wanted to go into science, if you wanted to do science.  For whatever reason, the Ivy Leagues, the Ivy League universities, I never really thought about it.  I guess they just seemed off limits, for whatever reason.  And I'm not sure why.  And MIT, I guess, to some extent was, would have been the same, except my friend, my--the friend that I had in high school was talking about it.  And his parents were pushing him in that direction, and I said, okay, I started thinking about it.
Story_ID: 26046
Speaker 1: So how did you, so you applied to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], I guess, in high school [Messick High School, Memphis, Tennessee], right?
Speaker 2: I did, I did.
Speaker 1: Did you have any counseling assistance or--
Speaker 2: I--
Speaker 1: --you did all this on your own or what?
Speaker 2: I had counselors, guidance counselors and, but they didn't say, "Keith, this is where you should go."  I told them this is where I wanted to go, I wanted to apply. And they started telling me what a great school it was, and once I got in, everybody was just really happy about it.  My teachers, guidance counselors, parents, relatives, right.
Speaker 1: So you say that you were not the top student at Messick--
Speaker 2: I was not.
Speaker 1: --and was not the valedictorian?
Speaker 2: I was not.  I wasn't the salutatorian.  I graduated down the list some, right.  I was not the best student.
Speaker 1: Okay, how were your grades?  Were they--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, I was an A student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I just didn't have the top position in my graduating class, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'd think a top science student would be the top student (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --but you don't, you know, I don't know.
Speaker 2: There were some really good students, some really bright students.  I think I was perhaps, I don't know.  Maybe I was a bit more motivated than they were, but I had some friends who were just really smart, really talented, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did they have like a tracking system in school when you were in school, where you take like, you're a college prep track and you're a business track and a general--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --track?
Speaker 2: No, I--there was no track, just, just the general, all the students had the same curriculum, the same access to the same curriculum.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were telling me earlier that you started reading about calculus in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right, in high school--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) high school, okay.
Speaker 2: --in eleventh and twelfth grade, right.  So, calculus--
Speaker 1: They didn't teach it in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Not at the high school I went to.  So I'd go to the library and, again, it was over my head.  But I do remember going to the library and getting books and calculus and starting to look at some of the things, some of the concepts, limits and, and how limits led to, you know, you could use limits to form derivatives and do differential calculus.  So, I, it must have helped some, but I do remember when I went to MIT that, yes, I remember I had to work really hard.
Speaker 1: Did you have physics at Messick?
Speaker 2: I did, I had a really good physics teacher.  Stewart was his name.  He was a really good physics teacher.  But I just, yes, so I had physics, I had chemistry.  I had math through trigonometry and I did really well in the courses.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so did you score on what--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --ACT or SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test; aptitude tests for college applications] or--
Speaker 2: So it was the SAT and the PSAT [Preliminary SAT], I did well on, I did well on those tests, right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 26047
Speaker 1: Now, in high school [Messick High School, Memphis, Tennessee] now--okay, so when you graduated, did you have time to be involved in clubs and activities and stuff like that?
Speaker 2: Right, so, yes, I did.  I was in, in the church, I played basketball and ran track, did other things in church.  And then in school, I was editor of the school paper my senior year, and I also was in the Science Club.  Let's see, what other club?  There was a Key Club, a service club.  I was a part of that, and, yes, and also there were summer programs that I applied to.  So even, so the summer between my fifth--no, let's see.  The summer between my tenth and eleventh grade I got into a special summer program down in Louisiana.  They chose me to come and be a part of group of other kids who got some--it was sort of like a college prep summer for us students from, throughout the South--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Was that the Timbuktu Academy down in southern--
Speaker 2: No, it was not.
Speaker 1: It wasn't them.
Speaker 2: I don't even think Timbuktu Academy--I'm aware of that now, but I don't even think it existed at the time.  It was something, it was at Louisiana Tech [University, Ruston, Louisiana].  It was a summer program.  So I got, so then I got introduced to calculus.  I got introduced to experimental physics in a way that I had not been exposed to before.  And it was a good summer.  It was an intense summer, but it was a good summer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, yeah.  And also, yeah, and so then the summer between my senior year and freshman years, I went off to--MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] had a special summer program where they brought in African American students to--MIT had just then, maybe just a few years before that really started to admit African Americans in large enough numbers so that we could have a critical mass, a critical mass of African Americans in the class.  And so what they did was, a lot of the students were really well prepared for MIT, especially the students, in my opinion, who had gone--well, there were lots of them.  The ones that I knew about most were from the Northeast, from New York, Bronx High School of Science [New York] and some of the other young people who had come from maybe private schools.  They were really well prepared, but for a person like me, I was not prepared for the kind of intense study I think required at MIT.  So this summer program really helped me.  It was called "Interphase", "Project Interphase" was what they called it.  So, yes, so then that was when I met my first African American physicist, Jim Gates was there, Mel Brown.  There was a woman, her name, I forget, she taught--her name was Karen Scott, Karen Scott taught calculus.  Jim Gates taught physics.  Mel Brown taught some physics and, yeah, so this was a really good period.  I just, I was just enjoying learning and just really, really had an impact on me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so this is good.  So this is, this is during the summer.  So when you start off, you've got some idea what you've gotta catch up to.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: That's correct.  So by the time the semester started in the fall, yes, we had, we were sort of ready to go, right.
Story_ID: 26048
Speaker 1: So this is the fall of 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-seven [1977].
Speaker 1: 1977, okay.  And, now, was calculus the biggest hurdle in this--
Speaker 2: Calculus wasn't--the biggest hurdle my freshman year was chemistry.  I had to take organic chemistry.  Now, that was a hurdle.  You wanna know about suffering, man, take organic chemistry (laughter).
Speaker 1: Organic chemistry, now, why was that one tougher?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I don't know.  I don't know, I just--
Speaker 1: Just at the time, you weren't really--
Speaker 2: I didn't wanna do chemistry, but, so the good thing about MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] at the time was all freshman year classes were "pass-fail."  You didn't get a letter grade for any course you took freshman year.  So what people like myself did was, all the courses that we knew we needed to graduate, but we hated, we took freshman year.  So I took organic freshman year so I could pass it and then just be done with it.
Speaker 1: But it didn't affect your GPA [grade point average] or anything like that because--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.  I, they--I didn't get a grade.  You just either passed it or you failed it.  So I don't even know what grade I would have gotten.  I don't know.  My guess, I don't know.  I don't know what grade I would have--
Speaker 1: Did you get grades for the other courses that you, you know, your freshman year?
Speaker 2: After freshman year, right, you got grades and so, yeah.  I was not, again, I wasn't the best student at MIT.  There were some really, just, just tremendous, just off-the-scale smart students there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I don't consider myself one of them, no.  The same in graduate school.  When I got to graduate school, I was just--so at MIT, there were--obviously, everyone there was really driven, really smart.  Just some of them were just really well prepared.  I mean I was just amazed at some of the backgrounds some of my friends came from, both in the African American community of students and in the larger community.  But, yeah, I do remember I wasn't the worse student there.  I do remember that.  I was sort of, you know, I did well enough, but I wasn't the best student there, no.
Story_ID: 26049
Speaker 1: Now, were there particular teachers and mentors at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] that you remember or fellow students that--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --really helped you in particular?
Speaker 2: Oh definitely, so, yes.  So, obviously, Jim Gates and Mel Brown who were in physics, they had a tremendous impact.  To this day, I remain in contact with Jim Gates.  He's a professor down at the University of Maryland.  And then, so here's another story, another gentleman there.  It's a white male, Bill Donnelly.  So all students at MIT at the time were expected to complete an undergraduate thesis on a, as part of the requirements to graduate.  So, as a senior, I guess it was, I was going around asking different professors if I could work for them to do a thesis.  And I remember all of them, all of them had a reason why, and some were legitimate.  You know, I'm just, I just have too many students now, and I can't take on another student.  So, it was a real surprise when I went to this one professor.  He was a, I guess he was a research professor at the time, Bill Donnelly.  And I walked into his office, and I asked him if I could work for him and to do a dissertation.  And he says, "Sure, come on in."  And that took me by surprise.  There was no, well, tell me about yourself, tell me about your background.  I, I was not as well prepared as I should have been at the time to work for him, but he was just so smart, just so bright that I was able to pick up enough from him and through his mentoring, I was able to get a dissertation, right--
Speaker 1: This is for the, I mean not a dissertation--this would be like a--
Speaker 2: It was an undergraduate thesis, right--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, thesis, yeah, right.
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, William Donnelly.  And he's still there, and I, when I see him on occasion now, we still talk, and it was just a fun time.  It was a fun project for (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What was your project?  What was your--
Speaker 2: Neutrino nuclear scattering.  So I looked at the scattering of neutrino, these neutroleptons from nuclei, carbon and other nuclei, and to try to calculate cross sections.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, okay, so.  Now, anything else significant happen on the first four years [at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts]?  I mean are you--when you finished the first four years, did you consider yourself caught up?  You're up to speed with--
Speaker 2: So, another thing that happened, I remember, when I just got to MIT in this Project Interphase [summer program before Baker's freshman year at MIT], I do remember the mid-term exam in physics Jim Gates gave us.  Jim used to give these really hard exams, okay.  He was just, he was just, I don't know sadistic like that.  But they were "pass-fail" which helped, right?  So Jim, obviously, is just a great friend of mine now.  He's just a great, great guy, he and his family, I know.  But at the end of it all, I was only a few points above the pass-fail mark.  And I was thinking to myself, okay, maybe I don't have this talent for physics that I need.  And I don't know, maybe I need to start thinking about something else.  That was that brief moment when I, this occurred to me, maybe I need to do something else.  It didn't last long.  Anyway, Jim called each of us into his office, all the students, one-by-one, into his office for a few minutes of discussion.  And when he called me in, I was expecting to hear the statement about, you know, how I needed to do better.  So I was really surprised when he said, you know, Keith, I've been teaching this for a long time.  And you solved this problem in a way that I had never seen solved before.  In the end, I was off by a factor of two.  I forgot to multiple it by two to get the final answer.  But he said, this shows real creativity, and, you know, I'm impressed.  And I want you to continue in physics, if that's what you wanna do.  He found out I wanted to go into physics, and that has stuck with me all these years.  And I remind Jim of that all the time now.  He sort of dismisses it.
Story_ID: 26050
Speaker 1: But, so MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was a good time in my life.  I liked, I played ball, I played varsity basketball for a few years.  I pledged a fraternity.  I used to do the things that young people do, but I do remember working really hard.  That was the thing about MIT.  I remember I felt like that, I'd go home on vacations and I'd talk to my friends who went to other universities.  And it just seemed like they were just having a lot more fun than I was.  I don't know why.  It just seemed like they were enjoying life more than I did.  And then the ones that didn't go to college, some of them had started families by then.  So I remember that about MIT.  But I do remember it just being, I was just--it was just a wonderful experience.  I just enjoyed being, I enjoyed everything about it.  I enjoyed the hard work.  I enjoyed the intensity, the students and others.
Speaker 2: But at MIT, though, were you atypical of most of the students--I mean a lot of the students are focused, aren't they on--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I started out, I started out being sort of a typical student.  I was very studious and very hardworking, and I was able to get to a point that I felt like I was, yeah, sort of like a--I was not, I was never the best MIT student, nor was I ever the worst.  So, I just remember I enjoyed that experience.  I enjoyed being there, right.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, they have something at MIT called the 'Black Student Union', right?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Were you a part of that?
Speaker 1: That's right, well, there was no organization that you joined.  But they were this support structure, right, the Black Student Union, and, yes, yes, I was.  And I also went back to be a tutor in the Project Innerphase [summer program at MIT], when I was a student, the first year I got there.  I went back and became a tutor some years later.  I also, when I was there, I got into another summer program at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], at SLAC [Stanford Linear Accelerator Center; National Accelerator Laboratory].  They had a program where they brought in young kids for some summer program.  And that was, I think where I met Carl Spight [also a HistoryMaker].  I think that's where I first met him.  He came out and gave lectures there.  And I, right, and I enjoyed California.  I enjoyed working at SLAC--.
Story_ID: 26051
Speaker 1: So when it was time to go to graduate school, I remember asking Bill Donnelly [Baker's undergraduate thesis advisor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts] for a recommendation, would he write a letter of recommendation for me.  And he did, and so I got into Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], into their Ph.D. program, and it worked out really well, so.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, so were you aiming for Stanford?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: Now, did you consider continuing on at MIT for the whole--
Speaker 1: I did.  I actually applied to MIT, and did not get in.  That, I was not admitted.  MIT just had, I think they--for one thing, they just had outstanding students applying there.  And so I probably was not in that group that was outstanding.  I never knew why.  But Stanford was my first choice.  I, I remember that, and so when I got into Stanford, I was just, I was thrilled.  And I went and talked to Bill Donnelly, thanked him for his letter, and he looked at me--so the reason I brought his name up is he had come from Stanford.  He had, he was a post-doctoral fellow, I guess, at Stanford.  And so, his reaction was, "Well, of course, you got in."  And that was why I brought his name up because I think, you know, he knew all along.  So, he--
Speaker 2: That's a pretty good consolation prize--
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: You don't get in MIT, but you get in Stanford.  I mean, you know, that's--
Speaker 1: Stanford was good.  It was my first choice, and there were a number of reasons why.  Stanford was just, it just had--I think I was ready for a break from the Northeast, and there was a young woman that I had, yeah, well, I was dating at the time who had gotten into Stanford.  And I don't know, maybe that had some influence on it as well.
Story_ID: 26052
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] as a graduate student, and--so at Stanford, it was, I think that I wasn't quite as serious about it the first year or two as I should have been.  I had had four years at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Baker went for his undergraduate studies].  I enjoyed it, but I worked really hard.  I just worked a lot, and I, I had fun.  There was basketball and other activities, but it just, I don't know.  I just, I just felt like, when I got to Stanford, the feeling that I had that started at MIT, like everyone else had a life, and I didn't.  Okay, it was only exacerbated when I went there, and I was older now.  My brother and even my younger brothers and sisters were married and had a, had families in some cases.  And all my friends had families, and, you know, by the time I was a third or fourth year graduate student at Stanford, I think, even some of my friends, yeah, so, no, they just had families.  And, you know, here I was, I owned maybe two or three pairs of jeans and a couple of t-shirts and a pair, you know, tennis shoes, and that's all I owned to my life.  And I'm (laughter) in early to mid-twenties.  And so, I should have been a little more serious about school at the time.  I remember that in retrospect.  I should have been a lot more serious about my studies.
Story_ID: 26053
Speaker 1: The good thing about Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], though, was, so the first year at Stanford, all the students rotated among different research groups, rotated among a few so you could see what it would be like to work in that group.  And, so by the time I settled on a group to work with, it was with this older German guy.  And at the time, our relationship, I felt like we just bumped heads, but in retrospect, it was one of the best moves I could have made because he was no nonsense.  Here was a guy, he was German.  He had spent time in a concentration camp.  This is a guy who had spent a short period of his younger life in a concentration camp.  So he was tough as nails.  And it was something I think that I needed at the time because he believed in discipline, okay.  And, and he let me know that, and again, being a young African American full of myself with my MIT degree, and I'd just gotten into Stanford, I think my opinion of myself--I know my opinion of myself was higher than it should have been.  And he made sure that, you know, that I, that he brought me down to the right levels.  He was good.
Speaker 2: So who is this?
Speaker 1: This was Walter Meyerhof.
Speaker 2: Walter Meyerhof.
Speaker 1: He passed away some years ago [May, 2006], but Walter Meyerhof, yeah.  He was just a great mentor.  He was, so one story about Walter that I like to tell people was when I, when it was time for me to choose a dissertation advisor, I went to him to ask if I could work with him.  And he gave me a problem to solve.  We discussed it, we discussed a project, and in the course of that discussion, there was a problem that had to do with the trajectory of a charged particle going between parallel, so--going between electrostatic plates.  So if the plates were parallel like this, and a charged particle goes through them, you could calculate that trajectory pretty--it was a straightforward calculation.  But now, what if one of them was tilted, and in this case, the charged particle, it's trajectory would be altered because one of these electrostatic plates was tilted.  So he told me to solve this problem.  He said, I want you to calculate, I want you to derive an expression that describes this trajectory of this charged particle through these plates.  So I worked really hard on it for a couple of days 'cause I wanted to impress Walter so I could work with him.  And after a few days, and I had to meet with him again, it wasn't--I knew I hadn't solved it, but I thought it was in a form that, okay, at least he could tell that I had been working on it, and maybe we could discuss it and find out how to go forward.  So he looked at it.  He looked at the first equation and it was pages and pages of calculation.  And then he looked at the last equation, and then he just put a big red "X" through all these pages, [making scratching noise].  "Keith, you know, this is crap, you know, and your understanding of physics is like at the level of an undergrad, and if you wanna work with me, you're gonna have to do a lot better."  So I, you know, I'm standing there staring at him while he was telling me that.  And that was our meeting.  And he said--I don't remember the exact words, but it was something along the lines of, do better.  So I went and I actually solved the problem.  I went and I used conformal mapping.  In conformal mapping, what you could do is, you could rotate this, this top plate that was tilted back so that it's parallel to the bottom plate.  Then it was a rather straightforward calculation to calculate the trajectory of this particle.  And then you could use conformal mapping, this inverse mapping, to rotate the plate back up and get an expression for this trajectory.  So I solved it, and I took it back to him, and I showed it to him.  And he looked at it, and all he said to me was, "Oh, my compliments to you," and then he gave me another problem to solve, (laughter), and I liked him ever since.  It wasn't until years later I found out that Walter had tried to solve the problem and couldn't.  I don't know how I found that out, but he also, he couldn't solve the problem, and I solved it.  And I don't think he ever told me.  I think I must have learned it from somebody else.
Story_ID: 26054
Speaker 1: Okay, we were telling Walter Meyerhof [Baker's doctoral thesis advisor at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California] stories.
Speaker 2: Right, so one of the things that I really appreciated about what Walter taught me was discipline.  Yeah, he was, he was just--that was just his personality, his background, everything else.  And it was really good because I was, again, young and full of myself, and had a too-high opinion of myself and my abilities.  So what Walter taught me, one of the things, for example, when we were working on this experiment for my dissertation, and I was trying to be clever.  I was trying to be clever so that I could maybe get to the result quicker.  And I remember him blasting me about this.  He said, you know, when you're working on an experiment, you're getting something new.  You're getting new data.  Otherwise, why do the experiment?  You're trying to understand something new, some phenomena that hasn't been understood at this level before.  So when you see something you don't understand, you'll have to know.  Is this an instrumental anomaly?  Is this something about the way you're conducting the experiment that's wrong or is this something new, some new physics?  And the only way you're gonna know that is if you've done the careful preparation and followed each step and understand your equipment, understand your procedure, understand, you know, the software associated with your experiment.  You've got to understand that in detail.  And I always remembered that as I got older.  There is a, there is room for cleverness in experimental--in all of physics.  But it has its place was the thing that stuck with me.  Don't try to be so clever that you skip steps and so when you do see something new, is this some new physics or is this just an instrumental anomaly or something that--because you haven't set the experiment up right.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26055
Speaker 1: Now, when you're in grad school [at Stanford University], this is where you receive the Dorothy Danforth Compton--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Fellowship, right--
Speaker 2: Correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: --for school.  And this is the fellowship that enabled you to go to Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], is that true or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: --where did you go before--
Speaker 2: --right, so let's see.  How did this work out?  Right, my first year, I got a Dorothy Danforth Compton Fellowship.  I, it seems like there was something else in there.  That didn't pay for everything, but there was another fellowship.  There was something else that I had gotten.  But, yes, so my first year there, I had fellowships.  And then after, Walter [Meyerhof, Baker's doctoral thesis advisor at Stanford University] picked me up full time to work with him.  So I was paid as a research assistant to work with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is like, in most sciences like the liberal arts, you don't take the time to celebrate a master's degree.  You just go right through--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --with the Ph.D.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So the master's degree was sort of something that I sort of got along the way just to say okay, I've achieved something in my life.  But it wasn't a big deal in the sense of the Ph.D. is the big deal, right.
Speaker 1: So getting a Ph.D. in physics or anything of these, any of the hard sciences is a dedication to a certain amount of time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --as a young adult where you're gonna spend studying in the laboratory--
Speaker 2: Correct. That's correct, that's correct, that's right.
Speaker 1: --without a lot of material reward for it.
Speaker 2: That's correct, that is correct.
Speaker 1: But you, to tell the truth, you don't really have time for a lot of material reward 'cause you're studying, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I mean, it is, you--you know, at that age, I was young and, yes, I enjoyed life, but right, there wasn't the sort of monetary rewards.  It's interesting.  When I met the woman who became my wife, she came to visit me in California.  She lived in Houston [Texas] at the time.  And I remember her telling me that she was surprised.  She didn't know human beings could live the way that I lived.  You know, she (laughter) said, I didn't think this was possible (laughter).  So, it's funny.  We laugh about that now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26056
Speaker 1: So--well, how did you live?  Describe what you, what your place was like?
Speaker 2: So, let's see.  I lived with two other grad students, and so, you know, two other guys who were grad students.  I don't know, let's see.  So what do you say?  If you can imagine two of your friends who were just, I don't know,--well, one of my grad students, he actually had a, he had his head on his shoulders right.  He actually wanted to keep the place clean and, you know, you wash the dishes.  And you put the dishes away when you finish.  You actually sweep the floor or vacuum the carpet every so often.  And he was like that, but my other roommates and I sort of, okay, you gotta study and everything else is just, takes a back seat, right.  And you gotta do your research.  And then when you're not in the laboratory, let's say you're able to sneak out one Saturday night to go somewhere.  That's what you wanna do.  You don't wanna go home and clean up, right?  (Laughter) You wanna go out and enjoy yourself.  So, I met some really good people.  My roommates were just, I--they remain life-long friends, and some of my classmates.  The class that I was in at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California] had just some really, just tremendously bright and talented people.  Some of them, one person I know of is a professor at Stanford.  One is a professor at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles].  One is a professor at Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Now, you can name them if you wanna.  It's okay.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, these are people who, yeah, they were friends of mine, and there were lots of others as well.  They were just, they were just really, just smart, really bright.  So I was fortunate to be able to know them and work alongside them.
Story_ID: 26057
Speaker 1: Now, what was your [doctoral] dissertation topic?
Speaker 2: My dissertation was on a nuclear resonance effect in atomic electron capture.  So, the idea behind this experiment was, you have atomic physics and the energy scales associated with atomic physics are like electron volts, maybe a few electron volts.  The energy scales associated with nuclear physics are millions of electron votes or maybe even more than that.  So they were thought to be distinct and separate kind of energy scales or if you want, (unclear) scales and time scales associated with these kinds of processes.  So my dissertation was to look at the interplay between them.  So what we did was, if you take a proton and, of certain energy, and you scatter it from a nucleus, in some cases, you can excite a nuclear resonance.  What does that mean?  It means now that this nucleus will start to wobble or it'll start to have some kind of motion that it would not have before.  And this is what we call a nuclear resonance.  Now, this--so, so the proton that scatters from the nucleus normally doesn't care about the atomic electrons.  The energies are so high that the fact that this nucleus has atomic electrons around it won't affect the process.  My dissertation was to look at the case where it did affect it.  So when I scattered this proton from this nucleus, if it, on the way into the scattering, it could pick up an electron and so it becomes neutral hydrogen, but it still scatters off the nucleus.  Or the proton could scatter off the nucleus, and then on the way out of that nuclear collision, pick up an electron and become neutral hydrogen.  And then there was another process as well where it could scatter the electron, the nu--the proton scatters from the nucleus.  The electron scatters from the nucleus, and then they could--it could pick up--the proton could pick up the electron.  So, those are all amplitudes for this scattering process.  And in quantum mechanics, you always add the amplitudes and then you square that, those amplitudes.  So you'd get an effect, you'd get an interference effect, and that was my dissertation, to look for this interference effect.  If you looked at the cross section for this to happen, this atomic electron capture in the presence of a nuclear resonance, and you looked at the probability for that to happen as a function of energy, you'd see this interference effect.  And it was a quantum mechanical effect that you wouldn't expect to see classically, and I was able to show that in my dissertation.  So, yeah.
Story_ID: 26058
Speaker 1: Okay, now, how did that experiment, like advance the field of physics?
Speaker 2: Right, so, you know, so you're asking a question, you know, is this something that had a profound effect upon our understanding of nature?  I would say it wasn't.  It--what was the best thing to come out of that experiment?  I verified this quantum mechanical effect, this interference effect that you add amplitudes and then you square that sum.  The other thing I was able to do was I think it was important in the technique that I did, the fact that--so I described to you earlier how we were going to do the experiment using electrostatic plates, but in the end we did not use electrostatic plates because you'd have to have very high potentials, and then I would sometimes be working in the lab by myself, and, you know, if you have a very high voltage, and if I'm sleepy and I'm tired, I grab the wrong lead, you know, that's a wrap.  So we decided to use magnetic deflection instead.  It was easier.  It was safer, and so that technique was good because it taught me a lot that I was able to use later on in my career.  And then just the fact that the, the training that I got, just--that was, you have to understand.  I had an understanding, for once in my life, I had a complete understanding of everything associated with that experiment.  The accelerator that was used to accelerate the protons, how they were accelerated.  I'd go in and fix it.  If something didn't work, I'd go in and fix it.  If the, if something needed upgrading, I'd go in myself and do the work and make, go into the machine shop and make the little widgets and the little pieces needed to make this thing go forward.  I knew the software.  I knew, I--you know, how to write all this code in Fortran [computer programming language] to do it.  I knew all the hardware.  If something went wrong, I knew where it went wrong, and I knew how to fix it.  And then the analysis of the data and interpreting it and how it related to other studies on that particular topic from other experiments and other laboratories around the world.  I knew all of it.  And so, once in my life, I just felt like, you know, I know all there is to know about this particular piece of physics, and that was just a wonderful feeling.  I have to say, there's probably, let me--I didn't have that kind of comprehensive understanding of an experiment since, to understand what everything was, every bolt, every cable, every line of code, every, yeah, everything.
Speaker 1: It seems to me that you're just, you know, you not only earned the Ph.D., you actually felt like a Ph.D.--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely, absolutely--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --when you were done with this process.
Speaker 2: --definitely.  Yeah, I felt like, yes, and here was an original piece of work that I had done and my name attached to it, and, yes, certainly (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's different from people saying they were given a Ph.D. and that sort of thing.  But this is you actually, you know--
Speaker 2: That's right, well, yeah, I earned the Ph.D.  So, I, yeah, that's right.  I earned it.  They had to confer it on me, but--and my advisor at the time, I mean he was just really pleased with it.  The same guy who had criticized me for not being able to do this one problem when I first went to try to work with him, he wrote me just outstanding dissertations--outstanding letters of recommendation, outstanding.  Even when I went, years later people were talking about, not the details, but the fact that he had really glowing remarks about me as a student.  So I really appreciated it.
Story_ID: 26059
Speaker 1: So, now, you went on to do a post-doc at Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico]?
Speaker 2: Los Alamos, right, exactly.
Speaker 1: In New Mexico, right.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So what happened there was, I went to a talk in Oklahoma at an American Physical Society [APS] meeting down in Oklahoma.  And one of the guys that got up, that gave a talk, Peter Campbell, who is now a professor at the University of Washington [Seattle, Washington], I believe, he gave this really intriguing talk about muon-catalyzed fusion.  And what I found intriguing was that it was a laboratory where lots of different physics had to work together for this catalysis of this fusion reaction to take place.  All the molecular physics had to work out right.  All the atomic physics, all the nuclear physics, and even some particle physics, you know, played a role in this.  So, so when I heard this talk, he was saying, you know, you gotta understand molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, particle physics.  You gotta understand all of that.  That just intrigued me and excited me.  And I said, yeah, I wanna do that.  So after he gave the talk, I was just finishing up my Ph.D. at the time, and I talked to him about getting a post-doc.  And, and he put me in touch with some people in Los Alamos, and they invited me to come and give a talk on my dissertation research, and they made an offer.  So I went to Los Alamos, and took a post-doc there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were there from 1986--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --well, your Ph.D. was in '87 [1987].
Speaker 2: Right, so I left to go there a few months before I finished writing.  I had already gotten all my data, but it was just the--I was in the writing stage.  So Walter [Meyerhof, Baker's doctoral advisor at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California] let me go there and finish writing my dissertation.  Part of it was because I was married at the time and he knew I needed money.  So, you know, Los Alamos was offering me a lot more money than I was making at the time as a graduate student and being married, yeah, so.
Story_ID: 26060
Speaker 1: Now, where did you meet your wife, that you--
Speaker 2: So I met her in Houston, Texas.  I had a sister who lived in Houston and my oldest sister felt that it was completely incomprehensible, how you could be in your mid-twenties and not be married.  And so she introduced me to Beretta, and we talked on the phone a lot, and we wrote lots of letters, and I'd see her once or twice a year when I'd go to visit my sister.  And we became close that way.  That's how we became close, many, many miles separated from each other.  And so when we got to the point that, when we got to the point that I had finished my dissertation, and I'd gotten all the data, and I had pretty much done all the analysis, and I was writing, we talked about getting married.  And a lot of people were advising us both against it.  They said, you know, you're just dirt poor now, and why not get a job, work for a year, save up some money and then your marriage will be a lot easier.  But, you know, we were in love, so, you know, we did it.  Let's just do it.  So we got married just before I finished at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California].  And then we moved to Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico], and I finished writing and submitted the dissertation.  And it all worked out.
Story_ID: 26061
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you work on at Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico]?
Speaker 2: So muon-catalyzed fusion was the process that I worked on.  So if you have a deuterium nucleus and iridium nucleus, and you bring them together so that they fuse, they can form an object that's a union of these two different nuclei.  Now, when you do that, excuse me, in the process of fusing those two nuclei, you can make more energy than it took to put them together.  So what that means now is that here's a way to, this is an energy-generation process.  You have, more energy comes out than it takes to bring these two nuclei together.  Now, there are several ways to do that.  One is inertia confinement fusion.  This is what they do at Los Al--at Lawrence Livermore [National] Lab [Livermore, California].  You can put these two things in (unclear) pellets that are very close to each other.  And then you can hit it from all different sides with lasers.  And these lasers makes these things fuse and then out comes this explosion with more energy, in principle, coming out than you put into it.  Another way would be in magnetic confinement fusion where this is what they're trying to do with these tokomak devices.  You can maybe bring them close enough to fuse to each other using very strong magnetic fields.  The reason it's a challenge is because they both have positive charge so they want to repel each other, but if you can somehow bring them close together so you can overcome this Coulomb repulsion, then they can fuse, and you get this, lots of energy out.  So what we had was a different way to do that.  Instead of using magnets, high magnetic fields or lasers, you can use a muon, a subatomic particle is--
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Muon, M-U-O-N.
Speaker 1: M-U-O-N.
Speaker 2: And the muon is like an electron only much heavier.  So what happens then is quantum mechanics, this muon forms an orbit around both of them, like a molecular orbit around both of them.  Now, because the muon is so heavy, it pulls them closer to each other.  So if they were an electron, they'd be this far apart because the electron is so light.  But because the muon is so heavy, it pulls them in closer to each other.  And so now, the chance that they fuse goes up, and so this is what I worked on as a post-doc.  We worked on this process and specifically, we were the first to measure what's called the sticking probability.  So this is what you want to happen.  You want this muon to bring the deuterium and the iridium nucleus very close together so that they fuse, and then this fusion releases energy.  It releases a neutron and some alpha particles.  And then, and then you want that muon to go on and catalyze other fusions.  So you want one muon to catalyze lots and lots of these different fusions so that you can make lots and lots of energy.  But what happens, if the muon gets stuck in an atomic orbital around one of these nuclei, then the game is over.  It's no longer free to go and catalyze fusions, other fusions.  So we measured that sticking probability.  What's the probability that after this fusion process the muon is liberated to go on to catalyze other fusions versus when it, after the fusion process, the muon gets stuck in an atomic orbital around one of these nuclei.  So we measured that probability.  The probability was a half percent.  Now, here's the interesting thing.  Here's the, here's what interesting.  We showed scientifically this would work as an energy production mechanism.  You would get more energy out than you put in if you looked at the rest mass of the muon versus the masses of these nuclei versus how much energy it takes to create a muon and form this orbital.  Scientifically, you get more energy out than you put in.  The problem was that accelerators were so inefficient that you couldn't, it would--we didn't have enough efficiency in accelerators to create efficiently these muons to make this as a viable energy production mechanism.  So even though it worked scientifically, technologically, accelerators weren't efficient enough to make this a viable, as an energy production mechanism, to make a reactor this way.  So--
Speaker 1: Will the accelerators in the future be able to do it?
Speaker 2: Possibly, possibly.  There were some really clever ideas where people wanted to say, okay, let's make a fusion-fission blanket.  Maybe this, by itself, won't work, but maybe if we surrounded it with some fission blanket, you could have a hybrid of a fusion-fission reactor.  There were some other ideas, I think that even maybe at one of the labs in the country--in this country, that's thinking about making a muon collider.  They're looking at this.  I think the Japanese, the Russians and some other scientists in other countries looked at this as well.  So perhaps, maybe one day, we'll have an accelerator that's so efficient that it may be viable.  I just don't know, but I sort of left the field at the time.  I left it when I finished my post-doc there.  But the reason I joined that experiment wasn't because I was interested in energy production.  What I liked about it was that all of these different processes had to work just right in order for us to achieve this fusion, this muon-catalyzed fusion.  The molecular physics, had to work just right.  The atomic physics had to work just right.  The nuclear physics had to work just right, and I just enjoyed this as the laboratory, this, this laboratory to make this, to study this physics.  That, to me, was the major draw and the attraction.
Story_ID: 26062
Speaker 1: Okay, now, after your post-doc, you joined the faculty at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], right?
Speaker 2: Right.  So I spent a few months in North Carolina, but not--I didn't get, I only spent a few months there, and then I--
Speaker 1: Did you teach in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't.  It was just a, it was just a short-term position.
Speaker 1: At the University of North Carolina?
Speaker 2: It was at, yes, it was North Carolina State [University, Raleigh], Duke University [Durham] and University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.  They had this small laboratory there that I spent just a few months there.  But, right, so, when I was a post-doc at Los Alamos [National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Hampshire], the discussions were about this brand new facility, this new thing called CEBAF, Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility, and it was the newest machine that they were gonna build in this country to do nuclear physics.  And this is what I wanted to be a part of.  So, I remember thinking, man, it sure would be nice if I could get on there.  So what happened was, the person who was a professor of mine at Stanford [University, Palo Alto, California], Dirk Walecka, he taught me quantum mechanics at Stanford.  In fact, he became the scientific director at CEBAF, which is now called [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab [Virginia].  So when I finished--
Speaker 1: J-Lab.
Speaker 2: J-Lab, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jefferson--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: So when I finished my post-doc at Los Alamos, I contacted him to see what possibilities existed and--
Speaker 1: This is Dirk--
Speaker 2: Dirk Walecka, W-A-L-E-C-K-A.  Yeah, they had hired, they had lured him away from Stanford.  They gave him a very distinguished professorship.  The state of Virginia gave him an endowed professorship to lure him away from Stanford.  And so he, he made--whatever people at that level do, he did and they made me an offer, and I took a joint appointment with Hampton University and Jefferson Lab in Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26063
Speaker 1: So at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] was Dr. Demetrius Venable [also a HistoryMaker], right?
Speaker 2: That's right.  You knew, yeah, you knew Demetrius?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Demetrius is just a wonderful guy.  I just, I just really look up to him and admire and respect him.  And so, yep, he--I think the reason I did was I saw some elements of the way he did physics that I felt was the way that either I aspired to do physics, or perhaps I had done at the time.  He was just bright, he was focused.  He was conscientious and without a lot of--he seemed, it seemed to me at the time that he didn't have to have a lot of fanfare.  He didn't have to thrive on a lot of attention.  He just did his work, and he was really talented, and that's what I tried to do.  So, yeah, he was department chair, and Dirk Walecka [Baker's former professor at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California] was the scientific director of J-Lab [Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, Virginia].  And the other person--there were a couple other people involved in that at Hampton.  One was a former friend, colleague and a friend of mine from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He was a graduate student when I started at MIT, and so he and I were buddies.  And then there was another guy there--
Speaker 1: Who was he?
Speaker 2: Calvin Lowe [also a HistoryMaker], L-O-W-E, yeah.  Calvin was--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just interviewed him last week.
Speaker 2: Is that right?  He's down at Hampton now, right--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --as dean, yeah, yeah, Calvin.  So he was one of the tutors in the Project Interphase program [summer program at MIT that Baker had attended before his freshman year] when I got there as a freshman.  He was a grad student.  And then Warren Buck [also a HistoryMaker] was also there.  He had gotten, he was trying to build up a nuclear program there, and Demetrius Venable and Robert Bonner was the dean.  So, yeah, they pulled whatever strings needed to be pulled, and I got a joint appointment at Hampton University and Jefferson Lab.
Speaker 1: So the Jefferson Accelerator is there, right, at Hampton?
Speaker 2: That's right, so CEBAF [Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility], right.  It was only a twenty-minute commute, drive between the two, less than twenty minutes between Hampton [University] and Jefferson Labs.  So it was a really good joint appointment.  I was able to teach and get students at Hampton, and I was able to be at this facility that was at the cutting edge of intermediate energy, nuclear physics, and--at Jefferson Lab which is right down the road.  It was just a wonderful set up.
Speaker 1: CEBAF, yeah.  There's a NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] facility there, and--
Speaker 2: That's right, NASA was there, and NASA Langley [Research Center], right.
Speaker 1: A lot of science going on around there--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in those days.  So, well, tell us what happened.  Was, Paul Gueye [also a HistoryMaker] wasn't there yet, was he?  Paul?
Speaker 2: That's right.  No, he wasn't there when I hired--I actually hired Paul's young post-doc some years, a few years later, I think three years after I got there.  He was a young, young guy that had just gotten his degree in France, and at the time--and I still am interested now to get more blacks into science, those that want to go into science.  I don't think everyone, I don't think--well, I think you have to want to do science, but for those blacks that want to do science, I was interested to try to provide an environment where they could come and be creative and thrive.  And so he was one of the first people I hired, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, so how did things go at Hampton?  This seems like a great environment.
Speaker 2: It was, oh, I just, I loved it there.  I loved it.  Hampton and Jefferson Lab, being in Virginia, it was just a wonderful time in my life.  I had a young family.  My children were born, and young there, and my wife enjoyed living there.  Hampton Roads [the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Virginia-North Carolina metropolitan area which surrounds it in southeastern Virginia] was, you know, as you said, there was Jefferson Lab, there was NASA Langley, there were the colleges there, Hampton [University], Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia], the College of William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia], Old Dominion University [Norfolk], Christopher Newport University [Newport News, Virginia], Christopher Newport College at the time.  So, it was just a great time in our life, and being at this new facility, doing cutting-edge nuclear physics, wonderful, just a wonderful time.  I spent seventeen years there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26064
Speaker 1: All right, so, what would you, you know,--well, one thing we always ask.  We ask about the breakdown between, of your time between doing research and doing teaching [at Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know, was it the proper balance for you at the time?
Speaker 2: I think, I think the people, my deans and the department chair cut me a lot of slack.  I went there to do research mainly.  That was my main interest and that took up the most, the bigger part of my time.  The teaching was something I enjoyed, but I didn't go there to be a teacher.  I went there to do research.  I really enjoyed it.  I enjoyed working with just some tremendous students there, just bright, focused, hardworking.  The thing that impressed me a lot about the students there was that I was impressed with just how, just the way that they handled the pressure that was on them.  This was a new program, the graduate program, and especially, the Ph.D. program that was just getting started was new, and this was at a university that was just one of the most outstanding HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] of all the HBCUs that exist, but it didn't have the long tradition in doing the kinds of physics, particle physics.  It had, it was one of the best optics and lasers programs in the state in my opinion.  It was just a tremendous department and tremendous research and a long history in laser and optical physics, materials physics, but not so much in nuclear and particle physics.  This was starting up.  So as you might imagine, these students and post-docs that we hired to work there, they were under tremendous scrutiny.  And there was just the pressure from people, you know, are they able to do science at this level?  And these were just students, I mean the way they did their research, got their Ph.D.s, made these fundamental contributions to nuclear physics and handled that kind of pressure and scrutiny, really impressed me.  They, they didn't complain.  They went in and did their work and bam, you know, published the results and said, you know, you guys think what you wanna think.  That's fine with us.  We're gonna do our research and move on.  And that's what they did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26065
Speaker 1: Okay, so CEBAF [Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility] Laboratory, J-Lab [Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, Virginia]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and seventeen years?
Speaker 2: That's correct.  I was there seventeen years, right.
Speaker 1: And was it, so you're in a position to raise money for your research.  Am I right by saying that or--
Speaker 2: Yes, I wouldn't say "raise" money, to get research grants, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yes, to get research (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was one of the most heavily funded researchers in, at probably any number of universities, that's right.  Yep, I was very, very happy about that; did some really great work there, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what would you consider the highlights of those seventeen years?
Speaker 2: So, one was the experiments that I was a part of, helping to build up, first of all, the infrastructure at Jefferson Lab.  It was a greenfield facility when I got there.  Nothing existed.  They hadn't even started digging the tunnels to put the accelerator there.  So I put together a team that built some of the detectors, the wire chambers for, for the experiments there in Hall C.  That was a big deal, and then I was, proposed a new experiment there--I proposed many.  But the first one was to measure this, the properties of this particle called a kaon, a K meson.  This is the lightest, it has a strange quark and a constituent, strange quark in the constituent-quark model of hadrons.  It has an up quark and anti-strange quark.  So, so this, we had to build detectors, set up the experiments, set up the spectrometers and understand the experiment in such a way that we can make these measurements.  And this was a lot of intense work over a long period of time, and I'm very happy to say that we did it.  It was just a wonderful result in the end.  We measured what's called the amp--elementary amplitudes in the production, electromagnetic production of this K meson in a way that, with the precision that you could not have done at other facilities.  Because of the nature of CEBAF we were able to do these experiments.  So I was very proud of that.  I did other kaon production experiments there and worked on other hardware projects there, building detectors.  So I just really enjoyed it, really enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I had some really great people to work with there.  Dirk Walecka was one, obviously, at Jefferson Lab.  There was the director, Hermann Grunder [experimental nuclear physicist] who was there at the time, who was--he had a style of leadership that I had not seen before.  So it was interesting and exciting to learn from him.  He used to bring me into his office some time and talk to me about his style of leadership.  There was John Domingo who was the head of the physics division at the time who was a really colorful guy, interesting guy, who I kid with him now, joke with him about the guy that gave me my first job.
Story_ID: 26066
Speaker 1: And then at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] Demetrius Venable [also a HistoryMaker], Warren Buck [also a HistoryMaker], Calvin Lowe [also a HistoryMaker], Robert Bonner, Don [Donald] Whitney, Kwang Han, it was just a--lots of really just great people, and, of course, the president of the University at the time who really gave me the support and made the kind of environment where I could be creative and thrive, William Harvey, the president there.  So I really--
Speaker 2: And still president and--
Speaker 1: He's still the president.
Speaker 2: --been the president for a long time.
Speaker 1: He has and just tremendously successful at being president.  And so, absolutely.  His, his leadership style also.  I didn't, I didn't get a chance to really go and spend long periods of time with him, but the periods of time that I did spend talking with him were just wonderful, fantastic, seeing his leadership style, yeah.
Story_ID: 26067
Speaker 1: Tell us about the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker [component for the ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland].
Speaker 2: Right, after I finished building the detectors at Jefferson Lab [Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, Virginia], and done the first round of experiments there, now--so Jefferson Lab was this new facility when I was a post-doc [at Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico] that was just gonna, just being discussed, right?  And I was able to get in on the ground floor of that major new project.  So now, after a few years at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], after I'd achieved some success there and built some wire chambers, I wanted to now expand my research activities to include this new energy frontier machine.  This was gonna be the biggest machine ever built--the SSC [Superconducting Super Collider; particle accelerator complex] down in, that was to be built in Texas had been cancelled.  So I thought, okay, now, the only way to go to the energy frontier was to work at the LHC, the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva [Switzerland].  So I had experience building wire chambers, and I wanted to know if I could now apply that expertise and experience to help build wire chambers for this new experiment, ATLAS, at the Large--I didn't know which one at the time.  I wanted to work on one of the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider [of seven particle detector experiments].  So one, one of the things that happened at Hampton is we had a review committee, a review of our program.  And one of the people who was on the review committee was Jerry, Jerome Friedman.  He was a Noble Laureate, Nobel Prize [in physics] winner [in 1990] from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He was one of the professors that I had interacted with as an undergrad [undergraduate] student at MIT.  So when he came, we talked again, and we--I certainly remembered him and at least, he seemed to remember me.  So we talked for a while and I told him about my interest in maybe becoming a part of this LHC activity.  So he was the one who gave me the advice on what to do.  He was the one who contacted, who at the time was the head of the U.S. contribution to the ATLAS project.  And he called this guy up and said, I got this young guy down at Hampton [University] that wants to apply his expertise to help to build up this, this LHC detectors in ATLAS.  And his name was Bill Willis.  He was a professor at Columbia [University, New York City], William J. Willis.  And Bill came down to Hampton and visited me.  He came down, he looked at what I had done.  He looked at the wire chambers and he was from Arkansas, just like I was an Arkansas native, and he made it happen.  There was a lot of inertia to overcome.  There was a lot of--and because Hampton did not have a history in doing this kind of physics, there were a lot of questions, "Why does Hampton want to get involved in this?"  "Why don't they just stick with the Jefferson Lab program which is right in their neighborhood?"  And "why is Keith trying to get involved in this major project that's gonna take lots of resources and is gonna take him away from Jefferson Lab, and he has to go over to Geneva to work."  And Bill Willis and another person at the funding agencies, Marv [Marvin] Goldberg, especially, they ran a lot of interference, and they did whatever was needed to make this happen.  And so Marv Goldberg at the NSF [National Science Foundation] was able to get funding directed to me.  Bill Willis was able to talk to the people in the community, in particle physics and say, look, make this happen.  And that just left me to go and build detectors, and so I was able to assemble a group of really talented people, post-doc students and research professors and we helped to build this transition radiation tracker.  So this is a wire chamber, but more than just a tracking chamber.  It also allowed you to distinguish between leptons and hadrons, and this was a distinguishing characteristic of this, this type of device.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we were able to build it, yep.
Speaker 1: All right, okay, so this is in, what year is this done?
Speaker 2: I started working on that in '94 [1994], '95 [1995], somewhere in there.  So, yeah, it's been sort of, yeah, eighteen years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26068
Speaker 1: So, now, what--do you care to comment on the--there's a popular culture idea that the Large Hadron Collider [LHC, particle accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), Switzerland] was gonna create a black hole or something?
Speaker 2: Right, right, there was--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) (unclear) the universe and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --some, some people felt that way, yeah.  And there was a--
Speaker 1: Was that a serious discussion?
Speaker 2: It was serious.  Absolutely, there was a lawsuit that was being brought against whoever to cancel this construction because, yeah.  And so there was theory--there is a theory in extra dimensions whereby if you pump enough energy into a small enough region of space, you could create a miniature black hole.  And the thought was that maybe this miniature black hole would be created, and then it would start to suck up matter, and so this miniature black hole would become a massive black hole and just destroy the earth.  And what was interesting about that was I was helping to build ATLAS [A Toroidal LHC Apparatus, particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider], I was an intimate part of it.  And the, one of the people who were bringing this lawsuit against--I don't even know who the lawsuit was against.  Maybe it was against CERN, to stop it.  They sent me a copy of the lawsuit and said, would you sign this (laughter)?  I thought that was amusing.  I didn't, of course.  I never responded.  But, yeah, so they had study groups put together, I'm sorry, a study group of scientists that looked into this and concluded, no, there was no, no risk or the risk was so small as to be nonexistent.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but it did have some scientific merit, at least to be investigated--
Speaker 2: That's correct.  Now, you have to pay attention to these things, right, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 26069
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, one of the--I don't wanna jump too far away, but 2002--there are a lot of grants and funding along the way, you know, and--
Speaker 2: Right, that's correct.
Speaker 1: --what's the largest grant you ever--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, so this Physics Frontier Center was the one that I had, was able to get in 2002, I guess it was, 2002, 2003.  So this was under the vision of, and leadership of the head of the physics division at the time, Joseph Dehmer, at the National Science Foundation [NSF].  He wanted to start a new type of center, one that had tremendous potential for revolutionary advances in our understanding of physics or science and potentially high risk, but with high pay off, and he wanted it to be something that was more physics focused as opposed to the larger more diverse kinds of ideas, having to do with just technology centers.  He wanted something more focused on physics and science.  And so he announced this and the person who I worked most closely with at the National Science Foundation, Marv [Marvin] Goldberg, alerted me to this new opportunity, if I wanted to apply.  And I applied, and it was a long process, a long and I would say, sort of circuitous route to this Physics Frontier Center, but once we won that PFC, I was just, it was just another thing that I considered one of the greatest successes in my career, winning this award.
Speaker 1: This is in 2002.
Speaker 2: 2002, right.  So it was five years, a million dollars a year, and I was able to work with other--not just at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and Jefferson Lab [Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, Virginia], but other universities, Norfolk State [University, Norfolk, Virginia], North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical] State University [Greensboro, North Carolina], and several others.  We, we came together and did nuclear physics.  I, my--and particle physics.  Nuclear physics at Jefferson Lab, particle physics at ATLAS [(A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland] at the Large Hadron Collider [LHC], and other, other activities.  Demetrius Venable [also a HistoryMaker] at Howard [University] was also part of it.  So, it was a great, great activity.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26070
Speaker 1: Now, you were part of a, you played a role in the discovery of evidence that made, of the Higgs boson--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --that was just, that just happened this summer, right?
Speaker 2: The announcement was just made in the summer of 2012, July 4, 2012, the announcement was made, right.
Speaker 1: Well, can you try to give, break down to us, like what is Higgs boson and what were you trying to find out?  What was found?
Speaker 2: Right, so we have four fundamental interactions.  There's the electro--there's the strong nuclear interaction.  There's the weak nuclear interaction.  There's the electromagnetic interaction, and then there's the gravitational interaction.  So let's leave gravity outside of this for now.  So we have a theory that describes the strong electromagnetic and weak interaction.  In fact, it unifies electromagnetic and weak interaction and the strong interaction.  This is what it was designed to do.  So it's been called the most successful theory ever developed.  It describes these processes over many, many orders of magnitude in coupling strength and energy.  It also describes it with a precision that is just so impressive that, again, you know, it's just, just a marvelous theory, or description I would say, a framework to describe our universe.  But the issue with that is, the reason it works so well is because in it all the particles are massless.  They have no mass.  But we know that some particles do have mass.  We know that, for example--and some don't have mass, like photons that are creating this light now are massless.  And that's what mediates the electromagnetic interaction.  But the W boson and the Z boson, the W bosons and the Z boson that mediate the weak interaction are very massive.  So, so, and also, electrons have mass and quarks have mass.  So how is it that these things are all unified, but you have these different mass scales when the theory that we use to describe it, in its--in the way that it was so successful is because these particles all are massless.  So there were several possibilities.  One possibility is if there's some extra dimensions and extra space dimensions that could give rise to this in some complicated way.  There may have been other ideas out there, but the one that gained the most popularity and perhaps, in my opinion, perhaps the one that was theoretically most, well justified was this, what's called the Higgs mechanism.  It was named after Peter Higgs, a Scottish physicist.  There were other people who contributed, but his name, for whatever reason, got attached to it.  So Peter Higgs, the way I would like to describe it is, he postulated that maybe there's this energy field that permeates all of space.  There's a field that fills all of, all of our universe.  Some particles that pass through this energy field interact with it.  And they interact with it in such a way that they gain mass.  They interact with it by exchanging--by the exchange of something called a boson, a Higgs boson is what we'll call it.  And in doing so, they gain mass, whereas other particles pass through it, they don't interact with it.  They just pass right through it, and they're massless.  So this was what we set about to do in these experiments, to see if we could discover this, this boson that describes this interaction that gives particles mass, this Higgs boson.  And we found this, we found evidence for this particle in the data that started--in my opinion, the data we got in 2011 started to show hints of this, this particle.  We knew approximately where to look, if this was the right theory, we knew approximately where to look, but not exactly.  So we looked over this range of energies, of--we call it invariant mass in this channel that we looked in.  And we started to see evidence for it.  And then we kept running and kept studying, and finally we found this particle that looks like the Higgs boson.  Now, why do I say it looks like the Higgs-boson instead of just saying it really is, because the theory doesn't predict the mass of this boson, but it does predict its couplings to particles with great precision.  So we have to see if this really is this Higgs particle or some people call it the God particle.
Story_ID: 26071
Speaker 1: And why do they call it [the Higgs boson] that [the God particle]?
Speaker 2: Okay, let me just say first of all, there are no religious implications or philosophical.  It was the name given to it, and the name, the name was given to it because it was so hard to find.  I think, that's the way I heard it.  The person that I hear most often is, the name attributed to Leon Lederman who is a Nobel laureate [in physics, 1988] and former director at Fermilab [Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois].  And the particle was so hard to find that, that he gave it a name that developed into what's called the "God particle."  That's my understanding of what happened.  So, so the studies continue.  We continue to look at events to see how it couples to all the standard model particles that we know about, to see if it really is the Higgs boson or if it's something else.  There are other ideas.  There are other theories.  This could be something different than the Higgs boson, but it--all our tests so far indicate that it's looking more and more like the, what we call the standard model Higgs boson, right.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so if this does exist the way--I mean it doesn't, I mean there's already a theory of the universe that includes it as a, probably existing, right?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous)--so it doesn't--
Speaker 2: The standard model of particle physics that describes the early universe and how it evolved to where we are today and all these fundamental interactions, this was the final piece of that model, of that theory, this Higgs mechanism.  This mechanism of electro weak symmetry breaking.  And so if it turns out to be that, then this is, this is--this seals the standard model.  This is how we use to describe our universe.  Now, the universe is much more complex than just what the standard model describes.  There's so much more about this universe that we don't understand, dark energy, dark matter, why it is--what caused matter and anti-matter to separate in the early universe?  Why do we happen to live in a universe that's so delicately balanced the way that it is?  There are lots and lots of these different questions that remain, but the standard model wasn't, in its earliest description, it wasn't meant to deal with all that.  So, so what the standard model was meant to do, it does incredibly well, incredibly well, better than anything else that we've ever developed, any model or any framework, theoretical framework.  And this, and this is the last piece of that standard model, this Higgs boson, yeah, so.  It's a great, great achievement.
Story_ID: 26072
Speaker 1: And I wanna make sure you understand.  Yes, I was a part of this [team that discovered the particle that is suggested to be the Higgs boson, in 2012].  I helped to build the detectors that we used to discover it.  I helped to do the analysis.  I helped to commission the [ATLAS (A Toroidal LHC Apparatus) particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland] detector and do the analysis and, and validate the different parts that we use to make this new discovery.  But there were lots of other people involved, lots of people.  Some people worked even longer than I did.  I've been working on this for eighteen years.  There're some people that have been working on this longer that I--much longer than I have.  So a lot of people contributed.  But I was one of them, yes, one of the people who's been with this the longest.
Speaker 2: So you would be like one of, how many would you think?
Speaker 1: Look, if you, if you just be completely intellectually honest, there were probably 6,000 or more people that were involved in this, from all the technicians, all the students, all of the accelerator people, the people who worked on, not just the ATLAS collaboration, but the Compact Muon Solenoid, the CMS collaboration [another particle detector at the LHC], all of them contributed to this.  And the, you know, I also have to include all the spouses, you know, like my wife who would let me travel to Geneva [Switzerland] all these years, you know.  I mean at some level, I should give her credit as well, right, so lots of people contributed.
Speaker 2: Now, but what--
Speaker 1: Seriously, there's lots of scientists, engineers, technicians, over many decades that worked on this.
Speaker 2: The implications of what you're saying are, I think--well, I just know in popular culture, if you're sitting around in the barbershop and people talk about black scientists and inventors.  They say so and so invented this and Garrett Morgan [inventor] invented that, and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and it's like people start from scratch and invent stuff, you know, like--you know, it's almost like--but what you're saying is that what we invent and knowledge is a part of a long chain of--
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: --inheritance of knowledge from one--one person builds on what all the--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --(unclear) starts, and--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  This experiment could not have been done without our understanding of particle physics and of detectors and computing and, and both hardware and software, that was developed over many decades.  It could not have been done.  We had to--we, I say, we, scientists, engineers, technicians had to work and accumulate knowledge over many, many decades in order for us to get to this point, to discover this final missing piece [the Higgs boson] of this standard model of particle physics.  That's right, and the theorists and experimentalists, that's correct.
Speaker 2: And I guess, further, a lot of people, contemporary and in the past, worked on, towards this point.
Speaker 1: That's correct.  That's absolutely correct.
Speaker 2: Okay, so, you know, I don't know.  Other than to just acknowledge it, I think--well, actually, I think a lot of people don't really think of science like that.
Speaker 1: No, that's right, and especially nowadays.  I mean when, when, you know, James Chadwick discovered the neutron [nuclear particle]--well, I say he did.  He worked with a small team.  I think the teams were smaller.  I wasn't there.  This was back in the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s].  So I wasn't there, but the groups tended to be smaller, and even when people like Jerry [Jerome] Friedman [winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, 1990] understand that there were quarks in his electron scattering experiments at SLAC [Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, Stanford University, Palo Alto, California], they were large by the time, by the standards of their day.  But still, they were small.  They were still measured in, you know, you can know everybody on the collaboration.  Collaborations nowadays are just huge.  I mean there are over 3,000 people working just on ATLAS, 3,000 working on CMS or some--of that order.  But I have to say, I wanna make sure and emphasize this, a lot of people worked really hard over a long time to make this happen.  But for me personally, being a part of a new discovery, it's just wonderful.  I mean it's like, you know, I don't know, pick your favorite feeling.  It's just wonderful, being a part of this new discovery and each person that was a part of it can probably tell their story in their own way.  They can embellish it if they want.  So when I talk to my children, my two daughters, and I tell my wife about my role in it, of course, yeah, I say it with great pride (laughter).  It's a great feeling, wonderful feeling.  So.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay--
Speaker 1: It's a real ego boost.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I'd say, even for me, to know that you were a part of it--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --you know, is a boost--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) That's right.
Speaker 2: --you know, so, it's, yeah.
Story_ID: 26073
Speaker 1: So my group, so the other thing I wanted to emphasize is that that, in itself, isn't the end of the story.  So, first of all, my group used this multi-variant analysis, where you can train your computer to recognize what should be these Higgs-like events, versus the background events, the things that have nothing to do with this Higgs [boson] particle.  So because of that, we were able to get greater sensitivity even than the more traditional, what we call "cut-based analysis."  But what's exciting isn't just the discovery of the Higgs boson, but the fact that this may be a portal to a whole new set of phenomena, a whole new world and universal phenomena that we haven't been able to access before.  We know that there's a lot more to this world than just all the stars and galaxies and clusters of galaxies and black holes and planets and moons and all the interstellar gas, all of that combined is just a tiny, tiny fraction, a sliver of the total mass and energy composition of the universe.  So this other part of it, the 95 percent, 93 to 95 percent of the universe that we don't know about, we, we haven't really been able to access it with the other particles in the standard model, photons and Ws and Zs [W boson and Z bosons] and quarks and leptons.  We haven't been able to access it yet.  But now, this new particle, this Higgs-like particle that we've now discovered, it looks like it couples to matter in a way that's unlike anything else that we've ever discovered.  It looks like it's able to interact in a way that's unlike anything else we've discovered.  So what we believe is that this may be a doorway to understand this hidden sector, this dark sector, this, this--whatever this other stuff is in the universe or maybe even other phenomena, we just haven't even thought of yet.  So, so this is the excitement, and this is the direction my group is now taking.  Now, that we've discovered this new Higgs-like particle, we don't quite know yet if it is exactly the standard model Higgs.  But we know it's a new discovery, and we do know that everything about it so far indicates that it couples in a way that's unlike anything else, now we can look for this new phenomena using this as a portal, as a doorway to this new set of phenomena.  And that's what my group and I are looking at now.  So this is at least as exciting as being a part of this, this Higgs-like particle discovery.  Now, we can maybe look for some new stuff that's beyond the standard model, beyond this theory that was, this theoretical framework that was developed to explain the strong, weak and electromagnetic interaction.  So it's an exciting time.  This is a great time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's a wonderful time.
Story_ID: 26074
Speaker 1: All right, so I wanna go back a little bit and just try to catch up a little bit on the career.  In 2000, I guess, you received the Edward Bouchet [physicist] Award--
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: --from the American Physical Society [APS].
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: That's all the physicists, right, of America?
Speaker 2: I think it's mainly for minority physicists, African American, Hispanic, minority physicists.
Speaker 1: Oh, American Physical Society?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right, but the American--APS, right, is for all the physicists, for all of the American--
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Bouchet Award, yeah, it's given by APS.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It's given by the American Physical Society, yep, that's right--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: It's for, it's an award for the, you know, black (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: For contributions made by minority physicists, right.
Speaker 1: Right, and Edward Bouchet.  Tell us about him.
Speaker 2: Edward Bouchet was the first African American to get a Ph.D. in the United States in any subject.  It just so happened to be that the subject was physics and it was right here at Yale University [New Haven, Connecticut].  Yale awarded him the Ph.D. in physics in 1860-something, I believe, '65 [1865]--I could have the, the--or maybe it was in the '70s, 1870s [1874].  Anyway, and, and he was one of the very first Americans to get a Ph.D. in physics.  He, I think, Josiah Willard Gibbs was one [Yale awarded Gibbs the first American doctorate in engineering, in 1863].  He was here at Yale [University].  Edward Bouchet was here at Yale, so this is, this award, this Edward Bouchet Award from the APS [American Physical Society] was given to acknowledge that and to celebrate that fact.
Speaker 1: So one of the first to get a Ph.D.--the first to get a Ph.D., period, was African--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The first African American to get a Ph.D., period.
Speaker 1: --and one of the first Ph.D.s in physics ever, right--
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct--
Speaker 1: --that's on two things (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --in the United States, that's correct.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  Where was Bouchet from and what did he--do you know what happened to him?
Speaker 2: He was from, let's see.  That's a good question.  I do remember that after he got his Ph.D., he went and taught, he taught physics.  I think he stayed in this area and taught physics for a while.  He taught at the high school level, as I recall.  And then, I think he may have moved to Illinois.  I knew that, I read up on this, I read his biography, and now I forget some of the details.  But he, he taught, he taught.  That was his, that was his, you know, his activity when he got his Ph.D., to teach physics--
Speaker 1: Right, I think--
Speaker 2: --his career.
Speaker 1: --correct me if I'm wrong, but I think his opportunities were not great--
Speaker 2: That's correct, I think that's right.
Speaker 1: --based on the level he achieved.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  I think that's right.  I think the opportunities to become a full tenured professor of physics at Yale were--or any Ivy League or any university at that time were limited compared to what they are today.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 26075
Speaker 1: So here on the campus at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].  Now, you joined the faculty here at Yale in 2006, right?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: And, now, how did that take place and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's an interesting story in itself.  So I was at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia] and [Thomas] Jefferson [National] Lab in Virginia and I had been asked to serve on a committee--one of the federal agencies in Washington [District of Columbia] asked me to serve on a committee to get a new associate director.  And we considered a number of really just, just outstanding scientists to be the associate director of this, of this agency.  And one of the people on that, that we were considering was a professor here at Yale.  And they asked me to call him and engage his interests.  So I called him up, and said, we were interested in getting an associate director and the committee is really interested to see if you're interested in such a position and if we could interview you?  And he emailed me back and said, no, I'm not interested.  He said a lot of other things too, but he said, I'm not interested.  And then, but he wanted to talk to me.  So I called him on the phone, and we talked, and he explained--I, so I had met him once before as well because I'd served on another committee to try to get him to be director of a major laboratory, a major lab in this country.  And he was a really impressive guy, smart, smooth, skilled, poised, everything.  So we talked about that for a while.  So anyway, as the conversation ended, we--I was ready to hang up.  He said he wasn't interested, and as were about to hang up, he said, "Wait, wait, before you go.  I wanna turn the tables.  He said, we have an opening for a particle physicist here, a professor.  We wanna make a senior appointment in particle physics on our faculty, and are you interested?  And I told him I didn't know that they had an open search, but I sent him a resume and I sent him a proposal for the kind of research that I wanted to do.  And shortly after that, they invited me to come up and interview, and then shortly after that, they made an offer.  So, and that's how I ended up here.
Speaker 1: Okay, 2006--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So was it difficult to leave Hampton with so much going on--
Speaker 2: Normally, yes, because we really enjoyed our time there.  It was just a wonderful time for my family, but, look, this was Yale [University], man.  I mean opportunities like this come along once in a, once in a generation.  And to be quite honest with you, Yale was one of these places that I always considered to be sort of off limits.  It was something that, you know, you just--you don't think about because it's not an opportunity--I mean that wasn't reality.  But that was just because of the baggage that I carried and what was in my mind.  So I never really thought about it until he, this professor made it known to me, this is a possibility.  Are you interested?  And so when they made the offer, I absolutely, there was no hesitation.  I took it.  I, as great as our lives were, my family and myself, as great as our lives were there, it just couldn't compare to this opportunity because it was just a wonderful opportunity.  I talked it over with my wife.  She wasn't extremely happy about leaving Hampton Roads [the Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, Virginia-North Carolina metropolitan area which surrounds it in southeastern Virginia].  But she understood the importance of this appointment.
Story_ID: 26076
Speaker 1: Now, what makes the difference?
Speaker 2: Everything.  So, so don't get me wrong.  I had just some tremendously talented colleagues in Virginia [Hampton University and Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory; JLab].  They were just tremendously bright, hardworking, talented, focused on their research experience.  And I enjoyed working with them.  I learned from them, but then when I came to Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut, in 2006], it was like, there's just an environment that is just different.  So when I got my office over in the building over at the [J.W.] Gibbs Lab, the person right down the hall from me, he discovered the antiproton as a graduate student.  He discovered it.  And this, and then the person across the hall from me, won a--the Nobel Prize in physics some years ago was awarded for the discovery of CP [Charge Parity] Violation in the kaon system.  Well, this guy across the hall from me was the very first in the world to see this evidence with CP Violation.  And he's right across the hall from me.  And, you know, and I can go and talk to these guys and, and I'd get up and get to work in the morning.  And we'd go and have coffee, and I'd ask them questions like, you know, what was it like?  What did you do?  If there's one thing you could pluck out of all the stories, what is it that you would say is what led you to make this new discovery?  What was the crucial action that you took?  So, and then as a young, as a young professor at Hampton [University] and Jefferson Lab, I worked on an experiment, my first high-energy physics experiment at Brookhaven [National] Lab [Upton, New York].  I was able to do that for a couple of years.  Well, the guy that was the head of that experiment was right across the hall from me, another professor here.  And I'd go and talk to him.  You know, he was a big-time professor, and I was a little junior faculty member.  And now, we're equals, right.  He's a professor, I'm a professor.  So I just go across the hall and talk to him now.  So that kind of environment, it brings with it, it brought with it for me, just an advantage that I just felt like I wouldn't have had if I had not come here, in particle physics.  I mean if I had wanted to just stay in medium-energy nuclear physics, then, yeah, staying in Virginia was probably the thing to do.  But if I wanted to do particle physics at this level, like at ATLAS [A Toroidal LHC Apparatus; particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland], and be a part of this new discovery at this level, the way that I was, this was the place to be.  And that's what I did.  I came here.  So, it's interesting.  The person who was the chair at the time, [Ramamurti] Shankar, he was the department chair at the time when they made the offer--when we were discussing coming here.  And so I had been involved, I had been at Hampton and Jefferson Lab for many years, and I had had some discussions with other universities about possibly joining their faculty.  But in each case with these other universities, they were saying, well, why don't you come and spend a year with us and, you know, you get to look at us, and we get to look at you, and let's see if this is a good fit.  So when I got to Yale, I mean when I started talking with the Yale department chair in physics, I thought this was gonna be one of those kind of discussions, where he'd say, well, why don't you come and spend a year and, you know, we'll look at you.  And so he kept saying to me, you know, Keith, if we make you this offer, are you really gonna take it?  And I kept saying to him, well, are you guys gonna really make a real offer or is this gonna be one of these, you know, play kind of offers that I can ignore?  So we went back and forth on that (unclear), but they made the offer, and I took it.  I was very happy.  It was one of the, just tremendous.  Just the opportunity to be here, work with the people that I do, the students and post-docs and my colleagues, it's just, it's--some, you know, it's just a tremendous, wonderful environment, and wonderful opportunity.  So.
Story_ID: 26077
Speaker 1: So, now, is it true that however you're being stripped by, or enriched by this experience, you're able to then, I guess, reverberate some of that back to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and other schools?
Speaker 2: That's right.  I mean I have to be careful here.  I'm now a faculty member at Yale, so I don't work for any other university.  I work for this university now.  But if there are times when I can be of help and service to, to the African American community at large at other universities, sure, I do that, sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Because--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And to Yale, and to here at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.  And one of the questions I had here that was, did any of the Hampton students work on the ATLAS [A Toroidal LHC Apparatus; particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) in Switzerland] Project?
Speaker 2: Yes, they did, yes.  So, we had several undergrad [undergraduates] students and several graduate students that were just--I mean this was just a real success story.  We were able to come in and help to build this detector, and I had high school students.  I had undergrad students and graduate students.  And we helped, we built it and built some of the modules right there at Hampton, a large fraction of the modules.  We also commissioned it.  We, you know, they went over to Geneva [Switzerland] and helped to install it, and then when we got, first used cosmograted [unclear] muons to commission it, and then when the first splash of events came, to commission it using these actually high-energy protons.  It was just a, yeah, yep, so lots of students and post-docs at Hampton University also contributed, yes, and did just wonderful work.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you work with undergraduate students at all here at Yale--
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, undergraduates and graduate students, yes, I do.
Speaker 1: And are you--we've asked everybody we've interviewed, I guess, basically, if they've been able to sheppard through another black Ph.D.
Speaker 2: I have not shepparded through another black Ph.D. since I've been here at Yale, but I have worked with some undergraduates who have gone on to graduate school.  So one example is a young guy who worked with me on--it was an experiment here on the Yale campus looking for--we were trying to look for this hidden sector of physics, coupling of photons to this hidden sector, particles, and he worked with me on that.  And now he's a graduate student at Stanford.  But, no, I have not had an African American Ph.D. student here at Yale yet, not yet.  We're working on--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really like both of the people we've interviewed.  They give one or two in their whole career, through, you know--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --that's not easy.
Speaker 2: It's a challenge, but, you know, my colleagues here are very interested in getting increasing diversity, both in the faculty and in the student population here.  So we're working on it, we're working on it.  These things can take time, but we're working on it, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26078
Speaker 1: Describe the A. W. Wright [Nuclear Structure] Lab here [Department of Energy (DOE)-funded accelerator laboratory for nuclear physics research, at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], I guess, for us?
Speaker 2: The Wright Nuclear Structure Lab was, it was the brain child of [David] Allan Bromley who was the former science advisor to President--, the first President [George H.W.] Bush, and he's an experimental nuclear physicist and a policymaker.  So at that time--this was decades ago, the way to do nuclear physics was to build what we call, what are now low-energy machines.  At the time, they were very high energy, but the accelerators have progressed in energy now so that this is a low-energy machine.  So this is a Van de Graaff [tandem Van de Graaff accelerator] and it's, the way it works is, it accelerates particles from very low energy up to tens of MED, million elect--tens of millions of electron volts.  At the time, when we were running, this was the world's most powerful, stand-alone Van de Graaff, tandem Van de Graaff.  And it was just a great facility.  We were running in excess of 4,000 hours a year, had users from all over the country coming in.  But nuclear physics, nuclear physics as a whole, as a field was making a transition away from this kind of nuclear physics to a different kind of nuclear physics.  The, the questions that we were asking in nuclear physics continue to be fundamental, but maybe these kind of machines weren't the best way to get at these answers.  So, so the decision was made to stop running this tandem Vandergrift and to transition it to something new.  And so the university president and the university provost here at Yale [University] asked me to transition this laboratory, from the nuclear structure-based, tandem-based nuclear structure lab to something new, something that is more in line with what are these fundamental questions that we're asking in nuclear physics now, and what are the best ways to answer them.  So when I took over as director, the first thing that I did was to speak to some of the senior members in the department here.  What do you think are the most important questions in this field that we can answer and what should Yale be involved with?  Yale may not do everything, but what are the most important ones, and then what does Yale have to do to answer these questions or to be a part of the solution.  So I talked with my senior colleagues in the department, and then I started talking to people outside of Yale.  I started talking to my colleagues in nuclear physics at other institutions and other laboratories.  And then so that whole process took about a year and then I went down to the funding agencies.  I had set up a meeting in Washington [District of Columbia] with people from the [U.S.] Department of Energy [DOE] and National Science Foundation [NSF] to tell them, this is the direction we're gonna take.  This is the new direction.  It's not gonna be nuclear structure at low energies.  It's gonna be more weekly interacting particles and fields.  So we wanna answer some questions about what are neutrinos telling us?  What is this dark matter?  Is there a WIMP [weakly-interacting massive particles] dark matter?  Is there axion dark matter?  These, these are technical terms that don't really matter so much, but the point was, and can we understand if these neutrinos that we're studying in our laboratories now, are they their own antiparticle are there separate particles and antiparticles?  So these are the kind of questions that my colleagues and I in the department felt like, these are the kind of questions we want to tackle.  These are fundamental questions that we have to understand in order to make progress in this field.  And Yale can do this.  So, so this was the thing that I presented to the agencies.  And then I've spent the last year and a half to two years trying to transition this laboratory, to do that kind of physics.  And one of the most important things to do is to go out and hire some people who can come here and help us do this.  So we are trying to hire two people now.  The university has supported me just, just wonderfully, and we hope to make an offer to two young people to join us to, to continue this transition and to study weekly interacting particles and fields.  This is where we're going, the direction we're taking.
Speaker 1: You were on the ground floor of establishing the Jefferson Accelerator [Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, Virginia], right?
Speaker 2: That's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: And then the, and on the ground floor of re-making this one?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's correct, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's correct.  That's what the president asked me to do, yeah.  I didn't have a long talk with the [Yale University] president.  Obviously, he talked and I listened, but he told me in general terms, he left it up to me how I wanted to transition it.  The few things he told me was that he wanted us to have an effort that was inclusive.  He wanted it to be something exciting when it, more than just a few of us in a small sub-field would do it, but that it be more generally attractive to scientists in general and in a wider community.  And so, I've kept that kind mind, yeah.
Story_ID: 26079
Speaker 1: We always ask this question in this way.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point, and you're still a young man here by some standards (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Wow (laughter), let's go with that, okay.
Speaker 1: We interviewed a ninety-four year old yesterday so--
Speaker 2: Okay, (unclear) well, let's go with that, all right.
Speaker 1: So what would you consider to be your professional legacy at this juncture?
Speaker 2: Well, I think the jury is still out on Baker.  I don't think that I'm ready to say yet, this is my chief contribution to science.  I, that's a judgment that will have to wait, I hope, for some time because the--what I'm working on now is the most exciting thing that I've ever worked on.  So, I--let's see where this takes me.  It could lead nowhere.  I've worked on projects that have led nowhere, but let's see where this leads me.  The jury is still out that question.  Let's see where it goes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We've interviewed a lot of people in science who at one time were keenly into research, and then they seem to slide over to administration--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and they're doing that more than anything else.  Now, you don't see--I don't think you see this happening to you any time soon.
Speaker 2: I'm going to resist it.  I'm going to resist that, no.  I will say though that the other thing that has happened here at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] is my--the president and the provost here, as you can imagine, they're just world-class leaders, just outstanding leaders.  And so they're very persuasive.  So they asked me to take on this position, and they're very good at getting their faculty to do what the faculty maybe wouldn't have thought of beforehand.  So I, I'm leaving open the possibility that I may not always be a researcher, but while I am a researcher, yes, I'm just enjoying it.  I don't wanna stop.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, there is a difference, I guess.  The people we interviewed that are physicists at an HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] often have to be drawn into administration--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And it's just--the resources just aren't there to support--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --the work that a Yale can do, I guess--
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.  And that's another benefit of being at a Yale that, you know, the resources allow me to continue to do research at this level at my age.  That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, just, so there's a lot more for you to do in this capacity, I hope.
Speaker 2: Absolutely, absolutely.  I don't mean to imply that I will, that I shun administration or that I--I do support my president and provost.  There's a new president.  It's an interesting story.  When I got here, the person who is now the president-elect [Peter Salovey], he was the dean.  He was a dean at the time.  And when I got here, the first few weeks after I got here, he sent an email saying that he wanted to meet with me.  And, and, of course, I'd go to meet with--said, sure, I'll come to meet with you.  And I went in expecting him to give me the long speech about the Yale tradition and how I'm a part of something that dates back, you know, centuries, and that I'm part of something big.  So you can imagine my surprise when I walked in and sat down, and he said, he began to tell me how fortunate that Yale felt that they could attract me here and how happy he was that I accepted their offer and that, all that I brought to the University and he then asked me, Keith, what can I do to help you do what you already do, to do even better?  And, you know, I sat there in stunned silence for a few minutes, and, you know, I just wanted to tell that story that, you know, ever since then, you know, I'm a big fan of our new president.  And I think he knows that.  So if he asked me to do something that I hadn't thought about doing, you know, if he asked me to go into administration, I, I--this isn't what I want to do with my life, administration.  I want to continue to do the research that I'm doing now, but at some point in my life, yes, I will have to consider that--I don't know what age it'll happen.  But let's just pick a number.  It's hard for a ninety-year old man to do physics with the same intensity, sustained over many hours, every day for years as a thirty or forty year old man or woman, right.  So, I keep that in mind, but thankfully, I haven't reached that point yet.  So, you're right, I do wanna continue to do what I'm doing now.  The research is just tremendously exciting.  It's an exciting time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26080
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Right, so, I think in the African American community, the part of the African American community that I, that I spend a lot of time interacting with, they have an interest in what these young people are interested in.  They just do it just--they just become the world's best at what they do.  They're just so excited about what they do, the ones that go on into what it is that they want to do, whether it be in science, whether it be in engineering, whether it be in entertainment or athletics or whether it be in some kind of professional career.  I've just really been impressed at, at what they do, and, again, I think that sometimes they do it under the kind of pressure that, and intense scrutiny, you know, where people are looking for them to make mistakes.  I'm just impressed with that, you know, that they're able to handle this.  And I think they may do it in a way that I wasn't able to, like, at--when I was younger like that.  So that impresses me.  So I don't, the fact that some of my colleagues said, well, what can we do to get more African Americans in physics, to increase the diversity here or elsewhere?  I don't see that as a problem.  I think people should do what they love doing.  They should, they, you know--my, both my daughters, I tried to, I tried really hard, I tried really hard to get them excited about physics, and to go into physics.  But they're doing something else.  They're doing what they love, and I say, "great, wonderful."  So, I don't see these as problems.  I think the ones that do want to go into physics, I do try to provide an environment here at Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and elsewhere to help them to go into physics, the same way people helped me when I was younger.  But that's, that's about the extent of it.  I think some of the broader issues that you may be asking me about, having to do with broader parts of our community, where there are problems--and there're problems in every community.  It's not just the African American community.  There are people better able to answer that than I am.  I don't have, if there is a problem that's worse in our community, having to do with drugs or unwed or teenage pregnancies and other kinds of things, I couldn't add anything to what's already been said.  Studies have been made to address these kind of issues.  So.  I think, I would like for more African Americans to know the opportunities they have at a place like Yale or an Ivy League institution.  If they're anything like me, it may have just been the baggage that I carried--I didn't think this was--it wasn't until recently within the past ten years or so that I began to see this as a real opportunity, an option for me, being a tenured professor in an Ivy League institution, institution of this caliber.  I was very happy where I was, and I didn't think about leaving until it was pointed out to me, here's an opportunity.  Would you take it?  So, sure.
Story_ID: 26081
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point in life, is there any major thing that you would change or, you know--
Speaker 2: The only things I would change have to do with my family.  I, I would have been, you know, there were times when I was--especially, when I was younger, that I would come home, and I would be just so tired, just worn out, just exhausted, and my daughters would tell me something that they were so excited about.  And, you know, I'm listening to them while I'm about to fall asleep.  I would change that.  I think, you know, and the few times that there may have been activities that they were involved with--it didn't happen a lot.  But it has happened and, you know, that I had to miss, yeah, those are things that I regret.  There was one instance--here's a funny story.  There was one instance, my youngest daughter was in high school at the time.  And she was a part of some--she either was a part of or was going to some musical event.  And you had to have tickets to go to this event, right?  So I had to go to Geneva.  I had to go give a talk or something at CERN [European Organization for Nuclear Research, Geneva, Switzerland], and then I made sure I put these tickets--we bought the tickets.  I put them in my wallet so I said, I'm not gonna lose these, and I'm gonna be here for this event.  And my daughter--it meant so much to my daughter.  And so on the way back from Geneva, back to Connecticut, the plane got struck by lightning.  I don't know if it was actually struck, but the lightening hit close enough that they had to turn the plane around.  We had to have some kind of a landing.  They had all these fire trucks and the fire brigade and emergency medical people waiting for us.  And in the end, I mean, I didn't, I think I smelled smoke, but I didn't see any fire or anything.  But, so we had to, had to go to another city.  They got taxis to take us to Leone (unclear), I guess, and catch another flight.  So I got here a day after this musical event for my daughter.  So, I always remembered that, that I just hated that.  And they couldn't go either because I had the tickets in my wallet.  So, it was (laughter) just a disaster.  I wish I could have changed that.  But, anyway, I took her to the mall and spent a lot of money on her.  She was, forgave me, I guess, I don't know.

Speaker 1: One of the things, when I was younger that I asked some prominent physicists--so I wanted to pass on two different lessons that I've learned.  And these aren't--this isn't advice.  These are just observations.  So, I once met Leon Lederman, who's a Nobel laureate [Nobel Prize in Physics, 1988].  I've met other Nobel laureates, but he, he was one--and I've always asked them questions, but I--and I also asked Jerome Friedman this question, Jerry Friedman was a Nobel laureate [Nobel Prize in Physics, 1990].  And I happened to know him.  He was a professor of mine from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I asked them both, if you could sum up in one phrase, one remark, what you considered to be the one action you took or characteristic you have that has enabled you to achieve the success that you have, a Nobel Prize in Physics, what would it be?  So I was interested that Leon Lederman said, take your physics seriously, but don't take yourself so seriously.  And Jerome Friedman told me, always let physics be your guide.  There are lots of ideas, lots of theories; you can listen to all of them, but at the end of the day, the physics is what is physics.  And that's your guide, not all these theories and ideas.  And that's one observation.  The second observation was, when I was in Virginia trying to get this Physics Frontier Center [funde3d by the national Science Foundation (NSF)], now, it worked out just tremendously successfully.  It was just a wonderful success in my life, and I wanna make sure you understand that.  But the road to success was, there, it could--it was difficult at times.  So I remember that after this big competition to get these, to get the people who were going to be awarded these Frontier Centers, they narrowed it down to four of us.  And we were the only HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities].  So the other centers that, the other people who were going to get their centers funded, they got the funding that they asked for.  Yet, they delayed us by a year because I hadn't developed the right project execution plan.  They wanted some more details about what I was going to do and how I was going to structure the center, and it was good that they did.  So, but at the time, I remember just being so frustrated.  I was like, you know, these other people, I don't understand.  We all got through this competition at the same time.  Why are they able to go forward and I'm not?  So I remember going to my supervisor, the head of the physics division at Jefferson Lab [Thomas Jefferson National Laboratory, JLab, Virginia] at the time.  And I was just livid.  I said, you know, this is going to confirm everyone's worst fears about the agency putting this kind of money at HBCUs and, and I'm being treated unfairly, and, you know, and I don't know why I was telling him this.  He was a, I guess it was because he was a colleague of the person who was over physics, over the math and physical sciences at the time.  I don't know.  But anyway, what was interesting was, he was eating lunch, and so he turned around from eating his lunch, and he listened to me.  And then after I finished with my tirade, he told me about some of his experiences as a professor at a prominent university in the North.  He told me about how he had spent a decade or more working on this project that he had given up weekends and holidays and time away with his family, and in the end, the project got cancelled.  He came away with nothing.  And he told me other stories about people who had sacrificed for years and had worked harder than, you know, I probably had experienced at the time, and they came away with nothing.  So he looked me in the eye, and then he says, so, you know, I want you to stop whining and just do what you gotta do.  Stop whining to me about how tough life is (laughter), and then he turned around and continued to eat his lunch.  So I remembered that because that really helped me.  I just felt like he was right.  I was, I felt like I was being mistreated, and I wasn't.  This was a white gentleman and he was saying, you know, the majority community goes through this too.  What makes you think you're the only one that faces hard times?  And so that also stuck with me all these years, and he was right.  In the end, it just worked out really successfully.  The agencies were simply trying to help me to make a better center than what I had originally envisioned.  And that's exactly what happened.  It was a tremendous success.  So those are the two observations I wanted to just leave with you--
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --for if anyone want to view this and if it's useful for them.  It's not advice.  These are just things that, you know, observations.
Story_ID: 26083
Speaker 1: In terms of advice, do you have any advice for black physics students?
Speaker 2: Yes, I think you should find what you enjoy doing and find what you're good at, and that's what you should do.  Find out what you're good at and find out what you enjoy doing.  And when those two meet, that's what you should follow.
Speaker 1: Okay, so if you don't like doing it, and you don't, you're not interested in it, you probably shouldn't deal with it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that's right.  I think that's not the best combination.  If you're really talented at something, but your heart isn't in it, and you don't like it, that's not the best recipe for success.  And at the same time, if it's something that you really, really like, but I won't say that people don't have a talent for it, but there're some things that take a long time, you know--I once heard a remark that it takes like 10,000 hours to be an expert at something.  You have to do something for 10,000 hours, and I don't know where I heard this from.  But if there's any truth to that statement, then, you know, I ask students who come and say I wanna do this kind of physics.  I say, are you willing to give up your weekends and holidays for the next five years in your life or ten years in your life?  Are you willing to work, you know, sort of 360 days a week, a year, ten hours a day?  Are you willing to do that and, and put that kind of, that level of, you know, commitment into this project?  And if you're not, then you have to understand that you're going to be competing with some people who are willing to do that.  Are you willing, are you able to compete with them, to rise to this level?  So, so, yeah, I think the best combination, if it's something that you really, really enjoy and that you're really good at, yes.  I think that's the best combination.  So, if you can find that, run with it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26084
Speaker 1: All right, now, tell us something about your family?  You've got two daughters?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, so I have two daughters.  One is twenty-six and one is twenty-one years old.  And my wife and I have been married for twenty-seven years and we met in Houston [Texas], and my wife, her background is in psychology.  She has an advanced degree in psychology and counseling and, which is good because she's always willing to share that expertise in helping me to sort of stay on a path.  I think that, you know, doing physics the way that I do physics, the kind of focus and dedication--the way that I do it, all physicists are focused and dedicated at some level.  But I guess--okay, she helps me understand that, you know, interacting with other people requires a certain skill set that, you know, you need to develop.  And if you're going to go on in this field, it's not just a matter of you going into your laboratory burying your, you know, your head in all this bag full of bolts and cables.  You're also going to have to learn to deal with people in a certain way and understand their needs, their perspectives.  And she helps me with that.  I think her psychology background helps, helps me in that way and other ways.  She really has been just a, she's just a tremendous woman.  And then my daughters, again, as I told you, I really wanted them to go into physics.  When they were younger, I used to take them to movies like, with women in strong roles, scientific roles, like 'Contact' with Jodi Foster.  And I remember I'd get books, and I'd read books to them about women in strong roles in science.  But my oldest daughter is in, she's in the healthcare profession, and my youngest daughter wants to go into writing, creative writing and English.  So, so there you have it.  That's my family.
Speaker 1: Okay, maybe she'll produce the next 'Contact' (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, so, that's right.  That's probably what she said.  Maybe I'll be a playwright, yeah, (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26085
Speaker 1: All right, now, is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about, you think, before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not at all--
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: --not at all.
Speaker 1: All right, well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a talented physicist.  And that's why I say the jury is still out.  I've done, I've done--if you would ask me what are the few things that I've done, I mean if you would ask me what have I done that I'm very proud of, there are only a few things.  I mean I've worked hard over many years, but there are a few things, just a handful of things, I'd say, okay, this was really, this was really impactful.  However, I would like to be known as a talented--
Speaker 1: Well, what are those things?  I'm not gonna skip past that because this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure, I measured this first large nuclear resonance effect in atomic electron capture.  That was my dissertation.  The first measurement of this sticking probability in muon catalyzed fusion, we were the first to measure that.  And I was the post-doc [postdoctoral researcher] on that now, experiment.  The first measurement of these elementary amplitudes and kaon electro-production and now this discovery of this Higgs boson.  And again, a lot of very talented people worked on these with me.  I wasn't the only one, but, and, now, the experiments that I'm involved with, both at the LHC [large Haldron Collider] and here on campus have the potential to eclipse all of them in importance.  And so I'm just--that, that profession is what I'd like to perhaps be known as a, you know, a talented--you know, a person who was really good at his craft, talented person.  And then, of course, as a human being, a good husband and a good father, brother, and, yeah, that means a lot to me, yeah.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: It's my pleasure.  Yeah, thank you, thank you.
