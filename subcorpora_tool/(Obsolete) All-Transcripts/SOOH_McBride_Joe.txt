 Little Thunder  McBride  Today is Thursday, March 24, 2011, and I   m interviewing Mr. Joe  McBride with the Gallery of Art, located in Anadarko. This interview is  part of the Oklahoma Native Arts Project, sponsored by Oklahoma Oral  History  Research  Program at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater.  Mr. McBride, you are the publisher of the Anadarko Daily News. You   re  an inductee of the Oklahoma Journalism Hall of Fame, but you also  wear another hat, which is owner of an Indian Art Gallery, which has  been very important to many Southern Plains Indian artists in the area.  Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Well, I was born in Oklahoma City, in 1929. I   ve lived in Clinton, Elk  City, Hobart, Walters, and came to Anadarko in 1937. This has been  home base ever since, even though I   ve served overseas in the military  and worked in other newspapers here in Oklahoma. My father and his  business partner, the late James C. Nance, owned between them the  controlling interest in thirty-four Oklahoma newspapers, which  Anadarko Daily News is a surviving side of the McBride properties.  (Laughter) So, I   ve been here ever since.  So, you went to middle school and high school here?  No, we moved here   I was in the third grade in the fall of 1937. I went  to school here through sophomore year in high school. My folks wanted  me to get a more thorough education, so they sent me to the Oklahoma  Military Academy. I did volunteer to go. (Laughter) I wasn   t forced to  go. I enjoyed it, and it really changed my life.  And that was in Claremore, Oklahoma.  In Claremore, and I was there four years, two years of high school, two  years of junior college. I graduated in the upper 10 percent of my college  5  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  graduating class, which there were just eighteen, so that   s 1.8, 10  percent. (Laughter)  You mentioned it really changed your life.  Well, I, of course, was in those formative years. It made a tremendous  impact on me in determination. For instance, I learned to study. Up until  I went to OMA, I just coasted through school. I got pretty good grades. I  wasn   t a great scholar, by any means, even then, at OMA, although I  made much better grades, I did have some as low as C. I did win an  award for the highest grade in a college division in foreign language.  That   s wonderful. What was your first exposure to Indian culture, that  you remember?  Well, of course, I was always fascinated by them, Indians. Really, the  biggest impression made on me was an American Indian Exposition that  I saw for the first time in August of 1938.  And that was here in Anadarko?  It   s been at Anadarko ever since   and before that as far as I can   I  think it started in    31. But I just grew up with them.  Do you remember when you saw your first painting by an Indian artist?  Not specifically, but we were exposed to it at all times. We got into the  gallery business almost by default. We did an inventory for insurance  purposes and found out we owned 165 Indian paintings that we   d  acquired over the years. So, we started buying Indian paintings and  artifacts and beadwork and things like that. Opened up the Gallery of Art  in Anadarko in 1983 in another location. We were in two locations  before we wound up here. We bought this building with the idea that  we   d move the newspaper into it. I didn   t know there was going to be a  fire  that   d  burn the newspaper down and move us into it, anyways.  And we   ll talk about that. I   d like to hear a little more about how you  began acquiring Indian art  Well, part of it, we ran ads in the newspaper and mostly  bought  at least  95 percent, maybe more, of these paintings here out of a fifty-mile  circle. Very local artists for all practical purposes. Very few from  somewhere else. Only  one  that I remember right off hand non-Indian  painting in the whole collection. But, like I say, my last count was 165  paintings.  6  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  You and your wife, were you both interested in collecting? Was it mainly  you?  Well, she   s interested in it, but not active, other than making some  suggestions from time to time.  So, you wouldn   t run your purchases by her? You wouldn   t say,    I like  this one, do you?     Well, I learned not to buy everything that came in and not to buy just  things that I liked. Not that I   m a great expert on it. Most of what I     that   s in here, I like. There   s some of it that   I can remember one  painting, which was half-human, half-skull, I didn   t like it. Believe it or  not, it sold. So, I don   t know. (Laughter)  That was as a gallery owner, but before, when you were a collector,  what type of work appealed to you?  Well, again, we just acquired paintings. Artists would come to us. We  had a fairly high profile. And that   s how we got that first 165 paintings.  The cost was very competitive to what they cost today, I might add. I  started way back in   I came back here in July, August of 1955. So,  those paintings were collected in that period from 1955 to 1983. One  thing about it, it   s a gallery of original art. We have prints, but not many.  Original art is non-competitive. They like it or they don   t like it, they  want it or they don   t want it. You have something they like or you don   t.  So, it   s a simple decision. I will admit that over the years, I   ve looked at  a lot of art galleries with some idea that we could get into an art gallery  and not be competitive with the advertisers in the newspaper. See, that  was a point that we wanted to make. There weren   t any art galleries at  that time, anyway.  You mentioned that the prices were competitive with what they are now,  and I wondered what you meant by that.  It   s hard to explain. Minimum wage was a dollar. So, where a painting  now might sell for   I purchase it wholesale. I tell them that I   m a low-dollar  buyer, and we buy primarily from the artists themselves. Don   t  take the paintings off the wall and bring them down to us. Twenty  dollars for a painting  then , that would be sixty or eighty dollars  now .  So, proportionate to the income you were making, it was a little bit of a  sacrifice?  Well, we use the standard markup. And, of course, the longer   it   s an  7  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  argument that I have with some insurance people about depreciation of  art. Art doesn   t depreciate, it appreciates. And curiously enough, the  older it is, the more valuable. That   s all art, not just Indian paintings.  Back to those original 165 paintings, some of those came pretty  reasonable, like ten or fifteen dollars. Some of them were pretty good  paintings and some of them were not so good. They weren   t large, most  of them. They were small, relatively speaking.  Were any of them by some of the better known artists?  A lot of them, even like that one over there, Larry Hood. Larry   s dead,  died in    95. (Gestures) I bought a lot of his paintings, sold a lot of them.  He   s Rance Hood   s brother. We   ve sold all of our paintings that  belonged to Rance, and he   s still alive.  So,  Rance  was already out of Oklahoma when you started your  gallery. He hadn   t been living in Oklahoma   ?  No, he was living in Colorado.  Did you ever come across any paintings by the Kiowa Five Painters?  We had a few, very few. Of course, Steve Mopope  was  still alive  until  1974 , but not painting. So, we acquired some paintings. Part of that  165, quite a few of them were from the Kiowa Five. No particular  reasons. They were the only ones working.  Let   s pick up a bit on your newspaper business, and then I   d like to come  back to Anadarko and the Indian art scene in the gallery here. When you  graduated then, from the Military Academy     After OMA, I completed my college degree at OU  Oklahoma  University  and graduated in the class of 1951.  Did you take any art classes, by chance, or art history?  No, I majored in journalism and minored in business. (Laughter)  That was a useful background.  My dad, in spite of being part owner of thirty-four newspapers, never  took a journalism course in his life. But he was a business school  graduate. It is a business, and I   ve always treated it as such. The  gallery   I have an argument with people at times, whether it   s a hobby  or a business   but it is a business. It   s intended to pull its own weight.  It   s tricky. There in the    80s, it was really good. The boom, the oil boom  8  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  was on, right around here. A lot of Indians sell paintings by size. That   s  not necessarily a good judgment of a good Indian painting. I   ve seen  some that are palm size that are very valuable, as far as I   m concerned.  And some large paintings aren   t worth the canvas they   re painted on.  So, even though you started in the    80s, which was when the Indian art  market was booming, there weren   t any other Indian galleries in town?  What were the places that sold Indian art here in town?  I think the Susan Peters Gallery was here, but it wasn   t exclusively  Indian paintings. It had all kinds of things. I may be wrong about that     I really don   t know when they were established. But they were into more  than just artwork.  Was Southern Plains Indian Museum selling paintings?  Southern Plains, yes, they were. In fact, they were the principle place,  and they just didn   t buy much. They didn   t have the display space. They  encouraged it. Of course, they   ve been here since the    50s. But, again,  they didn   t have as much gallery space as we   ve got in this room.  So, McKee   s Indian Store was around at that time, too.  That I remember, yes. They were more into the Indian costumes and  things of that nature. Artifacts more so than paintings, which we were  primarily in the painting business. Still are.  When you said that you were careful, you didn   t want to encroach on  someone else   s territory that was an advertiser in the paper?  Yes, we didn   t want to interfere with   we wanted to bring something to  the community and create something. Something that was needed,  really.  So, what was the reception like by the townspeople? How did they  receive the gallery?  Well, I think that we were well received, particularly as a place to come  look. But then, they had the same access to Indian artwork we do.  From the individual painters?  Oh, yeah. A lot of people have paintings of their own that are quite  valuable.  Your first pieces of Indian art you sold from the gallery, were they  9  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  equally divided between locals and out-of-towners? Or between  dealers?  Well, I usually say the fifty-mile circle. That would take in Lawton. The  KCA Reservation. Yes, some of them, they have roots here. The Hood  brothers did, for instance. Most of them   we just bought what walked  through the front door.  But in terms of your buyers, people who were  coming in to buy from  you, were most of them locals? Or did most of them come from other  places?  It didn   t seem that way. Of course, Anadarko itself is a tourism town. It  has had a strong tourism base over the years. So, a lot of the buyers     I   m not talking about the lookers   a lot of the buyers were from  somewhere else. We   ve sold paintings all across the United States and  even into Europe.  People who happened to be coming through town or had heard about  you?  Mostly they   d come through here. I don   t recall anybody just calling up  and saying,    I hear you have some Indian paintings, and I   d like to buy  one.    Again, we were a tourist draw here, and the gallery complemented  that.  My friend who   s Kiowa did not grow up here, just came back summers  to stay with her grandma in Anadarko, said that in like, the    60s and     70s, it was a thriving town. A number of movie theaters, lots going on.  Television changed a lot of things. (Laughter) We still have one movie  theater that shows one picture a night. (Laughter)  When you opened the gallery and you thought it would provide a service  to the town, complement the existing businesses that were here, what  was the focus of the gallery as you saw it? What media was it going to  focus on?  Well, we were principally Indian art, like I mentioned. We   ve only got,  right now, one non-Indian artist in the gallery, and he painted a  battleship, so it   s not relevant to the Indian art in any way. (Laughter) It  just kind of seemed to lend itself that way. Like I say, we had the 165  painting base to begin with. And I might add, most of those are gone.  Did you pick up sculptures right away, too?  10  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Sculptures kind of came along. There were some artists working on it.  Who were some of the artists that were sculpting?  Well, take Sherman Chaddlesone, for instance. Sherman did both,  paintings and sculpture. And a number of painters   Mirac Creepingbear  was the same way. He did both.  Parker Boyiddle, did you handle any of his works?  Had several of Parker   s works. Once we got it started, we kind of  became the first choice stop. Some of them would bring a work in that  wasn   t finished and want to sell it, want to draw some money against it.  But there   s a discipline that goes with that buying. You can only buy  completed works. The local people occasionally bring us things that we  put on consignment. Rarely ever buy their work. We agree on price, if it  sells. Most of them want to sell it right now. They   d like turn it back into  money, whatever reason they had. But, again, Anadarko has always been  a good sales point for Indian art. And crafts.  How much did you sell to other gallery owners or dealers?  They got the maximum discount, which is close to a wholesale price. It  went primarily to start up galleries. We   ve got some people   I have at  least one buyer who   s bought thousands of dollars    worth of art, that  he   s accumulated. He probably has more artwork than we have, yet  that   s not his field. He   s an engineer, but he   s always liked Indian art.  So, we see him frequently.  With the dealers, you   re not really making very much money, but you   re  helping them open another venue?  Even with our markup, we   re not overpriced. We price so that we can  discount. At the same time, we are competitive in the general  marketplace, very competitive. Part of it is because we   re close to the  source. And, again, we don   t extend out. We experimented with a few  shows and things, and it   s difficult because you just can   t display the  whole thing,  all the rest of the art you have . Very little results  from  that . I think  the galleries  attracted people to come to Anadarko, which  was the point of the whole thing to begin with.  So, in the early    80s, you had a couple of group shows?  Well, I don   t recall right off hand. We   d go to things that were   like  Oklahoma City, we   d go to a show, things put on by the tourism  department, the Oklahoma Arts Council.  11  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Did you go to Imogene Mugg   s Indian shows?  Not that I recall, no. Individual art shows, we didn   t go to those. And we  weren   t really finding people that were interested in Indian art, or that   s  the way it seemed. We haven   t done that in years.  You dealt with Doris Littrell. Doris and Bob McCabe. Do you remember  when you first met? Did you meet the two of them together?  Well, Doris is down the road, at Apache, southwest of here. So, we got  acquainted with her early on.  When she was in her early twenties or teens?  No, she   d been pretty well established in Oklahoma City when we  started doing business with her. We took her framing, we traded out. She  bought a lot of stuff from us, too. She   d come on a buying trip and     By herself or with Bob?  Both. It   s been a good relationship. Again, original art   s not competitive.  It   s strictly a matter of whether you like it, and is it priced to suit you.  One of the nice things about that for the artist is that the work is getting  out to other places It   s being seen by other people.  It   s kind of slowed down, but I think that there   s still a curiosity about it.  The world changes. Indians, per se, are not the same attraction they were  a few years ago. That circles around, comes and goes. The American  Indian Exposition   used to be we   d do a third of a year   s business in  that week of the American Indian Exposition. Now, Christmas,  graduation and things like that, they buy different things. We keep some  crafts and things here. A lot of times, that   s the only sales we have. We  don   t sell the artworks, we sell the crafts.  When Doris was coming to buy from you, who were some of the artists  that she would typically look for?  Mirac Creepingbear, in particular, that I can think of. We had a lot of  Mirac   s works.  What attracted you to his work?  He was close by. He had art to sell. He was a very prolific artist.  Unfortunately, his death, early death, was quite a shock to us. But he  12  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  was very prolific. And excellent work. We have a few things of his left,  but not many.  In your personal collection? Or here, in the gallery?  In the gallery. In fact, the main attraction in my home is a painting by  Mirac Creepingbear. It   s a large painting, about eight-by-ten feet.  (Laughs) Put a price on it of  12,000 dollars. (Laughs) Of course, it  can   t be replaced. There won   t be any more of those.  Did he used to explain images when he came in with something to sell?  He did. We try to put a name on every painting. Sometimes we ask the  artist to name it. It   s hard to not get into a pattern of,    Here   s another  one.     And Mirac, did he title his paintings beforehand?  A lot of them. A lot of them. And signed them. He was a very popular  artist, too. But, again, he worked at it.  Doris told me a story she had been told by another collector. She tried to  buy work from Rance Hood at different points, and spoke with him, but   according to the story , Rance sort of liked the excitement of haggling.  Well, I didn   t deal with Rance all that much because he really wasn   t  here anymore, whereas Larry was. Larry lived in Lawton. They   d come  up wanting to sell. Rance   my typical approach was,    Well, how much  do you want for it?    And if it was more than I wanted to pay, I   d said,     That   s too much. I   ll pay such and so.    (Laughter) And we worked  from there.  Did you ever get visited by  people  with paintings that were Dick  West   s or Blackbear Bosin   s or  Woogie  Wachetaker   s?  No.  Doc Tate Nevaquaya?  Oh, yes, we had Doc Tates. In fact, the Comanche Nation Museum  cleaned us out of Doc Tates. Bought them all at once, everything we  had. We   ve got Tim Nevaquaya here, Doc   s son. But all  Doc   s   paintings are gone. They took every one of them and put them in their  museum.  What was your relationship with Southern Plains Indian Museum? Did  13  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  they ever buy pieces from you or did they ask you to help with shows?  Well, I don   t know how I describe that. We got along real well. They  didn   t sell to us, we didn   t sell to them.  Did they ever borrow pieces for a retrospective?  Not that I remember. They had their own special group that went to  them first and us second, which didn   t keep us from buying or not  buying. There was not a problem. It was either for sale or it wasn   t.  However, their one big display room, which has several artists, we had  some of the same works by the same artists. They have a fine collection,  I might add. I don   t really know whether they   re for sale or not. I  haven   t seen them priced. So, they apparently bought them to display  them. (Laughter)  Sometimes people in the media have some power in terms of expressing  their opinions, and I   m wondering if you ever took an editorial stance on  Indian issues that maybe other non-Indian residents in the town might  have disagreed with?  Well, we   ve been kind of low-key on that. We are fully aware of the fact  that, well, for instance, the school system. I think the enrollment is 62  percent American Indian. It   s here. There   s no point in fussing about it.  Editorially, we   ve tried to be positive. We get negative, maybe,  occasionally.  You mentioned that Anadarko Indian Fair was a time when, in the    80s,  you did about a third of your business  for the year . Can you kind of  describe the atmosphere in the town and here at the gallery?  Well, yes, of course, that kind of comes and goes. Just the level of  national interest in American Indians was a factor in the whole thing.  The oil boom was on in Oklahoma in the    80s. It started in the late    70s,  and lasted until the early    90s. (Laughter) Made a difference. These  people around here, in this part of Oklahoma, they call it the Deep  Anadarko Basin. It stretches from here to Elk City, north into Custer  County, and up around and down Anadarko. It   s the deepest point. So,  that   s the reason for the name. Not that that   s relevant to this  conversation. (Laughter)  It was pretty free and easy there for a while. We, in our own case, had  one oil lease on five acres that paid three thousand dollars an acre. And  there was a lot of that. They had restricted drilling down to 15,000 feet.  So, since everything was deep here, it was very energetic. It started out  around Elk City and gravitated this way. But as the lease money rolled  14  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  in and the gas and oil rolled out, why, incomes of the people, locally,  went up, and they were buying Indian art. And the people that come here  to visit were buying Indian art.  So, you had a lot more local purchasers during that period?  Well, I say local    Oklahoma people, in particular. The whole state  benefitted. Some of them came to see the activity. At night, you could  see   I could count as many as six rigs running from my house. We were  on 640-acre spacing, so that gives you some idea.  When the oil  prices  fell, in the mid-   80s when the crunch came, a lot of  Indian art galleries in Tulsa and Oklahoma City really felt that. I  imagine it was the same for you?  Well, it just kind of tapered off. It just didn   t crash, but it just kind of  went away. We still have some activity here, but not like it was then. It  was crazy. There   s just no two ways about it. People would come in and  look at a piece of work and stand there and hold it. We finally had to put  up these signs,    Do not remove paintings. Ask for assistance.     (Laughter) It was really pretty good. That   s why we have Navajo  earrings and Hopi silverwork here, in addition to local arts and crafts  things. Of course, we were buying, too.  Did you go out to the Fair to buy occasionally, then?  No, they came in here. In other words, the buyers and the sellers, this  was a meeting place for them. So, I tried to stand between them all the  time. (Laughter) I did the buying and I did the selling, too. (Laughter)  Oil escalated prices somewhat,  but  we maintained the same markup.  We don   t just go through periodically and raise prices.  When artists brought their work in, in the past, if there was a lot of  cultural content, did you sort of take notes on that or mental notes? How  much a part of the business was that?  No, as I said earlier, there   s at least one painting that I can think of,  which I didn   t like it, but I bought it anyway. (Laughter) I didn   t pay a  real good price for it, and I didn   t get a good price for it when I sold it.  But it did sell. And I   ve always been surprised by that. So, I kind of  decided that I didn   t want to be putting my taste on the walls,  necessarily. Whatever came this way, if it was attractive, that   s the main  thing. A lot of the works that we have now are imaginative as opposed to  being realistic. In other words, the Five Kiowa Artists are all gone, and  they lived it. Today   s artists, they   re more contemporary to my mind  than are the Kiowa Five. So, they paint what they see. Sometimes, some  15  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  of their work is pretty weird. We try to stay away from weird, unless it   s  just priced to where you can   t refuse, just too good to be true. There   s  not much of that. We have a pretty good variety of work. Some of it   s  modern, some of it   s contemporary, some of it   s ancient. Some of them  you can look at and say,    Yes, I remember him,    and that sort of thing.  You do have a nice, diverse display.  Yes, in fact, I see these galleries   and I can remember some that I  visited over the years   where you   d have a large wall and the painting  would be on the wall there, and there wouldn   t be anything around it but  cushions and chairs, and  you   d have  to walk and look at it. Even the  Louvre Museum in Paris is not as cluttered as this place. (Laughter)  What did you pick up from going to galleries and trying to see how they  displayed art?  Well, particularly, west of here, we traveled some. And a lot of the  things we did were, we went to art galleries.  So, are you talking, like Santa Fe?  Yes, Santa Fe. We had a half-interest in a condominium in Tucson, so  we spent a lot of time out there. We went out of our way to look at them.  We took one thirteen-state trip one time. One of the big things we  looked at was art galleries.  What year was this?  Oh, I was afraid you were going to ask that. (Laughter) Let   s see, Carla  is forty-six, and she was three, so it has been forty-three years ago.  What ideas did you come back with?  I don   t think we came back with anything specific. That   s why I  mentioned this immense space given to galleries. Although, we have a  lot   I think it   s ten or eleven rooms here. It   s a lot, but it   s set up so one  or two people is all that is required to handle it.  I understand you had a fire in the newspaper office and at the gallery in  2009.  The gallery wasn   t involved in the fire, just the newspaper. And it was in  a separate building from this. Of course, currently, the operation is out of  this building. What happened was a bar, pawn shop, whatever was next  to the newspaper, mysteriously caught on fire. And we had a common  16  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  roof. Our building was a seventy-five-foot front   fifty feet was  occupied by the newspaper, and twenty-five by this bar. The fire went  over the wall and just burned us to the ground.  And you had artwork in there.  Yes, I had a lot of art, nice work, too. Most of it was large pieces. We  had a good room to display it in.  Were they premium pieces?  Well, mostly. That   s partly my wife   s doing. She liked everything we  had, except one painting, which was about a sixteen-by-twenty that I  liked. It burned up in the fire, too, as did  others  by well-known artists,  quality people. Good works that were in there   I don   t know how many  were there. We had one wall that had about five or six on it. Maybe  fifteen pieces.  That   s tough. Talk to me a little bit about this building that the gallery   s  housed in, what it was originally.  When we came down to Anadarko in    37, this was a Safeway building, a  Safeway store. What   s now a parking lot to the north of the building was  a drive-in on the corner. When Safeway built its own building and  moved out of it, why, the building owners, the Browns, converted the  property to the Anadarko Indian Agency, which handled the affairs of  seven tribes. We also have the Anadarko Area Office here, which is all  of Western Oklahoma and some of Kansas and Texas and New Mexico  and everything else.  I bought the building   first of all, I wanted the thirty-two off-street  parking spaces that came with the parking lot. I bought the building for  what seemed like an awful lot of money at the time, with the idea of  locating the newspaper in it. I just never did do it. The boom played  down. What else could we do? Well, we had this art gallery, which  wasn   t in this building at that time. It was at another property. One of the  things we could do was open up and expand our art gallery, so that   s  what we did. We kind of went on a buying spree.  To fill the walls a little more.  Yes. There was quite an interest at that time. Everything worked out  well. Unfortunately, deep drilling got to be terribly expensive. (Laughs)  The 640-acre space would kind of limit   that   s a square mile. So, you  only have one  well  to a square mile instead of four or six or eight. It  may come back, you never can tell. It just depends on whether we all  17  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  decide to run cars on natural gas. (Laughter)  What   s a memorable transaction for you that happened with another art  dealer?  Well, Doris did buy quite a few things from us. She didn   t buy it all at  once. She came down periodically. She   d shop through and see things  she liked. I   ve been up to her place     In Oklahoma City?  And seen some of our old pieces up there. She bought a lot of Mirac  Creepingbear   s work.  I know she was grateful to be able to buy that from you.  She has a nice gallery, I always thought. It   s well arranged, considering  location and everything else. She does a good business, too. Always has.  But she also has extended out. Of course, I understand   and I haven   t  visited with them in, say, a couple or three years   that she   s not as  active as she once was. Maybe I   m not as active as I was once.  (Laughter)  Well, she   s cut back to dealing just a couple artists. What about a  particularly memorable transaction with another artist?  Well, I don   t have any that come to mind where we would sell to another  artist.  I meant to say, an artist coming in and selling to you.  I   ve had them come in with as many as twenty paintings. I had one here  just a few weeks ago, and I picked out four, I think. You   ve seen a lot of  them. That was Tim Nevaquaya. I   ve got one of the paintings on the  wall there on consignment. I said,    I   ll just put that one for sale, too.    I  didn   t want to buy it. I don   t know whether   we haven   t sold any of  them, so     But that   s a nice grouping.  Well, that   s a periodic thing. A lot of the artists have other jobs these  days or they   re like me. I retired on the job, rather than from a job.  (Laughter)You can see from looking at the artworks that we do have a  pretty good collection from some of these people. But they didn   t come  in all at once. They came in over a period of time. You see a certain  similarity from paintings. We do have some people that come in and  18  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  look around, and I   m convinced that they   re trying to decide what to  paint.   Looking  for ideas, maybe?  That   s something I learned. I was on the Board of Directors for Indian  City U.S.A. for twenty-seven years. I wasn   t active, particularly, in the  operation part of it, but I was pretty well up to date on it. So, I learned  something about buying and selling Indian art. That was the other  source, and here. Although, we   ve got a lot more artwork than Indian  City has.  Can you explain a little bit about Indian City and what the board did?  Well, it was getting complicated. I was off the Board. I think Caroline   my wife  was on it at that time. She went on the Board about a year  after I left, I guess. The board was advisory. They had a hired manager.  He worked with the Board. The day-to-day operations were turned over  to him. We were there a lot, and I wrote about it in an editorial here the  other day, about  when  the Japanese Ambassador to the United States  came to visit Indian City. I was there and Dixon Palmer, the late Dixon  Palmer   he just died. He took the ambassador on a tour of Indian City.  When it was over with, the ambassador asked his assistant to come over  and inquire if tipping was permissible. He said,    Sure.    So, he gave  Dickson a pretty good-sized bill, at least for that time. I don   t remember  what it was, a twenty, I think. Could   ve been a fifty, I don   t know.  Anyway, Dickson smiled and kind of nodded his head, and waved at  him and says,    Aho     which in Kiowa means,    Thank you.    The two  Japanese put their heads together, and the assistant came over to Carl  West and inquired what did    Aho    mean? Carl told him,    It   s Kiowa for     thank you.       He says,    Oh, I   m much relieved.    Aho    in Japanese  means,    You fool.        (Laughter) One of those language things.  I   ve got to say that was my favorite memory of a good friend at Indian  City. I enjoyed it. I left because they decided to pull in their horns and  not expand, so it was a waste of my time.  That was quite a draw.  Well, it is. They continued on for several more years, and they sold it to  the Kiowa tribe, who tried it for a while and then shut it down. We had  somebody come by the office the other day, inquiring about what they  might do with Indian City. Well, they should have left it open. So, I  don   t know. I don   t know if people have lost interest. Indian City was  19  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  extremely unique when it was first founded in the early    50s. It was the  only thing like it in the whole United States. It   s been duplicated many  times over. In fact, an outfit in California even used the name until we  told them it was copyrighted, and they better quit, which they did.  They had live demonstrations, and they had replica dwellings.  Everybody kind of picked up on it. The seven villages, in itself, were  really unique, although the Wichita Grass House I   d seen before. I   d  never seen the others, other than a tipi camp. Of course, you didn   t have  buffalo hide. There   s a shortage of buffalo, even though Indian City had  a small herd. We used canvas instead of buffalo hides. In the wintertime,  tourism dropped off pretty rapidly, and we reduced the employment.  Most of the people who remained throughout the winter were  craftspeople. They made moccasins and knick-knacks and beadwork,  earrings. Things like that would be sold and they paid for themselves  that way. Plus, the fact that it sold for a pretty good price. Tricky  business.  People  say,    Well, this was made in Japan.    Well, yes, if you  had an original Indian artwork or piecework, it wouldn   t be that  inexpensive. So, you had to supply a unique market.  Looking back at the gallery business, what was one of the high points for  you?  Well, I   ve enjoyed it. I   ve been fortunate to have a mother/son group.  The mother died not long ago, Pat Ware, and Sam James III, or Trey  he   s called, took his mother   s place as the manager. I don   t know. I got  to thinking about that the other day,    What would I do if I had to operate  this myself?    I   d be bored to death, I   m afraid. (Laughter)  That   s kind of analogous to the way your family is carrying on, passing  down the newspaper business.  We   re in our third generation right now.  What was one of the low points of your gallery career?  I don   t really think I   ve had any, other than Pat   s death.  She had worked for you how long?  Oh, golly, fifteen years. Anyway, she had much of the same appreciation  of the works. Although, they left all the buying decisions to me, which  worked out well. It kept the pressure off them to buy things that they  maybe didn   t want. If I didn   t want it, I told them,    Thank you. I  appreciate you bringing it by. Maybe take it down to Susan Peters, and  20  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  see if they   re interested in it.     So, she kind of had the same eye as you did?  Well, she knew the people, and to some extent, spoke the language   a  good hand. Miss her.  I bet. What do you think it would take for Anadarko to again become a  center of Indian art activity?  First of all, there  needs to  be a resurgence in interest in Indian art,  clothing, all that sort of thing. That would help quite a little bit. It may  be a generational thing. There   s a generation that   s more interested in  Twitter than they are in earrings or paintings. (Laughter)  So, cultivating that new generation of buyers and artists?  Well, there has to be an interest. You know Americans, sometimes they  know too much about everything. (Laughter) We still have a lot of  foreign visitors here in the gallery. A lot of them come out of Fort Sill.  In other words, they   re at Fort Sill in Artillery School, and they   re in the  military. So, if you looked at our sign-in book, you   d see people from all  over everywhere.  Again, a lot of our sales are people that are not residents of Anadarko.  So, somebody says,    Where   d you get that?    and they say,    Oh, I got  that in Anadarko, Oklahoma.    We   ve had people say,    Yes, so and so  had a painting they bought here.    A friend or relative.    Interesting.  Is there anything you   d like to add about the gallery or art business or  anything we forgot to talk about?  Well, I haven   t lost interest in the gallery, but everything we   ve got is  for sale  (Laughter) I just rent the space. (Laughter)  Well, let   s take a look at a couple of pieces that you found especially  interesting.  I   ve always been interested in what we call Fire Dancers. I first saw it  live at the American Indian Exposition when I was very young. So, this  display is by Terry Allen Picard. He does a good job of the Apache Fire  Dancers. There   s Apaches and there   s Apaches. There   s the Fort Sill  Apache, and there   s the Mescalero Apache. Now, they   re related, but  there   s different kinds of Apaches. So, although they   re similar, each of  them is different. That   s one thing about Indian artists. I know that the  ones who come here and look to see what we have want to make sure  21  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  that whatever they   re doing is different. It may look the same, but it will  be different. The other guy   s head will be turned the other direction or  something like that, or the horse will be eating grass instead of just  standing there. But they don   t copy   or they try not to. So, that makes it  interesting. You rarely ever see paintings that    Now, these are rather  similar in appearance,  but  part of it   s the mounting and framing.  He   s got the dancers in different poses.  Yes, they   re doing different things. Once you   ve seen them live     normally, there will be at least five, sometimes just four, in a pattern  doing a dance, and it   s around a fire. That   s why they   re called Fire  Dancers.  Title?  I don   t recall. These are all just labeled Apache Fire Dancers. Dance of  the Mountain Gods, I think that   s what they call it in New Mexico.  How about this piece?  Well, it   s a print. We   ve sold all his originals we had. He   s Rance  Hood   s younger brother,  Larry Hood . Never was as popular an artist as  Rance or as prolific or expensive. (Laughs) These prints themselves are  still rather inexpensive, comparatively. We probably could have bought  a hundred of them for not much more than we paid for one. You do see  the variety. There   s a similarity, yet at the same time, they   re different.  So, even the artist competes with himself. Or herself. Although, it is  interesting, most of the artists are men. The beadwork, earrings, things  like that are more of the women.  Gesturing  These paintings in here are  a mixture between Huzo Paddlety and Jeffrey Yellowhair, who is still  with us and still painting. We have a whole room in there that   s Jeffrey   s  work. These two funny looking ones up here on the left-top are Nathan  Begay. He   s from out West. Navajo, probably.  You dealt with Jeffrey a long time?  Yes, we bought a lot of his work and sold a lot of his work. He paints  period pieces, more or less. Take this painting right here, it   s called  Yellowhair Power. Just trying to make a painting about some of the  Indian thoughts and beliefs and practices that are rather mysterious to  non-Indians. I wish that I had more, or room for more, as far as that  goes. We   re getting a little crowded in here.  He   s one of the painters that you really like?  22  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Little Thunder  McBride  Yes.  Now  Huzo Paddlety, he   s the one that did the mural on the north  wall. If you look at it, you recognize the similarity between what   s on  the wall and his paintings.  And you had him do that mural, when?  Ten years ago. He kind of tends toward pastel colors, what I call pastel  colors. They   re not the Indian works of, say, Jeffrey Yellowhair, which  are more true to life. His are attractive and marketable. There   s one right  there, above that buffalo painting, if you catch that. That   s kind of a  modernistic  piece . Maybe a little too far out. (Laughter) There   ll come  a day, though, that that can be considered conventional. (Laughs)  And as you mentioned before, you know that someone will come in who  will like it.  Yes, I can   t judge. What appeals to one may not appeal to me. (Laughs)  Which is fine with me. I   m pretty conventional in my taste in Indian art.  Well, I   ve really enjoyed talking with you and appreciate your time for  this interview.  Well, you   re welcome. Come again.  -------  -------
