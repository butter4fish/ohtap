Speaker 1: Okay now what we're gonna do is go into your early years, your family background and we'd like to start with your mother.  Can you tell us her name, please?
Speaker 2: Margaret Louise White Jackson [Margaret White Jackson].
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know.  I think she was born in southern Missouri too, probably in Cape Girardeau [Missouri].
Speaker 1: And did she grow up there?
Speaker 2: She spent a lot of her years there, yes.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her background growing up as a child?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  Her parents--her, her father [Lonnie White] worked on the railroad in, in southern Missouri.  And her mother [Lois White], my grandmother, was a domestic.  And I think they were all some combination of domestics back in those days.
Speaker 1: Did she share any stories with you that you can remember as a child about her childhood?  Did she share any special stories with you?
Speaker 2: You know, not a lot that I can remember but a few that, that I still recall about the, the work and the floods and the travails, the difficulty that her dad had as a railroad employee and as a musician, and as a manager of entertainment groups.  And the difficulty in maintaining housing because they lived in temporary housing all the time, seemingly for years.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother as a person?
Speaker 2: Extremely attractive, I mean movie star attractive, very bright, a memorable personality.  And the kind of person that people adopted and was attracted to throughout all the time that I knew her, with great energy and looked twenty years, thirty years younger than, than her age.  But great, great energy and great loyalty and lot of creativity.
Story_ID: 595784
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Now your father, what was his name?
Speaker 2: Emmett Leo Jackson [Emmett Jackson].
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in, in, Madison, Illinois.
Speaker 1: And did he grow up in Madison, Illinois also?
Speaker 2: He grew up in that area.
Speaker 1: How would you describe your father?
Speaker 2: Hardworking, very articulate, charismatic.  I won't say tough, but a survivor.
Speaker 1: Do you recall any stories that he shared with you about his background growing up?
Speaker 2: A number of them, you know, primarily the stories about his father [Sylvester Jackson] who was probably my, my single biggest mentor.  And about the times, landownership difficulties, and school integration difficulties.  And he led the, the--a group to integrate the schools in southern Illinois.  And how he was disenfranchised, he was literally stripped of his home and sent to--sent was told to leave the city, leave the area.  This time in Chicago [Illinois] trying to find his way there before they allowed him to come back.  So he recounts a lot of stories about his time in the [U.S.] Navy, how difficult that was and how tremendous contradiction it was to be on a foreign soil fighting for this country, and facing this, this constant of discrimination.
Speaker 1: What years would this have been for his, his move to, to integrate the school?  What year is?
Speaker 2: Fifty-two [1952] or '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: So he was part of that movement?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 595785
Speaker 1: So, you mentioned your grandparents.  Let's go back a little bit, let's start, start on your mother's [Margaret White Jackson] side.  Did you know your, your, your grandmother on mom's side?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Lois White.
Speaker 1: Tell me a bit about her?
Speaker 2: She was a, a tremendous little woman, she's probably five foot tall, and she had twelve children of her own.  And because my father [Emmett Jackson] was in the service, [U.S.] military, at the time I was coming along, I called her mom.  She was my mother through, through those years so we all lived in the same house--little boxcar we lived in.  And she cared for everybody, not just her immediate family, but everybody in the neighborhood [in Illmo, Missouri; Scott City, Missouri].  And she, well too, was very, very, very, very charismatic.  People depended on her and she was--she took care of everything up 'til the day she died at ninety-four, ninety-five.  She was taking care of business.  And she knew everybody and all the kids called her mom, and she was the community leader.
Speaker 1: How about your grandfather?
Speaker 2: He was a--he too was an interesting character.  He managed a--I wanna say, a negro baseball teams at that time, played a bit himself and was quite an athlete.  But he also had this natural knack for music, he was a musician too.  Played the piano. (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was his name?
Speaker 2: Lonnie, Lonnie White.  And Lonnie worked for the railroad company, was a straw boss on the railroad.  And he was the one that, that was kind of the center of our family in terms of a place to live and steady job, and overseeing all the family interests.  But he was a, a very, very strong, very forthright guy.  Had--two fisted drinker, two fisted fighter, two fisted lover.  He lived, he lived life to the end, right to the end.
Story_ID: 595786
Speaker 1: And on your father's [Emmett Jackson] side, can you tell me his mother's name?
Speaker 2: Marjorie [Marjorie LaPorte Jackson], and Marjorie died during childbirth.  I think her third son, definitely Roscoe [ph.].  She died during childbirth at age about thirty-four, thirty-five.  And I have photographs of her and she was a six footer, 6'1", 6'2".  And it looks like she weighed about 220, 230 [pounds], and was a very attractive woman.  Mixed, mixed--what do you call it, mixed race woman, and I had the impression my grand- it was my grandfather's love, love of his life.  That was, that was affair of the heart.  And to lose her in childbirth, don't think he quite recovered from it.  Because he lived to be eighty-something years old and I don't think he ever recovered from it.
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your grandfather, what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Sylvester, Sylvester Bias Jackson [Sylvester Jackson].  And he was, he was the real deal and he had a significant home and significant community status long before it was popular to have it.  And he was, he was an engineer by, by, by, by--naturally.  In fact, he worked with the engineers at the steel mill and--when they had to reset and recast machines, he was, he was a natural architect, natural engineer and designer.  And in his free time, he, he built homes.  So most of the homes in that area, that black folks had, he was the architect and the builder of those homes.  Most people can--when they had trouble with their homes, he'd go back and redo 'em.  And he knew all the homes in the area, including building his home, the highest one on the hill where you could overlook all the--most of the city.  And was a respected, tough little guy.
Speaker 1: In what city were these homes in?
Speaker 2: These were in Madison [Illinois], East St. Louis [Illinois], Alton [Illinois], Edwardsville, Illinois and Carbondale [Illinois], those areas.  And course he lived--we lived in Edwardsville at the time.
Speaker 1: And do you know if any of these standings are still standing now?
Speaker 2: They're all--most of them are still standing, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: What influence did he have on your life?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think he probably was my, my value leader.  He probably instilled most of the values I have through him.  The whole notion of work ethic and achievement, and teamwork and this whole drum major instinct that they talk about.  He was--he always was at the front of the line and assumed responsibility, and assumed leadership.  He was an aristocratic collared--blue collared person.  And I think I admired his, his style, I admired his energy and his leadership skills.  He--I think he would've been a great coach, he probably was the Knute Rockne of the neighborhood. You know, any family got down or loss something or had difficulty, they'd come by and see old man Bias Jackson.  And Bias had time and room for anybody who would come there to give them a pep talk or kick them in the butt, and tell them this is the way it should be done.  And he was, he was that kind of person.
Speaker 1: Now, during those times, we would, we would only assume that there was a lot of racism and segregation.  Did he ever share with you how he was able to overcome a lot of those things and still move forward?
Speaker 2: You know, not a lot.  I don't, I don't believe that in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] that we were as philosophical and as, and as, glib on this subject as we've become having watched, you know, Martin [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] and others taught us how to talk about it in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s].  But I think in observing him, he clearly lived two lives.  He had that life that got over with white folks and he had a life that got over with us, and he also knew both games.  He played both sides very well.  And he had mobility, he could move very, very well on either, either side of the track and he exploited that.
Speaker 1: Physically, was he able to pass?  Do you think he was able to pass on both sides?
Speaker 2: I think he could have but he never, he never wanted to.  Now, others on that side would have passed but no, he probably could have if they, if they wanted him to but he, he didn't play that game. He didn't want to.
Story_ID: 595787
Speaker 1: Now can you go back further to possibly their parents, like say, your great-grandparents?  Do you have any history on that at all?
Speaker 2: Only, only stories, only stories on the, on the Jackson side.  There's a county in Missouri called Callaway County, well, old man Callaway was a partner with, with my great-grandfather.  And they were horse breeders and horse traders.  And the story is they'd go back to Virginia and they would buy and sell horses along the path from St. Louis [Missouri] to, to Virginia, and they'd take their profits and as partners they would buy land, buy real estate.  And in Missouri at the time, in southern Illinois and that whole region, particularly Missouri, blacks couldn't own land.  But the two partners owned the land together.  Well, when old man Callaway died, the family apparently didn't honor the fact that he had a partner, and a black gentleman, Sylvester Jackson.  He never complained a lot about it but he'd always show the family this is my land; this is our property.  This is what I acquired.  And I never really--I believed it but I didn't understand owning land and what it, what it meant to the family at that time.  But he, he was very loyal to his partner, old man Callaway, and they were very, very--you know, they, apparently, they did well together.  But when he passed away, he had nothing to pass on to, to Sylvester and others.  So Sylvester was always a little bitter about that and was always determined to have his own property, his own land, his own contracts, and his own deeds and that kind of stuff.  And he got--that was a lesson he told.  Get your, get your real estate, get your land, have it on your own, don't trust anybody, don't trust the laws 'cause they'll change, the laws weren't made for you, and he would repeat that constantly.  You have to figure out a way to navigate through this system that wasn't built for you.  He told me that all the time.
Story_ID: 595788
Speaker 1: --That's great.  Well, I wanna move forward into your own life as a youngster, in your early years.  What is your earliest memory growing up that you have?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy.  Oh, yeah, my earliest one was, was probably at three or four years old, and the storms, the tornados that would sweep through, through southern Missouri.  That was annual thing, flooding and storms.  And the panic that my family would have.  Very calm, domestic people would suddenly just panic when the floods and storms would come in.  And we'd vacate the property every spring as the flood waters would--a (unclear) that'd come in or it'd rise to a certain level, and we'd come back in.  And what I remember at the tail of that was my Grandfather Jackson [Sylvester Jackson] coming down and saying no more of this, I'm getting my grandson out of here.  And everyone crying and hooting and all that.  And he finally after twelve or so--or all day it seemed like, he finally agreed to take everybody out.  And so the twelve kids and my grandfather Jacks- White [Lonnie White] and Grandma White [Lois White], and all the others loaded up the back of a pickup truck.  He took them all up to Edwardsville [Illinois].  It's about 150 miles north of that spot, put them all in his home and vowed that he'd put everybody in a house the next week or two and found homes for them I remember him doing all that.
Speaker 1: Is that, is that where you would go all the time during those years?  Would you go to his place in the springtime?  You said you went somewhere in the spring, where would you all go?
Speaker 2: We would go primarily down to southern Missouri.  Up to the homestead, try to re- relive that place.  I never quite understood it.  But I would spend my time with--I spent my first six years after I left the boxcar in Illmo, Missouri with my grandfather, lived with him.
Story_ID: 595789
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about your siblings and please list them in birth order, including yourself.
Speaker 2: Just had one, I had a sister.  Yeah, Marjorie Anne Jackson [Marjorie Jackson] and she's two years younger than me.  And she worked for forty years with the State of Illinois and retired just in the last six or seven years.  And has been living here in Arizona since and a real tribute to her--a real testimony of stick--doing something.  Leaving a small town of Edwardsville [Illinois] and going up to Chicago [Illinois] and living in a backroom with aunt and uncles and cousins and friends.  And put her stake in the ground in a very nice state job and very good retirement, she's done very well.  And when you consider being a woman back in those days and, and making a decision that her contribution would be in, in state work rather than the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] or in teaching, which she wanted to do at one time, she wanted to be in business.  And she got a job at the state and forty-something years later she, she retired.
Story_ID: 595790
Speaker 1: So you're about three, three years old or so when your grandfather [Sylvester Jackson] comes to get you and you move?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How many years did you stay in his homes, in his--
Speaker 2: I stayed two years in his home and by that time my dad [Emmett Jackson] got back from the, from the [U.S.] military.  And when he got back he started to build his own place.
Speaker 1: Tell me about life in that home during those few years, life with you and your sister [Marjorie Jackson].  What was family life like in that home with your grand- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My grandfather?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: We were actually split up.  My sister stayed with my mother's mom [Lois White] and dad [Lonnie White], and I stayed with my dad's, my dad, my dad's dad.
Speaker 1: So were you like an only child at that point?
Speaker 2: I would've been the only child then, yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the street that you were on at time or the name of the street that you with your grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 311 Olive Street [Edwardsville, Illinois].  Yeah, it's great, great street.  I can picture the--it was on a hill.  He--if you'd come around the corner, coming into the town and if you look up you can see the Jackson place up there.  And that's what he always wanted, his place to be the top of the hill.  But to get up there, you have to climb a steep hill, you know, Olive Street hill was a very steep hill.  And that was a place where we always did sleds in the winter and bicycling and that kind of stuff down that hill.  And he was very proud that he had the highest point on the hill and had--what do you call--there is a two and half story place he built there.  So he was really jacked up in the sky (laughter).
Speaker 1: Tell me about the neighborhood, the community around, around your home at that time?  Can you recall what it was like--any particular friends, anybody you might wanna mention?
Speaker 2: No, I, I tell you one thing.  It was called nigger hill.  And so everybody there was black and it was a center of, of everything that was important in that town in my opinion.  Because eventually all the musicians, all the intellects, all the athletes came out of--off that hill, off that area.  And it was the center of my life, and the families were all close.  I mean, there were only four or five families in the town and somehow another you were gonna marry a Brown [ph.], a Pendleton or a Jackson or someplace along the way.  And then we had another phenomena.  In about 1944, '43 [1943], '44 [1944] when labor had got really short and they had a, a radiator manufacturing company in town but labor shortages--they really trucked in labor from the South, Mississippi and Tennessee.  So they brought the labor in but they had no place for the folks to live.  So on the other end of the town they build a trailer camp, which was one of the worst things you can imagine, these trailer camps all sitting side by side.  But they were all there to do the work for the city.  And, as those people got traction, they got homes on the hill but--so it was a real mixture of domestic workers, the old time folks from the city and the immigrants that have come up from the South.  And the common meeting places where the church and of course the churches were divided real sharply with the Methodist church being those who had been there for a while, a long time and they typically had a little education and a little arrogance about them.  And then you have the southern trailer camp group, they went to the Baptist church and they were--those lines were really drawn tightly.  But the bars and schools began to erase that along with--the churches were the last to, to change but the bars and the schools tend to lure the two groups, so.
Story_ID: 595791
Speaker 1: Were there any other sights and sounds or smells that you can recall growing up around three or four years that you can recall that remind you of that neighborhood in that time?  Sights, sounds, smells.
Speaker 2: Now every time I--every summer when I smell barbeque in the neighborhood I think about--'cause we all did cook barbeque--outside barbequing all the time.  And great blues, blues center, blues and jazz were, were it.  And the reason for that several of the people who were raised in that area end up touring with bands like Duke Ellington, Count Basie.  And they'd come into St. Louis [Missouri], they'd always bring the band and the bandleaders into that--on the hill.  And so it was always a big celebration and a big party when Duke Ellington would come to town, or Count Basie or Albert King, or [HistoryMaker] B. B. King would come in or something like that.
Speaker 1: Are there any other names of people that lived in that area who were known as great musicians or artists later on?  Was there anybody you can think of in particular?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the biggest one I knew was a fellow named Forrest, Jimmy Forrest, who was a saxophone player, really a great one.  And later or just a while, what's his name, the great alto sax guys moved there for a while.  And they, they were--had great influence on the area.  Then Albert King had a place there at one time, and B. B. would come in and you'd see them around, around the area. But that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Jimmy Forrest of 'Night Train' fame, that Jimmy Forrest?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Back, that's back, yeah.  He was quite a, quite a musician.
Story_ID: 595792
Speaker 1: So you haven't quite entered school yet, you're just three or four years old and you said your father [Emmett Jackson] coming back from, from which branch of service did he come?
Speaker 2: He was in the [U.S.] Navy, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So he would have entered when you were a very small baby or?
Speaker 2: He probably entered just at the time I was born.  If I recall, when he, he came back just a month or two after I was born so he probably went in, in '39 [1939], '38 [1938], '39 [1939].  And then the war [World War II, WWII] broke out and he was shipped to the Pacific region someplace out there.
Speaker 1: So you really didn't--had, had no interaction with your father?
Speaker 2: Not 'til, not 'til 1946 or '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: When he came back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was probably seven or eight years old by--before I knew him as a father.
Speaker 1: So he comes back and you by this time, you're not in school yet, so you're getting ready to enter elementary school.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: When he comes back, you all move to where now at this point?
Speaker 2: This little town of Edwardsville [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, so he comes back from the service and you and your sister [Marjorie Jackson] are reunited again, and you move back into the same?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he starts immediately to build a home.  And he did what most folks did back in those days, he built a basement.  Found the property and built a basement.  And that basement was the start of--the house was gonna go on top and three years, four years later or five years later, the big house got completed.  My grandfather [Sylvester Jackson] collaborated with him and they built the big house.
Speaker 1: So you say they built it with--are you talking about actual hands on labor?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  They were the labor.  They brought the, they bought the parts, you know, on, on credit and there was no banking relationships in those days.  You just went to the lumberyard and signed a note and my grandfather co-signed all that stuff for it.  And so he bought the--bought the nails and blocks, and all that stuff and they--neighbors would come and they built, they built a house.
Speaker 1: So this neighborhood in Edwardsville, can you recall it at all?
Speaker 2: Oh, I see it all the time.  I'm gonna see it next week.
Speaker 1: Tell me the street name?
Speaker 2: This is, this is St. Louis Street.  It's right across from the, the public high school.  And it's a, it's a beautiful street.  I mean, now it is.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the community around that area, the neighbors?
Speaker 2: Neighbors were mixed right where my dad's place was and I don't know if that's north or south.  All black and then turn right, it was all white.  So it was kind of like a line and each, each year it's like another house would be sold and we got black would move into it.  It was mostly white when we moved there and then gradually more and more blacks took homes, took homes further out.  These are homes.
Speaker 1: You're a little older now, you're maybe six, seven years old.
Speaker 2: I'm probably seven years old, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're a bit more aware of things at this point.  You being the only black family to move in, and how was the reception, do you recall any stories or comments between your parents?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't that aware.  You know, I wasn't aware.  Interesting you'd say you're more aware, I was aware of, of those things that were in my--on my radar screen.  Discrimination, the rules of where you go and where you don't go, those were constants.  And you, you're psychic just didn't get beyond my psychic in those areas.
Speaker 1: So how were those, how were those rules imparted to you?  Did your father and mother [Margaret White Jackson] tell you these rules?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yeah, you just knew.
Speaker 1: What were some of those rules?
Speaker 2: Just say you in the wrong place, you can't go there.  White folks live there.  And I can remember the home that, that a family just--I think it was north of us, just north of us had.  It was a Frank Lloyd Wright kind of design, and I can remember staring at that place and that's the house I want.  I mean, that is, that is a home.  And the family that lived there, I used to see the kids.  They were about my age, and I used to go to the corner and stare and look at them and look at that house but I knew that I was up on St. Louis Street and, you know, it was kind of like cross the divide.  You could ride through there but you couldn't stop.  And, if you walked there, you had to be with a--somebody that was doing the domestic work there.  I don't remember anyone sitting down telling me the rules though.  You just kind of knew it.  I remember that home was always something I said I want that place, you know, that's the kind of house I want.
Story_ID: 595793
Speaker 1: So you, you're going to go into elementary school, do you recall your first school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Lincoln.  In fact, later on I'll tell you a great story about Lincoln School [Edwardsville, Illinois].  But Lincoln School was the only school where first through twelfth grade blacks attended, and it was maybe a five room building.  I know the square footage because I'm buying that building now, twenty-nine thousand square feet.  And my dad's--my grandfather's [Sylvester Jackson] second wife, Alma H. Jackson [Alma Jackson], was the teacher of four or five grades in that, that school.
Speaker 1: And was she your teacher?
Speaker 2: She was my teacher.
Speaker 1: For how many years would you say?
Speaker 2: She taught first, second and third, and fourth grade in one room.  And I was with her through the fourth grade.
Speaker 1: Was she a big influence educationally on you when you started school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my grandfather was, was a bigger influence though.  He was a no nonsense attitude about education and about compliance, and, and submission.  And, with her being there the teacher, she was kind of the town superstar.  That just made it more of folks had a responsibility because of her and because of my grandfather, do the right thing.
Speaker 1: So I guess it was kind of different having your own grandmother so to speak as your teacher.
Speaker 2: I was just--it was very different.  I mean, you didn't mess up because my grandfather was all over it, you know.
Speaker 1: So you didn't feel privileged, you felt more, more responsibility.
Speaker 2: I felt great responsibility to get it right, yeah.
Speaker 1: And who were some of your classmates?  Anybody that you can mention for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah, one fellow that I went through that level and through high school [Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois] and college [University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], and still friends, Govoner Vaughn, known him for years.  And we end up playing high school and college basketball together and professional basketball together.  And the Pendleton family, the Bradford [ph.] family, the whole Scott [ph.] family.  Yeah, I remember all.
Story_ID: 595794
Speaker 1: So you're at this school, Lincoln School [Edwardsville, Illinois], now what's special about Lincoln School, Mr. Jackson [HistoryMaker Mannie Jackson]?
Speaker 2: Well, the property where the school set, the original building was a meeting center for governors and politicians.  That was the county seat of Madison County [Illinois], which was one of the more influential southern Illinois counties in, in Illinois.  And it was a popular place where Abe Lincoln [President Abraham Lincoln] used to--would come through there and spend time and so there're lot of stories about his time there and a lot of memorabilia that was left behind.  That whole building was--got incorporated into Lincoln School.  Well, as you can imagine, it wasn't valued at the time because it was just that phase.  But as years went past and historical perspective began to be placed on, on Lincoln more of the memorabilia disappeared from there and the school was relegated to be the place where, where blacks would go.  And more recently it's been designated a historical, you know, site and part of (unclear) I, I bought, bought the building.  I bought that whole block, that whole area there.  And I'd, I'd like to restore all of that because that was a place where I attended school.  It was a fairly significant place but not thought so at the time.  But in--like a lot of things in a historical perspective, it was quite an honor to have attended a place where someone of that, that background had gone to.

Speaker 1: What kind of student were you?
Speaker 2: Good, yeah, good.  I had to be good.
Speaker 1: You had no choice.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was--I tell my daughters [Cassandra Jackson and Candace Jackson] now I hope I'm not doing what my parents [Margaret White Jackson and Emmett Jackson] did to me.  Be natural, work at it, but I had to be good.  My grandfather [Sylvester Jackson] was a stickler for it, he had a, a little bit of a thing going because he was a working man--a working man's working man who married an educated school teacher [Jackson's step grandmother, Alma Jackson].  And, he didn't want her to ever come home and say something is going on with the Jackson kids.  And then my dad was a tremendous achiever.  When he got back his whole thing was you gotta avoid what I'm going through, what I had to go through.  Get education, get, get started.  So a lot of pressure to be educated, to do well in school.
Story_ID: 595796
Speaker 1: So, as you're in school [Lincoln School, Edwardsville, Illinois] and you, you have a friend, Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] was your friend, your own grandmother [Jackson's step grandmother, Alma Jackson] was your teacher, and so you stay there at that school for twelve years?
Speaker 2: No, no.  That's a good question, the schools integrated between the seventh and eighth grade.  And they came with a plan to phase the integration.  And it was, I think it was a flawed plan because they wanted to, to integrate the high school first, which I'll never understand the wisdom of doing that, but they wanted to 'cause there were fewer students.  The high school was integrated first so that, that integrated in 1952 when I was in like the sixth grade.  And we watched that integration process take place, so.
Speaker 1: Fifty-two [1952] is prior to Brown vs. Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].
Speaker 2: Just on the cusp of it, just, just on the edge of it.
Speaker 1: So in your time they were a bit forward on that?
Speaker 2: Well, I think they had been directed by the state to, to move faster.  And in the central part of the state and the northern part of the state, they moved a bit faster than down in southern Illinois.
Speaker 1: Now, how old would you have been approximately?
Speaker 2: Probably eleven or twelve.
Story_ID: 595797
Speaker 1: Now, in your neighborhood or outside of that whole community I'm sure there was commerce you had to do, places you had to go and do things, do you recall any problems or tensions once you got outside of your neighborhood and went into other areas of town?  Was it segregated?
Speaker 2: Oh, completely. Completely (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Are there any incidents or things you can recall that made you think?
Speaker 2: Completely.  You know, we used to go to a place called Sparta, Illinois, which was a summer retreat for, for black folks, and it was great, you know, had a outside pool and little cabins we stayed in, and music and stuff like that.  But I can remember my dad [Emmett Jackson] saying when we'd go there he said to get it all right now, go to the bathroom early 'cause he wouldn't be stopping going in.  (Laughter) You not gonna stop at any--get your, get gased up, we're gonna to Sparta.  And things were always a joke, we'd always get big kicks out of it.  But even as we moved into playing junior high school basketball and stuff, and we'd get in the back of cars to go to another town to play, the white players could go in and get something to eat.  The three black players would wait in the car 'til they came back, they'd bring us some- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Even though you were basically children?
Speaker 2: Just eleven and twelve years old.  We won the state championship, the second state champions when I was a senior in high school [Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois] and they had a big celebration in my hometown, parade and everything.  And Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] and I set in the back of the, of the restaurant while the party and the parade went on, they served us in the kitchen.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And we were the stars of the team.
Story_ID: 595798
Speaker 1: Let's back up a moment.  So you're in ele- did, did your sports aspirations start in, in, in the elementary school years [at Lincoln School, Edwardsville, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: It started--yes, it did.  It started--my--the young men I looked up to were athletes. Musicians and athletes.
Speaker 1: Who were some of these athletic people that you were looking up to at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think the local stars there are the people you know about locally.  You know, of course Jackie Robinson story you heard about and Joe Louis you had heard about.  And I, I don't remember clearly but I remember being--remember having some feeling about how much attention people like Joe Louis got.  And how my mom [Margaret White Jackson] and dad [Emmett Jackson] and all the neighbors would flock around the radio or, or go to down the street to watch a TV through an outside window at this guy.  And that--sports meant something.  And I--one of the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters] for example played the Lakers [Minneapolis Lakers; Los Angeles Lakers] in Chicago [Illinois]. And I remember my uncle making a big thing about it, you know, that how good they were and guys he knew and, and then hearing about Jackie Robinson it kind of--the sports culture begin to, to have a impact, impact on me.  And, by the way, not the least of the impact was the fact there was immediate acceptance.  If you're a musician or, or a black athlete, you have access to things that no one else have access to.  I don't care what you did in algebra or what you did in any other course, nothing gave you access at that time like music and athletics.
Speaker 1: So were your parents aware of your ability as a child in those early years?  Did anybody see, see that you had some special abilities or at least a, a skill (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I think my mom knew before my dad knew, because my mom had five or six brothers and those brothers were good athletes.  And they would come to my mom and say, "He's, he's gonna be--he's good, he's got, he's got good young legs, good young stuff."  And she'd always say, "Don't get carried away with that."  You know, "School first you know your dad doesn't want you doing this."  And then later my dad caught on to it.
Speaker 1: So in elementary school usually it's a little--it's not as structured, they're smaller little leagues and things but your actual compe- competitive reaction started when, in the junior high years?
Speaker 2: I'd say in the sixth and seventh grade.
Story_ID: 595799
Speaker 1: Now what was this new school?  What was the name of this new school?
Speaker 2: The new junior high school I went to?  I don't remember the name on the tip of my tongue now but it was totally integrated and they took, they took twelve of us into the school and the other twenty or so got left behind.
Speaker 1: What was that like for you going into this new integrated school?
Speaker 2: Well, some of the kids we knew because we had, we had--my folks had done domestic work with them.  And then in the summers, we'd, we'd play ball and hang out with some of the, you know, some of the names we knew so it wasn't a complete shock.  What was the biggest shock was the classrooms.  How--they weren't any better structured than the Lincoln School [Edwardsville, Illinois] classrooms, but how much equipment they had and how much space they had.  And when we first walked in the classroom, we realized how much further along they were in terms of learning than we had gotten to.  Many things they were dealing with in the sixth grade we had, hadn't heard of, hadn't seen, and we were behind.  And, again, the story I tell is that to the good graces of two teachers, Miss Edwards [ph.] and Miss Mumma, Barbara Mumma [ph.], they actually worked with Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] on the weekends.  And at nights they'd bring us in and spend time with us, and accelerated us to get caught up.  But we were way behind.
Speaker 1: Now, now were these African American teachers or?
Speaker 2: These are white teachers.
Speaker 1: And they took time on the weekend to tutor you?
Speaker 2: On the evenings and weekends they'd, they'd invite us over for dinner, invite us over for whatever--to watch television at that time it was the screens but the whole idea was to--they'd spend time teaching.  And their idea was to get us caught up.
Speaker 1: So you consider them a major influence (unclear)?
Speaker 2: I mean, you can't imagine how embarrassing it was to go in the classroom and not have any of the skills.  They were in different books, they were at different level than we were at, and the intensity was a lot different.  Because we were in a crowed--we had first through fourth grade with all backgrounds and all things going on, and one teacher trying to get through the day.  And it was nothing like it was in those classrooms, and we were way behind.  We were smart, we felt smart but we were street smart and they were making us look silly.  So it took about a semester where we were starting to get caught up and by the time we graduated from junior high school, I'd say Govoner and I really had accelerated past a lot of people.  And, of course, sports got to be a big deal too.
Speaker 1: Besides those two teachers, was there anybody else that was influential during this time period in your life in the school or in the community?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'd say yeah, there were, there were some black folks that, that really stood up that--and this was street stuff.  I mean, they'd come to the parks and at recess and stuff and say, "Nobody's gonna mess with these kids."  There were--I mean, Wes McMurry [ph.] was, was there he'd save you.  You don't, you don't mess with Mannie [HistoryMaker Mannie Jackson] and Gov, just don't put your hands on them.  Uncle Lonnie White, he'd be there when school was out, be there when school started.  I don't know how he worked, but you don't mess with them, you'll be in trouble there.  And he'd tell the parents that and he'd tell the kids that.  So that made life really nice for us 'cause we had no issues, no issues at all and people were just absolutely great all the way through.  And the reason I think they were so good, because all these kids that were in school would, for the most part, my mom [Margaret White Jackson] and dad [Emmett Jackson], and Gov's folks had all worked for them at some time or another.  So we weren't a threat to them and we kind of knew how to play the game.  And being good athletes and good musicians too also began to, to influence how they felt about us.
Story_ID: 595800
Speaker 1: How were the sports for you in--when, at what time in junior high did the sports thing really kick in for you and Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Immediately, immediately.  In fact, we'd pass up in the classroom, couldn't wait for recess and go dominate them either in softball or on the basketball court.  And walk in with the kind of arrogance you shouldn't have and--so immediately.
Speaker 1: Do you recall the coach, your first coach in junior high?
Speaker 2: Yeah, name's Gregory [ph.].
Speaker 1: Mr. Gregory?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what did he think about you and Govoner's experiences or your skills?
Speaker 2: I don't think he had seen anything quite like that in kids our age.  I don't think he--I think--but I think he was, he was a good guy the sports, sportsman.  And I think he tried, and he built a team around the two of us.  And we won every game we played by some big numbers and stopped playing our games in the junior high school, we played with the high school [Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois] we were drawing so many people.  And I think he just loved the attention he was getting and didn't quite understand, you know, eleven, twelve year olds doing what we were doing.  And end up being a good person.
Speaker 1: Was anybody else there who was very athletic besides you and Govoner, who went on to do big things in any other professional world?
Speaker 2: Not--no, not, not, not for a long time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What about Don Ohi [sic. Don Ohl]?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Ohi, Don Ohi?
Speaker 2: Donald, Donald was like two years ahead of us so Don was coming up through the other side of town, through the white junior high schools and by--and we were--this is interesting because we played the high school team, when we were in the eighth grade.  And Donald was a starter on that team and Donald was the kind of guy that didn't give a crap about racism, just didn't care, just didn't have that on his agenda at all.  So he became an ally right away, he said, I want these guys to get out of junior high school and get to high school real fast so we can start winning games.  So he became a really close friend and ally.
Speaker 1: So you are now--you and Govoner are we'll say in sixth, seventh grade or seventh and eighth?
Speaker 2: Eighth grade, yeah.
Speaker 1: You all are stars, you're playing the high school teams?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which is an unheard of precedent?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And your junior high school is going on to win championships now?
Speaker 2: We didn't lose a game.  I think we were at 24 and 0 or something like that.  We didn't, we didn't lose.
Speaker 1: How many, how many championships did you win with them?
Speaker 2: Every tournament we played in we won, probably two or three.
Story_ID: 595801
Speaker 1: So now it's time for you to go to--you and Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] to go to high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What high school did you got to?
Speaker 2: Edwardsville High School [Edwardsville, Illinois].
Speaker 1: And was that also integrated at that time?
Speaker 2: That was in its third year of integration, yes.
Speaker 1: So now we're past, we're past Brown vs. Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954], we're past the Little Rock experience and now you're--what year would you say this is?
Speaker 2: Would've been in 1953 I think.
Speaker 1: Oh, '53 [1953] so, so this is actually before all of, this is actually before all of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Fifty-two [1952], '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: This is actually before all of that.  Okay, I stand correction. So, so it hasn't even happened yet.  So you're in high school and you all are coming back with a track record.  Now you, you have a track record of, of being these stars from junior high.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're going in to high school now.  They're waiting on you so to speak?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Yeah.  And I keep adding both academically and, and sports wise.  We, we, we were accomplished by the time we got to high school.
Speaker 1: So, you and Govoner were not just thinking sports, sports, sports, your grades also were very reflective of hard work also?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we really made some progress in that one year with the help of Miss Edwards [ph.] and Miss Mumma [Barbara Mumma (ph.)].  We made great progress.
Speaker 1: So as you go into high school, you're, you are prepared you say for your--for everything that's gonna face you now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your high school experience when you got--when you get there for the ninth grade that would be?
Speaker 2: It was ninth grade.  It was, it was segregated, but we were just young boys, just guys that tell us what to do and we'd do it.  And, when it came to sports and music and classrooms, most people got out of the way.
Speaker 1: Who was your first high school coach?
Speaker 2: Joe Lucco probably would be the first, first person that really coached us.
Speaker 1: Joe Lucco?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what was his reaction when you got, there did he have any special influential things to tell you or any special greetings when you got there?
Speaker 2: We gotta win all the championships we can, number one.  He's was a great--he was another one of these people that just did not see color, just did not tolerate anything but just getting, getting it done.  And he kind of adopted the two of us and became a big influence in both of our lives particularly mine.  And I'd say through the time he passed away four or five years ago, he was probably my number one fan.
Speaker 1: What was your success rate like basketball wise in high school?
Speaker 2: We probably won 85, 90 percent of the games we played.
Speaker 1: Any championships for the state?
Speaker 2: Went to the state tournament twice, you know, it's kind of unprecedented to do that. We got second that--my senior year and won all the sectional and, you know, local tournaments around southern Illinois.  Ranked first and second in state, you know, two or three years.
Story_ID: 595802
Speaker 1: So would you call yourself a celebrity, somewhat a local hero or celebrity at this point of your, of your life?
Speaker 2: In that town, absolutely, yeah.  That's all those little stupid southern Illinois towns deal with is sports.  It's all they had to do on Saturday, (laughter) Saturday night, Friday and Saturday nights.
Speaker 1: What was your social life like during that time period in high school [Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Sports, hiding from white folks, trying to find places you can hide from on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Did your family attend church, were they very religious during this time period?
Speaker 2: My, my aunts and uncles were; my mother [Margaret White Jackson] and father [Emmett Jackson] were not.  They were religious but not church attendees.
Speaker 1: So, did you have any other activities besides sports, extracurricular things or clubs, or anything you were--I heard you mention music, were you involved in
Speaker 2: Yeah, I played an instrument and played in the band, yeah.
Speaker 1: And which one did you play?
Speaker 2: I played a saxophone.  And the guy I was trying to think, think about who I'd got an early lesson from is Illinois Jacquet.  If you remember that name back, back in the
Speaker 1: Illinois Jacquet, yeah.  So you actually saw these guys?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you had, you had a, a--we'll call you a modern day Renaissance man because your grades were good, you were playing sports and you also had arts aspirations also.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact I probably would've gone toward music rather than sports except my dad just discouraged it so much.
Speaker 1: Why did he discourage music?
Speaker 2: He just assumed that it was a bad path to be on.  Nightclub life, late nights, and lot of drug influence, and he was always downplaying the sport--the entertainment thing.  When I say always, he just--it was that kind of a negative thing with him.  He didn't encourage it at all.
Speaker 1: Did your friend Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] play an instrument also?
Speaker 2: No, no he did not.
Speaker 1: He was more sports oriented.
Speaker 2: Sports and very good academically.  Very good, and from a very large family and they were working folks.
Story_ID: 595803
Speaker 1: Now, I've done some research.  In six- in '54 [1954] which is a big year in history, you were winning the basketball championships, tell me about that year?
Speaker 2: Fifty-four [1954] we played in the finals of the state championship and I was--the significance of that for me is I was a sophomore.  I think I was like thirteen, fourteen years old.  And I was the first thirteen or fourteen year old--think it was thirteen to lead the state in scoring in, in the Illinois state tournaments and all.  And the team we played against, if you--it was DuSable [DuSable High School], the big team out of Chicago [Illinois] and that was really fun, an all-black team that we played against.  And that was--and people were divided, black folks, 'cause they wanted to root for DuSable and had followed us through all the stuff we'd overcome.  And I think it was a great, great drama, great theater to see DuSable playing Edwardsville High [Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) History tells us that there was some maybe impropriety on the refs' [referee] side of that particular game.  Can you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I tell you DuSable had a tough time.  The game they lost to Mount Vernon [Mount Vernon Township High School, Mount Vernon, Illinois] was clearly a takeaway.  They did not want DuSable to win the state championship, and they did not want DuSable to beat even our team that had two blacks on it.  They didn't want DuSable to beat, to beat the team to the state tournament.
Speaker 1: So what did they do, call different things?
Speaker 2: Yeah, some bad calls, man.  And a lot of, lot of trash talking on the floor, referees to the players.
Speaker 1: What was your worst moment of your career in high school athletically?
Speaker 2: I didn't have any worst moment, I didn't have any worst moments (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I mean, the game that you really wanted to win that really caused
Speaker 2: I'd say losing the state championship.  I think we were, we were the best team by far in the state.  Yeah, and I think we just, that just chance, I think that was a probably a bad moment.
Speaker 1: Was it a close game?
Speaker 2: Very close, one point.  And that would've been historic to a small school like ours to overcome all that we overcome and--but just one of those things.
Story_ID: 595804
Speaker 1: So it's soon time for you to go to college.  Was that, was that the next step or did you have other plans?
Speaker 2: Well, I had choices.  And there's a whole part of my life now that I mention my life would--hard to talk about it.  As I worked at a country club and I was a bartender.
Speaker 1: During high school [Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: During high school, yeah, from junior high school and high school.  And I started out shining shoes and worked up to, you know, what do you call, the busboy.  And end up being the, the lead bartender in the clubhouse and making good money.  And I was playing basketball, and the pro out there offered me a, a huge amount of money to stay on and continue to tend bar and not go to college.  And made a great case for it.  He said, "You know what, you're making money, and people like you here, and you're fifteen, sixteen years old and you got a new car sitting out there.  And I'll pay you more and you make more than my wife does, she teaches school."  And I really had to decide.  And, 'course my dad [Emmett Jackson] and folks would have no part of it.  But the big choice we have is where we go to school and of course the influence was to stay in Illinois because so many people knew of us and knew what we had done.  But at that time other schools from the East Coast and out west here had been calling.  And we made the rounds of all the schools, I probably went to fifty schools, fifty places to visit and had decided on two or three finalists.  And at the end of the day we made the choice to go to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], which end up being the best decision we could have possibly made.
Speaker 1: And what was the reason behind that choice?
Speaker 2: I think with our backgrounds, kind of rural, kind of countrified, not nearly as slick as we thought we were, we needed to be close to our families and in that town.  I also think that, that school was probably more nurturing than say, Seton Hall [Seton Hall University, South Orange, New Jersey] or St. John [St. John's University, Queens, New York], or UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] would have been.  I think we would've gotten lost in some of those places, caught up in things.  And I think the, the people at Illinois had expectations and had the kind of infrastructure that allowed us just to focus on what we were.  We're kids going through college, get through school, get an education, play basketball.  And that's what happened, nothing else got in the way.
Story_ID: 595805
Speaker 1: So at the country club you had a established job there so to speak.  Were you also like a known kind of celebrity among the patrons there because they knew who you were (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, yeah.  That's all they did was follow sports.  They, they knew it, they knew how many points you scored and--
Speaker 1: So here is a high school superstar.
Speaker 2: Tending the bar.
Speaker 1: And, and he's there bartending.  And were your tips better because of that?
Speaker 2: Tips were great; tips were absolutely great.  The life was good; the life was really good.  I tell you, I worked hard.  My dad [Emmett Jackson] had been sent outta town and he went to Chicago [Illinois], so my mom [Margaret White Jackson] had moved to, to, to Madison [Illinois] and we lived in projects down there.  And we'd commute back up to Edwardsville [Illinois] to go to school.  So my mom was really on short money and I, I'd add fresh cash every day.  I'd put money on the table for her and the good time.
Story_ID: 595806
Speaker 1: So you decided to go to University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]. How old would you say you were at this point?
Speaker 2: Probably sixteen.  I made a decision, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, had you declared--now, besides sports, you knew--at this point, were you really thinking okay, I'm gonna be a professional athlete?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: So, so do you have a major, a major in college that you were gonna major in?  Did you have a direction?
Speaker 2: I knew I wanted to--I've always known I wanted to be in business.  And a lot of guys wanted to be in coaching and social workers, and stuff.  I always wanted to get in on the business side.  I think I got that from my [paternal] grandfather [Sylvester Jackson] and also just being around so many businesspeople at the, at the country club and listening to them talk about the stock market and about business and about buying and selling things.  And I, I thought their lifestyle resonated with me better than anything else I'd seen.
Speaker 1: So would you say that exposure has a lot to do with, with, with direction?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, I, you know, I have no problems my mother [Margaret White Jackson] being a domestic because that exposure, their homes and their reading material and their lifestyle had a great influence on me.  'Cause had no role models like that in the part of town we lived at.  Had I not gotten off Olive Street and off, you know, Schwarz Street [Edwardsville, Illinois], little towns we were--streets we were living on, I would not have seen a lifestyle like that up close.  And roamed through these people's homes and look at how they were living.  If I hadn't been at the country club, I wouldn't have been able to sit at the bar and listen to these guys talk about, about transactions.  And feeling it.  It was like a chapter in book, I'd see them one week and they'd say, "The bank is going out to New York [New York] to do this," and "Damn, it didn't happen.  We gotta go back again."  I'd listen to them go back and forth and I got really interested in that stuff.  I said, that's where I should be over there on that side.
Story_ID: 595807
Speaker 1: So you go to University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], you and Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] both decide to go?
Speaker 2: Both decide to go.
Speaker 1: Tell me about your experiences reaching campus there?
Speaker 2: It was good, I mean, you know, I guess the perspective on it now is it was good.  They took care of everything and we were welcomed when we went there.  The media was really good to us and the basketball experience was excellent.
Speaker 1: When you get there now, are you the first African American players at this school?
Speaker 2: We were the first to, to play varsity basketball at the University of Illinois.  And, when I say it's good, it was racist, and a pain in the ass, and probably something no one would tolerate today.  But it was good because it wasn't a lot different than the rules we had at southern Illinois.
Speaker 1: That was Champaign, Illinois, right?
Speaker 2: In Champaign, Illinois, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell us about life in Champaign?
Speaker 2: Oh, the rules were, you know, you had to walk stay on your side of the street, you had--we lived in the dorms which were integrated, which was nice.  But the public accommodations, you know, couple of places you could go to and you had places where you'd sit.  At theaters you had a certain side of the theater you'd sit in.  There's no barbershops available to you, couldn't get anything done in those days.  And certain restaurants weren't available to you.  But they were the same rules we had down in southern Illinois, so in that way it wasn't that bad.  But we had people in academia seemed to be trying and unlike Edwardsville [Illinois] where it was kind of like the way it was at farm area down rural area.  In Champaign, people talked about it, they seemed to really care.  And we found ourselves talking about conditions more than, than anyone ever talked about it in, you know, before in our lives.
Story_ID: 595808
Speaker 1: Tell me about the night when you played Kentucky [University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: That was a, that was a good one.  I mean, that was a, that was a night I'll never forget.  We played Kentucky not in Lexington [Kentucky] but we played them 'cause Rupp [Adolph Rupp] didn't wanna play us in Lexington.  Vows never to have a black player play in that gym there.  So, we played them before a sold out--in Louisville [Kentucky] before a sold out crowd, about sixteen, eighteen thousand people.  Kentucky was ranked, ranked number one in the nation, and we weren't supposed to be anybody.  We were kind of new to the scene.  And we were, we were giving it to them.  We were really giving it to them and we were fancy.  We were dunking and running, high five and stuff like that.  And Rup never set down and never stopped talking to the officials.  And the crowd was starting to go really crazy.  So at halftime, I think I had scored eighteen or eighteen points in the first half and we had to have the police carry us to the--to our locker rooms.  I can remember passing somebody in the hallway, one of Rup's staff said, "You won't play in the second half."  They hadn't--coach said, "Don't worry 'bout those people, that's crazy, you're all right."  But we could hear the N word all over the, the building shouted at us.  So we came back out in the first two or three minutes of the game, I fouled out so I only played like two minutes of the second half.  As I walked off the floor from one corner back in the bench, the big band they had struck up 'Bye Bye Blackbird.'  And the band played, you could hear the N word and everybody in the back was singing that song behind us.  And I just walked off and said--seventeen, eighteen years old, set down and covered my head because I didn't wanna be hit in the head.  So, we played on and old Gov [Govoner Vaughn] took over, and Gov took over the second half.  And Gov had one final shot that would've won the game.  And I think had we won the game, we wouldn't be here today to talk about it. I don't believe, that's how crazy that crowd was.  And the good fortune was he missed the shot and they were able to celebrate their winning.  Had he made that shot, we would've been national celebrities (unclear) because we beat the top team in the nation, you know, national champions.  But I, I doubt that we would've survived that night, that place would have gone crazy.  But that was a, a funny feeling because we had to wait in the locker room for a long time before we could leave.  The night before we'd gone out with our teammates, couldn't get into the theaters in Louisville, couldn't get in the restaurants so Gov and I roamed through the neighborhoods.  And that's the first time I ran into friends of Cassius Clay [Muhammad Ali] at that time.
Story_ID: 595809
Speaker 1: So Champaign [Illinois] is not the friendliest place socially for you?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a place you'd go to for, for good times and friendship and fellowship and that stuff.  It would not have been.
Speaker 1: Now you mention, after that game [against the University of Kentucky], wandering the streets with you and Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] kind of going around through town [Louisville, Kentucky].
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we'd--we couldn't go to a theater and we couldn't go to a restaurant so we met a black fellow on the street that said, "Hop in the car we'll take you someplace."  We went to, to, to the hood and that's where we met, you know, Cassius Clay's [Muhammad Ali] friends and him and people.  And we went to a big glass bar, a nightclub.  And I remember them telling stories about Cassius and, and just wanted to know more about who we were from this, "You all's school up north [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois]," you know.  And it end up being a great night.
Speaker 1: Did you actually meet him?
Speaker 2: I met him at that time but I, I didn't meet him that night.  I met him on the trip though.  And I just remember thinking well, he had, he had been an Olympic fighter and I just thought how much more fortunate than I was playing basketball and getting beat up at fights.
Speaker 1: Was his personality, if you can recall during that time, the same person we all know?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Would you call him more subdued or more (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) More subdued, more subdued, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 595810
Speaker 1: The other influence on my life back then was with Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] because Jesse came at Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] at our sophomore or junior year.  And Jesse came in as a quarterback, and with the names Jackson, we were kind of locked together in a lot of things.  So Jesse and I became really close friends.  And I'd never heard--I'd never in my time heard anybody articulate the racial issue in the way that Jesse could.  And I thought at the time he was overdoing it, 'cause he wasn't mad, he just didn't take any stuff.  And he had, he had words to back it up.  We'd always say F off or kick (unclear), he could talk about it.  And that first time I heard someone talk about it, and it started me reading on, on, on race relations.  The other thing with Jesse was he, he just didn't do it in the backroom, he would take the man on.  When they didn't have him playing quarterback, nobody wanted to stand toe to toe with Jesse and justify why he was gonna be playing quarterback.  And when the coaches had problems with someone, they'd say you must have gotten that from Jesse Jackson.  And at that time it was kind of like, better be careful but as time went on after that and even today I think one of the greatest things that happened to me was running into him.  Because it really changed and escalated my consciousness, I mean, instantly which would never have happened without him.
Speaker 2: Were you all close on campus?
Speaker 1: We were close.
Speaker 2: Tell us about your friendship, you know, and the things you discussed sometimes that changed your life or changed your thinking.
Speaker 1: Well, Jesse had a capacity of, of--which he has today, he's very, very smart.  And his tremendous stamina and I don't know where he got his fearlessness from.  He's not afraid--I think--I don't know if we were afraid, just that, we just didn't do things.  And if we got in situations that were uncomfortable, we, we were in uncomfortable situations that we just didn't operate as well in.  Jesse could move to a uncomfortable situation and continue to operate, continue to be cool and articulate things and well beyond his years.  And we'd freeze, we meaning most black males would freeze, but Jesse could keep operating.  And he was the same guy in the--in a bar or in the backroom of the, of the dormitory as he would be standing on stage talking to the white infrastructure.  He just didn't change, his persona didn't change.  Just as articulate and just as committed to the issues, plus he was so well read.  He knew stuff and should have been an all-American, Big Ten [Big Ten Conference] all-American quarterback and all that stuff.
Speaker 2: I was gonna ask you was he a good athlete?
Speaker 1: He was great, great athlete, 6'2" weighed about 220 pounds then, was fast, smart, good hands, good eyes, great leader.  I mean, today he'd be a, he'd be a, a--what do you call it, a, a lottery pick at his size and speed and that but they didn't want any part of not just a black person as, but part of Jesse Jackson being, being a leader.  And that bothered me a lot.  And fortunately I was kind of winding down my career but, but he sure--I learned a lot from him.  I, I saw things that I'd not seen before.
Speaker 2: Was he involved in any on campus groups or was he the leader or did he start anything on campus at that point?
Speaker 1: I don't think so.  I don't know, he, he may remember doing that I don't remember that happening.  Jesse was a very, very good personality.
Speaker 2: Did he articulate his aspirations to be a minister at that time?
Speaker 1: No, no.  In fact, I was surprised years later when I'd heard he was a minister.  I knew that Jesse was gonna be a leader and I knew that whatever he put his hands into he was gonna do well.  I never thought Jesse would leave the South; he was a southern, southern guy.  I never thought he'd leave the South, so when he showed up in Chicago [Illinois], that was a surprise to me.
Story_ID: 595811
Speaker 1: Now what years were this when you and Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] were--?
Speaker 2: Would have been '58 [1958], '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: And now, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] is kind of moving around now slightly, is he, is he making you have any mention of Dr. King's movement?  Is he bringing this to your--
Speaker 2: No, no, I--Dr. King came through Champaign [Illinois] and I met him as I met all the entertainers and personalities and lecturers when they'd come to the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Campaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois].  I'd be their host and work with them, I met, met hundreds of people doing that.  Met him doing that and later I met, met Dr. King--Jesse introduced me to Dr. King.  And the other capacity that Jesse was to subordinate himself to another black person.  Because if you would be around him now, he would, he would forget he's Jesse Jackson and tell stories about you.  He was, he's always been that kind of guy.
Speaker 1: Do you know if that was the first interaction that he had with Dr. King possibly?
Speaker 2: No, I think he had interaction before, and certainly when he went back to North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] 'cause I used to read about he was involved with SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and all that, that stuff, yeah.
Story_ID: 595812
Speaker 1: You've done some big things on campus basketball wise.  You said you weren't 100 percent happy socially there [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], you're getting close to the end of--well, before we go on, was there anybody else there on campus really influential besides Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson]?  Was there anybody else you want to bring up?
Speaker 2: You know, no one stands out.  You know, Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] was, was a mainstay.  I would not of made it, and I say this many times and more as I get older, I would not have made it without Govoner.  It meant a lot to have someone next to you, to have a male friend and someone who, that, that you could count on and that shared common goals with.  And we--he rooted for me like I rooted for him.  His, his mother kept a scrapbook on me that was this thick.  And his influence and friendship craft a lot of my belief in partnerships and alliances, and how you can depend on other people.  And that meant a lot to me, that, that had a great influence in my life.
Story_ID: 595813
Speaker 1: How were your academic grades doing at this point, how were you doing in school?
Speaker 2: No problems, we, we finished early.  We both could've graduated, you know, the semester before or a year.  And I was taking courses at another school and Gov [Govoner Vaughn] was taking courses too--we, someplace else.  We were given courses to take because they didn't believe us academically, they didn't believe our test scores.  But they were more interested in us being eligible, which I applaud them for that because we graduated early and on time and that stuff.  But it wasn't moving toward, you know, the kind of background we wanted, it was more toward graduating.
Speaker 1: What was your major at this point?
Speaker 2: We were both majored in liberal arts and, and (unclear) into our being coaches.  But Gov wanted to be--I think Gov was taking summary psychology and I was taking business courses.
Speaker 1: Now was this out of the norm for an athlete to be so academically astute or, or was this normal back then that all the athletes also tried to do as well as they could academically?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was, I think it was out of the norm.  I think there were great student athletes there [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], a number of really, really fine student athletes.  But I think it was out of the norm.  I don't think anyone expected us to be doing it.
Speaker 1: What are some of your thoughts, not to digress to far, but about athletes, athletes and education today?
Speaker 2: Oh, I think the whole matrix of athletes and education and, and responsibility is very flawed today.  I think it's been flawed by the images that are on television and flawed by the images of defining success.  I think young people are really screwed up early because of that.  And many of them take that steps so far down the line, it's no way to get back.  And by the time they figure out that the system was flawed, time has passed.  And I think we, we're doing young athletes a real disservice, young student athletes.
Speaker 1: So you and Govoner had a--since high school [Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois], you had a chance to really focus on your academics and to say, okay, we have to do this as well as our sports careers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that influence came two, two sources.  One, we happened to run into a good coach that was strong, stronger than--that didn't let us get out of line.
Speaker 1: And what, what school are you
Speaker 2: That's Joe Lucco.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we both had families that we never got out in front of our families.  And I think it's really sad when, when kids can love their parents but don't listen to their parents, they're listening to another voice someplace.  And we--I don't think either of us ever got outside the voice of our families, and we had the influence of Lucco and others that helped us.
Story_ID: 595814
Speaker 1: So now you're getting ready to get toward the end of your college career, you're moving forward.  You've done great things at the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], what was, what were your thoughts about your next step in life?
Speaker 2: Had a chance to play professional basketball and the choice was to join the Harlem Globetrotters because they've been recruiting me since I was out of high school [Edwardsville High School, Edwardsville, Illinois].  And to Saperstein's [Abe Saperstein] credit he said, "Finish college and there's a job."  Had a chance to do that and had a chance to looked at--wanted to go to the NBA [National Basketball Association], we talked about that but there were only like eight or nine teams in the NBA and most of the teams had quotas so it was very few jobs to get.  And most of the NBA players were, were not academics at that time.  The academics were going to the Industrial Basketball League [National Industrial Basketball League].
Speaker 1: Now what, what was that league?
Speaker 2: That was where major corporations had sponsored teams.
Speaker 1: Corporations actually had their own teams?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Peoria Caterpillars, the Akron Goodyear [Akron Goodyear Wingfoots], Forestville Oil Company [ph.], San Francisco Investors, New York Tuck Tapers, a manufacturing for tapes.  There're probably fifteen to twenty teams around the country that, that brought in good students who could be in their management programs, that also played basketball.
Speaker 1: So, so rather than being in having to worry about endorsements back then, the team was actually owned by the corporations?
Speaker 2: By the corporations, they traveled worldwide, played a schedule of, you know, seventy-five to a hundred games a year.  And when I heard about that, that's what I wanted to do.
Speaker 1: There was a chance to actually have a job in business as well as play basketball?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's what I wanted to do.  I didn't realize that most of that league was white players though, I mean, fewer black jobs in that league than in the NBA.  But there's a team in New York that was owned by a man named Paul Cohen, and he owned that--a tape company [Technical Tape Corporation] out of New Rochelle [New York].  And they manufactured pressure sensitive tapes.  And one of his players had played against us and--Gov [Govoner Vaughn] and I in college, and when Paul Cohen was saying, "I don't wanna be the embarrassment of this league, I'd like to get somebody who can do this and that."  This player recommend that he give me a call.  And when he called me I said, "Let me bring Govoner out with me too," so the two of us went out there and I liked it 'cause I got a good job and it felt right.  I was learning really well and the next go round looking at guys and met so many black ballplayers trying out then for so few jobs.
Story_ID: 595815
Speaker 1: Was that Paul Cohen, Cohen of the Tuck Tape company [Technical Tape Corporation], was it Tuck Tape?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was, he was a powerful guy.  And a good guy.
Speaker 1: What did you learn from him?
Speaker 2: Well, he had a handicap at the time and I learned a lot about his, his attitude about, about, about marketing and about sales because I wanted to go into sales right away.  I remember one time he said, "You know, salespeople are, are the people who paint pictures and they're teachers.  So I want you to paint a--learn how to paint a picture for me first."  And he described what that picture was.  It wasn't literally painting; it was just telling a story in a way that you could visualize outcome.  And good salespeople are also teachers, and that meant a lot to me.  So he put me on a city desk and believe it or not in those days I had, I had a good voice.  So when they'd call into the city desk most of the people calling in for tape didn't know if I was black or white, thought I was southern guy.  And Paul taught me some stories to tell and so I was selling tape by phone all over the country, and I was also servicing the accounts.  And Paul had good responses from people saying who is this guy that I been talking to.  And Paul let me teach one of the classes once as part of his thing about teaching.
Speaker 1: A sales class?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I taught sales class, which is kind of amazing 'cause I couldn't go on the road and sell but I could teach the sales class.
Speaker 1: So you're teaching classes and you're also the--one of his starters for team [New York Tuck Tapers]?
Speaker 2: One of the basketball team, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now how did you juxtapose the two, the two things because lot of times people think nowadays that if they're doing one thing then they can't do another.  How did you juxtapose practicing and working?
Speaker 2: Well, they worked that out.  Most of the twelve ballplayers that were retained all of us had jobs doing something.  I had the most visible job because I was dealing with the public.  There were some guys that were in accounting and some in doing engineering work, but I was actually dealing with the public.  What kind of threw it sideways we were playing games at the--in Manhattan [New York] at the 27th Regiment Armory [sic. 69th Regiment Armory] or something like that, and Paul Cohen bought TV time in New York City [New York, New York] from nine o'clock 'til midnight on Saturday nights.  So every Saturday night, we'd play, you know, on television so you'd walk out of the games and people on the street would know you, go in the bars they'd hear about you.  They know the games we were playing so it, it--I was no secret that I was--who I was after the first season.
Story_ID: 595816
Speaker 1: Now, what happened is it got to be--I felt, I felt good.  Govoner [Govoner Vaughn] came back through town; he had joined the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters].  And I went down to Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] to see the Globetrotters play. It was one of those times when I had worked like sixteen hours that day [for the Technical Tape Corporation] and I was tired of working, and was getting ready to go practice the hard work you say.  And these guys are sitting back in the locker room having a good time.  And Saperstein [Abe Saperstein] happened to be there, and he said, "I think that you're making a mistake by, by working."  He said, "You're a lot--your career is really short."  He said, "You're a good basketball player and you can do good things here."  And I said, "I don't want to be a basketball player."  He said, "You need to see the world."  I said, "Well, if you can let me see the world, I might think about it."  He said, "Well you show up on May 2nd or whatever it was, I'll put you on a tour that'll stay out of the country for a year."
Speaker 2: Well, before we get to that, were you still looking at the NBA [National Basketball Association], because, you know, that's, that's the icon of, of the league at that point?  Were you still looking to see what they're doing?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: How was--well, if you can recall from it, 'cause I know you were watched as far as--maybe not for yourself but what was going on racially at that time with the NBA?  Was it, was it easy for players to get in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, it was hard.  In fact, the--New York [New York] was a little better and Boston [Massachusetts] was better but the other teams had quotas, two players.
Speaker 2: They had actual quotas?
Speaker 1: Actual quotas.
Speaker 2: And why was this, you think?
Speaker 1: Newspapers would write up and the intellects at the league at the time would say that white people didn't wanna see black stars up close and personal.  And who wants to take their kids out to see a black ballplayer go up and down the court.  And, so therefore, we wanna make sure the league represents what the public wants.  And I thought about at one time and I can remember thinking myself, that makes sense.  You know all kind of crap makes sense to you when people tell, tell it--but, no, that, that was the think that I didn't--I wasn't really respectful of the NBA back then.  I knew guys who'd played there, we played against them every summer.  I knew guys who came into the industrial league [National Industrial Basketball League] that couldn't make it, that'd been in the NBA and I knew guys that left the industrial league and gone to the NBA.  I knew what I was earning, I knew the lifestyle I had and I felt pretty good about it. But when Abe came to me and said, "I can send you out of the United States, you can go to--I can have you in Paris [France], I'll have you in Helsinki [Finland], I'll put you in Hong Kong and you'll be a celebrity worldwide plus you'll learn about these cultures.  And I'll be traveling too and I'll take you under my wing," that was persuasive.  I remember I went back to tell Paul Cohen that and he said, "That son of a bitch."  He said, "That's what I mean when I say stories and painting a picture.  He's painted a great picture and that's a great story."  I said, "Paul, would you do it?"  He said, "No, I'm a crippled old man I wouldn't do it, but," he said, "if I were twenty-one years old and built like you, I probably would be persuaded."  He said, "When you come back here there'll be a job."  I said, "You're telling me I can go?"  He said, "You should go, there'll be a job working when you come back.  That's a great story" (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So what did you do?
Speaker 1: So I drove to Chicago [Illinois] and went to--up on Dearborn [Street] and went to Paul's office--Abe's office said, "I'm here."  He said, "I knew you'd come."  And within two days I was on an airplane flying to Italia, flying to, to Rome [Italy].
Speaker 2: So, now, you and Govoner are back together again?
Speaker 1: No, Gov has split off, he's gone.
Speaker 2: Oh, he's gone.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's gone.
Speaker 2: Where is he now?
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened.  I've asked Gov.  Gov left the Globetrotters and went to the American Basketball League.
Speaker 2: The ABA [American Basketball Association]?
Speaker 1: The ABA.  And he had a--like a year there, and I don't know what happened to him after that.  We haven't talked a lot about what happened to his basketball career.  I, I kept on going and I think Gov had family obligations.  I don't know exactly what happened to Gov from that point on.
Story_ID: 595817
Speaker 1: Can you give us a little just insight because you didn't necessarily play for them but you'll have a idea.  What was the average salary of a NBA [National Basketball Association] player during those days (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I knew exactly what it was.  Yeah, 'cause like, you know, Don Ohl was there and several of the players that--they were making eighty-five hundred a year is kind of the average, eighty-six hundred, eighty-five hundred.  So I did the numbers, I said I'm making more than that doing what I'm doing, plus I'd have to put up with all the crap.  And I live a better life.  So it wasn't a lot of money being, lot of money difference and, you know.
Speaker 1: I talked to some other athletes who played football. Many of them said they had other jobs.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, you always had to get a job in the summer.
Speaker 1: Even, even in the, in the professional leagues?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, you had no money.  And one of the biggest contracts I'd heard in my life was [HistoryMaker] Oscar Robertson called one time and he said, "I just signed a three year contract with Cincinnati [Cincinnati Royals; Sacramento Kings] or somebody," and he said, "You won't believe how much money I got."  And he said, "Ninety thousand, a hundred thousand a year."  A year?  No, for three years.  So he was making like twenty-five, thirty thousand a year.  And I thought, that's good.  But I added it up and I thought if I worked twelve months I could make almost that much.  No, I wasn't impressed with that at all back then.
Story_ID: 595818
Speaker 1: So you go to the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters] and you've just shifted gears so to speak.
Speaker 2: I felt bad, I really felt bad.  I--'cause Paul [Paul Cohen] was correct, he said, "You now know what it means to paint a picture and, and to, to have been told a story and been taught."  He said, "Saperstein's [Abe Saperstein] a good--he's good."  He said, "I don't think it's right but you should do it."  And he was, he was right.  I, I did it, it was a good experience.
Speaker 1: So you were--your first trip was to where now, you were telling us?
Speaker 2: I went to--we started out in Rome [Italy] and then we end up in London [England] and crossed Western Europe, and then went into Eastern Europe and into Russia, and then made the next loop over to Hong Kong and into, to the Far East.
Speaker 1: What was the overall mission of the Globetrotters?  Was it entertainment as well as sports prowess?  What was the mission at that--or was it highly competitive?
Speaker 2: It, it was competitive 'cause I wasn't a great entertainer back then.  But anybody who would play us, we'd play them and--so we'd play seven days a week but typically he would come in and say this is for real guys.  We got something going now, we gotta win when you get back here, so we'd played--I remember we played a team out of Helsinki [Finland] and the German teams, and the Italian teams were always good.  And Abe'd say, "You gotta win."  And so there're only nine, ten of us, and we knew who the players were.  And he says, "That's why we got you over here."
Speaker 1: So at that point, the Globetrotters--'cause in my generation it was a little different thing.  They were, they were really playing ball competitively against all these other teams?
Speaker 2: Well, eight years earlier or nine years earlier, the Globetrotters had played the, the champions of the NBA [National Basketball Association] and beat them two years in a row in Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois].  So I never knew the Globetrotter as entertainers.  I just knew them to be the best basketball players that were out there.  And so when I went to the practices I couldn't believe how good these guys were, how many great ballplayers there were there.  But I realize now as you look now, imagine if only--let's see--if only sixteen black ballplayers could play in the NBA, and how many hundreds of others would be sitting around looking for a job.  Well the best ballplayers if, if they could make it, would go to the Globetrotters.  So years after, they beat the Lakers [Minneapolis Lakers; Los Angeles Lakers] they still played exhibition games against the NBA, and they played all the international teams, and played colleges and college all-stars around the world.  So Abe had a good format where you had to be able to play, and you had to be able to beat teams, and then you had to be capable of entertaining.
Speaker 1: So, you stay with them for how long?
Speaker 2: I stayed--made two tours in little over two years.  And I left and came back after that again.
Speaker 1: Who did you meet during your time period, did you meet any, any major luminaries during that time period of, of your traveling around the, the world?
Speaker 2: I met Khrushchev [Nikita Khrushchev], I had a chance to shake his hand.  And I met--I saw my second pope in 2000.  I met, you know, Pope John, John Paul II [Saint Pope John Paul II] is it and every country I went to we ran into all the, the generals and military officers and all the, all the top jazz artists were typically in, in the European cities playing the clubs.  We were always the toast of those cities when we'd go in.  I remember going to Austria in Vienna there's a club, Fatty George, and that, that--his nightclub was in a basement of a, a big hotel.  We always had the VIP seats after we played there.  And everybody you could think of would come through there.  Ella Fitzgerald and all the big names would come through there and we'd, we'd could mix with all the top, top stars at that time.
Story_ID: 595819
Speaker 1: So, you stay there about four years, '64 [1964] and you decide to leave the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters] and, and go elsewhere.  Why is that?
Speaker 2: Well, I had, had knee surgery in '63 [1963] and I also felt I was getting further and further away from what I really wanted to do and that was to be in business.
Speaker 1: So you still had your aspirations of business?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, that was a big thing for me.  So I, I went back to school, took some courses.  I was playing basketball and I met a guy that since become a pretty good--John, John Watson is his name, and John was working for General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] at the time.
Speaker 1: So where did you go after the Globetrotters, where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to school and I taught school.
Speaker 1: Where at, in which city (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Oh, in Detroit, okay.  So you went to Detroit and you went to start now working on your master's degree?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I started filling in all the holes I needed so they no one could say you weren't--didn't have the credential to do it.  And I met this guy, John Watson who was getting his master's degree from the University of Detroit [University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan].  And he said, you know, I said, "I could never get a job at General Motors, the kind of job I want."  And he told me about a man named Doc Oliver [ph.], who was on the front of psychological profile testing, predictive performance testing, which in late '60s [1960s] was kind of the rage at corporations.  And to this day I can remember going to Doc Oliver who John Watson introduced me to and he said, "What makes you think you should be at General Motors?  Largest corporation in the world, we can get anybody we want.  Least of all, why should we want a black man to come work here that's a ballplayer."  And I said, "Well, John thought I might be able to do the job."  And he said, "Well, John's a fool."  And I said, "Well, sorry to waste your time Dr. Oliver."  He said, "Well, you wait outside."  He talked to John for a long, long time about an hour.  And, and John came back and said, "Come back tomorrow, we're gonna give you the test."  And I said, "How long will I be here?"  And he said, "You're gonna be here all day."  And I can tell you, we took the Minnesota Phasic Far- Farmore [ph.] which is a facial relations test, we took the Wonderlic [Wonderlic Personnel Test], which is a twenty-six or twenty-eight-question IQ test, the adaptability, which is a three hundred or so question, you know, psychological profile test.  And we took one specially designed by Oliver, which was the ultimate, you know, test under pressure stress test kind of thing where you had to answer questions in a period of--think you go for ten seconds and twenty seconds and one minute.  And I came back the next day and I took the tests and by four o'clock in the afternoon Oliver came in and said, "Okay, well, we'll call you back."  And the next day he called me into the office and I went back and he said, "I think you cheated on the tests."  And I said, "I didn't cheat."  He said, "That f-in John Watson is your friend, he gave you the test."  I said, "John never gave me the test, never saw the tests."  He said, "I'm gonna test you again."  And he took the tests and went through the whole test thing again.  Kind of the same questions but formatted differently, and about halfway through it, he called me in and said, "You can stop, you passed, you've done well."  So here the upside of the story is, I had a twenty-eight on my Wonderlic and a fifty-six or so on the--one of the other--that special thing you get.  When Doc Oliver took me around to meet people after he hired me, he never introduced me as [HistoryMaker] Mannie Jackson.  I was always the guy that got the--this is the twenty-eight, he's a fifty-six.  And I used to look at him and say, "My name is Mannie Jackson."  And he'd say, "You played basketball.  He's fifty-six on the--this a twenty-eight here."  And I, I began to realize that people look at me and say maybe the guy can think through some problems.  And all it did was predict that through his own test I'd never gone back to see how close his prediction was.  But in my case I guess it would've worked out okay.  But all it was predict whether you could become a superintendent of a, of a factory or a factory foreman, or have a chance to be a general manager.  And each of the tests said I had a chance to be one of those, so I knew damn I well I wasn't gonna be a general manager of the Cadillac division.  I might be a foreman but I stayed with Oliver because I like his process.  He put me in charge of, charge of the institute, GMI institute [General Motors Institute].  And that was really interesting that I met a lot of engineering students.  I was able to monitor courses and set through stuff and got another dimension of education, and got business too.  But Oliver never saw me outside of that specialized psychological area.  And so when I came into Minneapolis [Minnesota] with Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.], they saw me as a general manager.
Story_ID: 595820
Speaker 1: Let's talk about that or a moment.  Now, you've, you've acquired your, your masters [degree] in what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I did not, I did not get a masters.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't have your masters yet?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're still in Detroit [Michigan] though?
Speaker 2: Still in Detroit.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in what year did you get your masters?
Speaker 2: I did not get a masters.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so you go on and you move and you go to Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: I leave, I leave school and I go to Minneapolis [Minnesota] to give a speech and I come off the stage.  And I met the chairman of the company who said, "We have spoken to, to Jim Oliver [ph.], we know him.  And we appreciate him bringing you out here and we know you're a twenty-six and we know you're a fifty-eight in all that stuff."  And he says, "If you ever want to run a business," 'cause I had said something in my speech about wanting to be a speaker--wanting to be a general manager and run a business, "we'd like to talk to you about it."  I said, "I can stay over the night and talk about it."
Story_ID: 595821
Speaker 1: Okay, Mr. Jackson [HistoryMaker Mannie Jackson], so you've gone to, you, you've gone to Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.] now.  You've taken a job with Honeywell (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep.
Speaker 1: And what were you in charge of there?
Speaker 2: I went to the aerospace and defense business; I was in charge of government compliance.  And it wasn't as Spencer [Edson Spencer]--the chairman told me the fact that I had a job in a particular business.  I went there to learn that industry.  And Honeywell impressed me for, for several reasons.  One, they were fast tracking me through, through the company but you had a chance to be in different geographic areas.  They were located around the world, around this country.  But they also were a holding company in aerospace defense and computers, and environmental controls and industrial controls.  And they had a number of different businesses there so I thought that's kind of nice so I can get in a bunch of businesses I can see where to invest at.  And I did that in government compliance for about nine months and I said, "This isn't right.  I drove a new Cadillac, I was over on Clark Avenue [Detroit, Michigan] in an office, I was a fifty-six and I, I was going someplace at General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company].  You got me in a damn factory talking to government people."  He said, "You're just getting your feet wet jut be patient."  And I said, "I'm gonna leave in September if something doesn't happen."  He said, "You not gonna leave, you can't leave."  And about August, September I got a call saying, "We're gonna acquire the computer interests of GE [General Electric] and I'm sending six people out and I want you on the team that goes out to do the acquisition."
Speaker 1: This is early '70s [1970s], right?
Speaker 2: You got it, you know the timing.  And by that way I also got a call from the Kentucky Colonels saying, "If you wanna get back in basketball we saw you play in this minor league thing out of, out of Grand Rapids [Michigan]."  There were like four, six cities that team Battle Creek [Michigan] had teams in that league.
Speaker 1: So you kind of kept a little slight interest going?
Speaker 2: I played basketball, yeah.  I kept playing a little bit.  You want to sign in this ABA [American Basketball Association], you can go do it.  I said, no, I'm gonna go out and do this--learn something about acquisitions and mergers.  That was a big decision I made in my career.
Speaker 1: Did you, did you have any family at this point like your own personal, a wife, or children, daughter?
Speaker 2: I had a wife, yeah, yeah I had a wife then.
Speaker 1: Let's go back a minute.
Speaker 2: I had a wife, but I was just divorced then.  I had been married for four years.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So, so continue now with the--
Speaker 2: So I went out to, to Boston [Massachusetts] and I not only got indoctrinated on computers of those days.
Story_ID: 595822
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  So you went out to Boston [Massachusetts] that's where we left off (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: Well, now you're at Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.], now how many African Americans are at the executive level right now?
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: You're the only one.
Speaker 2: Only one, yeah.
Speaker 1: So they acquired GE [General Electric]?
Speaker 2: They acquired the GE computer interest, the whole computer business.
Speaker 1: Okay, and they're gonna--he's gonna be sending out six people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're one of the six, and where are you all gonna go now?
Speaker 2: To Boston.
Speaker 1: Tell me about that?
Speaker 2: That was, that was interesting because 'cause we go out it was all clandestine, because they didn't want the, the Boston management to know they were acquiring this huge computer--about a million dollar computer company interest in General Electric.  So primarily this team of six and a team of about forty from GE did the early negotiations.  I didn't know shit about it, I just sat there and listened, got coffee, ran errands.  And my--I had a couple of assignments but mainly I was getting to know who the power brokers were on the other side.  And so we played golf, we spent time with them, we played basketball, we locked ourselves in the rooms and eventually the negotiations go down to the last six on each side.  When we acquired the company, then we had to decide how we'd integrate that into the existing Honeywell computer business.
Speaker 1: Were you thinking now and was your thirst for business being satisfied now?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Because now you're learning and doing what you always
Speaker 2: I'm at the top.  This is--this is feeling good now.
Speaker 1: Did you flash back to the country club and find yourself almost--
Speaker 2: Yeah, same deals, same deals.  Bankers were there, they were all there, we're talking in huge dollars and organization structures, who's gonna be in charge of what, and what technology we're gonna acquire, who's gonna get what jobs.  And visiting customers to tell them early we were gonna be now their new supplier rather than GE.  And I was like the token, token brother on that staff, and I was what, twenty-nine, thirty years old, thirty-one years old something like that.
Speaker 1: And was there one or two people who knew you and say, are you the manager I used to see who plays basketball?
Speaker 2: Very few, 'cause I never talked about basketball but once they saw me play, they'd say you, you're the--I know you were Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois] I saw you at--you played with Tuck Tape [New York Tuck Tapers] and stuff.  But no, it was really that good, a good situation because we came through it very successfully.  And when we got through that all of the, the executives on that either retired back in Minneapolis [Minnesota] are--we were earmarked to do something special from that.
Story_ID: 595823
Speaker 1: So you were then--this is in the '70s [1970s], how are race relations now?  You're--and you're living in--where are you living currently now?
Speaker 2: I was living in Boston (unclear) Mass [Boston, Massachusetts], yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're in Boston.  How are race relations in Boston?  How is life socially and racially now for you, you know, in your perception?
Speaker 2: You know what, I think they were--you know, Boston was a horrible city racially.  But I was so busy working, I was working sixteen, eighteen hours a day and travelling all the time and, and racism was like another obstacle to overcome in the work thing?
Speaker 1: How about inside of Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.]?
Speaker 2: It was there but the level I was operating at, you know, you heard a lot of stuff but you didn't, you didn't see a lot, you didn't feel a lot.  And it didn't get in my way.
Speaker 1: Were there any major influential people that you would like to mention of your--during your tenure in the '70s [1970s] at Honeywell?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I, I--no doubt about it that the gentleman named Bob Rose who, who was the general manager, president of the field engineering group. Dick Douglas [Richard Douglas] who was the president of all the computer business, and Ed Spencer [Edson Spencer] who was the chairman of Honeywell (unclear), and Ed Lawn [ph.] who was charge of this team that did the acquisition.  They all kind of adopted me and became mentors over me and I learned a lot from them.  Probably the biggest lesson I learned was we put everybody together one time to, to, to be trained to think like one.  And they'd divide us up into five teams, and I was the organizer of the event.  And 'cause we were at a Xerox [Xerox Corporation] training program.  Xerox was the training company for it.  I remember going to this hotel up at, at this college and two of the people didn't show up, and so they say, "Who's gonna be in charge today?"  And nobody raised their hand and everyone turned, "Mannie [HistoryMaker Mannie Jackson] you be in charge."  And it was kind of like everybody laughed, you know.  So that day I was in charge and the Xerox process of decision making--was one that I had embraced. And I remember sitting looking out over, you know, twenty-five, thirty people and realized I was in charge of all these Harvard [Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts] M.B.A.'s and MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] majors, and technical gurus from all over GE [General Electric] and Honeywell.  And I was calling the shots, and I stayed with the procedure.  Then after we got tired and all the credentials disappeared I realized it was street stuff.  Who's gonna F with who.  And I could talk as well as anybody, plus I knew a little bit and the process got me through the rest of it.  And that's when the light bulb went on and said, you know, I could be a general manager, I could run a company.  Because by the end of the day I had more stamina, I understood the issues pretty quickly, and also knew how to move people around, how to get people in the right position.
Speaker 1: Do you think training in basketball of having to do things and be--helped you?
Speaker 2: Very, very close to sport, very close to sport.  And it all comes together that night at the bar.  You go the bar and things change.  When you got your suits on, you got your desk and all the paraphernalia that gives you authority, you got one game.  But once you walk into an open room and on a level playing field, I knew at that point I could be a leader, I could do it.
Story_ID: 595824
Speaker 1: So in the '70s [1970s] you, you were doing those different things at Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.]--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and as the '80s [1980s] emerged, you're still there but now you had different roles.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what happened that when I finished my, my purgatory assignment out in, in Boston [Massachusetts], they made me a factory manager down in Florida in Tampa to further see if I could handle stuff.  And I did that, then I told Spencer [Edson Spencer] again I said, "I'm ready to run, run a business."  He said, "Well, every business has a leader right now."  Said, "You're making a lot of money," said, "you've done more than anybody else who does."  Said, "That's not how I wanna run a business."  So he called me one day and he said, "We got a business for you to run."  I said, "Where is it?"  He said, "You gotta start it."  I said, "Again I'm getting hard--that's a hard time.  Give me one of these nice offices where people are already doing something."  He said, "It doesn't work that way, Mannie [HistoryMaker Mannie Jackson].  You gotta start this one up."  So I started a business up inside the company.  And I was combining technologies and customer bases from three different business to make it into one.
Speaker 1: What was it called?
Speaker 2: It was called communication services, but what it was, was combining building controls, computers and telecommunications into one, one platform.  So there was a common technical platform for a building operated in order to choose from and try to build a national business out of it.  We didn't have a product, not an integrated product, and we didn't have a salesforce yet.  So I had five years to get it together.
Speaker 1: So what year would this have been approximately?
Speaker 2: It's about in '82 [1982], '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, by 1987 we took the business to get on net sales to about 80 million and in gross sales about 200 million.  We were doing 20, 25 percent in operating profit. And the reason our operating profit had gotten so attractive because I was the service guy.  I didn't know anything else other then serving people, I never, never gotten the product stuff.  And we sold a few products but everybody wanted us back to service their other stuff, and I felt we were on to something.
Story_ID: 595825
Speaker 1: Well, we started cutting back, paring back our business the whole company in '87 [1987] or '88 [1988] and my company got set up to be pared back, to be torn down.  So I went to Spencer [Edson Spencer] and I said, "I'd like to buy it."  And I knew some people who would help me buy it.  He said, "You can't afford to buy a $200 million business."  I said, "I can, I can do it."  He said, "No, I don't mean money."  He said, "It'd be damaging.  You acquired eight or nine companies, you can't go to the board of directors and appear to be self-dealing.  If now we sold you the company, you know, it'd be discounted."  He said, "Just stay with it, don't worry about it."  So we tore the business apart and I moved to corporate headquarters.  I'm sitting up there at the top floor of the corporation without a job.  I got a job but it's not, not what I wanna do.  So I did that for about a year and then I started buying little businesses.  And when I say buy, I started investing in little business.
Speaker 2: For instance, what types did you--were you--
Speaker 1: Oh, we had to, we had to wait for a technology business I bought into.  I bought a series of health clubs, I got involved in, in a transportation business, trucking business.  But I invested in them, and each of the investments paid off crazy, they did well.  And I found myself being chairman of those companies and I was still working at Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.].  And then the Globetrotter [Harlem Globetrotters] thing came along.  In 1992, I was reading--sitting alone in my work office, one of the banks, they said, "Look, here's some companies that are in bankruptcy and trouble.  I got an opportunity for you if you'd like to buy the company."  And I said, "I don't wanna go to no auction.  Where is the banker that's hurting the most with this debt?"  I think it was also $100 million worth of debt the Globetrotters were in.  He said, "It's National Westminster [National Westminster Bank] of London [England]."  And I'd go back to the story that Paul Cohen once said, "You gotta teach and you gotta have a--you gotta be able to paint a picture.  You gotta be able to." I wanna go out and teach and I wanna go out and do it, paint a picture to these people.  So I got on a plane and I went out to New York [New York], to the New York office.  And all I thought about was I gotta teach these people about the Globetrotters, about business.  I gotta construct a picture so I'll become the one they wanna sell it to, to take it over.  And after about four or five meetings, they said, "You're gonna be the person but you gotta have cash."  So I came back to Minneapolis [Minnesota] and I start putting people together to do it, but that was hard.  I wanted to do it with black folks, all black folks do it.  But nobody wanted to hear my story, look at my picture.
Speaker 2: And why do you think that was?
Speaker 1: First of all, didn't have any money to begin with.  They had cars and mortgages and fur coats.  They didn't have any money though.  And I didn't realize we were so undercapitalized as a race.  But that's--what do you expect, we didn't have good jobs.  And we're talking major, senior capital there.  But I never appreciated how undercapitalized we were as a race.  And so I called on some white friends and I said, now I gotta deal with white friends who are--have great capital.  I'll be working for them, I didn't like that.  So I met a banker out there and I told him the--this story.  And said, "Well, you gotta construct a buy agreement so this doesn't happen."  And we construct the buy agreement that allowed me to buy the bank out in two or three years (unclear).  And we could also buy out the investors at a multiple, and he said, "The lesson here is you gotta work your butt off so in a short time this buy period you can buy folks up otherwise you'll be working for somebody else the rest of your life me and everyone else."  But I bought the company with my investors and we did a great job with the company.  And I bought the investors all but one, and I bought the bank out, accelerated the bank buyout for five and a half million.
Story_ID: 595826
Speaker 1: Now, what year was this when you actually purchased the Globetrotters [Harlem Globetrotters]?
Speaker 2: Purchased it in '93 [1993], August 3, 1993.  And did the buyouts in '95 [1995].
Speaker 1: So within two years, was that, was that expected?  Probably not.
Speaker 2: Not at all. In fact, I was gonna close the business down.  I was so disenchanted with it, our first thoughts strategically was to, to shut it down and, and take the, the team--all the memorabilia I could find and put a museum together like, you know, Negro baseball league.  But I wanted to do theme restaurants around the country with that Globetrotter theme and all the memorabilia and stuff.  And I thought there are some cities where I could either do it with young people, kids, or old people who had memories, so I gotta figure out how I wanna do this.  But it's a good way to start I'd take a licensed product, the story, I wanna do a movie and books and stuff like that. (Unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did you feel there was a gap in Globetrotter knowledge, because in my life it was Curly Neal [Fred "Curly" Neal] and Meadowlark [Meadowlark Lemon].
Speaker 2: Yeah but that's, that's true with great brands, it tends to go, tend to by generation.  And every, every generation has a gap so the trick is to, to make sure that the next generation picks it up and at some point you make a--my point was to make an offering that would you back into the fold, give you a reason to come back.  'Cause you wouldn't come back at the same level you were at when you were twelve.
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 2: But there's a way to bring you back. And so I, I thought about that as a story and I went to Columbia Pictures and I went to the movie people and all that.  And I watched the team one day and I thought, this isn't bad.  The globe is big and the world is big, and we got players that want to play and people know you.
Story_ID: 595827
Speaker 1: And so we start wandering around all the buildings I'd gone to with Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.] that I'd worked with before and I got some deals with Bill Links [ph.].  I said, "Look, I know all you folks in my other life, give me a chance to do this."  And four or five buildings said, "Look, we're gonna give you sweetheart deals.  We're gonna, we're gonna take care of you and we'd like to see you do it well."  So in 1995, I was able to buy out the investors.  And I bought out the, the bank and we had twelve, eleven consecutive years of double digit growth.
Speaker 2: What your reaction when you come back with the money so to speak?
Speaker 1: Well, timing is everything in life.  The bank hated me, 'cause we're making payments on time and, and they knew something was up and I wasn't talking to them.  I mean, the guys that have been friends, I'd been kind of like down when I first met them.  I now was taking a stronger position like I knew everything, you know.  I didn't know crap.  But the bank didn't like me at all.  But I was talking a big game, I was getting my name in the paper and I was on the cover of Wall Street Journal [The Wall Street Journal], and I was putting people down, telling a story, painting a picture.  But National Westminster Bank [London, England] was having trouble, so they shut their U.S. operations down, so I went back in I knew it was a perfect time to go in.  Nobody gave a shit.  The bank was going out of business and all it was boxes and crates, and everybody was bad about losing their jobs.  And I was a piece of paper in the corner saying, you got one piece of paper you gotta clean up before you leave otherwise what's gonna happen, you get nothing.  So my negotiation point started with somebody who said, "I'm not gonna have a job next week, the bank's shutting down, (unclear) we're gonna close the U.S. operations down and I've gotta clean up this box of stuff here.  What's your deal?"  I said, "My deal's a good one.  You don't have to deal with that crap I had that two years earlier some of the time."  He said, "Okay, how fast can you generate the money?"  I said, "I can write you a check right now."  That was just another sheet of paper to tear up put in the corner.  For me it was generational.
Speaker 2: Here you are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Timing's everything.
Story_ID: 595828
Speaker 1: Here you are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Timing is everything.
Speaker 1: --you're doing business.  Now, when you first got the Globetrotters, they had some older players on there and things, and there was a, a feel of the Globetrotters.  Did you have a new, a new vision for the Globetrotters?
Speaker 2: No, my vision was this, and it's something I learned in the broader corporate world.  The Globetrotters were a great brand, arguably the greatest brand on the planet.  I mean, the facts sustained for now eighty something years.  And had been in everybody's home through television, you couldn't find hardly anybody in Africa or China or Australia that at some point couldn't tell you a Globetrotter story.  Usually a warm story, a warm memory.  So the brand had so much equity, it's just a great brand.  There's a gap between people knowing it and amount of moneys being received for that.  I said I gotta close--if I closed the gaps just a little bit, I'll be a wealthy man, everybody around will be wealthy.  I gotta get the gap going.  So I knew it was a great brand so my plan was to take the brand, Harlem Globetrotters, and make it significant to the people who remembered it and also create some interest in this next generation.  So I said how do you--what made it great?  So my mind went back fast to Abe Saperstein.  Why did people buy into the Globetrotters in the beginning?  Why was it so popular in those small white towns in Iowa, Wisconsin and places in the '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s]?  Why did black folks grove--go in droves to Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois] and root for these guys back in the '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s].  What made them so damn popular?  What did Abe know the rest of the world didn't know?  And I started picking off the things that I thought were significant, and I went to some of the old timers and say, "What do you think?"  And some of these guys could hardly talk or they didn't think in business terms.  They'd ramble, like I'm rambling now and out of that we'd get nuggets of information.  So I went back to the staff and said, "Look, we're gonna create a brand outta the Harlem Globetrotters.  And the brand is gonna deal with four or five areas that made them significant over the years."  And I can tell you what those are right now.
Speaker 1: Sure, please (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one thing if you think of the Globetrotters, they were always known being a championship team.  No team had won as may championships, had more people happy by a victory and no one had beaten the lead champions of back to back years and celebrated so greatly.  And worldwide they beat every team they ever played.  We're gonna rebuild a championship team again.  Secondly, when you think of the Globetrotters anywhere, you think of people who did good things, goodwill.  They were the toast of popes, they went to every country, they were at every hospital, boys clubs.  We're gonna be good people again, ambassadors again.  So we're gonna do that.  The next thing I said the Globetrotters became known for wherever you went to see a Harlem Globetrotter, you always had--you could take your family, you could feel safe if you went there with your kids and you could tell your kids your story and they'd create their own stories.  So I had to create a family friendly environment and create all my advertising and images around moms and dads, aunts and uncles, old guys in their forties and fifties taking their kids out and sharing memories.  And the last think I said was, you know, with all the crap that's going in professional sports, I wanna be the pillar or the lighthouse for a responsible run business.  So we're gonna publish all our financial results, we're gonna tell people how we're doing, we're gonna be honest, gonna give to charities and we're gonna show the bottom line all the time.  We're gonna always hold ourselves to the highest standards to run this business the way Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.] would do, the way General Motors [General Motors Corporation; General Motors Company] would do.  Even though we weren't, weren't a public company.  Those are the four or five brand promises we had and I started running the company off those things there and I had department heads that had responsibility for those things.  And that's what they were responsible for, and they got rated.  They were started out as a one or six with one to ten, and when they got to eight and nine they got bonuses.  And we had the market tell us whether we were doing well or not.  And so, after about seven or eight years, we were all working these brand promises more than anything else.  No fancy words, we're just gonna go out and just do stuff that people like and people came to see us and they paid to see us.

Speaker 1: So now you, you've, you've looked back over the years and you've done it and what else is going on?  Are there any other organizations or any other activities that, that you are involved with at the same time that you're doing this--doing the Globetrotter [Harlem Globetrotters], you know, reorganization and rebuilding, are you doing anything else?
Speaker 2: I, I had to drop everything else.  I was on six Fortune 500 board of directors, I did that because I, I wanted to keep my hand in the Fortune 500 world.  And Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.] had put me on a two year leave because they didn't want me to leave at the time.  And they were really good about saying, "Do this for a while, I know you're gonna come back. This is probably isn't gonna work."  But I wanted to keep my hands involved in the corporate world, but on these board of directors I met incredible people.  I mean, I met the leaders of companies all over the country and the world, and they were helpful.  They allowed me to get into the big ad agencies and into the corporate sponsors, and they were also huge supporters, TV supporters and that kind of stuff.  But it got to be too much.  And so, there was a period of time from 1995 say or '94 [1994] until 2000 where life was just a blur.  I mean I had, I had--we played a game in San Francisco [California], an all-star team, a college all-star team in San Francisco on a Thursday we arrived in, in, in Oakland [California] and we had sold the place out, and we were playing these all-stars.  And Friday morning I get a call from London [England] and Prince Charles [Charles, Prince of Wales] says, "I want [HistoryMaker] Mannie Jackson to come over for a party on Saturday night.  And we're gonna do some stuff in the inner city, talking about entrepreneurs in--minority entrepreneurs in London.  And I want him to tell the white infrastructure why they should fund white and black entrepreneurs.  And we got a party to go to Saturday night."  Now, I stayed for the game, I have a plane pick me up after the game and I fly all night to London.  I get off the plane and Prince Charles' group pick me up and we go to a lunch and, we, we talk to maybe a thousand people.  We go to four meetings and have another lunch and we're talking to more people.  That night we got a party that goes to like four o'clock, I've gotta get back for a game the next night.  That same plane is sitting there for me, we're flying back across the Atlantic [Atlantic Ocean] and I think--I realize I haven't slept in three days.  On my third day without--had--sleep, and a life just kind of went like that for those years.  Nelson Mandela had one of his people call to say, "I want some help with this transition."  And in '95 [1995] and '96 [1996], Engen Petroleum had us over there for a month and we went to the Free Orange [sic. Orange Free State, South Africa] areas, we went to Soweto [South Africa] and we did the kind of good will work in those communities that made people feel like they could be together.  And on July 4th, we had a independence day celebration.  Two years in a row we fired fireworks over the Indian Ocean to talk about people coming together.
Speaker 1: Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And those--life was like a blur through that time for five years.
Speaker 1: Right, I'm gonna help you with your blur a little bit.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You, you also managed to give Lincoln High School Alumni Foundation [sic. Lincoln School Alumni Foundation, Edwardsville, Illinois] some money, you gave them some money over those times of years.  And you were--the Harvard Business Review, as you go into the 2000 now, did, did you officially retired from Honeywell [Honeywell International, Inc.] at that point?
Speaker 2: Officially retired.
Speaker 1: So, 2001 the Harvard Business Review publishes a first person account of your principles.  This is the Harvard Business Review, could you--how did you feel when you saw Mannie Jackson in the Harvard Business Review?
Speaker 2: It, it was good.  I mean, I--we played our, we played our twenty thousandth game in a little town in Indiana, and the next morning I woke up I was on the front page of The Wall Street Journal and then six months later the Harvard Business Review or sometime later they did their piece.  And it was still a blur, we were giving a--I give a million dollars a year away to charities.  We were honey like it never stopped, while most athletes were celebrating the nightclub and that stuff and doing--we were leaving money behind every place we'd go, we were making donations and contributions.
Story_ID: 595830
Speaker 1: Now we'll go into 2002, and a very big event I think for the Globetrotters in my opinion, we wanna know how you feel about it.  The Globetrotters are inducted into the Hall of Fame [Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, Springfield, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was a big deal, because the night I gave the speech on the induction, I made a couple of points I still remember today.  I said, "The Hall of Fame to me would never have been legit as long as it ignored the Harlem Globetrotters.  The Hall--the Globetrotters--the Hall of Fame would have been a facilitator of--or a myth as you allowed the world to believe that the Harlem Globetrotters are cartoon characters and not a significant contributors to not just sports in the world but to humankind around the world."  And I said, "Tonight represents the first night the Hall of Fame has now become significant and relevant, because how can you have a history of basketball and not tell honestly the story of a half a dozen, you know, black--young black athletes the Runt Pullins [Albert "Runt" Pullins], the Goose Tatums [Reece "Goose" Tatum].  These characters that through racism and all the crap that went on, put up with that shit and able to keep basketball and sport on its feet.  Not just in this country but in Russia and in China, when people were challenging and questioning the whole--the very nature of capitalism and democracy.  And here are the people, who should be less supportive of it, are there playing basketball and telling positive stories about this society.  And then comes back and beating every team in the world.  And you have a hall of fame for basketball and you don't have the Globetrotters there?  How could the NBA [National Basketball Association] celebrate fifty years of its existence and not even mention the Harlem Globetrotters?  Come on, that's not an accident, that's not an accident," (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is it safe to say that possibly you are to basketball and the Globetrotters what Wynton Marsalis has done with the legacy of Louis Armstrong, who also has been seen as a figure that, that wasn't significant for years until recently when we realized who he really was.  Is that a safe conclusion?
Speaker 2: I think it's, it could be but I think it's also clear to me now that part and parcel of capitalism and democracy is this tendency we have toward revisionists.  And I never realized how, how, how, significant that was until the last ten or twelve years.  People have the capacity through the storytelling initiative, when you start marketing and doing stuff, to completely take you out of history or reconstruct who or what you are and what you're about.  And there'll come a time when someone will probably stand on the corner and say there was never racism in this country, there was never school desegregation, there was never a time we had slavery in this country.  It's gonna happen one day because this country has a capacity of doing that kind of stuff when it gets involved in stories and painting pictures.  So what I found out is that the Hall of Fame, this hallowed place for basketball had constructed the pictures of basketball just started with Michael Jordon or Julius Erving.  And people like you, for example, would say, "I remember Curly Neal [Fred "Curly" Neal] and the cartoons."  I'm sitting here at sixty something, sixty-eight years old saying, "Are you shitting me."  Remember in Chicago Stadium [Chicago, Illinois] when Goose Tatum and, and, and Sonny Boswell and those guys were doing their thing like you never seen before, all black, and going to Paris [France] and going to London [England], and people coming out in numbers?  But see, kids'll believe it started with Julius or just started with, with, with, you know, some recent thing.
Speaker 1: So what can we do to alleviate and to avoid this?
Speaker 2: I think, I think what you do is, is you got, you got--people don't know unless you tell them.  And like I said in the lesson I learned from Jesse [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], I kept my mouth shut until I met Jesse.  And I still do it more than I like to do it but I know that I can talk.  I think we have to do for this society what sometime we don't like to do, and I think events like this are important.  And I think we can't ever forget--it's, it's not a racial thing, it's in every facet of our life.  There'll become a time they say families aren't important, or religious--religion isn't important because it's not the story we're telling this week.  And I think we have to be responsible enough to stand up for those, those things.

Speaker 1: What is your aspirations for African Americans and especially in business and just life in general in the future?
Speaker 2: Well, as long as you stay in this country, which is a wonderful country by the way (laughter)--baseball's been good to me, this country's been good for me.  I mean, who'd ever think that I'd create a $100 million plus worth of wealth through this crap I been talking to you about.  So it's a good country.  But as long as you stay in this country you have to learn how to play this game.  And I'm not saying that it's the perfect game, but it is the game that's played in this country politically, socially, when you think about democracy and capitalism.  Now, it, it seems to me if you're a parent and you don't like this game, you aren't arming your kids well if you tell them to play tennis when the world is playing soccer.
Story_ID: 595832
Speaker 1: So you were telling about parents arming their children. Even (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I mean, just to, to simply put it, this is a great country we live in but it's kind of like you gotta know the rules of the game and you gotta get involved in the rules of the game.  This, this is a country that's built around, you know, this whole marketing thing and capitalism and stuff, and the mainstream of this is, is that you can't do anything by yourself anymore.  I mean, it's not like you're taking a wagon and going out west and you can create you and your family by yourself.  You need help.  So these integrated skills you gotta have, and you gotta have business skills and marketing skills.  And why arm your kids to go to battle without having the right weapons?  And I don't care if you're running a church or running a school or--you're competing with people who are fairly sophisticated now at this stuff.  So what I would tell my kids is whatever you decide to do, find something you can be passionate about and you don't mind taking some blows and keeping going.  But also learn it in a way that allows you to be competitive, and it's learning.  And it's not necessarily sitting in Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], but it's learning.  And it's learning to be really good at something.  It's training, getting prepared.  And if you expect a handout or expect that someone owes you something, it isn't gonna happen.  And, if you go to someplace unprepared, it'll be like when you're in school you don't make it getting a D or a C plus. You can't live on a C plus, you gotta be a A student or a B plus to be good in this country.

Speaker 1: What do you think is your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think Al Martins, who was an executive with Xerox [Xerox Corporation], when we founded the Executive Leadership Council, which is the first group of black executives, blacks that broke through the executive level, he said our legacy will be that we were, we were first at something.  We were first not in religion where the religious leaders broke through or politics where politicians broke through but we were first economically.  And we paid a dear price for it.  And we probably won't benefit from it.  He died early and that kind of stuff (unclear). But I think my legacy will be that when I look back and think about my own life, how fast time goes.  How compressed the time is.  But how on each of these stops, these phases I've gone through I've been like a pioneer and the first at what happened.  The first to go through an all-white school and do well, the first to get into the corporate world and do well, an early entrepreneur that did well inside of a corporation.  The first to have a goal to give as much money back as I earned every year to charities around the world, and the first to, to build a, a legacy--not a legacy but a legacy that says I wanna--now that I've made all this money, I wanna begin to give back to pull some other people through.  And I think if it's right, maybe it won't be done for twenty, thirty, fifty, a hundred years or so, they say that dude did put some stuff back.  You know, it wasn't that hard back in the University of Illinois [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign-Urbana, Illinois], it wasn't that hard starting in business but nobody'd been there before.  Wasn't like I walk in and say show me the other people who've done this; no people of color had been there before.  So I think my legacy'll be, be the first in this short life we have.

Speaker 1: What is your admonition for young athletes with a aspiration in--they see the NBA [National Basketball Association], they see these different leagues, they're in school and they're making decisions should I stay in school, should I get out, what is, what is your advice to them?
Speaker 2: Well, my advice is, is simple.  The economics in professional sports is so compelling now that you get blinded by, by the possibilities.  So now you need a dose of reality.  The possi- no doubt the, the economics are there to make it possible for you to earn enough money to live really good on and do a lot of good things, but the reality is the possibility of your achieving that is very slim.  So while the possibilities are still slim, you need to hedge your bet through that phase while you can still do it so that you have a chance coming out the other side with something, 'cause it's a long way down from being cheered in Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] to being on the streets with nothing happening.  And too many of our, our young athletes don't realize the possibility of making, you know, life changing dollars is very, very slim and most of them fail.  And I, I really would say, it's not that it's not great possibilities but just the reality is it's a very slim chance.
Story_ID: 595835
Speaker 1: What would you say to current athletes that are making large amounts of money and are visible in regards to their responsibility?
Speaker 2: Yeah, what's the guy's name--it's a, it's a short season, life is a short season.  And money is probably--I heard someone say the other night, that I really agree with now that I've got money, is that money is probably the least significant thing about wealth.  And, if you don't have anything in your life that's significant other than money, it could be not a healthy experience.  So, I don't know that if someone put 50 million in my hands and I don't have any direction in life or any vision of what I wanna do with it, if I'm headed toward a direction of a healthy life or an important life or a significant life, and I would try to figure out a way to be significant.  What could I do that would make my time in the season I have significant?  And most of the athletes don't think that way because the people who are around them don't have that same experience.  They don't have people to reach out to, to talk about it.  And I would say you can't do this stuff by yourself, find somebody you can talk to about what will you do in your life that's significant, 'cause season is so short.
Story_ID: 595836
Speaker 1: What is the way--well, we, we, we mentioned legacy but Mannie, you know, you've done, you've done a lot of good, great things in your career, but [HistoryMaker] Mannie Jackson as a person, how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I--from in terms of a legacy?
Speaker 1: Well, just in general as far as the way you
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I just--I think that the facts will be that I was the first doing a lot of things.  And measured by, by, by the barometers in this society was successful doing a lot of things.  And economics any indication, I was stupidly successful.  But I think being remembered I think I just--I like the fact I have a family.  I been with the same woman [Cathy Jackson] now for thirty-three years, my daughters [Cassandra Jackson and Candace Jackson] are doing well.  I like the fact that I have relationships that are really important that I still value.  I like the fact that, when I look back and tell you that I did well in the last twelve years, I carry in my briefcase all the time a list of charities I gave to in the last twelve years.  And says I balance my life by giving back.  And I like the fact that I tried to understand what I was doing along the way.

Speaker 1: If you had one thing to say to everyone that's watching this about life, success, their futures, the places they're in, their feeling, what would you say as advice?  The main stroke or--of wisdom you could share with us right now.
Speaker 2: Well, life is a--life is short and it's not a sprint though and you have to set targets that are reasonable and attainable by yourself, and find somebody to share it with, share them with.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) Mr. Jackson [HistoryMaker Mannie Jackson], Adele [Adele Hodge]--if you have a minute, Adele has one question she wants to ask.
Speaker 2: (ADELE HODGE): What about women's professional basketball, your comments or feelings about that?
Speaker 1: The WNBA [Women's National Basketball Association] particular? Well, it starts with--to me the notion--I get asked questions like this all the time.  The notion that basketball is a tremendously popular sport worldwide.  And it's a sport that we, we all get attracted to at some level.  It also says that it's a sport being enjoyed in a lot of different genre- gen- genres. Is that the word?
Speaker 2: Genres.
Speaker 1: Genres. I mean, I like--I can be enthralled by wheelchair basketball, I like seeing youth play.  I think it's--what's that one game they have with the, the street ball thing?
Speaker 2: On one.
Speaker 1: On one, that's significant and cool.  So I think the genre of, of women playing is important to the game and an important form of the game.  I think the NBA [National Basketball Association] is a important form of the game.  I think they'd have you believe it's the only form of the game.  I think the Harlem Globetrotters are an important form of the game.  So I think, when I look at basketball in total, the WNBA is a great outlet for, for, for women and it's also to me it's another one of those parts of the game that we all can embrace.  It, it--the game has a reach for everybody.  And there're a lot of stories about the WNBA, and the reason it's not successful or not doing as well as it should do in this country is that--turn the camera off.
