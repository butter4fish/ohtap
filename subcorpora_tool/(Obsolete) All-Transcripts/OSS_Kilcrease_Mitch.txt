 Gill. Today is June 18, 2009. I   m visiting with Mitch  Kilcrease, who is director of the OSU Student Union. We   re on the  Oklahoma State University campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project, which is part of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Mitch, I appreciate you  taking time from all your duties to come over and visit with us this  afternoon.  Glad to be here, Jerry.  You know there   s a lot of questions I want to ask you about yourself  personally and about the student union, but I   d like to start, if you don   t  mind, with your early history. For example, can you tell us a little bit  about where you grew up, about your family life?  Yes. I   m the baby of a family of eight. I   ve got seven brothers and  sisters. I grew up in western Colorado over around Aspen. Colorado   s  where I grew up. I was born in Utah. My dad was a coal miner in  Arkansas, which is where he grew up. My mom and father, they moved  out west to Utah and worked in the coal mines, and then he got  transferred to Colorado about three years after I was born in Utah. I  grew up in western Colorado, a pretty idyllic setting to grow up in.  Pretty good childhood.  Well, how about what you did in high school, where you went, where  you grew up, about your school, and a little bit about that.  A small-town community, a little town called Paonia, Colorado. My  graduating class was seventy-two. I won   t tell you where I fell in that  ranking order, but it was a pretty small town. I often liken it to  Mayberry, R.F.D. My mom knew two minutes before I got in trouble  that I was in trouble. You know, you didn   t lock your cars. You left your  5  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  keys. You   d go on vacation for two weeks. You just didn   t worry about  things. People took care of their own and other kids. You   d be out until  dusk or dark, and you never really worried about your kids. Somebody  was always watching out after them; they knew where you were. So, a  very small-town mentality.  One of my favorite stories to tell is I lived a street off Main Street, and  my mom, who did not drive, would give me a grocery list. She would  write it, put it in an envelope with money, and pin it on my shirt. I would  take my red wagon and go to Main Street and the Star Mercantile in  town. They would take it off, fill the order, put the money back in it, and  with my little red wagon I   d go back home again. (Laughter) So, very  small town.  Were you into sports in high school?  Yes, sports and band. I played football, wrestled, basketball. Wasn   t a  star athlete by any stretch of the imagination, but always did those kinds  of things. I was probably a little bit more into speech and theater and  some of those kinds of things later on in high school.  And what was the name of the town again?  Paonia. It was actually named after peony, the flower peony, but they  couldn   t pronounce it, so it wound up being called Paonia. It was a small  farming ranch community and coal mines.  What do you recall about some of the values you learned about in a  small town growing up from your family and that influenced you later in  your life?  Like I said, it was a farming and ranching community, blue-collar  community, coal mines, so I learned a lot about work ethic. My dad was  a superintendent at a coal mine. We had a lot of ranchers and farmers in  the area, so I learned an awful lot about work ethic. A good day   s work  was rewarded, not always with money, but it was rewarded in how  people felt about you or how they thought about you. Small town with a  lot of churches, so religious values were very much a part of your day-to-  day life. And, like I say, it was about as close to being in Mayberry,  R.F.D. as you could ever possibly imagine. The sheriff knew your name;  they didn   t carry a gun. People just knew who you were, and there was a  lot of what I would consider small-town values. Your word was as good  as anything, a check or money. Your word was your honor, and when  you would give that, people took that, and that   s what they   d take to the  bank. So, a lot of those kinds of values.  6  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  So, where did you go to college? Can you share a little about your  higher education experience?  Yes, my college education is kind of an ironic one. In the town I grew up  in, a lot of kids in my area didn   t go to college. They would leave, and  they   d go in the coal mines. I mean, at eighteen years of age, you were  making eighteen dollars, twenty dollars an hour, which was pretty good  money, and that   s what I did. Right out of high school, I went in the coal  mine, and I probably would still be there today if it wasn   t for a single  incident. I got covered up in a coal mining incident. It wasn   t really bad.  I mean, people could talk to me, and I could hear what was going on.  My dad was there, and my dad was a superintendent, and so I could hear  his voice talking all the time. It took them a couple of hours because  they had to position stuff around the piece of equipment that I was in to  get me out, and then it was about a thirty-minute drive from the coal  mine to where I lived, and I drove home with my dad. And we didn   t say  anything, because he was trying to  figure out  how he was going to  explain to my mom what had happened. I was just trying to think  through it all. And we pulled up in the driveway, and I asked him,    Does  Mom still have those college brochures?    It scared me enough that I  figured I needed to do something else. So, I spent the first nine months  out of high school working in a coal mine.  Then I went to college, and to give you a sense of how kids choose  college today versus how I chose college, completely different. My  whole criteria was  that  I wanted to be far enough away from home, but  I wanted to be able to get a decent meal and my laundry done. I grew up  in western Colorado, and my mom and dad and all of their family was  from Arkansas. I moved to Arkansas and went to a little small liberal  arts college, Arkansas Tech in Russellville, Arkansas.  What did you major in?  I majored in about everything (Laughter) for quite a few years, but I  eventually ended up with a business communications degree.  Did you do graduate school?  Not right afterwards. My life is one of serendipity.  That  is a good way  to describe, I think, a lot of how circumstances have really guided my  life a lot and what has transpired in it. When I was in college   and I   ve  had real, what I consider, significant things in my life that have  happened that have forced me to do some serious evaluation of where I  was at and what I wanted to do. When I was in college, I spent several  years   and like a lot of kids, I didn   t know what I wanted to do, and you  kind of fumbled through a whole bunch of different things. I worked in a  7  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  pizza restaurant, a little place called King Pizza. A lot of kids put  themselves through college in food service. That   ll be a common theme  by the way. You   ll see the irony in all of that. But I worked there for  quite a few years and got to the point where I really didn   t know what I  wanted to do, and I had an opportunity. They wanted me to go manage  one of their pizza restaurants, so I did that for a couple of years.  My mother became ill with cancer during that time period. One of the  things she told me before she passed on was that she wanted me to finish  my college degree, and so I quit what I was doing and went back to  college and finished my undergraduate degree. Was very focused. I had  a purpose, knew what I wanted to do, and did that. So, I was a little bit  later in life, and there was always these kinds of one or two year kind of  breakouts that would happen that I would go do something different.  How long was that, Mitch, that time between when you left school the  first time and worked for the pizza company to when you went back?  About two years, a little over two years.  Did you go back to Arkansas Tech?  Yes, went back to Arkansas Tech. Matter of fact, went back to the pizza  restaurant that I worked at and said I wanted a job, but all I wanted to do  was wash dishes or make pizza. I didn   t want any responsibilities. I  wanted to focus. I needed to make some money, though, so that   s what I  did. I took just a baseline job and focused on my studies.  And then after that did you go on to graduate school?  No, after that I moved back to Colorado. Denver, Colorado. Went to  work for a company called Noble Sysco, however, I   ve got to be honest.  My first job out of college was in Boulder, Colorado, working for a  wealthy doctor, mucking barns. You know what mucking barns is. It   s  cleaning out the stalls that he had a bunch of really nice horses in, and I  would fix fence and muck out the barns. Then I would interview for jobs  in the afternoon. I was always afraid that I   d walk in with a little too  much odiferous about me. But that was my first job in Boulder, and then  I went to work for a food service provider called Noble Sysco. It   s a  very large vendor internationally. I worked for them for a couple of  years up in Steam Boat Springs, Colorado, then was recruited by  Kellogg   s Corporation. Kellogg   s had a whole line of product lines that  they sold to these food vendors, whether it be Sysco or Kraft or whoever  it was, institutional restaurants. And so Kellogg   s recruited me because I  sold a lot of their products in Noble Sysco. Moved to Phoenix, Arizona,  and had Arizona and Las Vegas as my territory and worked for  8  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Kellogg   s for about two years.  Then as an undergraduate in college, I was involved with the Student  Activities Board, Student Government, and Greek Life. I was heavily  involved, and it influenced me tremendously, which is why what I do  today was influenced by that. And so I got just kind of disenchanted, I  think, with that. I still remember telling my dad about how I was going  to quit a Fortune 500 company, (had a company car, and was going to go  to college, get more education, make less money) and him still trying to  figure out what I was doing on that, but that   s what I did. I quit my job  in Phoenix with Kellogg   s and moved to Emporia, Kansas, where I went  to graduate school at Emporia State University. Yes. And took that job  because it was in the student union, and that   s where I got really  immersed in all of that then. I   d had the activities and the programming  side, but I spent a lot more time then on the operational side.  Going back chronologically, so you graduated high school in      Nineteen eighty.  And then you went to Tech for a few years?  For a few years, and then I laid out for a couple years, and then I went  back. I graduated Tech in    87.  Eighty-seven. And this would   ve been about, what, three or four years  later?  Actually, it was only about three and a half years later by the time it was  all said and done. I went back to graduate   well, no. It was fall of    89,  so it was only two years.  Then you went back to Emporia State.  Yes.  And you graduated what year?  Nineteen ninety-one.  One of my questions was what influenced you to want to become a  student union director, and I think you were leading right into that. Can  you share some of that with us?  You   re influenced a lot of times in student affairs or student services;  you usually don   t know that you   re influenced until several years down  9  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  the road. A lot of the more powerful things that happened in my life I  can draw a direct line to being involved in a programming board or  running the lecture series or student government or in Greek Life. I can  attribute those qualities and what I learned directly back to all those. I  think after I   d left awhile, I looked back on that very positive experience  and called up my advisor, a gentleman by name of Jimmy Ferguson, and  talked to Jimmy and said you get in life where you don   t quite know  whether to go right or go left, and you have these inklings of what you  want to do. And he just asked me, well, what did I enjoy the most, and I  told him that, and he said,    Well, you may want to think about this.     And so I did. I packed up everything I owned and moved to Kansas and  never regretted it. It   s the best decision I ever made.  At Emporia State, were you working in Student Life? Was your master   s  in Student Development or something?  I was. My master   s is in higher ed administration, but I worked in the  student union as a GA and Greek Life, student activities, student  government, and then I did a lot of other things inside of that on the  operational side. One of the unique experiences that I had   and I was  older than a lot of the students. By the time I went to graduate school, I  was a couple of years older than that and had, I guess, a little bit more  worldly experience, had worked for a Fortune 500 food company, so I  had some other experiences. The director of the student union got into a  little bit of a tiff with the university, as sometimes happened, and he  moved on to another position in the university. So, the assistant director  of the union, who I reported to as a GA, took over as interim, and he  asked me my last six months as a graduate student to take over the  activities, so I was kind of a quasi-professional then and did that.  Interim Assistant Director.  Yes, and from there then I left Emporia State after I graduated and went  to Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas.  Do you have your doctorate in Administration?  No.  Just a master   s. Could you trace your career from leaving, after your  master   s program at Emporia to when you came to OSU?  From Emporia State, left there, went to Washburn University, was the  director of Student Activities and Greek Life. Once again, that was a  really good job because you did everything. You know, I advised student  government, IFC  Interfraternity Council  and Pan-Hellenic, the Student  10  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Programming Board, student publications. I think I cleaned bathrooms  and cooked part-time. It was one of those kinds of jobs where you did a  whole bunch of different things, but it was probably one of the greater  experiences that I had because I learned an awful lot from a whole bunch  of different people.  And this was at Washburn University in Kansas.  Yes, at Topeka, Kansas. So, I was there until    95 and had an opportunity  at that point to either pursue more of a Dean of Students track, which  you see a lot of times in the Student Affairs. People that are in Student  Activities and that area will pursue that. Or I could pursue more of the  operational side on the student union side. And since I had a fairly  strong food service background and a little bit of auxiliary kind of  business background, that seemed to be more of a path that I wanted to  go. I had an opportunity to go to UW-Oshkosh, Wisconsin, and become  their assistant director. I was hired to come in and to set up their  marketing department and their programming board, but I wanted the  operational opportunities to move forward. So, Oshkosh was a great job  for me. I got hired as kind of a lateral move for me, but I was there, and  within a year I got those things structured. They made me the associate  director of the union, and I started moving away from the activities and  moving more in towards the business services, ID cards and C-stores  and all of their auxiliary services, their meeting, conference and facility  management. Eventually the Food Service Director moved on, and so I  got that responsibility and title, so I was director of food service and  associate director of the union. So, then, I   d pretty much moved all into  auxiliaries there.  So, is there a story about how you got to OSU?  Yes. We have to go back to Emporia, though, to get to that story. When I  was a graduate student, professionally I belonged to Association of  College Unions International, which is my professional affiliation. I  belong to a couple others, but that   s the primary one. And they have  regional conferences. So, Emporia   s not that far from Stillwater, and  OSU and Emporia are all in the same ACU regional grouping. When I  was a graduate student, ACU Regional was held here, and so I came  here and got to meet Dr.  Thomas M.  Keys. I   ve asked Tom about that.  I said,    You know, I could probably come up and kick you in the knee,  and you wouldn   t remember me.    (Laughs) And he didn   t. But I came  here and was very influenced once again by the campus, the significance  of this union and what it is and how it was operated, how Dr. Keys  operated it and ran it. I said at that point in time that I would love to  work there, that would be a great opportunity. I never dreamed I   d be the  director, but that was one of my top jobs that if I ever had the  11  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  opportunity. So, years later, when the job came open, I applied for it just  thinking,    I   ll throw my hat in the ring to see, throw it out.    I got the  opportunity. It was a dream job for me to come here and to work at this  campus and work at this student union.  You were at Oshkosh at that time?  No, I was at Eau Claire. I   d left Oshkosh. I was there for seven years,  and then I   d gone to UW-Eau Claire because I was associate director of  the union, director of their Dining Auxiliary Operations, and Eau Claire  had a director of student union position, so I moved to Eau Claire.  As director of the student union?  Yes, Student Services, their Student Center System.  You talked a little bit about how you liked some things you saw at  Oklahoma State University. What attracted you primarily to the position  when you were a serious candidate?  If you go back and you look at, kind of, the history of student unions as  just a general model   I hate to tell anybody this, but we stole the union  idea from across the pond in England where unions were developed over  there at Cambridge and Oxford around the whole idea of debating  societies. And when they brought that state-side, then they really started  morphing into these kind of businesses and these really kind of  collaborative ventures on a whole bunch of different fronts. The  traditional student union model had a very strong business component,  but it also had a very strong student life and campus life component.  One of the predecessor union directors that worked here, Winston  G.   Shindell at IU  Indiana University  used to say,    I make the money over  here, and they spend it over there,    and that   s kind of what attracted me  a little bit. My passion and love has always been in campus life. I have a  pretty good business sense, and I like the operational auxiliary side, and  this allowed me to do all of that. There are not that many unions  anymore that do that. A lot of them have been broken up into pieces  where they   re either a business auxiliary and they no longer have the  campus life element, or they   re all campus life and they no longer have  the business element. So, to have both of those is an ideal union job.  Then to encapsulate all of that into the largest student union, then to put  that on a beautiful campus in Stillwater, Oklahoma, you can   t ask for  anything better. This is a dream job.  Can you share briefly with us, Mitch, your philosophy of what a student  union should be?  12  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Sure.  Generally, not  just the  OSU Student Union.  The student union exists for one purpose and that   s to support academic  success of students on campus. We do that through our programs and  services that we offer, but our core mission of what we do is to support  student success on campus. And so a student union is that kind of unique  place on campus that you really can   t pinpoint and hold them down and  say,    Well, they do this.    We do a whole bunch of different things on  them. The trick of it is to do it in unison and to do it well and then to  support academic success of our students. But, ultimately, a student  union is that home away from home, a place that students can go and  either find things that they need or to engage in out-of-classroom  experiences, to socialize. Dr.  Henry G.  Bennett on this campus laid out  the vision in 1937 for our student union, and he envisioned a place that  would influence the social, cultural and academic environment on  campus, and it took shape in that building. I feel very strongly that that   s  our purpose today. Now we   re doing it and need to do it differently than  how it   s done historically, but those core elements are still at our roots  and who we are and what we   re about.  Well, specifically, what is the mission of the OSU Student Union?  The mission of the OSU Student Union is to provide students the  programs and services they need to succeed academically on campus  and to make sure that they have at their disposal those tools and  resources that will benefit them while they   re here, but also long after  they leave campus. We know that when students get involved in Campus  Life and get involved in Greek or student government or whatever, that  that has a significant impact just like it did on me, that years down the  road, a lot of the skills, a lot of the things that they did and learned will  benefit them. So, a core piece of our mission is to make sure that we  support that, both financially, programmatically, and through being very  intentional about it.  Mitch, when you first came, what strengths did you identify of the OSU  Student Union that you wanted to build on?  First of all, you know, it was a little intimidating coming here. Dr. Keys  is a not only an icon in the profession. People in my profession knew of  him, looked at him. I was always that guy that you always wanted to be  the guy in that went   the last guy that left out was the guy that did the  worst job because you   d look like a genius coming in next. So, I was a  little intimidated coming in following Dr. Keys and what he had done  for this campus.  13  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  And the one preceding him.  Yes, the one preceding him was Winston Shindell.  He  is another one  who is an icon. So, I   m following a sequence of some pretty big shoes in  those two gentlemen alone. To come here, though, and when I looked at  it, what I saw was a very well run organization that had been very  resourceful and had some very talented people in their jobs. Early on,  you asked me about things that I learned growing up. One of the things I  learned from Dad, who was a superintendent of a coal mine,  is  it   s not  always about you. It   s about the people that are around you. You don   t  have to be the smartest guy in the room; you just have to be smart  enough to let the other people do their jobs. And that was one of the real  benefits when I came is I inherited a very rich staff, very knowledgeable,  very capable people. We were able to develop a cohesion and work as a  unit together and have progressed, I think, the student union forward in a  very progressive way. We   re sitting on the brink of a major renovation  of the student union four years after I   ve been here. I   m very proud of  that, but it wasn   t just me. There   s a whole group of people and students  included that have allowed us to do that. So, to answer your question, I  think the real strengths and benefits of what I got was a very well run  organization with quality people.  You came in 2005?  Yes.  At that time, what challenges and opportunities did you perceive?  When I got here, my intentions were to kind of let the waters run by  because you had an organization that worked and functioned, but you  could also tell that the building was tired and was in need of a  renovation. We needed to progress structurally and operationally in a  very progressive way if we were going to maintain one of our great  attributes, which is that we   re pure auxiliary. We generate all of our own  revenue. And that   s another real key element about why this is a very  great union to work at is there   s not very many of them left that generate  the revenue that this one generates that goes right back into its operation.  A lot of them are subsidized now significantly, and so if we were going  to maintain that historical value of being a really good auxiliary, we  needed kind of the boat to do it with, and the union was in need of some  significant improvements to do that. So, that was, I think, one of the key  challenges that I walked into. I think culturally within the organization  there were some real challenges on how we needed to start changing our  culture to be a little bit more service oriented, particularly with the  students and the millennials and what their expectations are, and we  needed to start really lining that up and be a lot more service oriented.  14  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Are there some priorities and goals that you established early on that  you have for the student union? I know the main is improving  fundraising, but generally what are some of your primary goals that you  set, more general, overarching kind of goals?  I always look at we   re a player in the university mission. And so early  on we looked at,    Okay, what role is it that we play in supporting the  university mission?    Because if the university   s not here, we   re not here.  So, we needed to look at what the priorities and the goals were for the  university. Then we came back and looked at that and said,    Okay, this  is where we need to plug into that.    We did some general gap analysis  and said,    Okay, these are our strengths; these are our weaknesses. In  order for us to really contribute to the university, we need to do these  things.    Really what it came down to was we really needed to do some  operational things relative to the building to reposition it so we could  better serve the greater need of the campus long-term. So, it seemed that  was a major goal of ours was to evaluate every aspect physically of the  building to look at what we need to do so we could programmatically  deliver services in a better format than what we currently have. So, that  was a primary goal.  I think our other one was to maintain a core mission of ours, which is to  keep the cost of education low to students. One of the things I   m very  proud about is our bookstore. It runs as a privately-ran bookstore and  runs some of the best financials of any bookstore in the nation. Some  numbers, but most university self-operated bookstores, about 28 percent  of the textbooks they sell are used. Ours are 43 percent, which is a real  benefit to our students because that   s one of our key things is to keep  that cost low to students. And so we really have a very well run, very  efficient operation, but we haven   t raised our rates significantly in  almost thirty years on our margins. We   ve been able to do that by just  growing the business and being smart about our investments and how we  do those things.  What do you see as being your primary responsibility as director of the  union?  I used to say to not mess up the history of my predecessors Winston and  Dr. Keys and the people that have come before me because they   ve done  such a great job of making this a signature operation not only for the  campus but nationally. But my primary day-to-day responsibilities are  administrative in nature: budget, fiscal management, personnel,  operational, and working in those. A lot of my time right now is spent on  the building project and fundraising and doing those things, which are  two things I enjoy an awful lot as well.  15  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Mitch, you   ve talked about students a lot. Are there other primary  stakeholders in the student union? Could you identify some of those for  us?  Yes. The student union is that one place that we often say it   s kind of the  life cycle of the student union and particularly on this campus because of  the student service facility, the hotel and other things, which are part of  our union. It   s the first place that most students come to, and it   s the last  place they go when they graduate. So, it   s usually the first time when  they come to campus, whether it be for a campus visit or orientation, but  it   s also the last place they come to get their cap and gown before they  graduate, and then they come back through our doors as alumni on  Homecoming and other days. So, our constituency is current students,  future students, past students, alumni, city, community, state. We have a  lot, a lot, of stakeholders. Faculty. So, all of our constituencies use our  facility and use it heavily.  Well, that sort of leads into our next question. What are the major  operational units in the student union? How are they organized and  managed?  The union   I have several direct reports. I have three assistant directors.  I have an assistant director of Retail Business Operations, Lance Hinkle,  who oversees the bookstore and then all of our retail spaces. We lease  those out in the building, so he oversees that. I have an assistant director  of Operations,  Mounzer  Manny Al-Harake, and Manny oversees  custodial. We have our own maintenance crews and mechanics and  carpenters. It   s a 611,000 square-foot facility, so we break a lot of things  and have got to maintain them and keep them operational. I have an  assistant director of Administrative Services. We   re, right now, just the  union side of things, we   re about a  20 million a year enterprise, so,  therefore, we have a lot of HR and Marketing and IT and Accounts  Receivable and Accounts Payable, all of those elements. I have Meeting  Conference Services as a direct report. Then, as of last year   we   ve  always had Dining as part of the union in our own operations, but now  all of Dining reports to me, campus wide. That   s the irony of food  service: I left it only to get it all back again later in life. (Laughs)  We   re talking about in the residence halls as well as catering.  Yes, everything campus wide. All of dining now reports, it reports back  to Terry Baker, who   s the director of Dining, and then Terry reports to  me. Then Campus Life reports back to the student union. Kent  Sampson   s my associate director and also director of Campus Life, and  that reports back through my operation as well.  16  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  So, Kent reports to you as opposed to through Vice President of Student  Affairs?  That   s correct.  You talked about being a  20 million a year operation. What are the  primary funding sources for the student union? What are your revenue  streams?  The bookstore is our primary one. The union itself is about a  20 million  a year enterprise. Food service is another  15 million, so budgetarily, I  have a responsibility for about  35 million annually. On the student  union side of things, the bookstore makes up about 85 percent of our  operational budget, and that   s a really good thing that we generate that  money. It goes right back into our operation and allows us to keep fees  and other things low from passing on to students. So, it funds a lot of  Campus Life. It funds a lot of other activities and events on campus. Ten  percent comes from student fees, and those fees are attributed to bonds  that we   ve had for either historical building projects or initiatives. Then  5 percent comes from rental space. We have a lot of lease spaces in the  building, both private retail as well as offices that are housed in the  union that pay. So, all together, the biggest contributor to that, though, is  the bookstore. Food Service contributes as well, but most of the food  service dollars go back into food service to maintain its campus-wide  operations.  Have the roles and functions of the student union changed over the years  at OSU?  I don   t know that the roles have changed. I think how we achieve our  goals and our mission has maybe changed. One of the interesting things  if you   re a student of student unions is that they   ve been on the cutting  front of a lot of new things that happen on college campuses pretty  consistently. Historically, we were developed around the idea of the  debating societies, and then they added in these business enterprises on  top of those. So, then, during the    50s and    60s you kind of see the  growth of a lot of auxiliary business enterprises and recreational types of  elements inside a student union develop. Then, the latter part of the    60s  and early    70s you start seeing a lot of the entertainment and student  government, self-government, aspects of higher education happening,  particularly in the late    60s when you had a lot of the student  governments become very radicalized because of the Vietnam  movement and demanded a role at the table with the university as far as  a shared governance structure. Then you started moving into the    80s,  and you started seeing technology with ID card systems and computers,  and, once again, student unions led a lot of those, were at the front of  17  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  those new technologies and implementing a lot of those. So, we stand  now, I think, on the next bridge of looking with those next set of  technologies, the next kind of forefront of what we   re going to be doing  because things have changed dramatically again in how we operate and  how we deliver our services.  You mentioned that OSU   s been on the cutting edge of a lot of things.  How is the OSU Student Union perceived in your national organization?  It   s considered one of the premiere student unions nationally. The OSU  Student Union has also been on the cutting front of a lot of new  innovative ideas. It was the first union that implemented a mall-type of  food court. Prior to that, you had kind of dining halls, and you didn   t  have a lot of retail-type of spaces. It was the first one that incorporated  the mall kind of concept that you had shops and various things that  people would go to. Student union, also funding-wise, it was the first  one that was ever funded with no taxpayers    dollars. It was bonds that  were raised with the student fees, so we were the first one to do that.  That   s pretty commonly how things get done today, but back in 1948  when that happened, we were the first ones to do that.  Trying to move forward, look maybe ten, twenty years down the road,  what do you see? How do you think the OSU Student Union will evolve  and change in the future?  That   s hard to say because the future   s so fluid. What I hope will happen  is that we will continue our role of providing services and programs that  benefit students and the campus. How we do that is going to change  pretty dramatically. I think technology is obviously going to influence  that dramatically. Where you go from the late    80s, where everybody   s  walking around with a Walkman, to today with the iPods, so technology  obviously is an influence on a lot of what we do and how we do things. I  think that we   re going to have to be more value-added in our services. I  think education is at a point where the support of public institutions has  diminished as far as what kind of money comes in, and so people are  really looking at those educational opportunities that I would consider  value-added, that when they come that they   re getting a true value. I  think we have to be very conscientious about our role and what we do  inside of that.  I think our traditional role of providing that kind of home away from  home for students is as critical as it   s ever been. Students on campuses  with all the technology have kind of dissipated to their own individual  corners, and they don   t socialize or engage or interact as much as they  used to. I think we have a real role to try to help and play that because I  think we know significantly the value of community building and what  18  Gill  Kilcrease  that means to the college and what it means to students. Technology,  once again, I think, will play a critical role in all of that. I think the  future of the student union is still an awful lot about Campus Life. I  mean, Dr. Bennett   s vision almost sixty years ago, or longer than that,  but the student union is almost sixty years old here on campus. But his  vision for the student union is as relevant today as it was back then. We  still need to influence socially, culturally, and academically what  happens on a campus. We may do that passively through art or activities  or events or whatever, the services we offer, but what he laid out is still  relevant sixty years later. It   s just a different way of doing it.  You identified, earlier, students as primary stakeholders. Can you tell  me a little bit about student programming and activities and services at  the student union?  Yes, the student union does a lot of different programs and activities.  SUAB, Student Union Activities Board, has been there since the doors  opened in 1951, have been a critical part of our operation and is a  mainstay of what we do. Whether it   s the movies they offer or bands or  entertainment, even they are evolving and changing dramatically. We  now have the Xbox and all of that. We have those kind of games and  activities that are going on, but, once again, their core mission is still the  same: to build community around the student union and to provide  engagement opportunities for individuals.  Campus Life is probably one of our greatest assets. When I sat down and  did evaluation preparing for our building project, I asked people three  things: What is it we do well, what should we do better, and where  should I spend my resources and time? In essence, what I heard back  from them is Campus Life was our greatest asset, and Kent Sampson has  done a fabulous job with developing that program, and it   s a model for a  lot of other campuses to look at. We   re trying to take that model and  actually do something significantly different than what has been done in  the past. Most campus activities, Campus Life departments, are built  around like Student Government and Programming, Greek Life, and  then Student Organization. Kent has the added responsibilities of  International Student Services as a part of that, Volunteer Services,  Parents    Association, so we built this kind of nexus of activity around  Campus Life. The unfortunate part is we have them in the basement, so  we   re trying to rectify that in our building project and get them in a very  high-profile way. But we think we have another role to play in all of  that, that if we can put them in a very prominent, high-profile area,  surround them with some other key offices, whether it be the Office of  Diversity of Inclusion or Multicultural Services on campus, Study  Abroad program, which is a key element of what the university is trying  to do with getting students to have an experience in another country as  19  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  part of their college activities, we think by positioning all of that  together in a very high-profile way, that with a little social engineering,  that we can influence a lot of students pretty positively. So, that   s a real  critical part we   re trying to achieve right now.  They go from students to former students, alumni.  That   s right.  And why do you think our alumni have such positive feelings about the  student union?  It can   t be that they had to pay their bill at the bursar. It can   t be that  they had to buy their books. I think what it attributes to, and what I  attribute it to, is it   s their home away from home. It   s where they have  memories of where they met somebody. It   s a significant event in their  life, whether it be through Campus Life and all the various programs and  services that are offered in there   sometimes it   s just as silly as eating in  a restaurant, the same restaurant, during their college and their  engagement, but ultimately it   s all of those things kind of wrapped up  into one. We talk about the building and say people look at that steeple  on campus and it emotes a tremendous amount of different emotions and  people feel very, very strongly about it when they see that. You have got  to ask yourself,    Is it about the building, or is it about what   s inside of  the building?    Really, it   s kind of the house and home theory. The union  is the house, but really what happens inside is what makes it a home. I  think that   s what draws people to those is the notion of home, friends,  family, colleagues. It all comes together around lunch or just hanging  out or going to an event or activity. I think that   s what drives a lot of it.  You are amazed at the stories that you hear. I think you call them  student union memories that people have?  Yes.  They   re very passionate about them, aren   t they?  Yes. The one thing that this union has done a tremendous job doing is  documenting its history. We   ve got just tons and tons of photos, and I  hear from people all the time. They tell me about a significant event.  Maybe it was going to a Howdy Dance, and that   s where they met their  significant other, or it was about how the   and I haven   t been able to  ascertain on whether this is an urban myth or reality, about a bull in the  elevator going up to the fourth floor. I have names, and I will not  divulge that at this point in time, but as I understand it, at some point  there was a cow put in the elevator and taken to the fourth floor of the  20  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  student union and let loose. People just have very, very fond memories  around it. The Ballroom, activities, events, the lounges.  Starlight Terrace.  Yes, Starlight Terrace.  Used to be the old Big Eight room.  That   s right, and people see it or hear it, and it just immediately takes  them to a place and time that they have some of the most wonderful  experiences of their life, and they attribute it to that building.  And you mentioned two things: the icon and the tower of the library, too.  It   s really an icon.  It is an icon.  And immediately, then, it brings back certain memories and images.  Another thing is, for years and years, the byline was    the heart of the  campus.    The student union was the heart of the campus.  Yes.  I guess that   s probably the philosophy you   re talking about to students,  being the heart of the campus to them.  Yes, the students, people always ask me,    Does it have the right name?     I say,    Yes, the student union.    I mean, students paid for that building  through books, burgers, and fees. One way or another, they   ve paid for  that building, but they also use it. 1.5 million people a year go through  that building. A million five. We   ve got counters on the doors, so we  track them in that. They come there for a whole variety of different  reasons, but students really take ownership of that building. And on our  building project, we involve students heavily in what we   re doing right  now. Students have kept me very mindful about what we do to the  building and how we do it, because how people look at it and how they  see it is definitely tied to the psyche of our alumni. So, we want to make  sure that we maintain that history and that tradition. Now, if you look at  what we have branded our building projects, it   s called,    Building on  Traditions,    because that   s very much what we feel very strongly about  is what worked well. When the doors opened in 1951, those traditions  and those values are still relevant today, and we   re really embracing  those. Now, we may deliver services and programs differently, but that   s  the values that we   re embracing.  21  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Well, Mitch, maybe you were going that way. Maybe we can just follow  that question. Can you tell us a little about the plans for renovating the  student union and the fundraising campaign that you have with that?  Yes. When I started here, I told you early on, I wanted to let the water  kind of run by. I got here, and we heard a lot of people were very  interested in us moving forward with the building project. They felt it  was time that we needed to do that. So, we moved a little faster than  what I thought we were going to be ready to do, and we put together a  group of students and staff, and we evaluated unions around the United  States and studied our union and came up with a series of initiatives and  priorities that we need to address in a renovation. We   ve spent the last  three years developing that and have come up with a program and a  project that is about an  80 million project in scope, and we have funded  it to date at  53 million. We   ll actually start some construction later this  fall. We   re trying to do the remaining fundraising for that, between the   53 and the  80 million dollars, to complete the full scope of the  building project. I often tell people that when you manage the world   s  largest student union, you get the largest bills to fix it. So, it   s not a  cheap endeavor, but, once again, I think it   s such a significant element of  the campus that we really need to be mindful about what we do. We  have involved faculty, staff, alumni, everybody in this process to make  sure that we   re on target.  Could you share some major conceptual changes that you   re going to  have as part of that maintenance and upgrade?  Two different things. One of them is good news/bad news type of things.  I talked early on about the quality of the staff and their abilities. One of  the true benefits of having a really talented staff is they have done a  tremendous job of maintaining that building operationally long past its  life cycle on a lot of the mechanical systems. We have systems in the  1951 building that are close to sixty years of age, so we have to go back  and do some significant infrastructure, mechanical upgrades. I   ve often  told them,    Well, we may have been better off to let something fail at  some point, and maybe we would   ve got it done a little bit sooner.    But  they take a lot of pride in making sure things function, and I   m very  happy and pleased with that as well. So, we   ve got to go fix all of those  things. Infrastructure, mechanical systems, all of that has to get done.  It   s very costly to operate and maintain that building, and there   s a lot of  efficiencies by investing in that.  Secondly, we want to continue with maintaining our history of having a  strong economic engine via our bookstore and food service operations so  we can maintain that history of generating revenue and putting it back  into our operation so that we   re not unduly passing on fees and other  22  Gill  things to students that are unnecessary, that we take that money and  reinvest it back to the students. In order for us to do that, we have to  bring our food service and our bookstore and our retail operations up to  snuff a little bit. So, those are kind of the two big key elements that  we   re doing.  Then the third thing that we   re really focusing on is to give back those  spaces and enhance and improve student spaces. We want to get Campus  Life out of the basement and get them on the second floor and put them  in probably some of the best spaces in the whole building for a couple of  reasons. One is we want to make a statement about how we feel about  students, and this is their building. Number two is we want to be very  purposeful in what we   re doing with our greatest asset and try to  leverage that a little bit more to help be a greater benefit to the campus  academic missions through our out-of-classroom experiences and our  programs and services that we have. We think we can do that by some  significant improvements there. Then, we   re planning on upgrading the  rest of the building, offices and meeting rooms.  Probably one of the most exciting parts about it is the north plaza on the  north side of the building. I said earlier that 1.5 million people enter our  doors annually. About 70 percent of them enter the northwest corner,  that smallest area between the library and our C-store on the northwest  corner by the Chi-O Clock. And so what has happened on campus, if  you were to look at it, you have the academic core on the northwest  corner where the library is and the campus quad, and then you have the  athletic core, which is being built with the stadium, and then all of the  new academic development happening up Hester Street. That north  plane of the building becomes a critical element about how people  engage our building, so we   re going to put a plaza out where the Chi-O  Clock is. Chi-O Clock will stay there. It   s a signature item for us, but  we   re going to really enhance that space and make some really great  outdoor space out there. We   re also going to take the original back side  of the student union that faced Old Central and would   ve been the  terrace and we   re taking   that   s covered up now by the Student Service  and the Atrium, but we   re going to take that look and feel of the back  side of the union, and that   s what   s going to come out on the front side  of the north side. That   s going to be our new entry point and portal. So,  we   re going back and taking something historical that has been lost and  are bringing it back as a signature piece. We   ll have a new terrace just  like we did in the Starlight Terrace that   ll overlook the plaza, and our  meeting rooms will come out of that. Very exciting.  Thank you. You mentioned earlier Dr. Bennett, President Bennett, and  his dream, his vision. How important was the student union in his vision  for the university?  23  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  I think it was critical. He was very visionary. The Master Plan was laid  out in 1937. The student union movement was already in the United  States, but it was fairly new and growing at that point in time, and he  latched onto that and saw that as a significant element of what would  really truly help improve the quality of life for students on campus. And  not just for students, but for everybody. He really saw this building as  what it is today.  It  is this significant iconic building that everybody,  campus alumni, students, faculty, staff gather around, and he saw that it  would have purpose and meaning it has and will continue to have.  Can you share some of your memorable experiences as director of the  student union over the last five years?  I hate to keep on going back to the building project, but that   s been such  a significant part of ours. Early on, I decided that I wanted students  heavily engaged in this process, so when we sat down and developed our  design team and our development team, we put the same number of  students as staff on that design team. I also then took the student body  president and made them co-chair, had the same authority that I did. It  went back to something that I   ve known for a long time in my  profession, that a well educated student about the facts and reality of  what you   re trying to accomplish and get done is a lethal tool to have,  because they will take what needs to happen and will understand it and  can move an agenda forward ahead of times, a lot of times where I  cannot. We opened our doors and our books and everything. I can set a  student that sat on that design team in this chair, and they can tell you  everything that I know about the building project because they have  been that engaged in it. So, that   s one of my great memories is how they  have influenced what we   re doing towards the future, and I   m proud  because that really says a lot about who we are as an organization. We  are the student union. They should be involved with what we   re doing,  and they have been and will continue to be.  Mitch, you sound like you probably answered a question ahead of mine  which is what accomplishments in the student union are you most proud  of in your tenure here?  Probably the renovation will be one of them, I think, being able to  improve the services and maintain the quality of expectation that I think  people have of that facility. I think we work very hard every day to make  sure that we represent the campus in our little piece of what we can do.  But our staff takes a lot of pride in the fact that we play a small part in a  very big role of the campus, and we want to make sure that we support  that.  What have been the traditions and legacies of the student union through  24  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  the years? What things would you historically look at as the traditions of  the student union?  Well, we   ve played a lot of different roles. Obviously Homecoming.  Greek Life is a significant part. A lot of it goes back to Campus Life,  Follies, Howdy Week, Alpha, Enrollment, Orientation. Recently I think  we   ve played a really significant role in the orientation and the  recruitment effort of the university. I hope to continue to play a larger  role in all of that. Obviously, just the day-to-day life of students getting  something to eat and going to hang out and playing pool or seeing their  friends.  Bowling used to be.  Bowling. You mentioned that. When I was out doing all of our research,  that was probably the one or two top-three things when I talked to  people my age or older. They would always ask me,    When you   re  doing the renovation project, are you going to put the bowling alley back  in again?    That always is raised. Love to. Very expensive to do so.  Square foot.  Yes, very big.  Mitch, kind of a speculative kind of question for you. Looking back, fast  forward and then look back on your tenure as you step down as director  hopefully in several years from now. How do you hope people will  remember you?  That   s an interesting question. I haven   t thought about that, Jerry. The  obvious question is,    What have you heard?    (Laughter) I think what I  would hopefully be remembered by   I always have said this about my  job. I said,    I always wanted to be that guy on campus that when the  President or somebody walks by, go  lt;snap gt;    I recognize the face. I can   t  put a name to it.       That   s always who I   ve wanted to be. I   m more  comfortable in that guy that makes sure things get done and happen. I  don   t feel an overwhelming need to be in front of something. I like that  role of being behind the scenes on it. I hope that I   m remembered as  somebody that worked really hard, had the best interests of students in  mind and worked hard to progress the mission of the university through  whatever role that I had to play in all of that.  Maybe a final question for you. Have we fulfilled Henry G. Bennett   s  dream of what he wanted the student union to be?  Oh yes. Yes, I think we   ve four-fold on it, and I talk about this a lot  25  Gill  Kilcrease  when I go out and talk on fundraising. I beckon back to his time, and I  often reference what he says and talk about what his vision was there.  Because I truly in my heart of heart believe that what he believed in  there is as relevant today as it was back then, and I don   t think we   re  able to, under our current constraints of how the facility is structured,  how it operates, and because we have to do some real physical things to  improve upon it, I don   t think that we   re able to deliver the programs  and service at the same level that they were sixty years ago. And we  need to go back to that and re-elevate that because I think that the  facility has the capacity to continue his dream and vision, and that   s kind  of my mission is to make sure that we do that.  You   ve probably given this, I   ll say,    pitch,    maybe. Mitch, why should  someone give to the student union project? Why should somebody make  a major gift to it?  A couple different things. One of the unique things when we went  through the process with our students and we talked to them about, you  know, students decided to give themselves, charge themselves a fee, a  new fee. We didn   t get to just put that on them. They made a decision to  fund a fee for this building project. And the way that this worked out,  they said,    You know, Mitch, we can   t over-leverage our future of the  students,    and I love that about Oklahoma State. It   s a very pragmatic  state. They can see the vision, but they   re also very pragmatic of  students and staff and faculty that have lived here and worked here their  whole life, understand that we have done well because we have managed  our resources very well. When the students decided to charge themselves  a fee, they couldn   t charge on the full amount of what we needed to do  to build the building, but they could meet me halfway. So, they said,     We   ll do this if you   ll go out and do an active fundraising part of all of  that.     The students that were involved in that process had the opportunity.  Some faculty asked them, independently of me being there,    Why  should students in the future give money to something that they   re never  going to benefit from?    And a student walked in and said,    Because  somebody had done it for them.    So, they got it. They got the idea of the  legacy of moving it forward. I think why people should give to this  building project is it is probably one of the single facilities on campus  that will benefit every student on campus both now, into the future, and  into the past. Faculty, staff   I mean, our constituency is very broad-based,  and an investment in the student union, I think, touches a lot of  people. So, if you look at that pragmatic approach that Oklahomans  have, you get a bang for buck for some of this, too. It will touch a lot of  lives in a very, very positive way. But more importantly than that, I  think it will continue the legacy that was left when Dr. Bennett put  26  Gill  Kilcrease  Gill  Kilcrease  down, of how it   s going to continue to help students progress during  their college time here long beyond their graduation.  I appreciate it, Mitch. Thank you so much for spending time with us  today.  No problem.  I appreciate your passion for the student union.  Love to do that.  -------  -------
