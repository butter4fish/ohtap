Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell: All right, this is Cynthia Greenlee-Donnell talking with D&#225;zon Dixon Diallo, who is the founder and CEO of SisterLove in Atlanta, and it is Friday, August 19, 2011. I want to start off, D&#225;zon, by asking you&#8212;. I know you grew up in Georgia, but where did you grow up?        D&#225;zon Dixon Diallo: I was born and raised in Fort Valley, Georgia, which is the county seat of Peach County, smallest, youngest county, in the middle of the state.        CGD: What did your family do for a living?        DDD: Both of my parents are educators. They&#8217;re both in the same field, and my father is a retired professor/administrator/chair/advisor of the science department at Fort Valley State, what is now Fort Valley State University. He was there for&#8212;forty years? Something, like that. And my mom, because they were in the same discipline, couldn&#8217;t teach at Fort Valley State so she ended up in the public school system, teaching life science and biology and all of that in high school, junior high. She was a school administrator and became a principal and is now on the school board.        CGD: Did you go to the same schools your mother worked in?        DDD: I sure did. My mama was my teacher and my sister&#8217;s teacher and my brother&#8217;s teacher, because we are a small town and we only had one school in the whole city, so if you made it through the eighth grade you went to Virginia J. Dixon.        CGD: And how far is that from Atlanta?        DDD: A hundred miles south. It&#8217;s about twenty-five miles south and west of Macon.        CGD: And so what was life like there for you as a child?        DDD: That&#8217;s a good question. Nobody&#8217;s asked me, what was life like in Fort Valley. So, typical &#8217;60s small, Southern, Georgia town, segregated. I mean I was born in the mid &#8217;60s, right, grew up for a little while in Stillwater, Oklahoma, because that&#8217;s where my daddy finished his PhD at Oklahoma State University. But giving you an example, when I came back, or when we came back and I started grade school, let&#8217;s just put it to you this way. My graduating high school class, and I finished a year early, but my graduating high school class was the first class to graduate fully integrated from K through twelve, so that gives you an idea. [Laughs] Things that I&#8217;m learning now that I didn&#8217;t even realize I wasn&#8217;t aware of are things like the public pool still wasn&#8217;t available to us. There are reasons why there are still no social activities or businesses in Fort Valley, no movie theaters, no skating rinks, no places where young people hang out, nothing except the parking lot of the fast food restaurant.         So I mean it was very much the typical small, segregated, but it was a black college town, so there was a different sense of the mixed income experience, so to speak, because you had a very strong black middle class, mostly because of the university, or the college at the time. We also were only about twenty minutes from one of the biggest air force bases in the South [Robins Air Force Base], and so you had a lot of military folks who worked in Warner Robins [town located in both Houston and Peach Counties], so it was interesting.         I grew up about two blocks from the campus, mostly on the campus, which again is a little bit of a different experience because you grow up in an academic, scholarly household and you spend most of your time on somebody&#8217;s campus, whether it was on public school or university campus. Then when I was thirteen we moved out to the country, literally, and I was thinking Fort Valley is already the country, so why are we moving further out as I&#8217;m going to high school, right? So anyway, there were fewer opportunities for integrated activities, socially or otherwise, but in school you didn&#8217;t have any choice because everybody, except the rich white kids who had the option to go to private school, everybody went to the same school. So that was a different time.        CGD: So if you had school activities were there just activities that the black children gravitated to and white children gravitated to?        DDD: Well I mean when it came to actual school activities, no. The band was integrated. The high school was integrated in terms of the sports. In some respects, because we also&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know how it is now but the way I saw it when I was in high school at least&#8212;it&#8217;s harder to remember grade school&#8212;when I was in high school the literary competitors, or literary athletes is what they used to call us, the literary competitors had not quite as much as juice as the football and basketball and baseball, but they did treat us just as well as they treated the sports athletes, but that was probably less integrated because they&#8217;re just, you know, it was more about debate and public speaking and writing and essay writing and all of that kind of stuff, and that&#8217;s the end that I participated in.        CGD: Okay, but you were a literary athlete.        DDD: I was a literary athlete. I was not a physical athlete whatsoever. I actually joined band so I didn&#8217;t have to take PE. [Laughs]        CGD: That qualified to get you out?        DDD: Yeah, because you had to run and walk and you had to exercise for band so they counted it. So, that was typical school activities, but you still had segregated lunchroom, right. The black kids sat on one side, the white kids sat on another.        CGD: But not because there was any physical effort&#8212;.        DDD: No, no, no, it was just that&#8217;s the gravitation of it. You still had no&#8212;. I&#8217;ll tell you what, issues, for example, you had separated proms because the school didn&#8217;t sponsor any of the school dances, parents did, and so white parents chose to throw white kids a prom and black kids&#8217; parents threw them a prom. In school, however, I guess what was supposed to look like it was egalitarian, we always had four class representatives for every class, one white guy, one black guy, one white girl, one black girl, and you got to vote amongst those populations so that they never competed with each other, and we had two separate homecoming queens. You would vote for one black homecoming queen and one white homecoming queen, so they would never have to compete. That went on until 1988/&#8217;89.        CGD: And was there a lot of controversy about ending the policy?        DDD: Yeah. I wasn&#8217;t there though. That was in my sister&#8217;s time. I was already out of college by the time that happened. But yeah, there was, but it was the adults that had the angst. The kids weren&#8217;t&#8212;. It was a nonplus for them.        CGD: So you left Fort Valley to go to Spelman.        DDD: Mm hmm. I left Fort Valley in &#8217;82 to attend Spelman College.         CGD: And why Spelman?        DDD: Why Spelman? One, my mother had always talked about Spelman because she had always wanted to go and couldn&#8217;t afford it as a young black girl coming from the projects in West Palm Beach, and she landed at Fort Valley State, which is cool because that&#8217;s where she met my dad and it&#8217;s all good. So I knew that&#8217;s where she always wanted to go. My dad is from Atlanta and&#8212;. Well, his family moved to Atlanta in the &#8217;50s. He&#8217;s really from central-east Georgia, Milledgeville, Sandersville area. So coming to Atlanta on a regular basis to see my grandparents and my aunts and uncles and cousins there was always exposure to the AU Center. My parents were very much supportive of historically black colleges, universities. They&#8217;re also booster buffs so wherever the football teams went we went, so we went to lots of football games. So I grew up knowing a lot of these folks that were college students and had spent some time on Spelman&#8217;s campus and just fell in love with the notion. I don&#8217;t even know where the drive to go, but I was determined that I wanted to go to the all black women&#8217;s school.        CGD: You only had two.        DDD: Because I only had two, right. It was one of those things where if I couldn&#8217;t go far, far, far away then I was going to not go too far, so it was either the University of Hawaii or&#8212;. No, [Laughs] I&#8217;m just saying. There was a list of options and as a matter of fact at that time, truly, because Brown was on my list and Carleton College, which I cannot imagine because I just couldn&#8217;t see myself going to school in Minnesota, and a couple other schools were my options, and oddly enough Spelman came with the most money in scholarship so that&#8217;s where I went. So it&#8217;s a combination of that&#8217;s where I really wanted to go and then they came with the most scholarship money, and so that&#8217;s where I went.        CGD: And so was it at Spelman that you started working on health issues?        DDD: Yeah, actually it was, but it wasn&#8217;t working on health issues; it was more working in activist issues. I actually arrived at Spelman in &#8217;82 during the time when the anti-apartheid movement on black college campuses was really reaching a certain momentum, so I got involved in that my first year in college. Not only that, at the end of my first year in college I was working on campus, because I also got involved in a lot of campus stuff and campus promotion stuff and helped found what became the&#8212;I can&#8217;t remember what it was now. It was the admissions, Spelman student admissions organization, so it was literally an organization that worked directly with the admissions office as the student component to recruiting students to Spelman.         So I was working in that office that summer, which was actually the same summer that Byllye Avery and Lily Allen hosted the National Black Women&#8217;s Health Conference, first ever on black women&#8217;s health issues on Spelman&#8217;s campus, and I mean my nose was wide open. I played hooky for a week from work, attended the conference, met all of these incredible people from June Jordan to Angela Davis to Nikky Finney to all of Sweet Honey in the Rock, Alice Walker, Paula Giddings. I mean all of these people were at this meeting and it just blew my mind. I was a biology major; by that time I was an English major so that I could go more into studying literature and reading these women&#8217;s works. I also couldn&#8217;t do the MD thing because I couldn&#8217;t dissect a pig, and still couldn&#8217;t.         So that was really my entr&#233;e, so there was this bridge between doing this anti-apartheid work in terms of black liberation stuff that I didn&#8217;t get a chance to participate in, in the late &#8217;60s, early &#8217;70s, because I was a baby, and then getting more involved directly because here I am on a black women&#8217;s campus where health issues weren&#8217;t really addressed, dealt with, or programmed in any particular way, while I was a student.        CGD: And so what health issues did you see on campus that weren&#8217;t getting attention at Spelman?        DDD: Well I&#8217;m going to say mostly reproductive health issues. I mean, you know. I don&#8217;t know who had other illnesses or issues like diabetes. We weren&#8217;t aware of those kinds of things and we didn&#8217;t have&#8212;. Health centers nowadays on campuses are much more sophisticated and provide a lot more services. For us it was like if you&#8217;re sick, if you have a cold, if you have the flu, if you have a headache, if you have really bad cramps, you go to the health center. That was pretty much it. Otherwise you called 911 and you go to Grady, which is our big public hospital. So my engagement in the apartheid movement and in the black women&#8217;s health movement actually bridged for where I found my own feminism, so to speak. I got a chance to study&#8212;. When I switched to English Dr. Beverly Guy-Sheftall became one of my advisors as well as Dr.&#8212;I can&#8217;t think of her name. It&#8217;ll come to me, whenever I see her it&#8217;ll come to me&#8212;who I had as another advisor, two black women who were in the English department at the time. I mean it was when the women&#8217;s research and resource center was Beverly&#8217;s desk and office, right? We didn&#8217;t actually have one. She was operating out of that, building the center from that, and so my intro to feminism.         So there&#8217;s race and there&#8217;s gender and there was all of that going on for me between my first and second year, and in my second year, yeah, it got a little sticky and we had some issues with some&#8212;. There was some race stuff that happened on our campus, with a professor, so we had some issues with that and&#8212;.        CGD: What do you mean, &#8220;race stuff?&#8221;        DDD: No, really, we had a philosophy professor who in one lecture&#8212;I think we were dealing with Plato&#8212;and in one lecture slipped, not once but at least twice, instead of saying &#8220;might is right&#8221; saying &#8220;white is right.&#8221; We corrected him on it and he wouldn&#8217;t go into conversation with us about it, was very defensive about it, and we thought, well, how is this possible on this campus that you have to teach us philosophy but we can&#8217;t have this discussion? It really upset us because we had to take his class. I was in the honors program, right, on scholarship.        CGD: And I&#8217;m assuming&#8212;. Was he white or African American?        DDD: He was a white man, white, heterosexual man. So it got kind of contentious because some of us said well we don&#8217;t want to take his class, and if you didn&#8217;t want to take his class then you couldn&#8217;t be in the honors program because you were relegated to the scholar honors classes. So after a while&#8212;and it was sort of a combination, because I was changing my major, I wasn&#8217;t doing that well in math anyway, blah, blah, blah, so I said, you know what, I can&#8217;t sit&#8212;. We can&#8217;t&#8212;. I said I couldn&#8217;t. Everybody else was complaining but nobody else left it, and I actually did because I knew I could have opportunities for other funding for school, like grants and Pell grants and student loans, so I let it go. I left the scholarship, which also meant I had to go to work. So I went to work and&#8212;.        CGD: Where did you work?        DDD: First I worked at McDonald&#8217;s for six months, became a vegetarian. [Laughs] And it was really interesting because I started to look for another job because I was on the verge of being fired before I quit, simply because I wouldn&#8217;t&#8212;. I was giving away the destroyed food every night to the homeless people, because I worked downtown. How are you going to walk to the train station and pass by all of these people, and I just threw away pounds of food; it made no sense. But you know it&#8217;s kind of a rule at the place that you don&#8217;t give away the food that was just cooked but set to be destroyed, right?         So, out of that I went and found another job, which was really interesting. I was looking through the Creative Loafing, which is the free weekly paper, and found an announcement that was looking for health workers. It was exciting. I went; it was a totally, totally unfamiliar, like jolting almost but really fascinating and intriguing experience, because it was the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center. Back in the &#8217;80s it really was grassroots, Birkenstock, hairy, you know, [Laughs] I mean feminist women who were providing probably better healthcare than some of our local community health centers or clinics, or even private docs. Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center is the&#8212;. Where the Black Women&#8217;s Health Project is the self-help core, you know the core of self-help was in emotional and mental and spiritual empowerment or learning and wellbeing and education and knowledge, the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center model of self-help was the physical. It was: Understand GYN care, know how to do abortions, know how to control menstruation, know how to control birth and pregnancy contraception and know your body better than your OB-GYN knows it. So that was really an eye-opening experience because for the first six weeks of the job, one, you didn&#8217;t get paid, two, you were in training, and three, I learned more in those six weeks working at that health center for free than I could have learned probably in two semesters of medical school.        CGD: So had you had the sex and reproduction and body change talks with your mother?        DDD: Oh, my goodness, absolutely. That was the other ease of the exposure, right, because I grew up in a house of biologists, for whom everything zoological, human physiological, whatever it was, was scientific. You knew the names of all your body parts by the Latin enunciation of it and you knew bugs and trees and plants and animals by their Latin monikers. So talking about the life cycle and sex and reproduction, and reproductive anatomy, and contraception, and safer behaviors and all of that started when I was ten, if not earlier. I just remember when I was ten getting the&#8212;no, it might have been earlier&#8212;getting the life cycle encyclopedia, Mommy having all of these biology books that even had chapters on birth and sex and all of that, that you could learn. My aunt, who ran five family planning clinics for Fulton County in Atlanta would send us those girlie kits every year that had the menstruation instructions and the cute little cartoons and all the different stuff, the tools that you would use, whether it was sanitary napkins or pads&#8212;well they didn&#8217;t have pads way back then, but sanitary napkins, you know, with the belts, [Laughs] and the old tampons and all that kind of stuff. That usually came at the beginning of the school year and at the springtime came the kits with all of the different contraceptive options so that you would learn about that, so there was diaphragms and little&#8212;.        CGD: So your aunt was sending you&#8212;?        DDD: My aunt would send that stuff to us, yeah.        CGD: Wow.        DDD: Yeah, but it was also so that my dad and my mom, they distributed it on campus through the science department, so they were giving it out to other students and kids, but it was coming to us so that we could learn all that stuff. So, yeah, I mean we got exposed to all of that very matter-of-factly, unambiguously, from the beginning, all three of the kids. I think that&#8217;s probably to my parents&#8217; chagrin, since they still don&#8217;t have any grandchildren. But anyway, [Laughs] they did too good a job. No, I&#8217;m not able to have kids. But anyway, so that was the exposure to it, and the whole introduction to the menstruation thing, not being embarrassed, knowing, expecting it, when is it coming and wanting to share it and all of the news about it with my mom and all of that, was normal in our house.        CGD: So was going to&#8212;? I mean obviously you learned even more at the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center, but was there anything jarring or different about that experience?        DDD: Yes. I mean I don&#8217;t know if it was jarring but it was certainly new. It wasn&#8217;t jarring but it certainly was outside what was comfortable and typical at the outset and then made all the sense in the world, which was like cervical self exam, right, or that was the first time I had learned breast self exam. It was the first time I had seen how simple&#8212;and I don&#8217;t mean to put this disrespectfully&#8212;but how incredibly difficult a choice, for example, like abortion was, but how comfortable and&#8212;. Yeah, simple isn&#8217;t the word I want to use, but comfortable and practical and&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;ll come to me. But the way that we put together the process of providing abortion services, you&#8217;d never find it anywhere else because this was women&#8217;s center, this was us&#8212;. I mean we trained our doctors that came to that clinic. They might have been formally trained through their medical education to perform abortions but they weren&#8217;t trained in the feminist style. They weren&#8217;t trained to make sure that the woman was always the center of whatever was going on, and that&#8217;s how we operated. Sitting with women and walking through every step of the procedure and answering questions and getting the opportunity to teach women about their bodies while at the same time really lower their own anxieties and nervousness or their inhibitions about what they were choosing to do and how they were having to go through it, and then being able to work in every single corner of that clinic to learn the whole experience, and how to run a nonprofit. I mean all of that came for me in the six years that I worked at the Feminist Health Center.         CGD: Did you have any concerns about abortion provision when you went there?        DDD: No. I didn&#8217;t have any concerns about abortion provision, and I think that&#8217;s mostly because I had just spent my first year plus&#8212;. First of all, I grew up in a pretty progressive house, not that we talked about abortion per se, but I know my parents are&#8212;. They would support people&#8217;s choices, period. They may not be pro-abortion, so to speak, but they&#8217;re not anti-choice, so I do know that, and that&#8217;s only because they&#8217;re Christian, and black folks tend to be more socially conservative. So, that I didn&#8217;t have an issue with. I think there&#8217;s probably&#8212;. The only level is I also used to work in what we call the sterile room, where all of the equipment and what we call the products of conception would come and you&#8217;d have to do all the processes to make sure that everything was there, that the abortion was complete, that it was packaged properly, that it was made of, in terms of ready for hazardous material pickup stuff, and so while from a purely scientific and medical standpoint that was really fascinating, from really just the human level&#8212;. Because we used to do abortions up, I think, to twenty-four weeks, and so the further along people were the harder it was, honestly, the harder it was, and I had become&#8212;and I don&#8217;t mean to compare people to animals&#8212;but I had become vegetarian for lots of reasons after seeing films about how animals are treated in slaughtering and all that kind of stuff, and the same kind of feeling I had about not wanting to dissect a pig to become a medical practitioner was the same feeling I would have about some of the later term abortions. But what overrode all of that for me was whenever I went into the aftercare room to let a woman know that she was okay and that everything was complete from the lab&#8217;s perspective, that overrode it for me every single time you had a woman who just the sheer drop of her shoulders and the look of relief, and the sense of grief with relief that they would have meant that it was okay.        CGD: And so who were the clients at the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center?        DDD: Everybody, every woman from every walk of life, because the Feminist Center was what it was, and would stress confidentiality, had a sliding scale, charged regular fees for women who could afford it, took insurance for women who had insurance, and had a sliding scale for women who were Medicaid eligible or lower income. So we saw just about everybody, and for a long time I think we were the only clinic with a sliding scale, so we probably saw more lower income women than some of the other private clinics did see. I don&#8217;t know that for sure, but I know what was important about that was I was the only woman of color lay health worker for the longest time, and so it became even more important that even if I wasn&#8217;t in the room with every single one of them, every time a black woman came to that clinic I made sure that she knew I was there, even if she didn&#8217;t see me. Even if I was working in the sterile room, right, I would go&#8212;. Because you see the charts and they have to check the race and so you would see who they were and I would personally make sure I went and spoke or sat with them or talked to them and just let them know that there&#8217;s somebody here who&#8217;s also like you.        CGD: And so if you were the only woman of color lay health worker&#8212;.        DDD: And the youngest.        CGD: How many people were there?        DDD: I don&#8217;t remember. At any time during clinics depending, because on our later abortion days we had more staff, but generally I&#8217;d say there were probably between&#8212;I can&#8217;t remember&#8212;between maybe seven and twelve of us who were the health workers. We didn&#8217;t all work in the same clinic at the same time but on staff. There were other black women at the organization, at the clinic, but they had other roles, like intake, reception, the financial responsibilities, or the medical records stuff, behind the scenes stuff. We had even the woman who cleaned the buildings. I can&#8217;t even remember her name; I just remember her face and her strength for me. But yeah, I don&#8217;t think&#8212;. I can&#8217;t ever remember, maybe after I left, a time when we had any black women in upper management or senior management, mostly because the women who still ran the clinic were the three co-founders.        CGD: What were their names?        DDD: Lynne Randall, Janet Callum, and Lynn Thogersen.         CGD: And so you started there, what, around &#8217;84?        DDD: &#8217;84, mm hmm.        CGD: And so how long did you work there?        DDD: &#8217;89.         CGD: Okay, so you were there during the &#8220;Siege of Atlanta.&#8221;        DDD: Most definitely.        CGD: Okay. Do you refer to it as the &#8220;Siege of Atlanta?&#8221;        DDD: Yeah. Well I actually refer to it as &#8220;Operation Oppress You,&#8221; because the name they gave themselves was &#8220;Operation Rescue.&#8221; That was when Randall&#8212;. I think we were probably Randall Terry&#8217;s first big outing for his legions of nutcases&#8212;that&#8217;s what I call them&#8212;and so I wouldn&#8217;t give it the title. You know, whenever we were talking to the news or talking to the paper I would twist the title and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Yes, Operation Oppress You,&#8221; and that&#8217;s what I would call it and that&#8217;s what they would quote me as saying. But I do describe that time as when we were under siege, because we literally were.        CGD: So what was it like to be going to the clinic?        DDD: It meant every day, especially on abortion clinic days, which were four days out of the week, but even on well woman days, it meant that we had to get to work maybe sometimes at sunrise, 7:00 AM in the morning, even if the clinic didn&#8217;t open before 9:00 or 10:00. Sometimes it meant being lifted by big burly cops over human carpets just to get in the door. It meant being surveilled, being called at home, getting bomb threats. It meant spending lots of time in court. I was part time community relations at that time, or by that time, so it meant having to interact with the antis, you know, doing their photos, making sure we were doing our own surveillance of who was coming, who was around the clinic. It meant managing many, many volunteers for clinic defense. It meant really zapping the budget of the clinic, because I was also by that time really building up our HIV prevention work and it suffered tremendously. That&#8217;s actually why I ended up leaving, because we had no money, one, and things were so tense with trying to protect the clinic that HIV/AIDS really wasn&#8217;t on their agenda, so that&#8217;s when I left to start doing AIDS work.        CGD: How could volunteers&#8212;? How did you actually defend the clinic?        DDD: So, we had to pay lots of money for security, and I mean physical security in the sense of re-outfitting the entire building, all the way to paying off duty police officers, which was really expensive. It meant having dozens of volunteers who provided, when we say clinic defense, who would create the lines around the clinic to keep the antis from getting too close, who would escort women from their cars to the building because we didn&#8217;t have an entrance directly from the parking lot. You would have to come from across the street or down the street, and so women would have to cross those lines to get to us. It meant reporting any and everything strange that happened in our homes because we got called at home. I remember a note on my car, outside my house. So I mean those are the kinds of things. We had phone trees for when something would happen or something went terrible or that sort of thing. We had lots of false alarms. We don&#8217;t know if people were trying to get in the building or what. It meant having to guard our garbage and our trash and our hazardous materials. I mean how else do they get those pictures, right, of the aborted fetuses? So that&#8217;s what clinic defense meant. It was on all fronts, all the way from armed guards to volunteers to protect the women.        CGD: And what did the note on your car say?        DDD: Oh, I mean the note was just one of those anti-abortion flyers that I can&#8217;t even remember, you know, with the nasty picture, but it was put on my car at my house, which was parked in behind my house on a driveway, which meant they knew where I lived, plus we got phone calls, like bomb threat type calls. So we got bomb threats, all of that kind of stuff, so we&#8217;d end up having to engage the FBI and the ATF [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives], ATF coming out on a regular basis to sweep the building, that kind of stuff.        CGD: And how long did that go on?        DDD: So, it started during the Democratic National Convention of 1988, which would have been in the late summer, right, and it went on for a year, because I left a year later and it was still going on. It would dwindle out, like over holidays, but there was never not a small or a big group of anti-abortion protestors for almost a whole year.        CGD: And when you say a big group, how big could that be?        DDD: Well, like during the DNC and just post-DNC, hundreds of people, yeah. I didn&#8217;t bring them for you today. I can share them with you. I still have photos of those days when they would like&#8212;. One of the funniest pictures is&#8212;because we would also have the police, the metal barriers around the clinic, and there are pictures, you know, where you see the people literally trying to crawl under and through cops&#8217; legs to get under these things, and I have pictures of them coming through. We took pictures of the craziest ones, just in case we needed to go to court and we could point them out, which sometimes we did, because they might have touched us or grabbed us or hurt us or something like that. So they would pull stunts like crawling like babies&#8212;because we were on a hill&#8212;up the hill, just these really weird optics of their behaviors, the shouting, the accosting the women, the making the human carpets, like fifteen people deep, so that you&#8217;re literally getting relayed by cops over these people into the building, placards, drive-bys, all that kind of stuff.        CGD: And so how did you do that?        DDD: I don&#8217;t know how to answer that. Because there was always women who needed to be served, always. So I don&#8217;t know how; I know why. Yeah. There wasn&#8217;t a day we closed, I don&#8217;t think. There might have been some days we had to open later but there wasn&#8217;t a day that we chose not to open.        CGD: And what was the demographic of those protestors?        DDD: White, period. I can remember, even over the course of the year, maybe three to five at the most black folk who might have showed up. I can look back on the pictures and I don&#8217;t remember seeing anybody black in any of those pictures.        CGD: But were there women of color among the volunteers?        DDD: Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean there were more white women but yeah. We had student volunteers from the local campuses, because we would zap the campuses too, I remember, just in advertising our services, and actually, because I remember that&#8217;s how I learned about where I worked, was by the time I answered the ad and had spent six weeks in training at Feminist then one day I&#8217;m in the bathroom at Spelman in one of my dorms or one of the classroom buildings, and I looked up and there was one of the stickers. We used to put stickers on the back of all the doors. Well those stickers were there before I started working at Feminist and I can remember going back and stickering doors after I had started working there. So we had our own little guerilla type outreach on different campuses and by extension of that there were also women who would come for abortions, or their friends would come with them, and then maybe their friends would come back and help other women. We saw that happen a few times.         CGD: And so how do you think that experience affected the work&#8212;? I mean obviously you said HIV programs that were just getting launched got short shrift.        DDD: Right.        CGD: So how did you leave the&#8212;? Was there internal conflict about the HIV&#8212;?        DDD: Yes. There was internal conflict around the fact that HIV wasn&#8217;t generating any money. This was during the Reagan era, &#8220;Mexico City&#8221; had been in place [Mexico City Policy implemented in 1984. It withheld USAID funds to NGOs that promoted abortion as a form of family planning with non-USAID money.], so there was no way we were going to get any of that nice new CDC HIV prevention money, because that&#8217;s where prevention money was coming from, was only from the federal government, very little in the private. Private sector funding was mostly going towards saving people&#8217;s lives, taking care of the dying, the types of programs that we don&#8217;t have anymore for people with AIDS because people are living with HIV, right? So we weren&#8217;t going to get any real substantial prevention funding. That was one. The anti-abortion campaign that was going on every day was taxing the budget like nobody&#8217;s business. Hiring lawyers and all of that kind of stuff and being in court all the time and security; all that was really difficult.         So it was a combination of that and the politics of the issues which was AIDS just wasn&#8217;t going to be high on these women&#8217;s agenda, meaning my directors, anyway, and they knew it because&#8212;. I mean I run a nonprofit now and I know for example boards don&#8217;t have anything to do with programs, right, pretty much. They knew what they were doing because I had argued so much about why this issue was important for feminists because it was a reproductive health issue. Even then I was trying to argue how HIV and AIDS for women was a reproductive health issue. So I think that my own internal&#8212;. Plus I was a little bit of a&#8212;how do I want to put it?&#8212;the insider agitator, almost. It&#8217;s like when I was told that I had to shave my hair once because of our clientele or whatnot&#8212;. [Mobile phone rings] I&#8217;ll have to call her back. When I was told that I went straight to one of the Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center&#8217;s publications, A New View of a Woman&#8217;s Body, which in the opening paragraph talks about how women come in all ways and we don&#8217;t discriminate and we accept them all, including hairy bodies, and blah, blah, blah. I took that same page and&#8212;I think people remember this more than anything&#8212;I got into. Because I used to live closest to the clinic, I lived like three blocks from the clinic, and I got in there one night when we were closed and ran about twenty-five copies of that one page and when people came to work the next day it was taped in every office on every wall on every door of the entire clinic, just to remind my director that this is feminist theory, not what you&#8217;re telling me I have to be in this clinic. So I was always a little bit of an agitator.         So when they were closing the AIDS prevention program they actually took it to the board and made a board vote, and I knew that that vote was happening at that board meeting and that&#8217;s when I had brought my women of color advisory board that I had formed that they had not paid any&#8212;. I think my boss came to one of our meetings in two years. They showed up to the board meeting and sat there quietly until the board made its vote and sun-downed the program and we said, thank you; we&#8217;ll take it.         CGD: Who was the ED then?        DDD: Lynne Randall.        CGD: Okay, so this is in &#8217;84.        DDD: &#8217;89.        CGD: &#8217;89, okay.        DDD: That all happened in &#8217;89.        CGD: Okay, so by that time there is awareness about AIDS. I mean &#8217;81 is when you first hear the CDC talking about it&#8212;        DDD: Yeah.        CGD: &#8212;so what did the&#8212;?        DDD: And there were women being diagnosed and we knew&#8212;yeah, yeah.        CGD: Did you test women at&#8212;?        DDD: I don&#8217;t think Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center started doing HIV testing until&#8212;. I&#8217;m going to say it was the late &#8217;90s, maybe. I&#8217;m going to say it was the&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know, but I know it was much later, much later.        CGD: So what did the epidemic look like in Atlanta at that time?        DDD: At that time it was still very much a gay white man&#8217;s disease, or what it looked like was a gay white man&#8217;s disease, except there were people at Grady, a lot of black folk, including black women, who were getting sick and dying and having babies that were really sick and dying. So it was an equal opportunity, I would say starting somewhere in the mid to late &#8217;80s. I always tell folks the way I even got started in this was in the summer of &#8217;85 when Rock Hudson announced his AIDS diagnosis [first major celebrity to die from an AIDS related illness], for some reason over at AID Atlanta&#8212;which was only like maybe two years old at this point, maybe about a year or two old at this point&#8212;they started getting calls from women wanting to get information and women who were sick and didn&#8217;t know what it was and maybe they had it. They didn&#8217;t know what to do with that because they were serving men, so they called on those of us who were doing reproductive health work and they wanted people of color because they were getting mostly black women showing up, right, who were sick, that they wanted us to come help them figure it out. So that&#8217;s how I got started in the volunteering, and it was through AID Atlanta&#8217;s own upheavals that one of my co-workers who was also volunteering with me at the time, [Mary Lynn Hemphill], who to this day is still working in HIV and AIDS after she left Feminist, she and I both brought the women&#8217;s AIDS prevention project that we had helped developed at AID Atlanta, brought it to Feminist Women&#8217;s Health Center. So that&#8217;s how we got the HIV/AIDS work in the first place, is because she and I went out and started volunteering, and when they dropped it at AID Atlanta we brought it back home with us.        CGD: And so SisterLove is born.        DDD: Yeah.        CGD: How did that&#8212;? You had had this women of color advisory committee at Feminist, and so did that&#8212;?        DDD: Morph into the board, it surely did. Sabrina Sojourner, who is an LGBT activist and she was a writer, a journalist, here in Atlanta and very active with the LGBT and the AIDS community, became our chair of the board.        CGD: Was there&#8212;?        DDD: Loretta Ross, when she moved to Atlanta, she became one of my founding board members.        CGD: Was there a really strong black feminist community in Atlanta before Byllye Avery and Black Women&#8217;s Health Project? I mean where&#8212;        DDD: I don&#8217;t know.        CGD: &#8212;would you go?        DDD: I don&#8217;t know, because I was seventeen when I met Byllye and them so I don&#8217;t know what was here before then. I know what was here in the late &#8217;80s, early &#8217;90s. I don&#8217;t know what it is now, but no, I don&#8217;t&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know. It was different. I mean just like how do you compare eras that have different challenges in them, right, when you didn&#8217;t have smart phones, and when you didn&#8217;t have social networks on the internet and when you didn&#8217;t have fax machines even [Laughs] until somewhere in the mid &#8217;80s, for those of us who weren&#8217;t in big corporations. So I think feminism and feminist activism then had to, just like about everything else nowadays, have been, yeah, we were a lot closer. We interacted a lot more. We met up at each other&#8217;s houses all the time. I can&#8217;t tell you, I don&#8217;t know people&#8217;s houses now, but that&#8217;s just because I&#8217;m just so busy I&#8217;m more anti-social than anything. [Mobile phone rings] Three, oh, one&#8212;. I&#8217;m going to have to get that. I&#8217;m trying to think. [Break in recording]        CGD: All right, we are starting again. So we were talking about the founding of SisterLove, and did you experience&#8212;? What was the community response to what you were trying to do?        DDD: It was hard. I mean first of all in terms of the operations of what I was trying to do it was just me. All my board had stuff going on so I was the one that sort of brought the vision, revamped what became the Healthy Love Party, which was our main thing that got SisterLove started in the first place, was our prevention intervention.         CGD: Can you talk more about that Healthy Love Party and your intervention?        DDD: Yeah. Let&#8217;s just say it was what they now call home grown but it was developed in community with community, a way of&#8212;. It was a workshop that was intended to make safe sex fun, that was the original part of it, and it morphed into becoming more of a place where we could also deal with sex and sexuality, women&#8217;s power and their own comfort with their own sexuality. We could deal with the practical stuff around condom use but we could also make it really sexy and really fun so that it was more acceptable and had more impact than just the 101-style education/information exchange. We also included the self help model so that we&#8217;d create a way that it was a safe space for women to deal with the hard stuff around their own experiences that made it hard for them to deal with their sex and sexuality, or not.         So that&#8217;s what we had created, which has gone through many different iterations and evolutions and by today has been deemed an Evidence Based Intervention by the Centers for Disease Control, it&#8217;s been published in their national compendium [An EBI is a treatment or practice that has proven effective in changing target behavior. The EBI movement has extensive history and success in the medical and counseling fields]. We&#8217;re undergoing right now a replication phase which will mean it&#8217;s going to get piloted in other communities to determine and compare it&#8217;s efficacy, as we have found in Atlanta, and I would say probably within the next eighteen months or so we will become a formal DEBI, which is one of those Diffused Evidence Based Interventions that if and should the CDC ever have money to do behavioral prevention ever again, [Laughs] other communities could be funded to implement our intervention. That&#8217;s what the Healthy Love Party was and is today.         So trying to get that out there in the community, and at the same time because there wasn&#8217;t HIV, right, there was still AIDS at that point, right, so especially in the black community it was very mixed. In the LGBTQ community everybody was like, oh my God, thank you for doing what you&#8217;re doing, especially gay men. As a matter of fact the brother who worked at Spelman College as the assistant director of financial aid turns out happened to be bisexual, probably mostly homosexual, who had helped rescue me in my senior year with financial aid when it looked like I didn&#8217;t have a dime left to get out of college, used to throw these amazing parties, black and white parties, and was also a co-founder of Black and White Men Together, which was one of the first gay men&#8217;s groups that was a social but also a social justice network, and also Black Lesbian and Gay Network, or coalition, I can&#8217;t remember the name of it, here in Atlanta. As a matter of fact, the first community service award I ever got for doing AIDS work came from that organization in his name after his death from AIDS. I got a Marquis Walker Award, which was just incredible.         But anyway, so from that part of the community there was a lot of acceptance and support and from the general community it was tough, but I&#8217;ve never had a capacity to pay attention very much to naysayers, opposition and pooh-pooh-ers. I can&#8217;t tell you&#8212;. I&#8217;m just obtuse to it. I&#8217;ve never had the ability to know it very well when it&#8217;s like at me. If it&#8217;s at my organization, if it&#8217;s at the people I&#8217;m working for, I pick that up instantly and I&#8217;m like a mama with a cub, but when it came to me I just&#8212;. You know, I would recognize you sitting on the bus or on the train and somebody asks what you do and I tell them what I&#8217;m doing and I&#8217;m all excited about it and the next thing you know they move to the other side of the bus or the train. [Laughs] Or the assumption, even from the AIDS community, straight, gay, lesbian, or whatnot, the assumption that I either had to have AIDS or that I was lesbian because no straight black woman who&#8217;s not HIV-positive, why are you doing&#8212;? That was unfathomable because it wasn&#8217;t associated with us, so why would I be doing it, and the whole point was it is associated with us. The original thought I had, why I knew this was going to be serious for women, especially for black women, was because I was like, well you know what? If gay men are getting AIDS and it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re having sex with men, well who else has sex with men? Simple, very simple. So that&#8217;s what it was. There was a lot but it didn&#8217;t faze me. It didn&#8217;t faze me at all. I mean I think the most important thing was as long as I had my family support, my parents supported me, even though they were a little reluctant, not because of what I was doing but because I didn&#8217;t have one of them good government jobs with a long pension and a health insurance plan, but other than that&#8212;. They were concerned for me and my wellbeing and my security but the issue they were very okay with me working on, right, so as long as I had that I didn&#8217;t recognize too much of the rest of it.        CGD: And your parents have a history of service as educators, so.        DDD: A very long history of not only educators but community service, social service work. I mean my mother, for example, has been a CASA volunteer probably for fifteen plus years, court appointed advocates, and my father, I mean while it was in the capacity of his job&#8212;. Actually a guy who is finishing a post-doc in Toronto right now came up to me at the conference this week, telling me, &#8220;You&#8217;re Clinton Dixon&#8217;s daughter?&#8221; [I said,] &#8220;Yes, I am.&#8221; [He said,] &#8220;You know, he means the world to me. He was my advisor. He&#8217;s the reason I was in this PhD program,&#8221; blah, blah, blah. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people. The people who he&#8217;s deep sea fishing in Alaska with right now are all former students of his who are PhDs, MDs, DMDs, JDs, because he encouraged and worked with them to go on to their professional degrees and whatnot. So that&#8217;s who I come from.        CGD: Well I think I&#8217;m going to end now, but I want to see if we could talk more in depth about your HIV work&#8212;        DDD: Sure.        CGD: &#8212;at some point in the future.        DDD: Yes.        CGD: So I want to thank you so much.        DDD: Absolutely, and just check in because we may be in the same city at some point. I don&#8217;t know.        CGD: We may. All right, well thank you.
