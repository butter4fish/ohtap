 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Monday, October 13, 2008. I am in Enid, Oklahoma  interviewing Mrs. Corinne Gooch for O-STATE Stories, an oral history  project of the OSU Library. Thank you so much for joining us today.  Thank you for giving me this opportunity.  Well, we would like to touch upon a few things with you today. First we  really want to focus on your father, Mr. Earl Russell, and then go a little  bit into your life as a student at Oklahoma State, Oklahoma A M before  the name change. But let   s start with your father. Tell us a little bit  about where he grew up and his early life.  Dad was born over near Davis and it was Oklahoma Territory, in 1897.  That was before statehood. Then his family moved to east of Duncan,  out by Velma, and lived on a farm there. In fact, it   s quite interesting.  The deed to that farm was in two parcels of land and they are both  signed by the President of the Chickasaw Tribe and the Chief of the  Choctaw Tribe. I   m doing some research to see if perhaps we might be a  member of one of those tribes. We   re not sure, but I   m trying to find out.  He grew up on a farm and he had a brother and four sisters. My  grandfather was on the school board there. Dad told me that their  teacher   they always called their teachers    professor      the professor  just moved around and lived with the different people on the school  board. So he lived at their home some times. That was a pleasant  memory that Dad shared with me one time.  Then he and his brother Jesse decided that they would lease the farm  from their dad and run it on their own. They didn   t take to farming too  well. Dad loved to work with cattle. He bought his first calf when he  was eight years old. He just went through the eighth grade in school and  then he decided he needed to work. He was great on that working, I   m  5  telling you. So he started working for Frank C. Ford, F.C. Ford, who was  later my grandfather. He worked for my grandfather Ford for a long  time. In fact Dad told me that my grandpa taught him everything he  knew about cattle and about cattle buying and selling and trading. He  must have taught him a lot because he was really good at it. In fact,  that   s how he met my mom. As Dad would tell it, he would say,    Well,  me and two other cowboys were working for Old Man Ford and we had  to move cattle from the east side of Duncan to the west side of Duncan.     (I think they moved them right through the main street, because when I  was a kid, we did the same thing. We just moved the cattle right through  town, I know that sounds crazy now but we did.) Anyway Dad would  tell the story and he   d say,    We worked so hard running those cattle, and  wouldn   t you know, we ran out of daylight  So we had to spend the  night with Old Man Ford. Now Old Man Ford had two nice daughters.  (Actually, my grandparents had five daughters and two sons, but  evidently my mom Cora and Aunt Sarah were the only two at home at  the time.) And one of them got up and fixed our breakfast the next  morning at five o   clock and sent us on our way. When I got back home,  I told my brother Jesse,    Old Man Ford has two nice daughters. One of  them is going to make some cowboy a wonderful wife. And the other  one is just a living doll.       My mother was the living doll. They were  sweethearts from then on. Their friends called them    the cowboy and his  lady.    That was a good description of them.  Dad was an outdoors man, got up early every morning, went down to the  hotel and had coffee with the guys, went out to the ranch, checked the  pastures, came back in and went to the bank  Oklahoma National .  Usually I was with him in the summertime. I   m a sole survivor of three,  and so we used to say that I   m Dad   s only son. I would go with him on  those early mornings to the ranch and he would sing all the way. It was  funny, because now I   m a musician. But no one ever heard him sing but  me. He never sang in church or anything. But he would sing    Old  Faithful    and all those old country songs. The first time I ever sang a  solo was when Dad had an auction sale. He and Mr. Bruce Ridley were  partners and they had a livestock sale barn. They got a new microphone,  and my dad just leaned over and said,    Here       I was about six or  seven,    I want you to get up there and sing    Home on the Range   .    I  said,    Okay,    so I did. That was the beginning of my singing and  musical career.  Before he and Bruce Ridley were in the auction  business, Dad served two terms as Stephens County sheriff. He would  proudly say about his 2nd race:    I carried every box in the county       But Dad really enjoyed the livestock business. He told me that he and  my grandpa, when they were first in business (they went into business  together after my parents married) would go out on horseback and gather  up just two head at a time or three from the local farmers and ranchers.  6  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Then they would get a whole train car load of cattle. Dad and Grandpa  would ride the train with the cattle to Oklahoma City,  leaving Duncan  at 5 P.M., changing in El Reno to the    inter-urban    arriving in OKC  between 7 and 9 the next morning.  Then they would always sell just at  private treaty there. It turned into a wonderful business for them. It  became very lucrative.  In later years, I don   t remember how old I was, it seems like forever, he  went on the board of the Oklahoma National Bank, and was their Ag  expert. I can remember that lots of times Dad would, through the bank,  help young men get started in agriculture, buy some cows or just a few  head. And then he would go out and help them and show them all about  the Ag business. I have had several men come to me later and tell me  that they stayed with it, or Earl would tell him,    Now Son, I just don   t  think this is your business. You   re going to be losing money on these  cows now, so you need to think it through before you buy any more.    I  can hear him. That   s the way he talked to people he liked. I have had  more than one gentleman tell me that Dad saved him from losing money  by giving him good honest advice.  In his younger years, he and his brother Jesse were very close. They  stayed in business for a while together, and then Jesse went off to the oil  field; he became a very successful oil man in west Texas. Dad stayed  right there in Stephens County. My mother, Cora Ford Russell, was from  Stephens County people too, pioneers in that area. I told you about her  father, they were cattlemen together. I don   t know what else you want  me to tell you about this part.  Okay, well why don   t you tell me how he got appointed to the Board of  Regents?  All right.  In the beginning OAMC did not have its own separate  governing board. Dad was on the original board and served for twenty  years, longer than anyone else.  This is a good story: He said that Bob  Kerr called him, Governor Robert S. Kerr. He and Bob were great  friends. Dad said,    You know, he didn   t ask me. He just said,    Earl,  you   re going to be on this board. I want you to be on this Board.       Dad  felt a little bit, well, really humbled by it. He said he just had an eighth  grade education. I think he probably said,    Bob, I don   t know about  this.    Governor Kerr just wouldn   t take no for an answer. And so then he  served under Kerr and Turner and Gary and Edmonson. I think he served  under five different governors. Let me see here.  I believe the original  board was formed around 1945.   I wrote them down: Kerr, Turner, Murray, Murray, Gary, and   all  Democrats. Henry Bellmon, Oklahoma   s first Republican governor,  7  didn   t reappoint him. Dad said,    Oh I don   t blame Henry, he is a  Republican, and you know I am a Democrat.    But he and Henry  Bellmon were good friends too. He respected Governor Bellmon and  thought he made some wonderful, hard decisions, especially when  Bellmon was Senator, about the Panama Canal. When all that came up  and everybody was kind of against Senator Bellmon, my dad stood up  for him and said,    That   s what he thinks is right to do, and I think we  should support him in that decision.     He loved Oklahoma A M   he always called it    the college.       Mom,  I   m going to run up to    the college.       Richard Caldwell, editor of the  alumni magazine at that time, did an article on our family. In that article  Dad is quoted as saying that he thought education was one of the  greatest assets of being an American. He just so believed in it. And he  showed it in so many ways. He was so loyal to the University. He was  always looking for ways and things that the University might become  involved in that would    help these young people get a college  education.    He was always for the underdog.  Lots of times I would hear him talk to Forrest McIntyre. Now, Forrest  was a wonderful fellow. He and Dad were great friends. I don   t  remember his title, but he always came to the board meetings. Kind of  like the Executive Secretary of the board. He told them all about  everything that was happening and about the business at hand. Then Ms.  Helen   I don   t know if her name was Sittle or Settle, but she was the  secretary. She took all the minutes. And between Ms. Helen and Forrest,  they kept those guys in line on that board. We laughed a lot about it. He  was such a wonderful, wonderful gentleman, just seemed to know  everything about the goings on at the University.  Dad would call Ed  Morrison  and say,    Now Ed, I   ve got this kid here.  He   s a good kid, good folks, but he   s going to need a little help going to  college. I want you to help him find a job and now call me right back.     Ed would kind of shake his head sometimes when he would be visiting  with Mother and me about how many calls Dad would say,    Now we   ve  got to take care of this. Now I know you can do it Ed. Get this boy a job,  get this girl a job. They   re good folks, just need a little help. We   ve got  to get these kids an education.    That   s a tender memory as I think about  it.  Then later, at my own fiftieth reunion in Duncan, two of my dear friends  came to visit with me. Those reunions are wonderful. As we were  visiting, they told me that Dad had called them and said,    Now on  Saturday, Son, I   m going to take you up here to Stillwater. I want you to  see the college. Now you need to get yourself an education, you   re a  smart boy, good boy. I want you to think about this.    Two of them told  8  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  me that he took them up to the campus and helped them get enrolled,  helped them get a job. That was a story I had never known before. Later,  at his funeral, of course, several people told me that. And then his  nephew, John Ray Green, who still lives in Duncan who was a graduate  of OSU and whose father was a graduate of OSU, told me that several of  his friends told him that Dad had helped them in that way. We didn   t  know it.  Dad was modest in many ways. He was very extroverted, definitely, but  there was a side of him that was a little modest about things like that. He  really enjoyed his days on the board. He felt like he was making his  contribution to something that was bigger than he was. I   ve heard him  say that. He and Dr. Bennett were great friends. Dad knew, and so did I,  that Dr. Bennett was probably the smartest man we ever met. They were  friends in a very special way. Dr. Bennett really appreciated Dad   s ag    business expertise. And then of course, Dad really held Dr. Bennett in  awe because of his intellect and his way with people. Dr. Bennett and his  wife, Mrs. Bennett were genteel, wonderful people. Of course, I was just  nine years old when I met them. They kind of took me under their wing.  They were so sweet to me. Some of my most cherished memories of  growing up were going up to the college with Dad and mom and being  around all those wonderful people on the board. In fact, I still have a  book that I read fairly regularly. A book of poetry and quotations that  Mrs. Bennett sent to me when I had my appendix out when I was  thirteen. I still have the little card. On one side of the card it says,     President   s Home, Oklahoma A M College    On the other side it says,     We love you, Mr. and Mrs. Bennett.    So sweet, and that   s the kind of  people they were. Dr. Bennett and Dad were on the same page. They  were on the same page when it came to education. Dad would say that  Dr. Bennett could go down to that Legislature and in the name of  agriculture, come home with bushels of money. And he could. He knew  the importance of what he was doing, so did Dad.  So as a little girl, you remember going up to the college a lot.  Yes, I do.  Do you remember board meetings at all?  As I say, they had their meetings on Friday evenings and then they  would meet on Saturday mornings, I think they started pretty early in the  morning and meet    til noon. Then whatever family was there that day,  we all had lunch together at the Student Union. Mrs. Drummond and  Mother were very good friends. Fred Drummond was on the original  board with Dad, and they just hit it off right from the beginning. Mrs.  Drummond, I think her name was Grace, and my mother became good  9  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  friends. Then later, when I pledged Kappa Kappa Gamma their daughter,  Mary Duff Drummond, was already a member and we became friends.  So our friendship with the Drummond family was just a wonderful  gift   a side effect of Dad   s being on the board. And there were others.  John Pat Carpenter and the man from, I can   t remember, the man who  was the president of Okmulgee Tech, he and his wife remained very  good friends, the Covells. We would hear from them or they might come  by to see us even after Dad was off the board. So it was just kind of a  special gift for me for Dad to be on that board and for me to meet all  those wonderful people. And then go to school there. It was really neat  also to have my daddy   s name on those cornerstones of those  buildings   a priceless heritage for me and my children and  grandchildren.  And I   m sure he saw a lot of buildings spring up.  Yes, he did. When we first started going up there, there was a dirt road  right in front of where the student union is now. The paved   seemed to  me it was just a black top on that street. What   d you say the name of that  street was?  Washington?  Washington. It sort of stopped where the campus began. Then beyond it  was just a dirt road. And that dirt road went all the way north   in my  recollection it went north even past where the library is now. Of course,  during Daddy   s tenure, they built the Student Union, built the library. I  remember hearing Dad and Dr. Bennett talking about whether they were  going to use self-liquidating bonds to get the money for the library,  which Dad thought they should do. He thought,    Let it pay for itself as it  goes.    That was from his banking background. When they built the  library and put the fountain in front of it, that was a wonderful  experience for everyone involved with the University, especially for  Dad. He was so proud of those buildings. And then they built the  Classroom Building. Mainly, the Student Union and the library are the  ones I would remember the most.  But I would hear him and Dr. Bennett also talk about football coaches  and a lot about the ag program and the future of the University, of  course, through Dad   s point of view, through agriculture.  Dad used to  quip that although Dr. Bennett was surely helping to shape world destiny  through his chairmanship of the Point Four programs,    He still kind of  enjoyed talking to a Stephens county cowboy.      One time Dr. Bennett  asked Dad to accompany him on a Point Four trip to South America, but  Dad felt that was a bit beyond his comfort zone, so he declined.   Sometimes  Dr. Bennett  was interested in the music school, but not a  10  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  lot. That was my major. My friends would say,    Can   t you get him to get  us a new building? Good grief, this old Crutchfield Building is terrible      And it was. It was not air conditioned. And it was located right behind or  south of the football stadium. Right across the street was tennis   I think  those tennis courts are still there, are they? Well, here we would be  trudging into Crutchfield, which was so hot, to practice and to go to  class and whatever. And all these others were playing tennis. (The  Seretean Center is so fabulous now ) That was a little hard. But not too  hard.  I enjoyed every minute of my time at OSU. In some ways I think it  was   well of course you have areas in your life, sections of your life,  I   m 73 and so I   ve got quite a few sections. I think that part of my life  could be right up there as the happiest time in my life. So carefree and  happy, involved in a lot of things. My mother always said, and so did  Dad,    Try to give yourself to something bigger than you are.    When you  get to the university, you realize that, or at least I did. Mr. White was our  professor of humanities. He was my favorite, outside the music school.  In the humanities class, we thought about a lot of things that are bigger  than we were. And I appreciate that. I   ve referred to it for the rest of my  life.  How did you make the decision to go to Oklahoma A M?  Glad you asked. My mother   s sister thought that a girl should go to a  girl   s school the first year after high school. So she thought I should go  to Sophie Newcomb which is down near New Orleans. Well I thought  well maybe, okay. I had a lot of confidence. My aunts all had a lot of  influence on me because I was the only child and my mother had these  four sisters and they doted on me, I know they did. Anyway I listened to  this aunt and I got an application to Sophie Newcomb. Had it all filled  out with the stamp on the envelope, sealed. Well, the weekend before I  was going to mail it, we    just happened    to go to a basketball game up at  OSU   up at OAMC. I think I took a boyfriend with me but we knew  everyone up there. I   m sure my parents made sure that we got to see lots  of people we knew. Although I promise you they did not pressure me--  they did not   but when I came home and thought it through, I thought  you know, maybe that   s where I belong. I know everyone up there. I  already kind of have maybe just a little niche of my own, special. I  remember that morning. Dad never ate breakfast with us, he got up too  early. But I remember taking that envelope down to the breakfast table  and saying,    I don   t think I   ll mail this Mother.    And she got a big smile  on her face, and Dad did too when he came home at noon. I never  regretted it. Never.  What year did you enroll at Oklahoma A M?  11  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  1953 and graduated in 1957. As I told you I was a Kappa. I was an  Aggie Sweetheart which means that I sang with the Men   s Glee Club.  There were three of us the first year.  The other two girls were Nami  Lamb and Vaughdeen Dobbs.  That was fun. Those guys were so much  fun and so nice. And we traveled everywhere. Cy Perkins was the  director and he was my other favorite professor, in the music school.  That was really lots of fun and I sang with them for two years and then I  got married.  Where did you live when you first enrolled?  I lived at Stout. It was the newest of the dorms. At first I lived on the  third floor. My roommate was a girl named Jan Smith. We had never  met and we got along great. She was from Guthrie. Just taking potluck  was a chance we took, but it all worked out beautifully. God is good.  God   s looked after me. Jan pledged Theta, and I pledged Kappa, and we  lived on the third floor. It was a long way to get everything done. The  elevator wasn   t always available. A room came   I had forgotten about  this but a room came available on the first floor in the corner and so we  took that room. Well, then when our boyfriends wanted to come by and  talk to us after hours, they could  Which they did. Oh my goodness, I  had forgotten all about that. That was fun. I guess we had a little method  in our madness when we took that room. I remember there were some  cedar bushes kind of by those trees but they could squeeze in between  them and come and talk to us. We thought that was quite romantic,  which it was.  Did you eventually move into the sorority house?  Yes I did. When I was a sophomore, I moved into the Kappa house and  was scholarship chairman. I really didn   t like that job very well because  I didn   t like to tell people what to do. I guess I must have been pretty  good at it or they wouldn   t have elected me. I remember we had some  study halls during semester   during finals. We would have our study  hall over at the library and all the freshman and anybody whose grades  were low had to come over there and study, I guess the weekend before  finals. But I had to too, because I was in charge. I remember one  evening, all the girls were sitting down at that end of this big room at the  library. All their dates were sitting down here waiting, and mine too. I  thought,    this is ridiculous.    So I remembered thinking,    Well I   m going  to take a chance, and I may get in trouble but surely they won   t tell on  me.    I got up and went like this (whispers)    Let   s get out of here     And  we all left. Everybody was happy and no one told on me. We did get the  scholarship trophy so that was worth it.  Absolutely.  12  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Yes.  Do you remember your house mother?  We had several. In fact, the Kappa house then was where the Phi  Gamma  Delta  house is now and we didn   t have the drive around in  front. We had only one entrance, it was that same entrance on the west  side and our boyfriends used to call it the house with no front door,  which it was. Anyway, there was kind of a mound of grass that was kind  of mounded in the front and the boys used to say that that is where we  buried all of our house mothers because we went through so many. I  don   t know why. I wasn   t in the capacity to know how they hired or  fired or what we did or why they quit, but we had quite a few house  mothers.  Well, describe a typical date for us. You mentioned all these boyfriends.  A typical date? Well, back in the time I was dating in college usually the  date, the fellow, made the decision of what you were going to do. I  mean, it wouldn   t have occurred to me to say,    I don   t think I want to do  this, let   s go do       You know like going to a movie, and that   s really  what we did a lot. We went to movies and places where we could dance.  We had    Dance Hour    on Wednesday night. Have you heard of that?  I have, but I would like you to tell me.  Well, the fraternities sent over all their pledges to our house. Then we  just lined up and we started out with a partner. You know, it was just a  get together to get to know each other, and I met some nice guys. That  was a nice way for the gals and guys to get to know each other. But it  was on Wednesday night, and being a good Baptist girl, I went to choir  practice. Now looking back, I don   t think I would do that again. But I  did, I went to choir practice, so I got excused a lot of times from those  Wednesday night deals. But it was fun. The Dance Hour was fun. I met a  lot of Sigma Nu   s and a lot of Beta   s. It seems like our house dated a lot  in those two houses. And that was fun. Some of the girls kind of dreaded  it, but I always thought it was fun.  Were there dancing opportunities anywhere else on campus? Outside of  Dance Hour?  Yes, at the Student Union. The Student Union was just a wonderful  place to go. I remember   what did they call that dance? The dirty bop.  The dirty bop. And there was a Sigma Nu who could do it better than  anyone I ever saw. But his feet were about that big. He could just go all  over the floor. That was really popular at school. But we also did a lot of  13  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  what you would call now ballroom dancing. The fellow I was pinned to  was quite a ballroom dancer. But there were several of the fellows that  would dance that way. They would twirl us out and then we   d come  back in, then we would    dip   . It was a beautiful dance and it was fun. It  made you feel very feminine. We also went to the Student Union a lot.  Also, at that time, you went into the   I don   t know what you   d call that  area where we danced. It had a juke box, and it was inside of course, but  then you could go across outside. I don   t think that   s available now. I  think they enclosed that part of the Student Union. But it was an outside  area where we had dances in the spring; I remember at least one dance  that we had in the spring out there on that   it seems like it was called     Starlight Terrace?  The Starlight Terrace. Yeah, that   s it. That was a lovely place for us to  dance. Then there was   oh you asked me this and I had forgotten all  about it. Out by the lake, what was the name of it? Help me.  Theta Pond.  No. Out north, not on campus.  Okay.  It was not at Blackwell. It was Sooner Lake. Didn   t we have a lake  named Sooner Lake?  Boomer?  Boomer Lake. It was Boomer. That was it. Boomer Lake. And maybe in  a minute I   ll think of the name that was kind of a little joint out there.  You could go out there and dance and they sold beer. I didn   t go there  very many times. I was probably kind of prudish. I didn   t think I was.  But in retrospect I probably was. But when I did go, I thought it was  kind of fun and daring.  And another thing about our etiquette, they told us in our pledge class,     Now if you smoke, you don   t ever smoke unless you have a roof over  your head. Ladies don   t smoke unless they   re seated.    And you don   t  smoke outside. It   s funny, isn   t it? They were giving us etiquette about  smoking and now none of us does. But I didn   t smoke when I was in  college because I had to protect my singing voice. But we always  thought it was kind of funny that they thought they could tell us all these  things to do, yet we could do whatever we wanted to. In our pledge  class, we had a pledge trainer, Shirley Smallstig, and she trained us well.  We had to learn the alphabet, the     14  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Greek alphabet?  The Greek alphabet. We had to learn that and we had to learn the history  of Kappa. We had a little test every once in a while. I   m sure all the  sororities did back them, I   m not sure about now. I   m still on the board  for the Kappa House and go over for meetings. I haven   t heard them  mention anything like that. But see then, we pledged clear until spring.  We pledged in the early fall, and then we were pledges still, I think, until  March. So really, the pledge class, we really got to know each other. We  had a lot of wonderful activities together.  And then of course we went on our sneak. We captured the pledge  trainer and two or three other members. We went down to Texhoma.  Lynn Crockett lived in Durant. She called it,    Doo-rant.    We went to her  house, took a bus and went down. It was a little inclement that weekend.  We really didn   t get to go out on the lake, we went to the lake, but we  didn   t really get to go out on it. But there were about   I think there were  33 in our pledge class. And we wrote a song.  We were always singing. Everybody in all the sororities. There was so  much music. We sang between our main course and our dessert at the  dinner. You see, we ate lunch together and we ate dinner together at all  the sorority houses. It is really unfortunate that they just aren   t ever  together very often anymore. I think they have one formal dinner a  month now. I don   t know how they do that now. But we had formal  dinner every Monday night and we were supposed to wear black. So we  had every shade of black there was. (Laughter)  Do you remember the house boys?  Yes.  Any notable house boys?  No, I never dated any of the house boys, but some of my good friends  did. Usually, we had quite a few Sigma Chi house boys cause that was  right next door. I must tell you what Sigma Chi   s used to do. They  would make their pledges at noon go out and do a rain dance so that they  wouldn   t have to go to ROTC that afternoon. We thought that was so  funny  So we would be eating our lunch like nice ladies do, don   t you  know. But as soon as we got through, we had kind of a balcony thing.  Not a balcony, a terrace outside. We would go outside and razz those  boys because they were having to do, as they would say the    damn rain  dance.    It seems like we had a lot of Sigma Chi and Beta houseboys.  You see Beta was right across the street west from us. House boys, oh  they were always great fun. Full of fun.  15  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  What do you remember about Homecoming?  Oh my goodness, I remember   and we still talk about it when we get  together. I have a group of about thirteen women who were in my pledge  class and we take a trip together every summer. Every year, so we have  remained really close. We still talk about that horrible gypsy. The idea  was the float was supposed to be this gypsy. I don   t remember what the  theme of the Homecoming was. But the main part of the float was  supposed to be her skirt, and then there was the gypsy. And we worked  on that thing. You know they used, I don   t know if they still do, but they  used chicken wire and they put all that crepe paper in it, you know. And  every minute, every waking hour here we were out working with that  crazy thing. Some boy had planned it for us and told us how it was going  to work   you know, how did we know? But we didn   t   then just the  sorority did their own and the fraternities did their own. They didn   t go  together. But we had friends. We had boyfriends that helped us plan. But  it was a disaster because it started raining. Her eyes (laughs)   it was the  worst looking thing you   ve ever seen in your life  And of course we  didn   t win. We thought it was terrible. The first year, the year I was a  pledge, the ad that was popular then was,    I dreamed I did (something)  in my Maiden Form bra.    That was the ad on television. And the  Kappas    house decorations,    I dreamed we beat Wyoming in our made-to-  form shoulder pads.    We thought that was so daring  I don   t  remember if we won or not, but I do remember that line and how daring  that we thought it was. So that was a fun thing at homecoming.  Always, always everybody had to have a mum. Your boyfriend brought  you the mum and you went to the football game and you dressed up.  You wore heals and hose, maybe a hat. We dressed up everywhere we  went. We never wore slacks, and I am saying slacks not jeans.  Jeans  were strictly for    hanging around the house      usually worn with a  sweatshirt or oversized men   s style shirt not tucked in.  We wore slacks  only if it were really, really snowy. Or maybe it had snowed and we  were having to walk to class or something. I do remember one time  being really, really cold and wearing slacks. But gosh by the time you  got to the class room you were so cold you left your coat on anyway.  But we wore dresses. We wore skirts. We wore lots of skirts and  sweaters. Matching colors, the skirt and the sweater would be dyed to  match. Cashmere and bobby socks, and angora   had angora tops on  them, and loafers. We wore loafers really more than we did saddle  oxfords. We wore those penny loafers.  Was there a certain dress code requirement?  No. We didn   t have a requirement. It was an unspoken rule. I don   t  remember anything about a dress code. I don   t think there was one. We  16  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  didn   t have a need for one then. The most daring thing as far as dressing  we ever did, it seems like the Pi Phi   s got these, a lot of them got these  haircuts. What were those haircuts called? They were shagged, they  called them the shag hair cut. Then of course a lot of the Kappa   s did  too. I did and my hair was pretty long at the time. It was just a real real  close hair cut. We thought it was cute. Then there was a poodle cut,  where you got a permanent and just were curls all over your head. That   s  about as daring as we got as far as dress code, you know.  The Sigma Nu   s had a big Frontier Ball, I wonder if they still do. They  had their big party in the fall. It was the Frontier Ball. Everybody  dressed up like cowboys. In the summer you kind of shopped for  whatever you were going to wear to the Frontier Ball. We wore jeans  and boots and fringe on our jackets. The guys let their beards grow  which we thought was shocking. But they let their beards grow and  became so masculine for the Frontier Ball. That was really a fun time for  us.  The Frontier Ball was held in the Student Union ballroom and was  open to anyone on campus.   Tell me about any memorable classes that you had.  Well, have I mentioned Mr. White   s class, already?  Humanities?  Humanities. Outside the music classes, Mr. White   s class   took it my  sophomore year. It was for students who had, I guess, a 3.5 or more. It  was a select class, I remember that. I had just taken a trip to Europe  when I graduated from high school. We went all over Europe for sixty  days. And this was so fresh on my mind. I grew up in Duncan, America  and so here my world   s getting bigger and bigger. That trip was the  perfect preface for this class, because everything we talked about, I had  been there. But Mr. White really was an intellectually stimulating  professor. We had all these kids in there that were used to studying hard  and so the kids in the class were as stimulating to the intellect as Mr.  White was. But he allowed us to have a lot of good interchange in that  class. I think Mr. White, I don   t believe he was a doctor. I believe not  long ago that I saw over at the Student Union where he had been voted  favorite professor or something back then. That was right after my time,  I guess, because that didn   t happen while I was there. But we all just  loved him. I think still to this day, that every freshman, regardless of  what they study, I think they should take humanities. It broadens your  perspective so much. It makes you realize who you are as an American,  essentially when you get right down to it. All those things led up to our  own country   s foundations   you know the Greek and the Roman law,  and all that. I loved him.  17  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Then I loved Cy Perkins. Cy was my private voice teacher for awhile  and he directed the Men   s Glee Club, see and I sang with them. Then he  directed my church choir, so I was with Mr. Perkins a lot because I did a  lot of solo singing. Cy wore a toupee, and back then I didn   t know a man  who wore a toupee, but we all knew Cy did. So one time on a trip we  went to Paris, Texas: the Men   s Glee Club and we three girls. We were  in this hotel in Paris, it was an old timey downtown hotel. Cy wore a hat.  Not a cowboy hat, just like a gentleman   s dress hat. He had laid his hat  over on the table upside down and some of those boys filled that hat  with sugar. So when Mr. Perkins put it on, we knew what was going to  happen. He never said a word. He never even acted like anything was  wrong, to this day. Well, you know whose goat that got, those boys. Just  thought they were going to have the biggest, grandest, most wonderful  trick in the world on him. Not Cy. He was too sharp for those boys. You  know, he had worked with boys forever. But that   s a sweet pleasant  memory of mine. That was so funny. Those boys thought they were big  time joke players and he got their goat. It was cute.  Outside of Paris, do you remember singing other places with the Glee  Club?  Oh, my. We   re going a long ways back now. That was my freshman  year. Well we did, Dr. Hairston I believe was the symphony   s director   s  name. The conductor of the Oklahoma City Symphony, I   m pretty sure  his name was Guy Frazier Hairston. He had a heart for the collegiate  music schools. He invited the Oklahoma University Glee Club choirs,  and our men   s choir. I don   t believe our symphonic choir went. But the  Glee Club would do a program every year with the Oklahoma City  Symphony. That was a wonderful experience. And, of course, we three  girls got to go, and the next year there were four of us or five. We did  that. And all of our parents came to Oklahoma City to hear us and we  got to meet the conductor. The conductor spoke with us and encouraged  us and gave us some real insights to the importance of music in our  lives. He wasn   t trying to make us professional musicians. But he was  reaching out to young singers and giving us encouragement. That was a  really wonderful, wonderful opportunity. I haven   t thought of it in many,  many years. You   re asking the right questions.  Well, that   s good. Did your parents visit much, or did you go home  much while you were in college?  Well, see Dad was still coming to the meetings, to the board meetings.  So Mother always came when he would come for a meeting and I would  always go and have lunch with them at the Union. I didn   t go home a lot.  It was about a three hour drive from Stillwater and the first year I didn   t  have a car. But Dad had a little Chevy Coup at the time-two door and I  18  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  would bring it back to school a lot. Well, I guess sometimes I would just  go home with them from the board meetings. But I didn   t particularly  want to go home a lot, I was so happy in school and I was involved in a  lot of activities. I volunteered for everything that came along I guess. I  really enjoyed lots of various activities. So I didn   t get homesick very  much.  But I do remember one time, I got really homesick all of a sudden that I  just   well you know how that feels. It   s a terrible feeling. All of a  sudden it just gripped me, I remember it well. I called and said I   m  coming home this weekend. By then I had my own car. I had my  convertible. I remember that when I got to the edge of Duncan, this  sounds crazy, I was so happy to get home, I started honking my horn  about two blocks before I got to our house. And then it was over. I was  fine, I was ready to go back, and that was over. I guess that   s the only  time I ever really experienced that horrible, horrible feeling. You don   t  want to be homesick. But I fixed it  I was able to go home. I didn   t go  home too much. My parents were there fairly often.  And they usually came to the games. Sometimes I sat with them and  sometimes I sat with my friends, because they had those fifty yard  tickets, and sometimes I didn   t want to be there. I   d rather be with the  kids.  Did you attend football, basketball, wrestling? Or just certain sports?  All the football games and almost all the basketball games. I never  attended a wrestling match until after we moved to Enid. And then I  didn   t understand anything that was going on. I was afraid those boys  were going to get hurt. But the basketball and the football, yes. All the  students   I mean all the ones I knew went to all the football games,  went to all the basketball games. Sometimes   you know the basketball  games would be during the week too, on weeknights. So we couldn   t go  to all those, we just had to study sometime. I don   t guess we went to all  those. But we went to all the football games and some of the out of town  games but not too many. Football wasn   t exactly fun and exciting when I  was at school. We would laugh and say,    Okay what   s our motto: wait     til next year.       (Laughter)  You must have been quite popular with a car.  Well, several of my friends had cars. But yes. I   ll tell you a funny car  story. My friends Naomi Lamb and Celia Wilkerson and I were all  music majors. We were all music majors, we were all Kappa   s and we  all went to Baptist church together. And this is not about my car, this is  about Naomi   s parent   s car. They had a two door Studebaker. Yellow.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  And they lived in Stillwater. So before I had my car, Naomi always had  a car. They lived very close to the campus. I don   t recall what business  her father was in, maybe he had another car   anyway she got that car a  lot. We always had all this music we were carrying around with us. I  mean you know that we just felt we had to   actually I don   t think there  was any place in Crutchfield to leave our belongings. There wasn   t for  us to keep our music, so we just had to carry it. We thought it look kind  of dorky to have a satchel. So here we were carrying the music.  I remember Naomi would pull up in that Studebaker. Celia would get in  the front, and I would get in the back. Every time I would get in the  back, they would turn and say,    Don   t step on the music. Don   t step on  the music.    So that kind of got to be our funny kind of deal. So wherever  we would be, we   d always say,    Don   t step on the music.    Because there  was always lots of music in the back of that car.  Just a few things to clarify before we move forward. You spoke earlier  about a sneak, and I believe that   s the first time we   ve heard of a sneak  so     Okay. Well, all the sororities did that at the time. I think the fraternities  did too. But a sneak was, you know, none of the members were  supposed to know that the pledge class was going to take a sneak. It was  a weekend, it was planned ahead and of course they had to make  arrangements for us to get a bus and everything. But they usually took  their pledge trainer and two other members that the pledge class really  wanted to take. In retrospect, I really think those three members must  have known it because we couldn   t go in and bodily kidnap them. But it  was a big fun thing.  We kidnapped them and made them get on the bus with us, and they  didn   t know where we were going. So then it was a whole weekend and  different pledge classes went different places. But Lynn Crockett was a  member of our pledge class and she invited us to come down to the  Durant. I remember staying in their house, it wasn   t a real large house  but we had such a good time there   all 33 of us  We made up a song, I  wish I could remember it now. On the way home on the bus, we made  up a song and later   I think that song, that melody was one that one of  the members already knew and so she just kind of helped us along.  Maybe the words, too. Maybe it was an old Kappa song. But we thought  it was our song. But all the sororities did that. It was usually   I would  say it was probably in November, maybe late October. But we had been  together long enough to where we knew each other pretty well. I think  there were about 33 in my class. That was lots of fun.  Now, earlier on you mentioned about singing with the Men   s Glee Club.  20  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Yes.  Tell me about the selection process to be chosen.  Okay. Well, I   m trying to think if I knew Mr. Perkins. I don   t know that  I had ever met Mr. Perkins before starting to school. But I was a music  major, we were all music majors. I had already been doing a lot of  singing earlier in high school and contests and all those things, and he  just asked me. I think he was kind of like how Bob Kerr was with Dad.  He just said,    Now you   ll be singing with the Glee Club, won   t you?     Pretty much, that   s kind of how it was. So there were Naomi and I. She  lived in Stillwater and went to his church, so he already knew she could  sing. She also was a really fine pianist, wonderful. Then the other little  girl   s name was Vaughndeen Dobbs. She lives in Tulsa now, and she  was a music major. So he had just heard us sing. I   m little, but I   m loud   (Laughter) We also sang with three other boys, we had a quintet. I don   t  remember if there were three or two boys that joined us. Our quintet did  some Four Freshmen arrangements. You don   t know who Four  Freshmen are but they were the top choice of college kids at that time.  They did real schmaltzy, real close close harmony. So we had some of  their arrangements and we did some of those when we went on tour.  One more question about your Glee Club days. How would you travel to  events?  We always went by bus. Some of the guys, like if they had to get back  for certain things might take their car. I don   t think Mr. Perkins ever  objected to that. Nowadays, we always have to be so careful about all  the legal aspects of everything. But we didn   t worry about things like  that then. I know there were some fellows that took their car. I  remember, I think it was when we came home from the concert with the  Oklahoma City Symphony, a Kappa friend of mine was married to Glen  Lemon. Helaine was her name, Helaine Wright Lemon. Glen had taken  his car down. I do remember that I rode home with Glen at one time,  rode back to Stillwater with him    cause I had to get back for Sunday  program or something, and he had to get back too. I do remember that he  gave me a ride back in his car. So some of the boys had to take their own  car. But we girls never did. We always rode on the bus with Mr. Perkins.  I remember that we went to lots of the high schools. I had kind of  forgotten that. We went to the high schools of the kids who were in the  Glee Club. We did a program in Duncan. Of course, you know that was  good advertising for the University, depending on how well we did on  the program that night. But anyway, yes we went all over the state like  that. And in the spring, we had so many concerts that I went from an A  in that political science class to a C. That   s my only C and I just thought  21  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  the world had ended. Isn   t that crazy now? But I did. Oh, my goodness. I  just could not get up and go to those eight o   clock classes every time  when we   d get home from those trips. So that was a little bit hard, but I  wouldn   t trade it for anything.  Was coffee drinking pretty popular on campus?  Yes. And smoking.  What are some of the places your remember being good coffee drinking  places?  Well, mainly, that Y-Hut, and the Student Union. And we, music majors,  there weren   t very many of us, and all kind of hung together. So as soon  as we got out of the theory class, we had to have theory class everyday  at nine o   clock. We went five days, but we only got four hours credit.  We would bail out of that theory class just wringing our hands and go  down to the Y-Hut, and drink coffee. Richard Snell, God love him, got  me through the theory class. I mean he   d go over with me and help me  get what was right. Later he married a Kappa too, and we still keep in  touch. But we drank coffee a lot. And there was lots of smoking, a lot of  smoking. I remember at the Kappa house, at noon after lunch the girls  would play bridge. They would sit on the floor and there was a coffee  table kind of about this size, and they would sit and play bridge and  smoke.  Smoking was allowed everywhere on campus except in the  classrooms.  But I never did because I always had to go to another class.  I didn   t learn to play bridge until I got out of college. But I remember  Mary Drummond was a wonderful bridge player. I remember they   d  play bridge every day right after lunch.  Well, tell me a little bit about graduation.  Graduation   I think it was, like almost every year it seemed like it was  on Mother   s Day weekend. I don   t know if it was the year I graduated or  not. Even though Dad was not president of the board that year, he sat on  the platform with the other Regents. Celia and Naomi, whom I   ve  already mentioned, were all music majors, so we were sitting together.  So when we went up to receive our diploma, Dad stepped forth and gave  each of us our diploma and a kiss. That was so endearing. They had all  been in my home, and you know we were the three musketeers  practically. We were just almost inseparable. And Dad loved them too.  So that was a very happy memory about my own graduation.  Our class  of 1957 was the last class of OAMC; the next year it was OSU.   Did your mother attend?  22  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  No. I think Mother just had an eighth or ninth grade education too.  Maybe that   s why both of them believed so strongly in the importance of  going to school, of going to college. I love to go to school. I would love  to be taking classes now but I don   t want to take any more tests. No  more tests. But I really do enjoy going to school, learning.  Now your father received the Henry Bennett Award in 1978.  Yes.  Did you attend that ceremony?  Oh, absolutely.  Tell me a little bit about it.  A bunch of our family attended: my two nephews and their wives;  myself, my husband, Dr. Don Gooch and our three children, Donald,  Clayburn, and Allison; mother   s sisters, two or three of her sisters. It  was a wonderful evening. They had a beautiful dinner before the  ceremony at the Union. We all had dinner, and they honored Dad at that  dinner. Then we went over to the stadium for the graduation. When they  made the presentation to Dad   here   s my sweet little daddy. And he   s  got on this robe and mortar board, you know. His legs were just a little  bowed. I told you he was a cowboy, but they really were just a little  bowed. Here he was   and he had on kind of a light tan suit. So here  these little cowboy legs out from under that robe. I will never forget it.  I   ve got some pretty good pictures of it. But when he went to accept the  award, he thanked them of course but then he didn   t talk about himself,  he talked about Dr. Bennett. About what a wonderful friend he   d been. I  remember in his remarks he said,    He was a friend to me, and a real  friend to this University.    It was very touching, and very brief. He never  thought of himself as a public speaker, when in reality he was a great  communicator  That was one of his modest sides.  But he made a very touching, moving talk about Dr. Bennett and also, as  a little side, Dad   s niece who was grown, married, had her children, had  gone back to college there. They lived in Stillwater. Her name was  Marjorie Shaw and her daughter Pat Gwin still lives in Stillwater as well  as her son Rusty Shaw. They all went to college at OSU. Marjorie had  gone back to college and gotten her Master   s Degree, and that was the  night she got that degree, the night that Daddy got that award, and of  course all of her family was there. It was a love feast. It really was. It  was just a shining moment for all of our family. Of course everyone was  so proud of Daddy and loved him so much. He had always kind of been  a pillar in Mother   s family. She had these four sisters and they all just  23  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  loved and admired Dad so.  I   m sure he felt really honored since he had such great respect   .  Oh, yes.     for President Bennett.  Yes. He was surprised and honored. At that time, there was a gentleman  on the board who was the originator from the Velma area. He was a  rancher and had known Dad forever. Of course, he was a lot younger  than Dad  and I think he thought of Dad as a mentor, both as a fellow  rancher and a former board member. His name is Ed Ketchum and he is  a dear family friend to this day.   Now, you told me kind of a neat story about your husband   s diploma  before we started taping today.  Yes.  Tell me about your husband   s diploma.  Well, I was married to Dr. Don Gooch, a 1955 graduate of Oklahoma  A M and he did his internship and residency in Houston. We decided to  move back to Oklahoma because we wanted our children to be Okies  and know their grandparents. His parents lived in Guthrie and mine still  lived in Duncan. When we got out all of his diplomas to frame them and  put in his office. Here was his Oklahoma A M College diploma. There  was Dad   s name. My dad had signed Don   s diploma the year he was  president of the board and we never knew it of course until we got that  diploma out. Dad was still living then, and he was like,    Well, what do  you know, I guess I picked a good one,    he said to Don. (Laughter) I can  still remember sitting in the office and taking this stuff out of the box,  you know we had just moved up here. We   d never had that diploma  framed, you see. So here we were getting ready to frame it. The  decorator said,    You need to have these framed in certain colors    and all  that stuff. So that   s how that all happened. It was a wonderful surprise.  Now you   re family really bleeds OSU orange.  Oh, yes.  How many generations? How many in your family have attended?  Well I counted seventeen   at least seventeen that I know of for sure.  Nieces and nephews and me and my   I mean Dad   s nieces and  24  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  nephews, one of his grandsons, and his granddaughter, my daughter  Allison. And then I just went on down the list and I    oh yeah, oh yeah.    I  was just amazed at how many there were. Just sitting here, I think I  thought of a couple more. But yes, he did have an influence in that  regard. However, my son went to Baylor and he just jokes,    Momma,  I   m sorry I   m just a traitor.     Well what is it about Oklahoma State that sparks such loyalty in alumni  and students?  What is it about Oklahoma State? There is something. It   s almost  tangible, isn   t it?  Mm-hmm.  When I   m over there, I feel it. I   m aware of the   I don   t think you   d call  it an aura, but it   s there. It   s something that   actually, you know what,  it   s not like they drilled it into us, but when you were there you just felt  like it was the best place in the world to be. You don   t forget those  feelings. Those kinds of feelings remain with you. I mean, forever I  think. Possibly I think the loyalty is based on   well I   m sure it is, it   s  based on those wonderful experiences we had while we were on the  campus. Not only educationally, but socially. Most of us, our faith grew  while we were there. All of the denominations had student centers then,  do they now? I don   t know if they still do.  A handful.  I know the Methodists I think do. I know where theirs is, I noticed it.  And the Baptist, they   ve changed the name of it. It was called the BSU  when I was there, the Baptist Student Union. I think it has a different  name now. A lot of the people I knew, maybe not most, but almost all  the people I knew, in my circle took part in those student centers. So we  grew. Our faith grew too. And we made these lifelong friends. And you  know if you have an allegiance to something and your friend does too  then that just strengthens that allegiance and there   s just something  magic about it. I hope other universities share the same thing. That their  alums feel the same way we do. But that   s how we feel.  Well, before we end the interview, is there anything else that you would  like to add that we have failed to ask you? Anything else you would like  to mention about your father?  One of the things that Dad always said was,    Let your word be your  bond.    I know that   s an old saying among people his age, but I felt that  that was how all the men on that board felt. They were individuals  25  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  Nykolaiszyn  Gooch  before they got there, but when they got there, they worked hard. They  worked together,  and after Dr. Bennett   s death, Dad really enjoyed  working with Dr. Willham and Dr. Boger.  And you can see what they  accomplished. He liked to say,    After all, I   m just an old cowboy.    Then  he   d be in his suit, or like when he received that award and he had on  that graduation cap and gown. He came a long ways.  Recently I saw a documentary on Bob Kerr. You know Bob Kerr was  born in a log cabin; Dad was born on a farm. Dad did not have any  education to speak of. That   s never going to happen again, not now. No  one with so little formal education is ever going to be considered to  serve on a university board   and that   s fine. That   s the way it should be.  But when you think of all the things that he experienced in his life,  mostly positive   I   m really glad you   re doing this interview about him.  Because I think he was a very, very unique individual. That   s my bias,  but correct opinion. But I appreciate you doing this interview about Dad.  I know he would be so pleased. When I go back to the University and  Althea Wright, my friend, drives me around the University and shows  me all the things that are happening, I know he   s smiling.  Absolutely.  I know he is. I know he   s saying,    That a boy. Go for it. Think big, we  can do it.    That was always his attitude. Help the underdog, and get  better as you go. That was his attitude.  Well, we appreciate your time today helping us to preserve his memory  and also learning about your time on campus.  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I enjoyed it. Again, thank you very much for giving me this opportunity.  Sorry for the tears.  -------  -------
