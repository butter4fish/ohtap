WILLIAMS:	OK, I’m Bethy Williams, Class of 2013, and I’m here with Eleanor Woods, Class of 1961.  Thank you for agreeing to be part of this project.

WOODS:	I’m happy to do it.

WILLIAMS:	Would you mind spelling your name for us?

WOODS:	E-L-E-A-N-O-R C. Woods, W-O-O-D-S.

WILLIAMS:	Thank you.  So, how did you choose Smith?

WOODS:	I chose Smith because I was very interested in being a violinist, and Smith had an excellent music department, and I did not want to go to a conservatory.  I wanted a liberal arts education, in addition to majoring in music.

WILLIAMS:	So, given the options, why did you choose a women’s college?

WOODS:	As far as I was concerned, to go to an excellent school for women in the Northeast, for the most part, I felt Smith was a good choice.

WILLIAMS:	And when you were here, were you part of music organizations like the orchestra or other things like that?

WOODS:	I played in the orchestra.  I played in a string quartet.  I played a senior recital.  I also played a violin and viola Mozart Sinfonia  Concertante in the last concert.

WILLIAMS:	Did you continue on with music after graduation?

WOODS:	I’m still doing it!  I have done it since I graduated from Smith.  I perform and play.  Perform, play, and teach.

WILLIAMS:	Wow, that’s great.  What house did you live in at Smith, and what part did your house play in your overall experience here?

WOODS:	Actually, I started out in Haven House.  But my roommate and I were intrigued with the other women in Lamont, and it was a lottery, at that point, and she got a very low number.  So we chose -- we knew we wanted to be in Lamont.  So we moved to Lamont for sophomore year, and were there for three years.  And I chose the house because I knew some of the people there, and really related to them.

WILLIAMS:	And you told me you’re still in touch with those women, correct?

WOODS:	Absolutely (laughs).

WILLIAMS:	Still really good friends.

WOODS:	Yes.

WILLIAMS:	Did you have any particular professors or mentors that inspired you while here?

WOODS:	Mostly, I would say, what made the biggest influence -- that played the biggest role in my life was Gabriel Banat, who came up from the New York Philharmonic and gave violin lessons here.  And so, in terms of individual teachers, I would say he probably impacted my life more.  I played in the orchestra, and I got– I was given an opportunity there to do solos with the orchestra, so I felt that (Marianne Durand?) at that point certainly gave me a role to play.  And I took courses from Alvin Etler, who was the Composition teacher at that point; that was interesting.  However, I’ve not done a lot of composing myself since I graduated.

WILLIAMS:	Here’s an interesting question.  What were your experiences with relationships and dating while here?

WOODS:	Mostly, I dated boys from Amherst.  In fact, I had a long-term relationship with one for a while.  I didn’t continue it, but–

WILLIAMS:	Was it difficult to find Amherst boys?

WOODS:	Not really.

WILLIAMS:	There was a lot of them.

WOODS:	Yeah.  They would come to the house and they’d look at the magazine, “Who’s Who.”  Do you still have a “Who’s Who”?

WILLIAMS:	I don’t think so (laughs).

WOODS:	“Who’s Who” is a picture of all the freshmen.  I mean, their high school pictures are in the “Who’s Who.”  And so, they’d come in and ask for somebody.  They’d come -- because we all had watch, and they’d ask the person at watch for a name that they’d seen in the “Who’s Who.”  And hope to go out with them.  And really a funny story -- my picture was really rather attractive as a high school student.  And I was on watch, and they came in and asked for me by name, and they wanted to know if I would get that person.  And when I said that I was that person, they said, “Oh.” (laughs) They were surprised.

WILLIAMS:	And did you have those -- I’ve heard a lot about posture pictures.  Did you have to do that or was that --

WOODS:	Yes!  We had to do posture pictures!

WILLIAMS:	How did you feel about them?

WOODS:	You know, my generation was very amenable.  And if you had to do posture pictures, we did posture pictures.  I didn’t rebel about it, and I guess how well you stood when you went in for it, they told you what basic motor skills you had to improve.  And I did some basic motor skills...but anyway, it was crazy!

WILLIAMS:	But it was OK?

WOODS:	I didn’t object at the time.  Now I think it’s ridiculous!

WILLIAMS:	We don’t have to do it anymore.

WOODS:	Right!

WILLIAMS:	So, you were at Smith at a time when they were admitting a significant larger amount of women of color.  Do you remember that, or were you friends with any of these women, or would you agree with that statement?

WOODS:	I think there were very few blacks in our class.  Very few.  And it’s interesting, because we live in DC.  My husband’s been at Howard University for 41 years -- he’s retired now -- so we have associated with a lot of black families.  But at the time, I didn’t find it– I mean, I didn’t really think about it.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  So there wasn’t much interaction between white and black students --

WOODS:	Definitely not.  No.


WILLIAMS:	And at Smith, did you hear about sort of the early civil rights movement?  Like, the stuff that was happening in the South, particularly?

WOODS:	It happened after I was in college for a while, and some did go down to the South.  I did not.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  And what were Smithies doing down in the South?

WOODS:	I have no idea what they did.

WILLIAMS:	(laughs) So, do you remember the controversy of Smith firing Professors Newton Arvin, Edward Spofford, and Joel Dorius?

WOODS:	Uh, yes.

WILLIAMS:	And what was that controversy like?  What was campus like during that time?

WOODS:	I wasn’t there at the time.  It was after I graduated.

WILLIAMS:	It was after you graduated.

WOODS:	Yeah.  What was the name– Alvin– the first name you mentioned?

WILLIAMS:	Newton Arvin.

WOODS:	Because of being homosexual?

WILLIAMS:	Right.

WOODS:	And we– we alumnae were upset about it, because basically what one does in private life, I think, is up to the individual and shouldn’t be invaded.  Now, I don’t remember the details.  I don’t think he was involved with students in any way.

WILLIAMS:	No.  So was there an outcry of alumnae– were they– how did alumnae react?  Did they take any action?

WOODS:	I didn’t take any action.  I remember talking to a classmate who taught at the University of Illinois, and she was upset about it also.

WILLIAMS:	So do you think overall– do you think Smith during your time was an accepting place for those who might be considered outsiders, like Jews or blacks or homosexuals or whatever?

WOODS:	That’s really interesting.  At the time, I didn’t even think about who was Jewish.  And yet, I have classmates who were Jewish who felt like they– that people did things to them that was not right.  And I was unaware of it!  I didn’t think that they were any different.  So I was a little naïve, I think, of not being sensitive to where they might be.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  So, you think overall Smith was pretty accepting or diverse?

WOODS:	More than anything else, I don’t know anything about the faculty and what they felt.  In terms of my class, I never heard anybody malign anybody who was different.

WILLIAMS:	So, let’s talk a little bit about your life after Smith, because it sounds like you’ve been really involved with the college after graduating.

WOODS:	Mm-hmm.

WILLIAMS:	What did you expect as a Smith graduate in terms of marriage and family and work?  What were you–

WOODS:	In other words, what were my goals after college?

WILLIAMS:	Right.  And what do you think you were expected to do as a Smith graduate?

WOODS:	I knew, when I graduated, that I wanted to be involved in music.  I also knew that I probably wanted to teach.  And I also knew that at some point, I wanted to be married.  So–

WILLIAMS:	Have it all (laughs).

WOODS:	Have it all.  And in some ways, I have had it all.  I think Smith was the right choice as far as where I wanted to go to school and what it gave me, because I did want an education where I knew about things other than music.  And I was lucky in finding a husband who also loved music, although that’s not his field.  And we have very similar values.  And I felt lucky there also.  I think, in my class, I may be a small percentage who knew what they wanted to do when they got out of school.  But for me, I did know what I wanted to do.  And after I left, I went and got an MAT in music at Yale.  So– and it was a new program, so I was kind of a guinea pig in terms of the program that they developed with the music school at Yale.

WILLIAMS:	Wow!  So, so you don’t think your life after Smith has really strayed from your original plan.

WOODS:	It definitely did not.

WILLIAMS:	That’s impressive!  Looking back, would you encourage a younger woman like your daughter or someone else to go to Smith?

WOODS:	I tried to get my daughter to go to Smith.  To her, it made a huge difference that it wasn’t co-ed, even though they had buses going to other schools.  She still– and it was a beautiful day when she saw Smith, and they talked about the busing that they had to the other schools, but she said, “It’s still single-sex.”  So she didn’t apply– no, I don’t think she even applied to Smith.  And I think, because in her generation, there were other options because of all the schools that had become co-ed.

WILLIAMS:	But you tried to get her to go (laughs).

WOODS:	I certainly mentioned it, yeah.

WILLIAMS:	What do you think a typical Smithie is like now?

WOODS:	Open-minded.  Someone who is easy to talk to.  Someone that has something worthwhile to say.

WILLIAMS:	And do you think that was true of your class and your generation as well?

WOODS:	Yes.

WILLIAMS:	So, I just wanted to ask a little bit about your involvement with the Alumnae Association.  If you could just tell me what you’ve done with your class and things like that.

WOODS:	OK.  I have not done much with the local Smith club in DC.  I have done a lot with my class.  I was President of my class up to the 40th reunion.  I have kept in touch with a lot of classmates.  We in Lamont have had many reunions in between.  So I feel -- I feel close to my class.

WILLIAMS:	So why have you chosen to stay so involved with Smith?  What do you love about Smith that makes you want to keep working for–

WOODS:	I care about the women.

WILLIAMS:	So, what difference has your Smith education meant to you?  How do you think it’s changed your life, coming to Smith?

WOODS:	Well, it offered me just the kind of education I wanted.  I continued to take lessons, and I’ve gotten very involved with the music community in Washington, DC.  And there’s a lot of music going on in Washington, DC.  So, I mean, all that– it wouldn’t have been possible.  And also, I feel I’m what you would call a liberal arts violin teacher.  I try to broaden them in terms of not just playing violin, but knowing about the music world, and what the composers were like, and when they lived, so that they have a broader concept of what music is, rather than just the discipline of trying to learn a music.

WILLIAMS:	And did you get that kind of education at Smith with music?

WOODS:	Well, I got that from the other courses I was taking at Smith, not from the lessons I was taking.  They were more on working on my technique, but I took a lot of music courses, because I majored in music.

WILLIAMS:	Right.  So you think Smith prepared you to be the teacher you are now.

WOODS:	No question.

WILLIAMS:	So, as sort of a wrap-up question -- we’re almost out of time -- do you have any advice for current and future Smithies like myself?

WOODS:	Go for your dream!  And if you know what you want to do, go for it, because I think the biggest challenge in our lifetime is to try to find something that feeds your soul.  And, in doing so, it’s wonderful if you can make a difference in the lives of somebody else.

WILLIAMS:	Thank you very much for this interview.

WOODS:	I enjoyed it.

GEIS:	(unclear) tack on something on at the end just to–

WILLIAMS:	Oh.

GEIS:	I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about as you were applying to Smith, what were your family’s expectation of you going to college?  What was your family history with college, going to college?  What did– what did Smith mean to you in your mind at the time?  What was the reputation that it had?  And tell us the year that you were looking as well, at the school.

WOODS:	The year that–

GEIS:	The year that you would have been looking.  It would have been 19–

WOODS:	I graduated in ’57.  In terms of the goal of my family, my father had gone to school during the Depression and couldn’t finish because of money, but education was a huge part of his life, and he certainly wanted education for me.  So my family was very supportive of me going to college.  And there was a Smith Club in my town, in which I grew up, and they interviewed me, and they knew, of course, of my violin playing, and I think my violin playing was a huge factor in getting into Smith, too, because I’m sure they look at a lot of people and they look for something which is unusual about each person.  So, I feel that my violin playing played a big life in my life at Smith, too.

WILLIAMS:	Had other women in your family gone to college?

WOODS:	I was the oldest, and I had a younger brother.

WILLIAMS:	Did your mother and your grandmother go to college?

WOODS:	No.  My mother is Danish– came from Denmark, and she had gone just up to high school, but at that point, her family couldn’t pay for it.  So she came to this country, because she felt that there was more opportunity in this country.  I think she was bright, but at that point, going to college was not an option.  My brother also went to college.

WILLIAMS:	I bet they were very proud of you all.

WOODS:	I would say so.  My family was proud.  Yeah.

GEIS:	Do you recall any conversations with your mother, or any kind of– do you have any feeling of how she felt about you being here?

WOODS:	I don’t remember my mother saying anything about me being here.  I remember my father -- he came back for Father’s Weekend -- and I think he was very moved to be there.  It meant a lot to him for me to be here.

GEIS:	I have one last question.  It’s just sort of– if you think about your life and the role that Smith played in your life, in terms of shaping the perspective of who you are or your opportunities in life, anything that kind of gives us a sense of what role this college played in your life?  Do you think about– since you’re still involved with the college, and you have a lot of friends that you’re still connected to, what overall sense do you get of being here and where Smith fits into your life, in shaping the person you were as a student or a violin player and–

WOODS:	Oh, I think Smith played a huge role in my–

GEIS:	Can you talk about–

WOODS:	Yeah.  Smith played a huge role, because, I mean, it was just what I needed in terms of being an educator as well as a violin player and teacher.  So, for me, Smith really gave me the education that I needed to do what I’m doing still.

WILLIAMS:	And the network of women as well, correct?

WOODS:	And that network of women, also, which is also important to me.  I mean, I don’t feel I am just a violinist, and I don’t feel I’m just a friend to Smith.  I’m all of the above.  So I feel that Smith really gave me both.  It gave me wonderful friends, and it gave me the music world.
