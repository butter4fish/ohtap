 Finchum  Bize  Today is March 29, 2010. My name is Tanya Finchum, I   m with  Oklahoma State University Library and we   re conducting an oral  history project featuring the Centennial farm families of Oklahoma.  Today we   re in Edmond with Ms. Susan Bize. We   re going to learn a  little about the Nordstrom Farm, so thank you for having us today.  Thank you.  Let   s start by having you tell us how your family came to own the  property, initially.  My great-grandfather, Gustav Nordstrom, had emigrated from Sweden a  couple years prior to the Run of 1889. He was living up in Illinois and  when he heard about the Run, he thought this would be a great  opportunity. He was a farmer by trade in Sweden and when he came  here, he went to Purcell on the train, took the train north from Purcell, to  participate in the Run. He got off the train at the Edmond Depot and ran  due west until he found the creek that is the perimeter of the property  and decided this would be perfect for farming. Plus, he   d also have some  wild game, hopefully. So he found a flag in the center and decided this  was his, so he stayed there and he actually called his brother Charlie,  who was living still in Illinois, to come down and they purchased  acreage just east of here, so then they had the 320  acres  to farm.  And then my future great-grandmother came separately with her brother  and she homesteaded 160 acres west of here with her brother with a  contiguous property of 160 acres. They farmed that for I guess the  requisite five years to get clear title and went to Guthrie, got their title to  the property and continued farming. I guess it was about eight years after  the original 1889 homestead days and Gustav and his future bride, Clara  Blades, married. I didn   t realize it, but apparently you had to give up  your claim as a married woman because I found in the deed records that  5  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Nykolaiszyn  Bize  Finchum  Bize  she transferred title to him. Not as joint tenants, but as his ownership.  She switched her property with her brother so they had the 320 and for  awhile they actually farmed 640 acres around here. They lived here until  they passed away. She passed away in    I guess he passed away in    43  and she passed away in    53. My grandmother was born here and my  mother was actually born here, too. Stayed in the family and it was  actually rented out from the    50s until my parents moved here in    82.  Was your mother the only child?  Yes. My great-grandparents had three, my grandmother and her sister  and then a sibling who was about seven years younger.  And they chose not to stay?  They left. I guess the son moved to Western Oklahoma. The older  daughter  was  my grandmother. The younger moved to Texas. She  married a guy in Texas and went there, so my grandmother stayed here.  My grandmother continued to work with her parents here.  What were some of the early things that they farmed?  They did oats I believe and I actually have the transcript that Gustav did  for the, I guess it was the Edmond Historical Society, and he said their  first crop was kaffir corn (I   m not sure what that is) and potatoes and  oats. And then they bought chickens and apparently they had hogs and  had livestock and a blacksmith shop. I know they also had a vineyard,  because Gustav made his own wine. He liked to have that on occasion  and they had an orchard in the back. So they were pretty self sufficient.  Did they have to work outside the farm?  No, they worked on the farm totally.  Money came from other sources?  Nope, they were totally self sufficient.  Did they have education, higher education?  No, I don   t believe they ever had any schooling beyond    Now Gustav,  when he came here was twenty-six. So he had gone through these  schools in Sweden, had done his military service before he moved here.  Clara, I don   t know if she had anything beyond the requisite education,  she came from Kansas. Now my grandmother, Myrtle, the oldest  daughter, actually was educated at the normal school, which is now part  6  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  of UCO. The original building that was built on the UCO campus was  Old North, and that was built, I guess, shortly after 1889. Gustav had his  binoculars and would stand on the hill and look to see, on Old North, the  time of day so he could set his clocks.  (Laughs) Interesting.  It   s kind of fun because my dad went to the same, which was Central  State, and then I got to teach there, so we get to continue a family  tradition.  Where did they go to elementary school, your grandmother and her  siblings?  My grandmother went to Higby, which I believe is torn down.  And that would have been how far from     Well, she actually rode a horse there, so I   m not sure how far that would  have been; a few miles probably.  The reason I asked, we passed the territorial school on the way in. So I  wondered     Right. That, unfortunately, was not there when she attended.  It   s not too far from here   It would have been fun  (Laughter) Yes, because I worked on the  committee that was putting that back together.  Well, talk a little bit about what you know of the buildings that were on  the farm.  Let me show you something, just one second    Here is a picture I found  of the farmhouse and the outbuildings with the barn we had originally.  Mom had actually created a graph to show you what we had: the  farmhouse, your upper story, and then the chicken coop, blacksmith  shop, barn, milk cows, and of course the outdoor toilets, his and hers.  (Laughs) They had two?  They had two, his and hers.  They had a chicken house and a potato bin and I   m assuming the cellar  was     7  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Underneath the house, right, and that   s where they stored the meat and  the preserves and that sort of thing. That was their refrigeration.  So they were gifted with being able to do repairs themselves?  Yes, they did everything.  Interesting the distance, the men   s     I thought that was kind of cute, the men had to go further than the  women. (Laughs)  Quite a bit further from the house itself, but maybe not where they were  doing most of their daily work?  Exactly, and here are some of the stories that Mom had typed up, saying  that Grandpa   s (which is Gustav) first house was a dugout. It was on the  west side of the creek there clumped with trees at the base of a small  knoll. And he then made a lean-to and used the creek for washing and  bathing. Then town, it says, was three miles across the prairie on foot, so  the horse was one of the first items they actually purchased. I remember  Clara did sell eggs, so they did sell out of the farm, but the eggs were  additional revenue. It said that fish and game were very plentiful.  One of the things I thought was kind of interesting was how they did the  harvest. Because this was all vegetation, in fact, now we do have hay.  Some of the hay is beginning to come back, so we have a friend who  comes out and helps us bale. By the harvest, apparently Gustav could  figure out how many bushels per acre by looking at one of the heads and  if it had thirty-nine grains it would be thirty-nine bushels per acre, which  I guess was fairly accurate. My mother actually used to go out and help  with the harvest, and she thought that was so fun because she could go  out and take water to the guys when they were out working in the field.  Then they had a bell and a pole that they would ring and, of course, the  women were all in, cooking. I guess it took most of the morning to cook  for the lunch meal and then the guys would come in at the appropriate  time to do that. One of the things, maybe I could read you a little bit of  that?  Sure, go ahead.  One of the things that she said, at lunch time, all the women were in the  kitchen and they had seats under the trees in the back, although most of  the trees unfortunately are now gone, the ice  storms  has gotten rid of a  lot of them. They   d have wash basins hanging from the limbs and a roll  of towels so that they could wash up. They had radishes, carrots, fried  8  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  chicken, fresh baked bread and hot pies. So they had some pretty heavy  (laughs) lunches, but they were doing a lot of work. I think that   s about  the extent of that.  I noticed that in this picture they had a windmill for their water.  Yes, and actually that was just to the left. The original well is not  producing anymore, so actually we are on a well, but it   s a few feet in  from the original. But that   s where the windmill was for the original  well.  Do you have any recollection of when electricity came to the farm?  No, I actually don   t know that.  Do you know roughly when this particular house was built?  That was probably built in early, like 1901. Originally it was just one  room and then they expanded on and doubled it and they added the  upstairs when the kids came along. My grandmother was born in    98, so  that would be in the early 1900s when they built the upper storey.  Do you remember spending any time in the house, yourself?  No, unfortunately I was a little too young at that point. I do remember  that it seemed a lot bigger than it was. It was torn down probably in the  late    60s because the tenants had pretty much destroyed it, but it was a  lot smaller than I remembered as a child. (Laughs) The thing that I  remember about it too was that it was very cool. Probably because it   s  up on the hill and the wind is pretty heavy around here, and it had the  front porch and the doors and windows that could be open and have a  nice breeze through. So it always seemed kind of cool. The cellar was  definitely cool, very damp and well for preserving everything.  They had a big garden and they kept it full?  Yes.  Did your mother can much?  Yes. In fact, when I was a little girl, my grandmother, my mother and I  were all canning. (Laughs) That was a tradition that we carried through,  even when my grandmother moved off the farm when she got older and  after my mother was born. My mother was an only child, so we have a  very small family, and lived in Edmond. At that point, I remember when  I was a little girl, she would still carry the tradition of canning and come  9  Nykolaiszyn  Bize  Nykolaiszyn  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  out to the farm and get all of the    The orchard, I guess the only thing  left of the orchard is the one poor pear tree, which has only two branches  left now.  Take us through the canning process.  My complaint about it was that it was always conducted in the summer,  when it was really hot. (Laughter) The thing I remember the most was  boiling everything, so you   d have big tubs of various, probably--I think  it was mainly pears and I don   t remember all the other    Grapes I don   t  remember, but pears I remember a lot of, and peaches. Those were the  main things that we were canning. And melting the wax and getting it  just right so that the wax would sit on those little mason jars that you  could screw them on, without the wax getting too much and coming over  and closing the jars. Most of my task was stirring. Because I was  probably about five at the time, I was not proficient enough to do any of  the actual canning, other than stirring the pots and making sure  everything was in order. But you   d have to sterilize all the cans first  before you could boil the fruits and put them in.  What other traditions do you remember them showing you in your  childhood?  Actually, this wasn   t one I participated in, but my mother did, was  making hats and purses from straw. They would take the leftover straw  from the field and soak it and braid it into hats that they actually wore,  so I still have one that Mom made when she was a teenager with my  grandmother or great-grandmother. The thing I remember, too, is all the  clothes were handmade, sometimes out of feed sacks or when they got  more material they would make all their clothes out of that. My  grandmother was always sewing. Pretty much everyone in the family  except me was a great cook. I have lost that gene (laughs) somehow, but  I remember my grandmother always cooking and then my mom was also  a very good cook.  You mentioned homemade bread.  Oh, yes. Everything was done fresh from scratch and then the quilts, you  can see some quilts over there that my grandmother made. That was  something they always liked and my mother talked about, since they  didn   t have central heat when she was young, that you would sleep in  the bed and they   d heat up a brick and put in the bottom of the bed to  keep it warm and pile quilts on top of you to stay warm.  Mighty cold, getting dressed for school in the mornings.  10  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Nykolaiszyn  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  That   s what I can   t imagine. I now see why they didn   t shower or bathe  every day because it would be really cold in the winter. (Laughter)  Now if they did that, when they did shower and bathe?  Just your once-a-week before you go to Sunday service, which is when  they would dress up. They would heat on the stove, the big kettles of  water, pour it into a tub and then take the lye soap. Actually there is  some soap berry trees by the creek so they were able to use those for  soap in the early days.  I   m not familiar with that tree.  Yes, it has little round berries and when you squish them up, they   re  kind of a soapy cleansing texture. They   re literally soap berries. It   s kind  of strange. (Laughs)  Going back to food, what are some foods that you remember or you can  recall your mother talking about?  Everything was fried. That   s the thing that I remember. I guess because  the ovens were pretty much used for bread and pies, so all the meats  were fried, fish was always fried and I remember potatoes were a real  pain because you had to boil them and peel them and mash them. The  thing I remember most is how much hard work it was to make a meal  because they had no conveniences. The women had to be pretty strong to  do that. And, of course, churning the butter and everything. I remember  Mom talking about going to the chicken house to get the eggs and the  chickens weren   t very pleased about her coming in and taking their eggs.  Everything was very fresh, but very labor intensive.  And for their meat, how did they   ?  They butchered, they had hogs and chickens and when the chickens got  too old they became food. (Laughs) But apparently once a year they   d  have a big butchering of the hogs. Mom talked about they would cure  the meat by smoking it and then actually hanging it in the house from  the rafters to let it dry and cure. She talked about sometimes Gustav  would go by and just cut off a little slice for a snack.  (Laughter) Do you remember them discussing their first tractor?  No, because most of the discussion I heard from my grandmother was  the plow with the horse and walking behind that. I can   t imagine how  much work that was. I did find out in the barn a scythe that Gustav had  made just from the wood and metal that he had then forged. Apparently  11  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Charlie was the one that was really good with metal and doing the  blacksmithing. That was his brother and he never married, so he lived  with him his whole life. He was also the one who took care of the  animals, so Gustav was better at the farming and he was in charge of all  of the crops and that sort of thing, so they had a little division of labor.  Clara was in the house doing all the home maintenance and cooking.  And to take their products to market, did they go to Oklahoma City or to  Edmond?  Edmond. Everything was in Edmond and apparently a road was  developed not too long after that, just a dirt road. Which is right down  there, Edmond Road was the road that they used to take everything.  And how often would they go into town?  I think they went in once a week for church service and that was really  the only time they would go in or if they needed to buy anything, some  fabric and that sort of thing.  Did they ever do cotton?  No, they didn   t. I am not sure where the cotton was actually grown?  It may not have been this far     I don   t think it was around this part because I don   t think the climate  was    the soil is not that great right here because it   s clay. So it   s hard  to grow a lot. In fact, my other great-grandfather, which was my  mother   s father   s father, homesteaded, also. His area could only grow  turnips, so they didn   t keep that property for the full time. But with the  creek, it had a lot more potential here, but again it was pretty much hay  and wheat and that sort of thing.  It started out as 160 and went up to 6-something and then     640.  And where is it currently?  Sixty.  And the other is   ?  Yes, in fact the addition to the right was sold probably in the mid-   70s  and then the addition to the west of us was sold in the late-   70s, early-  12  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize     80s. And then Mom and Dad kept the sixty in the middle.  So you   re surrounded by development?  Exactly. That   s the problem with the creek, because the creek used to be  high enough that Mom told stories about ice skating on it in the winter,  and they fished all the time. Now, it   s a few inches deep, because all the  development has pretty much dammed up the creek and there   s not  much left, but there   s enough so that we have still the wild turkey and  the deer.  Any ponds?  No.  They didn   t have any made during the summer   ?  No, they just used the creek for that.  Did they participate in any of the soil conservation efforts early on?  I am not sure. I know that they made it through the Depression time  without a problem, so I guess they were doing enough rotation of the  crops. And since Gustav had grown up in a farming community in  Sweden, I think he was pretty aware and he did like the Farmer   s  Almanac (laughter), that was one of his books that he thoroughly  believed it and planted like those.  Is says plant and harvest when it says harvest   ?  Yes. Yes, and he did.  What were some of the holidays like?  Apparently and unfortunately all I knew was my great-grandmother  because Gustav was gone, but they were just family oriented since we  had somewhat of a small family, but he did try and keep some of the  Swedish traditions alive. They would have the Christmas tree and a lot  of home baked cookies and treats and that sort of thing. I guess both of  them were pretty serious people and they farmed most of the time. I  remember when they were probably in their sixties, and they lived until  their mid-eighties, that Gustav was getting tired of farming and getting  kind of old and Clara apparently said,    Well, if you   re going to retire,  then I am too and I   m not cooking anymore.    (Laughter) So I   m not sure  that that really worked, they kind of continued until they were unable to  do anything.  13  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Well I noticed on this diagram you showed that there   s a flag pole   ?  Yes, there was a flag pole in front. Unfortunately that   s gone too, but he  was very patriotic. When he got his citizenship he renounced his  Swedish citizenship. He was definitely going to be the American  citizen     Would he have done that before moving here?  Actually, he did because on the wall we   ve got his citizenship papers. I  don   t remember the exact date, but I could look and see, but yes, that  would have been because he moved to the U.S. in    84 or    85 and then  studied and got his citizenship probably a couple years later, so he was a  citizen by the time he came here.  It also shows that there   s a milk house, did they have more than one or  two dairy cows?  Just a few dairy cows, like two or three for their own.  For their own purposes?  Yes.  And I   m assuming they made ice cream?  (Laughter) Oh, definitely. Yes, because Mom always talked about  skimming the cream off the milk.  And cottage cheese?  And cottage cheese.  Did you participate in 4-H activities?  No, I didn   t. That   s what is so strange about moving back here because I  was not really connected to the farm at all. Because I grew up in the    50s  in Oklahoma City. After pretty much everyone had passed away and the  farm was rented out, most of my activity was coming out and Dad had  cattle out here when we had the original 640 and then after the cattle  operation we just went back to the farming and he had renters and the  tenants were doing the farming. When my mom moved out here with my  dad in    82, she raised llamas. She wanted to have something but     (laughs) and Dad actually still kept some of the farming operation going,  but at that point it was kind of the back section there. But Mom wanted  to have some animals so she raised llamas. And that   s what the barns are  14  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  now; those are llama barns. (Laughs)  Of the structures here, how many of them are still standing?  None. None, unfortunately, they are all gone. I don   t remember anything  other than the house, so I think the others had pretty much been torn  down by that time.  Are any of the vineyards still left?  No, but I   d like to plant one. (Laughs) Apparently it was along the  driveway. One of the barns out there is kind of a storage barn and there   s  an old wine press out there that I haven   t renovated and brought in, but  I   m thinking about that. In fact, that jug over there by the door is one of  the original jugs that Gustav would put his wine in. We actually have  100 year old wine that he made in a small container out in the  refrigerator that has  turned into  vinegar at this point since there are no  preservatives. I don   t have the heart to throw it out since it   s the original.  So I   ll keep it until it totally decays. (Laughs)  Once you took over the farm, what type of things have you been doing  with it? Anything in particular?  The main thing is trying to get the farming back because when we first  moved here, my husband and I, growing up in cities, had no idea what to  do out here. It was kind of interesting because I figured I would only be  here for a short time after the folks passed away, then we   d do  something with it, but now that I   ve been out here, I really enjoy it and  want to preserve it as much as possible. So I   ve been exploring the barn  and seeing the homemade furniture and all the relics that we have out  there and trying to fix those up a little bit. As I say, getting some crop  going again, we now have some hay that it   s not much up to horse feed  yet, but we   re working on it, right now it   s cattle feed. Then just  enjoying it because at night, the deer come out and they will come up to  the back porch. In fact, there   s a plant along the patio there that they  love to eat. I   m not sure how Gustav and Clara were ever able to  maintain a garden because they   d have to keep all the deer out, but  maybe with the activity that was sufficient to keep the deer away.  Because they will eat everything, they love the pears in the pear tree. We  also have coyotes that come through on occasion and the turkeys that  you saw.  That welcomed us today.  Yes. In the fall, spring is not quite as prevalent because they   re chasing  each other around, but in the fall they   re usually up on the patio and  15  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Nykolaiszyn  Bize  Finchum  they   ll be marching around. (Laughter) I try and get them off the patio  because I don   t like their droppings all over the place, but they tend to  come back as soon as I turn my back. But it   s so peaceful here and now  it   s in Oklahoma City, so you kind of forget about the rest of the world  when you   re out here. It   s just a whole different environment. It   s hard  for me to imagine what this was like in Gustav   s time because now we  have the electricity, we have water, sewer, everything that we need and  the idea that you had to go down to the well to get all the water that you  wanted. About the closest we   ve come is when we did lose electricity for  a week. We had to use the fireplace, sleep by the fire. Of course, we had  no water since we   re on a well with a pump, so we had to buy bottled  water, just not quite the same.  It seems like they chose wisely though, you   re on a knoll     Yes.  You can see almost 360.  He did. Because a lot of the areas around here don   t have the creek and I  think that   s why they were sold. But with the water, it really made a  huge difference.  What are some favorite family stories that you remember that you just  look back on and think,    Man, that was a great story      I think most of the stories were about Gustav and let me think, what  would be one of the cute ones? Oh, Mom said when you got a bee sting  that the way that you would treat that is with tobacco. That Gustav only  smoked a pipe on occasion, but he would chew tobacco and spit it on  your sting and that would somehow get rid of it, and apparently it did.  Everything was just a homemade remedy. I remember salve, whatever  salve is, was used for everything, if you got scalded by the hot water or  whatever.  She said that Gustav would always dress up for Sunday. The thing that I  think that   s kind of interesting, the pictures that we   ve got, is they  always look very clean. Everybody   s in white, living out here, how  could you be in white with this red clay blowing all over the place? I  guess it was the lye soap or something that would  make  bleaching a lot  easier with white than colors. I do remember all the pictures of Gustav;  he   s dressed up, even if he   s out in the field. He looks very nice, he   s  well kempt.  Do you imagine that she pressed his clothes?  16  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Oh, yes. In fact I   ve seen the irons, those big flat irons, which are very  heavy. (Laughs) But looking presentable whenever you left the property  was the important part.  I   m assuming in the early days, they did their laundry outside?  Yes, in fact, they had a clothesline, which is also something I haven   t  figured out because whenever I put clothes out, they come up covered  with all the stuff blowing around, but I guess you just get used to that.  (Laughs)  The early days had more trees you said, so maybe  that  was why     Maybe so, you didn   t have so much soil blowing around.  What would they do for entertainment?  Gustav whittled. He would actually use his little knife and make little  figurines or they played checkers and read. They both liked to read, so  he would read and wrote letters back home because he had an older  brother that stayed in Sweden and took care of his parents. He never  actually went back home, but he would write letters frequently. We have  some of them in Swedish, which I can   t translate.  And then your grandmother, what sort of things would she do for fun?  I think she was mainly working. (Laughs) I   m not sure she had a lot of  free time. Because it seemed like she was either sewing or cooking or  cleaning or something.  Did she have the pedal sewing machine?  Yes and there   s a younger version of the Singer sewing machine out  there with the treadle and that sort of thing.  When she would quilt, would she do those by hand then? Or piece it on  the machine and then hand quilt?  All by hand.  Did she have a favorite pattern, can you tell from what you have left?  I think the rings, whatever that    yes, that seemed to be. But a lot of the  quilts are just patches of fabric, just put together in a conglomeration of  things.  17  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  And were they used?  Exactly, and that was the idea. It was more for comfort because nobody  was going to see them but family anyway (laughs) so most of the time it  was just utilitarian.  Did she make you clothes?  No, my grandmother did though. Even doll clothes, I had handmade doll  clothes for all my dolls. That was kind of nice since I   m the only  grandchild from that because we had such a small family so I got my  great-grandmother   s doll and my grandmother   s dolls and everyone   s  dolls, so I have my little collection. I guess the thing that is amazing to  me is Gustav apparently was always upbeat, even though the life, to me,  seemed very hard. Apparently he was very positive, always happy,  always smiling. Even if the crops had a bad year, he knew that hey,  that   s okay. That   s life, you continue on, it   ll be better next year. Just a  very optimistic fellow.  And he passed that trait on, it sounds like.  Definitely to my mom. I try.  (Laughter) So do you have siblings, yourself?  I have one brother who   s ten years older and he   s a physician in  Oklahoma City.  And do you have children?  I don   t have any children. He has two daughters, who each have two  kids.  So where do you see the next 100 years of this   ?  I   m hoping that his daughters will keep it, although one lives in  Washington, D.C. and one lives in Dallas, so I   m not so sure how that  would work. But then, I was in Texas when my folks passed away  and   moved here. But the daughter who lives in Dallas has two boys, one who  is now ten and one who is seven, and they come up here every few  months and I like to take them down to the creek and play around, they  got to roll some of the hay bales around.  Get them attached.  Get them attached to the property so that maybe they will want to keep it  18  Nykolaiszyn  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  as well.  Why is it important for you to try to keep the land in the family?  That   s a good question. There   s just that attachment to the land and I  never thought I would have that. Because I   m allergic to everything out  here, so I have to live on antihistamines about six months out of the  year. I never thought I would really enjoy living out in the country, but  now that I   m out here, there   s a pull, there   s a bond with the land. I  would really hate to give it up.  And you actually moved into this house roughly   ?  In    99. My mom passed away at the end of    97 and Dad was a year later.  About three months after Dad passed away, I was actually living in  Washington, D.C. at the time and my husband was in Toronto, Canada.  We had been doing a commuter marriage for several years and decided  that this would be a good time to do something different. So we moved  back here. My brother didn   t want to live on the property, but he didn   t  want to give it up either. So we decided, okay, I   ll live here and see how  it goes.  You built the house or this was their house?  This was the house that was built in    82 when my folks moved out here.  Yes, my mom designed the house because she always wanted a big open  area, with lots of windows (laughs) so she could see. She designed it and  they moved out here.  And no curtains   ?  That was one of her requirements, she said,    I   m not going to block the  view with curtains.    She did that and as you can see it   s very peaceful.  It   s a nice retreat, even if you   ve had a bad day, you can come in and  just kind of chill.  Just stepping off of it in any direction you have the necessities of life,  within five minutes or less.  Yes. Now when I cook Thanksgiving dinner I don   t have to worry if I  forgot something, I just run down to the store, which is five minutes  away, get all my necessities.  (Laughter) Well, do you envision having livestock again, or just mainly  the hay?  19  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Nykolaiszyn  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  I think just the hay. The llamas were cute though, I really liked the  llamas. They were sweet, but it is a lot of work. You can   t really travel  and I   d like to be able to get up and go whenever I want.  How long did she have the llamas?  She had them, let   s see,    82-   95. So about thirteen years.  Did she actually sell them?  Yes. She started out with one female and one male and then eventually  added some more females and another male and had probably about nine  at the height. Then she would sell off the babies. She   d use the wool, she  had a friend who would actually take the wool and spin it. I have a llama  hat, a llama wool hat, sweater, that sort of thing.  How many farms you would consider your neighbors in this area? Are  there any others, or are you just surrounded by development?  Actually, yes. Just north is another one that I think has been in a similar  situation. I don   t know if it   s been in the same family for the entire 120  years, but it   s been in the same family at least for another sixty, seventy  years.  So you   re not the lone   ?  No, most of the others that I remember have been sold off. Now actually  across the street there, though, was one of the farms that Charlie  purchased, my great-great uncle, and the original house that was built in  the, probably,    30s is still there. Susan is I guess the third tenant in that,  because Charlie, which was Gustav   s brother, built his    which was, let  me think now, my grandmother   s sibling, Edgar, actually built the house  over there as I recall. It   s a stone house so it was probably built in the     20s. Still standing. And she still has about thirty acres. Now that was an  original 160, but it was a purchased one, so I don   t know who the  original homesteader was. But Edgar kept that--that was the sibling and  then sold it to Susan, who is living there now.  You had said you were a member of the    89ers?  Yes, the 1889ers Society. (Laughter) That is a group of descendents of  the people who made the Land Run here in the central part of Oklahoma.  They meet about every three months, get together and people brag about  their relatives and they   ve actually tried to get more activities in the  schools. I used to do a little talk at the Edmond Historical Society when  they   d have the fourth graders come in and talk about 1889er Day. Some  20  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Nykolaiszyn  Bize  of the other ladies have done that around town. That   s a tradition I  followed from my mother because she was doing that talk, so when she  passed away I just said I   ll take it on and follow her notes and give the  little talk about    89er Day.  Is that a pretty reasonable sized group?  Probably, well on paper, there are about 100. The people who attend the  meetings are about twenty and most of them are pretty old. (Laughter)  They keep saying how they want to have younger people, but  everybody   s spread out. Most of the descendants now are throughout the  U.S. Not many people are still around that would attend the meetings.  It   s kind of fun; that   s how I got some of the connections and history of  the area.   Is there  anything else you want to cover before we sign off?  One of the things that I thought was kind of cute that Mom had written  about, in the cellar, they would have pickle barrels and crocks of  sauerkraut, (laughs) and hedge cheese, which I   m not sure what that is,  as well as the jars of peaches, beans, corn, jellies, jams and the dried  beef would hang from the rafters. At butchering time, they would raise  the pig by ropes and dunk it into a barrel of boiling water and shave off  the coat with the knives. And hang the hams in the cellar after they were  smoked outside.  The outhouse, the one for the men, was by the blacksmith shop and it  was under a chinaberry tree and the women   s was under a mulberry tree.  It was a two-seater equipped with a Montgomery Ward catalog.  (Laughter) And on cold winter nights there was always a little porcelain  potty with a lid under your bed.  Oh, and this was kind of cute, telephone on the wall was three short  rings and one long ring was the Nordstrom ring, and it was a community  phone system. By lifting the receiver very carefully, you could listen in  on all the conversations down the line. My great-grandmother loved to  do that. (Laughter) That   s how she kept up with what was going on in  the world.  Woodstoves were where they did most of the cooking and they had a  huge black cook stove with spindly legs in the kitchen for warmth and  cooking.  That   s great that they made these notes.  Yes, Mom actually is a really good writer and she had written up quite  21  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  a    She was planning to write something formal, but never got to that,  so she did have a lot of notes. Oh, they had a grindstone near the  blacksmith shop. They made their own shoes, leather goods were home  tanned. And I said about the straw hats    Oh, and they got most of their  goods from the traveling salesman, that   s why they didn   t go into town,  because the salesman would come by with needles, pins, fabrics and that  sort of thing.  Does she say which one? Does she call him by name?  It just says the traveling salesman made the rounds. Then, also by the  creek, apparently since you could float on it, people would float down  the creek and they had Baptisms from some of the churches down in the  creek and she said they would have traveling Chautauquas, which I   m  not really sure what that is, but some kind of shows that would come  through and they would camp by the creek. I guess it   s like a mini circus  without animals, it would just be people and they would be little acts and  magic shows and things like that travelling through the countryside.  They would camp down by the creek.  Keep going, it sounds good   Let   s see, what else do we have here?  They used every piece of anything. It sounds like     They did. They had apples, pears, apricots, cherries and peaches and  strawberries. So they did have quite a bit.  Would they have planted those, do you think?  Yes. The only tree we have left is the pear tree and that is one of the  original pear trees right in the back. The pears are pretty tough, but if  you let them sit out long enough they sweeten up. But I noticed all the  animals love them. The coyotes love them, the deer, the turkeys, even  the skunks like them. That   s kind of interesting. Let   s see, Gustav and  Clara married in    The house, the second story was built in 1897, Mom  says. That was the date on that.  The second story of the two story building, or a second floor added to it?  The second storey was put in. Yes. Because the house apparently was a  year after, so that would have been 1890, because they lived by the creek  until then.  I noticed it has a long porch, do you have any memories or stories about  22  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  Finchum  Bize  activities occurring right on the front porch?  Mainly just watching people go by (laughter) was the main activity.  No rocking chairs, swings, or   ?  Yes, yes they did have two rockers. His and her rockers in the front. The  funny thing is, I   ve never heard of a dog. I know a lot of people had  dogs, but apparently they didn   t have dogs.  No pets?  No pets. There were wild creatures out there.  Not even cats for the dairy, the two dairy cows?  Now, I think they did have cats just to keep the mice away, but they  were old cats, they weren   t really pets. From the interview    yes,  Gustav said that they cut down trees and hauled them to the mill, which  was in Edmond. That was one of the first things they had in Edmond  was a little lumber mill. And built the one room house that was sixteen  by twenty, two years later we dug a well, and he said,    I still have the  first table I made.    I   m wondering which one that is? There are some  handmade tables out there in the barns. One of those must be his. I also  found the original trunk that he brought from Sweden. It   s out in the  barn. Gustav says that first year,    We bought a yoke of oxen and a milk  cow and lived on the place eight years before I married my neighbor  Clara Blades.    And Gustav says,    Our social activities were limited. We  attended church in Edmond.    (Laughter) So that was it; that was their  social activity. And he says that,    We helped our neighbors to harvest  grain in the fall and they helped us and then we   d have a big dinner  when everything was finished. We always had plenty of wild game and  fish. I worked hard for what I have and I   m still living on the  homestead.     That   s a very good note to end on, don   t you? You   ve worked hard and  you   re still living on the homestead.  Still trying to keep it going.  We appreciate you very much for sharing your story with us.  Well, thank you, it   s fun. It   s fun to kind of continue the tradition.  -------  -------
