Story_ID: 532253
Speaker 1: So, now we're gonna start by talking about your mother and father [Thomas S. Barnwell].  So, let's go to your mother first.  Tell me her name and if you know when she was born?
Speaker 2: My mother name was Hanna Edith Barnwell [Hanna White Barnwell].  She was born in 1909 on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay. And tell me your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother name on my--
Speaker 1: Mother's side.
Speaker 2: --mother's side was Grace White [Grace Gibson White].  And she died before my mother was born--or after--immediately after my mother was born (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) After the mother was born, okay.  Okay.  And your grandfather on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: My grandfather on my mother's side was Benjamin White.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, do you have any stories about--can you go back any further?  Do you know your great-grandparents or even their names?
Speaker 2: I don't know my great-grandfather, but I am beginning to meet my great-grandfather through research.  My great-grandfather name was Renty Greaves.
Speaker 1: Renty, how--how do you spell it?
Speaker 2: R-E-N-T-Y, G-R-I-E-V-E-S [sic.].  And he was a coroner in Beaufort County [South Carolina].  He was also a commissioner for roads in Beaufort County.  And he was also a teacher in the public school system.  He was quite an entrepreneur according to the records.  He bought real estate.  As a matter of fact, on Hilton Head Island at one point he bought two hundred acres of land.  Apparently he didn't keep it very long, for what reason I don't know.  But this was back in the 1800s.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you know anything about your grandmother's parents?  I know you said that your grandmother died right after your mother was born, but do you know anything about her parents?
Speaker 2: No.  I, I have not researched that family tree.
Story_ID: 532254
Speaker 1: Tell me about your grandfather, Benjamin White?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, Benjamin White--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --was quite an interesting personality.  He was the proud father of fifteen children, of which my mother [Hanna White Barnwell] was the oldest.  My grandfather was a real entrepreneur.  He farmed land on Hilton Head Island [South Carolina].  He encouraged the men that sailed boats from Hilton Head Island to build larger boats in order to be able to transport his produce from Hilton Head to nearby Savannah, Georgia to the market.  He hired many local persons on the island to assist in the process of cultivating the land during the farming season, and that was men and women I was told.  And during my lifetime, he, during the summer, hired my father's [Thomas S. Barnwell] truck.  He hired all of the vehicles and many wagons to transport the produce from the fields to the point of debarkation on Hilton Head to go to Savannah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandfather owned land here on Hilton Head?
Speaker 2: Yes, he certainly did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me how--do you know, (clears throat) excuse me, how he acquired the land?
Speaker 2: I--according to my knowledge and research, he bought the land from various persons over the years in various locations on Hilton Head.  And several of the family members still live on some of the land today that my grandfather bought.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did your grandfather share any stories with you about any of the family members being in slavery?
Speaker 2: That's the one area that he did not get into with us and I regret very much.  I, I, I guess we were too young and he was very rigid, and (laughter) you would be very humble to be with grandfather and not.  He would as- answer questions about land very easily, but the historical part of that part of life we did not get into.
Story_ID: 532255
Speaker 1: All right, let's talk about your mother.  She was, she was Hanna Edith White [Hanna White Barnwell] before she was a Barnwell, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay. Tell me about your mother.  Did she share any stories about her growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, some.  She talked about how they would, the family members would first get up early in the mornings to prepare breakfast and because she was the oldest of the children, she had certain responsibilities of--of laundry, house chores.  And then they would, during the summer months, go out into the fields and, and, and work the crops.  Then in the evenings, they would come back in and prepare the large meals for the supper meals for the family.  And begin to get ready for the, the next day.  And how they had, at, at that point they would have to bring the wood in the house to, to have it ready for the cook--preparing or cooking the food on the woodstove for the next day.  And then during the spring, the girls would also go out and clear the land and burn the brushes, getting prepared for planting the crops here on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  An--and of course, during the time they went to school on Hilton Head, there were no school buses and they would walk from their home to the school rain or sunshine, weather did not matter.  They would all go to school regardless whether it was raining or not.
Speaker 1: How much education does your mother have?
Speaker 2: My mother, fortunately, went to the fifth grade on Hilton Head, as well as others in the family.  And after fifth grade on Hilton Head, she went to Mather School for Girls [Mather School; Technical College of the Lowcountry] in Beaufort, South Carolina.  And after Mather School in Beaufort, she--she went to nurses training--LPN [licensed practical nurse] training in Columbia, South Carolina at the Good Samaritan Hospital [Good Samaritan Waverly Hospital].  And then after that, she went to Roper Hospital for her intern training in Charleston, South Carolina.  And after successfully completing that, she returned to Hilton Head.
Story_ID: 532256
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your mother [Hanna White Barnwell] and your relationship with her?
Speaker 2: Oh we were very close.  She, my mother, was also a school teacher on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] after she returned.  And she was very strict about education.  And she was a midwife, and because of her healthcare training, professional training, she would be asked by many persons that were ill for various reasons about various treatments for illnesses.  And of course, I could not say that I remember all of those various things, but--including when babies were--was delivered, she was the midwife for many families on Hilton Head Island.  And I remember distinctly driving my mother to do--to homes to do follow-up visits after the babies would be born.  There was a requirement apparently to visit the family for the first five to six days depending on the condition of the mother.  And my mother would talk with me riding in the wagon about the need for an EKG [electrocardiograph].  And I said, "Now what is that?"  And she would explain that was a test that would be done to make sure of the condition of, of the, the, the mother.  And she would talk about hematocrit and (laughter) and that was fascinating to me.  And she would explain those things.  But it, it, it, it, it gave me an additional appreciation for her professional training and her skills that led me into some other things later in life.
Speaker 1: As a mother that worked outside of the home, what are some of the--the other traits that you think that you have gotten from your mother?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my mother also was very involved with, with the church community and because she was involved with the women groups on the island, various societal groups, where--when a person was ill, for example, that she, along with other persons, would volunteer to make sure that the children of whomever might have been ill were adequately cared for.  She would make sure that the children was involved with their homework and, and, and the women--she along with others, took different chores, make sure that whomever might have been ill, all of the things in and around the home that needed to be cared for would be taken care of.  Those are some of the additional things that--that I got.  And, and she encouraged good sportsmanship to, to work with others, to be kind to each other.  And those were many of the things--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that I picked up.
Story_ID: 532257
Speaker 1: All right, let's talk about your father.  Tell me his name?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Thomas Sydney Barnwell [Thomas S. Barnwell].
Speaker 1: And when was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1909, here on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Do you know his father?
Speaker 2: His father, I didn't know his father.
Speaker 1: Do you know his name (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) His father's name was Jerry Barnwell.
Speaker 1: All right.  And his mother's name?
Speaker 2: His mother name was Georgianna Miller Barnwell.
Speaker 1: All right.  Tell me about your grandfather, Jerry Barnwell?
Speaker 2: Well, Jerry, as I was told, was also a farmer.  But Jerry didn't farm as many acres of land.  He farmed smaller acreage, but his specialty apparently was raising horses.  And from what I was told, Jerry had some of the outstanding Marsh Tacky horses on Hilton Head Island.  They were always well-groomed, very high-spirited (laughter), very perky horses.  And I was told they were very fast in terms of being able to--
Speaker 1: To run (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) win local races.  And those were the things that I was told about Jerry.  He was a very rigid disciplinarian.  He (laughter), according to my father, and, and my father's brother [Caesar Barnwell].  He did not allow them to abuse his animals as they were growing up.  And my grand- my, my, my Grandfather Jerry, they said, was so rigid until when my, my, my father's brother was old enough, he decided that he was gonna leave Hilton Head because his father (laughter) was much too rigid on him.  So, he, he left Hilton Head and went, went away.
Story_ID: 532258
Speaker 1: And your [paternal] grandmother, you knew her very well?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  My grandmother--
Speaker 1: Georgiana (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) Georgianna Barnwell [Georgianna Miller Barnwell] was, I would say, as close as two people could possibly have gotten.  And my grandmother, Georgianna, gave me an awful lot of concerns about land and land preservation.  An awful lot in, in, in terms of, of the historical--other historical parts of the family, the family tree from, from the Jones Miller side of the family.  And my gra- my grandmother was a very kind, caring, community oriented person that, for example, when, when, when strangers visit- visited the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], she would be one of the persons that the community club ladies would say--well they used to have a nickname for her, called her Mimmie [ph.].  "Let the person go to visit Mimmie house, Mimmie likes to cook and entertain people."  And so that's the, the spirit of which my grandmother was and the type of person--she was a people person I would refer to her as.
Story_ID: 532259
Speaker 1: And she [Barnwell's paternal grandmother, Georgianna Miller Barnwell] treasured encouraging the younger ones to hold onto the land and to pass it on to the next generation because she would talk about how Jerry [Barnwell's paternal grandfather, Jerry Barnwell]--and how she did and others raised their pecan trees on the land to help to pay the taxes.  And at a certain time of the year we would, as younger persons, have to go with her to pick up the walnuts and the pecan and put them in specific containers to--and, and, and she would make sure that--that they were protected, adequately dried and then she would send them on the boat to Savannah [Georgia].  And those dollars would be specifically set aside to pay the property taxes.  And that was an annual ritual that--that was passed on, and, and, and will always be remembered.  And in harvesting certain seafoods like oysters from the land adjacent to the waterfront.  When the oysters were sold, certain--a portion of that money was put aside to help to pay the property taxes.  And she would always encourage that come September, let's start making sure that those dollars are in place to pay the property taxes.  And that was extremely important and will always be remembered.
Speaker 2: What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But her--in addition to that, her wonderful cooking of, of flapjacks and having syrup was extremely important and very, very, very good.
Speaker 2: Did they make the syrup?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Syrup was made on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] by persons that had the mills right down the road.  And it was--along with the bacon that came from the attic, grandma really, really, really was fantastic.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell me more about your grandmother as far as her working the land and actually--you talked about how she made sure the pecans and the walnuts were ready for sale and the oysters.  But you just gave me a little bit about up in the attic, what does up in the attic mean (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Up in the attic is where--the, the families raised pigs, hogs.  And a part of the family food supply for the winter months was preserving the food that whether it was meat or be- butterbeans, peas or canned food.  Now in some families that raised the hogs, the hogs would be slaughtered in November and depends on the size of the family that varied.  The family would, would, would, would take the meat and those portions of ham and the bacon side would be preserved.  And there was--there was a process that, that, that went through during November that one would either take the ham to a community person that had a smokehouse here on the island, and/or have certain preservatives that, along with salt that was bought to preserve the meat and that process would take maybe two to three weeks, I don't remember exactly.  But the bottom result was that the meat was cured and preserved, and then was taken up to the attic and would be hanging on the rafters carefully, well preserved and as needed--as needed, the family would go in the attic and take a portion of that meat down and utilize it for family meals.
Story_ID: 532269
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's talk about your father, Thomas Barnwell [Thomas S. Barnwell].  Tell me about your father?
Speaker 2: My father was very much a community-minded, community-involved, church deacon, secretary of the church [Mount Cavalry Baptist Church; Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], community mortician or funeral director.  I was told at a point, he also did some school teaching, I don't know specifically about that.  He also farmed, not very large acreage.  My father always had, as I remember, a 1937 Chevrolet car.  And then after that, a, a truck.  And he was always a linkage of knowledge between community residents and the mainland in terms of trying to improve conditions, whatever those conditions might be that needed to be im- improved, whether it was school lunch, when we had the one room schools on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And the supplies would come by boat to Jenkins Island [South Carolina] on the island.  He would have his vehicle to help to deliver those canned foods to the various sites throughout the island.  And those--that's those of the kinds of things that he was very involved in and with, and supported my mother [Hanna White Barnwell] with her activities as well.
Story_ID: 532270
Speaker 1: And he [Barnwell's father, Thomas S. Barnwell] made me learn to ride the horses.  He taught me how to plow the horses.  He taught me how to cultivate the land in terms of using the harrow versus--that's, that's a horse pulled device.  You hook the horse up to, to a harrow to, to cultivate the ground.  He taught me how to, to put all of the, the collar and the hames and the trace chain and how to--how to adjust all of the--at that point, they were very primitive, but how to adjust the linkage on the trace chain (laughter) and using the horse to, to till the soil.  He, he taught me how to plant the seeds, that was important for, for not just me, but for the family that I had to do.  I had to farm my five to six rows of beans to save money to go away to school at a certain point.  And then, in, in, in the process of growing my beans, I would be required to go to Savannah [Georgia] on the boat with my three to four bags of beans to sell them and to bring the money back (laughter) to the family.  And they would put it aside in order that when I was old enough that to go away from the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] to, to school, that some of that money would, would be toward helping me at that particular time.  So, he also taught me when, when he got a larger truck, how to drive the truck, how to change the tires on the truck, how to do minor maintenance and check the oil, change--how to change oil on, on the vehicle.  So, I got a lot of hands on (laughter) from the field to the vehicle experiences.  And of course, along with all that came the responsibility of, of being careful, which is extremely important, even in today's world.  How to, how, how to be cautious of, of not, not running into somebody.  And how to be cautious of, of operating equipment, the vehicle.  I didn't realize back--way back then that those things would be appropriate, but they are very, very important, even in today's world.
Speaker 2: How much education did your father have?
Speaker 1: My father went through twelfth grade at Penn Normal, Agricultural and Industrial School [sic. Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.  So, tell me what was the greatest lessons learned from your parents?
Speaker 1: I would say learn to respect others and appreciate what you have and make the best use of what you have within the family environment, and be helpful to others, and your blessings will come back in multi-folds.
Story_ID: 532271
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Hanna White Barnwell] and father [Thomas S. Barnwell] met?
Speaker 2: They both, to my knowledge as, as, as, as told to me, were going to school away from the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], and somehow both of them got to meet each other because they were both off the island and they came back together at the same time.  And that's about all I can tell (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: No, I'm an only birth, natural birth child--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of my parents.
Story_ID: 532272
Speaker 1: Thinking back to your childhood, what are some of the sounds--some of the sounds that you can remember, some of the sights that you can remember, and some of the smells [of Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Wow.  Some of the sounds that I can remember are the sounds of the owls, (makes sound), out in the woods.  Some of the smells would be the smell of the salt marsh, which is, is, is a wonderful smell, natural smell.  That's the smell, the sound--
Speaker 1: And the sights (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and the sights.  The sights, they were very beautiful to see the buds from the various fruit trees and the--and the changing of the leaves and the various seasons here in the community.  But nothing stands out more than the buds from the pear trees and the blooming fruit trees in the springtime.  And in all of the yards, the individual yards throughout the community, just about everybody had flowers planted in their front yard or their side yards.  And, and just about all of the families and I, I, I now wonder why, but I think back that families did not allow grass to grow but so close to the houses and, and it didn't register until at a point in my family life.  We've had on both sides of the family, several fires within the family homes.  And I'm not sure, because we did not have regulatory and governmental inspection services to find out and discover why were the houses burnt.  But we had within the family, my, my [paternal] grandmother [Georgianna Miller Barnwell] and my mother [Hanna White Barnwell] and father [Thomas S. Barnwell], and my grandmother [Grace Gibson White] on my, my mother's side, we've had four, four fires over the years.  And, and that was a major setback within the family.  But, but the bottom line was to--that the yards were very clean.  The, the people did not allow, did not allow grass to grow but so close to the--
Speaker 1: To the houses (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to the houses.  And it was a protective situation for the homes.
Story_ID: 532273
Speaker 1: Before we go any further, I wanted to ask again, and I didn't ask when you were talking about your father [Thomas S. Barnwell], you said that he was a mortician.  Was he a trained mortician?
Speaker 2: No.  He was, he was an apprentice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and he worked jointly with a company, a firm, away from the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] in Beaufort [South Carolina].  And of course, on the island they had an organization called the farmers club that my father was secretary of and the active (laughter) person that would visit the home after the person expired and do all of the things necessary and comforting the family, and that, that, that's one of the things that, that he was extremely active with until he passed.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 532274
Speaker 1: Paint a, a picture--or maybe at this point you wanna give us a little history about Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], where the people came from?  You have some knowledge about that?
Speaker 2: Paint a picture of Hilton Head.  Wow. (Laughter) Where did the people come from?  Well, my, my grandmother [Georgianna Miller Barnwell], before she passed on my father's [Thomas S. Barnwell] side, said to me that she was told that her family--side of the family came from Sierra Leone, Africa.  She referred to it as (pronunciation) Sierra Leone.  Gullah, (pronunciation) Sierra Leone.  And on the other side of the family, I've never really investigated that.
Story_ID: 532275
Speaker 1: Painting a picture of the island is easy, sometimes not easy, depending on what period of the times (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I--I'm--I wanna talk about when you were a small child?
Speaker 1: All right, when I was a small child.  Okay, we had dirt roads, no electricity, no running water--
Speaker 2: In any part of the island?
Speaker 1: They had running water only in a section called Honey Horn [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  They had electricity only because they had their own generators there.  Hilton Head Island [South Carolina] did not have a connection to the mainland until the '50s [1950s].  Did not have electricity until the '50s [1950s].  Running water only came to families in certain portions of the island much after the '70s [1970s] and '80s [1980s] in some portion of the island.  Now that means that each individual family had what we refer to as an individual hand pump to pump water from the ground to use for cooking and bathing, as well as water for the animals.  And it was a part of a daily chore of every household on Hilton Head to have one, two or three buckets of water depending on the time of the day, the occasion (laughter) at the time of the day, of the number of buckets of water that would be in the--in the house for purpose of cooking, bathing and so forth.  All families utilize woodstove to cook with when I was a child, was born, was coming up.  Even I--my mother [Hanna White Barnwell] taught me how to bake and cook on a woodstove.  How to cook bacon, egg, and everything else.  It was--it was a different type of--of cooking utensils.  To be very honest with you, I think the food taste better, off subject (laughter), back then.  Because those, those butterbeans along with the home cured meat, (laughter) they were very, very tasty.  That's another whole area of growing up on Hilton Head.
Story_ID: 532276
Speaker 1: In terms of, of the island, people were very friendly.  We had neighbors that shared everything in terms if, if a person went out to the river, we went out to cast for shrimp.  When we would go out and if we caught more shrimp then the immediate family could consume for those two meals, it was automatic to share.  It was not a question, it was just an automatic thing to share that with the older families and families of the community.  In terms of the older persons in the community up in age, it was tradition for the younger persons in the family to go and cut the wood for the older persons in the family on a weekly or daily or rotating basis.  Not only cut it, but take it into the house and pump the water, and take the water into the house.  Those were the caring and sharing days that Hilton Head Island [South Carolina] was about.  And of course, if a person's horse died, that had crops in the ground and it was to my knowledge no list as to who would come what day to help that person to cultivate or to lay by or to (unclear) their crops, and these were languages relating to what I'm talking about now.  The (unclear) and to cultivate and the lay by, these are languages us- used to be used back in the days of the old Hilton Head when, when, when the crops were farmed.  But the point is that, persons would, would come on a volunteer basis from--throughout the community to not allow that farmer whose horse might have died to lose their crop.  And people had that kind of caring and sharing activities and opportunity.
Story_ID: 532277
Speaker 1: Now the church played a major role in any dispute of any type that would come up (laughter) in the community.  And that was a very interesting part.  Because at a certain age, persons were expected to go out in the wilderness to pray and to seek the opportunity of gaining the right hand of fellowship with one of the many churches that exists on the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And of course, if you did something wrong, then you would be called up to be counseled by persons from your prayer meeting, praise house, okay.  And depending on the outcome of whether it was resolved or not at that level, you might be put on the backseat of the prayer meeting house for a given number of weeks, months or whatever or you'd be referred to the church council to be dealt with.  And you might be put on the backseat of the church for a given number of weeks, months or whatever depending on how severe the condition might have been.  And so these were ways of, of, of monitoring and make sure that things went the way that the elders of the community felt they should possibly go.
Story_ID: 532278
Speaker 1: We had, we had interesting opportunities to learn to swim, those of us that lived close to the water.  We had opportunities to go out into the--to the marsh and learn how to bog for crabs.  This was the colorful good part when we would take the horses out of the plows at sun hot, during the day when the sun got hot.  Some of us growing up during the summer would continuously work and of course you had two options.  Sometimes an older person in the community would say okay, tomorrow or the next day or whatever day during the week depending on the tide condition, we--you--you--two or three of you will go, depending on the size of the batoe with an older person and learn how to cast and learn where the shrimp could be found away from the shore.  There were places like big hole, big dream (laughter), et cetera.  These--these don't mean anything--
Speaker 2: Is this shrimp or, or crabs?
Speaker 1: These are shrimp.  You, you learn how to cast a net and, and, and go to those respective areas where the shrimp would congregate.  And you'd cast for shrimp in those respective areas.  Now also you, at various times, at various tides, you'd learn how to fish for shark by--and how to bait the, the line and how to set the buoys.  Then, there were times that we would go out hook and line fishing.  Now, we didn't have rod and reels.  We had a, a throttle line, a line that you would put the, the, the, the bait on with the hook and you'd, you'd--there was a certain way you would put your finger out and you would feel the tug on the line and you'd know when to pull it and how to pull it, and they'd teach you how to do that.  But these were interesting times that--that exist on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] that the older persons in the community would, would teach those of us who were younger how to do these things.
Story_ID: 532279
Speaker 1: Then, there was the hunting part.  On Saturday mornings, persons from the various communities would, would congregate in certain areas and, and with, with our dogs and we would go out rabbit hunting [on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] (laughter).  And we would, we would have several dogs and the dogs--the trained, the more advanced trained dogs would help to teach the dogs without training how to, how to find the rabbit trails.  And--and as young boys, we would, we would have a green stick that's about five and a half to six foot long and we would hear the dogs running behind the rabbit and we would take various positions, and when the rabbit would come to our area we would hit the rabbit in the head with the stick.  And that would, you know, and we would do that for several hours.  And then there, there was the time that we would hunt raccoon.  That was a different process.  And our dogs would learn how to tree the coons.  And then--
Speaker 2: Tree the coons, what does that mean (laughter)?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Treeing the coon, okay.  (Laughter) Forgive me.  That would mean that the dogs would, would pick up the trail along the water, close to the water side or close to a pond, and the coon would run up the tree and, and it would be a challenge for us to get the bricks or the sticks before you would learn how to use a gun, and get the tree--the, the, the dog--get the coon to jump down the tree.  And that was quite a challenge.  And then when you get old enough, then you could go hunting with a gun.  And at that level, you would, you would also hunt with the dogs, as well as the gun.  And when the dogs would send the coon up the tree, you would be able to shoot the raccoon and get it to come down.  Now, after that level, there were the levels of learning to hunt with the gun and hunting for wild turkeys, as well as hunting for deer.
Story_ID: 532288
Speaker 1: You stopped at deer hunting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, deer hunting was an area that when you got old enough, based on your family's decision on old enough to be safe with a firearm, a gun.  Usually it was a shotgun of some type.  And they would allow you to have--to go out hunting with, and they knew, I mean the community residents knew who would be together.  And, and we were safe.  You go out deer hunting and you'd kill deer and wild turkeys.  And you would also share the deer meat with members of not just immediate family, but with people throughout the community.  And one day, my friend and I went out wild turkey hunting and the turkeys came from Pinckney Island [South Carolina], the next island across the way [from Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And we just had the greatest fun killing fourteen wild turkeys.  And each of us got seven turkeys and we thought that was just fantastic.  He took his home, I took mine home, and my mother [Hanna White Barnwell] thought, "Gee isn't that nice.  Now, what you gonna do, you gonna clean every one of these turkeys."  "Yes, ma'am."  "Now, you're gonna take one to Miss Sarah [ph.], you gonna take one to Miss Rose [ph.] (laughter), you gonna take one to Miss Julia [ph.]," and she went on down the line.  And from that point on, when I desired going out (laughter) for--to go hunting, I did not kill as many (laughter) of anything because the cleaning part was not as much fun.  So, when you got--start getting a bit up in the age, and you still have to do that.  That it, it was necessary of course, and that was the way of life.  And, but it was a wonderful way that taught the true meaning of sharing and caring for everybody in the community.

Speaker 1: You bypassed crabs, we need to know how you crab.
Speaker 2: All right, crabs.  How did you catch crabs (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Crabs. Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Two ways.  Maybe more than two, but during those days, you learned how to bog for crabs by going out into the mud.  Some people had boots on, some people were barefoot.  But you would have a stick with a Y in it and you would find--you would learn how to find that stick.  We used to call it a stick with a crutch.  And you would see the crabs in the mud.  You'd know how to identify it.  We, we learned how to identify the crab in the, in the crab bed.  We used to refer to them as crab in the bed.  And you would take that stick and put it across the back of the crab and when the crab had, usually, at least one claw, when the crab stick it's claw up, you would put it--put the stick across the back of the crab to avoid the crab from biting your fingers.  Now, we didn't have gloves and sometimes we got, you know, clipped by a crab claw.  But that was the process of, of learning how to do it.  And you would have a crocus sack in some cases and in some cases, you'd have a large bucket.  And then your sack might be way up on the hill.  But we would have a container to put the crab in.  And then you'd put the crab in that container and go on and continue to crab.  Now, the other way we, we crabbed, was on lines.  Two, two, two types of line.  You could put a throttle line out where you put bullnose, was a meat that you'd get from the crab boat, or put chicken backs and chicken backs was not very popular to put on, because back in those days, chicken was a meat that, that was used for family meals.  And nobody was, was rich enough (laughter) to, to use chicken for crabbing, and even the chicken foot was used to--to be eaten back in those days.  So bullnose was, you know, or ham skin was, was--that was the meat that you put on a throttle line.  And a throttle line was a long line that you would--you would put the meat, the bullnose, about twelve inches, more or less, apart and you'd string it along the side of where the tide would still not go totally low.  And you'd get in a batoe and string the line out for whatever length, a thousand, five hundred feet or whatever.  And then you'd have a dip net and someone would, would, would guide the batoe while you'd have one--there would be two persons, in some cases, most cases there'd be two in the batoe.  The batoe is a small boat, by the way, that's made locally that would have enough room to have a fifty-five gallon drum and--and you'd have a homemade dip net made from wire that you would have one person pulling the line as the other guide the batoe and each time that you--the crabs would hold onto the meat until you got to it and you just put the net in and scoop it up and put--put it in the--in the drum.  And then that would be another way of having some cash for whomever in the family that lived close to the water.  And the crab boat would come on certain time of the day from Port Royal, South Carolina, and would pick up the crabs and paid so much per pound for the crab.  And, and that's, that's the way that would be done.

Speaker 1: Tell me about transportation when you were a child on the island [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Transportation on the island.  Transportation on the island was predominantly by foot.  People walked to a great extent from one end of the island to the other.  The other method of transportation on the island was by horseback or wagon.  Now, every family did not have a wagon.  And of course, if the family--most families had a horse.  It depends on the priority of the family what use and some family had two horses, some family had three, depending on, on the economic and other conditions of the family.  But, most families had a wagon and the wagon and the horse was the means of transportation to church to a great extent, to visit to family members, as well as to take produce from wherever the farm was to the point where the boats would be going from to--on the island to Savannah [Georgia].  And then the third way was to utilize the two trucks that did regular pickups of produce that was the Simmons [Charles Simmons, Sr.] truck or the Tom Barnwell [Thomas S. Barnwell] truck.  And then later, there was the Patterson truck and Patterson truck and, oh the Driessen truck.  Later there, there, at some point there were four trucks running on the island.  Transportation, again, at a point on the island when the students did go to the junior high school, there was transportation provided for students to go from the Spanish Wells area [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] to the junior high school on the Simmons truck and the Squire Pope, Stoney area children went to school on the Barnwell truck, and I think the Chaplin children possibly went on the Patterson truck.  I believe that, that--those were.  But to a great extent, persons walk and before my time, I was told that, I was told that people who had a considerable higher income had buggies instead of wagons.  And then there were those, there were those that had even more income, had what they called a gig.  Now I'm not familiar with what, other than seeing (laughter) what it looked like in a book, but I was told about that, those other two.  Now, there was one other method of transportation that I--I'm sorry I did not mention, some persons did use their batoes who might have lived, for example, in the Spanish Wells area, that would row all the way from Spanish Wells all the way around to Squire Pope [Squire Pope Road].  That was unusual.  And I was told that sometimes when there was a funeral, people would come by batoe and they would take turn to row and take advantage of the tide going in certain directions.  So, those were the method--methods of transportation in and around the island for many, many years (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Years.
Story_ID: 532291
Speaker 1: You talk a little bit about church and how they kind of kept the law.  What was the law?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Were there sheriffs and jails or anything like that?
Speaker 2: There were no jails on the island.  I'm told that there was a constable on the island named Mose Middleton [ph.] during my father's [Thomas S. Barnwell] time, and he was the person that, that would be the mor- law enforcement type person.  And during my lifetime, there was one man named Benjamin Driessen who was the constable and he walked around occasionally during 4th of July and various days of, of, of, of big gathering and celebrations.  He would be dressed with his khaki uniform and his, his, his hat on but was of short, heavy built (laughter).  And he, he was very rigid.  I believe he had a for--yes he had a .45 weapon.  And to my knowledge, he only had, during my knowledge of my lifetime, he only had one case that I can think of that required a person going to the jail in Beaufort [South Carolina].  And he also had handcuff.  He had handcuff.  So, things were normally orderly.  Prior to that time, there was one instant back in the '30s [1930s] where two--I was told, that two men came from off the island and burned, set fire to a store that was in the middle of the island.  This was two black men that came from off the island and they set fire to a store and apparently they murdered the store owners.  And this was back, as I said, back in the '30s [1930s], and my [maternal] grandfather, Benjamin White, was taken in to jail.  And later, they found the two people wearing the watch and having the jewelry of the persons that they murdered, and then my grandfather, Ben White, was, was then released.  But those were the only time now, now--back in those days, there were persons on the island, I'm told, that made what they referred to as corn whiskey, illegal moonshine in other words, okay.  And, and, and these--there were persons that apparently were very good at cooking this moonshine.  And ever so often, the Internal Revenue Service [IRS] or the revenues as they referred to them, would, would, would, would come to Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and, and destroy the individual stills.  But, I, I only know what I was told about that.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: That's all I can say about that.  But, but apparently there was some illegal (laughter) moonshine that was made on Hilton Head back in the--in those days.
Story_ID: 532292
Speaker 1: So basically if there was a dispute, like you said, the church handled it.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So the church played a very big part in the community.
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: Not only with that, but tell me how else?  Well, tell me what churches were here, what church did your family attend?
Speaker 2: Well, (clears throat) excuse me, my family attend the Mount Calvary, used to be called Mount Calvary Baptist Church back then.  Now, it's called Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And my family also, some on the other side of my family, my mother's [Hanna White Barnwell] side, attend the St. James Baptist Church [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And St. James Baptist Church is where my mother and father [Thomas S. Barnwell] were married in 1934.  And then the original church on the island was First African Baptist Church [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And these churches still exist.  And out of--out of the First African Baptist Church grew these other two that I already mentioned, along with Central Oak Grove Baptist Church [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And at some point, there was a church referred to as Goodwill Baptist Church that was in the Chaplin area [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  That's not far from here.  That church, apparently, went out of existence and I don't remember hearing exactly why and exactly when.  But also out of FAB Church grew the, what's called the New Church of Christ [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And, and, and since that church grew up, then now there's also the Central Baptist Church.  These are predominantly African American churches along with the--they say that the Quinn, Quinn Chapel A.M.E. Church was--was one of the first A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] churches organized in the State of South Carolina.  That's right here on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] back in the 1800s.  And so those are the basic churches on--or the native churches on the island.  And they, they, they all, except the Goodwill Baptist Church, still exist today.  However, an interesting twist to that, when I came back from the [U.S.] Air Force, I tried--my father was very active with the, with the Mount Calvary Church and I met with my father and then the late--now the late Fred Owens [ph.] who was chairman of the deacon board of FAB Church and suggested that, excuse me, that you know, because of the island's potential growth and because of the population and now that persons all don't go to church by horseback, it might be well to consider consolidation of the black Baptist churches and they--they almost whipped me as a, as an adult.  And they said, "Who's gonna be chairman of the deacon board?"  I said, "You do it on a rotating basis."  "Who's gonna do this? And who's gonna do that?"  And I said, "Wow, okay."  So I gave up on, on the consolidation (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) On the idea, okay.
Speaker 2: --concept and I was told that (laughter) it wasn't gonna happen.  So, it, it still has not happened.
Story_ID: 532293
Speaker 1: You went to Hilton Head elementary school and did you say that--well tell me about the elementary school?
Speaker 2: Well, in each--in many of the communities, you see, Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] is an area that several sections of the island predominantly are settled by African American.  Starting from the Squire Pope [Squire Pope Road] area where I went to Hilt- I along with many others went to the Hilton Head elementary school.  There, these schools--some of these--at least three of the African American communities had what we refer to or what we know now, they were called the Rosenwald design community schools.  And those areas that had these schools were Squire Pope, Jonesville [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and there was one in Mitchelville area [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  Those were the three areas that had the predominant schools designed by the Rosenwald concept on the island.  There was, at that time, there was one white school also that was separate, had that design.  And that building still exists today along with the one that was at Cherry Hill.  I'm sorry, I said Mitchelville, Cherry Hill was the na- official name of that school, Cherry Hill School [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], and that building can be seen today on the land across from the St. James Baptist Church [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  Okay, now there were other communities that had--I'm sorry, there was one other, Chaplin eventually did get a Rosenwald designed school also.  Now Spanish Wells children went to school in the then prayer meeting house which was referred to as Spanish Wells praise house.  And then, later at some point, the residents of the Spanish Wells area [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] put up a separate building I was told, but for the elementary level.  And earlier in life before the people in Chaplin [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] had a Rosenwald school, they had classes in the Grand Army Hall [ph.], okay, which was built by residents of the Hilton Head Island community.  And it was much later in life that the residents of Hilton Head Island with the help of the school district, and with the help of one of the early, very wealthy persons from Gastonia, North Carolina that came to the area hunting birds and other animals, put up some money for a junior high school because he thought it was difficult for young people to be leaving the island early.  And he encouraged the potential of persons having a school developed here on the island for grades up to seventh grade.  And then the county and the district funded the positions and the school was built, and it was named Robinson Junior High School [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].
Story_ID: 532294
Speaker 1: After seventh grade, persons had to actually make a decision that they would go away to school to Savannah [Georgia] where they might have had relatives or someplace else, Baltimore [Maryland], Boston [Massachusetts], New York [New York], Chicago [Illinois], wherever they had relatives that could take them in in order that they could complete high school.  Or they would go to work in the local economy of, of farming, fishing and, and make it.  Or if the family had long range plans for them and had the connections and financial whereabout, they would then go to boarding school.  And boarding school at that point, to most people, was either Penn School, Penn Normal, Agricultural and Industrial School [sic. Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School], that was organized in 1861 that operated on St. Helena Island [South Carolina] for the purpose of educating freed slaves, that was one place.  The other one was Mather School [Technical College of the Lowcountry] that was in Beaufort, South Carolina.  And persons--now Mather School was an all-girls school, let me back up, I didn't say that.  But, but Penn School was coeducational.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right, le- let's go back to elementary school.  I wanna know about your experiences, make this a little more personal, okay?  What was the name of the elementary school that you went to, it was (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, it was Squi- Squi- Squire Pope Elementary School [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay, so it was Squire Ho- Pope--
Speaker 1: Squire Pope Elementary School.
Speaker 2: --Elementary School.
Speaker 1: And it was a two room school.
Story_ID: 532304
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about your experiences in elementary school.  You went to Squire Pope Elementary School [ph.].  Tell me about the school?
Speaker 2: The school was a--it was a Rosenwald school building on Squire--
Speaker 1: What is Rosenwald school building?  Tell me what Rosenwald is?
Speaker 2: Rosenwald is a--Rosenwald schools were throughout the Southeast at a given time in history, where along with Sears and Roebuck [Sears, Roebuck and Co.], Rosenwald [Julius Rosenwald] was a person that at a point in history when education was separate and equal [sic. unequal], Rosenwald was a white individual that apparently felt that to get--improve education there needs to be buildings built that would be facing certain climatic condition that would allow sunlight and a design of windows in a certain way to help with heat, because back then people had to heat the buildings with woodstove.  And also, in many cases, there would be either a one or two, and in some cases, three classroom buildings.  In most cases, there were one classrooms.  And they tack on to that building a small area that was used for food preparation and the food would be brought directly to where the students would be in the building.  So, this was a Rosenwald school building in the Squire Pope [Squire Pope Road] area.  The land was secured by the residents of the community for the building.  Now, the school district apparently was--deeded the land with a reverter clause that when the, the, the buildings were no longer used for educational purposes, the land would then go back to the original owners, whether that happened in all cases I'm not sure.  It happened in most cases on--in, in this community, Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].
Story_ID: 532305
Speaker 1: All of the students from approximately two and a half miles radius of that building on Squire--old building on Squire Pope Road would walk to that two room school every day, rain or shine.  In that building there were two teachers and my mother [Hanna White Barnwell], for many years, was one of those teachers (laughter).  It's getting very personal.  The other teacher was Miss Olivia Wright.  And of course they knew all of the parents in the community and they knew all of the students in the community.  And all of the students who went to that school went to the same church in the community.  And so, it was almost, you know, everybody was not family, but, but technically families in, in that given area, in this given area went to that school.  And, and so, we had a very tight rope.  And I personally had a very tight rope to walk because if, if, if I didn't do something just right, I would have punishment.  And of course, to be even more personal, I did not know it back then, but I look back today and say I was, and still is, dyslexia.  And the teachers back then did not know that.  And the reason I'm--I look back and say that is that I was not the best in math, but I was reasonably good.  But Ms. Wright did not detect it.  But because of my dyslexia, I would revert numbers, not purposely.  And I got many whipping from my mother because Ms. Wright said, "Your son changed the number and he came out with a different answer.  And this is the real answer and everybody else in the class got this answer and he revert the number, he changed it."  And, and I didn't know until many years later I was dyslexia.  And that's what was happening in my, in my life.  But other subjects like, you know, little--the amount of science that we got and amount of history we got, did okay.
Story_ID: 532306
Speaker 1: It was good, and of course, we, we walked very briskly in the rain, in the mud, jump over puddles and (laughter) things like that.  We had recess and we had a ball field adjacent to the, to the school.  The girls did things like jump roping and things like that.  And of course, the boys had to, and I included, we had to, to cut the wood, bring the wood in and of course, we also had to, at the end of the day, sweep the classroom, dust the classroom, wash the, what we had then, blackboard.  We had chores within the school building to take care of on an ongoing basis and those chores were, you know, were transferred week by week from different persons to carry on.  And we did not have, as, as I noted today, field trips.  Sometimes we, we would have someone that might have been away to college come and talk about their experience, occasionally.  But other than that, it was reading, writing, arithmetic, diagramming sentences, spelling, (laughter) doing math assignments, those kinds of things.
Speaker 2: What did you enjoy most?  Did you like to read?  Did you, wha- what subject did you like the best?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I, I liked history.
Speaker 2: History?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, at that point.  I mean I liked to know, you know, I was, I was amazed and fascinated about government, that sort of--
Story_ID: 532307
Speaker 1: Did you have any idea of what you would like to become when you grew up?
Speaker 2: No.  During that time of life, you would listen to your parents and they would tell you boy or girl, "You gonna do this."  And you didn't have much of a choice back then of making your independent decision.
Speaker 1: What was slated for you?
Speaker 2: I was slated to be a funeral director and a teacher combined.  Funeral director slash teacher.  Even the public health nurse would say, "Oh we gonna be so glad when you go to college and come back, you're gonna be," (laughter) "a teacher here in the community" (laughter).
Story_ID: 532308
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me what happens when you go to Robinson Junior High School [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What--what year is this, do you remember?
Speaker 2: In the '40s [1940s], in the '40s [1940s].  I, I--when I went there we had two teachers, a male and a female.  We--again several things, one of my aunts was a teacher there.  Again, very rigid, you gotta get your homework, you gotta do this, you gotta do that, you gotta do (laughter).
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: So, I, I, I couldn't escape, okay.  When I--what happened when I went there.  I had additional responsibilities because by then my father [Thomas S. Barnwell] give me the key to the truck to drive safely to pick up the students from the Squire Pope [Squire Pope Road] area on a timely basis, drive them to the school safe and bring them back in the evening safe, and in addition to doing my schoolwork, my homework and all that.  So, life then started to become extremely interesting.  And we had a common goal with persons that we would not see very often, but we then started, you know, people from the Chaplin area [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], we would see them at church on Sundays when the church would visit.  But, but then the relationship started growing and getting larger.  That was a very interesting part of life.
Speaker 1: It was interesting why?
Speaker 2: Well, because competition, competition in, in spelling, competition in math, competition in science and history got to be greater.  And the grading system, I mean, you know, actually what score would you make, would you make a 70 or an 80 or a 90 [percent], and, and you know, then you start wondering, okay wait, wait a minute, you know (laughter).  And the challenge, the challenges got to be a little bit more.  And so you had to work each, each, I find myself working a little bit harder to really, to really do what was necessary.
Story_ID: 532309
Speaker 1: At this point, you are, are you looking at the fact that you would go away to high school?
Speaker 2: It was not what I was looking at.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a must.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It was a must, it was a must that when you, when you leave the Robinson Junior High School [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], you will go to Penn School [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] because your unc- your father before you went to Penn School.  Your uncles have gone to Penn School.  And you will go to Penn School.  And so, that's the way it went.
Speaker 1: When was your dyx- dyslexia detected? Or was it detected by this time?
Speaker 2: Actually, actually when I went into the [U.S.] Air Force.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right, so we'll get to that later on.  Now, the money that you saved selling your beans and peas, was this the money that was gonna be used for you to go to Penn School (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, tell me about that process of Penn School, because you had to actually pay, so what students were able to, to go to the Penn School?
Speaker 2: Well, first you had to fill out some papers (laughter), which I had thought was quite a challenge.  And, and then you had to have reference and, and I fortunately had reference because my father [Thomas S. Barnwell] went there and so many uncles.  And then you would be assigned certain work chores or responsibilities in addition to being able to compete educationally.  And it was an interesting shock culturally and a new--
Speaker 1: Why was that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) and a new experience.  Well, the cultural part was that the library utilization.  We had here on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], you know, a set of encyclopedias, a dictionary and that was sort of--
Speaker 1: That was it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) that was sort of it.  But when we went to Penn School, you know, Ms. Brown [ph.] said, you know, "You're gonna do a term paper."  "A who paper?"  "Yes, a term paper and you gotta go to the library and you gonna have to do research."  And I say, "Who?"  That's the shock, okay.  And so, you know, you got to then find your way around and then you gotta go over to library and get a library card in order that, and you know, this is foreign stuff, that's the kind of shock that I mean.
Speaker 1: The encyclopedias and the dictionary, where were they housed on Hilton Head, were they?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, they were in the, in the, in the--
Speaker 1: In the school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were in the school, in the school.
Speaker 1: Oh in the school, okay.  So there was no library on Hilton Head?
Speaker 2: No, no, that's what I'm talking about (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, okay, I, I got you, I got you.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, I'm not being very specific.
Speaker 1: No, I understood, but I just wanted to make sure there wasn't a place that they were housed other than school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 532310
Speaker 1: So tell me about the physical school, Penn School [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: There were several build- several buildings.  I, I, some of them were taken down so I, I would be misrepresenting if I said they were thirty-five, forty buildings.  But there were somewhere between thirty, thirty-five buildings on the campus, very large place.  There were, there was dormitory for, for male students, supervised by a teacher of the school.  And there was a dormitory for female students, supervised by teachers that lived in that dormitory.  There was a dining hall that had specific hours that you had to be there in the dining hall for breakfast at a given time in the morning.  You would have to have your meal tickets to get in and if you didn't have your meal ticket, you didn't eat.  The meal tickets indicated that you paid your (laughter) room and board.  And if you lost your meal ticket, you're in trouble (laughter).  You may not eat.
Speaker 1: Do you know how much you paid to go to school?
Speaker 2: It was something like seventy--fifty to seventy-five dollars a month, maybe more, but at--in that range.  And, and, and you had to do a percentage of work.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what kind of work did you do?
Speaker 2: I cleaned classrooms at first.  And then later I got assigned to ringing the bell for class changes.  And then in addition to that, I got assigned to the principal's office to run errands between the school and Beaufort [South Carolina] because I had a driver's license.  I had--one of my, one of my cousins had a friend that was able to help me get my driver's license the second year I was there (laughter).  So after I got my driver's license then I got this additional responsibility.  But I cleaned classrooms.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was my primary job.
Speaker 1: Now the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Sweep and what have you.
Story_ID: 532311
Speaker 1: The school [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] was an agricultural school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So did they have fields (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Agricultural, normal and industrial.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and they, they were phasing the agricultural part except for the 4-H activities, was about phasing out.  They had some poultry, but not an awful lot when I came along.  And see prior to that time, they had cows.  They did their own dairy milking.  They raised their own corn.  Did their own mixing of, of feed for animals.  They raised a lot of potatoes.  They used to raise a lot of hogs, cattle for slaughtering.  And at a certain time of the year, they had a big barbeque that the whole community came in and Thad Watson [ph.] would cook a big hog or two or three hogs that they had.  And, but when I came along, they still had the shop area, that, that you would--that was required.  You'd have to go to the carpentry shop.  You'd have to take mechanical drawing.  In addition to taking the sciences, the math and the history, and all that, but you had to go to shop.  Some people went into phases of auto mechanic, I did not do that.  I went to, to the woodworking shop part 'cause I felt that I needed to, to be able to, (laughter) to put wood together and learn the mechanical drawing aspect.  But I also took the 4-H part.  And, and I enjoyed the shop, I enjoyed the 4-H.
Speaker 1: In the 4-H, what did you learn in 4-H?
Speaker 2: Well, how to raise chicken and things, and how to make brooders.  As a matter of fact, I still have a brooder out there today.
Speaker 1: What is a brooder, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Where you, where you raise, you can raise duck, chicken, rabbits, those smaller animals.  And then you learn on--in 4-H how to care for certain animals and how to identify the various species of hogs and cattle.  You know, there's a difference in hogs.  You have your Holstein [Holstein Friesian], you have your Yorkshire [American Yorkshire], you have your Berkshire, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  And then in your cows, you know, you have your dairy cow and then you have your meat cows, you know.  And you know, in the meat cows you have your, your Devon [North Devon], you know, you have your, your, your other, your Angus, you know.  And of both of those you have different cuts and things of that type.  And of course it's been so long, I've, I've been away from it for a while.  But, but that, that was, that was exciting to me because it tied in to being back--it, it helped me to understand an, an awful lot more.  And so I was trying to find my way, you know--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --back then.
Story_ID: 532312
Speaker 1: Was there a teacher that stands out in your mind during that time that might have encouraged you [at Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  I would say there are. There, there's several.  And of course, the one that I guess, the shop instructor that a lot of us got, got a lot from was a man named Thomas Dees [ph.].  He, he was, he was a man, he wore a bowtie all the time (laughter).  And he used to tie it, apparently tied those bowties every morning.  But he was always so encouraging as a teacher and encouraging you when you ran into difficult moments of, of a challenge of, of, of getting the drawing assignments completed.  He said, "Well you gotta learn, you gotta learn to look at it more than one way" (laughter), you know.  "And you gotta look at trying to remember to do it," I guess that's why I keep saying, do it right now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: But he was very encouraging and very inspiring.  He was an industrial education person.
Story_ID: 532313
Speaker 1: Now, the school, itself, was on St. Helena's Island [St. Helena Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And did you get an--
Speaker 2: Private (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) opportunity to come home?
Speaker 2: Oh, we only came--yes, we only--we got an opportunity to come home during the Thanksgiving holiday for about whatever those number of days for Thanksgiving.  And then we came home for Christmas, and that was it.  But other than that, you stayed right there.  Now back to the campus.  The interesting other part of the campus, for one moment, was the laundry building.  The men got to go over to the laundry building only on Wednesdays.  So you had to, this was the other part of the cultural shock that you had to learn to program your clothing demand and need--needs in the laundry, you know, I mean, you know, washing your own clothes, ironing your own clothes and doing all your laundry for the entire week only on Wednesdays.  Because that's the only day that boys or, yeah boys, (laughter) would be allowed to go to the laundry.  So that was an additional new challenge that I had not been familiar with.  I mean, I was familiar with washing my own clothes, my mother [Hanna White Barnwell] used to make me do that.  But I did not understand, you know, to, to, to budget the (laughter)--
Speaker 1: The amount of clothes for the week.
Speaker 2: Yes.  To last for a week and you, you just couldn't go across there, that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  St. Helena's Island, the transportation from that island, was--there was a bridge that came across or you didn't have to go by boat to go (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. We went, we went from Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] by boat to Buckingham [Buckingham Landing], at that time.  Buckingham is close to Bluffton [South Carolina] where the bridge now connects Hilton Head with the mainland.  All right, so, we, we would put our trunks, our suitcases and our boxes in the back of a truck.  We would then unload them from that truck onto a boat at Jenkins Island [South Carolina] dock.  We would then unload those parcels from the boat to the back of a big truck that had a top on it, a great big truck that had a top on it.  And all of our bags marked would, would then go with us in the back of that truck from Buckingham to Penn School [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina], which was, at that time, about a two and a half hour ride from Buckingham.  Because the Bucking- the road from Buckingham all the way up to Highway 17 [U.S. Route 17] was usually a dirt road.
Story_ID: 532314
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're at Penn [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina] and what happens that you leave Penn?
Speaker 2: Well, the county took over the public school educational responsibility county wide in 1948.  But the county leased the facilities from Penn board of trustees because they did not have physical school building and facilities.  And the Penn, the, the county opened St. Helena High School [St. Helena Island, South Carolina] in 1953.  So, physically, the dormitories were closed and the students all moved to the new St. Helena consolidated school in early 1953.  (Laughter) So I was a part of that transition.  We're getting--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: All right, so you go to St. Helena's and you graduate in 1954.
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, St. Helena's--okay, '54 [1954].  Now at this time, what are you thinking about higher education, are you deciding to go to college, are you going back to Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] to work?
Speaker 2: At that time, I decided I'm gonna give college a try.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what school did you--?
Speaker 2: I applied to Claflin College [sic. Claflin University] in Orangeburg, South Carolina.  And I was accepted to Claflin College in Orangeburg.
Story_ID: 532315
Speaker 1: And how was college days for you?
Speaker 2: Ah, more interesting things started happening (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, such as?
Speaker 2: Well, such as, a bigger environment and this time I'm wondering, I have enough money to make it through semester one.  How am I gonna make it through semesters beyond that?  How are my grades gonna shape up in comparison to all of the other persons that I'm now competing with for this new potential career that I'm trying to look at.  And I registered for the elementary education curriculum because I was told that eventually I'm supposed to be a teacher (laughter).  And looking at the curriculum early that, that Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] said you have to--all of the courses you must go through in the four years that you're there.  And things like art appreciation (laughter), biology, cer- certain requirements in English, and that's when I started discovering that I had a deficit even with reading.  Because my English professor after taking a series, a battery of tests getting there, said that, "We're gonna recommend that you use a rayometer, which would help to improve your reading skills.  You speak very well, but you have a deficit that needs to be improved."  And I said, "Okay, I will do that."  Went to the reading room, checked out all of the, the equipment, started doing that.
Story_ID: 532316
Speaker 1: At a point after being there [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] for, for the first two and a half months--went there in September, October, November.  And in November, discovered that I was about to be drafted into the [U.S.] military.  So, went next door to the South Carolina State College [South Carolina State University, Orangeburg, South Carolina] campus where one of my uncles was.  And we had a chat.  And I said, "You know, I'm told that I might be drafted."  He said, "I was told the same thing."  We both went up about the same time, at the same time.  And so I started rethinking my college career.  That maybe instead of going into the [U.S.] Army, I would volunteer to take the Arm- the [U.S.] Air Force aptitude test immediately and see whether or not I would qualify to go into the Air Force as a volunteer for four years.  And after the Air Force, then I would have the option to go back to college.  Because at that time, the Vietnam War also guaranteed that, that after the Air Force one--after military service, in other words, one could--would have the benefits to go back to college.  I said well that sounds like a pretty good option.  It'd give me time to kind of get settled down.  And so, I, I decided instead of allowing those military papers to reach me personally in Orangeburg [South Carolina], I would say to the Air Force, "Here I am" (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now let me ask you, if--how old you--how old were you because it seems you would be--when you graduated from high school [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina], were you nineteen when you graduated from high school?
Speaker 1: Nineteen, twenty, yeah.
Speaker 2: And was that because you started school later?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Because of your birthday in this state, I don't remember the details, but because of the, the, the--because of your birthday, you would start school at a certain time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 532317
Speaker 1: All right, so you're twenty when you leave college and go into the [U.S.] Air Force.  Where were you trained?
Speaker 2: In Texas at Lackland Air Force Base [Bexar County, Texas], Flight 83 (laughter).
Speaker 1: And did you--who were some of your instructors?  You, you were airman, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was an airman, basic, basic airman.  I wo- did not get into officers training at all (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, okay.  And wh- what did you know about the Tuskegee Airmen?
Speaker 2: I--I don't know anything about that at all.  I just went to school there after the--after the Air Force I went to school there.
Speaker 1: Were there any key instructors in the Air Force that you know--that you remember?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: About the Air Force.
Speaker 1: Yes, the Air Force.
Speaker 2: You told me where you were, were trained.  Now tell me, where did you go and what was the experience like?
Speaker 1: Well, the experience at Lackland Air Force Base first, basic training.  It was flight, like I said Flight 83, for those weeks we were there.  Learning the military discipline was an entirely new experience.  And it was the time that the Air Force was going from a segregated service to an integrated service.  And we were fortunate in my flight that we had persons goi- volunteering for the Air Force that had Army ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] training.  Unfortunately, at Claflin [Claflin University, Orangeburg, South Carolina], we did not have that.  So I was not familiar with all of the military drills and how to execute all of the commands in flight--in, in actual, you called in drill training.  So, therefore, I was not--and this is when I first really got a feel for my dyslexia, because you have to click right at the demand of the call of making right flanks, left flanks, to the rear march, et cetera, et cetera.  And, and that's when I, I had to do some extra hours of maneuvers and fortunately, sergeant that--that was in charge of our flight realized that I was not making those move purposely, it was that I just did not have untapped the knack for that until I had additional hours of drills.  And I did all the additional hours of drills, and I came out of flight training real good, and I liked it.
Speaker 2: Who was your first experience--how was your first experience in an airplane?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Strange, different (laughter).  I'm trying to think very quickly.  I think my first flight was from Savannah [Georgia] to Atlanta [Georgia], and making a trip all the way back to--all the way back to where--I'm trying to think of that very first flight, back to Texas I believe, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 532318
Speaker 1: Did you go overseas?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I did.  And I stayed overseas for two years and five months.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to Ramey Air Force Base in Puerto Rico [Aguadilla, Puerto Rico]. Puerto Rico, where the climate is good year round.  Believe it or not, I applied to go to France, and they sent me to Puerto Rico.
Speaker 1: Well, that's a very different place.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: What was your experience in Puerto Rico?
Speaker 2: Well, my experience in Puerto Rico was a good duty assignment.  I was assigned to the 72nd training operation division [72nd Air Base Wing] of--of Second Air Force B-36 [Convair RB-36 Peacemaker] squadron in Puerto Rico, all those number--the things don't mean anything to you.  But they had--what they call at that time B-36 aircrafts on the base.  And Puerto Rico was a Strategic Air Command base where we had very strict security and we had certain--at that time, they, they were doing the preliminary testing of, of the fuel that they now use in space.  And so I had to be cleared for a certain kind of security levels.  I was assigned to the aircraft fire and rescue division.  And I got--I received training in, in that area of aircraft crash, rescue and safety.  And I, I went into that area because I thought gee, after getting out of the [U.S.] Air Force, this could become a backup option for civilian employment, which was very good, I thought at that time.  And I got assigned to riding a fire truck as a lineman and I did that for about ten months or so.  And while being on duty and off duty in Puerto Rico in the Air Force, I took extension services through the Air Force system to improve my skills, my academic skills.  And I did move up in rank a bit.  And I did move up from a lineman on the truck to the number two person as an alarm room operator.  That is the person that was actually responsible for sending the equipment out.  And when the (laughter) the sergeant that, that I worked for in that alarm room rotated out and got discharged, I then move up to the chief alarm room operator for the entire Air Force base.  And, and was fortunate to, to help Second Air Force to, to be number one in the country during the years that I was there for a quick response, safe response and timely response to disaster situations with the Air Force within that timeframe and got recognized by Air Force personnel in the Air Force for, for my efficiency of operation.  And I enjoyed that.  And they then said to me, "Wouldn't you like to consider going to officers training school [Officer Training School], become a warrant officer first?"  Because it was then when I started moving up like that, then they said, "Well wouldn't you like to reenlist?"  And I said, "Well I'll think about that for a while," but my answer was no.  I don't think I wanna do that.
Story_ID: 532319
Speaker 1: You said that the [U.S.] Air Force, at that time, was desegregated.  Did you find that it was easy for you to move up in ranks or was there still an underlying bit of prejudice there?
Speaker 2: I, I think there was a, a bit of underlying prejudice still with- within even, within the Air Force, yes.  Even then, you had to have a certain number of months or years, time in grade, they say, before you move up.  And, and within the command of Second Air Force, Eighth Air Force Strategic Air Command, they said they only, they only had so many slots to move up within a given timeframe.  But, even then, certain whites just came in and because they had the political connection and, and I did not get recognized.  I'll be very honest, I did not get recognized until I wrote Strom Thurmond when I was in the Air Force and told him in writing at that time how I was being passed over.  And all of a sudden, the skies opened up after I did that, then things started happening.  I mean, I was recognized.  So the political, even then, the political pull, you had to have, and you had to know somebody to be able to move up.
Story_ID: 532320
Speaker 1: So you're discharged [from the U.S. Air Force] in 1959?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  And tell me what happens next?  Where do you go?
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959] I came back to Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  And stayed here and applied for college entrance at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], it was called back then.  And I got accepted--well I came back here and I worked in--in doing various and sundry things.  I did some work with various companies here on the island.  And I then also looked at doing some work as a longshoreman for a short period.
Speaker 1: You said you looked into it--
Speaker 2: And I did, I actually did it.  I looked into it and I did it.  I did some longshoreman work.  And then I applied to and went to Tuskegee as a freshman.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you did the longshoreman work before you went to Tuskegee, right?
Speaker 2: I did some before and some after.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did you belong to a union, because longshoreman--
Speaker 2: Well, you did-because, because I had an uncle that was president of the International Longshoreman 1414 [International Longshoremen's Association Local 1414] in Savannah [Georgia], as well as having some cousins and friends who were members of the union, I was able to do what they referred to as scab work (laughter).  And, and, you know, I, I had this work ethics (laughter), forgive me, but I, I, I didn't like to just do nothing.  I, I like to be earning.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was just wondering because it sometimes is difficult to get into those unions.
Speaker 2: It is, it is.  It was.  But I, I, that's how I was able to do that.
Story_ID: 532321
Speaker 1: Now you go to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama], tell me about your experience there?
Speaker 2: Well, Tuskegee was, it was fascinating.  You know, I, I applied to go to Tuskegee really because when, when I was stationed in Puerto Rico [at Ramey Air Force Base, Aguadilla, Puerto Rico], I would read about the gerrymander situation and the case Gomillion versus Lightfoot [Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 1960] in the Miami Herald.  That was a newspaper that we could get in Puerto Rico on a regular basis.  And I tried to follow that and I was very concerned, as you know, I was interested in history and I was very concerned about how could this be that all these educated people, people with masters and Ph.D. degrees not being able to vote and they actually gerrymandered the city limits to avoid black people from voting.  And since I was gonna go back to school, I said you know, getting closer to that situation would be very interesting.  And that was the motivating factor for me to apply to Tuskegee and I did, and they accepted me to Tuskegee.  And I enjoyed the opportunity of being there and I got to meet the Professor Gomillion [Charles G. Gomillion], personally--
Speaker 1: Gomillion?
Speaker 2: Gomillion, yes.  And I was actually enrolled in hi- in one of his courses, Sociology 240.  And, and, and it was--it was that professor, Gomillion, after the [U.S.] Air Force that really motivated me in a, in a way that I'd have never been motivated before in terms of time and planning one's schedule.  As he would say, "One must plan one's schedules in order that your life will be, be meaningful."  And, and it was during that timeframe that I really, really, really got to get a firsthand look at the, the, the service that one can help to provide to an awful lot of individuals on a, on a firsthand basis.
Story_ID: 532322
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I stayed to Tuskegee full time for about nine months.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I came back to Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  That's when I decide that I wanted to start a family because my mother [Hanna White Barnwell] was pressuring me about seeing some grandchildren.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay, and so do you get married (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what's your wife's name?
Speaker 2: And, and, and my wife, at that point, name was Allaphae.
Speaker 1: Spell that?
Speaker 2: A-L-L-A-P-H-A-E, Allaphae Gantlin, G-A-N-T-L-I-N [Allaphae Gantlin Barnwell].
Story_ID: 532323
Speaker 1: Also this is a ti- the time when you joined the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Who was the--who set up the local chapter?  That was here on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: On Hilton Head.  A man named Samuel Bolden was the president and I became a life member of the Hilton Head NAACP.
Speaker 1: And who else was involved with the NAACP during that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, there was--there was [HistoryMaker] Emory Campbell, Clarence Ford, Harry White [ph.], Naomi Fraser [ph.], and Charlie Simmons [HistoryMaker Charles E. Simmons], Diogenes Singleton (laughter).  And I can go on.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  So, were you following--Thurgood Marshall now is involved with the NAACP by this time.  Had you--had the chapter begun, what type of, of work here on the island?
Story_ID: 532332
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess I wanted to rephrase my, my question.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], what was the project or what did the NAACP take on at this time when Sam Bolden [Samuel Bolden] was the president?
Speaker 2: As I remember it, Mr. Bolden and the branch at that time took on the responsibility of looking at heirs' property.  Because that is a major problem in the Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] community and wanted to find ways of getting heirs' property cleared up and he was in touch with the national office that sent students down that had expertise in land planning.  So that was the focus at that time.
Speaker 1: Oh okay, all right.  And when you say heirs' property, this is property that was just left to a number of heirs--
Speaker 2: Oh yes, yes, yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and they wanted to divide up the land, but they could not because?
Speaker 2: Because, because one, whomever name the land was in did not leave a will.  That's the main problem.  And because persons at that point and even today have a desire who are part of the heirs' property maybe to build a home or maybe to allow their children to build a home on the property.  Or they might want to do a business opportunity on their portion of the property.  So, those are one- some of the many reasons that, that, that, that was being considered.  And they are even valid today.
Story_ID: 532334
Speaker 1: So, now after you come back from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] and you're working and you've gotten married [to Allaphae Gantlin Barnwell], what happens next?  You go to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: No, I went to Fisk with summer activities after I went to work at Penn Center [St. Helena Island, South Carolina].  I took short courses over the period of years with Fisk, as well as University of Puerto Rico [San Juan, Puerto Rico], as well as University of Ontario [ph.], and, and other universities helping to prepare me better to do the job at Penn Center of being their field director for community development.  That was my next opportunity that I took advantage of.
Speaker 1: This Penn Center, is this the same as the Penn School [Penn Normal, Industrial and Agricultural School, St. Helena Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Yes, ri- well, yes.  The same--the name--school was eliminated when the services changed from a school, it went to Penn conference and community center [Penn Community Services].  And most local people refer to it as Penn Center (laughter).  Same place.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so what were your duties for Penn Center?
Speaker 2: Well, my duties range was very wide.  I did things like helping communities to prepare for change and school desegregation.  I helped the communities that, for example like Bluffton [South Carolina] had a problem of intestna- intestinal parasites, and the name of the parasite was Ascaris lumbricoides, that's an intestinal parasite that goes from the ground through the bottom of the foot or by hand to the mouth and get into the intestine.  And the worm will actually grow and suck all of the nutrition from the body and eventually cause the person to die.  And this was discovered in Bluffton in 1960 by a doctor named Donald Gatch, G-A-T-C-H, who was a local practicing physician in that area and verified by the local health department and the state health department.  And the part of the process of ridding the area and the individuals of that problem was to having safer sanitary facilities and safe water supply.  So, that's--those were only a part of my responsibility.  The other part of responsibility was to help communities to begin to look at community needs, whether it was school bus stop shelter for the children who would be standing in the rain in the mornings when the school bus was coming by to pick them up and, and they would be getting after the parents had gone to work and they'd be getting wet in the rain.  Or whether it was a desire to do extensive voter education and voter registration in the communities to be able to get more persons registered in order that they could make a change in their community as it relate to political action.
Story_ID: 532335
Speaker 1: And of course, part of my unwritten responsibility was to drive a car from Penn Center [St. Helena Island, South Carolina] to the airport in Savannah [Georgia] to pick up [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. occasionally along with his staff when they came to Penn Center to have conferences.  So, I had a wide range of (laughter) responsibilities.
Speaker 2: Well, do, do you remember any conversations you had with Dr. King?
Speaker 1: Oh yes, lots of them.
Speaker 2: You wanna share any?
Speaker 1: Well, maybe one or two yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Dr. King was fantastic, as the whole world knew that.  He would never let you go away without agreeing on whatever.  You didn't have to, you had to see his way and he would listen to you and you would come to some consensus, and that was his way.  But several times, we--he and I talked about when the transition occurred, when, whenever people began to look at the broader life.  I was afraid that we would have fewer black businesses, and black businesses that did exist would not have the financial capital entry into the bigger community to be able to expand as rapidly and as needed by the black businesses.  And he would always say, "Brother Barnwell [HistoryMaker Thomas Barnwell], you have to trust in the Lord."  I said, "Dr. King, the Lord is not gonna make those prejudice people open up their heart to make monies available immediately to black businesses." Yeah, you know, I was right.  You look around the world today, for example, in Atlanta [Georgia], during that time there were two major hotels in Atlanta, Wallahugie Waluhaje, Wallahugie hotel [Waluhaje Apartments, Atlanta, Georgia] and Paschal's [Paschal's Motor Hotel and Restaurant, Atlanta, Georgia].  Today, how many black owned hotels might be in Atlanta?  I can't answer you that question.
Speaker 2: All I know is Paschal's, well there's a couple other ones, but not--Paschal has sustained the times.
Speaker 1: But, the point is predominantly and of course you have to have, to go into any--to go into and to stay in any business, one must have the real desire internally to be able to do that and maintain it.  But, there are those financial problems that did exist, okay.  And I was partially correct, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: The other one was voter education and voter registration, which, which we always discussed.  And that was the second one.  And things have improved, but we had to go through an awful lot of processes in terms of making that happen.

Speaker 1: Working for the Penn Center [St. Helena Island, South Carolina], this service was for a number of counties?
Speaker 2: Only Beaufort County [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: Only Beaufort.
Speaker 2: It eventually spilled over a little bit in Jasper County [South Carolina] in later years, but through another method.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--so this was--what cities then, when you say county?
Speaker 2: This was, this was, this was county wide that--that there--at that time, the work was not concentrated in the City of Beaufort [South Carolina] with the except--with one exception, the vote--at that time, there was a Beaufort County voter registration activities ongoing headed up by Mr. James Richardson.  He was chairman of the Beaufort County Voters League to be very specific.  And part of my responsibility as outreach, not in a direct sense, indirect, was to help to gather information on a once a month basis from all of the outlying precincts, Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], Bluffton [South Carolina], Daufuskie [Daufuskie Island, South Carolina], Burton [South Carolina], Dale [South Carolina], Sheldon [South Carolina], Lobeco [South Carolina] and others to make sure that Mr. Richardson had on a once a month basis the accurate number of persons registered to vote from each of those communities.  And that's the one area that, that that tied into the one--the City of Beaufort.

Speaker 1: Speaking about Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], around this time in '63 [1963], he does the March on Washington.  What are your thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Frightening. (Laughter) I was frightened. I was frightened.  You know, because of the death that--
Speaker 1: Of Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) many deaths of people over the period of time and the beating of persons, I was, I was frightened because I just thought there would be a chaotic situation, but it didn't happen that way.  I was wrong about that.
Story_ID: 532338
Speaker 1: Well, what were thoughts about Kennedy's [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] death?
Speaker 2: Oh, shocking, disheartening, I don't know if there're words to even describe that.
Speaker 1: Because, did you, you were on the president's committee--
Speaker 2: To fulfill these rights.  And it was through serving on that committee that I met Thurgood Marshall and many other persons that I never would have had an opportunity to meet in my lifetime.
Speaker 1: What was that committee, what was the purpose?
Speaker 2: The purpose of that committee was to meet and give, through the committee process, suggestions, recommendations that the president and his committees could look at for improving some of the injustices that exist around the United States in all areas, housing, healthcare, errors of criminal justice, I mean there was no limit.
Speaker 1: Who else was on this committee with you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it's been so long.
Speaker 1: Okay, if you can't remember, that's fine.  But this was President Kennedy's committee to fulfill these rights, okay [sic.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were persons from states throughout the country and, and I just happened to be one of those from South Carolina.
Speaker 1: South Carolina, okay.
Speaker 2: I was the one from South Carolina selected.
Speaker 1: South Carolina, okay.  Do you remember any interaction with Thurgood Marshall or any conversations?
Speaker 2: Yes, he talked about the time of the South Carolina case, board of education case [Briggs v. Elliott, 1952] and how difficult that was and it was very interesting that he mentioned that at the last hours wee, wee hours in the morning he would say that fortunately somebody who they've had been talking with would come around and share positive information at that last minute that they didn't expect.  And that, you know, one must always have positive hope and faith that everybody is not really bad.  So, with that, I, I remember him very distinctly (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 532339
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you about the climate on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] at this time, as far as civil rights?  We hear a lot of stories about different parts of the countries--country about the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and lynchings, was any of that going on in Hilton Head?
Speaker 2: To my knowledge no.  We did not have Klan activities on Hilton Head.  And rallies and lynching to my knowledge did not go on Hilton--Hilton Head was an area that the majority of the population during that time was minority of Negroes.  During my lifetime there were up to--when I was a boy growing up, they were up to two thousand five hundred persons of color living here on Hilton Head.  And, and the white population, I can remember in my lifetime on Hilton Head and even prior to the bridge, close to prior to the bridge, I can remember back when there were seven white people living on Hilton Head, that's all.  Now that population changed as the years went about, but we had the majority for many years.  We had the majority of residents who were of color here on Hilton Head.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're gonna talk a little bit more about that in a little bit.
Story_ID: 532340
Speaker 1: Let's see, in '63 [1963] you also do some studies at West Indies?
Speaker 2: Yeah, University of West Indies [University of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica].  That was through the community development program that Fred [Fred Wale] and Carmen Wale [sic. Carmen Isales], who work with the ministry, the government of Puerto Rico.  And they had a program there to improve water, sanitary facilities, as well as roads throughout the island of Puerto Rico and it was thought that through the collaboration of Penn [Penn Center, St. Helena Island, South Carolina], it would benefit me to go and, and, and study that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And learn how to do that.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, and I did.  It was very beneficial.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then Ontario [University of Ontario (ph.)] in Bethel--in Bethel, Maine?
Speaker 2: That was group dynamics and interpersonal relationship.  That was only a summer pro- about a month program (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) A summer program.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 532341
Speaker 1: So what year was it that you leave Penn Community Center--Services [Penn Community Services; Penn Center, St. Helena Island, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: It was sixty--
Speaker 1: Sixty-seven [1967]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, '67 [1967].  Went to EOC [Beaufort Jasper Economic Opportunity Commission Inc.].
Speaker 1: You went to the EOC?
Speaker 2: Was it EOC, Economic Opportunity Commission or Beaufort Jasper Comprehensive Health Services [Beaufort-Jasper-Hampton Comprehensive Health Services, Inc., Ridgeland, South Carolina]?
Speaker 1: Okay, I think you--I think it says for the Beaufort Jasper Hampton Economic Opportunity Commission.  And what was your job there?
Speaker 2: Well the Beaufort Jasper Comprehensive Health Services is when I, I had my greatest at home experience.  EOC was an interim step prior to Comprehensive Health.  The economic opportunity commission was, was, was a spin off to the national, then President Johnson [President Lyndon Baines Johnson] economic opportunity program to begin to look at helping communities throughout the country that had specific poverty problems and starting of community centers, community daycare and, and, and some job opportunities, the Job Corps and such programs as that.  And from that, then I went to the Beaufort Jasper, I helped--I worked with the Federation Southern Cooperative [sic. Federation of Southern Cooperatives] as a short timeframe in between there working with helping to organize and develop cooperatives here in this area, Beaufort County [South Carolina], as well as when they needed, they pulled me out to go to Mississippi and other places.  Then after that, a cooperative experience, then I, I, I went full time with the volunteer service for about a year in volunteering to organize the Organization to Prevent Hunger and Malnutrition, it's not on my resume, but, but that's what it's called.  And then it folded in--they changed the name and folded it into the Beaufort Jasper Comprehensive Health Services and that's when I really enjoyed developing--helping the communities throughout Beaufort and Jasper County [South Carolina] to organize neighborhoods throughout these two communities into target--into nineteen target areas for the purpose of putting together a comprehensive healthcare program, and when I say comprehensive, starting from the transportation need to the community health worker need where someone would come into their homes.  This is pre-home healthcare service time.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Like, 'cause we're talking ab- this is like 1970?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay.  And, and, and then the dental care in a dental environment.  The clinical care prenatal, postnatal, as well as in-hospital care, as well as mental health, as well as speech and hearing, as well as any other referral services that would be needed.  And, and, and getting into the area of talking with the persons that would begin to plan the dialysis needs for the area who would operate dialysis clinics.
Speaker 1: Okay, wow.
Speaker 2: That was fascinating.
Speaker 1: I guess so.  Because this was a development for people of what income?
Speaker 2: All low income, starting with low income.  And as a result of that, I went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] worked on a master's [degree] program for about a year and a half on, on a weekend flying in once a month.  And I did not finish the program because it got so cold in Michigan, University of Michigan that I told them they could keep their degree.  And they threatened me that after--if I did get the degree, they were gonna move me to Washington, and I said no, I have no interest, so bye-bye, I'm gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you stay with the Comprehensive Health Services and that was in--this was in Ridgeland [South Carolina], where in South Carolina (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well Ridgeland was the addre- the main address.
Speaker 1: Was the address, the main address.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you stay there for ten years?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 532342
Speaker 1: And so, what happens after you leave there [Beaufort Jasper Comprehensive Health Services; Beaufort-Jasper-Hampton Comprehensive Health Services, Inc., Ridgeland, South Carolina] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) After that I went into banking.  I, I--they recruited me to become the regional director for the National Consumer Cooperative Bank.  And they said--and, and they wanted me, so I said I'm not gonna move to Atlanta [Georgia].  I'm gonna stay in South Carolina.  So, I had a discussion with then, Senator Fritz Hollings [Ernest Hollings] and Senator Thurmond [Strom Thurmond].  And they then talked with the regional--with the state--I mean not the state, the national office in Washington [D.C.].  And they made arrangement, political arrangement for the regional office to be in Charleston, South Carolina.  And I was the regional director for about two years.  And then after that, I got tired running behind airplanes and I came back home.
Story_ID: 532343
Speaker 1: And what did you do then?
Speaker 2: I then started plans to develop my family owned properties and spend time with my aging mother [Hanna White Barnwell], grandmother and uncle.  And began to spend more time with, with my son, a younger son, because by then I was remarried.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was your, your--you had one son with your first marriage [to Allaphae Gantlin Barnwell]?
Speaker 2: No, I had two children with the first marriage, and one son (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are their names?
Speaker 2: The name of the two older children are Thomas Barnwell III, and Paulette Barnwell Ervin, and the younger son with the second marriage name is Jason Sydney Barnwell [Jason Barnwell].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so you say you start to develop your family business and what business is this?
Speaker 2: I started developing the apartments.  I had already done some preliminaries on starting the mobile home park that, that is on family property that I, I own now that was owned by the family earlier.  And then I started working aggressively in developing Sylby Tub Apartments [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  This is an apartment complex that's financed by using, using Farmers Home [Farmers Home Administration] funds--Farmers Home a federal--a division of the federal government.  And it's, it's geared to low to moderate income families.  And on that complex of 3.28 acres of land, I put in eighteen apartment complex--or eighteen units--
Speaker 1: Eighteen units, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --eighteen units.  And public sewer, it was quite a challenge, because public sewer was not available and so I had to do it on septic tanks, which is al- almost unheard of thing, but I went through all the challenges because by that time I had already, you know, connections with people at state level and, and it met all of the required tests.
Story_ID: 532349
Speaker 1: So, go ahead and, and tell me about the other properties that you own and about your fam- you--as far as your family business?
Speaker 2: Okay.  The family owned properties that I have developed include the next apartment complex that I did was Cedar Well Apartment [Cedar Well Apartments, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], and that is on the similar funding as Sylby Tub [Sylby Tub Apartments, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  But there are more units, there are twenty-four units in that complex.  And then after, after Cedar Well, I did--I discovered that there was a need for single family houses.  And I then got some land from my cousin, she's deceased, Ruth Jones [Ruth Jones Chisholm].  And I developed what is now Wild Horse Court [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], which is a single family development, which is more than twenty-eight houses.  And moderate income families were able to get into those houses on Hilton Head Island [South Carolina] at that time for about eighty-five thousand five hundred dollars.
Speaker 1: So this was open to--only to natives?
Speaker 2: No, everybody (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, anybody, okay.
Speaker 2: No, no everybody, no, no, no.  Housing you can't discriminate (laughter).  There's no discrimination (laughter).  No.
Speaker 1: No I just thought maybe there was a, a push to help, you know, I thought it was something to help the natives who--
Speaker 2: Natives, yes.  But it was and still is open to whomever have a--had a desire for housing.  And then my cousin Bessie [ph.] had 3.28 acres not far from there.  And she liked what was on the ground, so she came to me one day and said, "You know, I'd like to do over there what you were able to do over at Wild Horse Court."  And I said, "Well let's sit down and talk about it."  And she and I formed a development and I put in my expertise and she put in the land.  And we did nine houses on her land and she was happy with the development, so we've done that.  And of course, I--after that, I, I talked with my family members that had--we owned some land on the waterfront on Hilton Head on the intercostal waterway.  And we, for some time, talked about how can we make the land meaningful and keep [paternal] grandmother's [Georgianna Miller Barnwell] concept of keeping the land in the family in perpetuity.  So we put together a limited liability corporation, what's referred to as an LLC.  Put all of our land into one company and of course, in their situation, their land was still in heirs because their father and mother both had passed and we found a legal way to move the land from the heir portion directly into the limited liability corporation.  So, we now have the Barnwell Family Associates, LLC that's leasing land to a company that's building timeshare on the land, we lease it for forty-five years.  And after the end of the forty-five years, the land comes back to us with everything on it.  And the buildings were so design and place that after the forty-fifth year, forty-fifth year, all they have to work on are interlocking utility water, sewer lines, electric lines utilization.  So, we're very pleased with that.  It's the first on Hilton Head Island and possibly the first in the State of South Carolina as a long term opportunity like that.  And we know it's the first for minorities or black folks on Hilton Head, there's no question about that.
Story_ID: 532350
Speaker 1: Well, let's talk about the change on, on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], because of course this is a great change.  What could you tell me about Sea Pines [Sea Pines Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] and--and the development of these plantations that have taken over Hilton Head?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the, the developers came fifty plus years ago.  And their concept was, I guess what is was, to take, you know, the land that they bought to develop it, make an awful lot of money and that apparently they did.  It's--looking back at it, I can only say that I had hoped that our parents at that time had the vision to demand at the growth, early growth pattern of those development more adjustment activities for native people, which did not happen.  And as a result of not having that, we today have seen a major land loss in the community of--we've seen taxes going up as a result of the development of Sea Pines, Hilton Head Plantation [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] they refer to it as Indigo Run [Indigo Run Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], Port Royal [Port Royal Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina], on and on and on, on Hilton Head.  Spanish Royal Plantation [sic. Spanish Wells Plantation, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  We've seen taxes going up all around the areas that are traditionally minority or black owned properties.  We've seen the taxes just going through the roof so to speak.  And as a result of that, the families that owned the land five, ten years ago and some today, are selling their land.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing, that's an individual family choice and they have the right to do with their land what they want to do.  However, I will say those who are selling, the heritage, culture and some of the long range vision that those foreparents had are gone.  We'll never be able to buy--re- repurchase those parcels that are, that are gone.  And of course, we have not had a program in place that allows all of those families who decide to sell to instantly put that land in a developmental mode at the level that would be meaningful for the family to see a massive change.  Now on a personal basis, what my family is doing is something that could possibly catch on.  There are two other families on the island that's doing something similar now, which I'm happy about.  But it could have grown so much faster.  And the other part of the problem is that the town of Hilton Head has come in with the requirements of land use that are extremely difficult to meet.  The setback requirements, the requirements on height, the requirements on drainage, the, the requirements of meeting the southern building codes today based on hurricane and other related activities.  They are extremely difficult.  So these are some of the challenges that, that, that's here today as a result of the famous Sea Pines, the famous other many areas that are developed on Hilton Head.
Story_ID: 532351
Speaker 1: So, the stories that the big developers came in and just took the land from the people, that's not all the way accurate is it?
Speaker 2: Some of it was taken, apparently some of it was taken.  The--there, there's, there's the Ferguson tract that we referred to was--there was a contract signed, legal, to my knowledge there was a legal contract signed on that land.  However, at a time in history, while the land was under contract the economy changed and the family apparently from what I'm told never did get all of their monies and there was apparently no clause in the contract to allow the family to redeem the land.  So, therefore, that's one we can point to as, and this was a fifty acre tract that's today owned by the town of Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  Now, there're those of us that are experiencing extreme pressure from the neighbors around us where they say through legal maneuvers we cannot tell which one of these lots might be yours or ours, but it appears that ours is prevailing.  So, we have those and, and this is, this is the slippery kind of problems that we are experiencing between our county mapping department and what actually exists out there on the ground.
Story_ID: 532352
Speaker 1: I'm still a little fuzzy, because at one time Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] was majority black folks, so of course they owned most of the land, is that not right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That is correct.
Speaker 1: That's not--okay.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: All right, I understand that there was a company that came in and bought the timber rights and is this how this whole thing started?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  They came originally to buy the, the family--Hack [Fred C. Hack] and Fraser [Charles E. Fraser] originally came to buy the timber.  And this was during the time of the Thorne [Landon K. Thorne] and Loomis [Alfred L. Loomis] era of Hilton Head land ownership.  Then after being here, buying the timber, then the young lawyer named Charles Fraser saw the economic opportunity aspect.  And he got his father excited, apparently to buy the first five thousand acres, which--five thousand two hundred, or more or less--which is where Sea Pines [Sea Pines Plantation,  Hilton Head Island, South Carolina] is now located.  And then, other things started happening after that.  Now, at one point in time, native people did own or did purchase land close to and apart of the Sea Pines, what is now referred to Sea Pines area.  We are coming across through some research that some of us are doing, which will not turn things around of course, that there are minority persons that did own lands in certain areas that is now massively developed.  Yes, that is true.  Now how did they change land, I don- I can't answer that.  Also, we're coming across the fact that in other sections on the island back in the 1800s blacks did own up to two hundred acres in certain spots.  But we, we can't verify how did they lose it that far back.  Whether it was because of payments not made or, or what.  But we--we see that in some records, yes.  But it was like two hundred acres here, a hundred acres there, 250 acres, and then there were records referred to smaller tracts.  So, you're partially right.
Story_ID: 532353
Speaker 1: You're writing a book about all of this, is that right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) The book is being written, yes.  It will cover some of this, yes.  It will also cover some areas pertaining to the early era or the time of Port Royal experience [sic. Port Royal Experiment].  The first mandatory school that was--for education that was on Hilton Head [Hilton Head Island, South Carolina].  It will cover the locations.  Hopefully, we can get the majority of the locations of the native cemeteries on Hilton Head.  Hopefully, we can cover the timing of the period that--that plantation owners left Hilton Head and native people were the custodians of Hilton Head that fish, farm and hunt to survive on the island.  And yes, the book will cover many of those areas.
Story_ID: 532354
Speaker 1: Going back to developers, do you know much about Sun City [Sun City Hilton Head, South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No.  Except I can only say that to my knowledge Sun City got the blessings of the county council not to allow them with certain kinds of school taxes in order that it would not have created a problem when there was a need to have referendums to, to increase the tax demand.  That apparently was made as some special deal with the Sun City developers at that time.  And of course the other problem of Sun City, that Sun City brought, because there was a need for labor in this area to move those--to build those houses very rapidly, the company that had some contacts someplace in Arizona or somewhere with the Spanish speaking labor market, it was agreed that they would look at bringing the Spanish speaking people here to this area because they were trained to move, move very rapidly in getting those houses built.  And now we have a, a growing, a super growing Spanish speaking community.  And growing so rapid until we can't keep up with healthcare costs, schools and other community needs.
Speaker 1: How do you think that's gonna change how the island, the traditions of the island, as far as the Gullah traditions or--and, and now you have this, I guess it's mostly Mexican or Spanish speaking traditions.  How's that gonna change the makeup of the, the island?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it has changed it already.  The big concern is what will it do, as I see it, what will it do to the culture.  How will it change the Gullah culture to what extend we will be able to hold onto that.  And how can we put things in place now that it preserved the Gullah cou- culture ten, fifteen, twenty years or a hundred years from now that what we're talking about today my great-great-great-great-great-children infinitive will be able to say, we are still here and we're still a part of this.  I am not sure how we can capture that today just as I'm not sure what happened that the fathers, the grandfathers, the great-grandfathers--and they had no knowledge that all of this would've possibly happen.  When they put their--they thought about heirs' property, they thought it would be heirs' property in perpetuity.  But that has changed.  So, now I'm concerned.  How can we preserve the Gullah culture that it will be with us in perpetuity?  I don't have the answer, but I, I want to do something about protecting, preserving it and making sure that it goes on forever.

Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not spoken about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: No.  I wanna thank you very much.

Speaker 2: My (laughter) I want my legacy to be the community meddler (laughter).  The guy that went around meddling people all the time.  Who was always happy about meddling, that's what I want it to be.
Story_ID: 532357
Speaker 1: And since this information is for the future generations, what one message would you want to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: Education is critical and land preservation is more critical.  And one must learn as much about one's culture as one possibly can and pass it on to the next generation.
Speaker 1: Great.  To give us your story, it's been very inspirational and educational, and I'm sure it will be for the future generations as well.
