JW: Okay, so I&#8217;m going to just introduce us and then we can get started. This is Jessie Wilkerson and I&#8217;m with the Southern Oral History Program, and I am interviewing Barb Greene. We are in Williamsburg, Kentucky, and the date is May eighth, 2011. So Barb, can you start off by saying when you were born and where you were born?
BG: I was born in Greencastle, Indiana in 1951. It was a rural community. I lived in a rural community, a farming community.
JW: Can you tell me a little bit about your childhood?
BG: Dad was a truck driver. He worked for the Mayflower Trucking Company. So he moved people. Everywhere he moved somebody, he wanted to live. He wanted to move us, too. Mom was a little resistant to that. Eventually, I guess they separated probably when I was about seven years old, and I lived with my grandmother in Indiana for a long time, several years, and then my mom lived in Indianapolis. So I moved to Indianapolis and that&#8217;s where I graduated. I didn&#8217;t graduate high school, [but] that&#8217;s where I went to high school. Yeah.
JW: Can you describe your parents a little bit for me?
BG: Yeah, I can. My dad, he was an interesting guy. He kind of worked on the barter system. We was farmers and we didn&#8217;t have a lot of money, but-
JW: We can pause for a minute.  (break in conversation)
BG: Dad had a trucker and so he would plow somebody&#8217;s field and they would come over and help him dig a well, or he would work on somebody&#8217;s, he was always working on somebody&#8217;s car. So he would be working on somebody&#8217;s car and then they&#8217;d do something for our family in return. So it was kind of a bartering system. I remember that about Dad. He always had the mouth of the car open, always, always. And Mom, she was a flaming redhead, spunky. She had to work. Dad was gone a lot, so Mom had to work. She worked at a restaurant on Highway 40 in Plainfield, Indiana, and it was called Rusty and Osie&#8217;s Stop and Smile. And they would fix these meals. There was no menu. You just stopped and ate whatever they had fixed. I remember going there. Mom always smelled like restaurant. The parking lot would be full of semi[-truck drivers] that would just stop and eat because it was like getting a meal, going home and getting a meal.   (break in conversation)
JW: Okay, so you were telling me about your mom working in the restaurant.
BG: Yeah. She worked at home too. Some of the things that I remember about Mom, is that what you want to know?
JW: Yeah.
BG: Some of the things I remember about Mom is where we lived, I mean, it really was rural and there was a creek. We had a driveway, but you had to drive down into the creek and up the other bank to get to the house, and when it would rain, you couldn&#8217;t get out. But Mom used, the rocks were white, real, real, white rocks. I don&#8217;t know what that is, limestone maybe. But anyway, I remember Mom, we didn&#8217;t have a washing machine and she&#8217;d be down there washing clothes on those rocks and stuff. I have this visual of her doing that. I can still see her doing that. And blackberry picking. We would have Kool-Aid picnics and we&#8217;d take a jug of Kool-Aid and we&#8217;d tie them to us and a blanket and we&#8217;d go out into the woods, all six of us, and we&#8217;d go blackberry picking and stuff. And then when we got hungry, we&#8217;d sit down and we&#8217;d drink Kool-Aid and eat some of those blackberries that we picked before we gone back. Mom was a strong woman, very strong.   She raised us practically by herself. Dad wasn&#8217;t real big on monogamy, so Mom was kind of the one, the post, the rock of the family, and everything kind of rotated around her. She was a hard worker. Mom worked really, really hard and she didn&#8217;t graduate school, but education was extremely important. It was important to her that we finish school. And she was a writer. She used to write poetry and beautiful, beautiful poetry, nothing ever published. She just used to write, usually about us kids and life and family and things like that, nature and things like that. She wrote one called &#8220;Mother Nature&#8217;s Dress.&#8221; I can&#8217;t recall it, but it was just absolutely beautiful. She wanted to be, secretly, I think she wanted to be a journalist, but she never got to be.   She was so smart. She was extremely intelligent. Let&#8217;s see. She was very opinionated, and she would do things like write letters to the editor if she didn&#8217;t think something was right, things like that. And even when she was older, when we&#8217;d go into the grocery store, she&#8217;d go up and question the manager about prices of things and things like that. She was something. She was something. She was a strong woman. She was a survivor. And we had a big garden, which is what we used to live on, and she canned. She could cook anything, utilized the land wisely, and would never take anything out she didn&#8217;t put back. If she cut a tree, she planted a tree. She was just kind of that way.  And Dad, he moved to Texas and got remarried down there, but in his about ten or twelve years before he died, he really helped organize a community down there. It was called Pelican Bay. But they built this community. It was just like a co-op. The whole community was just like a co-op and they owned everything collectively, I mean from the water tower to everything. So it was kind of cool and they had built a church. They didn&#8217;t even have, I mean, when he died, the building was done, but the land hadn&#8217;t grown back and stuff yet. They buried him in that. That&#8217;s where his funeral was, at that church, which is kind of cool because that was a side of Dad I don&#8217;t think I got to see as a kid. But he was active in the community. Now Mom was active individually.  JW: Did you have a sense of them being politically active?  BG: Yes, my mom&#8217;s father was a politician. He was a trustee at the school and my mom used to tell these stories about how all that worked, which was not too good. There was a lot of what I would consider bad politics: bribery and buying votes and stuff like that. Mom would talk about it. It&#8217;s hard to imagine just how that might be back then. I mean, I would have thought that there was--. Anyway, it&#8217;s just different. It&#8217;s just different.   JW: And can you tell me a little bit about your schooling and what grade school was like for you?  BG: Grade school, I had a hard time. I had a hard time. I didn&#8217;t have--. I didn&#8217;t have   a big set of friends or anything. I kind of kept to myself and got in a lot of fights in school. There was this one girl. I won&#8217;t say her name, but there was this one girl and she was really ostracized, I mean, horrible, even worse than me. I felt really sorry for her and that was probably the first time that I really kind of went, &#8220;Wait a minute. Something&#8217;s not right.&#8221; I brought her to spend the night at our house, and Mom was so mad at me because she brought bedbugs with her and so Mom was furious. But anyway, I got in a lot of fights over her, that one particular girl, and I can&#8217;t remember if she moved away or I moved away or what happened. So that was kind of grade school was just I just went along mostly. We weren&#8217;t allowed out a lot, like out in the community a lot. Mom kept us pretty close to home, which was interesting because as a very young child, we could just go in the woods and just roam and we did just roam in the woods and stuff and did all kinds of crazy stuff. But when we lived in the city, Mom wouldn&#8217;t allow us away from the house.
JW: Do you have a sense of why she didn&#8217;t want you out?
BG: Yeah, I think she was worried. I think it was around what she perceived was a safety issue because it was Indianapolis. It wasn&#8217;t in the best neighborhood, as Mom would say. It was in a neighborhood which there was a lot of population and there was a lot of confusion. They were desegregating at the time, and there was no bus system. You had to ride the city buses. You know what I&#8217;m saying? So moving from an extremely rural area to concrete everywhere and all of these things we didn&#8217;t really understand, I think Mom was worried about our safety.
JW: Do you remember how you felt about that move from a rural area to the city?
BG: Yeah, I hated it. (laughs) I remember that. I hated it. It was horrible. My whole life changed. I had been living with my grandmother. It was just what I would have considered a childhood dream in terms of what a child can do and see, wading in creeks, climbing trees, and going for walks in the woods, to just being pretty confined and just sidewalks and streets everywhere. We had, oh my gosh, I don&#8217;t know, way bigger than the property you see here that we had to roam and then in Indianapolis, we would sit or I could reach out my bedroom window and touch the window of the house next door. I mean, it was that kind of--. There was no yard. There was nothing. Yeah, no, I didn&#8217;t like it.
JW: And you said it was Indianapolis?
BG: That was in Indianapolis, yeah.
JW: What were the demographics of the neighborhood that you were living in?
BG: Well, the street we lived on was called North Walcott, and it was an older part of town. Indianapolis, they kind of built a little hub and then they just kind of spread out from that, but it was part of that original hub that was built. I&#8217;m trying to think. There were just people everywhere. The main street was Washington Street and that was like a main artery through Indianapolis and on the other side of it, it had a park, but we could never go there because it was a safety issue. But on ours, it was just rows of houses that were just right next to each other and just nothing. The inside of your house was all you had. You didn&#8217;t really have any outside.
JW: And you said desegregation was starting?
BG: Desegregation was-
JW: Was that in your school?
BG: Yeah, I went to Northwest High School and that was in Indianapolis, and it was at a time when they were desegregating and there was just a lot of confusion on the parts of us as children, as young adults. It was just totally confusing. One day, you might see black and white people rolling out there, fighting, and the next day, you might see another group of black and white people standing around socializing and talking. I mean, it was just very, a lot of contradictions. It had to be much harder for people of color than it was for me, I&#8217;m sure, because they never knew how they were going to be received from one day to the next. But there was a lot of confusion on our part about what was going to happen, safety, things like that that I had never dealt with before. And high school had all these kids. I don&#8217;t even remember, I can&#8217;t remember two of them from that high school, two of those kids. It was just nobody. It was just nobody, very individual. Do you understand what I&#8217;m saying? My life, me, and nothing about community or lots of friendships and things like that. And maybe another group might have had that.
JW: So you really were kind of an outsider watching these things unfold?
BG: Yeah, I was more like an observer. That&#8217;s exactly how I would describe it. I was an observer all through school really. And I would get engaged here and there. I remember I got really engaged with the athletic program, and I ran track. I remember that and I liked that a lot, but it doesn&#8217;t seem like that was for a long time, maybe a year or two, that I got to do that. They kind of phased those things out when I was in high school. I remember that. No cheerleader, no football, basketball, none of that stuff. I was not, that was totally somebody else&#8217;s life. That had nothing to do with me.
JW: Did you start dating when you were in high school?
BG: Mom moved over into like an urban neighborhood, which was still, all these houses were still close together, but you did have a little bit of a yard, I don&#8217;t know, maybe a forty-foot yard in the front and in the back. I got to ride a bicycle around that neighborhood on that street, just on that street. I started dating. I got to go to the prom. That&#8217;s my first date was going to the prom with this guy Mom had hooked me up with because Mom thought he was a safe guy, which he wasn&#8217;t. He wasn&#8217;t safe at all, but Mom thought he was. At the time, I didn&#8217;t care because as long as I got to go to the prom. (18:59) And I wound up marrying him because I was pregnant with Penny, but that was short-lived.
JW: Had you had much experience with sex education before that?
BG: No, there was no such thing. There was no such thing. What Mama told me, which was pretty strange. Here comes a grandson. This is Justin. No, I&#8217;m sorry. My tags are expired, Justin.
Justin: You got any money for gas?
BG: No.
Justin: I&#8217;m like on empty right now, like really running on empty. What are you doing?
BG: This is Jessie.
JW: Hi.
BG: This is Justin. Justin is my grandson.
Justin: You still haven&#8217;t told me what you&#8217;re doing yet.
BG: That I raised.
Justin: You&#8217;re still not telling me what you&#8217;re doing.
BG: She&#8217;s doing an interview. It&#8217;s for a project.
Justin: You sure you don&#8217;t have gas, like ten dollars or something?
BG: Justin, I don&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t have it, honey. I&#8217;m sorry.
Justin: I&#8217;ll pray I don&#8217;t run out of gas before I get there.
BG: Where are you going, to Mandy&#8217;s?
Justin: I&#8217;ll bring her over here today because I couldn&#8217;t bring her yesterday and today is Mother&#8217;s day.
BG: You need to wait and bring her this afternoon.
Justin: What time?
BG: About--?
Justin: I don&#8217;t know how long her mom&#8217;s going to wait for her presents.
BG: No, you need to wait and bring her this afternoon about one thirty. He&#8217;s not mine, but I raised him. He&#8217;s Tiffany&#8217;s oldest one. I carried him all over Appalachia, too.
JW: That&#8217;s great.
BG: But anyway, I forget where we were. I&#8217;m sorry.
JW: You were telling me about-
BG: Just rambling on over here.
JW: You became pregnant with your first child-
BG: Oh yeah.
JW: At what age?
BG: Sixteen, sixteen. She was born when I was seventeen. I didn&#8217;t even want to marry this guy. I didn&#8217;t really want to marry him, but I needed to get away from my stepfather, and so I married him and we moved to Texas, which was where my dad was. Penny was born in Texas and then shortly after that, I left him and I came back. Yeah, I came back. He did, too. He died when he was twenty-four of alcohol poisoning. He had some problems, which I didn&#8217;t, it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered. I&#8217;d have still married him probably because I needed to get out of home. I needed to get away from it. But anyway.
JW: Well, if this is too personal, just tell me.
BG: No, it&#8217;s okay.
JW: Why did you need to get out of the house?
BG: Because my stepfather was abusive.
JW: To you?
BG: Yeah.
JW: Was he to other people in the home as well?
BG: Yeah, my two sisters, both of them. I was the last. So I was getting out one way or the other.
JW: Did your mom know?
BG: You know, I tried to tell her, but she just couldn&#8217;t believe that. She just couldn&#8217;t believe it. It was just not acceptable to her at all. And she stayed with him after I left, which was okay. She did what she needed to do. I&#8217;m okay with that, but I didn&#8217;t, and I was okay with that too. It was worth it. Rick was worth it.
JW: To get out?
BG: To get out from under that. That was not doable anymore.
JW: And were you able to finish high school?
BG: No, I dropped out. See, I just got married.
JW: When you went to Texas.
BG: Yeah, I just got married. I dropped out of school and got married. At that time, you didn&#8217;t go to school pregnant. So I knew I needed to drop out. They wouldn&#8217;t have let me go anyway. So I dropped out before I showed too badly.
JW: What was that like realizing that you were pregnant?
BG: Terrifying, to be sure. Our family didn&#8217;t believe in abortions or anything like that. You had to see it through. Mom had suggested that I give birth to it and have somebody adopt it, which I couldn&#8217;t do, I couldn&#8217;t do. Anyway, Mom wound up taking care of Penny anyway because Rick was very abusive, and I got afraid he was going to hurt Penny. I didn&#8217;t have anywhere else to go. I was out of options. So I called. I remember standing in a phone booth with Penny in my arm, calling Mom and asking Mom can Penny come stay with her? And I could not go back because he was still there. He wouldn&#8217;t let me come back. I guess he probably knew I knew too much and maybe I might convince her somehow.
JW: So he was abusive to you? The guy that you married was abusive to you?
BG: Yeah, yeah. He was physically abusive to me. His family was messed up, man. I dated this guy twice and then I married him. It&#8217;s not like we had this courtship. You know what I&#8217;m saying?
JW: Right.
BG: So anyway, and then later on, they had committed him. I didn&#8217;t know. See, I didn&#8217;t realize. I didn&#8217;t realize he was in trouble. He&#8217;d been in trouble. He had legal issues. I didn&#8217;t know him enough to know any of that stuff. I just saw him as a ticket out. So him and I separated. And that&#8217;s when I met Denise&#8217;s father. I&#8217;d met him in the time of all that because I was basically homeless. I mean, there was no such thing as homelessness back then, but yes, there was. So I got with him, and I got pregnant. They&#8217;re two years apart. I stayed close enough that Mom would bring Penny to me to see, so I could still see her and stuff. And then her and her husband did separate. Apparently, he was sleeping with his boss&#8217;s wife, too, or something. Mom, for some reason, that connected and she was able to put him aside and so when that happened, every chance I got, I either moved in or next door to Mom so I could be close to Penny.   In the time of all that, my brother was in the Navy, the oldest brother was in the Navy, and he lived in California. I guess through conversations with Mom, he found out that I was kind of just homeless. Back then, they called it a vagrant. I don&#8217;t know what they call it now, homeless now. Back then, it was a vagrant. So he had gotten me word that I needed to come to California. So I left and went to California. I was pregnant when I left, and I enrolled in beauty school. (laughs) Beauty school. I was going to be a cosmetologist, but I didn&#8217;t finish. I didn&#8217;t finish. Mom got sick in Indiana. I had taken Penny with me and I had Denise, and Mom got sick and so we flew back to Indiana. So she&#8217;d had a stroke, and he was gone. So I flew back to take care of her and that&#8217;s how I got back to Indiana from California.
JW: What year was this?
BG: Let&#8217;s see.   Justin: Grandma?  BG: Hang on.
[Exchange with Justin]
BG: No, it&#8217;s not, Justin. Honey, I&#8217;m busy.
Justin: Okay. I guess I&#8217;ll go get Mandy.
BG: Alright. Where are you going?
Justin: To get Mandy.
BG: What for?
Justin: To spend time with her, then come over here.
BG: About one thirty. Okay, I love you, hound dog. Happy mother&#8217;s day, Mamaw!
Justin: Not until you get your present.
BG: Not until I get you your present, that&#8217;s funny. He&#8217;s so funny. But anyway, I forget where I was. I don&#8217;t remember now.
JW: I was asking what year was this when you had gone out to California. Around what time was that?
BG: Oh yeah. Let&#8217;s see. I was seventeen when I lived in Texas, eighteen when I came back. I was probably eighteen or nineteen when I was to California. It was probably about six months that I was a vagrant and then I went to California. So it was close. I flew out there. That was the first time I&#8217;d ever been on an airplane. I was terrified and excited, too.
JW: Now where were you finding places to sleep and getting food when you didn&#8217;t have a home?
BG: I worked. I worked at, I don&#8217;t know if they still have them anymore, but it was called Burger Chef. I don&#8217;t know if you remember them or not.
JW: No.
BG: It was kind of like Burger King, only this was Burger Chef. It was a fast food restaurant and at that time, they didn&#8217;t have the bathrooms on the inside of the restaurants. They were on the outside of the restaurants, and so I would take a bath in that bathroom because they didn&#8217;t lock them. So I would take a bath in there. I&#8217;d just lock the door and take a bath in there, and wash my uniform. It was some salmon-colored ridiculous-looking thing, but you had to wear it. That&#8217;s where I done my laundry. I&#8217;d like walk around, walk around stores, the all-night stores of the night until they run me off. I might sleep in that bathroom sometimes or I might find a parked car somewhere and I might sleep in there.
JW: Was that your first job was at the Burger Chef? Is that what it&#8217;s called?
BG: The Burger Chef. No, my first job was when I was fifteen and that was at Kresge&#8217;s, which evolved into K-Mart, but it was a little, small dime store. That&#8217;s where I worked first. I didn&#8217;t work there long. It was hard to manage the bus system and all of that kind of stuff, and Mom didn&#8217;t like me on the bus system and stuff. She didn&#8217;t want me to work there, so I quit.
JW: So how did you end up getting here?
BG: Down here?
JW: Yeah.
BG: Well, after Tiffany was born. She was born in Indiana. I was probably about twenty-one when Tiffany was born. I was about twenty-one, maybe twenty-two. A friend of mine, a friend of Mom&#8217;s was originally from down here and her son lives down here and he was in trouble. This woman needed to come down here and check on him, and she asked if I would come with her. Along the way, the first time I laid eyes on the mountains, I just married them. It was like, &#8220;Oh my God. This is where I&#8217;m supposed to be.&#8221; So I kept coming down, going back and forth with her because she was up and down the road a lot with him. And then I met a man from the mountains, and I married him and moved down there to Tennessee. I moved to Tennessee, Campbell County, Tennessee. That&#8217;s when I ran into the Crazy Quilt and the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange. That was my encounter with them. At the time, they were-[really, Justin?] At the time, we bought our clothing. They called it the &#8220;rag store,&#8221; but that&#8217;s where I bought clothes for the kids and stuff. My husband was a coal miner. He was working. He worked at a coal tipple, at the tipple where they ran the coal and put them on the coal (35:08) and did all that.   I was just a housewife. That&#8217;s what I was doing, raising kids, but I would go there, and I would hear because they would be talking what was happening in the community and stuff like that. So I would hear some of the things that were happening, and I heard about they had this huge plan to put a senior housing development on this strip mine bench. I kept hearing about all of the reasons why they shouldn&#8217;t do that and how it was so dangerous and things like that. Because I just, when I came down here, everybody was coal and I didn&#8217;t know, or timber. And so the more I heard about that, the more concerned I got for my kids, what was going to happen. It was wildcat stripping, and they were destroying the water tables and destroying people&#8217;s land and everybody that I did know, which was basically his family, which was huge, they would say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything. You need to keep quiet. You don&#8217;t need to say anything. They&#8217;ll burn you down. This will happen. That will happen.&#8221; All these bad things that would happen. So I was kind of in the middle of that.  And then I had moved my mom to Tennessee, put her in a trailer there beside me so I could take care of her. And I was taking her to the store, and we come upon this huge car accident. I mean, it was a bad car accident and nobody was doing anything. That flipped me out because this guy was just wandering around bleeding all over. And Mom was like, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it. You&#8217;ll get sued. You&#8217;ll get sued.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Mom.&#8221; So I went and got him, put him back in his car because I didn&#8217;t know what else to do with him and sat and waited for the ambulance to get there and it took them forty-five minutes to come three miles. So at that point, I was pissed. I was hot. I was like, &#8220;Really? You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me.&#8221;   So we&#8217;d come back from town, and I stopped by that little Crazy Quilt store and there was a nun in there. Her name was Sister Yvonne. You&#8217;ve probably heard of her. Sister Yvonne was there and some of the little local ladies who worked in there. That was major employment for Newcomb. I started. I was just irate and I was talking about it and I was like just beating my fist on the counter going, &#8220;Can you believe? Can you believe? Can you believe?&#8221; And then I just went off on everything, everything I was frustrated about: people not caring enough about people and what happened to them, the school system, coal mining industry. It all just kind of exploded that day. And Sister Yvonne stood there, and she listened to everything I had to say and I just ranted and raved and carried on, and I said, &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s got to do something.&#8221; And she said, &#8220;And you&#8217;re just the one to do it.&#8221;   That was kind of my kickoff into maybe I can do something. That was kind of the point at which everything just kind of flipped for me from just accepting whatever happened to me to want[ing] to be in charge of that. It&#8217;s weird. I was twenty-two. It probably happens for teenagers usually, but it took me that long to sort that out and it all just happened because I just got so angry about all the injustice. Why does it take forty-five minutes? And why is it okay for them to destroy the mountains and people&#8217;s houses and their generations of a way of living? Why is it okay to fundraise for toilet paper at school? Why are those things okay? And why is it okay for my kids not to have textbooks and theirs do? So it all just kind of--. That was like that pivotal moment when it was just like (makes sound). I can&#8217;t not do something.   And the next thing I knew, Marian Collette, apparently, Sister Yvonne had talked to Marian and told her what a little hothead I was, and I got an invitation when I went back into the rag store, which I was in like once a week. Sister Yvonne told me that there was this group in Jellico. It was called Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange and that they were going to have a meeting on this strip mining stuff and that she&#8217;d like for me to come and go with her. And when I got there, she had already, her and Marian had already had a conversation because Marian was all ready, you could tell. She was waiting for me to get there. Marian was awesome. I&#8217;m telling you, she was right, just spot on. Her analysis was just spot on.   JW: What do you remember about that first meeting?   BG: There wasn&#8217;t very many people. I was nervous about being there. That meeting led to another meeting over in Jacksboro at the courthouse, which did not have a happy ending for my family. I just knew that I needed to be engaged somehow, and there wasn&#8217;t enough people. Not enough people cared about it. But the people who were there were very passionate. I remember that. They were passionate about it, and I became very passionate about it. I got involved in that and they had that meeting over there and I went over to Jacksboro at the courthouse for the meeting that they had. And some lobbyist, I didn&#8217;t know at the time he was a lobbyist, but we were asking him about property taxes because they weren&#8217;t paying any. A quarter an acre, really? And so that&#8217;s what this meeting was about: why do you pay that much taxes and why is it okay for you to drill underneath somebody&#8217;s house and destroy everything?   And this lobbyist was there and I was very, very vocal, which was no problem for me. Mama gave that gift to me.   When I walked out, that guy said, &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; And I just spouted off my name. And he said, &#8220;And who&#8217;s your husband?&#8221; And I spouted off his name. I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to misunderstand.&#8221; See, I was so young and naive. I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to [mis]understand, get this misconstrued. It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m against coal. I&#8217;m against the way you all are doing it here. My husband works in coal.&#8221; And he said, &#8220;Maybe you better think about whether your husband has a job after today or not.&#8221; Two weeks later, my husband did not have a job and has never had a public job since. That was all he knew. He went to work in the timber woods at twelve and by the time he was fourteen, he was working in the coal mines and that&#8217;s all he knew. He never had another public job. So it did cost him his job.   JW: How did that affect your relationship?  BG: He told me I should learn to keep my mouth shut, and I didn&#8217;t understand how things worked. I informed him that that just wasn&#8217;t in my nature and that that just made me more determined. And he said, &#8220;Well, okay, if that&#8217;s how you feel about it. Okay.&#8221; So he just kind of accepted that and he would go out and find a little tract of timber somewhere. He timbered with horses. So somebody was always willing to let him come on their land because he wasn&#8217;t real destructive. But that kind of changed everything. Then I was going to have to have a job because somebody had to work and nobody was going to hire him. It was kind of ironic because Marian had been working on a grant with the National Science Foundation and had gotten some money to hire somebody to do some water testing through ASPI. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re heard of them yet or not, Appalachian Service.  JW: Maybe Marian did mention it.  BG: Okay, ASPI. It was this radical Jesuit priest who was in charge of that, who had founded it. He was a hoot. He was a hoot. But anyway, Father Al Fritsch was his name from Rock Castle and he came down, and he loaded me up with all these test supplies. I started hitting the creeks and the ponds and offering to test people&#8217;s wells and stuff like that. I had this little field testing kit, stuff I&#8217;m not really good at, but anyway, I pulled it off. We found out that the water was bad. They were polluting the water, and they just picked up and moved off and just left their mess there because they could. I remember that. A guy owned it by the name of Joe Don Cox over in Campbell County. I remember that. That&#8217;s how I kind of got my feet wet. Then I started talking about all this other, what about all this other stuff? What about the school systems? They&#8217;re horrible. Just all this stuff, mainly school because my kids were in school, and I was really concerned about whether or not they were being educated.  JW: What school were they going to?  BG: Campbell County. It was Jellico. First, they went to Newcomb schools. There was a school in Newcomb, a little elementary school, but not long. They went into Jellico Elementary School and then Jellico High School. When they were in high school, the principal of the high school told me, I mean right out of his own mouth-which blew me away because I was telling him I was really concerned about my kids academically-and he told me that seventy percent of the kids that graduated were functionally illiterate. And he was okay with that, not okay, but he was resigned to that. He was a good man, but he was just resigned. I was like, &#8220;That&#8217;s not okay. It&#8217;s not okay. What does that mean?&#8221;   I organized this little subgroup, a project at Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, because once I got there, Marian just kind of turned me loose and said, &#8220;Okay, what do you think? What do you think? What&#8217;s going on? What do we need to be doing?&#8221; Which was right up my alley because I had a lot on my plate, my agenda, and so I organized a little project that was called Citizens for Better Schools, CBS. And we had this video camera, but it was the old kind. You know the big, heavy kind that you carry around? You know what I&#8217;m saying? And that&#8217;s what the news people use and stuff. Well, I went to the store, and I got some mailbox letters and I put CBS on it. I would go over to the school board meetings and I would dress up to the nines and put on high heels and all this stuff. And I would go over to the school board meetings, and I would set this camera up and they&#8217;d say, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re from CBS.&#8221; And I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Yeah.&#8221; And I&#8217;d record their meetings and stuff.  And I did that for a little while and then I was like, &#8220;This is not where the real decisions are happening. I&#8217;ve got to find out where the real decisions are happening.&#8221; So I busted them. It was a restaurant. It wasn&#8217;t Shoney&#8217;s. It was another restaurant over there. But anyway, I busted them in there. So I carried this equipment in there, and I was videoing them out in the meeting, making the decisions, doing all this stuff.  JW: How did you figure out that they were out?  BG: You could tell. It was rehearsed. It was too rehearsed. At first, I thought it was because I had that big camera and they were being careful, but then all the decisions were the same decisions. So they weren&#8217;t really being careful about the decisions. They were careful about how they presented the positions. Before, they were just very blatant. I met our school board rep. His name was Buzz Baker, and he was corrupted. I mean, he was just corrupted. It was something like you watch on TV that&#8217;s not really real. Kind of reminded me of what my mom said about her dad.   But anyway, so we become arch enemies, me and Buzz Baker because then I began to-something happened. I was taking on textbooks and I was taking on academics and things like that, and then there was a huge documentary that I had an opportunity to see on asbestos. And it was really looking at a particular kind of asbestos and how dangerous that really was. And when I looked, Campbell County schools were built, most of them, what they would have deemed their newer ones, in the 50s, which was when that was very popular for sound-proofing. So I just went, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet these schools are eat up with that.&#8221;   So I went in to the schools and I was looking and most of the pipes, they had the pipes, you know, the pipes were going around the walls, and they had this huge plaster-looking stuff on it, which was asbestos and it was cracked and you could see those kids would bump up against it or they would pull them out because pieces would be missing and let go of it and it would fall and all these fibers would come out. And I was like, &#8220;Oh my God. Oh my God. This is dangerous.&#8221; I know they thought I was making far too much out of it, but back then, it was clear to me that that can&#8217;t be good. I talked to the principal about it at the high school in Jellico, and he was like, &#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m a little concerned too, but I can&#8217;t say anything. I&#8217;ll lose my job.&#8221; The position of teacher was a political position at that time. If you were a teacher, you had power, and he was the principal. But kind of behind the scenes, he was saying, &#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re right.&#8221;   And so I went to the school board and talked to them about it, and they just kind of pooh-poohed me. So I went back to the school board. So I left and I come home and I done a lot of homework and I talked to TVA and I talked to EPA, made some inquiries about it. It was clear. It was just right there, just blatantly, that that was amosite asbestos, which did cause horrible lung cancer and we know that now. So anyway, I talked to other parents. I just stopped parents when they were coming out of school and say, &#8220;Do you know we have asbestos in this school?&#8221; So it was like stirring the pot, making people angry about it because that was the only way. They wasn&#8217;t listening to me by myself. So we got like twenty-five parents were involved with this CBS, little CBS project.   Me and one of the other parents went over to the school board office again to speak to the superintendent. His name was Everett Jones. I&#8217;ll never forget him. We were trying. We were kind of doing our song and dance about why he needed to check in on this and why we really needed an asbestos abatement program. And I guess all he was seeing was dollar signs and that it was going to cost, I don&#8217;t know, probably more money than he could think of or definitely than I could. He told me that he had done some research and that it really wasn&#8217;t that bad, which I knew he was lying. I knew he was lying. And he said, &#8220;Frankly, I&#8217;m a little tired of you little mad mother incorporated coming over here.&#8221; He said that to me, which really made me mad. So I slapped the shit out of him. I did. It was awful. It was awful. I just popped him before I knew what was going on. I mean, how dare you say something like that?  JW: That&#8217;s awful what he said.  BG: How dare you say that?   JW: What did he do?  BG: And I was kind of young in my journey and I was just thinking, &#8220;No way, no way.&#8221; So I slapped him. I mean, I really slapped him hard, hard as I could. And he called the police, and the police came out there. His face was red. At the time, I was a little woman. So the cops were laughing. I mean, they were kind of making fun of him being this big, strong man that needed to call the cops on this little bitty woman because she slapped him. But they told me they was going to put me in jail if I ever did that again, so I didn&#8217;t. I never did that again. But from that point on, I would write articles for the paper and did this protest march that I was talking about, and I had sneaked into the school and stolen samples and sent them off to EPA so I could back up what I was saying. And there was a legal [aid]. The guy&#8217;s name was Neil McBride. Do you know him?  JW: We have an interview with him, too. Yeah, we interviewed him.   BG: Okay, his name was Neil McBride. He was working for some sort of a legal firm. He was a lawyer, and I had enlisted his help and so he was kind of giving me legal advice. He&#8217;s the one that said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t go back and slap him anymore.&#8221; But he was kind of helping, kind of behind the scenes. But anyway, we really appreciated him. He told me who at EPA I needed to talk to and how to get the samples tested for free and all of this stuff.   Then when all of that came back, then we, the school board member I was telling you about, Buzz Baker, who was taking an increasing dislike to me, he arranged, well, two things. There was a school board meeting the night before the protest march, the first and last protest march Jellico&#8217;s ever seen. That was wild. I had this old blue pickup truck, and I had to cross over the mountains. Well, I had to cross over the mountains to get to the other side of the mountain where the school board meeting was, and they followed me back that night. And this guy tried to run me off the road and he just quit. I don&#8217;t know why. He tried to run me off the road two or three, cut me off, and run me off the road, and I just kept driving faster. But anyway, just all of a sudden, he disappeared. He was gone. I don&#8217;t know why. And then the next morning when we got up, somebody had sugared my gas tank. So I had to get another vehicle to carry everybody down to the protest march because I was carrying a bunch of people in the back of the truck.   JW: And did you have any idea about who was doing those things?  BG: Somebody they got to do it. It was somebody they had got to do it and this was after, in the time of all this, in the time of all this, they had offered me a job, a teaching position at the school. You know how much college I had? None. But they were going to give me a teaching position at the school.  JW: To get you to-  BG: To get me to shut up. So first, they tried to fight me. Then they tried to buy me. And then in the end, they tried to take it out on the kids. See, my kids were going to school the whole time all this was going on and some teachers would just treat them like crap and other teachers would just give them straight A&#8217;s. It just depended on their perception of what I was capable of.   JW: You would think that teachers would also be concerned that there was asbestos in their school.  BG: Well, there were some, there were some who were silent, but they couldn&#8217;t come out. They couldn&#8217;t publicly display that. In the end, EPA came to the school board meeting, and they were ordered to do an asbestos abatement program and when they did that-is that your cell phone fixing to go off?  (break in conversation)
BG: So anyway, when they came in to do that-and one of the things I would do is I would just comb, comb the communities and Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange really afforded me a base of operations and I was still on staff there. I was their community organizer. I would just spread leaflets. I would go to parking lots and put them on people&#8217;s cars and do all this stuff with all this information about asbestos. So I was getting kind of a, there was a swelling of people going, &#8220;Wait a minute. Wait a minute.&#8221; Because at one time, it&#8217;s probably in the papers, but at one time, they had gotten a renowned doctor. I mean, he&#8217;d done a lot of good things. His name was Dr. Walker, and he was like the founder of a lot of clinics and all this stuff. But they had convinced him to say that that wasn&#8217;t that bad and it came out in the paper. So that was a doctor contradicting what I was saying, and he&#8217;s a doctor. I smoked and so they would say, &#8220;Well, how&#8217;s that any different than you smoking?&#8221; And I would say, &#8220;Because I choose to. It&#8217;s a law. They have to be there. It&#8217;s not their choice.&#8221; But anyway, it&#8217;s about choices, buddy.   So anyway, they did that and when they came into those schools and tested them, there were several schools in Campbell County and they put a bubble on the school and they wore these, it looked like spacesuits, and went in there and took all of that out. That&#8217;s how drastic it was.
JW: I bet it felt good when the EPA-
BG: It was some personal satisfaction, I&#8217;ve got to say, I&#8217;ve got to say; yeah, there was.  After that, the school board superintendent would call Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange every once in awhile and he&#8217;d say, &#8220;Barbara, I haven&#8217;t seen anything in the paper lately. What are you up to?&#8221; Because he was afraid of what I was going to do next. It was funny. It was funny. And then I got the big notion, okay, so if that guy is that crooked, I&#8217;ll just run for school board myself. So I did. I didn&#8217;t win, of course. I couldn&#8217;t buy votes. I wouldn&#8217;t buy votes. But boy, I made them nervous. The night they were counting the votes, it was me, a Greene which was the wrong name, and a female running against a male whose family had been well-established, had a good reputation, and he was the loan officer at the only bank in Jellico. That&#8217;s who I was running against. So I knew I wasn&#8217;t going to win, but I was determined that I was going to stir things up. They was going to see, they was going to know I&#8217;d been there. So we made homemade signs, stuck them up in trees, and did all this stuff. It was so funny.
JW: So what was the response like in your community? Had people seen a young woman-
BG: No.
JW: Doing this sort of stuff before?
BG: No, no, no. I was a foreign object. No, they hadn&#8217;t. They liked me. I was in because I married in, and so I was in. I was one of the insiders. I was accepted, which was really good. But then they had never seen a young woman doing anything like that. There were no female school board members. There just weren&#8217;t any. So I was like the first one that had ever run, and I made a lot of noise on the way because, well, most of them were not as outspoken as I was. Most of them were more, I don&#8217;t want to use the word submissive, but they were more humble about accepting their lot in life. You know what I&#8217;m saying? It was like a lot in life: &#8220;Okay, well, this is just my lot in life.&#8221; They were more, most of them, most of them were. And then some of them that I talked to were like teachers&#8217; wives and things like that, and they were just like, &#8220;You&#8217;re crazy.&#8221; And then there were other parents, men and women both, who were going, &#8220;Yeah, what about that?&#8221; So it was kind of a mix. When I was knocking on people&#8217;s doors and talking to them and handing out my little homemade flier, I got the sense that people were kind of tired of the way it was, but I don&#8217;t think they felt like they really had the power to do anything about it. But it was fun. It was a hoot.   This is the protest march Tiffany was talking about. They were carrying the signs down the road. We walked from the police station all the way down Main Street, around the loop, and to the high school and then I handed a petition, which I had like three hundred signatures on, to the school principal because the superintendent wouldn&#8217;t come.  JW: So how long did you continue to work with Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange?  BG: Eight years. I was with the Exchange for eight years. Marian eventually left. When you talked to her, she probably talked about leaving Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange and went onto create Whitley County Communities for Children over here in Williamsburg in Whitley County. And I took her place as director of Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange. I had a knack for writing, and so I kind of inherited the grant writing, which was kind of interesting. But in the mix of all that, while all these things were going on, I was getting some opportunities, Jessie, that were just monumental opportunities for my leadership. Through Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, I got connected with CORA and it was before Gaye [Evans] started for CORA. It was another woman there by the name of Vickie Creed. You know Vickie?  JW: I interviewed Vickie last summer.  BG: Okay, it was Vickie, and I had met Vickie and they had some sort of program that they were doing and it was based out of the Highlander Center. But Vickie and Linda Martin were staffing it and they were like the trainers.  JW: Was it the Southern Appalachian Leadership Training Program, SALT?  BG: SALT, it was the SALT fellow, that&#8217;s what it was, which was real strange for me. But anyway, so I went to that program and that&#8217;s where I met Vickie and Linda and then I got connected to CORA, got active in CORA by virtue of getting connected with them. But I went through that SALT training and it was while I was doing this asbestos thing and so things were coming in handy. They had very innovative trainings, which is much like I train now and they were very experiential and active and hands-on and analytical. I would talk about what I was going to do, my strategy. They used to laugh all the time because they knew I hit the superintendent. So they used to laugh all the time and say, &#8220;Okay, so what are we going to do without being physical, Barb?&#8221;  That&#8217;s how I got connected to them and then I got connected to CORA.   And while I was at Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange, I think it was then, probably, I got my GED in 1980 through Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange. We started that college co-op, RCEC, about that time and that where I got three years of college that way in six years. I was working, raising those kids, and trying to take classes, which was a challenge.   But anyway, that&#8217;s when I kind of looked outside into some of the other communities and made some connections about some of the community organizing that was happening in different places, and it was always the women. No, no, there were men, there were men, but in terms of what I perceive to be empowerment work, it was the women. They were kind of the gatekeepers of empowerment. Men thought about it differently, and there weren&#8217;t any models out there. So we [were] using terms like circle model. You&#8217;ve probably heard that before, too. So we&#8217;d start talking about terms like that and what that would look like if it were for real and how we needed to form partnerships and trying to move from just total bumping into really, what would it look like if we were able to collaborate with some of these institutions that we had traditionally not been able to? What if we could find somebody inside who wanted to collaborate? What if we could do--? So it was all that kind of stuff going on.   I had an opportunity to go to Mexico. I went to Mexico back in late &#8217;70s, early &#8217;80s. I went to Mexico, and I got a chance to meet some of the women who are doing community organizing in Mexico. And one of them was around the big earthquake in Mexico City, and I met some of the women who had been very active and had actually kidnapped some of the owners who were just wanting everything, wanting their machines before they found people. So I got a chance to kind of meet them and talk to them and hear their story and kind of learn from some of their strategies. I met the underground newspaper over there of women who were working in El Salvador who were just trying to identify the dead. The women of the garment union, I got a chance to see a lot of their history through murals and things like that. It was just like light bulbs everywhere. It was just like, &#8220;Oh, oh, oh.&#8221; It was a life-changing experience for me to step outside of my own.   I got to go to Mexico twice, which was pretty cool, and then I got to go to Nicaragua in the early &#8217;80s too, I think, early, mid-. I can&#8217;t remember now. But I got to go then. So I got to meet all these people in Nicaragua who was doing community work, see the different way that they define the community and organize community and the programs, it was pretty cool, and started to understand the kind of kinship between Appalachia and the Third World countries. And again, primarily it was women who were the movers and the shakers and really looking after the big picture. And so that was kind of cool. I liked that a lot. That was also life-changing because I got to stay in a home in one of the villages with a family whose family had been very active in the Sandinista War, and I didn&#8217;t speak their language and they didn&#8217;t speak mine. So we had to try to figure out how to manage to talk to each other, which we used pictures and things like that. And then I would have an interpreter come in and kind of interpret the pictures and some of the things that I drew. We got to go to the prison, which was life-changing, too.   I think there was a part of me that after I went to Nicaragua, I was still angry, I was still angry, but there was a deeper, I don&#8217;t know, there was something happened. I just kind of had a deeper understanding of the whys and the why nots, that things are the way they are. It was a spiritual experience for me, except for that one idiot we took with us who I wanted to kick to the curb every other day. I was like hanging in there during the debriefing because they were all like just done with him and I was like, &#8220;Okay, I know he&#8217;s an idiot, but he&#8217;s with us. We&#8217;ve got to figure out how we&#8217;re going to engage with this guy. It&#8217;s important he learns something.&#8221; That was funny.  JW: So how were you changing as you got more involved in all this stuff?  BG: Well, for one thing, my methods changed, I mean, not just from hitting or not hitting, lashing out, but strategy and different strategies that I could use that would be helpful. Not always a protest march, not always banging doors and butting heads, but other strategies. More how to appeal and help people understand the benefit for them in the needed change. So I&#8217;ve become more articulate, become more articulate, and I had a richer sense of justice and it was beyond me and mine or my community. It was becom[ing] more global. I changed that way.   And I very intentionally sought out opportunities to develop my skills. When I went to college, when I took those college courses, it wasn&#8217;t toward a degree. It was different courses that I was eligible to take that might be a tool for what I wanted to do. So it was a different way of looking at college. Everybody thought I was crazy for doing it that way, but I really was going for tools. I wanted to take sociology. I wanted to understand, okay, so what makes this group of people act this way and have those values? Where did those come from? So understanding all of that. I took psychology too, but the sociology, I was just fascinated with that part.   JW: What had you imagined you would be when you were little?  BG: Oh my God. I don&#8217;t know.   JW: I mean, did it ever seem like these sorts of things-  BG: No.  JW: Would be available to you?  BG: No, no, no. I never imagined myself having a great deal of friends and social life and things like that. I never imagined that and almost all of my social life has been around social justice. My friendships that I developed have been in basically the social justice arena. I suspect we have a lot in common. I got involved with CORA and their ADPC program and then the next thing I knew, I was like chairing that program and so I was kind of forced to take on a new leadership thing and to learn how to convene meetings, I mean like bigger meanings with a more diverse group of people. Things like that.   I would never have imagined myself doing any of that stuff, never, never, never. And just right up until the time I did that, I would not have imagined me doing that. It&#8217;s just been kind of interesting. I really haven&#8217;t chose a lot of things. Things kind of choose me and when it happens, I&#8217;m just like, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have to get involved in that,&#8221; but it&#8217;s not something I necessarily seek out. It just comes to me. But if I don&#8217;t do what I need to do, then I pay the price for that. I feel like every time I&#8217;ve argued with God about what I was supposed to be doing, in the end, I did what he wanted me to anyway. I needed to learn to recognize that a little better and get on the page.   I left the Exchange, though, in the &#8217;80s and went to Virginia to start a women&#8217;s organization down there and that was through CORA. I got connected up with Terry [?]. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve heard about Terry. I got connected to Terry (82:21) in Virginia and she was working at this little place called Dungannon Development Commission. Ann Leibig, have you met?  JW: Yeah.  BG: Okay, so Ann was kind of the--. I mean, if you look, there was a little nun activist stuck here and there in Appalachia who was kind of stirring people and identifying leaders and kind of fostering that to happen and bringing in resources for it to happen. So I left. I left and I moved to Virginia and started an organization with Terry. We kind of co-founded it. It was called Appalachian Women Empowered, AWE, which was still pretty sassy to be saying stuff like that. But anyway, it was kind of cool and we done a lot of cool stuff and we got very engaged with the In Praise of Mountain Women stuff, helped found that and just women&#8217;s issues, specifically women&#8217;s issues. But you can&#8217;t talk about women&#8217;s issues without including their families. You can&#8217;t just separate that out because their issues are their family.  JW: So can you describe why you think it was so important for these women&#8217;s organizations to exist in the first place?  BG: For one thing, they had no voice. Women did not have a voice. It reminds me of Dallas and Linda. I don&#8217;t know if you remember that or not, but there was this one character. Her name was Linda and she was supposed to be the alcoholic wife of J. R. Ewing, the big-shot tycoon on there. And when it first started, they gave her absolutely no lines. You know what I&#8217;m saying?  JW: Yeah, I know the show.  BG: So there was very, very minimal from her at first. In the later part of that movie&#8217;s journey, she was a big focal point of it. But I remember, she started with no voice and she would do these very subtle things. I kind of watched her, like the expressions she would use or the body language she would use, or all these that would call the focus. And people were like, &#8220;We want to hear more from Linda. We want to know more about Linda."   And I was saying that was how it was for Appalachian women. They just, they didn&#8217;t really have a voice. So they were just trying to figure out what expression they needed to have or how strong a body language they would need. So it was kind of like, that probably makes no sense, but just kind of fumbling with what can I say? Where can I say? What can I wear? What can I--? You know what I&#8217;m saying? Because the whole community, not the whole community, but there were factions of the community when I lived over there that thought I was, one, a witch, had to be, I had to be a witch, two, a communist, and three, probably a lesbian, because those were the only kind of people who would have the kind of notions I had and would act on it. You had to be a lesbian, a communist, or a witch, or maybe a combination of. It was so funny.  JW: That would be a really interesting combination, wouldn&#8217;t it?  BG: Yeah. (laughs) I was just thinking, &#8220;Oh thank you. You give me so much power. So you think I can do this and this and I can do that and I have--. Whoa. And you&#8217;re all talking about me? Woohoo.&#8221;   JW: So did you see yourself as part of the women&#8217;s movement?  BG: No, not at first, no. I saw me as part of a community movement, but as I kind of grew in my journey of activism, then I began to see myself--. I had difficulty with the word &#8220;feminism&#8221; for a long time because I didn&#8217;t really relate to what that looked like or what I thought that looked like because that were people who had read all these books and knew all these authors and they were all white women and they were all New York and seemed to be upper class. So I really didn&#8217;t see any kinship with them. But, kind of in my own journey, I began to think about myself more as maybe a grassroots feminist, which was somehow different from that. I mean, part of that was true, but glass ceilings, really? What the hell does that mean? What do you mean that you have glass ceilings? I don&#8217;t get that and what does that have to do with this author, with this book? It didn&#8217;t have any relationship to my life, to my existence, and my journey. And so I think a lot of us kind of claimed the grassroots feminism perspective.  JW: Can you describe grassroots feminism or define it or what you mean by it?  BG: Yeah. I think grassroots women are more about place. I think they&#8217;re more about the land. They&#8217;re more about family. I mean, not that they don&#8217;t care anything about that, but that kind of justice, a real sense of justice, but it&#8217;s not a justice necessarily about wages. It&#8217;s not just economic justice. It&#8217;s an emotional justice. Gosh. It&#8217;s a way to be, a way to interact, a sense of fairness beyond me and mine, racial justice and all of that, classism and all of that. Grassroots feminism encompasses all of those things, which was seen and felt much different than what I thought I saw on a national level of these women in New York around all this economic--. Economics is only this much of injustice to women. Oppression of women, period, which on the grassroots level was-.  JW: When you say economic justice, you mean-  BG: Even in New York, even in New York, the oppression of women was different than what I saw feminism being demonstrated as. Do you see what I&#8217;m saying? It wasn&#8217;t oppression of women, period. It was oppression of women economically.  JW: And when you say economically, do you mean-  BG: Higher end.  JW: Right, the professional women wanting to become doctors and lawyers.  BG: Well, yes, it was professional women, not community women.  JW: Right, women in the textile mills or-  BG: Not those women, not those women. Those women were never discussed in that movement until much later in the game. They were never. It wasn&#8217;t about that. Environmental oppression of women, I mean, all of these things because it&#8217;s just so much bigger than that. It was narrow, and it was focused on upper-class white women professionals, and I saw grassroots and more people in the communities who are being, it&#8217;s a different level of oppression and it&#8217;s not just economic. It&#8217;s everything.  JW: Do you remember when you started to articulate that difference between those more upper-class feminists and grassroots feminism? And I love that way of putting it, that phrase &#8220;grassroots feminism.&#8221;  BG: I think part of it, that came around the time of after Nicaragua and while we were putting together In Praise of Mountain Women, and that was in conversations. It was kind of a unified &#8220;aha&#8221; that a lot of us had come to about, &#8220;Wait a minute. Wait a minute.&#8221; I mean, we would sit for hours and have these conversations about why is it this way? You would have one piece and I would have one piece and she would have another piece and she would have another piece, and we would just build one all that. We would go, &#8220;Wow, and maybe I am a feminist because you know what? Really, let&#8217;s define what feminism is for us, what it means to us, what that would mean here.&#8221;  Grassroots feminism kind of got born out of those kinds of conversations because it was true for the non-profits, too. The men still had the higher-paying jobs. You know what I&#8217;m saying? Because it&#8217;s modeled after the system. Even though it strives to be very different and really embodies empowerment of people, if it&#8217;s set up just like the system, you&#8217;re kind of limited. And we talked about things that like non-profits need to be more careful so that they&#8217;re empowering internally as they are externally, and they really needed to look at things like are we a mini-system or do we really operate differently? Walking the walk in terms of what we believe and circle model and a holistic approach to healing, and things like that. And we were all women who were healing. That was part of it. We were all on a healing journey, too. Almost everybody I knew was trying to heal from something. In Praise of Mountain Women was about women healing. That first gathering was just to celebrate survival of women in the mountains and to engage in a healing journey. That&#8217;s pretty cool. And now ironically, years later, the In Praise of Mountain Women is housed at the Cope house where I work.  JW: I didn&#8217;t know that.  BG: Yeah. So it&#8217;s kind of come full circle or I&#8217;ve kind of come full circle with that. The core team is now located here in Williamsburg. So we&#8217;re still, we&#8217;re trying to carry on. It&#8217;s kind of been handed partly because a lot of women who were in the journey are older and energy is not the same. They&#8217;re tired or worn down and stuff. And I had kind of been out of the loop a little bit because some of the things that I had gotten engaged in. I had moved back from Virginia to Tennessee again to take care of Mom, and then I moved to Kentucky because I didn&#8217;t want to live in Campbell County. I didn&#8217;t want my grandkids-I was raising Justin-I didn&#8217;t want him in Jellico School anymore. I didn&#8217;t want to fight that fight anymore and because I needed mental health services for him and the state of Kentucky was one of the most progressive states of all in mental health. So I moved to Kentucky so he could get what he needed or I thought. Apparently, there was a plan. I didn&#8217;t know it at the time.   JW: Well, is there anything else that you want to add or any questions I didn&#8217;t ask that you thought I would?  BG: Oh gosh. I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;m sixty now. I started when I was twenty-two. So it&#8217;s been almost forty years maybe and all of those things, all of those analyses and all of that social justice journey, which, in Virginia, I was laying in front of coal tracks--. Anyway, but all of that, I still use all of that. I feel like I&#8217;m still on that journey. I use a different strategy and we&#8217;re trying to change Medicaid regulations now so that they will accept and pay for peer support and more supports in the community instead of kids going out of state or out of community to be hospitalized and all of that stuff, and working with parents to really do leadership, become leaders in their community, the non-traditional. I hate that word they use, &#8220;disenfranchised,&#8221; but that same group of parents, of people, to develop their leadership skills and kind of get on their own leadership journey and creating awareness. So I&#8217;m still trying to do all that in the realm I&#8217;m in. We&#8217;ve created a leadership academy. So I still do a lot of, I do constant trainings and writing curriculums and stuff like that around leadership development.   So that&#8217;s still very much there and probably will be until I pass the torch, which, at the rate I&#8217;m going, will be at my death. I can&#8217;t afford to retire because I haven&#8217;t worked very many straight jobs in my life. They&#8217;ve all been non-profits and sometimes you get paid and sometimes you don&#8217;t. You never have health insurance and all that. So I haven&#8217;t accumulated a lot of stuff to retire with. So I&#8217;ll be there awhile. But all of that is still very there. I still use the same things. I&#8217;m still operating off that same analysis and still trying to gather people together to keep thinking about that and still, I think, probably growing in my grassroots feminist journey. So it&#8217;s a life journey and it&#8217;s not about any particular issue, I think, really. I think issues is what causes us, but it&#8217;s been more of a life journey about purpose and who I am and how I want to be and the mark I&#8217;m going to leave and that sort of thing, at least now.   I always wished, and me and Gaye[Evans] used to talk about this a lot, we had some place where all of us older grassroots feminists could go to and live, and we&#8217;d sit on the porch in rocking chairs and be wise old crones. We&#8217;d have all these young grassroots feminists who would come and we would work with them, something like that. So I&#8217;m still waiting for that. I&#8217;m still kind of waiting for that.  JW: We could use it. Those of us who are younger could use that place to go to.  BG: Yeah, wouldn&#8217;t that be awesome to have a place you could go and you&#8217;ve got all these wise old crones who have kind of been through the mill and all of that? Today when we talk about heroes and sheroes, I still cite Mother Jones as one of my sheroes and Marian as like my mentor, and Gaye. I&#8217;ve learned a lot about creative expressions and the need for people to creatively express what they think and how they feel and to have a voice, particularly women, to have a voice. So I&#8217;m still on my journey, which is pretty cool. I like it a lot.   JW: Well, thanks so much for doing this, Barb.  BG: Oh you&#8217;re so welcome.  JW: This has been great.  BG: I appreciate having an opportunity to talk about it.  JW: Yeah, well, you have a wonderful story.   BG: Thank you.  JW: I&#8217;m glad we can share it.
