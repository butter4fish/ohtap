 Wilson  Tyrrell  Today is July 16, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I   m with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at the Oklahoma State  University Library. I am at the Oklahoma City Museum of Art. Joining  me today is Betty Tyrrell, who I will be talking with about her memories  of the 1930s.  Her niece Maggie Darcey is also with us.  Thank you for  joining me today.  You   re more than welcome.  Would you mind telling me when and where you were born?  I was born at Saint Anthony   s Hospital, February 3, 1924. In a  snowstorm.  In a snowstorm. (Laughter) What were your parents    names?  Elizabeth O   Neil-Darcey and Henry Joseph Darcey.  What were their professions?  My mother didn   t work. My father was an engineer.  In Oklahoma City?  Yes. He had his own business then, at that time. He and his best friend  had come from Washington together and put in the highway to Clayton,  New Mexico, from here to Clayton.  Wow.  You didn   t know that?  5  Darcey  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  No.  Is that what brought them to Oklahoma, to work on the highway?  Yes, they both graduated from Catholic U and came down here. They  just liked   my father liked it, but a man absconded with their money  that they took in, and Uncle Cam thought Oklahoma was full of thieves,  so he went back. (Laughter) He didn   t stay, but my father did. They  married sisters, and they were very close friends. Almost like brothers.  Where was your mother from? Was she from     Originally, she was born in Kansas. She was raised here on Thirteenth  and Hudson.  Do you know how they met?  Well, she said she looked down from the choir loft at Saint Joe and  would see Daddy in church all the time on Sundays. And she said she  was walking down Main Street one day, and someone called her name,  said,    Elizabeth,    and she turned around and saw Daddy. And she  thought,    Well  That wasn   t nice,    but it happened to be a friend that she  knew who introduced them, and they were married a year later. And  then she introduced Uncle Cam to one of (she had five sisters) her  sisters, and he didn   t like her. So, when Aunt Happy came from  Kansas   she was visiting up there. She came home and he met her, and  they got married two months after Mother and Daddy.  Two weeks after Gram got married?  Happy, Aunt   or Harriet. We call her Happy. And her daughter   s called  Happy, too.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  Oh, yes. I have one sister and two brothers.  Were they older or younger?  No, I   m the oldest.  So, what was your family   s home like where you grew up?  It was very nice. I loved it. We got along. There were four of us, so we  got along. We were only six years difference in our ages, so we were  fairly close, and we didn   t have any problems that I know of, except the  6  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  dust storm. I remember Mother would say,    Go out and look at the  cracks in the earth and you can see China.    (Laughter)  When do you remember the dust starting?  Oh, I don   t remember. All I remember about it is every night in the  summer months, when it was so horrible, she put wet sheets in front of  all the windows, and then in the morning would wash them because  they   d be red from the dust and everything. But it kept the sand from  coming in the house because we didn   t have air conditioning. So, it was  totally different than it is now.  Were most of the streets in Oklahoma City paved?  Oh, yes.  But would they get covered with dust? Would dust build up?  Oh, yes, everything. It was   you have no idea, I don   t think.  No. (Laughs)  It was like if you didn   t dust your house for a year, maybe, you   d have  that must dust on. So, to keep a house clean during that time was   I  don   t know how they did it. I really don   t.  Was everything covered   the city, everything in the city?  Oh, everything. You could see it roll in. The sky would get dark, and it  would come in. And we had a maid, Verna, who was Indian, and she just  thought this was part of life. Just like she told us,    Don   t ever worry  about a tornado, it   ll never hit the city.    It never has hit in the area where  we lived.  So, you just had one domestic help at that time?  Yes. When she left   she married the bus driver, the Crescent bus driver,  and moved to Florida. (Laughter) And then we got Dorothy, and  Dorothy stayed until after the war.  So, as a child, what were some things you would do to entertain  yourself?  Read a lot, and play with animals and kick the can at night when it was  cooler. And crawling in houses that were being built because the house  that my father built where we were raised was   I guess, it wasn   t the  7  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  last one on that block. There were others that were built later. So, we just  did things like that.  Would you go downtown?  We went downtown, usually. When we got older, we   d go downtown on  the bus and go to Anna Maude   s for lunch. That was a big treat. We  thought,    Oh, that   s wonderful     And     And tell her about going to the cinema on Saturdays, to the Plaza.  Going to the Plaza?  The theater.  Well, first we went to the Victorian. Do you know where that is? It   s on  Classen and Nineteenth, I think, yes, about Nineteenth. It   s now a law  building, but at that time it was a theater, and it had double seats, leather  seats. And you   d go   the kids   the theaters opened at ten o   clock, and  there would be myriads of kids waiting to get in to get those double  seats. It was only two rows of them, but fight to get those. (Laughter)  And you   d take your lunch with you to the movies, and you   d be there  until five in the afternoon because there was   Uncle Leo, from the zoo,  had a show, and then they had a talent show with the kids that were in  the theater. Then you   d have a serial that you would see, a cowboy serial  every week. Then you   d have a movie, two movies, and then you   d go  home and it would be about five o   clock.  Do you remember how much it cost to go?  It cost fifteen cents. It was a dime until you got to be twelve, and then it  was fifteen cents.  And popcorn and     Yes, well, I got a quarter a week as an allowance, so I would   I was real  thrifty. (Laughs) I would go downtown on the bus to Kress   s and buy  candy. It was brown sugar candy. I remember that. And you   d get a  piece about that big for a nickel. (Gestures) Well, I   d break it in half and  eat one, one week, and then the other one the next week. (Laughter) So,  I saved a dime, and that   s what I bought my Christmas presents for the  family with was from that dime that I saved every week.  Did you have to pay for bus fare?  Oh, yes.  8  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Do you remember how much that was?  It was a dime.  Were there streetcars in Oklahoma City?  There was streetcars down in Irvins, down Classen, and they went to  Norman. And they were there until a year or two after the war. You  could go to Guthrie on a streetcar or you could go to Norman on the  streetcar.  Did you ever do that?  Oh, yes. My sister lived at Norman, and I used to go down there after  she had married and her husband came back from war. I   d go down on  the weekends to see her.  Did you have a lot of family living around you when you were growing  up?  We had, as I said, my mother had these sisters, and when Uncle Cam  and Aunt Happy moved back to Washington, Mother kept two of her  children, and another sister kept two until they got settled in New York.  And so, they lived with us for about six months. So, there were six of us,  then, but all of our cousins are very close, and we have been all our  lives. Now, they   re going by the wayside.  Would you get together at family gatherings?  When we were young, only the ones that lived here. And Aunt Helen  lived here. She had three at that point, and Aunt Florence lived here, and  she had four. Mother, of course, had four, Aunt Happy had four, and so  there was all of us. Then Uncle Sam died, and Aunt Florence then  moved to Kansas City, and they started moving after the war. So, that  made a difference.  And is there a park in town named after one of your family members?  Yes, after my grandfather.  What   s the story there?  John O   Neil. Well, he was on the park commission or whatever it is, and  so they named a park after him. I guess he did a good job. (Laughter) He  loved Oklahoma, also, and he was actually from Kentucky, through  9  Darcey  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Kansas, and then here. Good Irishman.  Yes. Can she talk about him for a minute?  Yes.  Who?  Can you talk about Grandpa O   Neil and his character and     Oh, he was a character. He was six-foot-four or five, I don   t know, and  my grandmother was like five-foot-one, little tiny. And their parents on  either side were from Ireland. And his mother, Grandfather O   Neil   s  mother, when the men   all his children were married and gone, would  stay with Mother   s mother. She was rather tall and loved to read, and she  was a doll. She died the year after I was born, so I didn   t know her, but  we   ve got pictures of her.  Grandpa O   Neil was very charismatic.  Yes.  Right. He used to go out and wear     Yes. He   d wear a cape. Oh, yes. (Laughter) He was really something. He  was fancy. He was good-looking, an extremely good-looking man, and if  you ever come across a book called Successful Oklahomans, he   s in that.  There   s a picture of him in that, a full picture.  Why was he successful?  Well, he was in the hardware business and, evidently, did a very good  job with it.  Did he own a hardware store?  He didn   t own it. He worked for Richard and Conover, out of Kansas  City. Then he, believe it or not, retired at fifty-five, which, to me, seems  awfully young, but that   s when he retired. He unfortunately had  pernicious anemia, and he died, oh, I don   t know, in    36, I think it was.  And if he had lived another year, they would have found vitamin B-12,  and he would have lived, but they didn   t know about it then.  How old were you when he died?  Let   s see. I was born in    24. I must have been eleven or twelve.  10  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  So, you knew him?  Yes, he was a real nice. But my mother, every Sunday we went over to  see Grandpa because he was in bed. And he   d gotten so thin, and he kind  of scared us, but Mother, at the door, would have us right stand at the  door and she   d push us in,    Go kiss your grandfather. Go kiss him.     (Laughs) So, the first one was me and then Jean and then Jim and then  Pete, and we   d run out of the room. (Laughter) Oh, crazy.  That was in the    30s.  Yes.  So it was the    30s that they discovered vitamin B and what it does for  our bodies?  Yes, which is amazing. It   s amazing what they have discovered just not  that many years ago, people died of.  I   m thinking you were probably about twelve when Dad tells the story  of   I think he was six when he went downtown or something and,  anyway, he had to catch a taxi. And he helped the taxi driver change a  flat tire?  Yes.  Do you remember the story?  I don   t remember. He tells     And the goats, remember the     Her father was my youngest brother, and when he was about   well,  when you get to be a Boy Scout, and he had to walk so many miles. I  don   t know what he was walking for   to get a badge, I know, but I  meant I don   t know how many miles it was. And he was walking, and he  got so far into the country. And this woman was angry at her husband,  and she gave Pete, my brother, five goats. So, he walked past the Capitol  building. He got to Robinson with these five goats following him, and a  cab driver stopped and said,    Can I help you?    And he got in the cab  with all the goats and came home. Well, my mother was having a bridge  party. She had two tables of bridge.  And white carpet.  11  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  And a lady up the street, the block before, called and said,    Libby        that   s what they called her      You   re going to faint when you see your  son     And she didn   t tell her why. So, Mother said she waited a bit and  went back to play her cards. He came in the front door and opened the  door and walked in with these goats. (Laughter) So, we kept the goats  for about three days and the neighbors complained. Oh, they didn   t want  goats in the backyard. So, finally, my mother   well, the husband of the  woman came and took three of them because they were registered goats.  Now, I don   t know anything about goats, but they were supposedly good  goats. And so, we ended up with two, and so Mother put them in the car,  and we went down to the river. There were shacks on the river, and she  found a little boy walking down the street, and she said,    Would you like  a goat?    And the little boy said,    Oh, yeah     And all of us were in the  car.    Oh, yeah     He   d love a goat. So, Mother just said,    Open the door  and let them out.    (Laughter) So, we did, and I don   t know whatever,  they probably ate them because they were so poor down there.  So, did he get all five goats?  No. The man took three, and there was only two. So, that boy got two.  So, that was the end of our goats. (Laughter)  So, by this river there were shacks?  Oh, yes.  People in shanties and     That was like   oh, gosh, yes. The shacks were there until in the    50s.  Wow. And what   s the name of the river?  Canadian.  This river right here.  The Canadian River. It was on this south side of the Canadian River.  You   d go over the bridge and there was just shacks, is what they were.  Poor people lived there and, of course, the Depression was on, and there  were a lot of poor people.  Were they also scattered throughout the city?  They were in that   no, there was a whole bunch of them, I shouldn   t use  the term    bunch,    but there was a whole group of them over there. I bet  there was three or four hundred of them that lived over there.  12  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wow  Three or four hundred shanties?  Yes. You   d just see them. And when I first went to work at the VA   Veteran   s Administration , the bus would go through that area, and they  were still there. So, that was in the    40s and    50s. So, they lived there a  long time.  Wow.  It was interesting, but things got better. The economy got better, and  they started moving, and people bought that land, and it just all changed.  Kind of like now. Everything   s changing downtown.  Were you aware of any soup kitchens or programs to help people?  Oh, yes. You have to be because it was in the news all the time. And our  papers were not like today   s. They were big, thick papers. Take you a  little bit   an hour to go through them, and you would know what went  on. And, of course, then, on the radio you   d hear the news every day,  what was going on, nationwide.  Did you listen to radio programs, also?  Oh, yes, I did. Goodness gracious, yes.  What are some that you remember?  Well, let   s see. Squeaky door   what was the name of that one? Anyway,  the nuns where I went to boarding school, we had study hall two hours  every evening, and in the middle of Sunday night, Sister would say,     Turn the light of.    She would turn it off, turn the radio on, and we   d  hear this squeaking door. It was a mystery, and we   d sit there and listen  for thirty minutes to the mystery. (Laughs) Oh, gosh. And then, on  Saturday morning they had cowboy kind of type things on the radio for  the kids, and there was always something that you could listen to. There  was a lot of mysteries on the radio.  How old were you when you started to school?  I must have been five.  And what was the name of your school?  Saint Francis. And it was on Villa, at that point. Villa and Twenty-second,  I think, and then they moved to Eighteenth Street. Then I went  13  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  to the Villa. I went from St. Francis, I guess, to Gatewood and then the  Villa, and then I went to boarding school.  Was the boarding school in Oklahoma City?  It was in Albuquerque.  What was the name of that?  Saint Vincent   s Academy.  How old were you when you went to boarding school?  Thirteen.  So, in the earlier years of school, what do you remember about     I remember at Gatewood that we had a teacher by the name of Mrs.  Locke, who was an Indian princess   truly, was an Indian princess. That  was no joke, and she was so pretty. All the kids thought Mrs. Locke was  just wonderful  (Laughs) And I saw her   years ago, now   but she was  in her eighties, and she still was pretty. She wasn   t stocky like some  Indians get. She was slender and very pretty.  Was she a good teacher?  Oh, yes. She taught good Oklahoma history.  Interesting.  I wonder how Oklahoma history classes have changed over the years.  I would love to know.  What did you learn about? Do you remember?  Well actually, we learned more about Indians. We learned about how the  Indians came here and how some of them were forced here, and then  how they took the land from other Indians and things like that. She went  into great detail with things, which was her history, really, if you stop  and think about it.  I feel like a lot of people did not learn about Indians and Oklahoma in  that time period.  Well, I think today, people don   t seem to know that or care. But to me,  14  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  that   s our history. I think it   s pretty neat.  What would you do at recess?  Well, we   d play and we   oh, and in Gatewood, at recess they let you go  get a doughnut. Oh, and I thought those were the best. They were those  thick ones. I don   t think I   ve eaten   and they were whole wheat  doughnuts. You don   t see those anymore. And we   d all get to go down  and get a doughnut. (Laughs)  Do you remember how much the doughnut cost?  Probably a nickel.  Was there a doughnut shop by the school?  No, it was in the cafeteria. No, they wanted you to have something, I  think, mid-morning. So, you wouldn   t work hard.  Did you play marbles at recess?  I didn   t, no. They did. The boys did.  And would you eat lunch in the cafeteria at school?  Oh, yes.  How would you get to school?  Walked. It was only seven blocks, so it wasn   t any big deal. You walked  it, everybody walked so far. Pennsylvania divided it. The west side went  to Hawthorne, and the east side, which we were on, went to Gatewood.  So, we were the beginning, and you   d start walking, and you   d pick up  somebody else because they   d be going, and by the time you got there,  there might be seven or eight kids together going to school.  Was that when you lived on Nineteenth?  Eighteenth.  Eighteenth?  Yes, yes.  What would you do after school?  15  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Go home and take your clothes off and put on play clothes and play  outside with the animals, because we always had dogs. Dogs and rabbits  and anything Daddy would bring home.  Did you have any chores growing up?  Not a lot. We had to wash dishes. I don   t remember much else. Momma  made even the boys wash dishes because she said Dorothy fixed the  dinner, and we ought to be thankful and wash our dishes.  Did your family raise a garden or did they get all their groceries  downtown?  We had fruit trees, but that   s all.  Where would you get your groceries?  From Kamp   s. They delivered. You   d just call in the morning, and  they   d bring whatever you wanted.  And did they deliver milk and cream also, or was there someone else?  No, we had another dairy that did that every day. And they had a   not a  truck, but they had like a wagon, only it looked more like a truck today,  and had ice chests in it and it was horse drawn. They would go down,  you   d clip-clop down the street, and then they   d   everybody   the  milkman would come in the back door. Everybody had their backdoor  open, so he   d come in the backdoor. And, like during the Depression, I  told you about the poor people. They would come knock on the  backdoor, and my mother always had Dorothy fix a dinner for them, and  they   d sit down on the steps and eat. But nobody thought about anyone  stealing or doing anything like that. The backdoor was always open. You  could come   maybe that   s why I leave mine open. (Laughter) I never  lock mine.  Maybe that   s why I   m always locking your backdoor. (Laughter)  Yes. Mine is always open. I never think about it.  How would you keep things cool?  We had ice. An ice man delivered ice. Our refrigerator   it wasn   t a  refrigerator. It was an ice     Box.  16  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Yes, and it had four doors   three doors, probably. One for the ice, and  then underneath the ice is where the milk was kept, and then on the other  side, vegetables and whatever. But the milkman would just come in and  put it in. And the laundry man would come on Monday and pick up the  laundry, and then he brought it back on Wednesday. And he had a crush  on Verna, too, because we used to tease her about that. (Laughter)  Did she live with you?  Yes.  Did she have separate quarters?  No. She lived upstairs the same as we did. They were just kind of like  another person in the house.  Did they mainly take care of the kids?  Yes. They took care of us if Mother and Daddy were gone because  Daddy taught a lot and was asked to go to different universities. He   d be  gone a week or two weeks, and he always took Momma with him. So,  we had somebody there with us.  That   s why Verna called my dad her own.  Yes, Dorothy did. Dorothy said that Pete was hers. Yes, she didn   t care.  She said it wasn   t Mother   s. It was her baby. (Laughter)  Do you remember going on vacation?  Oh, yes. We went to Washington, D.C., every year.  How would you get there?  Well, we used to go on the train, and then when they got a little older,  my mother would drive us, my father would, Mother and Daddy would.  And then my father   we   d stay usually a month or longer, and then my  father would come, and we   d buy a new car and the boys would go  home with Daddy, and Mother and Jean and I would be in the other car.  And we usually brought a dog or a fish or something back to Oklahoma  with us. (Laughs)  So, they would buy a new car in Washington, D.C., every year?  Yes. And we   d always get   one of us   Mother would get to drive the  new car, and Daddy and the boys got the old car.  17  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Do you remember some of the makes and models of these cars?  No. I wasn   t a car buff, so it didn   t make any difference. Just so we got  home.  What do you remember about Washington, D.C., in that time period?  It was a nice, quiet town, and we lived at 2140 I, which is right down  from the White House, so we could walk up there very easily. It runs  into Pennsylvania Avenue, in a block from where our house was, so you  were right there. And then you could walk to the Lincoln Memorial or  the    And Mother had us walking out everywhere, so we walked a lot.  It was one street off of Pennsylvania?  Well, Pennsylvania Avenue goes like this. (Gestures) I street is right  here, right next to it, but it runs right into it. And the house,  Grandmother owned all those houses, and when they sold them after she  and Grandpa died, Georgetown University bought them and made them  into residence for interns. The last time I was up there, they had torn all  those down, and they were building a big building. So, it   s gone. All that  is gone.  So, you had relatives living in the houses near you when you were there  in the summer?  Well, they didn   t live near us. They lived out further because we were so  in town. And then we had some cousins that lived in Rockville,  Maryland, which is sixteen miles outside of Washington, and we went  out there.  Was it a lot different there than it was in Oklahoma City?  Oh, yes. It was not as hot, and it was   I don   t know. We just had a lot to  do. And our cousins were fun to be with because we hadn   t seen them,  and they   re the ones that lived with us for a while. So, we really got to  see them and play with them. They lived in the house that their father  was born in, out in Rockville, and it was great big old brown house.  They painted it white now, and it doesn   t look the same. And they   ve  sold some of the property. Whoever owns it now, I don   t know.  Is I the street that   s named Darcey now? Or is that a different a different  one?  No, no. It   s I, like the alphabet I, is what it is.  18  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Wilson  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Right, yes.  And I could tell you the phone numbers, even, for that. (Laughter)  Oh, my gosh.  So, is there a street in Washington, D.C. named Darcey?  Yes. That   s her maiden name.  Yes, but    No, I is    I wish you could see it because in the old days,  when we were little, we played in the alley. The houses had manicured  front lawns, and they were very small, about the size of that. (Gestures)  They weren   t very big, and all these houses had iron steps up to the first  floor. The basements were beautiful, and usually three or four rooms in  the basement. And during the Depression, a lot of people rented their  basements, but then the alley was in back, and it was all cobblestone,  and that   s where we played a lot because the houses were built on a  square, a block this way and a block that way. And all the cars were in  the alley, or the garages. They were funny.  What about your family vacations up to Silver Lakes? When did that  begin? Was that in the    30s?  Yes. We came back from Washington one year, and it was still so hot  here, my father decided to take us to Colorado. We went up to Creede  and spent two or three weeks there and then came back home. And some  way or other, the man that owned the cabin in Colorado, Daddy knew,  and he wanted to sell it. So, Daddy and Mother went up and looked at it,  and the following summer, we went up, the children. Daddy bought it.  He bought it at Christmastime, and all of us got a little note saying that  we all owned a cabin in Colorado.  Oh, that   s neat.  So, that   s how those started happening.  And so from then on, we went to Colorado every summer. We went the  day after Memorial Day and came home the day after Labor Day.  Instead of going to D.C., then?  Well, my grandmother had died by that time. So, we went to Colorado  and spent the whole summer there. We didn   t even hear   the radio  didn   t work. We didn   t have a telephone, so we never heard about the  19  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  war. We didn   t hear anything up there. We went to town once a week,  we went to mass. And Mother would get us up at five o   clock in the  morning to get dressed to get ready to go to church because it was an  hour   s drive in town, then, and we   d go in to mass and then go have  breakfast in town and buy a newspaper, The Denver Post, because it was  thick. It was a real thick paper. Oh, we   d have more fun going home  with that. And my brothers loved to shoot, and Mother would stop and  let them shoot rattlesnakes on the way home. (Laughter) Oh, Lord.  And then did Papa come up to the cabin?  He came twice. He came in July, on Fourth of July that time. He   d stay a  week, and then he came the last two weeks in August.  At Silver Lakes, did the other women bring their children up for the  summer, also?  Yes, the Joneses did, and they were the only ones, I think, that stayed as  long. Aunt Carrie stayed all summer, but she had no children. And  Charlotte and Bill and Harvey, Jr. were the three Jones kids, and they  were the only ones up there continually.  Was Bill Veazey friends with your mom or your dad?  Who?  Bill Veazey.  He   s more my age.  Oh, he is?  Yes.  Oh.  Violet, his mother, was a good friend of Mother   s.  Did they vacation with you or anything?  No.  What are some engineering projects that your father worked on?  He worked for the state, and he was, I guess, really intelligent because  all these universities kept wanting him to come and teach. (Laughs) And  20  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  he specialized, I guess, in water resources. I think that was what I would  consider his specialty after he got older. Originally, it was construction,  but it changed. So, I guess that was it, I don   t know.  And did he do a lot of projects around Oklahoma City or did he travel?  Well, he worked for the State Health Department with water projects. I  never paid any attention to what he did.  Wasn   t he involved with the Lake Heffner Project?  Yes, he was on that, but he   there   s a big picture of him over at the  State Health Department. I don   t know. I   ve never seen it, but my  brothers told me that. So, I don   t know.  Well, when did you start feeling the effects of the Depression? Were you  aware that     I was never truly aware of it. My sister said she was. I felt like I had  everything I wanted, so, I mean, why would I be aware of it? And I  didn   t have   I don   t think children then had great wants like they do  now. Like, a book was, to me, the best thing you could give me, and  things like that. So, I didn   t feel it. Now, my sister says,    Well, I thought  we were poor.    (Laughs) I said,    I didn   t think that at all. It never  dawned on me.    I must have been dumb, but I never thought. I really  didn   t have any great wants. I can   t think of anything that I wanted and  didn   t get. I wanted a dog, and my grandfather gave me the money to go  buy a dog. And that was something that all of us shared, so I don   t  know. That was funny, I bought this dog before, while I was in high  school, and it got pregnant, the dog did. And while I was, of course, at  Saint Vincent, Momma named those five pups, Eenie, Meenie, Minie,  Moe, and Annabell. (Laughter) So, she sent me a picture of the pups.  When you were in school, were you able to just call frequently and visit  with the family?  I thought when they sent me to school, I thought,    Well, they   re getting  rid of me.     She was thirteen.  Yes. Oh, I thought it was awful. And I called home every night. Well, in  those days, Daddy had to accept the cost of the phone call. You couldn   t  call like you can today, and the operator would say,    Would you accept  this call?    and, of course, Daddy had to say yes. Well, after about a  month, he told me I couldn   t do that anymore. He said,    You   ve got to  21  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  learn to like that school.    So, I learned to like it. (Laughs) And I did. I  loved it before it was over with.  Is that where you graduated from high school?  Yes, and we had our fiftieth reunion, and all of us were there. How they  found us, I   ll never know because the school is gone. It was close to  town and all of that   s been torn down, and it   s all gone. And the nuns,  now, are back up in Cincinnati where they came from, and I thought,     This is strange.    But all of us were there except one lady, but she lived  in Santa Fe. And we asked,    Well, why isn   t she there?    She didn   t want  her boyfriend to know how old she was, so she wouldn   t come. (Laughs)  How many people were in your class?  Twenty-five.  And was it all women?  Oh, yes. It was a girl   s school. The boy   s school was down the block.  Would you ever see the boys?  Oh, yes. We had dances, and I   m sure the boys hated it as much as we  did. (Laughs) And we had a house   the school where we lived was here,  and then there was an adobe house where we had our meals, and the  cook was there and everything. Then we had another little house on the  same property where we had to be hostess. We were taught to be  hostesses, and you had a night where you   d be a hostess, or you would  have   well, you   d figure out what to serve. We had to figure, and you  had to do your own cooking. One girl, one night, did hers, and she made  chili. Well, Lord, have mercy, she cut up nothing but pork chops and  threw it in a pan, and then we had to eat it. (Laughter) It wasn   t any  more chili    It was just burned pork chops. (Laughter) And that girl  ended up marrying the senator from New Mexico, and her wedding was  in the Life Magazine. And, oh, I kept thinking,    That poor man is going  to starve to death.     Hopefully they had a cook. (Laughs)  I   ll never forget that. Oh, Lord. Then we had the math instructor from  University of New Mexico came two nights a week to teach us bridge,  so we had to learn bridge. It was a good school.  How did your parents select that school?  22  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  I was ill a lot as a child. I had asthma and would get worse, and so a  doctor told them that they had to get me out of Oklahoma. And that was  partly the reason the cabin was bought because I couldn   t stay here in  the summer. And so, my aunt, Mother   s oldest sister, was driving to  California, and she stopped in Albuquerque, and she found that school,  and she called Mother and told Mother,    This is where Betty ought to  be.    And so, that   s where I ended up being. And I wouldn   t have traded  for it. The teachers we had must have been very, very good because my  first, almost, two years in college, it was like a repeat. Particularly my  chemistry and biology and stuff like that. I couldn   t believe they had  taught us so much. But there were so few of us, it was easier to teach, I  think. So, I don   t know.  Did your parents ever come visit you there?  No, nobody came.  Would you come home for Christmas?  I came at Christmas.  And during the summer?  And the summer I went   they   d come by and pick me up and take me to  Colorado. So, no.  Where did you go to college?  I went to Leavenworth, Kansas, Saint Mary   s. It   s a university now, and  my Grandmother O   Neil was raised in Leavenworth. Her father, I guess,  worked for the railroad because he was from Ireland, and there were a  lot of Irish people working on the railroad. She went to that same school,  only she went to the high school, and I went to the college. She went to  high school there. Then I went to my internship at Charity Hospital.  What did you study in college?  Well, my degree is in science, but I   m a dietician. The Sister told me     my junior year I finished and I only had a few hours to graduate, and I  thought,    Oh, good, I can play.    She called me in and said,    I don   t think  you   re going to be       I was going to be a chemist.    I don   t think you   re  going to be good at that.    She said,    You like people, and you   ll be  isolated.    So, she suggested dietetics, and I don   t think I ever even  thought of it. So, I had to end up taking a whole heavy course the last  year of college. I was studying all the time, and then I, as I said, got my  internship at Charity and that was good. And at Charity, we were with  23  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  the Tulane students, medical students, which was good. So, anyway     Did you get a job after your internship?  A Sister hired me at Charity. A month later, VA opened up here, and my  mother said,    I think it   s time for you to come home.    And so, I applied,  didn   t think anything about it, I got the job   bang  The next thing I  knew I was on a plane coming to Oklahoma City. I never thought I   d  end up here in my life.  Where was Charity?  New Orleans. I had no intentions of being here, but here I am. Eighty-seven  years old.  How long did you work at the VA?  Thirty-five, almost forty years, almost. And I loved it. I was more an  administrator, which I liked. I liked the planning part and stuff like that.  It was just fun.  Well, how do you remember hearing about the start of the war?  How did I learn about it? I guess by reading and listening. And when the  war was over with, I was in New Orleans. That place was a madhouse  then, because a lot of the ships were in. You never saw so many sailors.  And the hospital in those days was the largest hospital. It had 3,000  patients, and it had different buildings. One was called Diver, and that  was for foreign ships that came into port and people were sick, so they  didn   t speak English. They spoke many languages. New Orleans was a  very, very interesting city, I thought. You learned a lot. It was fun.  What year did you graduate high school?  I graduated in    41.  So, you were there when Pearl Harbor was bombed?  In Kansas City on a Sunday night. That   s when we heard it on the radio,  Sunday night. And my cousin, who ended up a pilot, we drove over  looking at the Kansas City train station. It   s kind of   have you ever  been there?  Yes.  So, you know. It   s high. And we sat there and listened to the  24  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  announcement of war, not knowing what it was going to do to people or  things. We were so na  ve.  Did any of your immediate family members go?  No. My cousin that was with us that night was the only one in the  service. He was the only boy old enough to go. No, but we didn   t have  any. So, it was really nice that we didn   t have anybody, but we had to  pray hard for all of them.  Let   s talk a little bit more about Oklahoma City while you were growing  up and some businesses that you remember. Where would you go  shopping to buy clothing?  Brown   s, Johnny Brown   s.  That was a department store?  Oh, you didn   t know? It was huge  We thought it was huge.  Halliburton   s was on the corner. We went to Halliburton   s occasionally,  but I don   t know why Brown   s was the one we always wanted to go to.  Because it was so big, and had many departments, so we went to  Brown   s, and that   s a department store downtown. And then on  Sixteenth and Indiana   is that correct? Yes. They had a little shopping  center. We had TG Y, Patty   s Hardware store, with gifts. They had  gifts in there. (Laughs) And what was the name of the shop that had     you could buy underwear and everything? Golly, I can   t remember.  Anyway, it was more like a variety store, too, down further, and then the  bakery was in between. We had a good bakery there. It was a nice little  shopping center, and we   d go up there. But if you wanted clothes, you   d  go downtown to Johnny Brown   s.  What about shoes?  Shoes? That   s where I got my shoes. Mrs. Harold had the shoe  department, and you   d get them from her. And I wore   what do you call  them? Girl Scout shoes. Do you remember those?  No.  They were tie-up shoes and white because I was working in the hospital.  So, I always bought my shoes from Mrs. Harold. She was nice. But you  could buy anything up   Halliburton   s is where she was, on the balcony.  I don   t think either of you have ever been in Halliburton   s because it was  closed. They had a balcony all around, so you could look down at the  first floor, and they had a, like, you could have your coffee and tea or  25  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  lunch there and just enjoy life. And then on one side was Mrs. Harold,  and you got your shoes there.  Did she work for Halliburton?  I   m sure she did, or had a contract with them because when they closed,  she had her own store and her daughter helped her for a long time.  Was she related to Harold   s, the clothing store?  I don   t know whether she is or not, but she was a real nice lady. She fit  everybody, and she had   she x-rayed your foot. You   d go in and you  could put your foot in this, and you could look at all the bones in your  foot. Oh, we thought that was wonderful.  Yes, that sounds wonderful. (Laughter)  Well, it was if the shoe fit correctly, your foot was supposed to lay some  way, and she   d look to make sure that it fit.  How high-tech.  So, oh, we thought that was wonderful.  Is that where Gran got all her beautiful beaded shoes and     Oh, no, she got hers someplace else. Oh, no, these were more working-type  shoes. The kind Momma wore, no thank you.  She dressed to the nines all the time.  Would she shop in Oklahoma City or did she shop other places?  She shopped basically here. What was the name? There was a man that  owned   what was the name of that? I can   t think of the name of the  store. And when he would go to market, he would bring things back that  he thought Mother would like. So, that   s how she would get her clothes.  And at the grocery store, we mentioned sometimes     Kamp   s?  Yes, you could take a list and give it to someone and wait?  Yes.  26  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Will you tell about that?  Well, I don   t think I ever did that. We called and made our list. We  didn   t go to the grocery store. They delivered for us. They delivered for  anybody at that point in time. How strange people were   the Kamps are  German, and old Mr. Kamp, Henry Kamp, had a very heavy accent. And  people, for a while, thought,    Oh, they   re mixed up with the Nazis,    and  this kind of stuff. Can you imagine? They weren   t at all. And so, but yes,  I think it hurt their business for a while, but after that, some sense came  into their mind.  And how did things change once the war started?  Well, first of all, gasoline was rationed, sugar was rationed   what else?  Butter.  Oh, yes, butter. But we had the farm, so we got all the butter we needed,  and all the meat we needed, and everything came from the farm, and the  milk and the milk products.  Where was your farm?  Well, where Edmond is today. (Laughs) It wasn   t very far away. And  we   d go out there, and Daddy had that couple that   they did it on  halves. Daddy supplied all the cattle and all the feed and all that, and  those people took care of it. And we got whatever we needed to run the  household. They could sell what they wanted, and they made enough  money to buy a farm up in Western Oklahoma.  Was that the one on Post Road and 155th or so?  Yes. It was fifty-two acres.  How often would you go there?  Well, we used to go, as kids, we would go out there a lot because they  had a creek, and we   d go barefoot in the creek and think that was  wonderful, too. (Laughter) See, I told you we didn   t need a lot to make  us happy. But it was fun. Well, it had quicksand, kind of   or it really  wasn   t quicksand, I don   t think. But your feet, you would go down about  that far, and then there was water again. And, oh, we thought that was  really something. (Laughter)  Was there a place in Oklahoma City that you would go swimming?  27  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Yes, we would   you   re asking me where to go? The Paseo was there,  on Paseo, had a swimming   it was upstairs in this building, and then  Spring Lake and Shepherd   s Lake     Old Mr. Shepherd.  Yes. We went to Shepherd   s Lake a lot, which was fun. And I   m trying  to think. Well, later on we went other places, but then those were the  ones, really, when we were young. And then, of course, when we  weren   t  in Colorado  in the summer we swam in the lake.  Did you ever join Dad when he would jump on old Mr. Shepherd   s  horses and try to ride his horses out there?  No.  You weren   t ever shot at by Mr. Shepherd, like Dad? (Laughter)  No, he would get angry. Those kids were awful, and it only cost ten  cents to go swimming in his pool. It had snakes in it and everything else,  and we all went, didn   t even pay any attention. Just get in the   oh, Lord.  (Laughter)  Did your mom drive you there, or did you always     We walked. It wasn   t that far. Mother didn   t have to drive us, no.  That   s great.  We were crazy. But Oklahoma City has changed because when we were  small, my father had a friend named Julius Caesar   an acquaintance, not  a friend   and he took us out to Julius Caesar   s farm. That farm was  probably on McArthur, and about, maybe, Tenth and McArthur,  somewhere out there. It wasn   t far from the river. And he made sausage,  and Daddy liked his sausage, and that   s why we went out there. He also  made wine, and being an Italian, and he was   Julius Caesar was for  piddly, really, and he spoke more like an Italian than an American. And  he set the four of us down and gave us all a glass of wine.  You were children?  Yes, we all got a glass of wine. Well, the four of us thought we   d been  poisoned. We had never tasted wine before. We wouldn   t even swallow  it. (Laughter) Oh, it was horrible. We were so rude, and Daddy didn   t  say a word until he got out, and he said,    That was wine.    We didn   t  know what we were drinking, anyway. He said,    That was wine, and he  28  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  had made it.    And Daddy said it was pretty good wine, but we didn   t  think so. For years, I wouldn   t touch wine. I love wine today. (Laughter)  That   s why I   m saying that. But then I thought,    Huh-uh,    but he gave  all   like all Italians, they all drink it from little on up. So, it wasn   t  anything unusual for him. But for us, it was very unusual. But that was  farm country. You could go past May, and there weren   t hardly any  houses, and then all of a sudden they started building. Kind of like  today, like they   re going north. They went west.  West of May was barren?  Yes.  Wow.  Oklahoma City wasn   t very big. It wasn   t a very big town, and people  left their doors open and never thought about anybody robbing anybody  or any bad things happening. No, It was just a pleasant place to live,  except the summer when it got so hot.  What were some social activities your parents would engage in? You  mentioned bridge parties.  Yes. They   d bridge party, and they were golfers. They loved to golf.  And then they played poker. Yes. Every Saturday night there was poker,  not at our house, but at this   there were six or eight of them at their     they would rotate who had it. And they had kind of a dinner before time,  or maybe during the poker game. I don   t know. Momma fixed a roast or  Dorothy, somebody did and put it on the table and set the table for the  people to come. We had a Pointer. He was about this    (Gestures) Well,  he got in the house, and he ate the meat, and I thought my mother    I  could hear my mother. She was so upset. (Laughter) She nearly died.  But what can you do?  What did they do?  What did they do?  Yes.  Just take that plate off the table and have no meat that night. No meat at  all. That was awful.  Did they go to dances?  Yes. They belonged to the Joy de Vie, yes.  29  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Darcey  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  What   s that?  It   s a club, and it   s still in operation.  What is it called?  Joy de Vie.  And they would hold regular dances?  Yes. They went to dances, and they had, I think, a very happy life until  my father had a stroke. So, that made a difference. One time, Mother  was, I guess, at a bridge party. I don   t know. Daddy was at work, and I  was home, and Pete was   I guess the boys were home. And Pete came  downstairs, and I was in the kitchen with Dorothy, and he said,    Betty,  come up and see my little fire.    He had     How old was he, about?  He was probably about four or five.  Okay.  He said,    Come up and see it.    Well, he set the curtains in Mother   s  bedroom on fire, and in those days they had real fluffy curtains. So,  fortunately, I called Dorothy, Dorothy called the fire department, and I  was taking water from the bathroom and trying to put it out. We got it  out before the fire department came, but he thought that was really  beautiful. (Laughter) Oh, golly.  Did you always have indoor plumbing?  Yes.  Did most people that you knew in Oklahoma City?  Everybody in our area did, yes. I don   t know anybody that didn   t unless  you lived out in the country like Julius Caesar. They didn   t, and nor did  the farm have indoor plumbing. It was outdoors.  What about electricity? When did you     We all had electricity, yes. Because think about   electricity, Mother  grew up with it, so   and grew up with indoor plumbing, so all the  houses in Heritage Hills all had indoor plumbing and all that. And that   s  30  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  where my mother grew up.  So, did she mostly grow up in Oklahoma City?  Yes, yes. They were known as the five beautiful O   Neils, the girls. And  ten o   clock was their time, O   Neil clock. Grandpa said they couldn   t be  out after ten o   clock, and he had them all home at ten o   clock at night.  Except, of course, Irene, and Irene, one of them went to New York to  study at the Metropolitan and married a Greek. That wasn   t what she  should have done. (Laughter) None of the other girls could leave  Oklahoma.  She spoiled it for the rest of them.  She did, really.  Well, what are some lessons or values you learned growing up that  you   ve carried throughout your life?  Honesty and integrity and love God. We are a very religious family, so I  would say that. That would be the main thing. And enjoy life. I think all  of us have enjoyed our life.  Education, also.  What?  I think education is a very prominent     Yes, we were all well-educated, thank God. And in those times, not  everybody got to, particularly girls, to college. My sister hated it with a  bitter passion, and after a year and a half, she quit, but she wouldn   t stay.  Did your brothers and sisters stay around Oklahoma in their adult lives?  Yes, both my brothers did. And my sister   s husband did, and then he got  transferred to Tulsa.  How did you meet your husband?  Well, actually, it   s unusual. He lived across the street from us on Cary  Place. I didn   t know him. My mother really knew his wife. She died  several years   oh, quite a number of years ago now. I took Mother to  the funeral, and then Mother insisted on having him over for dinner, and  his son, which we did. And then he had us over, and then that started it.  Then he took me to go down the rapids, down at Talihina. It was on a  31  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  weekend, and so we went to mass over in Arkansas, and Father  introduced us as a married   he said he wanted his people to meet Mr.  and Mrs. Tyrrell, and then I turned as red as I could be. I wasn   t any  more married than a hootenanny. (Laughter) Anyway, that started it, and  from that time on he called every day at eight o   clock in the morning to  noon, six o   clock in the evening and ten o   clock at night.  To check in on you?  Yes, until we got married.  When did you get married?  When was it?  This will shock you.  What?  This will shock you   her. This will shock Latasha.  We were married in September 25, 1985.  Her first marriage. And you were sixty     Whatever. I don   t remember.  Sixty-one.  Yes, and we did nothing but travel.  How fun   We drove all the way to Alaska, and then drove every road in Alaska.  (Laughter) Then we went   he was from the east. We went to his home  every year, and we would either go up through the state of Washington  and across Canada or go to up where he lived, then up through Maine,  and then to Montreal, and then through Canada and down. I   ve seen  Canada from one side to the other. (Laughter)  So, you were retired by then?  Yes. I went to work on The Feast of Our Lady, and I quit on The Feast  of Our Lady, August 15th, and that   s what my goal was, to quit on that  day.  32  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  What was your profession?  She knows. I already told her I was a dietician. Yes. But anyway, we had  fun.  So, you retired in what year?  The same year that I got married.    85.     85, as the head dietician at the VA?  Yes.  In Oklahoma City.  Director of Dietetics is what the title was. Doesn   t that sound big?  (Laughter) But it was fun. When I first got   I   ll never forget this,  though. When I first took over the VA dietetics section, I was twenty-three  or four, something like that. There was a dietician there and they  transferred her and left me there. I was the only one, and I had thirty-six  men, all of them older than I, working. And I thought,    Oh, my gosh   What am I going to do?    Well, one of them, the head cook, was telling  them that he wasn   t going to take orders from me. He was going to do  this, that, and the other, and I could just go jump in the lake. I was in  back of him, and he didn   t know it. (Laughter) And the men were  looking at me and hearing all this, so I said to him,    You   ll take orders  from me until they appoint somebody else.    Well, I was shaking, so I  went to the canteen, and I didn   t get up from that place for a good two  hours. I didn   t even want to look at those men  But from that time on, I  never had a problem. And one thing I did tell them,    You can   t cuss in  front of me or any lady,    and they never did. They might among  themselves, but they didn   t cuss around me. I said,    I won   t put up with  that.    And I don   t know how I had the nerve. The blessed Mother did it.  Did you feel like you had many other challenges, being a woman?  Probably, because you had to sell yourself and your service, so to speak,  to directors. And they transferred directors, it seemed like, at a  whipstitch in those days. We   d have one for a couple of years, and then  another and another. And if you wanted your share of the budget, you   d  better do something good. Show them what you can do. Not verbally,  but physically and mentally.  With the work that you accomplished.  Yes, so it was interesting. It was a enjoyable time, and towards the end, I  33  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Wilson  Tyrrell  worked in the office of the director a lot, and I thoroughly enjoyed that.  And I planned the budget for the residents and things like that. I have  one staff physician I   ll never forget that I sat with until eight o   clock at  night because he couldn   t figure out what the salary of a fifth   a fifth of  a doctor   s salary. That   s all it was, and he   I tried to tell him, I did  everything, and he never got it. And this went on for about four hours. I  thought,    I give up. I don   t know what else to tell him.    Put little things  on the ground and say,    Here, this is a fifth,    but he couldn   t figure his  budget at all. That was what the problem was because he had mostly  partial. The VA and the university paid salaries together, so the VA  might pay the dermatologist 50 percent, where they might pay the  orthopod 10 percent, and it was all kind of mixed up like that, and he  couldn   t get it in his head. I   ve often wondered what he   s doing now.  When you started working at the VA, did you take the bus to work, also?  Oh, yes, had to leave at six o   clock in the morning to get out there. That  was because the bus didn   t   and it was the Nichols Hills bus is what it  was called, and Nichols Hills, it was owned by Nichols Hills, and it was  an old, rattly bus. Oh, it was awful. But the bus driver would cross the     you know where the planes come in landing? She   d just go across the  field like that. (Laughter) She would go to the airport first, and then to  the hospital. It was on the other side, and she   d just go  across the  tarmac . Her name was May,  and she knew all her passengers and  greeted us each day. She was a nice lady.   Right across the tarmac?  Yes. She didn   t bother.  Wow. What time would you get home at night?  Usually about eight or nine because of the bus.  So, you were pretty busy.  Yes. It was a fun time, though. Thank God I was young.  You still have many friends and people that you keep in contact with  from that experience.  Well, besides traveling, what are some other things you   ve done in  retirement?  Let   s see, I volunteer at church and University Hospital, too.  34  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  And?  I play bridge occasionally.  What about PARB? Will you tell us about that?  PARB. The Post Adjudication Review Board.  Yes, I know, but I don   t know what to tell you. I   m thinking.  Well, will you tell us what it is?  Yes, surely. The department of DHS has all these kids in foster homes or  some kind of a home that they have taken because the parents are not  taking care of the children, or so they say. And their cases have to be  reviewed every three months by the court. And what we do is get the  cases. They send you so many cases a month, and then you call the  social worker or anyone that you want to, to find out how the children  are doing or whatever   s going on with them. You write it up and then  recommend what you think should be done so that the judge doesn   t  have to go through the files, that he knows that   s fairly current, and so  he can make his decisions. And some of it is really sad. And I didn   t get  to read the morning paper, but there   s headlines that somebody over in  Chandler, I think, resigned from DHS because of a case that, apparently,  I don   t know what the case was, and another one that was on it  committed suicide. So, I   m anxious to read that particular thing, but I  looked at my watch, and I thought,    She   s coming for me, and I   ve got  to get out of here.     And how many years have you served on this board?  Over twenty-five years. So, I   ve been doing it a long time.  And you usually have approximately three to five cases a month?  This new supervisor only sends four, which is better because you have  more time to get a hold of your people. And I, unfortunately, didn   t     I   ve called all of mine, but none of them returned my call. Summer is a  bad time to get a hold of people. So, I don   t know. I   m anxious because  one girl I have this time   and you don   t know who it is   her sister is  doing well. She   s seventeen and has a child. And from what I read, she   s  so intelligent that they think she   s going to get a couple scholarships for  college. And then I looked through the file and that was in May. Here in  this month, she   s at Saint Anthony   s hospital because she cut herself.  And so, I   m anxious to know what happened to her. Something bad  happened. You feel so sorry for those children, you really do, because  35  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  your life is so easy compared to theirs, and the  lives of  people you  know are usually easy. So, I don   t know. It   s kind of sad when you think  about it.  But it   s wonderful you   ve been involved helping with that.  Well, it   s fun to do   not fun, but you feel like you   ve accomplished  something. Sometimes you do and sometimes you don   t.  Well, what does Oklahoma mean to you?  Oklahoma means home. (Laughs) It means home, literally. I think it   s a  wonderful place. I love it. I really do.  Have you ever considered living anywhere else?  No. I like the people, I think the people are wonderful, and I like  everything. The only thing I don   t like is the hot weather. I don   t like  105 weather. It bothers me, and that   s one reason I left Oklahoma, but  it   s okay. I think that   s fine. I think you   re so sweet to do this.  Well, I have one more question.  Okay.  When history is written about you, how would you like to be  remembered?  Oh, good Lord, I don   t know. (Laughter)  Our Wednesday dinners?  Yes, let   s see, I guess that I   m an aunt, number one, because I have a lot  of nieces and nephews.  Who adore her.  Oh, no. But anyway, I have a lot of nieces and nephews, and I have two  darling grandchildren   three, really. I   m forgetting the boy, but two  girls, one twenty-one, one sixteen, and a thirteen year old boy. And they  all left today for North Carolina. And let   s see, who else? What else?  That I   m a grandmother, and I was a cherished wife. That   s a good one.  That   s for her.  That was true.  36  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Darcey  Tyrrell  Wilson  Tyrrell  Wilson  And a devout Catholic.  I was spoiled rotten. (Laughter) And let   s see what else.  Deservedly.  I guess that   s it.  Catholic, a devout Catholic.  Oh, yes. That   s the main thing of my life, and it   s how I   ve survived  because I   ve had cancer three times and gone through chemo and all  that, and I   ve just come out fine.  Yes. You did.  And I don   t get to exercise. I figure God   s going to take care of me, and  Lord knows he has.  You look great.  Thank you, but it does make a difference. Yes, I think when I lost Bob     you hear about people going so depressed, I just went to church and let  God take care of it for me. He did.  Well, thank you so much for visiting with me today.  Well, thank you for doing this. You   re very patient.  Thank you for being here also,  Maggie.   -------  -------
