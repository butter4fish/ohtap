Story_ID: 8557
Speaker 1: Can you give us the names of your parents and their birth dates and spell their names for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Helen Autmesia (ph.) Lawson.  And my father's name is Albert Otis Howze, Sr. Unfortunately, I don't remember their birth dates, but I do know that my father was twenty-two years old when I was born.  I am seventy-nine now.  Therefore, my father would be a hundred and one.  My mother was about three years--two years, three years than my father.  I do have those facts.
Speaker 1: So they were born around the turn of the century then?
Speaker 2: Correct, correct.  My father was born around the year 1900 and my mother was, must have been born 1898 or something in that area.
Speaker 1: Now, where was your father born?
Speaker 2: My father was born in Mobile County, Plateau, Alabama.  And my mother in Daphne, Baldwin County, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Are those close by each other?
Speaker 2: Right.  I don't know where they met or when they met, but I do know that my father--from my birth certificate, I do know he was twenty-two years old when I was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have any idea of what your ancestors were doing during the slavery period or during the early period?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's father was--his name was Elijah Lawson.  And I do know when he was born.  He was born in 1864.  And my mother's mother's name was Louise Davis.  And I don't know her birth date.  But as a teenager, I was responsible for caring for them when they were elderly.  And, of course, at that time, we had no nursing homes.  So that was my job to take care of those two people.  My father, my grandfather was a, a mulatto, very fair in complexion, I mean, and my mother was--grandmother was darker.  And they had eight children--six or eight children.  And I think my mother was about number three or four of the children.  And they died in 1937.  I know because I was taking care of them, both of them.  My father, grandfather was born, as I say, in 1864.  So he was born just before civil, Civil War time.  And my grandmother, I don't know where she was born.  I do know that my grandmother's mother lived with us.  So I had, when I was a small kid, I do know my great grandmother on my mother's side.  And she was naturally a slave, a product of slavery somewhere along the line.  But that was about it.  And, of course, my grandfather bought about a hundred and eighty acres back in those days in Baldwin County, and it was homesteaded.  So he owned all of that property, and when he died, and when the family died, they divided it up between their children and their grandchildren.  And I still have my property there in Baldwin County.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any stories that survived from that, from the nineteenth century that you, that have passed down through the family, any stories or songs or anything that (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well, I do know that I kind of grew up with my mother's parents because my mother died when I was at the age of five.  And, of course, at that time, my father was a kind of younger man, and, of course, he married again.  And, of course, they, they--so I spent--and my brother and myself spent most of our teenage years, right up in our teenage, with my grandparents.  So I remember a few things about my grandfather.  He was a deacon in the Baptist church, and, and I was very close to him.  I used to go with him to the church, and I was very active with him.  And my mother's youngest sister lived there with us, and she was a teacher.  She taught us in a little old country school, and one-room country school with all of the kids in one room, she taught us.  And we lived in that kind of area for all of our years.  And, of course, as a kid growing up, I was very active in the Sunday school because my grandfather was very active in the, in the Baptist church.  So I do remember that we did a lot of things as a family, and in those days, the minister who was--I never will forget his name, was Reverend Scott.  He used to live with my grandparents when he would come around, kind of a circuit preacher like.  And, of course, I do remember those days when the preacher was there and was eating, we waited until he finished (laughs).  And then we ate later.  But my grandfather was a big farmer, both he was a farmer in regular farming, and he was also a turpentine farmer..  Therefore, he, they took turpentine from trees, cut trees and, and sold it to different distilleries.  And, of course, as a kid growing up, my grandfather--my mother's father, that is, grandfather, knew Jason Malbis (ph.).  Malbis was a Greek.  He came from Greece.  He settled in Chicago, and then he came to Baldwin County, and he settled a lot of Baldwin County.  So I kind of grew up in the Greek culture too for a little while, for a little while.  And so my grandfather knew Jason Malbis very well, and Jason Malbis died in Greece, but his body, body was brought back.  And he's buried in the Greek church there in, in Daphne.
Speaker 1: So this is Jason?
Speaker 2: Jason, J-A-S-O-N.
Speaker 1: Jason Malbis, how do you spell his last name?
Speaker 2: M-A-L-B-I-S.
Speaker 1: Now, is he noted for something in--?
Speaker 2: Well, the, when the Greeks came, they, as I said, they owned just about a lot of property there.  And, of course, they had a dairy farm, they had a bakery.  They had all of this.  And as a youngster, I worked in the diary.  So most of the Greeks are deceased now.  And it's no longer there.  I understand that Mal--Jason Malbis was in the seminary at one time in Greece, himself, and when he came here and settled in Daphne, most of the young Greeks who came with him, they almost lived like, in a monastic life.  So they weren't married.  So they didn't have a lot of children to come from those, the product of those families.  So, as I say, when I go back now, the place is still there, but I see very few people that I recognize.
Speaker 1: Now, what kind of a person was your father?
Speaker 2: My father grew up in Plateau, Alabama.  Now, my father is also a product of a very large family.  He is number two of a family of thirteen.  And when I, I never know--in those days, you didn't ask a lot of questions cause I don't know where my father met my mother.  But, as I said, he was a little, about a couple of years younger than my mother.  And when they got married, I guess, presume it was around '22 [1922] because I was born in '23 [1923].  And my father, as a young man, worked in Mobile, Ala--in Alabama in a, in a drugstore called Van Naeswerst (ph.), where it was a Dutch drugstore.  The store is still there--the building is still there, but I don't know what it is now.  And so he worked in--they had an ice cream factory, and he worked there.  And then after that he worked for the International Paper Company.  And then, when I was growing up, and then later on, he worked at, as a truck driver.  And, and that's what he was going when he became ill and died.  My grandfather died in 1991, right at the time of the Gulf War that was going on over in the Middle East.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather died when--?
Speaker 2: My father died, my father.  My mother died when I, as I said, 1928, when I was only five years old.
Speaker 1: Your father lived a long time.
Speaker 2: He did live a long time.  And he was in good form until he got sick.
Speaker 1: Now, what did your mother die of?
Speaker 2: My mother died of child birth really.  And she, it was, she gave birth to my sister, youngest sister who was five years younger than I am.  And she died at childbirth, and, of course, that sister grew up.  And she married and had nine kids herself, so that's the background of that.  I did have a brother next to me who was killed in an automobile accident in Mobile about two years ago, two or three years ago.  But he was just a year younger than I am.
Story_ID: 8558
Speaker 1: Can you think back, and try to give us some idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in--?
Speaker 2: Well, grew up, my early days, I grew up in Mobile, my--because my father and mother lived there.  And as a youngster I remembered going to Catholic school.  And this family lived next door to my parents and their name was Ignatius Durant (ph.)  And the oldest, the youngest daughter of that family, her name was Josephine, she would take me to school.  And, of course, I remember that very well now because I was in Chicago last year, and I spent the time with her four sons who I consider very close because I was so close to their mother.  And also, from that same family I--because at that time, I wasn't Catholic.  But after I started teaching in Mobile in 1948, one of my students was a grandson of that Durant family.  And, of course, he, he was my student in high school.  I taught him in high school.  And now, he's a physician in Mobile.  As a matter of fact, he, he spoke at the celebration I had the other night for the boy scouts award.  But my closest memory of growing up with that family, was the Durant family growing up.  And then before my--my mother had three children besides myself--two others besides myself.  My brother, Albert, and then I had another brother named Oswald.  Oswald died as an infant.  In those days, they didn't know a whole lot about--he died of dehydration, really.  And they wouldn't, didn't know too much about it in that time.  But after my brother, and then he died.  And then my parents moved back to Baldwin County, where my sister was born, and that's where my mother died.  And that was in 1928.  And I think the date was October 1, 1928.  So my sister, if she were alive now, she would be seventy-four years old I believe, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you were about five years old--?
Speaker 2: I was five years older than my sister, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, did you remember your, how people felt when your mother died?
Speaker 2: Well, I do remember when my mother died.  And, of course, we were living in the country at that time.  I remember some particular things because in those days, the funeral director came to, to the house and did the preparation of my mother's body.  I remember that.  And, of course, I remember seeing it one day.  I have that vision, but I didn't go to the funeral.  I remember that very well.  They didn't take me to the funeral, and, but I have very good memory of my mother's death.
Speaker 1: So you spent a lot of time with--you were basically raised by another--?
Speaker 2: I was basically raised by my grandparents.  And then after they died, by my youngest uncle.  And then after that, then I moved back to Mobile with my father and his wife, my stepmother.
Story_ID: 8559
Speaker 1: What kind of a little boy were you and what kind of things did you do for fun and what were you interested in?
Speaker 2: I was a kind of a--and if my brother were alive, he would tell you, that I was the kind of kid, they thought I was reading all the time, and, and doing anything but working.  But, I, I worked, but I was, I was a kind of a bookworm (unclear) kid.  And, and as a result, I graduated a valedictorian in high school.  And I think I was a salutatorian in college and things like that.
Speaker 1: But your family gave you the latitude to read as much as you wanted?
Speaker 2: I read as much--and it's, you'd be surprised.  We didn't have libraries and things like that.  We didn't have television.  We didn't radio.  We didn't have a lot of those things.  I wish we'd have had it.  It would certainly made me a little bit more alert about a lot of things around me.  And that's the reason I think sometimes I wonder about youngsters' background, when they're given examinations like other kids.  If I had been examinations like a big city kid, I probably would have flunked because I didn't have that kind of background with a lot of other things to, to--there were no libraries near me.  I don't remember getting a newspaper.  And I know we didn't have a radio.  We didn't have electricity.  We had lamps, kerosene lamps to study by.  So it's strange how you, you really developed and, and survived.  But we didn't have many of the modern things, but I was--in spite of that, I was kind of a, I was interested in books.  And when I got one, I read it.
Speaker 1: What were some of your favorite books when you were a young person?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I liked biography when I was a kid.  I would--and one of the stories that I remembered reading greatly was George Washington--Booker T. Washington's 'Up from Slavery', I believe was the name.  I think I read it a dozen times, over and over again.  And, of course, living in, in Alabama, I was aware of Tuskegee Institute where Booker T. Washington found and also George Washington Carver, I was aware of that.  So I certainly was interested in biography a lot.
Speaker 1: What other kinds of activities did you engage in when you were a youngster?
Speaker 2: Well, we did a lot of fishing, naturally.  And you didn't have to go far to fish, any creek you could fish in, in those days.  And, and, of course, we lived near the water.  We lived, not--Baldwin County is not too far from the beaches.  And so we had a chance to be on the beaches.  And in those, those days, you could get clams that, you could just pick clams anywhere, but today, you, I guess pollution has killed the things.  But, but those were some of the things we--I don't remember playing any sports in high school.  I don't remember playing any.  But I was an observer, I saw them, but I didn't play them.
Story_ID: 8560
Speaker 1: Were there any particular teachers in grade school that inspired you?
Speaker 2: Yes, I had a teacher in, in grade school.  One was my own--my mother's sister.  She taught me.  She was a little woman but was a very strong--and I remember her very much.  But another one was named Mrs. Williams.  And she really taught me to write.  And my penmanship, if I have any, was due to this lady.  She was a great, in penmanship in those days.  And I think I imitated, and I think my writing is an imitation of her.  I remember very well.  And then I went to school with her kid, her, her son, Boudreau (ph.), I went, was in high school with him.  So I remembered him very well.  Then I have, another lady was Ms. Ramsey.  She taught me in grade school.  And, and I do remember having some excellent teachers, both in elementary and high school, in spite of the, the lack of things.  And, of course, they were segregated schools.  And, and all of--but the teachers were very much interested in a student's welfare.  So I, I can go back and tell you, I had some great teachers in both elementary and high school.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your elementary school?
Speaker 2: It was a little country school, called, we called it Turkey Branch.  And it was really part of the Baptist church there, but it was a public school.  But it was a one-room, public school.  And when I go back to, to Daphne now, and we--and talk with my cousins, we talk about the days when we, we were students there.  Then after that, then I went--of course, my earliest schools was in Mobile in the Catholic school.  I did go to Catholic grade school, elementary school when I was a kid.  Then after my parents moved, we moved over to Daphne, I went from there to Baldwin County High School, which was all-black high school at that time.  And then I moved from there, when I was a teenager, after my relatives died, I moved to Mobile, back with the other cousin--a cousin of mine.  Her name was Susan Ensley (ph.).  She was a teacher in the public schools.  And I lived with her until I finished high school in Mobile.  Then from there, I went to the junior college in Mobile.  In 1946, I went to Montgomery, and I graduated in 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what was the name of the high school in Mobile?
Speaker 2: Mobile County Training School.
Speaker 1: Country--.
Speaker 2: Training School.  It's an unusual name because when I went to move from North Carolina, when a school had the name, training school, it was a school for, for kids who were having problems.  But in, in Alabama, most of the black schools were named Mobile or Baldwin, some kind of training school, name of county training school.  And I remembered my principals from both schools.  And, and my principal in high school, I--after I finished, I taught high school with him.  And he was Dr. Baker, who just died a few years ago.
Speaker 1: What was his first name?
Speaker 2: Benjamin F. Baker, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, was he like a role model for you?
Speaker 2: Super role model, yeah.  He was a super role model because he came to this little town of Plateau and really developed a school.  He also--it was a school here in Mississippi, he was a principal of the Thirty-Third Avenue School in Gulfport, Mississippi before he came to Mobile.  And he did a lot of wonderful things for developing young black kids in, at that era.  As a matter of fact, one of the students that, from our school was one of the first students to go to that Tuskegee Airmen School.  He was a graduate of that Tuskegee Airmen class.  I think his name was Leon Roberts.  And he, he got killed in active duty during the war.  And then he had other--Albert Murray was another one of his students.  He became a great writer.
Speaker 1: The writer?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You ever heard of Albert Murray?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, he was from my high school, yeah.  So, as I said, Dr. Baker was a great inspiration to a lot of kids.  I mean, and he couldn't operate today like he operated then, as a principal , but, but he was a great principal for, for the time, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what other activities, I mean what activities did you engage in, in high school?  Did you have much of a social life in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  We had a lot of social clubs in my high school.  And I, of course, I was involved in them, working with them.  I also worked with the principal's secretary, and I, I knew her after I grew up.  And I was active like that.  I didn't play in the band, (unclear) I wasn't in sports.  But I was just a regular student.
Speaker 1: What kind of clubs were you a part of?
Speaker 2: We had a club they called 'Just Us'.  It was an all-boy's club, we're in that club.  And, and I have pictures of that club I have at home now that (unclear).  And, of course, all of the kids with me, they would, they would be grandfathers or great grandfathers, if they're alive.
Story_ID: 8561
Speaker 1: Were you concerned about religion really as a youth, I mean did you (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, I was, I was a very active kid in the Baptist church as a youth as a matter of fact.  I was very active in the Sunday school.  I was elected teacher, and, of course, I had the idea of going off to school to study something religion.  I was very active in the High-Y, which was a kind of a religion organization for kids.  It's a part of the YMC[A], I think, and I was active in that.  And as I said, but I had some Catholic background because I went to Catholic school when I was small, so I was, that was my--the background of my being involved in Catholic.  But I really didn't become a Catholic until I was twenty-five years old.
Speaker 1: Did you, you think, did you compare basically the, your experiences in the Catholic school with the Baptist experience at all when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, I, I would say that when I got, grew up, and I became involved with the Catholic church, I was impressed with the, the liturgy of the Catholic church, the rites of service of the Catholic church.  I was impressed with, with scripture, how scripture was really involved.  Sometimes people think Catholics don't read the bible, but the, the bible is really a part of all of the Catholic structure, of the religion and their worship.  And, of course, after I finished college, I really wanted to go to Xavier--after I finished high school I wanted to go to Xavier University, and I wasn't Catholic then, but Xavier University--.
Speaker 1: In New Orleans, (unclear)?
Speaker 2: --in New Orleans because it was a very popular school.  It had a very great name even then.  I wanted to go to Xavier, but I didn't because I wasn't able to.  But, and I went to the University, Alabama State, which was called Alabama State for Negroes or something at that time.  You know, they've changed the name.  But that was my involvement, and then, as I said, I became Catholic after--while I was teaching public school.  And, and the kid that, that I taught, he is a physician now.  He was one of my students in high school.  And, and he was also one of the speakers recent at the, at the boy scout award that was given to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, well, what really led up to you becoming Catholic?  Now, you were teaching high school?
Speaker 2: I was teaching high school.  As I said, that I was involved with the Catholic church as a kid because I--and I went to a Catholic school.  So I wasn't a stranger to the Catholics, but basically, I guess what impressed me about the Catholic church, when I was a Catholic--when I was a student at the college, my roommate was Catholic.  His name was Herman Garnier, from New Orleans.  And Herman was a musician.
Speaker 1: Can you spell his name for us?
Speaker 2: G-A-R-N-I-E-R, Garnier.  And one thing impressed me about Herman was, he could play music all, all night on a Saturday night, but on a Sunday morning, he got up and went to mass.  And I used to go with him, and this kind of impressed me very much, of his example.  And I've tried to locate Herman since I've been--even in New Orleans, but I can't find him.  I don't know whether he's dead or alive, because he was a great, had a great impression upon me becoming a Catholic.  And so, that, that was some of my background.  Now, becoming a Catholic priest, well, I had a pastor, Father Vincent Warren was a Josephite (ph.) priest who was very active as a memory.  He was really like a Baptist preacher.  He sounded like (laughs) one, when he preached, but he was very ecumenical.  I used to travel with him to his missions and to--I used to play the music for him, for his churches.  And that's when I started becoming interested in the Catholic church, I mean in the priesthood.
Story_ID: 8562
Speaker 1: Bishop Howze, tell us how you became a priest.  And just, I mean this is a big decision--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because you give up a lot to be a--.
Speaker 2: I gave up--.
Speaker 1: --I mean to a secular person, to become is a--.
Speaker 2: I gave up my teaching position and all of that.  Well, what, when I became, thought of becoming a priest, it was, as I say, on the basis of Father Vincent Warren.  And when I began to tell people that I was gonna do that, I had no opposition from my family.  As a matter of fact, one of my greatest supporters was my uncle who was a Methodist minister.  And he, and he still--of course, he's suffering from Alzheimer's now, but he was my greatest supporter, and he worked with me all the way through.  So now, becoming--to get accepted to study for the priesthood was a problem though for me.  In those days, the local bishops in the Southern diocese were not accepting black students to study for the priesthood.  Most of the young black men who wanted to study for the priesthood were going into religious communities, that is what--and we had one here in Mississippi in Bay St. Louis, the Divine Word Seminary, which was primarily in development of black students for the priesthood.  But they were primarily for the religious community.  They weren't for a diocesan priest.  So, to find a bishop in the South, or even in the North for that matter, to accept a, a black student to (unclear) (study?) (serve?) the priesthood, was, was not ordinary.  So I had to find a, a bishop who would accept me to study for the priesthood.  My pastor at that time was Vincent, Father Vincent Warren, and he knew of a bishop in North Carolina who was a priest, who was a priest with him in Virginia when he was a younger priest.  His name was Vincent Warren, W-A-R-R-E-N.  So he had me to write to Bishop Vincent S. Warren, who was a bishop of the diocesan of Raleigh, North Carolina and ask him if he would accept me as a student.  And right away, but he didn't write me right back to say that he would accept me, but he had a bishop there by--Bishop James Naver (ph.), who was really from Buffalo, New York.  He was a auxiliary bishop, and he kind of encouraged the bishop to contact me.  So the bishop decided to meet with me in Mobile, and he came down, I believe it was in 1950, to Mobile.  He came to, to Mobile to meet with Archbishop Tulan (ph.) at that time.  And he was going to meet with me to interview me to study for his diocese.  And, of course, I was to meet him at the Battle House in Mobile.  It's an old hotel.  It's closed down now.  And I had to tell the bishop that I couldn't meet him at the Battle House because I wasn't allowed in the Battle House.  So I had to tell him, he said, well, meet me at McGill-Tulan High--McGill High School, which was an all-white Catholic high school in Mo--still there.  And so I went to the high school to meet the bishop.  I rode the bus to meet the bishop, but I never found him.  I couldn't find him at all.  And so I got a little disappointed, and I started back home.  I was walking down St. Catherine Street in Mobile towards Spring Hill Avenue, and all of a sudden a car stopped behind me, and a tall, stately--and stately man got out.  And he said, "Are you Mr. Howze?"  I said, "Yes, I am, Father."  He said, "I am Bishop Waters."  And that's the first time we met on the street like that.  So he interviewed me, but he didn't accept me right away because then I went to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I taught high school in Tulsa for a year or two.  But during that time, they did finally accept me to study for the priesthood.  And then I was sent to Buffalo, New York to study at the seminary in Buffalo, just mainly Latin and the languages we were studying.  And I finished that.  Then I went to St. Bonaventure University in Olean, New York to begin my studies, university studies.  And because I had already finished, however, I was able to skip a whole year of just academic work.  And I studied just mainly philosophy for a whole year.  And for that reason, I was able to complete my seminary work in five years instead of six.  And I was ordained in 1959 in Raleigh, North Carolina.  And I said my first, we call a solemn high mass in Mobile, Alabama at Heart of Mary in June--May 10, 1959.  And then I was, went back to North Carolina.  And I was assigned to a parish in Ash--Charlotte, North Carolina.  From Charlotte, I went to Southern Pines, North Carolina.  From Southern Pines, I went to Sanford, North Carolina; from Sanford, I went to Durham, North Carolina.  From Durham, North Carolina, I went to Asheville.  I was in Asheville for nine years.  And that was during Asheville that I was selected to be pope--not pope, to be, selected to be Bishop of the order of Bishop in Mississippi.  And, of course, I was surprised.  I didn't know, why in the world I was to come to Mississippi.
Story_ID: 8563
Speaker 1: One thing you said that intrigued me was that when you first decided to become a priest, there was the dilemma about where you would, how could you serve and, and--so you're saying that (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Most, most dioceses would not acc--bishops would not accept blacks, especially in the South.  None would, none would, not even in Mississippi where I am now, would accept.  But, and the only religious community that was doing it was in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi, however, the Divine Word Fathers.  They would--and most of the young, black priests today are graduates of that school.  And most of the black bishops are graduate of that school too.
Speaker 1: How, what was it like to be a black priest in North Carolina in--?
Speaker 2: I was a, I was a priest in all-black parishes at first.  I was in all--they were all-black parishes.  But when I went to Char--Asheville, I was in an all-black parish there, but then the priest who was in the all-white parish left.  And the bishop asked me if I would become the pastor of that parish.  Now, that was a big decision for me to make and for him too.  But I became the pastor St. Lawrence, which is downtown Asheville, and--.
Speaker 1: And how were accepted?
Speaker 2: Very well, I had no problems, not, not major problems.  I had--.
Speaker 1: What year are we talking about?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty nine [1969].
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine [1969], yeah, that's right on the cusp of the Civil Rights (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Right at it, right at it, yeah.  And I was there for, until I was appointed to come to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: And were there any--you said you had no problems there really in terms of--?
Speaker 2: No problems at, as pastor there, no.  Oh, no, I was, became loved as any pastor would.  I imagine there were some people who were wondering about it the first time.  One of the things we didn't let happen, we didn't let the news media come into the picture.  The bishop asked me not to make any interviews, and I didn't.  And so the first Sunday I was there was September 14, 1969, I remember having no problems.  As a matter of fact, I remember going outside to meet the people, and they said, that we didn't see any difference, you know, they didn't see any--so I was there for four years.  And it, today, they still have a black priest whose pastor there.
Speaker 1: So you were there for four years?
Speaker 2: For four years, before I came to Mississippi.
Speaker 1: I mean, you, so you were--you became a priest in the '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959] I was ordained.
Speaker 1: You were ordained, and--.
Speaker 2: I entered the seminary in 1953.
Speaker 1: It seems like you really moved fast in terms of--.
Speaker 2: It, it, it was.  It was fast movement.  And I wasn't a priest that long before I was made a bishop really.  I was only a priest thirteen years before I was made a bishop.
Speaker 1: Right, a bishop.
Speaker 2: Right, um-hum.
Speaker 1: That's a real (unclear).
Speaker 2: And the interesting thing was to come to Mississippi.  When I received my letter from the Pope that I was to come to Mississippi, I, I wasn't too eager about it because that was right in the civil rights days.  But I came and Bishop Bruneni (ph.) who was my bishop, Joseph Bruneeni, he's deceased now, he received me with open arms, and the people did too.  I have no, had no problems in Mississippi, whatever.  And I traveled all over the state of Mississippi alone, not with a guard, not with anybody.  But, so it was--so I've had a, a pleasant, I would say thirty years.  I've been here thirty years now.  I've had a pleasant thirty years.  And then I became, when I became the bishop and the first bishop of the diocese of Biloxi, that was another challenge.  But it was a pleasant and a very historic and a very enjoyable challenge that I had.
Story_ID: 8564
Speaker 1: So when you were appointed a bishop here in Mississippi, the State of Mississippi, are most of the Catholics in the state in the Gulf or is there--?
Speaker 2: Well, let me put it this way.  Mississippi is more Catholic than North Carolina.  It was at the time.  As far as population, Catholic population, Mississippi had a higher population than the--and, of course, the Southern, the Gulf Coast, certainly was.  I mean because of New Orleans and Mobile and even the black Catholic population was higher.  But, the, I'd say the total population in Mississippi was not that high, I mean cause when you go, to go North, but as I said, I, I have been edified really from the very first day of my appoint, and one of my first assignments as a bishop was to go to Philadelphia, Mississippi to, to confirm.  Now, if you remember, Philadelphia, Mississippi was the place where those three civil rights workers were killed.  And I drove there by myself at evening, at night.
Speaker 1: And this is--we're just talking about five years from--?
Speaker 2: I'm talking about, this is 1973.
Speaker 1: Seventy-three [1973], well, eight years after they were killed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so I drove there alone.  And then in--I confirmed.  In the class, I had Indians, blacks and whites because it's a kind of a, it's a, the Indian reservation is in that area.  So that was my first experience.  So I never had any problem in Mississippi.  I really haven't.  The people have been loyal.  I don't mean just down here, but I mean throughout Mississippi, and I've traveled throughout Mississippi doing all of the confirmations before I even came here in '77 [1977].  And this is my twenty-fifth year being here in this part of Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell me again about you being appointed the Bishop of Biloxi.  How did that (happen?) first, and then--?
Speaker 2: Well, I had some idea about it before it happened, but I didn't exactly know I was gonna be appointed.  But I did know we were trying to divide the State of Mississippi to have a new diocese in this state.  And at that time, Cardinal Law was still a priest, the Bishop of Boston.  He was still a priest in, in Mississippi when I came here.  He was one of the priests.  In fact, he did, he traveled around with me a good bit when he--when I first came.  When I, when I first came to, as I say, well, I first came to Mississippi in 1972 to visit.  I was impressed with Jackson.  I thought Jackson was the cleanest city I'd ever been.  It was clean-looking city.  And when I first got off the plane, I was met by a group of people, both black and white, to greet, welcome me to Mississippi.  That was the, November of 1972.  And we were preparing for my ordination in January of '73 [1973].  So I came back, I moved back to Mississippi in January of 1973, moved from Ashville here.  And, and, of course, my ordination music was planned by a black priest by the name of Clarence Rivers.  He is a priest of Cleveland, Ohio.  And he's still there.  He's a great guy and musician, and musician.  And so he directed the music for my ordination.  It was fantastic.  It was done in the Civic Auditorium in Jackson, a very cold day.  It was freezing cold that day, but it was a, a great occasion because a young black man was being ordained as a, the first auxiliary, the second auxiliary bishop of the State of Mississippi.  The first one was, Bishop Bruneni (ph.) was the first, and I was the second.  And, of course--and I'm quite sure everybody was wondering what was gonna happen.  So was I.  But things really moved along nicely.  I had no problem.  Bishop Bruneni was very good to me.  And he was a Southern bishop himself, a native of Vicksburg, Mississippi.  And coming, coming down here to being a diocese was a challenge because you didn't know what you do, you know.  I didn't have any money, I didn't have anything, but, but again, I would say the people of Mississippi, Biloxi, have been generous and very good.
Story_ID: 8565
Speaker 1: For the record, who is the Pope that--?
Speaker 2: Pope Paul the VI, he appointed me here.  So we've had two Popes since then, Pope John Paul the first, and he died only about a month after he was installed, and this Pope [John Paul II], this Pope I've seen at least seven or eight times.  In fact, when he came to New Orleans, I addressed him New Orleans, and I've seen him a lot of times in Rome.  And, of course, he remembered meeting me in, in Mississippi--in New Orleans when I went to Rome to meet--have my first meeting with him.  That was before he really got sick, like he is now.
Speaker 1: Well, what have been some of the challenges--?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess the challenge was, first place, as I say, you had the money, and we didn't have any money.  And I had work to find money.  And the other challenge is to get your priests to accept you.  You know, most of my priests here were from Ireland.  They weren't American priests, but they were from Ireland and the, and the--I guess the way I got in tune with the Irish priests was I went to Ireland and I visited them, everybody.  So I got to know all of the families in Ireland, and went all, traveled all over.  And so the priests have been very good to me.  The one thing that I didn't have, though, during those years, I never ordained a black priest for the diocese.  I never had a black student for the diocese.  And that always was interesting to me because when I was a--I was trying to find a bishop who would accept me and I would accept priest, any qualified student.  But I never, I never had a black student.
Speaker 1: Well, why do you think that--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It's, in the deep Mississippi, I guess.  Mississippi still has a name outside, you know, of, of--among people because one of the things I would say as a priest, I was also an ambassador for the State of Mississippi as I traveled around because if, you know, I told people I came from Mississippi and I was a priest, a bishop here, it was a, it was a surprise to many people because many people had never seen a black bishop at all, even in the North.  And I said, to see one coming from the South was kind of unusual too.
Speaker 1: Were there any black bishops in the North?
Speaker 2: Not at that time.  I was the second black bishop ordained in the United States of this century.
Speaker 1: Who was the first one?
Speaker 2: Bishop Parry, he's dead now.  He was from Bay St. Louis, and he was a New Orleans priest.  He was (unclear), and he died from (unclear).  He was a (unclear), but he was never head, head of a diocesan.  He was auxiliary of New Orleans.  I was the second to be ordained in the country.  And at that time, there were no other black bishops in the United States except he and myself.  Now, I think they got about twelve, yeah.
Speaker 1: Big difference.
Speaker 2: Improved difference, yeah.  And you got a, quite a number who are heads of diocese since then too, Pensacola has a black bishop, Memphis, Tennessee has one, Lake Charles, Louisiana has one, Beaumont, Texas has one; where's the other one?  Of course, the other one is from Illinois, what's the name of the, Bellevue, Illinois, and he is the head of the bishops' conference right now.  He is, and then--.
Speaker 1: I know who you're talking about.
Speaker 2: His name is Gregory.
Speaker 1: Gregory [Bishop Wilton Gregory].
Speaker 2: But he was, but when--I was a bishop before he was ordained.  I was a bishop, I was a bishop the same year he was ordained a priest, I would put it that way, something like that.  And, but, but at that time, there was Bishop Parry and myself were the only two black priests--black bishops in the United States.
Speaker 1: As a bishop in the state of Mississippi, I mean are blacks--do you think there are, are more black people becoming Catholics in Mississippi?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily.  Not, not necessarily. I don't, I don't think that was, that was ever, if people thought people were gonna jump into Catholic just because you had a black priest or a black bishop, I don't think that was--not, not necessarily.  But I, I think it might improve some relationships, but not necessarily.  But I, I would say there were more black Catholics down here than anywhere else I'd been because of New Orleans and Mobile.  That was the reason, and, but--.
Speaker 1: So, I'm just wondering were there many black Catholic schools down here?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, we--yes and no.  The black Catholic schools throughout the South were made possible because of Mother Drexel.  She became a Saint here, like, Catherine Drexel.  And she's the founder of the Xavier University in New Orleans.  She opened a lot of schools, like the school in here Biloxi was operated first by Mother Catherine Drexel Sisters.  The one in Gulfport too.  The one, we had another one in Pascagoula, black school, it, it wasn't.  But it's still going.  That one's still going.  The one in, here is closed.  The one--all of our black elementary schools have closed.  And, of course, we have the integrated Catholic schools now.  We had one black Catholic high school.  That was Our Mother of Sorrows.  It's closed.  And the only product from that school was the Archbishop of Atlanta that died a few years ago, Bishop Marino, and he, this is his native home.  In fact, his sister still lives here.  I saw her two nights ago.  But that was the, the black, but as I said, the Saint, the Divine Word Seminary has a great history in the development of the black clergy in the United States, a great history.  As a matter of fact, many of the young men who wanted to be priests, way back yonder, when, they were sent to Divine Word Seminary, even though they weren't interested in being a religious priest.  They wanted to be a diocesan priest, work with the bishop.  And some of them became priests, but that's one great history that I had--one thing of history I have in my favor that I was appointed to become bishop of the area, where the Bay St. Louis Seminary is located.  And, and I spent a lot of time there during my years with them, working with them.  Of course, the seminary has--it no longer exists now.  But it's a kind of retirement home for retired priests now.  But the institution is still there, and it has a great history for developing of Catholic clergy, black Catholic clergy in the United States.
Story_ID: 8566
Speaker 1: Now, what was our relationship with Xavier University in Louisiana?
Speaker 2: Well, I was--.
Speaker 1: You have a strong relationship with them?
Speaker 2: --I, I was on the board.  When I was, became a bishop here, I was on the board, trustee board for six years at Xavier.  And, of course, the pres--the man whose the president, Norman Frances, who was a bishop of, of--the brother of Bishop Joseph Frances, who died a few years ago.  He was in Newark, New Jersey.  So I've had that relationship with them.  And, but other than that I have had no, no contact with the school.  But it's really growing and developing.
Speaker 1: And a lot of, I know in the black community--black communities all over the country, people who are really concerned about their children's educations often send their children to--.
Speaker 2: To Xavier.
Speaker 1: --Catholic schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And not just Xavier, but to Catholic schools in the community because they think they can get a better education than in the public schools.  And so, do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Well, that, that's true.  That's true even in Mississippi.  And a lot of the youngsters who went to Catholic schools weren't Catholic.  Their families weren't Catholic, but the black families always admired the, the discipline, the, the, the curriculum and everything in Catholic schools.  And a lot of them went.  As a matter of fact, I'll tell you two of the Supreme Court justices, black Supreme Court justices in Mississippi were all student at Holy Ghost Catholic School in Jackson, Mississippi.  They became Catholics, I think later on, but their families were not Catholic.  And this--the Catholic school was, I will say, was a great factor in many blacks becoming Catholics, not only here, but even in New York City, up in Harlem, New York.  One of the, St. Charles Barmarial (ph.), it's a parish school, was famous for its, it's education and famous for its schools.  And a lot of people, in fact my aunt became a Catholic because she sent her kids to Catholic schools there in New York, in Harlem, New York.  So the Catholic school is a--and education is a very important thing to black families.  I mean what, no matter what people think, it's very important.  And they'll go to all expense to get their children educated if they can.
Story_ID: 8567
Speaker 1: In this community with so many black Catholics, are there any particular--I mean, what--political challenges in dealing with the Catholic church in general?
Speaker 2: No, I don't think there were particular political challenges, nah.  I don't, I don't recover any.  But here again, I think some of the young blacks in this community who may be in active in politics, were once students in the Catholic school, even though they might not have been Catholic.
Speaker 1: I know in black Catholics, black Presbyterians--.
Speaker 2: Even Methodists--.
Speaker 1: --Episcopalians.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Episcopalians, right.
Speaker 1: There seems to be, there's been a movement since the late '60s [1960s] (unclear) schools, and for want of a better word, lack of an adequate church (unclear) or maybe more compatible with black people--.
Speaker 2: Okay, and that's a good point.  Yeah, that's a good point.  Even in the Catholic church, since the Second Vatican Council, when the, the liturgy was made available, both vernacular language for people, I mean in the language that people spoke, and the structure was, the liturgy was structured a little different.  For instance, yeah, I've gone to some Catholic liturgies, I'll tell you the truth, I didn't know in the first part of it, if it was Catholic or not, I mean the way it was structured.  And it's okay.  I mean the spirituals, the gospels, every, every Catholic church has a gospel choir now, I mean black.  You go--we have one in, in Bay St. Louis called Saint--what?  St. Rose of Lima.  They have a famous Baptist--not Baptist, famous Catholic choir, gospel choir there, that's famous all over the coast here.  And it is really, it is really traditionally a black congregation singing it.  And, and that has been made possible because of the structure of the liturgy, not only for blacks, but for other groups to add national groups.  The Vietnamese, much of their liturgy, it's not, it's Catholic, but a lot of it has Vietnamese culture in it.  However, I, I'll take that back, even--it depends.  Even in Africa, though, some of the, the liturgies are very Roman.  They're not, they're not local, but, but I would say sometimes, the Americans picked up the, the African style some times better than some of the African, which--.
Speaker 1: And it seems to be a phenomenon, you know, that Africans--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on the continent or from the continent tend to be--.
Speaker 2: Very conservative.
Speaker 1: -- yeah, more European than (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Very conservative, the bishops are very conservative.  Very Roman, we would say.
Speaker 1: Right, where the African Americans tend to want to be more African.
Speaker 2: Of, of a type, yeah.
Speaker 1: Of a, yeah, of a type.  (Unclear) I don't, you know if you--(unclear).
Speaker 2: But, but that's a good point you made that, that I would say, I know in the Catholic church, that there is a, a great effort to, to emphasize the culture of the Africans in the church liturgy, not to change it, but to enhance it.  And, and the mus--and as you know, the music is, is one where, we've all been good at music.  We all have choirs and things like that.  So it, it, it's good.  And it's, it's not anti-Catholic to do it.  I mean the church has always said that, and many popes, Pope Pius, the Twelfth, was particularly of making the liturgy as locally, to the local culture as well to the European church, you  know.  And it's been an effort to do that, without destroying it, without it being Catholic--without trying to not have it Catholic, but to have it, to have it localized with a national culture, whatever that is.  And you made the point, if a--that, you said, to blacken it or whatever the case, there, there is an effort to do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know there are black organizations today of the major denominations of unions or like there's a Union of Black Episcopalians--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --there's a Catholic (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: And it's, it's, it--it's good, and because as the bishop of the diocese of Biloxi, I had a lot of Vietnamese here that I assist.  And most of the Vietnamese are Catholics, (a few?) (unclear) a number of Buddhists, but mostly Catholic.  And they are very good, active Catholics.  When I would go around to celebrate a liturgy in the Vietnamese, for the Vietnamese, I would do my part in English, but I'd let them do their part in Vietnamese.  And, and so that's the way we developed it.  And, and it's--the English, I, for instance, I could say the "Lord's Prayers" two times while they're finishing their one time in Vietnamese, yeah.  But, we, we, you develop it.  And that was one thing about my being a bishop down here.  I was a bishop for, for a really, I would say a cosmos of the universe.  I had all races down here, Indian, black, white, red, brown, a lot of Hispanic people too.
Story_ID: 8568
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the congregation in [Washington] D.C. that defected basically from the Catholic church under George [A.] Stallings Yeah, yeah, George started that.  I haven't heard a whole lot about George in recent years, though, so.
Speaker 2: But you knew him in--?
Speaker 1: I knew him as a youngster, as a small kid, grade--in grade school.  And as I said, a very smart young man.  He really is, a very intelligent young man.  And, and Bishop, Cardinal Hickey was his seminary professor in Rome [Italy], when he was a student there.  So Cardinal knew him too, quite well.  But his parents are still active Catholics in Newbern, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, do you think it--what do you think about that, about churches (unclear) defecting like that?
Speaker 1: Well, as I say, I wished he could have not done that.  I--because he was a smart young man, and he was, was gonna do well in the church.  He really was.  And, and I, I think pride can make you, most, do most anything if it gets in your way, and I think that was his problem.  And I--it'll be good if he could come back to the church.  Now, that wouldn't, it wouldn't--it's not unheard of that he could come back to the church.
Speaker 2: Do you think they would let him back?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, if he would, if he would make the approach, proper approach, he could get back in the church, yeah.  Now, some other, some other things would have to be reorganized in his life, but he, I mean he could return to the church.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it--therein, I think lies a dilemma of (unclear) black parishioners in different denominations that (unclear) political, that are run politically by black people, and I think they feel, a lot of them think, the organizations were formed for their own protection within that denomination, but then the challenge is how black or how politically black can they be, culturally or politically, without actually leaving.
Speaker 1: Well, I, I do think that there's room for any group to have its native clergy if possible because they can stand, to understand and to work with.  But also, I don't think it's impossible for anybody to work with any group if you, if you develop it (unclear) or not, because, let's say, all of the, even all of the early missionaries who went to Africa were white.  So I mean, I'm quite sure they were adaptable to (unclear) in the local culture.  Sometimes, they became maybe more black, than the blacks did sometimes.  And that happens, even sometimes, even with priests sometimes.
Story_ID: 8569
Speaker 1: The missionaries who went to Zululand, becoming more Zulu than the real ones.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and there are some black--white priests, sometimes who work in black parishes, who really they blacken themselves more than the local community a little bit.
Speaker 1: Father [Michael L.] Pfleger in Chicago has a reputation for (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: I know, I know Father Pfleger, yeah, I know of him.  But, and it's okay.  It's okay as long as, as people are oriented for the love of God and the love of neighbor for the benefit of everybody.  But I imagine years ago--for instance, I will take Buffalo, New York as an example.  When I was a young student in Buffalo, there were only two black priests in the whole city of Buffalo.  One was Father William Grau, G-R-A-U, who had to go to Europe to be educated and ordained, but this was in Buffalo.  He became a priest in Buffalo.  Then the other one was Father, Father Peter Carter, who was natively from Tuskegee, Alabama.  But he became a priest--oh, he's dead now, and they were the only two priests.  Now, in December--in January, I'm going to Buffalo to, on [Dr.] Martin Luther King's celebration, and one of the reasons I'm going is because they have a Office of Black Catholic Cler--Catholics.  And then this young woman asked me to come up to--but I remembered as a student in Buffalo, I didn't see that many black Catholics in Buffalo, even when I was a student.  And, and, and they were, they were in kind of black parishes, even in Buffalo, New York.  I mean they weren't intentionally black, but they were in the black community like.  So, but there is a struggle even there to, to make the black Catholics a part of the diocese of Buffalo, and the bish--and the local bishop is working with it, and everybody else.  And all of them have been working with it.  But it's, I said, when I was a student at St. Bonaventure, I was the only black student in the whole school, in the seminary.  Now, there are a few more because I was there, see, and there were a couple of more.  But, but there--but it wasn't unusual.  I enjoyed myself, I had not problems as the only student.
Speaker 1: Thinking about black organizations in the Catholic church.  Do you know anything about the Knights of Peter Claver?
Speaker 2: Yes, they, that group was begun in Mobile, Alabama, around 1909 by the Josephites and a, a young man who his family still lives in Mobile, some of them.  And they were started primarily as, not to counter, but as a substitute in the community for Knights of Columbus.  So, so they became very active, but I will say this.  Now, when I was in North Carolina, my bishop would not want the, Peter Claver to come into his diocese because he was trying to integrate the Knights of Columbus.  And he thought if he had another group to come in, that he wouldn't ever be able to--and I was made a Knight of Columbus in North Carolina.  But I--also a Peter Claver though, a member of Peter Claver also.
Speaker 1: Now, who was Peter Claver again?
Speaker 2: Peter Claver was a Jesuit who administered to the slaves, the boat people who were being brought from Africa to the United States as slaves.  And he was a great minister to those people.  And, of course, today a lot of black parishes were named St. Peter Claver parishes.  If it was St. Peter Claver, I knew it's in a black community (laughs) because it's, that's the name of, of the organization.  But it, it's a great, and, and the St. Peter Claver organization has grown tremendously.  It's a great organization, primarily headquartered in New Orleans.
Speaker 1: Now, there's a, there's an ancient kind of a history of black people being high figures in the Catholic church that a lot of people don't know about.  And I remember years ago I was told by an associate that we had the first black saint, was, you know, (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: St. Martin de Porres--
Speaker 1: You know, but there--but this was someone who just, was made a Saint in the 1970s, and I was telling the person, said, no, no, what about St. Maurice and what about, you know, there are other, there were other black saints.
Speaker 2: Well, there was, there was probably an earlier black Saint called Benedict the Moor.  And he was a Franciscan, but the one you're talking about, Martin de Porres, he was a Dominican friar.  He was Dominican brother.  He was really from Peru.  His mother was a black woman and his daddy was a Peruvian, and of his, (unclear) mulatto.  So he became a famous brother and a famous saint.  As, as a fact, the devotion to Martin de Porres is great in Mexico.  It's funny, but you go to Mexico, and everybody's house has a St. Martin de Porres statute in it.  And you're right.  He, I forget what Pope canonized Martin de Porres, but now he is Saint Martin de Porres, but when I was ordained, he was Blessed Martin de Porres, beatified.
Story_ID: 8570
Speaker 1: There seems to be, especially in the last, I mean six months, there's been a lot of attention given the Catholic church, negative attention around--.
Speaker 2: Scandal.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the scandal.  And do you have a take on that at all?  Or do you or that's not for you to say (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Well, certainly, that's an unfortunate thing to have happened.  And if it does it happen, I mean it, it's unfortunate.  (Unclear) I was at the bishops conference this week, our (unclear) and working with that problem.  And I don't think it should ever have happened, but--and I, I also read today in a place that it is--the Catholic church gets more publicity about something like that than the groups, but it also happens in other groups too.  But I, I think it's a sad fact if a clergyman of any type is taking advantage of a kid or anybody.  And it's just a sad fact.  And, and that was--I won't say blown out of proportion, but it, it was a troublesome thing.  It was trouble--troublesome to good priests who act, who are so good and who give no problems.  Some, some guys stopped wearing the collar at all.  They didn't, cause they didn't want to be--I, I mean the good ones, just wouldn't wear it in public.  And this is bad, this is bad.  And I would say, it's not the worse thing that the church has ever--the church has gone through many, many struggles.  And the church will go through this, and will come out, I'm quite sure, purified, if we might use that term.  But I think whatever happened, this year has put bishops on spot to, to seek, correct any abuses if there were abuses in the--and I'm quite sure there were.
Speaker 1: And do you have any opinion about Cardinal [Bernard] Law handled the situation?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, as I told you, I've known Cardinal Law before he became Cardinal Law, before he was even a bishop I knew him.  As a matter of fact, I was there in Boston in February to do Black History week for Cardinal Law.  And I lived his house with--right across the hall from his hall.  It's just unfortunate that he had to endure this.  I mean I'm quite sure that whatever was happening before he got there.  And, and it, and it seemed to have happened at a time when things, I wouldn't say was seeming slack, but, you know, after the Second Vatican Council, there was a lot of experimentation in--not, not immoral things, but experimentation in the church liturgy and everything.  And there was a little laxity, in a sense, maybe about some things.  And it seems that these, these cases that happened, happened during that time.  And I don't think they're happening now.  That's what I'm saying; it happened during that time.  Yeah, well, I know Cardinal Law, and I, I sympathize with him even having to struggle.  And it's, it's just boomeranged, you know, after that.  But I was there in February with him.
Speaker 1: And it seems as though the more he tried to keep a lid on it, the worse it got, the more pressure built up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and in years past--I know a (unclear) bishop has got, got a lot of criticism with this.  In years past, if a guy was, had problems, such as alcohol or whatever, and there were men with alcohol problems, well, we sent them to these treatment places.  And they would send you a report back that this guy was okay.  He could be put back into ministry with a certain--.  And the bishops did do it.  And, of course, now, they know they shouldn't have, in some cases, they shouldn't have ever.  And they won't, but, but I, I think they did it in good faith.  They weren't being evil or, or vicious just because moving a guy around from one parish to the other, I mean, because the church also has a, has a philosophy of theology of reconciliation that people do change, that, that even sinner change, that we're supposed to change.  We're supposed to want to change anyway.  But I think with all of the idea of, of the psychic, psychology and psychiatry and everything else that's dealing with human nature, I think we have to recognize that, that grace builds on nature.  In other words, if the nature is out of line, it ain't gonna be worked, yeah, so.  I, I'm hoping that, that, and praying too, that in the future, this, that this is something of the past.  As I said, if you church--study church history, there are other things back in church history that would have been troublesome too.  But not as quickly publicized as it is now.  You have Internet, you have television, you have fax machines, you have everything that things are put across its quickest.  And you mail a letter from here to Europe, it's takes you about four days to--but if you put it on the Internet, they get it in a second.  So, there is a difference.  I, I did some shopping when I was in Rome, and I went and used my credit card.  I gave the guy my credit card.  He put it through, and it went just like that.  I said, gee whiz, I can't believe that it approved like that.  I've had sometimes in the United States, you got time getting it approved.  But to show you how technology has made it possible for us to know things a whole lot faster than we used to know them.

Speaker 1: What is, being in this, in the Gulf area, there is--I know black people in the Gulf and maybe some others, have engaged in a practice that involve the Catholic church, but not, are not of the Catholic church.  There are a lot of, their belief systems and superstitions and other things, I guess, that people have called various things from (unclear) gris-gris or hoodoo or voodoo and, you know--,
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You know, what is that's been all, it's closely associated with the Catholic church--.
Speaker 2: Sometimes it is, because as I said before, when the church has gone to these places to evangelize people, they have sometimes tried to incorporate that which is Christian with which is the present.  And, of course, many of the celebrations we have today, for instance, let's take Halloween as an example.  Halloween is really the eve of the hallowed, the eve of the saints.  It was supposed to be something of that nature, but it has really changed its structure of, of a lot of ways.  For instance, I heard the other day, why jack-o-lanterns were a part of Halloween, was that in Ireland, they had the idea that there was man once who was rejected by both God and the devil at, at the same time--can you believe that rejection?  And one of the things that he had to carry a lantern with him everywhere he went.  So this is the idea how jack-o-lanterns got into the idea of Halloween.  But to get the other one, Halloween was really the eve of the feast of All Saints, a great feast day, celebrating the sainthood of everybody because there are many saints who are not canonized by the Catholic church, but they're still saints.  And so the church has its feast of celebrating that.  But you get a feast like Halloween which is really agonized, the whole celebration and it's, it's not what it used to be.  So, getting back to your point, there might be some things like the voodoo, things like that, that--in areas where that, that the priest might have in the early days, tried to work with that, without destroying it exactly, to enhancing it, for instance--not to enhance it, but to, to give it some kind of Christian identity.  But now, as I say, voodooism is not Catholic, but it, it could be like in the Haitian, in Haiti, you know, you might find some of this.  And you'll find that the people in Haiti who might be in voodooism, are Catholics.  And so they might mix it up a little bit, not with, not with the blessing of the church, but with the tolerance of the church sometimes.  So it, it might be that, in that case.  But I think superstition is a, is an area through human nature.  I don't think it's just Catholic.  I think, I think you'd find a little bit everywhere, people being superstitious about some things, whether it's a black cat or what or whatever.

Speaker 1: What's the best thing about being a Catholic today?  I mean you made a conversion--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as I say it, I have great respect for all people of any denomination.  I have great respect for--it's a fact, most of my family are still Baptists and Methodists, and since we all love each other to death, we have no--it's not problem of my being a Catholic and being (unclear).  We love each other to death.  And, and, of course, with the Second Vatican Council, the council did recognize that all Christian religions have some basis.  I mean we, we all believe in Jesus Christ.  We believe in baptism.  As a matter of fact, in years gone by, if a convert became, from another church, Christian church to the Catholic church, you had to baptize them again conditionally.  Today we don't do that.  So if a person who's coming from the Baptist church become Catholic, all they have to do is make a profession of faith.  They don't have to be re-baptized because we see that once bap--baptized, you're baptized forever, because the only thing that's necessary for baptism is to believe that we're being baptized in the name of the Father, Son and the Holy Spirit.  So anybody can baptize.  Even an unbeliever could baptize me if, or somebody if I wanted them to perform the ceremony.  So baptism is so important to all of Christian religion that it's so basic, that, so, that the Baptists and the Catholics and all Christians have some identity.  There are, some things are different about it, but sometimes there are more things that are common than there are different about it.  So I don't think--I think that we need to respect--it's bad when you get a Christian, whether they're Protestant or not, who are downing another religion just because they're different.  I think we all can do very well, if, if you're a good Baptist, okay, good Baptist; you're a good Catholic, be a good Catholic, be a good Christian, but being a good Christian is the love of God, the love of neighbors, the love of self, which is the most difficult commandment for us to, to practice, to really--and all of the other commandments depend on these two commandments.  So that's very important.  That's the reason different Christian, different religions can work together.  If we don't work together in worship service, we can work together in human relation things, which are also connected with religion, very much so.  And so today, we do that.  You find a lot.  But here in, in Biloxi, every, every Lenten season, I always did a service in the Episcopal church room, always did, have done it for years.  I guess they might be still doing it.  One of, when I first came to here as bishop, one of my first invitations from anybody was from a rabbi, so I spent my first evening in a, in a Jewish ceremony.  I remember I have a red skull cap that the bishops wear.  And I asked the, the rabbi said, you can wear your skull cap.  No, I said, I want to wear yours.  So I put on his black, (unclear) kind of that the, that the men wear at Jewish-- so, I, I mean that.  And when he died, I was at his funeral as a bishop, a Catholic bishop.  And I participated.  I remember when we buried him, and they threw dirt on his casket, they asked me also to throw some.  So, as I said, we, we're--and Jesus Christ was Jewish himself.
Speaker 1: Well, things have changed a lot, and the continue to change--.
Speaker 2: And they have to, they need to change as far as--not, not change so, so that the, that the Baptist will deny what he believes or the Christ--Catholic will deny, but change so that we get along to some extent, that we're united.  As I say, our baptism makes us all one, and, and that's very true since the Second Vatican Council.  When I received, if the people were Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, I didn't re-baptize them.  I just, they just made a profession of faith and they were members of the Catholic church, just like that.
Speaker 1: Can you foresee a time when the need for denominations will, won't exist?
Speaker 2: I don't exactly see it because of human nature is so different.  And they're so, things that make us so different to--I think that there can be a time when more people become, can become one group, but I don't think it will destroy.  I don't think you will (unclear) ever by being, having Baptists, Southern Baptists, American Baptists, or Roman Catholics, or Methodists or whatever.  I think they will always be there.  But they're Christians.  That's the point, the key.  Now, it would be good if we all could be one, and we want to be one, but I, I personally, and that's a personal opinion, I don't think we're gonna--I know you won't see it in my time (laughs).
Speaker 1: I know the Pope got into some trouble last year in the news for saying that the Catholics were number one or something (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, the Catholic church is the oldest denomination, we, we put it that--the Catholic church.  All of the other churches have pulled--have grown from it, the Lutheran church, and the Baptist, all of them have grown out of--but they all have some similarities.  For instance, in the Methodist church, they say the Apostles Creed just like we do, see.  So there, there're some of the (unclear)--the, in the Episcopal church, they say the Nicene Creed, sounds just like it.  I've gone to a Lutheran church, the Lutheran liturgy is, the first part is just, very Catholic-looking to me.  So there it is that, the unity, but as I say, that what started it and broke it apart, will take a lot to put together.  But I do think there's opportunity for them to come--and they will groups.  I mean not too long ago in an Episcopal group became Catholic out in Dallas, Texas, and Fort Worth, Texas, the whole group came into the Catholic church.  So it is possible, and, but I think it's just possible for us to love one another as best we can in what we're doing, and work with one another.

Speaker 1: Now, what are your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: This is outside the Catholic church, outside of talking about the Catholic--one of my hopes is that we can stop drugs from coming into the black community because the drugs are destroying our young black men.  I read somewhere recently that there are more young, black men in prisons and in jails than there are in college and universities.  That's a bad sound to me.  And, of course, once they get there, they are called felons, they are a guilty of a felony, and that, usually they get out, they can't vote.  They can't take in the political system.  And that's a sad commentary.  I think, I--the, the drugs in the black community, and, you know, from Chicago, but they're all over, is, is a devastating thing.  And I think we need to--that's what we need to work on.  I think that's the beginning of a lot of our problems.  And I have in my own family, and I can--it's everybody have, have it structured to have some with (unclear) the drugs.  The other one would be that, education.  I, I think it's very important that--and we talked about that as, as young black families wanting their children education.  I think you still do--we still do, but I think it's a very important--and I don't mean educated just for money, to make more money.  I mean educated to have better value systems, to have a better union with families.  That would be my idea.  I don't think that we've made the progress in education since the Supreme Court decision that I dreamed that we would have made.  I don't think we've made it.  As, as I said when, and you tell me that there are more kids, more young black men in prison than in jails than they're in colleges and universities, I think it's a sad commentary.  I don't think we got--and you go to most, you can go to a state that has a small black population, like, let's say Arizona, and you go in the prison, the bulk of the prisoners are black.  I wonder why?  It bothers me.  And this is true everywhere.
Story_ID: 8574
Speaker 1: Do you think that the Church has a responsibility for social change, you know?
Speaker 2: It has, but it has to change the attitudes of people, if that's possible.  I think social change is still a political issue a lot of times with, but I think the church, the attitudes that people have (unclear), because laws do not necessarily make people better, but it's the attitudes that help people to, to adapt to that.  And, and I, and I think that's a basis for [Dr.] Martin Luther King's [Jr.] involvement in the Civil Rights Movement and all of the rest.  I mean his, his--is the attitude of changing attitudes rather than structures, necessarily.  If the attitudes are strengthened, the structures you can develop.
Speaker 1: Well, King did challenge the structures?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, he did, yeah.
Speaker 1: And he went right to the source of the problem.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did.  And you had, as I said, in the early days, you had black priests, black nuns, and these are the days when nuns were still wearing identifiable habits, and you can see them in the march, and, if--now, you wouldn't know one from the other because they don't wear all the identifiable habits, but in those days you did.  You could identify people.  So it, but I think that would be the attitude.  I, I still think it takes politics to change things, I think, I think.  I mean the civil rights, the laws of the civil rights had to be made by the government.  But I think, I think the attitudes of people can enhance it--be enhanced by their religious belief of that, all people are created in the image of God.

Speaker 1: Your legacy.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think that I've been blessed in a great sense as to be a convert to the Catholic church as I have in a few years and to have achieved, with the help of a lot of people, what I have achieved, that is, to be the founding bishop of a new diocese in South Mississippi.  I think I'm very happy about that because as a young priest, if you had told me or if anybody had said to me, you're gonna go to Mississippi.  I would have said, are you crazy? (laughs) I mean in the days of civil rights.  I wouldn't have wanted to come here.  I really wouldn't.  And as I said, when I was sent here, of course, my bishop helped me in, to develop an attitude about it, Bishop Bagley.  He said, go, you are going for the universal church.  You will help.  And I, I feel good that I've been able to do that.  And I, I think that will be my legacy.  In other words, no, I haven't done anything any greater than any other bishop, any other place.  I haven't done anything any greater than the white bishop who would start a new diocese and there are many, many bishops, white bishops, who have started new dioceses.  But I think of the circumstances of the things that happened and the things of where I worked, makes the difference, and I'm happy about that.
Speaker 1: And this is slightly different, but how would like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a bishop who served as a pastor to the people, rather than a great, just an administrator.  And that's what I've tried to do personally in my life here as, as both--I had to administrate, had to do things that you had to do.  You had to keep records.  You had to be worrying about finances, but I also liked the idea--I used to like to try to know everybody in the diocese.  I, and now, I know families, and I know their children's names, and, and I do try to find this out about people and associate.  I got a letter from a young man today that I helped way back many years ago.  And I wrote him about that I passed a place the other day, and I thought about his dad, where he worked.  And that was a long time ago.  He wrote me back, and he said, "you never forget anything about my family."  And I don't.  Not only his, but most families, I don't, and I try, so I, that's the way I would love to be remembered because I think that's the greatest idea of service, to be, of service to be, and I say, be a pastor to people.
