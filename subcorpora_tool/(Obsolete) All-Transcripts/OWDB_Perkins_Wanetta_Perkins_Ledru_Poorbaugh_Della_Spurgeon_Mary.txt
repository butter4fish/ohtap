 Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  So what   s your name  laughter ?  Oh my sakes  Wanetta Shepard Perkins. I was born in Arnold, Kansas April  24, 1919.  We won   t do the whole thing over again, but we need you to state your name  and where and when you were born.  I   m Della Easton Poorbaugh. I was born February 4, 1913.  Mary Johnson Spurgeon. I was born February 15, 1918 near Ensign, Kansas.  Ledru Perkins, and I was born July 7, 1918.  All right, let   s get right to the deflating the cows story  laughter . That was  the wildest part. Could you just go ahead and talk in your own words about  what would happen?  Go ahead Mary, and I   ll help you out.  During the dirty thirties, we herded cows on any unused grass or draws or  adjoining farmland. There wasn   t much for the cows to eat. Mainly, it was  just bare ground. The cows would eat anything they could find that was green,  and often on the way home from herding cattle all day, our cows would find  some green little Russian thistles. By the time I got home with the cows,  often, we had to get the butcher knife and stick the cow and let the pressure off  of her stomach.  That knife was called a trocar.  Yes, well there were trocars, but that was the fancy name. We just used a  butcher knife.  How far in would you put the knife?  It didn   t matter. The stomach   s pretty big.  5  L. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Kite  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  Far enough to get into that strip of air.  Where on the cow would you poke it?  Between the hip bone and the short ribs there   s a triangle that would puff up,  and when you stuck it, then the pressure would go off and the cow could live.  And you said you could actually hear it.  You can just hear it whistle. It just tttsssss.  What were you saying? You had a cow that had been stuck so many times.  Yes, but she didn   t heal up completely, so she had a hole that was always open  in her stomach. When she would trot, often, the stomach contents would jump  up and come out of her stomach.  A cocklebur. If they were eating along, and a cocklebur just has two little  leaves on it when it comes through the ground. All they have to do is nip that,  and they   re dead ducks.  It would kill?  Oh yes, it was poison.  It   ll get them immediately. They may just be eating along, and they don   t  intend to eat this, but they just happen to get a taste of it, and it gets them.  It   ll kill a hog just as quick.  The cows wouldn   t have any instinct to not eat that, is that right?  They didn   t intend to eat it, but once in a while, they were trying to get  something to eat, and they   d just accidentally bite it, and when they did, that  was too bad.  Johnsongrass was real bad.  The horse would eat the Locoweed, and they   d be loco too.  I thought that was just on movies.  No, it   s real.  What would the animals do if they ate Locoweed?  They   d become addicted to it, just like a dope fiend. They   d lose their  judgement, and they   d be dangerous really.  6  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  You see some of it out in the pastures occasionally now.  They   d hunt that stuff up.  Really? They would crave it?  Yes, just like marajuana.  Yes, because it greens up before the grass does. That   s how they get started  eating it, because it   s green.  But they   re sillier than all else when they start eating that.  Did you ever try some of it yourself?  All say no.   We had better sense, didn   t we.  Well, the horses didn   t intend to eat it, but he got the first bite and just kept on.  Well what did you think of the government programs that came in? You  mentioned shooting the cattle, and you got ten dollars a head for that, and that  was all right with you guys?  It wasn   t all right. There was no other way to go. We were out of grass; we  were out of feed.  They were starving to death, so ten dollars beat nothing.  You couldn   t sell a one, because there was no market.  We weren   t in that program.  It wasn   t the best meat, but it was eatable. You could can it, and it made a  pretty good meal.  You   d have to chew it a lot of times  laughter    I go by that canyon over there where they put those cows, and I can see those  cows stacked up there yet, every once in a while, and I think about that, and I  think, oh my.  How tall a stack was it after they were done?  Oh, they just had this canyon full of them. They just took them out there and  shot them, not too far from us, west down there on that place of Leonard  Bailey   s. They took them up there in that canyon.  Oh, where Perry and Cecil Mull lived?  7  W. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Poorbaugh  Kite  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Owen Hendrix lived in that house at that time, and they would let you bring  your cookers if you wanted to, just go in the house and go out and get all the  meat you wanted and take it in there and cook it and can it.  But your family never did that.  No. We herded our cattle and kept them, because that was all we had to live  on. My father was a well driller, but nobody had any money to pay him. He  repaired wells and all that. And the wheat, you   d plant your wheat crop. He  had bought an International truck just before the hard times hit, and by the  time the hard times were over, he owed more on his truck than he had in the  beginning, because of the interest, but then the gasoline to plant the crops and  all that, and then it would blow out, or there wouldn   t be enough moisture to  raise a crop, so we were very poor. My mother raised chickens, and she  dressed them and made cottage cheese from the cow milk and took it to the  Farmer   s Market, the Home Demonstration Market in Dodge City, and that   s  the way she bought our groceries. Then my father took in some money from  his well work, but we didn   t get much out of our crops for years.  Did you work in any other government program at all, any    New Deal     programs or WPA?  When I went to college at Dodge City, they had a new junior college there, so  my mother worked it out so we could go to the college there, and my sister and  I worked for the NYA, I believe it was called, and we earned  10 a week, and  that   s how we could afford to go to college.  What did you do to earn the  10?  I worked for an art teacher, which was nice.  Do you think that started your interest in art?  No, I had been interested before that.  Mrs. Poorbaugh, do you remember any government programs or any work  relief programs?  Oh, in the sewing room. The government had sewing rooms. We made shirts.  I worked in a sewing room.  How much did you get paid to sew?  What   d we get? Did we get a dollar?  I don   t know what that ran at.  I think we just got a dollar a day, and we   d sew shirts. And we took our own  sewing machine. We   d sew all day, and I think we just got a dollar.  8  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Did you make matresses?  No.  There was a government program, where they could go and make matresses,  and my family, my mother and sisters, did that.  We separated cream. I was the motor on the churn. I churned butter for my  mother to sell, fifty cents a pound.  Do you remember having to wear any of the government clothing? Did you  wear any of the things you made?  No, I don   t know that I did.  No, we never heard of that.  I don   t know that we wore, but they did, they issued it out. We didn   t have  much, but we didn   t have that  laughter    Well, ( ) worked on the WPA with a four-horse Fresno and worked on the  roads and built ponds.  On the WPA?  Yeah.  Did any of your husbands or fathers work on the WPA, the road programs?  My husband said the schoolhouse was a WPA project.  You were talking about cars a while ago. In 1929, we were at Englewood up  there, and we had a good wheat crop, so my dad jumped out and bought a new  Chevrolet car, I think  700. We could not pay for that car  laughter   We lost  it, and we moved back down here then. The fellow that bought it had it for a  year or two, and he told Daddy he could buy it back. We still didn   t have a  decent car, so we bought it back for  400 the next time, and we still couldn   t  pay for that car  laughter . So we ended up with a team of horses and a trailer.  It was kind of a let down. Then my grandmother Shepherd though, had an old  Model-T that she got a hold of somewhere, and that long hill up there by J.S.  Dillon   s Ranch, we   d get half way up that hill, and it was so steep that the  clutch band would get hot and you would have to turn the car around and  finish backing up the hill. I was mortified to go into Englewood with that old  Model-T after having that new Chevrolet car, so I told my dad to let me out by  the Christian church up there and I   d walk in, and he said,    You   re going to  ride in, same as me       Laughter   My husband   s brothers worked for the CCC camp out in California, I believe it  was.  9  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Kite  Poorbaugh  They were active in Oklahoma too, the CCC camps. In Boise City, they have  an outhouse built by the CCC.  I   ve seen that.  They were good-looking outhouses. Did they ever come through here building  those?  I don   t know if they did or not.  There were several outhouses built by the government, yes.  They put them at the parks and all that stuff, but I don   t know.  There are two right up here at the park, what   s left of them.  They were double seaters.  Yeah. Doesn   t Golda Shepard   s place up there; I think they had one of those,  didn   t they? I   m not sure.  No, the only two that I know of are right up there at the park.  It was a government job anyway when they built them with cement.  I talked to a lady that said she had a four-holer because of her four kids. The  Dad said to heck with this. He made a big one, and they   d just all go out there  at the same time. They were all about the same age  laughter . I don   t think I  would have liked that. Well is there anything else you lost during the dust  bowl and the Depression? She lost her car.  Oh, we could not pay for that car.  I lost my piano. My mother had bought a new piano for me, and then there  was a day when my father said we couldn   t keep up the payment on it, so it  went back to the shop. I remember, we went back and looked at it in the music  store one day, and this fellow was trying to sell it to us. He said that it hadn   t  had a decent tune played on it, that it was just like new  laughter    I know one time we started to town, and we didn   t have any gas in that car to  speak of, and we coasted down the hill, and Alan didn   t think we could make it  up the other, but the wind was blowing so hard we opened both doors,   laughter  and we made it to the top of the hill and over.  Well that   s a time when the wind was a good thing. Well what about cars? Do  you remember when you had your first car? Do you remember your first car  ride?  No. I remember my grandpa bought a new Model-T at that time, earlier. I  10  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  think it was about 1920,    21, and it was brand new. It was a touring car, and  he took us riding in that new touring car. It was really something for us.  I would think if you   ve never been in a car before, it would be scary the first  time.  I can   t remember. My father always had old cars. He had an Overland and a  Buick and Essex and Willies Knight. I don   t know what else, but when we  went to school, we went with the horse and buggy out in the country school.  And then Mabel, my oldest sister, rode to high school on her horse. It was  four and a half miles to Ensign, Kansas.  We lived west of Englewood there. I walked back. Out on Theis Ranch, I had  to walk to school. It was two and a half miles. Then after I moved to the Ab  Akins place I rode a horse to Excelsior Country School.  Well my dad bought a car, a great big old thing, before I was born. He never  had driven a car. He didn   t know what it was. He was going to learn. He got  out there and ran over a cow, so he sold the car  laughter    Ledru   s grandfather was a doctor, wasn   t he Dr. E.B. Strong? And he  delivered Bill   s mother, Viola Taylor Spurgeon, when she was born.  Yep.  What a tight community.  It was in the diary that Bill   s granddaddy, Viola   s parent, had written. He said  that; what was your grandfather   s name?  Dr. E.B. Strong.  Yeah, he lived on Horse Creek, and Nelson Taylor said he went over and got  Dr. Strong and he delivered the baby. It was Viola.  When my dad had pneumonia, we went down and got Dr. Dugan. He lived  about two and a half miles from us. You might have to get him out of the  corral, he might have been milking cows, but he did come and doctor him.  Well what other luxuries do you remember having for the first time? Do you  remember when you first got electricty or first saw electricity?  We never did.  We had a wind charger, and we had batteries. The wind charger would build  up the batteries until we had electricity in the house.  After I started teaching, I bought a wind charger and a battery and radio for my  father, because he liked to listen to the news on the radio.  11  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Kite  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Poorbaugh  Kite  We had something that you haven   t asked about   we had a rabbit drive, jack  rabbits. Were you in on that? They just fixed a big fence just like the back of  a baseball, your screen, and the neighbors, I don   t know how many hundred  people there were. They were just scattered out all over the country just arm to  arm with clubs. In these pastures, we   d shooed these rabbits in this pen and  knocked them in the head with ball bats.  How many rabbits did they kill that day?  I don   t remember.  I think it was 5,000.  Oh, it was a big bunch of them. They were just taking the country.  They were gathered up and sent in and made tankage out of it.  I didn   t remember what they did with them.  Do you know what tankage is?  No.  Hog feed  laughing .  You know what tankage is. It was a food that they made that they fed the  dogs. They fed it to dogs.  Those old long-eared jack rabbits, and they   d get up there and study just what  they were going to do to get out of there, but they had just enough people to  keep them from getting away.  Were you on the rabbit drive?  Oh yeah.  Was it entertainment for you, or was it something that was fun?  Well, it was something that we needed to do to get grass for the cattle. The  rabbits were eating it.  There were too many rabbits.  It sounds like it.  The rabbits were so thick, and they   d eat the grass or whatever there was.  Well, the livestock didn   t have anything. They had to get rid of them.  Mrs. Spurgeon, did you ever go on a rabbit drive?  12  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Paustenbaugh  Spurgeon  Paustenbaugh  Spurgeon  Paustenbaugh  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Kite  L. Perkins  Kite  Poorbaugh  Kite  W. Perkins  I was there when they had one. I saw them bring them in.  We just saw a picture of one. It was quite a sight, the pile of rabbits. But they  were rabbits that weren   t good to eat, right? They were jack rabbits?  Well they got a disease also, and my uncle killed them for his dogs, I guess,  and he got tularemia  boils  from handling the jack rabbits.  They did get a disease in them for a while, but these, I think, were okay.  Is that what they called rabbit fever?  Yes.  Okay, because somebody talked about it today, but they said they didn   t know  if that really existed.  Yes, it did.  Could people get it?  Yes, my Uncle Shannon got it.  What are the symptoms?  I don   t know. I was just a kid, and I don   t remember.  They also got warts all over them too, and boils.  The rabbits did?  Uh-huh.  Well do you remember the first time you saw a big dust storm coming in, what  you thought?  Oh my, these dust storms, I tell you, you couldn   t see. It was terrible. We   d  walk from where we lived there. My dad was a janitor, and my sister and I,  we   d always start when he started, and my mother would say,    Now take a  hold of hands,    because you couldn   t see. Well, we   d worn a path down  through there. We could tell when we   d get out of the path, but if we stayed in  this path, we   d make it to school. And at that time, we didn   t have any street  lights. It was just black. You just felt your way around.  Did you know of anyone that got lost out on the prairie, out on the plains, or  out on the farm?  I don   t know of anybody that got lost, as far as I   m concerned, but I know  where I was at. We had to haul water. The water out on the place we lived  13  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  L. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  L. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  wasn   t good, and we went to the neighbors    and got water. I just walked out of  the house and started to load the water can in the car, and it hit. They yelled at  me not to move. I expect I was as far as from here to that bookcase over there  from the house. They just chained out one by one by hands and kept me  talking and got hold of my hand. I couldn   t tell where I was at. They didn   t  want me to move either direction.  That was Black Sunday, wasn   t it?  Uh-huh, that was Black Sunday April 14th, 1935 at two in the afternoon.  That Black Sunday. We started home, and it just rolled in. You could just see  the clouds rolling, the dirt was rolling.  More birds were in front of it than you could count.  And the birds were all in front of it, and it made the awfulest noise, that dirt  did.  Yeah they did. They were trying to keep away.  It was just weird. We got turned around and went back to Alan   s folks, and we  ran into the house with the car  laughter . You couldn   t see.  You couldn   t see. It was black, just like running into a wall.  We got in the cave and went down in the cave. Mother was carrying the light.  Well, you could just see her outline in this light, but you just couldn   t see. But  we finally made it down the cave.  I was four miles from home herding cattle when it hit. It just came, a cold  wind. I didn   t see it coming. I think I was reading a ranch romance or  something like that  laughing , sitting on my horse. I didn   t see it coming until  it was almost there, and it was a cold wind, strong, and big and black. The  horses wee terrified. They ran around. I could hear them. It was black, you  couldn   t see anything. Of course, my horse that I was on was scared too, and I  had to control him.  I know we were down at Mother Poorbaugh   s, and one of those clouds came  in, and Bud Heglin came in through the door. He said,    I think the Big Boy   s  through with her; he   s a rolling it up,    and he did, you couldn   t see anything.  You could have set a kerosene lamp right there on that table, and from here to  there, you couldn   t see it.  Did other animals exhibit signs of fright? Did the dogs or cats?  I wasn   t around any animals. The chickens went to roost. They thought it was  time to go to bed because it got so dark.  14  Poorbaugh  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Yeah.  How did the cattle survive? That   s something I never understood, about those.  I don   t know. I wasn   t out among the cattle when it occurred.  Well, I don   t know. Of course, I just let the cattle go, because there was no  way I could find them, or the horses either, that I was herding. But my horse,  there was so much dust, and his eyes would water and his nose would water,  and I   d wipe his eyes. It   d just be a lot of mud in the plam of my hands. I   d  dig it out of his nostrils. Of course, they   d blow their noses and take care of  themselves.  I wonder how they stopped from getting dust pneumonia.  They didn   t get dust pneumonia, did they? The cattle?  No, huh-uh.  The cattle didn   t.  They   re pretty tough.  Yeah, they   re used to it.  Yeah, they   re hardy animals.  They   d breathe a little dust every day anyhow, grazing.  They do.  So did you guys just get used to wearing dirty clothes for ten years  laughter   or five years?  Well, you could wash, and the first thing you   d know, you   d be dirty. The  house would be dirty before you   d turn around.  We had to put the zinc jar lids under our beds. The ants, at night, would eat  you up. You put kerosene in them and put them under each one of the bed  legs. The ants were terrible. The ants were so thick and so bad that you could  swipe handfuls of them off the table and still have more ants on the table. Zinc  lids filled with kerosene were also used under table legs to keep them off the  food and table.  Would that be bedbugs?  No, it was ants, little ants. Well, there were some bedbugs involved too.  When we moved down here, two old bachelors lived in that house, and there  were a lot of holes where there   d be pictures hung and so on and so forth  15  Poorbaugh  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  Kite  Poorbaugh   laughter . The first few nights we were there, we   d get up a coming this way  of the morning, and you got little red splotches on you, and we couldn   t figure  what we had, and my mother said,    I think we   d better start looking for  bedbugs.    So every morning then, we had to take a gas can and squirt the  mattress buttons and seams  laughter  until we got rid of those too.  You   d get you a little can of kerosene and a chicken feather, and every little  crack you   d see, you   d put kerosene in it to get rid of the bedbugs.  Mrs. Spurgeon, did you ever have any bedbug problems?  Well, I lived in a fairly new house, and we didn   t have bed bugs there. My  grandmother had bedbugs, and she had a terrible time. I always dreaded to  sleep there.  Those little things would sure catch you of a night.  It wasn   t a sin to get them, but it was if you kept them  laughter    But you can smell them. They didn   t bother these two old bachelors that lived  in this house at all, I guess, because they didn   t do anything about them.  What do they smell like?  Different from anything.  Can you describe it?  No, but when you walk in the house, you can tell if they   ve got bedbugs or not.  Yeah, they   ve got a musty smell.  It   s just a different smell.  And kerosene   s the solution?  Well, partly, but of course, when they got more modern insecticides, that took  care of them, but they   d get into the matresses, and you couldn   t get at them.  Yeah, around those little cotton balls there  Every kid came to school with a little bag around his neck  laughter .  That was to keep the germs away or something.  And you would wear it in a bag around your neck. I   ve heard a few stories  about this. It wasn   t pleasant, is that right?  Yeah   16  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Kite  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Kite  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  I think it just kept everybody far enough away that you couldn   t spread any  germs  laughter    I think that took care of the whole thing.  Well what did it smell like?  I don   t know. We never did have it.  But did you know friends that would come to school with this bag around their  neck?  It stunk, I can tell you that.  His mother made him wear it.  You had to wear it?  You better believe I had to wear it  laughter    It just had a smell of its own. I don   t have that good of a nose, but anyway, it  does have a smell.  How do you spell it? Do you know how you spell that? A-S-     P-H-E-D-I-A. I don   t know for sure how it is, ascphedia, A-S-C-P-H-E-D-I-A.  I   m not sure how it is spelled, but it was supposed to keep you healthy.  We take it for granted now, modern medicine. Well what would you guys do  for medicine if you were poor?Took kerosene and sugar, and you would eat it?  Yeah, you   d just eat it.  And then sulphur?  Just a little bit of sulphur, if you had a sore throat, was good, flowers of  sulphur, not just every kind.  Sometimes you got some sorghum with your sulphur. Flowers of sulphur is a  yellow powder you could buy at a drug store, and you   d just take a point of a  knife and take just a little bit, and it was good for a sore throat.  Any remedies that didn   t work?  They had to work. That was the only thing we had.  None of them worked  laughter    None of them worked?  17  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  Paustenbaugh  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Kite  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Fried onions worked.  You still had a cold for a week   Fried onions worked real well for pneumonia.  Fried onions, I   ve never heard that.  You put them in a bag and put them on your chest.  What was it?  Fried onions.  Onions, oh, uh-huh. My mother gave us castor oil once in a while.  Would you all like some punch?  He   s probably got the wierdest bunch he   s had all day.  It   s getting there  laughter    This is the best one we   ve had all day.  She said this is the best group we   ve had all day.  Well, you   ve kind of got a bunch that   s been on the farm all along, hillbillies.  Well, do you remember people that left the country because they couldn   t take  it?  Oh yeah, there were a lot of people.  Oh, people left here. You remember the Mathers family? They left. They had  a Model-T, and they didn   t have anything. They finally sold two horses and a  wagon, and that   s when they headed for California. They said they pushed that  Model-T up every mountain  laughing  and coasted down it. They had an  awful time getting there, to California, but that   s where they went.  Did you have any other family members or other friends that left? Do ya   ll  remember anybody that you knew leaving?  Our family mostly came back home. The young married couples, they   d come  back home and have their babies, so we had a house full.  Yeah.  I was an only child, so we didn   t have a whole lot of things like that happen.  18  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Poorbaugh  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  There were neighbors that left. Some went to Missouri, and what, Arkansas?  Yeah, every place.  But that   s why all of this land was setting empty. The people had just lost it.  They couldn   t pay for it. It was just being unfarmed and all this.  At one time, it just about averaged a family on every quarter.  And they   ve been leaving ever since, haven   t they? One way or another. A lot  have died, of course, but there are very few people out here anymore.  What about people moving through, like hobos or tramps?  Oh yeah, people would stop in for something to eat. I know Mother  Poorbaugh said they   d follow the railroad track, and it would be out of their  way where they could cut out to the highway, but they would follow that  railroad track, and they   d stop for something to eat. They   d set outside as  she   d fix them something. They had chicken, and they   d fix them an egg  sandwich or something. They were happy to get it.  Do you remember any encounters with drifters?  No, because we were far from any railroad track or highway.  Mrs. Perkins?  No, we were in the country too. We didn   t have drifters.  What about gypsies? We   ve heard a lot of stories of gypsies coming through,  in the panhandle of all places.  Oh yeah, we had gypsies. When I was going to school in Englewood, there  were gypsies that came through.  They came through, but I think they just drifted on.  I always wonder what they were doing here in the first place. If I was  somebody, this isn   t a place I would come.  Well gypsies are a different type of people. They are a nomadic type of  people, and they don   t want to stay in any one place. They go here and there,  but Laura could tell you about the gypsies, I think. She said that they came  through. Of course, they want to read your palm or tell your fortune. This one  old bachelor, well this pretty young gypsy girl was getting friendly with him,  and he found out later that she was picking his pocket  laughter   He thought  that she thought he was real nice, I guess.  When they came through Englewood they   d probably had a team of horses and  19  Kite  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  a covered wagon, a whole load of them. They weren   t going anywhere, and  they weren   t coming from anywhere; they were just there, drifting. But down  here, we didn   t see any gypsies after we moved down here.  Well, do you remember anything specific that made you think times were  getting better, that times were improving? Could you afford to buy something  or not lose something?  It took quite a while to get better.  Yeah, it was a long time. Of course, I got my teacher   s certificate, and well,  the dust storms weren   t all over. I got  60 a month and paid  25 for board and  room. Of course, I couldn   t buy a car or any means of transportation, so I was  walking to school to begin with, and they wanted to loan me their mare to ride  to school. I made an arrangement so that I could bring my own horse, and then  it cost me  15 a month to board my horse, and I didn   t have a whole lot left. I  remember when I started teaching, I had borrowed money from a bank at  Montezuma to get started on, and that   s where I banked my money then that I  earned. I remember one time I had written a check for  2.98, and it was to a  schoolboard member, and my banker turned it down, because I was a few  cents overdrawn. That wasn   t very happy. It took a while for the economy to  come back. It was World War II before the economy ever started getting  better.  But you were teaching eight grades too.  Well yes, I had a smaller school. I just had four grades.  I was reading your pamphlet, your flier that you brought, and you had a pretty  good story in there about the horse breaking through the ice.  Oh, well my daughter wrote that up, and actually, it was the quicksand down  here on the Beaver River that I had trouble with. The river used to come up a  lot more than it does now, since we have the dam and the CRP and all that.  Whenever the river would come up and be rolling, then the quicksand was bad.  One day, as I rode home from school, of course, my horse that I had brought  from home, he was so dumb; he was just as dumb about quicksand as I was,  and when a horse gets in the quicksand, he   d better get to going, but my horse,  he would just stop, and he wouldn   t go. That   s when it lets you sink down,  and he rolled over and kind of caught me, and the water was rolling, so I got  off of him finally; he got off my leg. Then, he wanted to come back to me, but  you   d better get out of the way. If your horse comes lunging, you   d better not  be in the quicksand. Anyway, it was kind of cold. I had my chaps and my  overshoes on, and when I rode into Beryl Howe   s, they were pretty disturbed  about the condition I was in, because my horse and I both were pretty wet.  But you were alive though.  Yes. But then when the river came up, Lena May Howe, one of the pupils, and  20  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  I rode together to school, and it was about three or four miles across the  pasture, and if the river was up, we   d tie our horses on the south side of the  river and walk the pipline bridge, the catwalk. Then, it was about a half a mile  on to school, and we killed a lot of rattlesnakes on the way to school.  So getting to school was a job in itself?  It was, really.  That sounded interesting.  Of course, in other places the ice does break through, and you have to watch. I  don   t know. Linda got a hold of my story and wrote it up. She told about the  ice breaking through on the Beaver, but that was on the Cimarron that that  happened.  The teachers now a days just don   t know what they have got, do they?  Well they sure don   t have to go build a fire and sweep the floor.  We were talking about school lunches a while ago. Before we got out of the  eighth grade out here, they had a big stove with a rim around it and a screen  over the top, so we got to taking stew in glass jars. We   d set it up there, and  we   d have warm lunches. That was the starting of warm lunches  laughter . It  was better than a cold sandwich.  Yeah, cold egg sandwich. Well, do you remember anything that you could do  when times got better that you were excited about that you weren   t able to do  before, go to the movies or go somewhere that you couldn   t go?  We had fun, didn   t we?  Yeah, we did.  It was just as much fun.  To get to your dances up there, we had a team of horses and a four-wheel  trailer with rubber tires on it, and it took us about two and a half hours to go up  there. We   d dance until five o   clock, and then we   d get home in time to milk  the cows and then go to bed  laughter .  That was Bill   s folks, his mother and brothers who played with the bands for  the dances.  It was entertainment.  And we were young and things were fun.  When the moon comes over the mountain was always the last dance, when the  21  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  Poorbaugh  Kite  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Kite  Spurgeon  Kite  Poorbaugh  Kite  sun would be coming up  laughter    You would dance all night?  Dance all night, and then have to come home that far with a team of horses and  a four-wheel trailer.  Work all the next day?  Work all the next day.  Is that where a lot of courting was going on and wives were being met and  husbands were being turned down?  The ladies confirm.   We had some good times.  Where all did you meet your husbands? Where did you guys meet?  At a dance.  I was going to say I thought it was probably a dance. It was probably over at  our house, I think. I think he was over at our house. You got wind by the  grapevine that we were having it.  Well, that   s the first time I met you. I was on the outside of the window, and  there was a screen between us. She was sitting in the window, and I was  outside.  But then, we   d just move furniture out. If somebody wanted to have a dance,  it wouldn   t take us long to clean out the house. We didn   t have that much in  there. If we had a violin and and an organ or a piano or something, we had an  orchestra  laughing    Mrs. Spurgeon, how did you meet your husband?  Well, my sister was boarding with his family when she was teaching school  south of Meade at the old Stone School. She introduced us, I guess. We  weren   t introduced, but that   s how we met.  Mrs. Poorbaugh, how   d you meet your husband?  Let   s see, it would be a long story  laughter . My grandfather lived about a  mile and a half from his folks. He came out a few times, and then he found his  way to Knowles quite often  laughter . I think we went together about a year  and a half or two years before we decided to get married. He played baseball.  He played a lot of baseball. We put in our time to playing baseball, and well,  we went a lot. He had a nice Chevrolet coup.  Well what would a typical date be like? When you would go out on a date with  22  Poorbaugh  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Kite  Poorbaugh  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Kite  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Kite  L. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  your boyfriend, what would you do? If you didn   t have money or resources,  what would a date be like?  When he played baseball, he was paid. If he played with Ashland or Buffalo  or some place like that, they always paid Allen to play baseball with them.  Oh, it wasn   t a whole lot. Nobody got a whole lot then.  So going to a party or going to a dance was a typical date or a typical time out  with your boyfriend or whoever.  Probably. We didn   t go to many pictures shows, did you?  No, not really.  Well, now up there at Knowles, we had a picture machine. My dad ran it.  They were silent pictures. They had shows in the schoolhouse there for quite a  while.  Did you have a favorite movie star?  Oh no, not really. All of them looked good to me.  Mrs. Perkins, did you have a favorite movie star?  Roy Rogers or Hop Along Cassidy or any of those. We always enjoyed those  western shows. Gene Autry.  I don   t remember, but I did.  There weren   t very many shows that we went to.  Because they weren   t here or you couldn   t afford to go?  Well, most of them were far away.  At that time, getting to Laverne wasn   t as easy as it is now.  Well, in my opinion, you all lived through some pretty rough times, pretty hard  times.  You can say that again.  And you made it. What do you think you carry with you from those times? Is  there something that comes back to your mind a lot or things that had changed  you forever? What   s your most vivid memory of that time, or the thing you  carry with you?  When I go down past that pasture, I can see those cattle. I think of that often  when I go down that road. I can just see those cattle heaped up there where  23  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Kite  they   d killed them at the bottom of it. That was kind of a sad deal, cows that  we thought a lot of, but we couldn   t feed them. I never go by that, but I can  just see that canyon over there full of cows.  I think for my husband and me, we tried to save. We learned to save our  money and not squander it. I think children now a days don   t know how to  save money, do they? They take for granted things that we didn   t need at all.  We don   t need all these things.  Set out there and milk cows all week and separate the milk and cream and take  a little five gallon can to town and a few eggs and try to buy enough groceries  to last you another week.  Yeah, but when other people were going hungry, we had plenty to eat. All  through the hard times and the dust storms, we never went hungry. We never  went hungry during the dust storms.  No.  And we didn   t feel poor. Everybody was in the same boat.  And you butchered your own meat.  Tell him about your dad and the beef. I think that   s interesting.  Dad would butcher beef, probably a thousand pounds of beef, and string it up  in the cottonwood shed and leave it there all winter long. It stayed froze.  You   d wrap a sheet around it and pin it up. Hogs were the same way. We had  meat and beef and pork. We didn   t go hungry.  Our seasons were colder then than they are now. You couldn   t do that now.  That   s the way with the Poorbaughs, they   d hang this beef up there, and they   d  form a crust on the outside. It would dry, and that would cure that beef inside.  You   d just trim off that little old crust, and it was just as tender as it could be.  If you wanted a t-bone steak, you   d go out there and let it down and cut off a t-bone  steak.  It may not be the fanciest butchering job you ever saw, but anyway, it was  edible.  I think the last time we had a butchering of hogs, I think we butchered eight  that day, and that was quite a job. Pickled pigs feet, I made pickled pigs feet   Good, weren   t they?  They were good?  24  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Kite  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Yeah they were good. My mother always made head cheese out of the head.  You   d grind it and make head cheese.  Scrapple.  Was that entrails?  No, no, we didn   t use that. My mother, stuffed sausage with a certain thing  from the entrails.  You   d take the linings out and clean them, and then you   d have to have a  sausage stuffer and stuff them.  And you   d take the cracklins, and you made soap out of it. I made a lot of  soap.  It cleans your hair real well.  It was good wash soap.  Well, any last words you want to tell posterity about the dust bowl? Now   s  your chance.  Just tell them that we hope they don   t have to go through such a thing.  Well, I don   t think our generation of today could go through what we went  through.  You know, you   re talking about me now.  I don   t think they could.  I think you could, don   t you?  Yes.  I think you could.  I have a grandaughter that it   s just so dead for her down here that she won   t  come down here. She   s used to computers and all that stuff. She can   t find  anything to do down there. My kids get out there and take a little iron wheel  and a stick and roll it all over the streets.  Were those days the good old days?  They were good for then, but not now.  I think something passes from one generation to the other, don   t you think? If  it comes to that point, that you need that strength, don   t you think you will  25  Kite  Spurgeon  L. Perkins  Kite  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Kite  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Kite  Poorbaugh  Kite  Paustenbaugh  have?  You weren   t asked if you wanted to have those days put on you; they just came.  You were forced to deal with them. I think you would deal with what confronts  you.  Yes, and what is happening now is more scary, isn   t it?  I think so.  Yeah.  You didn   t have money, but you didn   t need money.  We made our own entertainment. We   ll put it that way. You weren   t  entertained then; you made your own.  I thought it was bad we didn   t have nice clothes. Well, we were teenage girls  and we just didn   t have the nice clothes.  You had one dress to wear to town on Saturday when we went. You had to  keep it washed and ironed. You didn   t have a whole closet full.  Well, during the Depression, it was hard for the ball players to have mits.  Well, Allen   s mitt, my husband   s mitt, his mitt is simply rotted out inside. I  found an old leather suede jacket, and I put a lining in that mitt, and it really  looked all right and they did all right. I tell you, here came the mitts.  Everybody sent out one. I   d put a new lining in it if they   d send a jacket or  something for me to work with. I don   t know how many ball gloves I put the  lining back in.  Do you have any pictures of him playing baseball?  Oh, I think I have. Oh, I surely have some place.  I   ll bet you have.  Well, we   re going to be out here in this area again talking to people in Beaver  and Harper County, and one thing we   d like to ask of you, if you agree, is to  let us copy your pictures for our collection.  You want some pictures?  We would take the pictures, or you could send them if you would like, and we  would make negative reproductions of them and then send the pictures back.  Have you been giving people our address?  No, but in the follow up letter that we send to them, they   ll have the address.  26  Kite  Spurgeon  Paustenbaugh  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Kite  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  All right. Well, that   s something you can think about, if you can go dig up  some pictures.  I think I might have some pictures.  That   s great, if you have a picture of you sticking a knife into the back of a  cow   Our kids at home, they take a little round wheel like up in a drill, a press wheel  on a drill and take a lathe and put a cross-piece on it. It   s a skill to get out and  run that thing and get it to go straight. They could just go out there in the shop  and get all kinds of things to play with. They didn   t have any fancy toys   laughing . Now a days, kids have to have toys. They don   t know how to do  that.  I think one thing that was bad about that time was, I think I told you that my  sister had gone to the A M college at Stillwater  Oklahoma A M , and it was  1928 or somewhere in there, when we still had some money, and she went two  years, but then she had to give it up because of the hard times. I think that was  a bad thing for her.  It was sad to have to leave school.  Yes.  I don   t know how in the world we ever washed on a washboard. I think about  that, and it   s scary  laughter .  My mother had a clothes stomper.  Yeah, I ran one of those too. And then my mother got an old washing  machine. It had a handle, but then my dad was pretty inventive, so he fixed a  foot-pedal in there. He fixed a little push pedal on the hand lever where I  could set on a chair and pull and push, and pull and push, and that was the  motor for that washing machine.  You were the motor.  I was the motor, but he fixed us a deal to where we could push it. That was  better than having to just use your arms.  And would your clothes come out clean?  Oh yeah. I don   t know how, but they did.  Women kept their clothes clean.  Yeah, with lye soap.  27  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  Kite  W. Perkins  Spurgeon  Poorbaugh  Kite  Spurgeon  W. Perkins  L. Perkins  W. Perkins  Poorbaugh  W. Perkins  Kite  They made their clothes clean in those days.  The washer had a thing inside of it like a milk stool. It had four inch legs on it,  a round deal with four deals on it, and it just went around and around like an  agitator.  It was surprising. The people were proud, and the tried to keep clean and have  things just as good as they could have, and they worked hard to have it.  But that washing on the washboard, I don   t know how in the world we ever got  clothes washed  laughter    It was an all day job.  Would there be one day a week that was wash day?  Yeah, Monday. Monday was wash day and beans, beans and cornbread for  dinner.  Bill   s mother used to have these big iron kettles and heated the wash water,  washed outdoors, and beans for dinner. Then, of course, I guess mopped the  floor with the leftover wash water.  When we   d bucher, we   d use this great big iron kettle to render lard in. We  had a boat paddle we stirred with.  Why would you have beans on wash day?  Because they would cook themselves.  They were easy to cook and easy to get.  I   ve still got one of those old iron kettles.  You always had a wash boiler that you boiled the clothes in. We always  boiled them in this iron kettle out there. That bleaches your white clothes.  You always boiled your clothes.  Yeah, a washbord or an iron kettle to boil your white clothes.  Well, I think we   re going to have to close it up here. It sounds like we could go  on all night.  -------  -------
