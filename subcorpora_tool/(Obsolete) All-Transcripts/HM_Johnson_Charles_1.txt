Speaker 1: --All right.  Now, before we get into depth, you know, there are five light-weight "People" Magazinish-type questions that we always ask.  They just require a short answer.  And the first one is, Sir, what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Well they call it soul food, I guess.  I never was a person that eat beans and greens, I never liked them, but mostly fried food, chicken, chops, steaks, stews, so forth and so on, like that. (phone ringing)  Damn, I think I can reach it from here.  The telephone.

Story_ID: 79376
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Well, let me ask you about your family history.  How far back can you go with your family history and where did your people come from originally, you know?
Speaker 2: My family consisted of my mother [Alice Totton Johnson], her brother and her mother, that's the only family that I know about.
Speaker 1: But, Sir, do you know anything about your grandparents or about where they came from?
Speaker 2: My grandmother, my mother's mother, which was my grandmother, was a Seminole Indian.  Her mother wasn't a slave and she says she had a family and at times men would come by at night and her father would leave with them and sometimes be gone for a couple of days and he come back and was always at night, they traveled by night.  And one night he left and he never come back anymore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then that left her and her mother and brothers and sisters and she said one day some people came by in a wagon and grabbed up her sisters and brothers and put em in the wagon and they missed her because, while they was trying to catch the others, she ran under the house and hid.  They didn't find her.  So that just left her and her mother.
Speaker 1: Do you think that the people that came and got them were trying to help them escape from slavery or were they trying to hurt them?
Speaker 2: Well that she never explained, she don't know, cause she said she was small, you know, and she remembered that, but just who they were and what they was after, she don't know.  It could have been they wanted to try to sell em, you know, cause at that time there was slavery.  But Indians was not slaves.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other stories about her that you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes.  After her--just left, she and her mother and then her mother passed away, and what her mother did was washed and iron for people, that's how she survived and they were living on a farm like, and this owner of this farm was a Caucasian and he took advantage of her being a young woman, young child.  I recall she used to let her hair down and she could sit on it.  Her hair was that long, my grandmother, now I remember her, you know.  But that was my family, very poor family, never had anything to amount to anything, but survived.
Speaker 1: Now was the--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --Was the Caucasian man your father's father or what?
Speaker 2: My father, I don't know what he was.  My mother told me on a couple of occasions, I saw your father, but I never saw him to know him, and what he was, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your immediate family was your mother--
Speaker 2: Uncle and grandmother.
Speaker 1: --Grandmother.
Speaker 2: Far as the father concerned, I knew nothing about none of em.
Story_ID: 79377
Speaker 1: Now what--do you remember much about Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Not very much, no.  Cause I--in 1916, we left from down there and went to Kansas City.  And my mother [Alice Totton Johnson] left first, as--my mother was never home much.  She was the bread-winner I guess you may call it.  She wasn't home much, so.  I'd see her every so often.  What she was doing or what, I don't know, but she decided she'd go to Kansas City.  So she went to Kansas City, and she got a job.  In the meantime, my uncle had gotten married.  So after she got located up there and got a job, she sent back down there and got my uncle's wife and brought--and she went to Kansas City, and she got a job.  And the next thing they sent and got my grandmother and that left my uncle and my--getting ready to go up there.  As I--my uncle were blind but he and I traveled to Kansas City and that was 1916, and we stayed in Kansas City until '18' (1918), '19' (1919) and went back to Pine Bluff.  And during the winter of 19 and--19, 19 and--the early 1920, my mother got married to a farmer that lived about eighty miles from Pine Bluff [Arkansas].  And he took us down there, my grandmother and my mother and myself.  We went down there to live with him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And in the meantime he had two other boys there with him that his former wife had passed away.  I left my uncle and his family in Pine Bluff.  Well, I get down there and like I stated early about the food situation, all they had was salt pork and greens and beans and on a Sunday, they'd kill a chicken, stuff like that.  I didn't eat it.  And all I would eat was--I could remember I'd take biscuit, milk and sugar, buttermilk and biscuit, and that's what I'd have for dinner.  So I didn't like the situation and I wrote and told my uncle to send me money to--train fare to come up there--back to Pine Bluff, and he did.  And I went back to Pine Bluff.  And I slipped off.  Nobody knew it.  They didn't know where I was until I wrote and told em.
Speaker 1: Now, I want to go back just a little bit.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Alice--you want the maiden name, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Alice Totton.  She was a T-O-T-T-O-N, Totton.  That was this Caucasian's name.
Speaker 1: And when was she born?
Speaker 2: Where was she born?
Speaker 1: When?
Speaker 2: I don't know. [phone ringing] Like I told you I don't know too much about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I didn't hear you.
Speaker 1: I said go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I don't know when she was born.
Speaker 1: And what was her name after she was married?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a Johnson, I guess.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: I guess.  She was a Johnson and then she become a Smith.  This last husband she was a Smith, Alice Smith.
Speaker 1: All right.  So you kind of escaped then?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You were saying that you escaped, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well they come and got me and took me back down there.  And when I left the last time, I didn't go back anymore.
Speaker 1: Now how old were you when you left?
Speaker 2: The last time?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Story_ID: 79378
Speaker 1: Now, can you, can you maybe think back on your childhood, when you were a little fellow, give us some idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in Arkansas, I guess, in Kansas City?
Speaker 2: Well, I know we lived across the street from the school that I attended.  We call em Reserved Street School, which was at Seventh and Missouri.  It was a school there that I went to school to.  And back to the situation about the second time I left from down there, I wrote--my uncle had left Pine Bluff [Arkansas] and went to Saint Louis [Missouri].  And I wrote and told him I want to come to Saint Louis, send me some money and he did.  Well, back there then, the young men were hoboing, leaving from the South, coming north and what not for--try better conditions, and what not, and that was going on pretty strong.  So my uncle sent me the money and the two boys and myself was working at the sawmill between--well about a mile from town.  We lived in the country five miles from town, so that morn--every morning we'd have to get up to go to work, walk those four miles, we'd run and walk, had to be there at seven o'clock, so naturally we'd leave home around five in the morning.  And my grandmother had left and she had went to town and got a job cooking and ironing and washing for people living on the place they call it.  And this particular Saturday we worked to twelve o'clock.  And now we go uptown to get our little money from the man operating the saw mill.  He had a store also.  So on my way up there, I stopped by my grandmother's place and took me a bath and what not.  She always kept some of my clothes.  So I found some clothes to put on.  And I didn't tell her that I was gonna leave, I didn't tell my mother [Alice Totten Johnson] I was gonna leave.  So went up there to the store to get my money.  So he said, "Well, you know I hold back two days every week," I said, "Well you give that to my grandmother."  Fortunately, my mother decide--she came to town.  So she put the horse in the little place where they--people would put em when they come in with the buggies and what not.  And then I told her that I was leaving that evening when the train come through there.  She started to cry and tell me "You can't hobo, you're too small."  I told her I wasn't gon hobo.  "Well how you  expect--" I said, "I'm going to ride the passenger train."  I never will forget that.  She said, "Where you get money from boy?"  I told her.  And she said this to me, which has stayed with me, never will forget it.  She said, "If I had train fare back to Pine Bluff, I would go back home and go back to work in the hotel where I used to work."  And I said to her, "Do you want to leave your husband?"  She said, "I want to leave from down here."  And I said to her, "Let's go see how much the train fares is."  Went over to the little station, asked the ticket agent how much a half fare was to Saint Louis, I could ride for half fare, he told me.  How much is a full fare to Pine Bluff, he told me.  Checked my little bankroll and said "We got enough."  And when the train came that evening, we got on it.  Didn't have nothing but what I had on, she didn't have anything but what she had on.  And we got to Pine Bluff, she kissed me goodbye, and I come on up to Little Rock and changed trains in Little Rock and took a train out of there to Saint Louis.  And I haven't been back but once since then.  My wife's [Julia Johnson] home is in Vicksburg, Mississippi, I think, in 1941-'42' (1942), somewhere along in there, we drove down to Vicksburg and I came back through Pine Bluff, and I haven't been back since.
Speaker 1: It seems as though you didn't like Pine Bluff very much.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: It seems as though you didn't like Pine Bluff very much?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't know nothing about it very much.  Like I said, see in the early years, I followed my family, whatever they did I had to go along with it, you know, cause I was nothing but a child.
Speaker 1: Well how old were you when you left?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: How old were you when you left?
Speaker 2: When I left from down there?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen. Thirteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 79379
Speaker 1: And within them two years, I come to Saint Louis [Missouri], I started selling papers.  One day I gets a letter from my mother [Alice Totten Johnson] said she was coming to Chicago [Illinois], she was coming through Saint Louis, that her husband had sold out for the little bit he had, and he was here in Chicago and had gotten a job working in the stock yard.  And she was coming to him.  But she come through there and she stopped and made me start to going to school, cause I wasn't going to school.  I had just cigars a penny--boxes of penny--cigar boxes of pennies, cause I think the paper was three cents back there then.  Yeah, oh I was rich.   So--
Speaker 2: Well how were you living at age thirteen in Saint Louis, I mean--
Speaker 1: My uncle and his wife--
Speaker 2: --Okay.
Speaker 1: --And two boys.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And so one day I gets a letter from her from up here saying she was sick and she wanted me to come.  Now this was 1925.  See when I left from down there it was 1923, '24' [1924], I guess, somewhere along in there.  But anyway in 1925 I came here [Chicago, Illinois] in February, 1925, and she died in April.  They operated on the third of April and she died on the tenth.  So my uncle and his family came here and stayed a little while and as I told you early, he was a gambler, he couldn't get his connection like he had in Saint Louis, so he went back.  So out of the clear blue--that left my stepfather and grandmother and myself living at 3914 State [Street].  So on a day out of the clear blue sky he said to me, "I'm going to send your grandmother down to Saint Louis to her son.  And I'll send you if you want to go.  I'm giving up this flat."  And I said to him, you send your grandmother, you can send her, I'll go for myself.  So he did that.
Speaker 2: Now how old were you then.
Speaker 1: Fifteen.
Speaker 2: Fifteen?
Speaker 1: Yeah, fifteen.
Story_ID: 79380
Speaker 1: Were you in school then?
Speaker 2: No, I never went to school anymore.  I went to school one, part of one semester at night at Wendell Phillips [High School], but I never finished grammar school, never finished grammar school.  I got a job working in the grocery store at 4106 State Street, one of them, what they called, "Ma and Pa" stores you know.  And this man had six sons, five of em was still at home, one had a grocery store at thirty-first and Dearborn, the oldest boy.  And at night the old lady'd make down pallets and they had--the next two was grown, one was a butcher and one was a clerk and the three others is in my age bracket like.  And she used to make a pallet down on the floor every night, and that's where we four slept.  I stayed right there with em.  Yeah, till I got tired and I--now see back there it was twenty-five [1925] and I got a job at the stockyard I think around in 1926, somewhere along in there, '27' [1927], somewhere along in there.  But then in and out you know working in and out.  But like I said I never had no problem until I got grown.  Before I got grown I was always working.  And in the meantime my step-daddy's uncle--nephew lived at 3922 State.  And I got a room living with them and the next thing I know my step-daddy came there, and he had a room, he had his room and I had mine.  So my uncle wrote the Chicago Police Department telling them that I was up here, a minor, he wanted me back there in Saint Louis, and I had told em that I felt that with my grandmother back there now and him with two children, his wife had enough on her, she had enough.  Cause if they  was--I don't know, when I was living there we had this one room and a part of kitchen-like and the two boys and me slept on the floor on a pallet, like I said, very poor people.  So I couldn't see myself going back there piling up there with--and had to try to start over again to get a job, when I got a job here.  So finally one day the police come looking for me on a couple occasions and I never was home.  Now I was working--these people had--made wine right at the corner, almost to the corner of 40th and State, and the police would see me practically every day.  So when they was looking for me, they didn't know who the hell they was looking for.  And when they did catch up with me, say, "Well I'll be damned, we see this guy boy every day."  Yeah, you do.  But then when they found out that my stepfather was there in that house, said wasn't nothing they could do about it, because that's where my mother left me with him.  So that's my, about my story from then on, like I say, I went for myself.
Story_ID: 79381
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you feel pretty confident you can make it on your own?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, I felt just that confident.  And like I said I never had a problem until after I got grown.  When I got outdoors and hungry and everything, I was a grown man.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: The [Great] Depression hadn't hit yet, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: No.  It hadn't.
Speaker 1: It hadn't hit.  So things were a little bit better?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Times were a little bit better, you know.
Speaker 1: And that area that you lived in is now like--it's now the projects.  But the projects hadn't been built then, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, hell no, no, no, no.  Mostly every--along in that block was a store front on the first floor and a flat upstairs, two flat--two place.  Mostly every building along there at that time.
Speaker 1: Was that like a heavy shopping district?
Speaker 2: Everything was "Ma and Pa" then, it wasn't no big shopping areas around like--like there are now.  See everything back there then was "Ma and Pa" stores, you know.  Take like that 41st and State, there were three stores right there together, it was two on the west side and one on the east side where "Pekins" is there now.  Pekin Cleaner along in there?  It was a grocery store in there at one time.  Yeah.  And right up above us there, it was three stores right there together.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you weren't going to school, but you were working doing various things?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you get started playing baseball, I mean, had you been playing all along?  Well, I guess you had.
Speaker 2: Well, it was something that I could do when I was small, yeah.  I always could play baseball, yeah.  Yeah when I was even--I would play with the larger men mostly you know, yeah.  I always loved to play baseball and always could.  So it wasn't hard for me to adjust myself to it.  And then naturally I didn't have no family, nobody to bothered with, I just traveled and it was thrilled to me in a way of speaking, you know, town to town, yeah, town to town.  And every team that I played with most--was traveling teams, you know, town to town.
Story_ID: 79382
Speaker 1: How did you go from just playing pick-up games to playing in an organized league?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess it's like anything else, you move up, you know.  Somebody tells somebody and so--it wasn't anybody recruiting like they are now.
Speaker 1: Now you said off camera that various churches had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Like a team--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. yeah.
Speaker 1: --And church leagues
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --And sometimes the members, I mean, the players would be recruited from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Like the churches like you say Quinn Chapel [A.M.E. Church in Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Monumental [Baptist Church]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Children Baptist?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bethesda.
Speaker 1: Bethesda.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now there was a young fellow that used to write a article in the "Bulletin," it's a little black paper they called the "Bulletin", name was Wiggins.  You read about him?  Anyway, most of his whole career was played with the Bethesda Baseball Team, and all his writing was about Bethesda's Team, and they had a very good team, very good team, until he went to the Palmer House.  He went to work at the Palmer House, and they put a team together down there, the Palmer House, yeah.  A lot of the guys got out of baseball and went to work down there at the Palmer House, quite a few of em, waiting table, yeah.
Speaker 1: They said it was a Radcliffe brother that you met that got you into formal baseball?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, how did that happen?
Speaker 2: Alec [Alex Radcliffe] was playing with Joe Green, Chicago Giants at the time.  Double Duty [HM Ted "Double Duty" Radcliffe] was with the Illinois Giants but he wasn't never home much.  But Alec, he lived there at 35th and his brother Fernand [ph.], they lived with the mother and the father and sisters.  But Duty was always gone.  He never lived there much.  So they were mostly responsible for me starting to playing cause I went to Joe Green in 1928, first time I went to play with him, through them, yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did they get you involved in it, what happened?
Speaker 2: That's what I said, Alec Radcliffe, he was playing with Joe Green, Chicago Giants at the time, and he recommended me to Joe Green.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So were there different leagues then or--
Speaker 2: Joe Green was affiliated with the baseball league.
Speaker 1: --Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was also an independent.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But like I said early, [Frank] Leland, Joe Green started out with [Andrew] "Rube" Foster, but somewhere along the line, they fell out.
Speaker 1: So Rube Foster had a separate league from theirs?
Speaker 2: He started the league.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He organized the league.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But one league but it had like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --They had different teams.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Wasn't nothing bout out east.  It was all out west here, Chicago [Illinois], Memphis [Tennessee], Birmingham [Alabama], Nashville [Tennessee], who else was it, about it, Kansas City.  And the Indianapolis Clowns.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can you name those teams like Kansas City Monarchs?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Indianapolis Clowns, Birmingham--
Speaker 2: Black Barons.
Speaker 1: --Black Barons.
Speaker 2: Memphis Red Sox, Nashville Elite Giants, yeah.
Story_ID: 79383
Speaker 1: Now what position did you play?
Speaker 2: Outfield and pitching.
Speaker 1: You were right-hander or left-hander?
Speaker 2: Right-hander.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you pitch a lot?
Speaker 2: I started the pitching in Canada cause I was playing outfield before I went there.  And with them two games a day and 12, 13, what did we have, mostly it was 14 ball players on the team.  So we had a thing going that whoever got hold of the new ball they was gon pitch that day, yeah, yeah.  Always had to have two catchers, you know.  But that's what started me to pitching.
Speaker 1: Now was pitching a tough job?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Is pitching a pretty tough job in baseball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yes, yeah, yeah.   Yeah, pretty tough.
Speaker 1: Nowadays a pitcher pitches (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Really, hey, they got--everything is like strawberries.  I don't know the way they cry and carry on now, I don't know how they'd a made it back there with us.  See that--can you see that scar there?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: Can you see that?
Speaker 1: Yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I got hit in a little town in Canada, and the doctor come what was seven or eight miles and all he did--back there then you know we used to put Vaseline on our hair and he took some Vaseline and put on it.
Speaker 1: That's all?
Speaker 2: That's just how close I got--could have got--actually, I just got my head back far, and it (making sound) squeaked by me like that.  Broke this arm, you see it's crooked there?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Broke that finger, see.  See it's larger than the rest of em?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all that, shit; never stopped playing with this finger; just couldn't pitch none, but didn't never stopped playing.
Speaker 1: Now, when you pitched, what was your best pitch, I mean, what was your--
Speaker 2: --Whatever I could get em out with, like anything else, you might get em out with a fast ball this time and the next time, he might knock it out of the ball park on you, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Were they pitching the same basic pitches then as they pitch now?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Same basic pitches--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, same thing, same thing.
Speaker 1: --Knuckle ball--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Of course we used to cheat quite a bit, what they can't do in the major league, just like Satchel [Paige].  Satchel used to reach down and get a hand full of dirt and when you look up, you see dirt, ball and all coming, couldn't do that after he got up in the Major League.  Used to take his fingernail and cut the threads in there.  Couldn't do that after he got up there, you know. Satchel used to do all that.
Speaker 1: --Now what did cutting the threads make it do, what did it make the ball do?
Speaker 2: Sail, ball sail.  You can scrape it and it'll sail.  Like take a piece of sand paper and rough it, (making sound) sail just like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was all the tricks of the trade?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 79384
Speaker 1: So who were your team mates on the--?
Speaker 2: Whole lot of em like I said cause I played with a lot of different teams.  And how they come about was whoever offered me, never paid me, but whoever offered it.  I might be on here today and you have said I'll give you so much tomorrow and I'm gone.  Maybe I don't get it either, after I get there you know that's just the way it was.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the difference between, I mean, most people today are familiar with the way the major sports teams are managed where they put a player on a contract and they agree to pay him a certain amount of money over time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that the case in the Negro leagues?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is what I'm trying to tell you.  They never had a bona fide contract.  Everything was in their favor.  If you broke your arm they didn't pay you a dime, if you broke your ankle, you couldn't play.  What they say, well, we gon have a day for him, we gon announced to the fans to take up a collection.
Speaker 1: So that's about what you would get?
Speaker 2: They ain't gon give you notin.  And a lot of em don't like me for that because I tell the truth.
Speaker 1: So even if you were like a top player, if you were one of their best players and you hurt something and can't play, they wouldn't try to--
Speaker 2: I'm telling you what they did.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Well it would seem like it would be in their interest to--
Speaker 2: Only thing in their interest was what they got out of it.  That's what I'm trying to tell you, you know.  Now, like I said, I think I told you this earlier, [James Leslie "J.L."] Wilkinson was the only white owner in the Negro League back there at that time.  And when [Jackie] Robinson--they took Robinson Kansas City, that's where he was playing with Kansas City Monarchs.  And he said they didn't offer him a dime, but after the second year then they offered him $5000, and he wouldn't take it because he didn't want Frank Young writing up saying that he was getting rid of the best ball players and so forth.  He said that's why I didn't take it, being the only white owner.  But then when they--like I said earlier they found out what type of con--so-called contracts that these people had with these--nothing to stop em from not giving em a dime.  So the majority of them didn't get nothing for them ball players until old [Albert Benjamin] "Happy" Chandler finally told em to give em something.  But most of em have been taken then.  Just like Johnny, Johnny Washington, he got players--he never made it to Boston [Massachusetts]. He was in the Minors, but he never got--and like you said, he was down there with the Memphis Red Sox, no American Giants when the--and when he left and went--and the manager told him, he said, "Man, if they want you go head on cause you ain't gonna get nothing here."  But I didn't know Johnny back there then see.
Speaker 1: Now what year did you start playing?
Speaker 2: When I stopped playing?
Speaker 1: No, start?
Speaker 2: Twenty-eight [1928].
Speaker 1: Nineteen Twenty-eight [1928].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And you played for--
Speaker 2: --Off and on, just round '40' (1940)--when the war was over, '45' (1945), '44' (1944), '43' (1943), '44' (1944), somewhere along in there.
Speaker 1: --Okay.  Can you name all the teams you played for?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Can you name all of the teams that you played for?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Well we start out with the American Giants, start out with the National Elite Giants then we go to Joe Green Chicago Giants then we go to Peters Union Giants then we go to Murphys Illinois Giants then we go to Rodgers Hartford Giants then we go to Rod Whitman's Texas Giants and then we go to the All Nation Clowns.  How's that?
Speaker 1: That's all giants and one clown.
Speaker 2: Yep, most of em.  I had my friend ask me, how come there were so many giants.  I said, hell, I don't know.  I didn't name the team the giants, that was--yeah.
Speaker 1: All giants and one clown.  Now on the Clowns, did you have to--was it more of an entertainment thing?
Speaker 2: That, that's basically, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 79385
Speaker 1: Well, now, tell me about the international-was, was it the International Clowns?
Speaker 2: All Nation they called it.
Speaker 1: All Nations Clowns.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was on there by myself at one time, one black then Morehead came, that was two blacks then they got to Renna, which was a Cuban, but the rest of em was Caucasian and what not, Polish, I guess and some Italian and different, you know.
Speaker 1: Now was it like baseball version of the Harlem Globetrotters or something?
Speaker 2: We travelled.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Travelled, yeah they travelled.
Speaker 1: Did you perform like tricks and stuff with the ball?
Speaker 2: Not much of that but little bit of it, but just had some suits made and they paint their faces and what not and clown around.  Most of all them towns would have a parade you know and we'd be on whatever the vehicle we's in in the clown suits and what not, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So that was interesting because it was a kind of a comedy team, but it was an integrated team--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Which is not generally the case, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You didn't find that much.  So you think that people accepted it because it was it was comedy?
Speaker 2: I can tell you one thing that happened.  The guy owned the team was a black man.  But the guy that was promoting it was a white fellow and he was known all up around through in Wisconsin in them towns and they all thought he owned that team until one day this black guy decided he was gon come along and went in one of them taverns up there and told--I'm so and so and so and so, I own--shit, we had to come home.  The telephone start to ringing and what not, the guy was doing this booking and what not name Tip O'Neill, slick little fellow, you know.  He said "Jesus Christ, John, what the hell did you do that for?"  So that's what you think about him.  We had one Jewish boy on there and he would--like to drink beer.  His family had a store over there on the West Side in "Jew Town" and he--up and through and Wisconsin there they had beerish places, although it's supposed to been dry, you know.  And he'd walk in there, always wanted [Albert] Morehead and me to go with him, both of us if we wanted.  And Morehead smoked cigars, he'd buy Morehead a cigar sometimes me a pack of cigarettes and things like that.  And guy walk in there and he go--"What the hell you looking at, you think it look--and he'd grab a glass and throw it.  They'd put him in jail, the ball club would bail him out.  He'd write home, give me some money, and they'd send him some money he'd pay back.  So we went in the Baraboo, Wisconsin.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: I'm mo try to refresh your memory.  During the Jane Byrne's reign as mayor [of Chicago, Illinois], she used to have the circus come in here from Baraboo, Wisconsin.  It's about, oh, 150 miles, somewhere along in there up there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I think it's off of 51, I believe it is.
Story_ID: 79386
Speaker 1: We had a game in Portage [Wisconsin], about thirty or something miles from Baraboo [Wisconsin] on a Saturday.  I pitched that Saturday, and I was lucky enough to win.  We had hotel accommodations in Baraboo that Saturday night according to the wire that we got.  So after the ball game, we jumped in the bus and headed for Baraboo, uniforms and all on, hoping when we get there we'd get us a good bath and everything and get cleaned up.  So we arrived in Baraboo and found this little hotel, I never will forget that either.  It was kind of--little office downstairs like a storefront and the rooms is upstairs.  Got out of the bus and went in, a little clerk said, "I don't know nothing about no reservation for ya'll."  Said "What do you mean you don't, I got it right here, this is the manager," come out, "I don't know nothin about it, ain't nobody said nothin to me about no reservations and first of all you got them two niggers on here."  Okay.  Now we standing outside on a little sidewalk there, bus parked there, some sittin in the bus, some standing around waiting for the manager of the team.  He hadn't showed up.  So finally he showed up and the first thing he said was "I been trying to find a place for ya'll to stay, but I can't find no place cause you got these two niggers on it."  When he said that the manager said, "All right fellows, let's load up, let's go.  We'll stop along the road somewhere and get something to eat, whatever town we was going to the next day."  "You can't leave here you gotta a contract so and so and so and so."  So they started a argument between them.  It was a man standing there with a little boy about five or six year's old.  So he said to our manager, he said, "Can I speak to you a minute," he said, "Yeah."  So he start to walk off, said, "You don't need to walk off, whatever you got to say, say it, we don't have no secrets."  He said, "Well I heard what that so and so said to you," he said "now I'm an engineer on the railroad, and I'm gon be home tomorrow and I want to see a ball game."  He said "If ya'll agree, I'll take the whole damn team home with me."  He said, "Now I don't have beds for everybody, but we'll make pallets on the floor and so forth and so."  He had a single-family home just like this one here, I think, three bedrooms in it, garage in the back.  So the manager said "Ya'll here what this man said?" "Yeah, we heard him."  "What you think about it, Al?" Morehead, Morehead said "all right," Morehead said "What about it Charlie?" I said "It's okay with me."  Man run to the phone and called his wife and told her, call Jane so--it was her friend, "I'm bringing the whole team home for dinner, fifteen of us."
Story_ID: 79387
Speaker 1: He took us all to his-[Al] Morehead and I--now the guy that owned this ball team, he was in the moving and storage furniture business--moving and storage business.  And they had them big old heavy things that you wrap furniture with, you know what I'm talking about, and we used to take a couple of them in the bus, put em down in between the isle there, whoever got down there first, everybody'll pile on top of him you know and lay there and sleep while we ridin, so we--Morehead and I went out there on the bus and got them things, brought em in there and put em down on the floor, pull off them uniform, the man come out there with a big thing of hot water and poured that in a big tub, come back with another one and layed them uniforms out on the grass and hell, I think it's June or July, pretty hot, didn't take long for em to dry.  Got ourself cleaned up, them ladies got food ready and everybody got through eaten, now this old Jew boy want to go downtown, "uh-uh, no, we ain't going down there, we ain't going down there."  I don't know if anybody stayed in the man's house, but practically everybody was out there in that garage with me and Morehead you know.  So the next day we had a big parade and every damn thing and then we went to the ball park.  Now the kid pitching Sunday, he always liked Morehead to catch him so manager said, "Naw, so and so gon catch"--made the lineup and he saw Morehead wasn't in there, he went and questioned the manager about it.  He said "Well Al worked yesterday, give Al a day off."  Well to make a long story short, round the third inning they got us two to nothing.  And the manager said "This guy keep on riling me about they he want to bet, he want to bet."  He said, "What ya'll think about it?"  He always had a lot of respect for Morehead and myself for some reason.  "Charlie, what you-" I said, "Hell if they making the game even, we'll bet em."  He said "What do you mean," I said, "They got two runs," yeah, I said "they put up two hundred dollars, we put up a hundred and a quarter."  He went for that.  They got three more runs.  Going into the eighth inning they got us five to nothing.  We fool around there and got the bases loaded.  This old Jew boy was coming up to bat.  He took his self out of the game, Charlie go up and hit for me.  And I was lucky enough to hit a double right down the right field line, right past first base and Morehead was on first.  We made, knocked in them four runs.  Come back in the ninth and made five more.  We beat em two innings ten to five.  The last ball was hit was hit out in out field to me where I went in this Jew boy's place in right field.  I put the ball in my pocket and I hid it for the lil place where we change clothes.  When the guys got in there, I had half my clothes off, you know.  The manager come in and I threw him the ball.  He put it in the bowl.  The winning team always kept the last ball.  Now they changing next door, pretty soon here come this manager in "Give me that ball."  Morehead said "I don't have no ball."  So he come over to me, "Give me that ball."  "I don't have no damn ball, I'm naked."  "Well one of you damn niggers got that ball."  When he said that, that Jew boy got up and knocked him down.  What you say your name was?
Speaker 2: My name?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Crowe.
Speaker 1: Not a man opened their mouth, not a one said a word.  Don't do it, let him alone, Morehead--and he just took his foot and just rubbed that man's head in the concrete floor, just as bloody as a hole, nobody--Morehead pulled him off of him.  Nobody said a word.  Not a white boy said a word.  So he went next door and they got his--face stop bleeding, cleaned him up then he come back want apologize, then the manager said to him, said "Sit down there.  Now, let me tell you something, these men on this ball club is gentlemen.  If they wasn't they wouldn't be on here.  And we think a hell of a lot of them more we do of you.  I'm going to wire the league, let them know what's happening up here, if I can keep you from getting another team up here, that's what I'm gonna do.  You should of heard the man begging (unclear).  Okay, everybody got their clothes on and everything, come outside, I said to him, I said, "Get your money?" he said, "Yeah, okay."  The man's standing out there with his little boy, so we went to him and asked him how much we owe him, "you don't owe me nothing."  He said, I beat that son of a bitch out of $200.  Well, that was in 1933.  He done lost $400 in thirty minutes.  No wonder he was upset, cause back there then $400 was a hell of a lot of money.
Speaker 2: Yeah, people were getting paid like $20 a week.
Speaker 1: I never will forget that, never.  Baraboo, Wisconsin, yeah.
Story_ID: 79388
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the games.  I mean, did you-- What are the more memorable games that you played in?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  Like I said, I just got through mentioning you about two of em.  But like I--I never took a lot of pictures, it's just something I didn't want a do, like the other players, you know, people taking pic--I never got into it.  I used to kid them, I said, "Oh naw, I don't take no pictures, I got a record."  And they'd laugh and go head on, you know.  But I never took a lot of pictures or anything of that sort.  It's just something I didn't want to do.
Speaker 1: Very few photographs of yourself?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Hardly any photographs of yourself.  They're hardly any photos of you playing.
Speaker 2: I can't hear you.
Speaker 1: They're hardly any photographs of you playing ball?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't take a lot of em, like I said, I just didn't get into it.  I don't know why, but just didn't do it.  Just like we used to go into different towns and back there then we say we'll find a railroad track and we find where the colored people is, and that's true, up today, a lot of towns surrounded around them railroad tracks.  I don't know for what reason, whether it's cheaper, I don't know, but that's just the way it is.  Oh, one time, one time I was with the Hartford Giants and we went into Jefferson, Wisconsin.  And we got there on about two or three o'clock in the morning.  And pulled up on the main street, I guess you would call it and that's the highway going through there and we found a place, parked two-seven passenger cars, and each one of them seven passengers we had would carry nine, three in the front seat, three in the jump seat and three in the back, back there then.  And we pulled into this place, and everybody went and laid back and went to sleep.  And when we woke up there was a there was a--we was in front of the little bank and it was guy sittin in there with a shotgun across his--just sittin there watching us.
Story_ID: 79389
Speaker 1: This- you're in Henderson, Wisconsin, you said?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You said this is in Henderson--
Speaker 2: We stopped, Emerson, Minnesota.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Emerson, Minnesota.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's where we crossed the line into Canada.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the guy is harassing you?
Speaker 2: This wasn't at Emerson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: This is at one of them--like I said we never had a problem, racial problem, unless we was in one town or something that was close to the U.S. line, you know.  It could have been Dakota, it could have been Montana, they all join in either Manitoba [Canada] or Saskatchewan [Canada], so in them two provinces, if we were close to the line a lot of time, we had a racial problem.  And this is one of the things I was speaking about at this particu--this guy was harassing me.  I'm playing left field and he was harassing the hell out of me across the fence over there.  So I got tired of it and I went over there after him, but I was damn glad when they got to me cause I hit him with everything I had, he just kept coming, one of them big farmers.  And the Mounties, they get a kick out of it, long as you don't have no weapon, you fight all you wanted with your fist, they laughed, the Mounted police.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Quite interesting now, you know.  Especially like in my case, I had no family and nobody to worry about it wherever I was at home where I was you know.  Yep.
Story_ID: 79390
Speaker 1: Who are some of the best players you ever played with?
Speaker 2: Oh boy!  I never played with Satchel [Paige], I never played with him, but Radcliffe, "Double Duty" [HM Ted Radcliffe] and [Walter C.] "Steel Arm" Davis, but most of-[James] "Sandy" Thompson, Jack ["Boss"] Marshall--
Speaker 1: Steel Arm--who was it?
Speaker 2: --Steel Arm Davis.
Speaker 1: Steel Arm Davis?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they called him Steel Arm Davis--
Speaker 1: Got a strong arm?
Speaker 2: --Yeah, Double Duty, Jim Brown, Jack Marshall, Sandy Thompson, all those guys, yep.  Frog Hosley, Old Folks McDonald.
Speaker 1: Why did they call him Old Folks?
Speaker 2: Nick names, like they called me" Goulash," you know, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did you get the name "Goulash," you told me before we started--
Speaker 2: This restaurant.  This restaurant that this Jewish fellow had at 35th and State [Street in Chicago, Illinois], they played cards in the back, they played a lot of whist back there.  And up in front they had this steam table, and every day at eleven o'clock, he'd open up, twenty cents and it last you all day long.  And like I said a lot of old ball players, they'd get that quarter give them they'd come down there, and after they get through eaten, they'd come down to the shoe shine parlor, and they'd be there for the rest of the day, arguing, playing the games over, yeah, yeah, a lot of em, you know.
Story_ID: 79391
Speaker 1: Now, now when you were playing ball, was--you said the times were rough when the [Great] Depression hit?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And a lot of times you didn't have a place to stay--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Or couldn't get something to eat.  But that was during the off season?
Speaker 2: Yeah, like when I come back from Canada.  I come back from Canada and I couldn't--in '31' (1931)--in '30' (1930) I come back I found a little job, in '31' (1931) I come back I couldn't fine nothing to do, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Summertime was good because you get to play ball?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get a chance to go out of the country into the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No further than Canada.  I've never been--I've never been out of this country other than down to Mexico or down from--what is it--
Speaker 1: Texas?
Speaker 2: --No, Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: Tijuana?
Speaker 2: Tijuana, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, how long did you play baseball?
Speaker 2: Well, I started like I said in '23' (1923) and I played, '28' (1928) I meant to say, and around '34' (1934) somewhere along in there, I quit for a while.  I got married and I quit and went to work, grocery store and what not.  And then I started back, I think, in '37' (1937) or somewhere along in there.  And '40' (1940) when my wife [Julia Johnson] told me you better get you a job if you want to marry me, cause we didn't get married until '42' (1942).
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is your second wife?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my second wife.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 79392
Speaker 1: Did you have to join the [United States] Army?
Speaker 2: Never got in the army cause I was being deferred.  Like told you I was doing electroplating and that kept me out of the army.  Never was in 1A.  I used to make these kitchen dinette sets, chrome kitchen dinette sets you know.  I did that for a long--but during the war, I was plating shelves, stretchers, what not for the army, table legs and things that go into ships and what not, that kept me out of the army.  And after the war was over I went back to Superior Sleeprites [ph.] and worked for a while making these kitchen sets.  Then I opened up a cleaning and pressing shop.  My wife [Julia Johnson] was a milliner, she made hats, women hats, so I give her part of the store and I took part of it and I stayed with that until I went to the railroad.  When I went to the railroad--well I worked for Dormeyer, I forgot about that.  I worked for Dormeyer for a while, plating shop, where they make these mix masters and deep fryers and what not--parts.
Speaker 1: What's the name of the place again?
Speaker 2: Dormeyer.
Speaker 1: Dormeyer.
Speaker 2: Yep.  They made these small deep fryers for homes and mixmasters, the beaters and things that you--they plated you know, yep.  Used to be a shop there at 26th and Cottage Grove [Chicago, Illinois], right where Cottage Grove is cut off where the 55 highway there, it is right at the end of that, it's a building there on Cottage Grove, it used to be a plating shop in there, yeah.  I left there and went to the railroad.
Story_ID: 79393
Speaker 1: And you stayed with the railroad a long time?
Speaker 2: I went to the railroad in 1951 and '74' (1974) I quit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I went to the railroad, the only jobs that blacks had up north was red caps, train porters, cooks and waiters, track workers.  No supervision, no brakemens.  Down South they had em, but up here they didn't.  My daddy was--my wife's [Julia Johnson] daddy was a boiler maker down in Vicksburg, Mississippi.  Betty's [Betty J. Odom] father, which is my wife's uncle, is boiler maker down in Vicksburg, Mississippi, but not up here, firemans down there, not up here.
Speaker 1: What do you think the reason is for that?
Speaker 2: Well as far as the firemens' concern was the whites down South didn't want to work hard, never did.  So they didn't want to shovel that coal, so that's why the Negros was on there.  Now there's a railroad down there they call the Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad, now it is the Kansas City Southern, never had a white brakeman, had an engineer and conductor, all the brakemen was black, firemen was black.  But then after the oil burners come in, then the whites wanted them firemen jobs.  So they tried to freeze them off, some of them they tried to shoot off, some of them they shot, they shot em down there, yeah.
Speaker 1: So the black people doing these jobs were actually shot?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Them white guys--it was real remarkable to hear some of em talk about it.  One guy said his engineer told em, "I'm gonna stop down here and I'm gon get down with the oil can, and get down on the floor and don't you raise your damn head."  He said he didn't tell him why or what, just don't you raise your head.  Now these guys was down there waiting for him to stop.  So he went down there and stopped like he promise he was gon do and pretty soon he got back the engine pulled on off.  They was waiting down there to kill em.  See they couldn't belong to the union, see the F&L had it in their constitution. that you had to be of a Caucasian race to belong to the union.  People didn't know that, but it was there until 1950 something before they changed it, yeah.  But anyway that's where we came in.
Story_ID: 79394
Speaker 1: Now, you heard of A. Philip Randolph with the Pullman porters?  Okay.  He did a lot for the Pullman porters, but very little that he did for the train porters.  Now how did he get to train porters.  A group of some of the train porters on the Illinois Central Railroad in the South decided they want a unionized.  So they petitioned the F&L for a charter.  And rather than to give them a charter, they have two, Randolph was already had a charter with the Pullman.  They give to us the train porters to Randolph.  Now to try explain this to you, in the railroad you had two classified employees, operators and non-operators.  Operators consist of the people working on the trains, that is engineer, firemen, conductor, brakeman.  Non-operators' employees like dining car employee, waiters and cooks and clerks and signal form people, electricians and plumbers and different crafts, but they're non-operator.  But operators is the one to work--now where does a train porter fit in?  What was the train porter's duty, train porter's duty was to accept and discharge passengers, receive I meant to say, and discharge passengers.  He was in charge of the people on the train to see that they got off at their destination.  He assisted the conductor, help pick up the transportation, see to it that the people got off at their destination and wherever the stop, pick up, be sure to know how many you loaded so you could go and get their tickets.  Now what was he operator or non-operator?
Speaker 2: He sounds like he was an operator--
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: --If he's doing all that, he's an operator
Speaker 1: Well that was the whole point.  Randolph's organization was a non-operating organization.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Pullman Porters mainly--
Speaker 1: They was non-operators cause they had nothing to do with the train.
Speaker 2: --Yeah, they made beds.
Speaker 1: They was job was service, you know.  So therefore, like I said, whatever the railroad's company wanted to do--now you take it like the Frisco Railroad, they never had a head-in brakeman on the passenger train.  The baggage man, that was his job, not--he had nothing to do with operating, he handled the baggage, the freight and the baggage car.  So he had nothing to do with operating of the train.  But the train porter had--where ever they met on a single track, if you gonna meet here at 79th Street, somebody got to go in the siding, so the train porter get out and throw that switch, put that train into the siding, he open the switch and the flagman close it.  See what I'm saying.  But he wasn't considered as an operator.  So we brought these lawsuits and what not.  Rather than to give the train porter his entitlement, the Frisco went out of the passenger business.  But then what did they do, they had that seniority and what not so then they had to give em jobs on the freight trains, so he went back--he went to braking, he got his recognition.  All they was asking for is my recognition as a brakeman.  But the IC [Illinois Central Railroad Company], their baggage man, he was supposed to been the head brakeman, so he would get out there and throw the switch and what not.  But it was just a different situation between the North and the South.
Story_ID: 79395
Speaker 1: So anyway to make a long story short, we finally got rid of Randolph [A. Philip Randolph] as a representative for the IC [Illinois Central Railroad Company] train porters and we got this union that you saw here.  So we started to fighting that thing.  In 1965 we filed this lawsuit against em for discrimination, not promoting.  Went through the EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], we went far as we could go with the EEOC, so then we had to get an attorney and we got to--Marion Garnett, he become a judge later.  But Marion Garnett was our attorney who filed the lawsuit.  So the IC tried to get it throwed out of court, but the judge said "uh-uh, these people have been grieved."  So in five years they decided they couldn't win it so they decided they'll try to settle it.  So now you see--so what did they offer me, they first told me, when I was talking to em about the promotion, well, "Charlie, we don't have anything to offer anybody like in your category at all."  Talking about my age and what--I said, "Okay, okay."  So anyway after them five years, they saw they couldn't win it, so now they want to try to settle it, so they offered me firemen's job, uh-uh, I don't want it, offered me collectors job on a suburban, uh-uh, I don't want it.
Speaker 2: Hold it up for the camera.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  I was on it.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right, I'm sorry.  Okay, you're right.
Speaker 1: That's where I retired from.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Hold it up please?
Speaker 1: One second more.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA SPEAKER:  Great, thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.

Speaker 1: --Yes.
Speaker 2: And that's what it means.  That's what it means.  Now what we do, okay, we ride the trains--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Somebody get rowdy on there, they sell them the stuff and then they have em put in jail too, after they sell it to em.  So if we happen to run into the situation, now with the radios and things they got, tell the engineer get a hold of the dispatcher or the stationmaster at the next town when you get in range, have the police waiting there.  Police's there when you get there, take him off, put him in jail.
Speaker 1: So it's basically about the same kind of thing as the CHA police, I mean the CTA police riding the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Ride the busses?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I know the Illinois Central [Railroad Company] still has police that ride--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: --They still ride the trains or there's a police--
Speaker 2: They don't have em anymore, now they all--see the Illinois- Amtrak's got it now you see and Illinois Central they don't--I don't think it's no more Illinois Central.  I think they sold it to the Canadian National [Railway], I think.  But anyway that's where I retired from.  Now my buddy he was a fireman before promoted to engine--he got angry with me cause I wouldn't take the fireman's job.
Speaker 1: How long were you an Illinois Central Police Officer?
Speaker 2: Five years I think it was, uh-huh.  I think five or six somewhere along in there.  And the day I was becoming sixty-five, a week before I become sixty-five, I quit.  They told me one thing I had to do, I said "I'm not gonna do that, that's not police work."  Well, this is--damn that so I quit.  "Ain't nothing you can do about it."  "Well you don't need to quit," "Oh yeah," I say, "I don quit," shit.
Speaker 1: That didn't mess your retirement up or anything?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: That didn't mess--
Speaker 2: No, I was already eligible see.  I couldn't say that until I got eligible.  But like I say it was one week before I got 65, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was back in 19--
Speaker 2: Seventy-four '74' (1974).
Speaker 1: Seventy-four '74' (1974).  So you've been retired since 197--
Speaker 2: They don't owe me a damn thing do they, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 79397
Speaker 1: --Well in the '70s' (1970s) there was this resurgence in people looking at the history of the Negro leagues, the baseball leagues, that kind of started up in the '70s' (1970s), didn't it?  Before that they really didn't hear that much about it?
Speaker 2: No.  See there was not a lot of records kept.  Now Frank Young back then in those days he was sport editor for the [Chicago] Defender and they give you an illustration.  I saw a witness in argument one day out to the ball park and it was based on how many hits the pitcher gave up.  This ball player betting a fan.  So the fan said the pitcher gave up three hits, the ball player said "Now he didn't give up but two hits."  "How you gon prove this."  "The ball player he's smart, he knows."  "We'll ask Frank Young."  So they went to Frank Young there, Frank Young said "I'll put a question mark behind that plate, if they didn't get no more hits, I will go and give him some."  So what Frank Young said that was it see.  So all these so-called records and what not, cause half of the ball players couldn't score a game, half of em couldn't score a game, didn't know how to score a game.  Hell they knowed what went on but like--I couldn't score a game, I never could, and half the rest of em couldn't.  Cause see--
Speaker 1: No reliable record of what anybody--
Speaker 2: --Hell no, but you know they shoot that and like I said they don't like me too well because I tell the truth about it, you know.
Story_ID: 79398
Speaker 1: Tell me what do you think about now when you see, I mean, the current crop of baseball players and all that change--
Speaker 2: I have no ill feelings but I don't feel as though any ball player is worth a million dollars a year, not no fun game, I don't feel--it's just out of complete--out of control, but I don't envy him, but it's just out  of--completely out of control.  It's a damn fun-It's a game, it's a fun game.  But every ball pla--I think the minimum wage is almost now a million dollars.  At one time there was only a few players that made a million dollars, but now, everybody's a millionaire.
Speaker 1: Has the game changed much in terms of the way it's played actually?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's changed some.  Because like I said, it's a business.  It's not a fun game anymore, it's a business now.  It's a business with the owners, it's a business with the players.
Speaker 1: It sure seems that way.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: I mean it seems that way.  Yeah, you may be right.  A couple of years ago when Jackie Robinson's 50th anniversary in 1998--
Speaker 2: Somewhere along in there.
Speaker 1: --Him entering the Major Leagues, they asked Frank Thomas what he thought of it, and Frank Thomas said "Who is Jackie Robinson?"
Speaker 2: Yeah, they don't care.  I got the pictures, I think it's in--clippings in the paper there.  We was at this March of Dimes right there, Johnny and myself and some of the old players there and Johnny went and got Frank to come over and say "hello" to us, and he spoke one or two, I gotta go, I'm gone.  They don't care, they don't know and they don't care.
Speaker 1: I think those were his exact words.  Somebody said well you don't know who Jackie Robinson was, he said "Well I don't know and I don't care."
Speaker 2: That's right.  They don't know.
Story_ID: 79399
Speaker 1: Now I got a article in the paper there, clipping in that drawer there now wherein that this guy is writing about the little pension that some of the players are getting.
Speaker 2: That's a pension through Major League Baseball?
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Now [HM] Carol Moseley Braun during her term as senator, she goes to [Jerry] Reinsdorf, the owner of the White Sox, and Bud Selig, which is now commissioner, was the owner of the Milwaukee Brewers at that time, to talk about giving us a little type of pension.  So when they put it before the team owners nobody want to touch it.  Put it before the baseball union, nobody want to touch it.  So Bud Selig said well hell, we'll do it ourselves.  Now as Johnny says and I agree with him, when it come down to who's  entitled and who's not, I think according to the count down in Kansas City [Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri], round two hundred and, not quite two hundred and fifty of us living now.  Now they got a so-called union.  The president's up there in Manassas, Virginia, right out of Washington, and I asked him "Who submitted the list of names for the eligibility of the players to Reinsdorf and whoever's handling it," he said "I don't know."  "Well, somebody did.  You president of the so-called union and you don't know?  When you keep a count of every member that's eligible, you wrote me and wanted to know some questions before you recognized my eligibility."  I don't know.  Now Joe Black, Monte Irvin, Monte Irvin works for the commissioner out of the commissioner's office, they set up a ruling that you had to have four, I believe it's four years, consecutive employment in the league to be eligible.  Consecutive now, which means you might have been there five years on and off, like myself.  Therefore the majority of the players don't receive it.  Now I got an article in that paper now wherein that this senator down in Florida says this session of congress he's gonna take it up because there's a hundred and fifty players that are not getting this pension, and at $10,000 a year, that's just a drop in the bucket to Major League Baseball, and they claim they can't find some extra money to give to these other hundred and fifty players.  Well like Johnny said they could have pro-rate, said well if you been there two years, we'll give you $5000 a year you know.  Whatever the majority of us out here is still struggling.  I'm not struggling to--I'm existing, I'm not rich you know, but I'm living.  But it's a lot of em is not well off as I am because they didn't work.  Take like [HM Ted] Radcliffe down there, he ain't never had a job in his life, "Double Duty," never worked.  So he's struggling, yeah.  So now what's gonna happen now, I don't know, but Jim--the commissioner before Selig.
Speaker 2: [A. Bartlett] Bart Giamatti, yeah?
Speaker 1: He is writing a book and two months ago, I'll bet it's two months about now, he sent everybody a check from the royal(ph) of this book.  And he says he contribute the whole amount to the old Negro players.
Story_ID: 79400
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community nowadays?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community these days?
Speaker 2: Black community?
Speaker 1: Yes, Sir.
Speaker 2: I'm lost.  As Betty [Betty J. Odom] said "It's too many tribes."  I don't under--I don't know what's gonna happen. I know one thing, my ther--it's a theory, maybe I'm right and maybe I'm wrong, I don't know, but for some reason everybody can join together but us.  And that got to be a reason for that.  We cannot partnership, we cannot do things together, we don't want to follow, everybody want to lead, and it's got to be some followers.  I don't know what's gon happen tell you the truth, I really don't.  I think about it and I wonder about it but I just don't know as far as the community, I don't know.  And it's something to think about.  You take the African countries, they all starving, why, why?  When the English, the Dutch and whoever supposed to been over em turned them loose, they starving, why? I don't know.  They talk about the churches.  All the minister is interested in is building the largest building they can build, pastor, so many, so many.  My wife [Julia Johnson] was a very church-working woman, she believed in the church, she was raised up like that, she still continued to believe in it.  And as long as she was living, she contributed.  The assistant pastor would come out, now she belonged to Quinn Chapel [A.M.E. Church in Chicago, Illinois].  The assistant pastor would come out, give her communion and take the check.  The Pastor never put his foot in here after [Thomas M] Higginbotham was the pastor when she died.  She told me "If I pass away, I don't want that man looking down on my body.  I don't want him saying nothing over me, cause he doesn't know me, he doesn't know what to say."  And when she passed I told the assistant pastor she wanted him to preach at her funeral.  Him and the pastor got into an argument over who's gon collect the fifty dollars.  Here what I say.  Now they gon charge her, she contributed ten percent of her earnings every month and they gon charge, be fifty dollars to preach her funeral, talking about a courtesy contribution, shit, uh-uh, no.  So I don't know, I really don't know.  I do not know, I don't know what's gonna happen, cause the young people don't seem to care one way or the other.
Story_ID: 79401
Speaker 1: What would be your advice for young people these days, what would you like to see them do that's different, developmental?
Speaker 2: I would first like to see them respect the law, cause that's one thing they don't want to do.  They just feel as though they can do whatever they want to do.  They don't care.  That's why so many of em in jail cause they don't care.  They don't even--a lot of em don't even care about a life.  I don't know, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Do you ever have occasion to talk to young black athletes?  Did you ever talk to school groups?
Speaker 2: Well when I started to try all I could hear was bad language.  And they don't think nothing about it, and I don't like to hear it.  It's one word that I really don't like to hear and that seem to be a everyday word with them, "motherfucker."  When they open their mouth that's what they come out with.  College kids, uh-uh, I don't know.  But society is trying to tell you what you should or what you shouldn't do and I'll give you one illustration.  22nd and Wentworth [Chinatown, Chicago, Illinois], whatever goes on over there stays over there, Chinese.  You never hear about a Chinese being arrested or in jail, you never hear that, why, why?  They take care whatever the situation is.  Not us though, see we're trying to tell what you can't do to your child and the child tell you, "You hit me I'll sue you" cause he's been told that he can sue, and if you haven't had the experience how the hell you gonna tell somebody else not to do something when you don't know what the hell you're talking about.  And that's what's going on today.  And it's gotten completely out of control now.
Story_ID: 79402
Speaker 1: Sir, did your father and aunt get a chance to see you play ball?
Speaker 2: My father?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Like I told you I never seen him.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's right, but your aunt?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Your aunt?
Speaker 2: My aunt?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I never had a aunt
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Grandmother, mother and uncle.
Speaker 1: And your stepfather and mother--
Speaker 2: Stepfather.
Speaker 1: --Did they see you play?
Speaker 2: No.  He knew, my stepfather knew that I started to playing baseball but he got completely out of control.  I had to bury him when he died, I had to bury him.  He had a nephew here that I told you when I was young I stayed with and others, nobody come to rescue, I had to bury him.  Never--people that he was living with come and told me that he had stopped paying his insurance and what not so he didn't have any insurance or anything.  So I had to bury him when he died.  I'd a let em burn him up don't be for my wife [Julia Johnson]. Of course like I said he told me to you know finish.  She said "No you don't do that."  Yeah.
Story_ID: 79403
Speaker 1: Tell me what would you consider as your legacy? What would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't know, really don't know, never thought about it.  Like I said, you know I never was looking for publicity or anything of that sort.  And that's why Nancy was so surprised when Betty [Betty J. Odom] told her said yeah, Charlie played along with [HM Ted] Radcliffe, "Double Duty," and them.  "What?"  "Yeah, yeah."  Said "Well how come he--said he don't want to be bothered with em," which I didn't.  Like I said, my wife [Julia Johnson] said get rid of that stuff and I just threw it all out here one day, in the garbage, shoes, I had a couple of uniforms you know.  Guys (unclear) kept the uniform you know, gloves and things all that stuff and few papers--few records you know, just throwed it in the garbage can cause I didn't think I was gon to amount to any--and that one picture there that's over there that I kept that I showed you, I kept that one picture, that's all I have.  And this picture here, never would have had it if it hadn't been for that fellow up there in Three Rivers, Michigan tell me about the folks that had the pictures up there.  I never would have had it.  Now he lives in Chicago [Illinois] here, but his daughter lives up there in Three Rivers, see.  And his daughter died here recently so they still got the place.  Talked to him the other day, they still got the place up there and everything but they live here, him and his wife.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Wallace, lives at, what is it 92nd or 94th and--no, 96th I meant to say, 96th and King Drive.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well, Sir, how do you stay young.  You're like 93?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You're 93 years old?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You seem to stay pretty upbeat. You know, for somebody who's 93.  How do you manage to do that?
Speaker 2: I got a young woman called me a while ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She 47.
Story_ID: 79404
Speaker 1: Sir, now this is a-  you're still very lively apparently.  But, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Never thought about it, never thought about it.  I might have a different view point of life than maybe a lot of people because I come up alone.  And some people say when I tell em these things, I cannot agree with the wrong doer regardless of the circumstances.  Like I hear people say "I got to do whatever is necessary to survive, whatever it is."  I don't see it that way.  But then as I told her no longer than yesterday you got to think what is best for me.  Damn what Sam say, Junior say, Henry say, mother say, brother say, sister say, what is best for me, am I right or wrong?
Speaker 1: It sounds right to me.
Speaker 2: What is best for me and you do that.  What's best for me.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you'd like to be remembered as someone who thinks for himself?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: So you'd like to be remembered as someone who thinks for himself?
Speaker 2: Someone who what?
Speaker 1: You'd like to be remembered as somebody who thinks for himself?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 79405
Speaker 1: Now I have a, not say a problem, but I'm beginning to feel lonesome and I also begin to feel as though I need somebody around me, I need to be around somebody, not alone.  Now one morning better than a year ago now about one o'clock in the morning, I was laying back in my bed back there sleep and the light went on, and I turned over and there's a guy sitting in a chair next to my bed.  Now how he get in the house?  When I looked at this, "am I dreaming," you understand what I'm say--what am I seeing here.  He said to me--I said "Who are you, how did you get in here?" "You left the door opened.  What's wrong with your eyes man, are you sick or something?"  And I said, "Yeah."  Now I--he's small fellow but now I don't know what he got, I don't know whether he gon harm me or what.  So I sit there for a second or two, I said "I gotta pee," and I jumped up, went to the bathroom like I was going to the bathroom and I come--my gun is in the drawer there in that cabinet.  And I opened the drawer and I put my hand on the gun and something said to me just like I'm talking to you, "Uh-uh, Charlie don't do it."  I put the gun back down.  Now he's gone in my pants pocket laying up there and got my wallet out and got my--some paper money I had in my pocket.  I gets a butcher knife out of the kitchen and I gets after him with it and he started doing the judo, kicking and he got away from me.  Now how he get in here, okay.  See that air condition there, can you see it from this window, behind that curtain there.
Speaker 2: Yes, Sir.
Speaker 1: He tried to get that air condi--push that air condition out of the window.  What he did he went in the alley and got the garbage container and that's what he climbed up on to try to push that air--and he couldn't get the air condition out.  So he come around to the front and I had the screen that's at the bottom now I had it at the top and he pushed that screen up enough, pried it up and I had left the key in the lock and that's how he got in there.  So don't think about it every night that I go to bed, I think about that.
Story_ID: 79406
Speaker 1: Now what am I going to do?  I don't know.  That little girl up there in the corner, that light-skinned one, she lives in Vacaville, California, and she's a distant relative for my wife [Julia Johnson] and she's married, two children, she married a Puerto Rican boy, very nice fellow.  Now they begging me to come out there.  Sell the place and come out there and stay with us.  The president of that picture there, that engineer, his wife down in Georgia, before he died he was pleading with me to come down there.  She's still saying to me "I got plenty of room if you want to come down here" or if you want me to--see when I was down there a couple of years ago, she took me around to the senior citizens places.  Cause at first I told her--they got twenty-five acres, two fishing ponds on there, they got pear trees, pecan tree so (unclear).  Now he passed away.  So she's there by herself, talked to her no longer than the other day.  "Charlie, why don't you just sell that place, come on down here."  We sat out on the pond and fish, and I laugh.  I don't know.  I don't know what I'll do, but I'm little restless right now.  And it's something to think about.  I got to put it together, you know.  Now Betty [Betty J. Odom] lives alone.  I told her sometime ago, several years ago, she was saying to me about maybe I should sell this place and get a smaller place, senior citizen something and I said to her, "I said you know, how bout me moving down there where your uncle used to stay."  I said, "I'll just sell it and move in there, when I can leave when I get ready and go visit and--I don't want nobody living with me."  She lives alone.  So I don't even let my daughter live with me.  Well, ain't no need to saying no more to her is it, no.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: Well there are some options, I guess.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: I guess you do have some options?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have some options if I want to put it together, but then you stop and think as the old folks used to say, "It's no better place than home."  This is mine.  I don't owe nobody nothing on it and haven't for years.  If I move into a senior citizen, I got to adjust to people up over, people underneath me, people on--what I can do and what I can't do.  If I want a put a nail up there, I put it up there.
Speaker 2: And we can still interview you whenever we are ready.
Speaker 1: So it's something to think about, you know.  I don't know.
Speaker 2: We're almost at the end of the roll.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: We're almost at the end of this.  I want to thank you.
Speaker 1: So I don't know.
