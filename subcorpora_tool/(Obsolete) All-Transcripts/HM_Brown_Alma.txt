Story_ID: 4081
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you about your family history.  I want to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side of the family.  But I'll begin by asking you to give me your parents' full names and to spell them for me.
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Dorothy Ann Arrington.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father's name was Martin Luther Arrington.
Speaker 1: Okay, now can you give us your mother's date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I have--she's in her eighties.  I'm not quite sure.  She's a May--she has a May birthday.  I'm not sure exactly what it is.  And my father passed in 1986, and he was eighty-two at the time, I knew that.  And--.
Speaker 1: So that makes him 1904, I guess.
Speaker 2: I guess, somewhere around there.  He was born in Martinsburg, West Virginia.  And my mother was born in Brooklyn, New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: In terms of my knowing the people or having heard about them?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Not knowing the people, knowing about the family, not--you know, some you might know, but--. The first question was how far back can you trace?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I can go back to my--I guess my great-grandmother on my mother's side.  On my father's side I can just go back to my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, are there any stories passed down through the family about, you know, what your ancestors were doing?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, on my mother's side, my grand--my great-grandfather was white and was a blacksmith and he married my great-grandmother.  And he was run out of town because he married a woman of color at that time.
Speaker 1: Was this in New York?
Speaker 2: This was in Greenville, South Carolina and--where my grand--where my grandmother is from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's the big story with--with them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he--did he then move to New York or--.
Speaker 2: No, I think he was killed and my--my great-grandmother stayed in South Carolina.  And my grandmother moved to New York when she was sixteen and met my grandfather and got married.  And she never worked a day in her life, and just kept--she was a homemaker in Brooklyn [New York].
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now, this was the latter part of the nineteenth century, I guess, in the 1870's or '80's [1880s]?
Speaker 2: I guess.  And she was always at home.  I just remember her always being at home.
Speaker 1: What did your grandfather do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a cook, a chef, and a custodian of brownstones in downtown Brooklyn, Brooklyn Heights [New York].  He had about ten buildings that he was responsible for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, any other stories about your mother's side of the family--.
Speaker 2: My grandfather was quite a bit older than my grandmother.  My father was quite a bit older than my mother.  I didn't find that out until my father died.  No, that's--that's probably--in terms of him being run out of town, my great-grandfather, that's the one story that kept being repeated and repeated, you know.
Speaker 1: So he was killed in South Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was killed by, I guess, the townsmen who were angry with him for marrying my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: So he actually found somebody to marry them, you know, perform a ceremony and all that?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, they were married.  Who married them, I don't know. But they were married.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) This would have been--that would have had to have taken place around the time of the [United States] Civil War or shortly thereafter, I would guess.  That's--.
Speaker 2: As in most cases, you know, you don't--I mean that story was told to me any number of times, but I never--I thought my grandmother would live forever.  She died when she was ninety-eight.  And I didn't get to get all the answers, get all my questions answered.  A lot of things I missed getting from her, recipes, 'cause she was quite a cook.  And I often think now how many things she made that I wish I knew how to make.  But I never sat down with her and wrote--wrote everything out.  I watched her, but I didn't really get the ingredients and so forth.
Speaker 1: Well, that period of time in South Carolina, right after the Civil War, a number of black people held public office and the situation had kind of flipped for black people.  They--they could do a lot of things they couldn't do prior to the Civil War.  But after 1876, things started to decline and the South basically reinstated itself in the--in the Union, I guess and began to take back these things, the rise of the Klan [Ku Klux Klan], the black militias folded up and so I guess a lot of relationships, you know, switched.  You know, so he may have married her in the time when it was--he thought it might be okay going forward to (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: Possibly.
Speaker 1: And then, you know, things changed rapidly down there, and it got--it got worse than it was, in some respects than it was before the war.  So that's a--that's a--it'd be interesting to find out what the details of that story really are.  But, okay, now, what about your father's side?  How far back can you trace him?
Speaker 2: Just to my grandmother.  His--his mother.  I never knew his father.  And he had a lot of brothers and sisters, nine or something like that.  It seemed like a lot to me 'cause I'm an only child.  And my mother is an only child.  Excuse me. And my father had a lot of brothers and sisters.  And my grandmother was alone when I met her, so--when I got to know her.  So--and I have no idea when my grandfather died.  So I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you grandmother continue to live in Martinsburg?  Was she--.
Speaker 2: No, she moved to Brooklyn.
Story_ID: 4082
Speaker 1: Well tell us about your mother [Dorothy Ann Arrington].  Now, your mother's still living, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right. Now, what kind of life did she have in Brooklyn [New York]?
Speaker 2: She has a very interesting life.  She's a retired school teacher.  She taught in New York City public schools for fifty years, I guess or whatever.  And she ended up being a supervisor of early childhood education teachers.  She retired at that stage in her life.  She loved teaching.  Still, to this day is very interested in education and so forth.  She was in our house that I grew up in.  And we finally talked her into moving, selling the house.  And I bought her a condominium in downtown Brooklyn where she wanted to go, an area that's across from the library [the Brooklyn Public Library] and the Brooklyn Museum and the [The New York] Botanical Gardens [sic, Garden], around Grand Army Plaza.
Speaker 1: That's a great location--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And she's so happy there.  She loves it.  And she's on the sixteenth floor with a terrace that looks out over all of her favorite places because she's on the boards of the museum and the library and the botanical gardens.  And she's an artist now.  And so she has, she has a great time.  And she has two friends in the building--in her building.  It's not a seniors building.  It's a very diverse building.  And--but she happens to have two friends that live in the building.  So they get together and play bridge and so forth.  They get their fourth person somewhere, and they play bridge.  She's a big bridge player.  And she's--she belongs to a bridge group and they meet every week and play bridge at different people's houses.  So she has that to do, and then she has another little group that she goes to the theater with on Wednesday afternoons. Then she has her things at the library and the museum and botanical gardens and so forth.  So she keeps busy.  And she comes out to Sag Harbor [New York].
Speaker 1: Now, was she the first person in her family to go to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, first and only.  She's an only child and she went to NYU [New York University, New York City, New York] and went to--undergrad--and went to NYU graduate school as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, tell us about your father [Martin Luther Arrington], you know.  What was he like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: Oh, he was wonderful.  He was a supervisor of public housing.  He had about four buildings that he supervised.  In terms--I guess he was the manager, for lack of a better term, of New York City public housing.  And he went to West Virginia State [College, Institute, West Virginia].  And at that time, when he went there, it was all black.  Now, it's, of course, quite integrated and available to--to everyone.  He was just the sweetest man.  I--I can't say anything other than that description of him in terms of just--just a lovely man.
Story_ID: 4083
Speaker 1: Tell me about growing up.  Now, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: I grew up in what was known then as Bedford-Stuyvesant, 'Bed-Sty' [Brooklyn, New York] as we called it--but it's--well people called it 'Bed-Sty.'  I didn't call it that.  It was just my neighborhood.  And it was a wonderful neighborhood.  I mean, there were some gangs or whatever, but they didn't bother me.  They were fine with me.  And they--I remember some times coming home and walking down the street, and there'd be a group of guys on the corner.  And one time I remember they said, "Oh Alma, don't worry, we're not gonna bother you or your friends."  So I never understood what that meant, but I just said, "Thank you, Lil' Bo and Big Joe," and whatever their names were.  But I kind of, you know, went in and out and nobody ever bothered me.  And you--you, you know, you heard about stories about kids getting beaten up on their block and in their neighborhood, but I never had that problem.  So--and we had what was then, I guess, one of the nicest houses on our street because my grandfather was big with the garden and the yard.  And he always had flowers planted and he would always be in the yard fiddling with his roses and different things.  And people would always stop and comment about our yard and how pretty it looked.  And we had a porch, and outside furniture, and we had an awning that we put, you know, put up and down, a canvas awning,  I remember that.  And we lived in a two-family house.  My grandmother and grandfather lived downstairs.  And my mother [Dorothy Ann Arrington], my father [Martin Luther Arrington] and myself lived upstairs.  And that's--I grew up there.  And then we moved to another house when I went away to college [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].  That was in--at that time, it was a nice, supposed to be the nice neighborhood, Crown Heights [Brooklyn], which is now like Bed-Sty was, what people call 'Bed-Sty.'  And that was a great house.  That was a two-family house as well.  And we lived upstairs and my grandparents lived downstairs.  And that was a corner house, and we had a garage, two car garage for my--our car and my grandparents' car.  And we had Sunday dinner with my grandparents.  Every Sunday we would come downstairs for dinner.  And on Thursdays, they would come upstairs to have dinner with us.  That was our little ritual.  And then on Friday nights, my mother, my father and I would do something together.  We'd either go roller skating, ice skating, to the movies and go to dinner.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was our three--that was what the three of us did on Fridays.
Speaker 1: Okay. I guess, what--what were your favorite activities growing up when you were (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: At what age?
Speaker 1: Well, when you were a little kid.
Speaker 2: Playing with my dolls and dollhouse and stuff.  And then I was an only child.  I always wanted friends to come over to play.  And if friends couldn't come over to play, for whatever reason, their mothers wouldn't let them come or it was raining, whatever, I was fine.  I could, I learned how to play by myself with my dolls and I loved to read, and I'd read and just--I guess reading was probably my favorite--the favorite thing I loved--liked to do and I still do.
Story_ID: 4084
Speaker 1: Now what schools did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to PS [Public School] 83.
Speaker 1: Was this in Bed-Sty [Brooklyn, New York], PS 83?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Then I went--that went to the sixth grade.  Then I went to PS 167 [Parkway School, Brooklyn, New York].  That was in the other neighborhood, Crown Heights [Brooklyn].  Then I went to [Samuel J.] Tilden High School [Brooklyn] for a little while and then transferred to a private school, Boro Hall Academy [Brooklyn], and that's where I graduated from.
Speaker 1: It's called Burr Hall?
Speaker 2: Boro, B-O-R-O, Hall Academy.  I don't know if it's still in existence.  It's downtown Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well tell us about school in Brooklyn (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The one thing I remember about PS 83 was my favorite teacher--was my--either my sixth grade.  She was--I think she was my sixth grade teacher.  She was a black teacher, Mrs. Farrar.  And that's what I remember about PS 83.  [PS] 167, I remember my teacher--the teacher that had the most--made the most impression on me was a Mrs. Scanlon.  She was--she was a white teacher, but I liked her very much.  And I had my last physical fight in eighth grade at that school.
Speaker 1: Did you have a lot of physical fights?
Speaker 2: No, that's the one I remember the most.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have to fight a lot coming up, growing up or did you have to be prepared for that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: I knew how to fight.  I mean, I wasn't, you know, of such the goody two shoes, that I didn't know how.  But I--I was timid.  I'm a timid person by nature, so I didn't like to fight, but if I had to, I did.  And I remember this girl and I were standing in line.  And the reason I remember this so vividly is because I just saw her this summer.  And I hadn't seen her in, I don't know, forty years or whatever.  And we were very good friends in school.  We were in eighth grade, and we were the same height.  And you know how they line you up in size places.  And we were on our way to assembly.  And the--we were lined up to go out of the door, and the teacher said she had to go to the ladies room.  This is that Mrs. Scanlon.  And she left the room and something, I don't know what happened,  but either Gwendolyn pushed me or I pushed her--.
Speaker 1: (Phone rings)
Speaker 2: What do you want me to do?
Speaker 1: We're going to pause.
Speaker 2: (Off camera voices)
Speaker 1: Anyway, yes. We resume. So you and your friend were standing in line, Mrs. Scanlon went to the washroom--.
Speaker 2: Right, she went to the (unclear).  And either she pushed me or I pushed her. We don't remember who did what to whom first.  And we started fighting.  That kind of like, you know, (imitates clawing) fighting, pulling hair and whatever you do.
Speaker 1: You were friends, you weren't angry at each other?
Speaker 2: I don't--we don't know to this day what started it.  It had to have been a push or something. And we just--we don't know.  And somebody yelled "Teacher's coming, teacher's coming!"  And we got back in line and stood just as straight.  And at the end of the day, we went off together like we normally do to go home and never even mentioned it again.  So we don't know what prompted that, but we were like very good friends at school.  So that was my last fight.  That's why I remember 167 so well.  Plus, when I came back to New York [City, New York] from Germany and wanted to resume my teaching, I got my job at P.S. 167, where I had been a student.  So that had a special little--special feeling for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So in grade school,  were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in things like reading and I wasn't good in arithmetic.  At that time, we called it arithmetic.  Now, they call it math or something.  But--in reading, I was excellent.  Read--all the things related to reading, whether it was history or anything you had to read.  Numbers, I had--have always had a problem with.
Story_ID: 4085
Speaker 1: What were your favorite books when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh, God.
Speaker 1: Or favorite stories?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: I liked all of the Jane Austen, you know, I was from that era.  I loved all that.  And I loved--I think I read 'Little Women' [Louisa May Alcott] maybe forty times.  I liked the 'Diary of Anne Frank' [Anne Frank]; I enjoyed that.  But then again, I liked--I remember 'Souls of Black Folks' [sic, 'Souls of Black Folk,' W.E.B. DuBois], but that was later on.  But in school--in grade school and high school, those were--well, we didn't have anything else to read.  So we had to read Jane Austen, things of that nature.  It wasn't until I got in college [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] that we really got exposed to black literature.  I didn't get any prior to that.
Speaker 1: So the demographics of--you said--I'm trying to--and your neighborhood was mostly black, I take it?
Speaker 2: No, it was very--it was mixed.
Speaker 1: Mixed, okay.
Speaker 2: New York [City, New York] was quite mixed.  And everybody went to the public schools and, you know, you played with--you went outside and played with whoever was outside, you know.  So--.
Speaker 1: So your neighborhood didn't have a predominance of any (unclear).
Speaker 2: I would say it probably had a predominance of maybe black and Italian, maybe. I guess, maybe that would be the two.  But then in school, I had a--a lot of Jewish kids.  When--once I got to [PS, Public School] 167 [The Parkway School, Brooklyn, New York].  At [PS] 83 [Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York], I think it was like black and Italian kids.  I don't remember much about that school other than my favorite teacher, Mrs. Farrar.  But 167, it was very mixed and a lot of Jewish kids.
Story_ID: 4086
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about high school. What did you do in high school?
Speaker 2: Well, I went to [Samuel J.] Tilden [High School, Brooklyn, New York] for a while, and then my mother [Dorothy Ann Arrington] transferred me out and sent me to Boro Hall Academy [Brooklyn, New York], private school.
Speaker 1: How long did you spend at Tilden?
Speaker 2: I think I was there about two years, and it was overcrowded.  That was when the New York City public schools were--were on triple session.  You could go to school from seven to noon or from ten to three or from one to five or something like that.  And I was on one of those sessions.  You almost had to share books and your desk wasn't your own.  You know, you had to share a desk.  It was just--it was awful.  And so when it came to the sharing of the books, my mother said, "That's it.  You're getting out of there."  So she sent me to Boro Hall Academy 'cause it was--she checked out and found that that was small, with small classes and so forth and so on.  And so that's where I ended up.
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about Boro Hall Academy.  Was it a school founded by some religious denomination?
Speaker 2: No, it was just a small, independent school back then that just catered to the needs of--of families.  And it was not an elitist school nor was it a inner-city kind of school.  It was just an independent school.
Speaker 1: Was it felt in those days that the public school system was just over-saturated with students?
Speaker 2: By some parents,  yeah.  I mean, my mother was very aware of it because she was in the system, 'cause she was teaching.  And so she knew how awful the schools were.  Now, some, you know, if--if a child did not go home and tell their parents and the--or the parent didn't know what it was like, you know, the child could always say, well, "I don't have any books," which was really true.  You know, "I don't have a book to do my homework.  That's why I don't have homework."  You know, but my mother, I could not get away with that with her.  She would stay on me about stuff, so I couldn't do that with her.  And when she--she would come, come to visit the school and she saw for herself what was going on.  And she said, no, you can't be in an environment like this.  And this was one of the bigger, larger public schools in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: And Brooklyn in those days, and it still is today, I guess the most densely populated place in the United States. Six million people, twice as big as Chicago [Illinois] in terms of population (unclear) dense. So that was a--school crowding was a big problem.
Speaker 2: And I guess it was important too 'cause I was getting ready to graduate and at Boro Hall, the--everybody took an interest in--in your--in the students.  From the principal--oh, I guess he was the headmaster--to your teachers, your guidance counselor, I mean--and so when it came time to write letters of recommendation for the schools and everything that I was applying to, they were great.  Whereas at Tilden, you would have to get on a long list and wait until the counselor could get to you to write, you know, write for--write your letters and to see what you were interested in.  Oh, it was just--I don't know how some of those kids got out of there and got into a college of their choice, you know.  But that was a very--that was a large, large, large school, a lot of students, and predominantly white, Tilden was.  Where I went--the private school was as well, but they just took more of an interest in you.
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers that--.
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  I don't remember a name. I only remember two teachers, a Mrs. Scanlon in eighth grade and a Mrs. Farrar in sixth grade in my whole school--school life  (laughs). I remember what one teacher looked like at Boro Hall Academy, but I don't remember the name.
Story_ID: 4087
Speaker 1: Before we go any further, would you like to tell us what happened to your hand?
Speaker 2: Oh, I broke my finger.  I fell and broke my finger, and I had surgery June 30 [2003], and I've been in a cast since then.  Hopefully, it'll be coming off some time in October.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  We just wondered.  Okay, now high school.  You said you didn't really remember any of the teachers that well, but what activities were you involved in in high school?  Did you--were you a active student--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, I wasn't involved.  No. Not at all.  I went to school, did what I had to do and came home to be with my friends and go to parties.  And that's what I did on the weekends.
Speaker 1: Okay, no cheerleading.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No running for class office.
Speaker 2: No, I didn't do any of that.  I wasn't in--I don't think I was in any clubs.  I might have been in the French club in high school.  But it was so large that--at that [Samuel J.] Tilden [High] School [Brooklyn, New York] and at the--my other high school [Boro Hall Academy, Brooklyn], I don't remember being a part of--I might have been in the club, but I don't remember it 'cause I was a pretty good French language person.  So--.
Speaker 1: Were you involved in athletics at all?
Speaker 2: No. I played whatever I had to do in gym, played volleyball and things like that, but only because you had gym for an hour a day and that's what you did, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how were your grades?  Were you a real--.
Speaker 2: In my--anything related to reading was fine.  Math--arithmetic, as we called it then, I was always struggling with  (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were on the verge of graduating from high school, what did you--what did you see as your future?  Did you have a career in mind?
Speaker 2: Teaching, only because my mother [Dorothy Ann Arrington] was a teacher and she basically told me that's what I was gonna be doing.  And I grew up thinking I was going to be a teacher.  I was gonna graduate from high school, go to college, become a teacher, get married, and have children, 'cause that's what my mother said you do.  So, that's kind of what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay. So you graduated from Boro Hall Academy in what, '58 [1958]?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Story_ID: 4088
Speaker 1: Now how did you decide to go to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanted to go to a black school.  The only two my parents would consider was Howard [University, Washington, DC] and Fisk.  And the reason they chose Howard and Fisk was because they were the only two schools that had Ph.D. [Doctor of Philosophy] programs, like I was gonna be in a Ph.D. program.  But they wanted me to have that experience and to be in an environment where that was possible.  And my mother then decided that Howard--I had too many friends at Howard and--or that were going to Howard, and I wouldn't do my school work.  So that's how we ended up with Fisk.  And I loved Fisk from the first day I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, Fisk is in Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 2: Nashville, Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay. So who were some of the personalities at Fisk then?
Speaker 2: John Hope Franklin.
Speaker 1: That's before he went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Lawson, Dr. Lawson.
Speaker 1: James Lawson?
Speaker 2: Jim Lawson. I think he's passed now.
Speaker 1: No, he's out in California.  He's a pastor out in California.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, not that Lawson.
Speaker 1: Oh, the other--another Lawson.
Speaker 2: He was head of the chemistry department.  Oh, I know you're talking about Jim Lawson--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Reverend James Lawson.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, they were all there, him and Jim Bevel [activist/pastor] and Diane--Bevel married Diane somebody, I can't think of her name.
Speaker 1: Nash [Diane Nash Bevel, civil rights activist]. Nash.
Speaker 2: Nash, right, right.  Nikki Giovanni [poet/professor] was there.  Marion Barry [Washington DC mayor] was in graduate school there.  Julius Lester [writer/professor].
Speaker 1: Julius Lester was there too?  Yeah, the writer and--.
Speaker 2: The writer.  He was in graduate school.  Who are some of the other names?  We had an exchange program with Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] and a college in California.  I can't think of the name of the one in California.  But Oberlin sent a lot of name people.  And I can't remember the school in California.  And that was--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Was D'Army Bailey [activist/attorney] there too, D'Army Bailey?  I think he was--he may have been there.
Speaker 2: Probably, the name isn't--.
Speaker 1: 'Cause he's from--. Okay.
Story_ID: 4089
Speaker 1: And that was all--during all the sit-ins and everything was going on then.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, yeah, so you were--you got there [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] in '58 [1958], and the sit-in movement started, I guess, around 1960 or '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: No, it started earlier.  It started in the '50s [1950s] at AT&T [sic, A&T, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina]  was the first one, which was I think in '50 [1950]--it was early.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: It was very early, and--. I don't remember what year, but I know it was--it was the first one, AT&T.
Speaker 2: I believe that was '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.  I think--somehow I thought it was earlier than that, but I'm not sure.  You--you probably know more than I do.
Speaker 2: So, were you involved in the sit-in movement at Fisk?
Speaker 1: Not really, because I was a timid person.  And they used to tell us, "If you're going to cry, we don't need you to come out and march.  If you're going to cry or if you're going to want to fight back, you know, somebody says something to you, we don't want you to participate.  You stay at school and get sandwiches ready for everybody when they come back and have the water and cool drink and stuff.  You don't need to come, you know, if you're going to do one of the two things."  Well, I knew I would cry.  I wasn't gonna fight anybody.  I would cry if somebody said something to me.  So I didn't go.  And--on any of them and--except for one,  I went.  And I'll never forget this one.  I can't remember--we marched downtown [Nashville, Tennessee].  And it was cold.  And I wore--I had a black cashmere coat, and I wore my coat.  And for some strange reason, I--this was my first march and my picture was taken on the--in the--some how the guy took my picture from 'Newsweek,' and I'm on the cover of 'Newsweek,' me who's the most timid at the school.  And my mother [Dorothy Ann Arrington] called me that night.  And she said, "What are you doing downtown in your good coat with those crazy white folks."  (Laughs)  I fell out laughing.  I said, "Don't worry.  I won't be back."  I said, "They were throwing stuff and everything."  And so she said, "Don't you fool around with those crazy white people."  So I didn't go back 'cause I didn't like that--that I was scared to death.  And I'm trying to think who made me go.  I think some--a friend of mine said, "Come on, everybody's going, everybody's going, including the guys across the street."  We called across the street Meharry [Medical College, Nashville Tennessee].  "Everybody's gonna go, you have to go, you have to go."  So I got myself together and went and I was a nervous wreck the whole time I was down on that march. Oh, so finally we got back and I was just glad I got back safely,  but my mother was so funny.  And that was my one experience marching.  So I stayed at school after that. I stayed at school prior to that one time, and then after that one time.

Speaker 1: Now, what about some of the personalities you've--you've mentioned?  Did you have classes [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] from John Hope Franklin?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My dad [Martin Luther Arrington] knew him because they were both Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated] together.  And my father knew him.  And I did take the Race Relations Institute [Fisk University discussion forum] one summer, which was fabulous, and he was one of the instructors through that.  He was terrific.  Absolutely wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay. Any other teachers there that kind of stood out?  You said there was a Dr. Lawson?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was the--in the chemistry department.  Dr. Bontemps, he was the librarian.
Speaker 1: Arna Bontemps, right.
Speaker 2: My French teacher. I don't want to mess up his name so I'd better not put it in there 'cause I'm not sure, because he pronounced it--it was like a regular name, let's say like Johnson.  But he pronounced it like Monsieur Johnson (with French accent) or something like that.  And that's how he wanted to--we had to go in class, and I was very good in French.  And in my freshman year, you know how you take the entrance exams.  And I scored very well so they put me in advanced French.  I didn't have to take freshman French or whatever it's called.  And the class I--I was in, you spoke French from the time you went into the classroom 'til you left.  Everything was done in French and all your reading and your talking and just whatever conversation you had was always in French.  And he was just a regular Joe kind of person.  And he was a African American, but he was Monsieur Johnson (French accent), you know, whatever.  It was funny.  So, and I'm not his name was not Johnson, but I can't remember what his name was.  But I remember him very well.  I can picture him, but I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, what about some of the students there?  You mentioned some of the them.  And did you know Nikki Giovanni [poet/professor] well or any of these--.
Speaker 2: No, I just knew who she was.  Yeah. She was not--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Julius Lester [writer/professor] or Diane Nash [Bevel] [civil rights activist] or--.
Speaker 2: I knew Diane, but she got very--well they all got very involved in the--in the sit-ins.  And I really wasn't.  So--.
Speaker 1: Yeah, she took leadership really for a lot of it--.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, she was up in--she was in jail and all that.  So, I mean, I certainly knew them and respected what they were doing, but--.
Speaker 1: And then James Bevel [pastor/activist] was a seminarian over at the--.
Speaker 2: And John Lewis [U.S. congressman/activist].
Speaker 1: John.
Speaker 2: And--but they were not my running buddies, but I knew who they were.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you get involved in the social life at Fisk? Any of the sorority stuff?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't do a sorority.  I didn't have time.  I was so busy going to parties and stuff.  I was a real party girl.  And I just that took too much time, this pledging.  I just didn't see that. I couldn't--.
Speaker 1: Now, wait a second here.  This is almost counter-intuitive to what we know about most--about college life.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, a lot of people, a lot--you know, there were about half that did and half that didn't, you know.  And it just so happened my friends didn't pledge.  So, and I had no pressure.  My mother had--was not in a sorority.  And a lot of--any friends that I had that did pledge, they were doing it because their mothers wanted them to do it.  So they kind of just, you know, went through it that way.
Speaker 1: A tradition of--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  But I didn't have that.  I mean, so I didn't see it.  And I, it took a lot of time.  And I was too busy having a good time to stop to do that and have some girls beating up on me and ordering me around.  I just didn't see it.  I mean, I had my friends, and I was fine, you know.  So it didn't--didn't really mean that much to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did you feel sort of like an outsider in that situation?
Speaker 2: Oh my gosh, no.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: Not at all, not in the least.  Not in the least.  It never even--I shouldn't say it didn't cross my mind.  I did think about it one time.  A girl that was from Columbia, South Carolina, that I really liked, Carol--Carol Cooper.  And she asked me about pledging Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated].  So I guess if I had pledged, that's what I would have pledged 'cause Carol talked to me about it.  But I didn't--she wanted me--I had to come, go to like some, something they were having on a Saturday.  And I had something else I wanted to do that I felt was more important than doing that.  So I didn't want to go, so I didn't go.  And I just never thought about it anymore.
Story_ID: 4091
Speaker 1: What did you major in, education?
Speaker 2: Education, cause that's what my mother [Dorothy Ann Arrington] told me I had to major in.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was gonna be this teacher, so I had to do that.
Speaker 1: Okay, are there any other stories about Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee] you want to tell us?
Speaker 2: Oh, just the good time I had.  I had the best time in my entire life.  I mean, it was just so much fun, so much fun.  I don't know, I mean, I can't imagine anything better.  You know, and my mother had--had an opportunity for me to go to Wheaton College in [Norton] Massachusetts.  A woman that she had gone to NYU [New York University, New York City, New York] with was the--what do you call it, the president of the college.  And she was looking for black students at that time--back then.  And she spoke--she said, "Dorothy, you have a daughter.  Why don't you consider sending her up?"  And so my mother talked to me about it, and I told her, "No, indeed."  I was not interested in being around, you know, just all white kids.  I didn't want to spend my college life like that and--'cause I had a friend who had started college about a year or two before me who was at one of the state teachers colleges in New York--upstate New York.  And she was miserable.  She had a horrible time, but she wanted to--she really wanted to be a teacher.  And at that time, those were the good colleges, the state teachers colleges in New York, particularly, if you wanted to teach in New York.  And she went to one of those, and she never had any parties to go to.  She never had any friends.  I mean, she was just miserable.  And I said, "Mother, I don't want to do that."  And, of course, they were going to give me, you know, almost a full scholarship and so forth.  I said, "Nope. Not me."
Speaker 1: Did they tell you that you would be the first?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I knew that, yeah.  I would be their first.  And this woman, this president, wanted that under her, you know, bailiwick to say that she integrated the school.  Wrong person.  You know, I'm sure there's some girl out there that wants to do that.  But I'm not that person.
Speaker 1: Well, many people we've talked to felt that it's their obligation to be the first one and--.
Speaker 2: No, see, I--I didn't feel like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.
Speaker 2: And see, my mother kind of did because she went to NYU, which was all white back then, and it's still all white.  My father [Martin Luther Arrington] went to West Virginia State [College, Institute, West Virginia], which was all black then.  And he wanted me to really have the--a black college experience.  He felt there was nothing like it.  Well, my mother didn't understand that because she didn't have that.  She didn't understand why I didn't want to go to Wheaton, you know, and be the--so what if I'm the first.  It's, you know, a good school, it's all women.  Ooh! (grimaces). So I said, "No.  That's not for me."  So I didn't go.  But--and I, but I mean those people--my husband [Ron Brown] ended up going to Middlebury [College, Middlebury, Vermont].  And he was one of the early ones and I think he was the only one in his class, and all that kind of stuff.  And then there were--I think there was one in a class ahead of him and one in a class behind him.  And he was fine.  He liked it.  I'm just not that kind--I wasn't that kind of person.  So I chose Fisk.  I was happy as a lark (laughs).  Let Wheaton have somebody else.
Story_ID: 4092
Speaker 1: Well, when it was time to graduate [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee], how did you tear yourself away from it?  I mean, there was (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was hard.  It was hard.
Speaker 1: This was 1962, I guess.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) But I was ready to go though, you know.  I mean you've been in college then, you know, you want to get out and start working and have your own money, you know, and that kind of thing.  And 'cause I didn't go to graduate school [Manhattanville College, Purchase, New York] until after I had my children. So--and my father [Martin Luther Arrington] had said to me I had--'cause I got married [to Ron Brown] right after I graduated.  My father said, "Well, you want to get married, okay.  But if you don't get married, I'll pay for your graduate, you know, degree and all."  I said, "Daddy, the last thing I want to do is go back to school."  I'm--it just wasn't, you know, in my mind then.  I had had--I was like (cuts hand in finished motion) with school.  As much fun as I had, but I--I was not interested in--in going back.  So I went back much later to get my Master's.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got married right after school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, well, tell me about how did you meet your husband?
Speaker 2: Well, I met him in Sag Harbor [New York] in 1959, Labor Day weekend.  And I was at Fisk and he was at Middlebury [College, Middlebury, Vermont].  And we met at a party.  And he went back to school, I went back to school.  He had a girlfriend,  I had a boyfriend. But we kind of liked each other, you know.  So we kept in touch and then Christmas when we came home from school, we talked on the phone and we saw each other at something--at a--I think it was a Jack & Jill [of America, Inc.] party over the holidays.  And just talked and talked and talked at this party.  And I was there with the guy I was going with, and I don't think he was--he was there with somebody else, but it wasn't the girl he was going with at the time.  And--'cause he was going with a white girl, and he did not take her to the Jack & Jill party, took some other girl to this Jack & Jill party.  But I took the guy that--he was at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] at the time, the guy I was going out with.  And--so it was so noticeable that the guy I was with, my boyfriend, was like, "Would you come on," you know, 'cause I was just standing there talking to--at that time I called him Ronnie.  So he said--he mouthed to me (mouths words) "I'll call you tomorrow".  So I said, "Okay."  So I left and he called and we just talked and--. Then we went back to school.  And we wrote each other all the time.  Then that summer when we came home from school, we were together all summer.  I worked up in the Bronx [New York], and he was working down on--like in the courts or something.  He was doing something down there.  And I was working at a playground up in the Bronx.  And he would ride the subway up to meet me after work and then we'd ride the subway to Brooklyn [New York].  And we'd go to the movies or have dinner at my house or just piddle around and stuff.  So we spent basically the whole summer just, you know, doing stuff.  Boyfriend-girlfriend kind of stuff.  And then we'd go back to school in September and go back to our regular lives at school.  And then that winter, like February, he invited me up for Winter Weekend, I think--Winter Carnival, his school called it, Middlebury called it.  And I went up to that.  And that was kind of when we really got tight.  And that next summer, we spent our summer together and doing stuff.  And I had the same job, and he had kind of like the same job.  And then we got engaged at Christmastime and got married that summer.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. I was wondering the distance and, you know, how that happened--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, that's how--yeah, it was the summer and the--but we wrote and everything during the school year.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--so you moved back to Brooklyn when you got married or--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, no, when we first got married, we lived in--in Harlem [New York City, New York] in Lenox Terrace in his father's apartment 'cause we moved in with his father because Ron was in ROTC. [Army Reserve Officer Training Corps] and we were to go right into the army in October. Excuse me.  And we couldn't go because they re-tested his eyes and they found his eyes were so bad, he could never be in artillery.  He was assigned to the artillery division.  That's where you shoot guns and everything.  And so the next class that was available for training was transportation, which wasn't going to be available until February down at Fort Eustis [Virginia].  So we got married in August, moved into Lenox Terrace when we came back from our honeymoon, stayed there through--until it was time to go to Fort Eustis in February.  Ron started law school at St. John's [University, New York City, New York] in September of that year at night.  And he was working for the New York City public welfare system during the day.  And he was going to law school at night.  So then we packed up our stuff, moved to Fort Eustis for training--for him for training.  And we were there from February--from March, I guess it was, the beginning of March, until July when we were sent to Germany.
Story_ID: 4093
Speaker 1: And in order for him [husband, Ron Brown] to take his wife to Germany or a 'dependent,' at that time they called them, your 'dependent,' you had to give them--give the army--an extra year.  So normally his tour would have just been two years, but because we were married, and I went with him, we had to stay an extra year.  Well, we felt we'd be in Europe, what the hell, you know.  That would be great.  So, we went to Germany that July and we stayed for three years.  In fact, our son [Michael Brown] was born over there.  And Michael had dual citizenship when he was born because he was born in a German hospital.  And, not by choice, but because I couldn't make the American hospital in Frankfurt [Germany].  My labor pains were coming too quickly and my doctor felt I couldn't make it down there, so I had to go to the German hospital on the--what they call on the 'local economy.'  And if an American has a baby there, the baby is then born--I mean, has German citizenship.  And, of course, 'cause he was born to an American mother and American parents, he had the dual citizenship.  And he could make his decision at twenty-one what he wanted to do.  So that was a interesting experience, having a baby in Germany, in a German hospital.  It's very different than having a baby in an American hospital.  Just quickly, I won't go through my--all of what I had to go through, but they don't give you anything for pain.  You deliver straight out, just it's basically having natural because they, you know, those are strong women.  And they deliver their babies without any--any kind of anesthesia or anything.
Speaker 2: Now just--that's different from the United States, in those days especially, they would knock the women out--and they'd wake up with a baby.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh, they would knock you out, and you wouldn't know a thing. Right, you'd have a baby.  And that's what I was gonna have in--in the American hospital, the army hospital, if I had made it, I would have--'cause my doctor and I had talked about what he was going to do.  It was either, you got ether or an epidural where they--and--.
Speaker 2: So you had no preparation for natural childbirth, but you--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I wasn't prepped--prepared.  Some women, believe it or not, some women, American service--I mean American wives of servicemen, wanted to have their babies like that and chose to go to the German hospital.  But in doing so, they were prepared and had taken the childbirth classes and they knew how to breath properly and so forth and so on.  I didn't know diddly about any of that.  And I went in there cold, having this baby, didn't know what to expect.  And it was something else.  I mean it was something else.  So it was opposite of everything at the American hospital.  At the American hospital, they kept you like three days and then sent you home.  The German hospital they kept you eight days, so by the time you went home, you were feeling fine.  The baby was, you know, plumped, kind of plumped up.  And it was hell having the baby, but after you had the baby, you felt great.  And they kept you such a long time until, you know, by the time you were ready to go home, everything, you know, had kind of calmed down and so forth.  But the whole process of having this baby was a trip.
Speaker 2: Well, which method did you think was the best method after--?
Speaker 1: Well, I had my daughter [Tracey Brown]--when I had my daughter, I had her in a regular hospital.  And I had a--a woman obstetrician who does not believe in women suffering through childbirth.  She thinks it's ridiculous to have to suffer through childbirth.  And she had three children of her own.  And so she believed if you want something, she's gonna give you something. Excuse me.  And so I had--I think I had gas with Tracey.  I didn't feel a thing.  I woke up and I had a baby, basically, kind of thing.  But in Germany, you hold your own legs, you deliver in your own nighty, all of that sterility that we go through--none of that.  I mean it was a trip.  They gave--they give you a shot, if you're not nursing, to drive your milk and that's it, you know.  And then they--they bind you with some cloth or something.  It was just the--just very basic, very basic.  Oh, every time I think about it--.  Sterile, you know, and just no warmth or anything.  But, they pamper you like crazy after you have the baby, you know, they can't do enough for you.  So, I don't know.  It's--I guess, six in one hand, half a dozen of the other 'cause in the American hospital, it's "Okay, you had your baby (looks at watch), time to go home."  You know, they're ready to put you out.  And in the German hospital, they really, really take good care of you after you have the baby.
Story_ID: 4094
Speaker 1: We're in Germany.  Now, you were there three years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And--yeah. What was--were there any issues in the army with African American soldiers in those days or were they--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) We [with husband, Ron Brown] didn't--we didn't personally have any, but I certainly heard about some.  But as a couple, we didn't experience any.  We were the only black officers on the--on our base, when we were there.  We were in a--in a small--in a small compound.  And--it might have been one guy that was a bachelor, a black guy, but we didn't see much of him.  But that was about it.  And then, you know, people are rotating off and you make very good friends, very quickly and you get very tight with people in the army because everybody's leaving at some point.  And then you're away from your families so you only have your army friends.  And you get very close to people and you have, you know, the holiday dinners together, you know, Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter are always spent with friends, not family.  You know, 'cause nobody has family, particularly when you're overseas.  Maybe in the States [the United States of America], you know, you can get back and forth with your family.  But it was just us and our friends who--it was just them.  I mean they didn't have anybody either.  So you tend to gravitate to people and get close to people.  And so we made some very good friends.  We had a good experience in the army, so good that we really considered staying in.  When it was time for Ron to get out, he had to make a decision whether to get out or stay in.  And what prompted him to go on and get out was St. John Law School--St. John's [University] Law School [New York, New York] who wrote him and said if he didn't come back by the end of the year, the--that calendar year, he would lose the credits that he had before because you can only stay out I think up to four years or something like that and--or five years.  And after we left Germany, he had to go to Korea.  He was sent to Korea.  And so--and I couldn't go to Korea with him.  And so after he did his Korea stint, he said "I'd better get out if I want to--if we're going to get out, we'd better out now."  And he was a captain when--when he got out because he was on the fast track, the one percent or what they--was it one percent or a five percent, which meant that you--you made grade, you made the next grade quickly.  And that's the--the kind of path he was on.  He was--he did very well.  And he--'cause we went in, he was a second lieutenant and then he made first lieutenant in a shorter period of time than you normally do.  And then he made captain in a shorter period of time than you normally do.  And so he was on that track to do well, but--so if he was gonna stay, he needed to--to stay.  And he was gonna have to go to Vietnam and so we made the decision, maybe we better go on and get out.  So that's how we got out.  But we had a very good experience.  We traveled a lot, got to see just about all of Europe on basically no money, you know, and had our son [Michael Brown] there.  And all of our family came over, at least once.  My mother [Dorothy Ann Arrington] came twice 'cause she came after I had the baby.  But our parents, you know, got to see us over there.
Speaker 1: So this is about 1966, '67 [1967].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That you come back?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Story_ID: 4095
Speaker 1: Now, black America changed a lot from 1962 to--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, we [with husband, Ron Brown] were there during the--the March on Washington [DC].  And all I knew about it was my mother [Dorothy Ann Arrington] sent me 'Ebony' [magazine] in--I guess maybe in November.  And it was in--whatever issue she sent, it was in that issue, the whole March on Washington.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) They didn't show them on German television or anything?
Speaker 2: No, no.  We were, we heard about it in the 'Stars and Stripes.'  That was the, the newspaper, the army newspaper.  But it was after it was over that the march took place on the Mall in Washington, DC.  But you didn't have a flavor for it.  It wasn't until she sent me 'Ebony,' and I saw the pictures in the magazine.  We were just, "Oh, my gosh."  Our eyes almost fell out of our heads because that issue, when you opened up, on both pages, it was like one full page, you know, with the two sides.  And you just saw people.  I mean you got a real sense of it.  I had not gotten a sense of it from the army newspaper at all.  It was just mentioned.  And it was like a little story and that was about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now 'Stars and Stripes,' I guess it wasn't in the interest of the army to talk about that a lot, I guess. The march on Washington.
Speaker 2: Pardon me?
Speaker 1: I don't think it was necessarily in the interest of the army, I guess, to talk about (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) They just mentioned it as a news item.  You know, it was just a little story.  I don't even remember if there was a photograph of it.
Speaker 1: Did you have access to German media?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had--we had a TV.  And--but we spoke very little German.  I spoke enough to deal with my housekeeper.  I had a housekeeper.  And--but she spoke better English than I spoke German so I didn't really need it with her.  But if you--I went shopping on the local economy, I needed to be able to converse with a store person, which I did.  I knew enough to buy stuff.  And I knew, of course, the money and everything.  But the TV--we would put TV on for sports.  And we would watch the skiing, the Olympics and the--there was always skiing on even--whether it was Olympics or not and ice skating.  And we'd watch it just like you watch it now with no sound, you know.  And we were big radio listeners and would listen to the radio and stories on the radio, you know, 'The Shadow.'  They re-played 'The Shadow' and a lot of little mystery things they had on the radio for us.
Speaker 1: Did you have 'Voice of America' [US government's international broadcasting service]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had all that, yeah.  You could get that, but we listened and we did a lot of reading.  Ron and I would sit in the living room at night and read with the radio, you know.  And it was--it's just amazing how your pattern changes, you know.  You--you adjust to what the environment is.  And we learned how to play bridge in Germany as a couple, we learned together.  And there were other couples that played.  So we belonged to a bridge group.  I belonged to a ladies group, and then we belonged to a couples bridge group.  And we played a lot of bridge, and, you know, you'd go back and forth to people's houses and entertain like that.  And there was a lot of entertaining going on in the army, particularly officers.  So a lot going on, so--.
Speaker 1: So they didn't have a heavy load, necessarily--.
Speaker 2: In terms of work, no.  He was home every day at five o'clock.  Sometimes he came home for lunch.  I mean, it was that, you know, light.  He had to go out I think maybe once a quarter on some overnight mission to act like a soldier, you know, crawl on the ground or something.  But that was about it.  It was more of a exercise than anything else--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Packing up their bags, making sure they had everything in their little sacks and they did that.  And that was about it.
Speaker 1: Did the Germans discuss the Civil Rights Movement at all or the position of black people in the United States with you?
Speaker 2: Not with me.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (Unclear)
Speaker 2: The only person I talked to was my housekeeper.  And she and, and her husband spoke English too.  And--but we never talked about that.  And I had a woman that did my hair.  She was a young a girl that did my hair, and--no, we never talked about that.
Speaker 1: It's often been said that the Civil Rights Movement was successful because of the publicity that, you know, or the stories in the media that got out of the United States into the foreign press so that, for instance, a civil rights march in Mississippi that may go unnoticed in the United States would get out, out of here, I mean into England and Germany and France.  And people could see.  They'd have journalists down at these marches and actually shoot pictures and show, you know, what was really going on. It was hard for the United States to--.
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean with the--excuse me--with the dogs and all that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was hard for the US [United States] to play the--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Play that down.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) The champion of freedom and yet have this going on in the United States.
Speaker 2: I don't remember seeing that.
Speaker 1: But you never saw anything?
Speaker 2: No.  And I don't remember anybody mentioning it--that they saw anything.
Story_ID: 4096
Speaker 1: So when you came back (from three years in Germany), I mean, did you think that things had kind of radically changed since you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh, I couldn't believe it when I came back.  And I couldn't believe Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was talking about Vietnam.  He was like all into that when we [with husband, Ron Brown] came back. And--.
Speaker 1: That--that shocked you that he was talking about Vietnam?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, cause it just seemed so out of his--what I thought was his--because I had heard him speak at Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  He had spoken there one time when I was there.  But I couldn't believe he was talking about Vietnam.  I mean, it was like, that was new for me to hear him talk about it.  On TV I think it was, was Diahann Carroll on then with that show ['Julia']--?
Speaker 1: 'Julia,' that came on in '67 [1967] or '68 [1968]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Is that the new show? Yeah.  That was--that was a new thing to see.  And it was--you'd sit around the dinner table and somebody would say, "Oh, they had a negro on the such and such commercial.  There was one, you know, going in the store or something."  And everyone: "I saw that, I saw that," you know. So I remember listening to people say stuff like that, you know.  Or, "Oh there was one on such and such a show doing this and that."  But it was always a very small part in the background or, you know, something, playing, you know, a very small role.  But it was very big talking--talking about that.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you think of the Black Power Movement when you got back?
Speaker 2: That was new, that was very new to me, the whole--the [Black] Panthers and all.  They were big then.  I guess they got big like in the '70s [1970s], early '70s--late '60s [1960s], early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: They started 1966 or 7 [1967]--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it was--I was just fascinated with it.  I was fascinated with it.  And I remember reading about all the good things they were doing, the feed--the breakfast--breakfast for the children or something.  And--but the white people talked about all the violence that they were purporting.  But I always thought they did good things 'cause of the breakfast and helping kids in school and so forth.  So that was interesting.  That was interesting, the whole Black Panther movement.
Story_ID: 4097
Speaker 1: Okay, so what did you do when you got back?  Did you teach or--.
Speaker 2: I taught--well, I got pregnant [with daughter, Tracey Brown].  After Ron [husband, Ron Brown] came back from--well, no, he came home from Korea on R and R [United States Army Rest and Recuperation program].  And I got pregnant.  And then he went back to Korea.  He came--and then he came back in--I think he got out in August, of the army totally.  And--no, he got out before August.  He must have gotten out in June because he went right back to law school [St. John's University, New York, New York] that summer.  He got into the summer program.  And he started working at the National Urban League.  And I was pregnant and I had Tracey in November.  So I worked that spring at [PS, Public School] 167 [The Parkway School, Brooklyn, New York], that's when I--I took over for a teacher who had gone on maternity leave.  And then I got pregnant and I couldn't--I couldn't go back in September 'cause I was due in November so I didn't bother to go back.  But I--I taught that spring semester there.  And then I didn't work after I had Tracey.  And then I went back part-time as a reading consultant for New York City public schools when Tracey was about a year old.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were living in--in Brooklyn [New York] again?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my parents [Martin Luther and Dorothy Ann Arrington] bought us a co-op when we came back from Germany.  And Michael [Brown, son] and--we moved in there with Ron for a month.  And then he went to Korea.  And then Michael and I stayed there while he was gone to Korea.  And then he came back in February for R and R.  And I got pregnant and then we had Tracey in November.  And we stayed in the apartment all through law school, for him for law school 'cause at that time St. Johns Law School was downtown Brooklyn.  It's now out in Queens [New York].  And he graduated from law school and then we bought a house in Mount Vernon, which is Westchester County in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, about what year is this?
Speaker 2: That was like '70 [1970], and I--'cause that's when I got my--yeah, that was in '70. And I went back to work at Mount Vernon High School [Mount Vernon, New York].  And at that time, in New York state, if you wanted to teach in the high schools, you had to have a Master's [degree].  So I went to Manhattanville College [Purchase, New York] and got my Master's in history, with a concentration in black history.  And--.
Speaker 1: Who were your teachers at Manhattanville?
Speaker 2: I don't remember, not nary a name, not a one.  And I was like a 'A' student.  I was the best student.
Speaker 1: Did you have black teachers for black history?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, believe it or not.  I don't remember any, and I don't remember--I don't remember any of their names, but they were not black.  But they were teaching black history.  And then--and I was still working at Mount Vernon High School.  And I was working for the--in the school, in the high school, they had a program for unwed mothers, for young girls that had gotten pregnant, but wanted to stay in high school.  And I worked in that program.  We were in the--in the high school, but like in another section, like downstairs, over on the side.  And they could bring their babies to school.  And we had a little nursery.  And at break time, they could go feed the baby and be with the babies and stuff.  And, oh, it was just a--it was a wonderful program. It was--I don't know if they still have that, but it was a wonder--great program.  And so I got my Master's and literally, we were driving down to here--to Washington [DC], my last day when I had to hand in my last paper.  And we stopped at school so I could hand it in before we got on the parkway to come to Washington.  And that's how I got--so I never graduated by participating.  I just got my diploma in the--my graduate degree, I guess I should call it, in the mail.
Story_ID: 4098
Speaker 1: Now why did you all come to [Washington] DC?
Speaker 2: At the time Ron [Brown, husband] was--he finished law school [St. John's University, New York, New York], and he was General Counsel of the National Urban League and Vernon was head of the League at that time, and--.
Speaker 1: Vernon Jordan.
Speaker 2: Jordan.  And he asked Ron to come to Washington and run the national office of the National Urban League.  And that's what he did.  That's how we got here.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, he moved pretty fast, you know, I guess, from, you know, after getting back here in the late '60's [1960s], you know, to that point, that's moving pretty fast in the Urban League.  Okay, so how did you like--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well, he was at the League for twelve years, 'cause he didn't leave the League until 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean but the amount of time it took him to get there and be in charge that was really fast, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, right, right, right.  Yeah, well the Urban League paid for law school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They sent him to law school.
Speaker 1: Did you know Whitney Young [activist/executive National Urban League]?  Did you ever meet him?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  Not long, but I mean, you know, he--I think his accident was like in the--in '71 maybe?
Speaker 1: I think so.  I think so, that's when he drowned off the coast of Africa.
Speaker 2: He was in Nigeria, I think.  Very lovely man.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Well, what was Washington, DC like for you?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved Washington, from the first day.  Well, first of all, I met--I saw so many people I'd gone to either camp with--'cause I went to Camp Atwater.  I forgot to mention that during my early years.
Speaker 1: Where was Camp Atwater and what is Camp Atwater?
Speaker 2: In Springfield, Massachusetts.  It's a African American camp and back then it was the only camp that black kids could go to.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it had a national--.
Speaker 2: National camper base, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Constituency, I guess. Base.
Speaker 2: Definitely.  Kids came from all over 'cause when I got to Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], I saw people I had gone to camp with.  And then, of course, I saw people I was in Jack & Jill [of America, Inc.] with.  I saw people that I had seen at Jack & Jill conferences, the teen conferences over the years.  And so it's--it's all--it all kind of feeds--Camp Atwater, Jack & Jill, a black college, all three fit into one another.  And you saw people that you know, you knew or had met or were friends with in all three arenas.  And that's how--how--what happened when I got to Washington as well.  And I was in Jack & Jill in New York growing up.  Michael [Brown, son] was in Jack & Jill.  I had him in Jack & Jill in New York before we moved to Washington.  So Tracey [Brown, daughter] was too young, but when we moved to Washington, I transferred to the Washington, DC chapter from Brooklyn [New York].  And so I got to meet a lot of people, you know, through Jack & Jill.  So I met people like right away.  And we got here late August in time for school to open, the first week of school.  And then like the first Jack & Jill meeting was in September so I got to meet people like right away.
Story_ID: 4099
Speaker 1: In 1975 you kind of changed careers, I guess, well, not--not--you were still involved in education, but you started working for the National Black Child Development Institute [NBCDI]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was my first--I guess that was my first job since I left New York, when I went to work for [N]BCDI.  And I started part-time because I still had--my children were young and I still needed to be at home.  And I started part-time.  I was working on a black college project, trying to get early childhood education curriculums into the black colleges.  We were trying to introduce it into black schools because black schools primarily had education basically from grade one to six.  They didn't do early childhood, whereas the--the other--some of the other colleges, you know, did understand the whole early--early childhood phenomenon.  And so that was my role.
Speaker 1: There was sort of a push in the late '60s [1960s] for early childhood education--.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And Head Start got big, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Operation Head Start, funded by the [President Lyndon B.] Johnson Administration and all that.
Speaker 2: Right, right and trying to get the black schools to be interested in that and to offer it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Especially attention was paid to low-income people (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right, exactly.  And that's why it was important that black schools to participate.  And so that was our--our--we had a grant from HUD [Department of Housing and Urban Development]--not HUD, I guess HH--HEW at that time--.
Speaker 1: Right. Health Education and Welfare [United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare; re-named the United States Department of Health and Human Services].
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so then the, the woman who was the Executive Director of [N]BCDI, Evelyn Moore, she came to me, and she said,  "Alma, we got more money for the black college project.  You think it's something you want to do full time?"  So I said, "Well, let me talk to Ronnie [husband, Ron Brown] about it  and I'll call you back."  And so we talked about how we would manage with the kids 'cause like they had this on Tuesdays and that on--you know, their different little activities that somebody had to get them to, and how we would manage and--with my working full time.  And so I can't remember now what--how we worked it all out, but we worked it out and I went to work full time.  And that was my first job outside of a classroom where I had a office, a desk, a telephone, a typewriter, a secretary that--she didn't just work for me.  I mean she worked for a lot of people, but she did your work and all.  I mean that was a wonderful experience.  I loved it.  And I traveled.  And--'cause I had to travel to all the black colleges.  And so, it was--it was a great job.  I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay. And you did that for--? I don't know, how--how long did you do--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I did that I guess for--as long as that grant lasted.  And then I left there and I went to work for (pauses) this, NCNW--.
Speaker 1: Right, National Child--.
Speaker 2: Nationall--.
Speaker 1: [National] Council of Negro Women.
Speaker 2: Thank you, very much, for Dr. [Dorothy] Height.  And I got--that was a great job because I ran a project that was totally different than education.  It was a employment program for rural women in Mississippi.  And I had a staff in Mississippi who ran the day-to-day program, and I was the national director here in Washington [DC].  And that grant was from Labor [United States Department of Labor].  That's when Alexis [Herman, United States Secretary of Labor] was at the Labor Department back then as the head of the Womens' Bureau.
Speaker 1: And so this is in '90s [1990s] now.
Speaker 2: No, that was in the late '70s [1970s] when [President James 'Jimmy'] Carter was still president.  And then we lost--I left there in 1980 when [President Ronald] Reagan became president because all of our--we didn't get any more money.  And we all had to--those of us that had programs out of the federal government had to leave because we didn't--Reagan didn't fund any of those programs.  And then I went to work for Hazel O'Leary.  O'Leary & Associates, as--she--she was a consultant.  She and her husband had a energy consulting firm.  And I did that for a little while.  And then I went to work for the city, [Washington] DC government, [Mayor] Marion Barry.  And I worked in the Office of International Business, totally different thing I did then.  And that was a great job, really good job.  And I enjoyed that a lot.  I enjoyed working with the city.  I'm a big fan of Marion's so you'll never get me to say anything negative about him (laughs).
Speaker 1: No, I'm not--I wasn't trying to.  And so the nature of that job was to attract international business to Washington, DC?
Speaker 2: Yes, to Washington, DC, not to the national government, to--you know, we have enough businesses in Washington that we could do joint ventures with.  And that's what we tried to encourage businesses form overseas to do.  And we had sister city agreement with Bangkok, Thailand; Senegal--Dakar, Senegal; and Beijing, China.  And so we had trade shows between the countries and we did an awful lot in--in that office.  And that was--that was fun.
Story_ID: 4100
Speaker 1: And then I left there and went to work for [W]KYS [-FM, 93.9, Washington, DC radio station].  So I'm totally in another area. Got in--I got into communications.  And I did public affairs and public relations for WKYS.  And I had a little talk show on Sunday mornings.  And I would come up with the guests, and the guests--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Who were some of your guests?
Speaker 1: All those city people, you know, the mayor [of Washington DC, Marion Barry] and the city council and whatever hot topic was going on, I'd try to get that person to come in and talk about it.  I did health issues, fitness, whatever was going on. I mean I had a--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) What was your most memorable program?
Speaker 1: I loved the health and fitness one.  We got a lot of calls--it was a call-in.  And we'd have the person on and chat with the person and then open the phones up.  And people could call in and ask questions.  And I liked--that was a good show.  I remember that show in particular.  Anytime we had the mayor, it was great--always good.  And--what else was good?  The health and fitness one, the mayor. I don't remember what some of the others were.  Those were the two that I remember very well.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, some of the issues--the mayor, himself, in those days was a topic, a hot topic in DC.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we didn't get into his personal stuff.  It was about city things, things going on in the city, whatever the topic was at the time. The lottery or the--bringing lottery to DC or the out-of-state banks coming to Washington.  We talked about that and that kind of--what that impact would have on local banks and on residents.  Would they get a better shot with, you know, in terms of borrowing money from the--from the national banks coming in or what.  And whatever the hot topic was, we talked about it that Sunday.  Whatever went on during the week, I tried to get the person on for Sunday morning.
Speaker 2: Was it mostly just political things or--or arts and culture--(unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) No, it was--I did health and fitness.  I did health and--I kind of stayed away from the arts only because, you have an audience--you have to appeal to your audience.  And we would gauge it by the kind of phones--the phone calls that we got in terms of the listeners, how we were doing.  And if we had somebody that came on to talk about an art show coming to town, nobody'd really call about that, or a dance troupe coming.
Story_ID: 4101
Speaker 1: So, you had your radio show [WKYS-FM Washington D.C., 93.9] for a number of years, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And at the same, your husband, Ron Brown, is becoming a major player in the Democratic [National] Party, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and when did he really get involved in the party politics?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) He really got involved in party politics in 1980.  That was his first, when he first got his foot in.  He was Deputy Campaign Manager for Teddy Kennedy [US Senator Edward Kennedy] when Kennedy was trying to run for the nomination against [President James 'Jimmy'] Carter, which he lost.  But--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) And Teddy got shot down by a Chappaquiddick [Island, Massachusetts, site of scandal around death of Kennedy acquaintance, Mary Jo Kopechne]--.
Speaker 2: Question.
Speaker 1: Question.  Right.
Speaker 2: He did a interview.  And the interview did--and the interview, as some people thought, did not go well.  And--but anyway, he went on and entered the primary any way and did, you know, fairly well and won California.  And Ron ran California for Teddy.  And so it endeared him to the family, the Kennedy family.  And--so after the election, Ron went to work for Teddy on Capitol Hill [Washington, DC] as Chairman--I mean, Teddy was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee.  And Ron became the Chief Counsel of the Judiciary Committee.  And he did that until the Democrats lost control of the Senate.  And then he--he was the ranking--whatever the second person is--as the Chief Counsel on the Democratic side.  He was the Chief Counsel.  And then he decided it was time for him to leave the Senate.  And he went to work for Patton Boggs--at that time, it was Patton, Boggs & Blow which was a law firm here in Washington.  And he went in as a partner.  And--which was good because he was their first black partner.  And he went in laterally as a partner as opposed to going in and--as an associate and working your way up.  He went in as a partner.  And the firm was wonderful.  We loved Patton, Boggs & Blow.  And he stayed at Patton Boggs and started getting involved--kept his interest in national politics, and got involved with Chuck Manatt, who was then the Chairman of the [Democratic National] Party.  And he was kind of like working with Chuck on some things.  I think he had a title of Deputy--Deputy Chairman of the Party.  They had about four Deputy Chairmens and he was one of them.  And then he--in '88 [1988], when [Reverend] Jesse [Jackson, Sr.] ran for the second time, Jesse came to him--first Jesse asked him to run his campaign.  And Ron said, "No, man, I can't leave the law firm to do that."  And he said, you know, "I have a family and two children in college or getting ready to go to college," whatever that was then.  And so then Jesse said, "Well, come and help me through the convention."  And so Ron agreed to do that.  And that way he could stay at the law firm and just kind of take a leave of absence through the convention.  So he got Jesse ready for the convention, handled all of the negotiations with the [Massachusetts Governor Michael] Dukakis people and all of that.  And through that process, he kind of got more interested in national politics.
Speaker 1: Now, this was Jesse Jackson's second run--.
Speaker 2: Second run.
Speaker 1: For President.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was in '88 [1988].  He ran--his first time running was in '84 [1984], which he did okay in.  But '88 [1988], he did very well.  He won I think like Michigan and some other places.  I don't remember--I know Michigan was the big one.  And so when he got to the convention, Ron had a lot to work with because Jesse had a lot of delegates to use back and forth with the Dukakis people in terms of the platform--the kinds of things Jesse wanted in the platform.  He was able to get--because he had all these delegates--where he spoke, you know, the time, where he was on the program in terms of speaking.  Because he had all these delegates, Ron was able to negotiate very well for him.  And then the campaign, what his role was gonna be in the Dukakis campaign, Jesse's role.  He wanted a plane and he wanted staff and so forth and so on.  And he got all that.  And by releasing his delegates to Dukakis, you know, he was able to get all these things to help Dukakis in the campaign.
Story_ID: 4102
Speaker 1: Anyway, so after that he [husband, Ron Brown] came home one day, and he said, "You know, I think I want to run  for Chairman [of the Democratic National Committee]."  And I said, "Chairman?"  And he said, "Yeah, I think I want to run for Chairman of the Party."  I said, "Oh, my gosh."  So I said, "Do you think you can win that thing, you know, all those white people?"  And he said, "Well, I don't know. I'm gonna give it a shot."  So he talked to Tommy Boggs who was the main member of the firm who he was very close to, who actually brought him to the firm.  And Tommy was the managing partner at the time.  And so, Tommy said, "Yeah, if you want to try it, go on, you know, Patton Boggs will be right here for you.  So don't worry, you know.  And you go on and do what you feel you want to do.  And, you know, you have the law firm behind you."  So he went on and ran for Chairman, raised more money than anybody had raised to run for Chairman and ended up--when he started running, there were about nine other people running.  And by the time the vote came in--he started out I think in September, talking about it.  And then he threw his hat in the ring officially, like I think December.  And the vote was in February and by the time they finished, were ready for the vote, he was the only one.  Everybody else had dropped out because he had done so well.  He was gathering up, you know, votes and everything.  And so he was unanimously selected or voted in or whatever.  So he said to me,  you know, "Nothing's gonna happen as Chairman.  Your lifestyle won't change.  It will still--everything will be the same," you know.  So I said, "Okay, we'll see." And it didn't.  I have to admit.  We had a good time when he was Chairman of the Party.  We got to, oh, go everywhere.  And we took--were able to take the kids with us.  And they got very involved in national politics.  I got very involved.  We followed the races all over the country, who was running for the most obscure race in Iowa or something, you know, or city council, whatever.  Whatever Democrats were doing all over the country, we kept abreast of.  So he put together his little team and he really felt strongly that we [Democrats] could take back the White House in '92 [1992].  And sure enough, he was right, you know.  We did with President [William 'Bill'] Clinton.
Story_ID: 4103
Speaker 1: Now, how did he [husband, Ron Brown]--was there a story about how he first met [Arkansas Governor, William 'Bill'] Clinton?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he met Clinton when he was running for Chairman [of the Democratic National Committee].  And they hit it off, and, in fact, Clinton was one of the early governors, southern governors, that supported him for Chairman.  And Clinton was--or whatever they call, President or Chairman of the National Governors Association at the time Ron was Chairman of the Party.  And so they got to see each other a lot through then.  And--then Clinton became one of the candidates.  And it was in January, Ron and Tracey--our daughter, Tracey, and I were in Hawaii.  He was giving a speech and we had gone to Hawaii with him for this speech.  And that was during the time when Hillary [Rodham Clinton] and Bill went on TV, on '60 Minutes.'  And we, the three of us, watched that show.  And I think he came out of that show with Clinton--that he was feeling pretty good about Clinton.  And that was the very beginning of the primary season.  But he had to be neutral.  I mean he couldn't, you know, support 'cause he had all these other candidates.  I think there were seven of them.
Speaker 1: Including Jesse Jackson again.  He, he announced that--.
Speaker 2: Oh, not really.  Jesse kind of stayed out of '92 [1992].  He--he didn't really run in '92 [1992].  He and Ron had a meeting of the minds.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) I seem to remember some friction or something around that.  Wasn't it?
Speaker 2: He didn't run.
Speaker 1: He didn't.  Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't run, he didn't run.  He was--his main thing then was for '92 [1992], he wanted a good place on the speaking program, you know, a good night.  And he wanted a plane and staff for the campaign.  That's always his thing.  And he got all that.  And-- but he didn't run.  He did not run in '92 [1992].
Speaker 1: He didn't--he wasn't--well, okay.
Speaker 2: No.  And he talked about it, but then he and Ron talked and he decided he would--he wouldn't do it.  But he did get all those other concessions though.  And Clinton went right through, you know, the primaries, as you know, and came in second in New Hampshire, and called himself the 'Come Back Kid' or something like that (laughs).  And, and then started winning a lot of the others after that, you know, coming in first in some of the others.  And then we look up, and once he won California, that was it.  The others all kind of fell by the wayside.
Speaker 1: Okay, fine, so this is the big--
Speaker 2: This is the big league.
Speaker 1: This is a big victory.
Speaker 2: Well, his big victory was David Dinkins in New York [mayoral election], Ron's big victory, and Doug Wilder [gubernatorial election] in Virginia.  Those were his big--his big races that he wanted desperately to win for the [Democratic] Party, which I--the way he was thinking that you're judged by the races that you win.  And those were the two big ones out of the--out of the, the door at that time.  And--.
Speaker 1: Now, the President's race is not--.
Speaker 2: No, that was before--.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The--the Wilder and--Wilder and Dinkins were before '92 [1992].  But for Ron as Chairman, it was important for him to win those races.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was a set up for a prelude to '92 [1992].
Speaker 2: Yeah, to get the party ready, people ready, that black candidates can beat white candidates in big white districts or cities or whatever it happened to be.  And here it was Wilder winning in--winning the states of Virginia and Dinkins winning in New York.  So those were--those were big races for him on his way to '92 [1992].
Story_ID: 4104
Speaker 1: Do you have a big role to play in any of this activity or did you--?
Speaker 2: Back then, I was--I went with him to all the debates, all the presidential debates.  I went to all of them, and met everybody, met all the candidates, fell in love with Hillary [Rodham Clinton] the first time I met her.  Oh, I just thought she was just terrific.  And I met her at the--I think at the Iowa debate or New Hampshire, whichever one came first.  And I saw them subsequently at each debate after that.
Speaker 1: Okay, and, of course, [Governor Arkansas William] Bill Clinton does quite well in the primary elections and he's--
Speaker 2: Did well in the primaries.  And then I went with Ron to all the debates he had with [President] George [H.] Bush.  And I think, they weren't all--but maybe he had two, two or three.  And then we went to the vice presidents, with [US Senator Al] Gore and what's the guy's name?  Gore and--.
Speaker 1: It's hard to remember, now isn't it?
Speaker 2: Hard to remember his name.
Speaker 1: Quayle, Dan Quayle.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Quayle Quayle. Yeah, and we went to those.  We had to go to those.  And--.
Speaker 1: What was his--did you--were you in on some of the strategy?  What were some of the strategies?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the strategy was what they called the 'Coordinated Campaign.'  That meant if--let's take President Clinton in Arkansas.  The campaign was for everyone running--every Democrat running for elective office in the state of Arkansas where everybody was on the same page in terms of message.  You stayed on message, and get out the vote and all those things were all the same from the person running for city council all the way up to Bill Clinton running for President.  It was the--that was Ron's big thing, 'Coordinated Campaign.'
Speaker 1: He was trying to get all the Democrats on the same page.
Speaker 2: On the same page.
Speaker 1: A way to define what a Democrat was?  The Democrats had--.
Speaker 2: So when you come to vote for your little--the little guy running for mayor, you also make sure you vote for the person running for Congress, for the senator and for the person running for President.  That's the Democrat.  You just pull the whole lever on the Democratic side.  And that was the 'Coordinated Campaign.'
Speaker 1: Okay, now, was he ever--well, was he keenly concerned, or--about issues or planks in the Democratic platform that he wanted to see in there that they, that--.
Speaker 2: I don't remember anything that he wanted to see in there that didn't get in there.  Or what was in there that he didn't agree with.  So I don't remember any of that being a discussion that he was concerned about.
Speaker 1: So he was pretty much--were there things that he, you know, told you that he wanted to make sure were in there that, you know, that he himself, you know, was able to push through.
Speaker 2: I can't remember anything that they came up with that he wasn't in favor of because he was involved in all that from the beginning.  I mean, he put together the platform committee.  They were people that he chose.  And that's how the Chairman does--the Chairman selects the people on all of the committees.  And so the platform committee was put together by the Chairman, who shared the same ideas that he shared--that he had.  So he never had a problem with the platform.
Story_ID: 4105
Speaker 1: To your knowledge, like who were allies and then who were his [husband, Ron Brown] enemies?
Speaker 2: His main person was a guy by the name of Paul Tulley, who was his--who--who has passed as well.  But Paul was the backroom guy.  Paul was the person that crunched the numbers.  Paul was the person that had his cigarettes and his bottle of gin or whatever.  And he could look at a map of the United States with all the congressional districts and tell you who the Democrat was, who he was running against, and who he expected to win out of each of those districts.  He was--he was just amazing.  And he was Ron's, he was the Political Director for Ron.  He was just the best--the best.  And he passed away during the '92 [1992] campaign.  After [Arkansas Governor William 'Bill'] Clinton was--was selected as the--as the presidential candidate, Paul passed away.  So he never saw anything come to fruition of all the things that he had done with the 'Coordinated Campaign' and the--and how he, you know, felt so strongly about message and everything.  So he would have been thrilled to know that Clinton had won 'cause he had worked on the map.  And he had--he and Ron had delivered a--a party to Clinton when he ran--when the convention was over, Clinton got a party that was ready, that was professional, that had every congressional district, you know, on top--everybody knew exactly what they were doing and on message and everything.  And that was all because of--I call Paul Tulley.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did he have any major opposition within the Democratic [National] Party, people who didn't like him, and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he did going in when he became Chairman [of the Democratic National Committee].  There were some southern state Chairs that were not choked up about it because they felt he was the wrong person at the wrong time to be Chairman.  It wasn't time for a black person, you know, that regular stuff.  But he ended up kind of winning those people over.  You know, when you first--you know, you win some elections and people kind of, you know, say, "Well, maybe he's not such a--a bad choice," you know.  And by winning that--those--that big, big election in Virginia [gubernatorial election, Doug Wilder victory] and then the one in New York [City, mayoral election, David Dinkins victory], that helped a lot in getting him, getting Ron ready for '92 [1992] in terms of when he asked people to start, you know, sending the money in, they--they did it because they knew he--they trusted his judgment on stuff.

Speaker 1: President [William 'Bill'] Clinton was elected in 1992.  Other things started to happen for your family and, you know, Ron Brown [husband, Ron Brown].  What happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, the President wanted him to join the Cabinet.  And I really didn't want him to do it.  I wanted him to go right back to Patton Boggs [Washington DC law firm] and go back to the law firm, and, you know, do whatever he wanted to do at the [Democratic] Party, but you don't have to be in the Cabinet, you know.  Just leave it a--you know, let somebody else do that.  And he felt he had worked too hard to get Clinton elected not to be part of the--not to be at the table.  And he wanted to be at the table.  So, that's why he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, now he was chosen as new United States Secretary of Commerce--.
Speaker 2: Commerce.
Speaker 1: Right. And this was a key position in an administration that was known for--well, the phrase they--and they repeated it this morning on television, "It's the economy, stupid," you know.  Sometimes people say that the present administration, the present president [President George W. Bush] doesn't understand yet.  Or--.
Speaker 2: He doesn't understand.  His father [President George H. Bush] didn't understand.
Speaker 1: So and this seems odd in the twentieth century for a Democratic president to be concerned about the economy on that level, but and Ron Brown's in a key position to do something to stimulate that economy.
Speaker 2: He and the President had many talks about how important commerce was gonna be and how he wanted it to be the mainstay of--excuse me--of the whole economic team.  And that was when the economic team was--was Ron and [Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, Robert E.] Rubin and [United States Secretary of the Treasury] Lloyd Bentsen was at Treasury.  And Mickey Kantor was the USTR, Trade Representative. And that was a big economic team, and they--they came up with the whole--that whole tax structure in '93 [1993] that put us on the road to recovery, economic recovery, and get rid of the deficit.  And--.
Speaker 1: A huge deficit.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That was the team that put all that together.
Speaker 1: So they get rid of this huge deficit, create a surplus and, you know, prosperity, at least economic prosperity in terms of jobs and so on last for another, you know, it lasted actually for another eight years until--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Just recently [2003 interview].
Story_ID: 4107
Speaker 1: What of the--what are the highlights for you of this period of time in being--having the family involved in--as the United States Secretary of Commerce [husband, Ron Brown] in a Cabinet-level position, I know it drags--it pulls the whole family into,  so--.
Speaker 2: It was--it was okay.  I mean, I enjoyed his--his stint as Chairman of the [Democratic National Committee] Party better than I did when he was in the Cabinet because we were able to do things with him as Chairman--we, meaning the family.  But in the Cabinet, you know, everything is, you know, oh, it's taxpayers' dollars.  So, you know, we, we couldn't--the government wouldn't pay for me to do anything.  I couldn't have a luncheon.  I couldn't--I couldn't do anything and get government funds to pay for it.  If we traveled--if I wanted to go with him to Boston [Massachusetts] or to California, whatever, I had to pay my own way.  If I wanted to go on the--on a US [United States] plane--on a government plane, they charged me like what would be a first-class ticket.  You know, they charge you just a phenomenal amount of money.  So I said, "Well, don't worry, if I'm going to fly first-class, I'll fly on American [Airlines]--if I have to pay for first-class, I'll fly on American, get my mileage," (laughs) you know.  And--but, so I attended a lot of times.  If we were going to California, he would go ahead of me or after me, and I would, you know, fly on a commercial airline.  And I could fly first-class, get my mileage, and I'll see you there, kind of thing, cause our daughter [Tracey Brown] lived in LA [Los Angeles, California] at the time, at the time Ron was in the--in Commerce, at Commerce, in the administration.  And so I'd go out there to see her and if he had to be out there for something, then I'd go out also so that we could spend time with her as a family, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they don't encourage--encourage spouses to be involved because it's tax-payer money.  So, you know, if I wanted to go and then have--let's say he was going to California for a speech or whatever.  And he always went by the Commerce office in whatever, wherever he was.  And I wanted to do a little luncheon with staff people or something, I'd have to pay for it out of my own pocket--for the wives of, you know, people.  Whereas at the Party, they would pay for all of that--when he was Chairman of the Party 'cause it--I--I did stuff for--well, particularly for the [Democratic National] Convention, I had, did a lot of things for the wives of the state Party chairs and different things like that.  And the Party paid for everything.  But I don't know.  It was just a different kind of--you just didn't feel needed as I felt needed with the Party.  You know, you felt like you were, it was a team helping the Democrats, with Commerce, it's whoever the person is in charge, that's who everybody looks to, you know.  So, just a different way I guess.
Story_ID: 4108
Speaker 1: Wasn't too long after he [husband, Ron Brown] was appointed [as United States Secretary of Commerce under President William 'Bill' Clinton] that he was involved in the plane crash.
Speaker 2: Three years.
Speaker 1: Three years.
Speaker 2: He got to serve for three years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of '93 [1993], '94 [1994] and '95 [1995].  And then the accident was in March of--I mean, April of '96 [1996].  So he had three months in '96 [1996].  So it's three years and three months.
Speaker 1: And he was killed in a plane--.
Speaker 2: Plane crash.
Speaker 1: Crash.  It was some--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) On a mission, on a trade mission.  He was taking a group of CEO's [Chief Executive Officers] to Croatia, Bosnia and all to do some--have them look at--at some opportunities for American businesses to do business over there.  And the plane--I don't know what actually happened. The pilots did not know that airport and you have to--apparently, you had to have had some experience flying into that airport manually.  You can't fly in on--with the controls or something.
Speaker 1: With the automatic.
Speaker 2: On the automatic, yeah.  And the pilot misjudged a turn and went into the mountain and everybody perished.
Story_ID: 4109
Speaker 1: We were talking about the amount of speculation of what really happened and you said your daughter [Tracey Brown]--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, my daughter wrote Ron's [husband, Ronald Brown] biography ['The Life and Time of Ron Brown: A Memoir'].  And because of that, she did an inordinate amount of research.  And I respect her judgment tremendously.  She's a lawyer.  And she's now working for Johnnie Cochran in New York [City, New York].  And she said, she found no evidence of the conspiracy that people had come up with.  And her view was, you have to consider the source, who it was coming from.  And it's--it had started with this guy by the name of [Christopher] Ruddy [news reporter]. Last name, Ruddy.  I can't remember his first name, whose a right-wing kind of--writes for one of these right-wing papers.  And he's the one that started it, and people like [Richard] Dick Gregory [civil rights activist/comedian] and a guy here that has a talk show.  I can't remember his name now.
Speaker 1: You talking about Joe Madison [radio commentator/activist]?
Speaker 2: Joe Madison picked it up and, in fact, I talked to Joe personally about it on the phone.  And I told him we have no evidence of that.  And he wanted to--to know why we didn't exhume the body.  And I said, "Because I have no reason to exhume it."  I said, "I don't believe that theory," you know.  "Consider who started it."  And these are the anti-Clinton [President William 'Bill' Clinton] people that were running around saying it.  Not Dick Gregory, but the--for some reason Dick and Joe Madison picked it up.
Speaker 1: It started on the right wing, and then it--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It started on the right wing and then bounced to the left wing, yeah.  And I said, once you know--you know, you know who started, I can't give it any credence.  I said, they don't care about Ron.  I mean they're not interested in, you know--this is all about trying to blame Clinton for it, you know.  So, I said, "We have no evidence of that.  I am not, you know, bringing his body up to, you know, to satisfy some right-wing somebody or other."  So Tracey's point, who I respect her opinion tremendously, she said, "Mom, Dad is gone.  I mean so what--why are we gonna go through this," you know, so--.
Speaker 1: So groups were actually calling you, asking you to exhume--.
Speaker 2: Well, Joe did.  I mean I talked with him about it, and to tell him to stop, you know, saying all this, you know, giving it, you know, more credence.  And he basically, he did.  He--he--he took my wishes into consideration and so they stopped.  But I mean it's--it was definitely out there.  And--and maybe if it had started with Joe and them, I might have given it, you know--you know, some consideration.  But I knew where it started, and that--I wasn't interested in doing anything with what they said.  And it was all during the time, you know, the investigation and all that.  And that was all about trying to get something on--on Clinton to use. I mean, it was, you know, that was the basis for everything.  Everything that went on during that--that time--.
Speaker 1: So people were alleging (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Was all about the President.
Speaker 1: That the President had something to do with the accident.
Speaker 2: Had something to do with it.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) (unclear)
Speaker 2: Yeah, with the accident, yes, exactly.  That's what, that's what they were saying.  So I didn't, you know, I wasn't along with that.  It was just foolishness, you know.  I mean, there was, they said, you know, they had Ron on a list of people that had died suspiciously, that had come in contact--come into contact with the Clintons [President William 'Bill' Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton].  You know, they had Vince Foster [attorney, worked for President Clinton] and they had some, several people in Arkansas and, oh, just different ones.  I mean it was ridiculous.  I wasn't buying into that, you know.  So, that's what that was.
Speaker 1: Okay. Has that been the most difficult part of dealing with this (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, yes, very much.
Speaker 1: On the upside, people--they seem to--have inspired a great of deal of respect--.
Speaker 2: Yeah, on the upside, there are any number of schools that were named after him and institutions and dinners, you know, the Ron Brown dinner or the Ron Brown award for this and the Ron Brown award for that.  So between awards and dinners and--and schools and institutions, you know, that wanted to be associated with him, that's been very fulfilling.

Speaker 1: In terms of your own career, now you have--you went from WKAS--.
Speaker 2: [W]KYS [-FM, Washington, D.C., radio station, 93.9].
Speaker 1: KYS, to you worked for Black Entertainment Television [BET].
Speaker 2: Well, I've done that with the bank.  We had a joint venture with BET to issue a Visa card [credit card].  And it was a joint venture between BET and Chevy Chase Bank.  And I was the Vice Chairman of the joint venture.  And we no longer have that joint venture so that has--we've since gotten rid of all of our credit cards.  So that's not ample any more.
Speaker 1: Okay. And--but you've been at Chevy Chase Bank for (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I've been here--this is the longest I've ever worked some place.  I've been at Chevy Chase.  I came here in '90--when did I start Chevy Chase, '94 [1994]?  Wait, I always have to think.  I have to use it with Ron's career.  He became Chairman [of the Democratic National Committee] in '89 [1989], and I was at KYS, '94 [1994].  I came here in '95 [1995], January '95, and I've been here what--what's that nine year, eight years
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It's the longest I've ever worked any place.  And I came here as a Vice President from KYS.  And then became a Senior Vice President when we had the joint venture with BET.
Story_ID: 4111
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Economic development--that we get ourselves together economically.  I think if I was to encourage my grandchildren who are ten [Morgan and Ryan Brown].  I have twin, identical twin boys, I would tell them to own their own business, to work toward having something of their own.  It's fine to work for somebody.  I don't, you know, I'm not saying don't do that,  but I think their end goal should be to have, have their own so that they can pass it down to their children, something to--that we can pass down.  And I think--that's why I look at Earl Graves [magazine publisher/entrepreneur] who I'm close and friendly with and Linda Johnson Rice [publisher/executive].  I think it's wonderful that they have their own business and they can pass it down to their children.  And--and everybody doesn't have to be big like that, you know, you can have a--whatever your little business is.  But I just think that's so important.  And if there's any--I mean it's too late for--well, it's not too late for my children [Michael and Tracey Brown].  I would still--if they could do that, I'd want them to do that as well.  You can learn how to run your own business by working for somebody else.  Then you learn what you don't want to do and what shouldn't be done and how to do things.  Then when you have your own business, you know how to--how to run it.  But that's what I think I would want--economic development, self-sufficiency for the black community.
Story_ID: 4112
Speaker 1: And you're still fairly young, I mean you're not--but we always ask this question at this point.  What would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I never thought of that.  My legacy.  Always there for my family.  I'm a big believer in family.  And I'm as close to my children [Michael and Tracey Brown] as I am to my friends, if not closer.  And I probably enjoy them more than I enjoy anybody else.  And I would want them to have the same feeling toward their children, not to be children are to be seen and not heard, you know.  I'm used to traveling with them.  I'm used to--even when Ron [husband, Ronald Brown]  was living, as old as they are, they went on--we all went together on vacation.  We still enjoyed family vacations.  And then when Michael got married, his wife [Tammy Brown] had to come along.  And she had to fit into the family.  I mean that was part of, you know, being--what we did.  Our families do--our family does everything together.  So I would say, family.  That would probably be the legacy I would want to leave for my children.
Speaker 1: I usually don't ask this question, but in this case, I will.  What would you think would be Ron Brown's legacy?
Speaker 2: His would be to--excuse me--to leave--what his, his little saying was, "leave the ladder down for somebody else to--to climb up," help young people.  He also believed in economic self-sufficiency.  And he truly believed in--in young people.  He--he was not one that didn't hire young people or stayed away from them or: "they can't show us anything."  He believed in young people, and he believed in women.  And I used to tell him all of the time, I would love to have worked for him.  He was a wonderful boss.  If you had him as a boss, particularly, I think if you were a woman, he was very sensitive to mothers with children, having to leave to, you know, take a child to the doctor or go to a school play or whatever it was.  You could--you could always leave the office if you had something to do with your kids.  He was not like some men are: "What, what do you mean, you're leaving?  You know, you have to be here from nine to five," whatever.  He's not like--he was not like that.  He was a very good boss, very good boss.  And he had people that had worked for him at the National Urban League when he got into commerce, were dying to come back to work for him, men and women because he was really good with people that way.  We used to tease him, the kids and I, teased him that he was wuss, you know, he was real easy (laughs).  But he got work out of people because he was--he was not a tyrant.  You know, some people get work out of you because they're a tyrant and they have their staffs intimidated all the time.  But he got work out of people for being the opposite.  And he appreciated people.  He appreciated everything people did and let them know it.  And I think in turn, they worked their butts off for him, you know.  So I would say, people would be his legacy, helping others, and young people.
Speaker 1: And the last question: how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I never thought of that either.  I guess as someone who was crazy about her family, would do anything for my children and my grandchildren [Morgan and Ryan Brown].  I'm gonna cry just saying it.  I get filled up. Because for the last six years, oh, gosh, seven, seven years, it's just been basically, Michael, Tracey, Tammy, that's my daughter-in-law, Morgan [grandson], Ryan [grandson] and myself.  I mean this is our little nucleus, you know.  And we've taken, we went through the accident together and took the hits together, and now are finally seeing the light together, you know, finally coming out of the darkness of all of that.  And, so I would say just someone that was totally into her family.
