LIZ LUNDEEN:  Today is August 9th, 2012.  I&#8217;m Liz Lundeen of the Southern Oral History Program, and I&#8217;m here with Sally Buckner at her home in Cary, North Carolina.  I just thought we&#8217;d get started by talking about your early life, about where you grew up, if you could say something about your parents or siblings.  SALLY BUCKNER:  Okay.  I was born in Statesville, North Carolina, but when I was four we moved to Albemarle.  That&#8217;s where I got my public school education.  And my parents were middle class, practically even lower middle class.  My father was a plumber, and my mother, like most mothers of that day, was a homemaker.  They had both been brought up quite poor.  My father didn&#8217;t feel it so badly.  His parents were very psychologically healthy people&#8212;a very happy family.  So they just didn&#8217;t feel it so badly.  My mother felt it terribly because her father, well, he drank too much, and when it was a bad year, he really drank a lot and so things were hard.  She equated poverty with losing control.  She was very worried about money all her life.  [They] also belonged to a very fundamentalist church.  She fought that her whole life.  She fought fundamentalism, bless her heart.    I've often said the technological advance which has hurt the family the most is not television. It&#8217;s the dishwasher because I learned so much by drying dishes while my mother washed them.  We would talk about everything, and she would talk about religious things, political things.  She thought Franklin Roosevelt was just like Moses to save us from&#8212; not to lead us out of slavery but to lead us out of the Depression.  She made me interested in politics because she talked about that.  She was also way ahead of her time in recognizing that we were treating minorities badly.  My father as I said was a plumber, and every day he would come home for lunch, and usually his assistant would be in the car with him.  And mother would say, &#8220;You know Clyde is just as good a plumber as your daddy, but he&#8217;ll never be anything but an assistant because he&#8217;s colored and that&#8217;s just not fair.&#8221;  So she was well ahead of her time, especially for a woman.  She had gotten one-year [of] teacher training after she finished high school.  Her father wouldn&#8217;t pay for anything more than that.  She wanted to go to college worse than anything in the world but never got there, but she read widely and she thought deeply.  In fact that&#8217;s a picture of her right there in the high school graduating class.    LL:  Wow, it&#8217;s very small.  SB:  Yeah, right.  LL:  Wow, and what about your dad?  What did he think of your mom&#8217;s progressive view on race and&#8212;  SB:  My dad, he just went along.  He was not much of a talker.  I've often said he never once said I love you; I never one second doubted it because he was a deeply loving man.  He loved my mother, and they had a very, very happy marriage, good marriage.  He never fought any of her progressive views in any way.
LL:  So what were their expectations [for] you, in terms of growing up?  Did you think you would go to college?  Was education important?  SB:  Oh definitely, I was going to college.  Mother had a jar into which she put every cent that was extra, and because she couldn&#8217;t go to college she wanted more than anything for me and my brother and sister to go.    LL:  Yeah.  And you were the oldest?  Is that right?  SB:  Mm-hmm.  LL:  And so how did you decide to go to Woman&#8217;s College at Greensboro?  SB:  Well, I looked at several. I really wanted to go to Carolina [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill] and major in journalism.  But Carolina didn&#8217;t take any women the first two years.  LL:  You had to be a junior, right.  SB:  Had to be a junior.  LL:  Before women could get&#8212;.  SB:  I thought about Catawba.  It was close to home and I liked the idea it was a co-ed college and everything.  But several of my friends were going to Woman&#8217;s College so I went, and by the time I'd been there two years you couldn&#8217;t have pulled me away.  It was wonderful.  LL:  You know that&#8217;s the same thing Emily Wilson said the other day.  She said, &#8220;I wanted to go to UNC and study journalism, but after two years there was no way I was transferring.&#8221;    SB:  Isn&#8217;t that funny.  LL:  So tell me a little bit about what life was like at Woman&#8217;s College.  What kind of activities were you involved in?  What did you study?  SB:  Well, I was an English major because I always wanted to be a journalist or a writer of some sort.  The major activity was the newspaper.  I joined it freshman year and was thrilled when I got a byline on my first story, which was not a great story.  LL:  Do you remember what it was?  SB:  It was an interview with somebody.  I don&#8217;t remember who it was.  And I was active in a few other things but that was the main [activity], that and the Wesley Foundation which I deeply loved.  It sort of gave me a home away from home in a way.  And of course Wesley Foundation being Methodist, founded on John Wesley&#8217;s social justice gospel, that, of course, had a big effect on me, and I took the magazine, which was written for college students at that time.  I doubt if it is now.  It was called Motive.  And it brought up all sorts of social issues.  For instance it brought up imprisonment.  Well, it never occurred to me to think of imprisonment.  Of course you sent someone to prison when they do something bad.  But then I learned more about it.  We had lots of discussions at Wesley Foundation about social issues.  That was one of the things.  The newspaper was not particularly, we didn&#8217;t particularly bring in outside matters.  But the editor ahead of me, Rosemary Boney, who later was married to the editor of the Charlotte Observer, whose name I have nicely repressed&#8212;she took on John Clark who was, I think it was John Clark.  He was the main manager, main owner&#8212;have you heard this story?  LL:  I think you briefly mentioned it in the materials you sent me but please, please tell it for the tape.  SB:  Okay.  He was writing [to] businesses around [the area] to give names of students who he wanted blacklisted for any jobs because they had joined things like the Students for Democratic Society or other liberal groups.  And she took him on, which I thought was remarkably brave of her.  She took him on, and the Daily Tarheel [the UNC-Chapel Hill student newspaper] didn&#8217;t, or maybe the Daily Tarheel followed her.  But she was the one, and that was impressive to me that she would have that sort of courage.  So that was a model right there.  She probably doesn&#8217;t know she was.  Now I&#8217;m not sure, I think she&#8217;s still living in North Carolina.  I think she may be in Charlotte.  You can find out the name of the [husband]; he was editor for a long time.  They were divorced.  I think you&#8217;ll find out her name or you can find out through the Woman&#8217;s College.  Anyhow so when I got out I was burning with the desire to make a difference; somehow I was going to make a difference.  LL:  So was Jim Clark, was he labeling the students communists?  SB:  Essentially.  LL:  Essentially even without using the word.  SB:  Or favoring communism.  LL:  Favoring communism.    SB:  I don&#8217;t remember. If we get time to look, I gave myself a graduation gift, and I was the editor the next year.  I had all my issues plus several of the previous issues bound.  I may have one which Rosemary attacked him.  LL:  So this would&#8217;ve been&#8212;you were at college [19]49 through [19]53.  Is that accurate?  SB:  That&#8217;s right.  It would&#8217;ve been in [19]52 when she took this on.  LL:  So you mentioned that Clark was blackballing students.  I&#8217;m just curious if you can say what student activism was like, if not at Woman&#8217;s College, [then] at other surrounding universities.  SB:  It was so mild.  I don&#8217;t even know what it was.  It&#8217;s not like it was in the [19]60s where you had the black student movement and all sorts of other student movements.  I honestly cannot say.  LL:  He thought it was significant but&#8212;  SB:  He thought it was significant, and this was during the time, I mean, the anti-communist fever hit right after World War Two because everyone was worried about Russia and China, and Russia got the atom bomb right away.  So that worried us.  Of course my feeling is if you want to be a communist, be a communist.  Just speak up if you&#8217;re a communist. If we know about it, we can watch out for you if we need to.  Although I don&#8217;t see anything wrong with believing in communist ideas anyhow as long as you don&#8217;t try to overthrow the government.  But you see, I&#8217;m a liberal.  LL:  And can you say a little bit more about some of the social issues? You mentioned imprisonment that the Wesley Foundation took up.  I&#8217;m curious as to what the stance was on race at the time?  SB:  Oh we talked about it.  This was not the Foundation per se, but it connected with Warren Ashby, who was a professor at UNC-G [then, Woman&#8217;s College], I will be surprised if Emily Wilson didn&#8217;t have him.  He was head of the philosophy department.  Do you remember her mentioning him?  LL:  I think the name, yeah.  SB:  He became my mentor.  He had become ordained as a Methodist minister.  I don&#8217;t think he ever served as one.  He immediately went to grad school and got his doctorate in philosophy.  He started the philosophy department at UNC-G and was very active.  If you go back through Greensboro records, the Greensboro Daily, he was the one people were [attacking]. They were burning crosses in front of his yard as far as I know.  But what he did while I was there was to have meetings of selected students, ones who would be interested, to come to his home and have some refreshments and conversation with students from Bennett and [North Carolina] A&amp;T, those black students.  I&#8217;m not sure whether Greensboro College was included or not because it was another white woman&#8217;s college.  I did that my whole [junior] year, and then the next year we did it at the home of his best friend, Bill Mueller.  Warren went off on a visiting professorship somewhere.  He still remains one of the highlights of my life.  He married me and my husband, and I kept up with him his entire life.    LL:  So what kinds of things would you talk about in these gatherings?  SB:  I honestly cannot tell you.  I think it was a matter not so much of getting action going, but helping us to know each other as human beings, as full human beings with the same interests and the same anxieties and so forth.  LL:  And there were men and women.    SB:  It was men and women. I&#8217;m sure other people&#8212;Emily could probably tell you some of the things he did during her time there, which was more during the fervent [19]60s&#8212;  LL:  [19]60s, yeah.  SB:  There were all sorts of terrible things written about him in the paper, letters to the editor et cetera, et cetera.  So he was a huge influence.  LL:  I bet.  Yeah, absolutely.  So when you were at Woman&#8217;s College what did you think that you would do afterward?  Did you have a clear career path?  I know you said you wanted to be a journalist or writer.  SB:  The clearest was to be a journalist, but after I got married, I got pregnant very soon thereafter.  I taught school for one year and then got married and got pregnant immediately thereafter.  And I was old-fashioned enough to think I ought to stay home with my children.  There weren&#8217;t many options for getting help anyhow.  So I didn&#8217;t take a journalistic job until about let&#8217;s see, ten years later when we moved to Raleigh.  I got to know Sam Ragan.  Are you familiar with him?  LL:  Again, from what you sent me.    SB:  Well, he was another liberal&#8217;s liberal and a wonderful human being.  And he gave me a part-time job at the Raleigh Times, of all things on the Woman&#8217;s Page, which I was about as interested in&#8212; It&#8217;s hard to say anything I was less interested in.  But I took it, and I eventually I was editor of the entertainment supplement, which came out each Saturday by the time I left.  But the pay was miniscule, and I found out what the pay was for full-timers, and it was miniscule too. I just didn&#8217;t see that I could work for that.  So I went back to grad school, got my master&#8217;s at [North Carolina] State [University], immediately started teaching at Peace [College] and four years later realized I knew a lot about teaching literature, but I was teaching writing by hunches more than anything else.  So I was lucky enough to get a National Endowment Humanities Fellowship to go back and study language and language learning and how language developed, every aspect of language.  It was wonderful.  LL:  And that was at UNC [Chapel Hill].  SB:  At UNC.  They did not have&#8212; If I were going now, I would ask to major in rhetoric.  They didn&#8217;t have rhetoric majors anywhere.  While I was at UNC, that first year, before I started on my doctorate, I think it was Newsweek came out with an article, a cover article, &#8220;Why Johnny Can&#8217;t Write.&#8221; It was a long one about how badly writing was taught and how most teachers were giving tests, with the bubbles&#8212;tick off the right answers&#8212;instead of teaching writing, which teaches you to think.  I'd get really irritated when people talk about, &#8220;Oh, he can&#8217;t spell.  He&#8217;s not a good writer.&#8221;  He might be a wonderful [writer].  In fact one of my best friends couldn&#8217;t spell his name unless he thought about it twice.  His son was dyslexic so I&#8217;m assuming that&#8217;s what he [was].  And he was a brilliant, brilliant man who wrote very, very well.  So then I went back and started on my doctorate and Carolina was very kind.  I got it in education and curriculum instruction, but they let me put together courses at Carolina, State and Duke, and I went to get as much as I could.  It was really good.  LL:  So I&#8217;m wondering if we can just go back a little bit to when you were coming out of Woman&#8217;s College and leading up to your time in Raleigh?  You were the caregiver, I mean you took care of your children right after&#8212;.  SB:  For a while.  LL:  For a while.  Was it apparent that your oldest son had a condition from when he was young?  SB:  In a way it was, although I just thought he was very susceptible to germs.  He would have really, really severe sore throats.  When he was eight years old, he had one and I took him to the doctor, and I think they gave him something and [I] brought him back home.  He didn&#8217;t come for supper, and I went back there and I couldn&#8217;t wake him up.  So I called the doctor.  In those days doctors even came to your house.  He came immediately.  He said, &#8220;We need to get him to the hospital; he&#8217;s dehydrated.&#8221;  By the time he came to Raleigh he was having enough of those that the doctor told me don&#8217;t wait until he gets sick, really sick.  Bring him straight to the hospital, and they would put him on an IV.  They didn&#8217;t know what it was.  It turned out to be Addison&#8217;s disease, which is connected with, it&#8217;s something that any man with adrenomyeloneuropathy gets.  And we had no idea.  We took him almost through high school before it was diagnosed.    LL:  I imagine that took a lot of time.  SB:  It took a lot of time and energy and plus the fact that I had an autistic daughter.  And that took a lot of time and energy.  We went to Chapel Hill twice a week for a long time until I realized that the woman was completely Freudian and had no inkling of what was going on with my daughter.  Finally we got out of that.  We took her everywhere.  You name a diagnosis, I can give it to you.  But finally we realized it was autism from a little article in the paper, real small article.  I went over to Division TEACH&#8212;which was not even Division TEACH then, it was just a program at UNC&#8212;to interview Dr. Eric Schopler, who is one of the saints on this earth.  He and his partner Dr. Bob Reichler had started a program. Instead of saying autism is caused by the parents, they enlisted the parents as well as therapists, and you&#8217;d go and watch a therapist work with your child through a one-way glass. And then through that you&#8217;d work out things you could do at home.  It was absolutely magnificent.  So from then on she began to make some progress.  I look at what&#8217;s available now and I could weep of course, because she would&#8217;ve made a lot more progress with this.  But&#8212;  LL:  And that was in the [19]70s.  SB:  This was in the, she was born in, it was the [19]60s [actually, the 1950s]  LL:  In the [19]60s.    SB:  In the [19]60s [actually, the 1950s].  And I was working as a volunteer with the mental health association in Raleigh or the Mental Health Society I guess it was.  I found out there was going to be a national conference, I think it was the very first conference, on autism.  And I went to it and saw Dr. Schopler again there, and I said, &#8220;We need to start a chapter in North Carolina.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;The parents I&#8217;m working with are so overwhelmed just working with their kids I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;  But by six months later he called me he said, &#8220;You&#8217;re right.  We&#8217;re going to do it.&#8221;  So Bob and I became charter members of that and helped get it going.  We found out that Dr. Schopler&#8217;s program was [funded] on soft money and didn&#8217;t know whether they were going to be able to continue.  The parents, we all talked and we said, &#8220;This ought to be a state program and ought to be sponsored by the state.  How can we do that?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Well, I know a legislator that I met in Goldsboro.&#8221;  I just barely met her.  We weren&#8217;t friends or anything.  But I said, &#8220;She&#8217;s a real hotshot and let me ask her.&#8221;  She was a wonder.  It&#8217;s too bad that she isn&#8217;t here for you to interview.  She was about four feet eight [inches], I guess.  She was a farmer&#8217;s wife.  Her husband died early; she took over the farm and was such success she became president of the state grange.  Then she became a legislator, and she was a hot little number.  And I called her and told her what we wanted and I said, &#8220;We need to get their attention.  How do we do it?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Feed them.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Really?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Yes, and do it early before the truckers come in and take them to the Angus Barn.  Do it early.&#8221;  So we got Wesley Foundation&#8212;we belonged to a Methodist church at that time, which housed Wesley Foundation&#8212;and we asked if they&#8217;d like to make some money by hosting a country breakfast, and we sent out the letters just as soon as we could before the next legislative session began.  Dr. Schopler and his group had put together a film showing a number of things but also showing&#8212;there was one real success story they had.  A kid who had been banging his head and not speaking and everything was turning out to be really competent.  And they had a film to show that.  We had the breakfast with scrambled eggs and country ham and the works.  We brought some of the children in to sit with them.  And one of the autistic boys took his plate and dumped it into a legislator&#8217;s lap.  The legislator said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do something about these kids.&#8221;  From there comes Division TEACH.  LL:  Aha, so it worked.  SB:  It worked wonderfully for years.  Now right now, you know, it&#8217;s a national scandal on how much autism has increased or we&#8217;re diagnosing it better or something.  But at that time I remember a friend of mine said his kid was misbehaving and he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t mind him.  He&#8217;s autistic.&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Artistic?  I don&#8217;t care how artistic he is.&#8221;  People didn&#8217;t know what autistic was.    LL:  They had no idea.  SB:  Even doctors, a lot of doctors didn&#8217;t really know what it was at that time.  LL:  So would you say the parents that were active and trying to get this group started, was it the moms and the dads?    SB:  Oh yeah.  It was the moms and the dads and they worked really hard.  I had not been as active with the society, as my daughter was growing, as she got older, but I&#8217;m on the autism services board now.    LL:  Great.  So what took you to Goldsboro?  I&#8217;m just curious.  SB:  My husband&#8217;s job.  He was a recreation director, and he got the head job there.  In fact he started the recreation department there.    LL:  Well you had mentioned something in the materials you sent me about the Women&#8217;s Goodwill Committee in Goldsboro.  SB: : Yes.  LL:  I&#8217;m very curious to hear you talk about that a little bit.  SB:  Well, this was at the time of the heart of the civil rights movement because we moved there in [19]65.  So this was the heart of the civil rights movement.  Bob was in charge of the whole recreation program for that matter, but one thing he was in charge of was a community building which had a pool and basketball court and so forth for recreation.  I talked to him about integrating it.  He said, &#8220;Well, I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to go right now.&#8221;  Goldsboro at that time [was] very, very conservative.  There were some wonderful, wonderful people there and some wonderful bright minds but as a whole it was a very conservative place. Well, Barbara Berkeley, she married the son of the mayor.  Her husband was a doctor.  Bruce, I think is his first name.  Scott, I think was the mayor&#8217;s name.  And so she had a lot of influence by being in that social class.  She started a Woman&#8217;s Goodwill Committee; she invited a number of black women and a number of white women to get together and just talk about what was going on in the country and how we could help things move ahead but move ahead peacefully.  Of course we didn&#8217;t want any riots if we could help it.  We didn&#8217;t take any firm action.  It was almost like what Warren Ashby had done.  It was a matter of getting to know each other.  LL:  Discussions.  SB:  Bring them into our homes, go to their places.  The reason I said she should be looked at afterwards&#8212;I don&#8217;t know what did she thereafter, but she started a soup kitchen in the Episcopal Church there and has run it for years for the homeless.  She&#8217;s a wonderful woman.  LL:  So tell me a little bit more about what these meetings were like.  Do you recall how Barbara was able to reach out and get African American women to come to these groups?  SB:  I have no idea how she did that except with her father-in-law being the mayor, he knew who was influential and he would&#8217;ve been able to help her to pick out people.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it wasn&#8217;t done through churches.    LL:  And did you get the sense that the black women who were involved were minister&#8217;s wives or middle class?  SB:  They were middle to upper class as much as blacks were allowed to be upper class in those days.    LL:  Yeah, exactly.  SB:  Yeah.  Middle to upper class.  LL:  So were you talking about integration of the schools; were you talking about sit-ins?  I mean what kind of issues.  SB:  You&#8217;re asking me to think back forty-five years.  LL:  No, no.  I understand.  It&#8217;s okay.    SB:  I can&#8217;t be specific about that except that all the meetings were congenial, and we spoke seriously but tactfully to one another, and it felt really good to have that sort of movement.  It was a first step.    LL:  Right, absolutely.  SB:  It was not a revolution.  LL:  Yeah.  No, no.  But it&#8217;s so important.  You said you left Goldsboro in [19]65?  SB:  That&#8217;s when my husband got another job here in Raleigh.    LL:  You came to Raleigh.  SB:  It was a state job.    LL:  In Raleigh.  So you were in Goldsboro I&#8217;m guessing during the sit-ins in Greensboro when the student movement got started?  SB:  Yeah, we would&#8217;ve been.  And we took the Greensboro paper so I was very much aware of what was going on in Greensboro.  LL:  Was it a surprise to you at all that all of that started in Greensboro?  SB:  No, because Warren Ashby was there.    LL: He was there.  Exactly.  SB:  And I doubt very seriously that he started the sit-ins but this was ten to twelve years after I had finished college and I wouldn&#8217;t be at all surprised if some of those leaders had been people who had been in his home.  Yeah.  LL:  Wow.  Yeah.  I can imagine just looking, you were able to look back and see that you had been in Greensboro and then all of that happened.  SB:  And again, I think double checking with Emily you would get more information there because she would&#8217;ve known&#8212;  LL:  At the time.  SB:  At the time, yeah.  LL:  So what other memories do you have of the movement, of the civil rights movement, specifically, or other organizations that you were working with that took stances on civil rights or talked about it?  SB:  Okay.  I was not as active in the civil rights movement as I would&#8217;ve liked to have been.  I was beginning, I was either working or going to college and working at the same time.  LL:  I can imagine.  SB:  And dealing with an autistic child and a son with a lot of sicknesses.  So I really wasn&#8217;t very active in the civil rights movement.  I read a lot.  I talked a lot to people and when we would gather in my church, I spoke as much as I could.  It was not a particularly progressive church.  It was a Methodist church.  John Wesley is twirling in his grave because the Methodists have given up their front seat in the social justice movement.  That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re members of Pullen [Memorial Baptist Church in Raleigh].  LL:  Of Pullen.  Yeah.    SB:  I supported it as best I could, but I didn&#8217;t do it, I didn&#8217;t even write letters to the editor or anything at that time.  I remember when Bob was in, well, this is not the civil rights movement.  This was the Vietnamese war.  Soon after we moved here, the very first class I took was a night class and it was easy to take.  I took a creative writing class under Guy Owen, who was a very definite liberal and very active in groups that were opposing the Vietnamese war and were for civil rights.  And he invited me to a meeting and the meeting turned out they were going to have a, it wasn&#8217;t a sit-in.  It was a stand up.  LL:  A march or protest?  SB:  Just standing in front of the post office downtown Raleigh holding up signs against the Vietnamese war, and so I did that.  I did it one time and Bob&#8217;s manager of his state office let him know that he was displeased.  And so I didn&#8217;t do it again.  If it had been my boss, I would&#8217;ve argued or I would&#8217;ve done it anyhow.  But since it was Bob&#8217;s, I didn&#8217;t feel like I could put him in that situation.  But I continued to go to meetings with the group and that sort of thing.  I didn&#8217;t get involved in the actual sit-ins, demonstrations, marches et cetera until the equal rights movement.  I was one of those among the thousands at the Capitol for that.  Since then I've participated in a number of them against the death penalty, against the Vietnamese War, lord, against the Iraq War.  By that time my husband had gotten involved, too.  He didn&#8217;t care what&#8212;  LL:  What his boss [thought].  He was retired at that point.  SB:  Yeah, well, he may have been or he may have&#8212;the boss had changed and things had changed.  There were a lot of people against the Vietnamese war, and it wasn&#8217;t as&#8212; The South was so touchy about civil rights.  It wasn&#8217;t as touchy about the Vietnamese War.  But my son, I have a picture of him on my, right up there on the wall.  For Mother&#8217;s Day a few years ago he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to take you to the Million Mom March.&#8221;  So that&#8217;s what we did.  The Million Mom March.  I belonged to that and we had a local chapter, a state chapter and a wonderful woman Rachel Smith, who is another person you might want to know.  She&#8217;s been real active in anti-violence things.  Going down to places where someone has been murdered and having a prayer vigil there and things like that.  She became a minister just so&#8212;she had had a lot of [difficulty] getting herself completely ordained, but she felt it would give more oomph to her participation if she were a minister.  But she&#8217;s a wonderful person, she and her husband both.    LL:  You said that you got involved in the ERA marches and all that.  Can you say a little bit about what turned you on to the women&#8217;s movement or when did you feel&#8212;   SB:  I was my mother&#8217;s daughter.  I believe in fairness.  My mother believed in justice almost beyond any other virtue, fairness.  You treat everybody fairly.  You treat your classmates fairly.  You treat everybody fairly.  And it was clear that women were not being treated well and seeing&#8212; It still seems a no-brainer to me and a constitutional no-brainer, for that matter.  I can&#8217;t see why on earth, I don&#8217;t know why we haven&#8217;t brought it up again but we haven&#8217;t.  And now is not a good time with the kind of Tea Party stuff we&#8217;ve got going on.  And interestingly enough the Edenton Tea Party&#8212;do you know about the Edenton&#8212;?  LL:  Mm-hmm.  SB:  That was women declaring their independence.  LL:  Right here in North Carolina.  SB:  Right here in North Carolina.  I never was a big part of NARAL or even the other organizations.  I didn&#8217;t join any of the organizations.  I may have sent them some checks.  I was not always comfortable with the more in-your-face demonstrations, burning bras and wearing see-through blouses and that sort of thing.  I felt that was sort of tacky and really it was more off-putting than it was&#8212;.  And I feel that way about the gay/lesbian movement, although that&#8217;s one I've gotten real active in in recent years.  Some of my best friends are lesbians and [I] have some gay friends too.  They aren&#8217;t as close.  I think it&#8217;s important to make a statement, but I just don&#8217;t like in-your-face stuff.    LL:  Yeah.  So there&#8217;s a lot of lobbying on behalf of the ERA and organizations&#8212;  SB:  Writing letters [and op-eds].  LL:  Making speeches.  SB:  Making phone calls.  LL:  Exactly.  So that&#8217;s kind of what you were&#8212;  SB:  Yeah.  LL:  Active in?  SB:  And the demonstrations, yeah.  LL:  Yeah, at the Capitol.  So what was that all like.  Do you have any reflection on being a part of that?  SB:  Again, life was incredibly busy at that time because we were learning what my son had was not just Addison&#8217;s disease but this crippling disease.  So there was a big problem, and then my daughter, she&#8217;d finished high school, and we were trying to find a place for her in society.  And we were trying all sorts of educational things.  Goodwill has a school in Winston-Salem.  We sent her to that; that didn&#8217;t work out.  I can&#8217;t even think of what it&#8217;s called&#8212;the governmental organization that helps people with disabilities or sicknesses.  They help them get jobs.  It starts with a V [vocational rehabilitation].  I can&#8217;t think of it.  Anyhow, it&#8217;s a state organization.  Worked with them for a while.  She passed with flying colors, but she couldn&#8217;t hold a job.  Well, finally the Autism Society, the woman who later turned out to be head of it for some years would come, and Sally Lynn was then working at Life Experiences.  Do you know about it?  LL:  It sounds familiar.  SB:  Okay.  It&#8217;s an organization and we supported it for a while, too.  It&#8217;s an organization that was meant to give meaningful work to people.  They started out as a bakery, and then they started doing other things too, and actually she got paid, but we paid for her.  We paid more than she got paid.  And this woman said, &#8220;I think Sally could be meaningfully employed in the regular marketplace.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think so because she&#8217;d had several jobs and lost them almost immediately.&#8221;  And it always upset her terribly when she lost them.  But the Autism Society was smart enough that they had job coaches who would go on the job with her, and within six weeks she was a star employee because she knew everything to do.  If you know anything about autistic persons, they want everything just the same.  They want a regular routine, and once you learn that routine, it&#8217;s perfect.  But they can&#8217;t think of it themselves.  And just being told one time isn't going to do it.  So she&#8217;s been employed for about twenty-five years now at Springmore in the dining services.  So I don&#8217;t know what question you were on.  LL:  We were talking about the ERA, just what it was like to&#8212;  SB:  And that&#8217;s another reason I was on the sidelines because my son was having all these terrible illnesses.    LL:  Absolutely.  SB:  Then we finally in 1986 we found out what the illness was, and we went to Kennedy-Krieger Institute, which is connected with Johns Hopkins and had tests and yes, we indeed had adrenomyeloneuropathy&#8212;ten syllables and no treatments.  But I, my son and my sister had all participated in altogether six different research projects up there, none of which have given us any treatment, but anyhow, we know what doesn&#8217;t work.    LL:  So you, I mean obviously were very, very busy but you still participated in this march on the Capitol and&#8212;  SB:  Yeah sort of doing what I could do.  LL:  So did you identify with the term feminist?  SB:  Yes. I identified with the term.  I have a friend here, she&#8217;s Presbyterian minister.  She&#8217;s several years older than I.  She&#8217;ll always introduce me and say, &#8220;She&#8217;s the other feminist besides me here.&#8221;   LL:  Well, that must be a good&#8212;  SB:  And very left wing.  My church has two lesbian ministers, as a matter of fact, and any other number of real feminists.    LL:  Well, I&#8217;m curious if you could say a bit more about your time at Chapel Hill when you were working on your PhD and what you perceived of the university and your own career trajectory when you were there.  I mean you knew that you wanted to teach.  You had already been teaching then.  SB:  At that time I knew I wanted to teach and I loved to teach.  I knew it paid better than to work at the News and Observer unless you really climbed that ladder fast, and it would give me better hours too, better hours.  Golly, I don&#8217;t know what to say except I loved, the year I was away from college not teaching, just going to class and everything, that was just absolutely wonderful.  If I had been a wealthy woman I would&#8217;ve just added college degrees throughout my life.  LL:  It&#8217;s nice, isn&#8217;t it?  SB:  Yeah, later on I was going [to school] either at night or I was going the one day or the two days I didn&#8217;t have [to teach] class.  LL:  So you were teaching at Peace, full-time?  SB:  I was teaching at Peace and going&#8212;so it took me from [19]74 to [19]80 to finish the course.  LL:  That&#8217;s pretty short considering that you were doing other things.  SB:  I had a lot of incompletes, but they were very kind and they understood my situation.  LL:  I&#8217;m just curious if you can say a little bit more about the importance of writing in terms of how&#8212; You obviously taught people to write and I&#8217;m curious if you have any success stories of how writing was really important for students, what it did for them?  SB:  Well, I noticed two or three students were going through some really hard times.  They said the journals they kept were like a stalwart something they could grab on to, that held them, they could do it.  I heard last night &#8211; I was watching that show The War on PBS &#8211; and there was this one man who had come back and for years he had suffered and suffered and suffered PTSD we call it now.  He finally wrote a book about it, and he was able to come to terms with it at that time.  So a lot of students there would come to college and their parents would decide, okay the kids are in college now we can break up.  Well, hah!  It hurts them just as much then as if they were at home.  And then there would be other things.  I think some of them were concerned about their sexuality.  In fact a couple of them wrote about that.  So journals were really important for the freshmen.  For the sophomores, I guess, I was either a preacher or a protestor or a something in my literature classes because when I taught, I was always looking for the principles, the moral principles undergirding the literature: For example, what is real evil anyhow? Who are the really evil people, as in the case of The Scarlet Letter, which you probably remember from eleventh grade.  Hester Prynne wasn&#8217;t the real sinner.  The real sinner was her husband because he was so cold.  He had no heart, and she had a very giving heart.  So every time that I found a story that that was the moral, I mean I would use that.  I&#8217;ll admit to using my teaching by teaching principles.  The principles of justice, principles of decency, of love.  LL:  Equality would you say?  SB:  Hmm?  LL:  Equality?  SB:  Oh absolutely.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  And I've never gotten into any trouble over it.    LL:  That&#8217;s good.  SB:  And the books I wrote, I did, I brought them up [gesturing toward a stack of books on coffee table].  Take a look.  I wrote a book of poetry and then I wrote this.  I compiled this [Our Words, Our Ways: Reading and Writing in North Carolina].  It&#8217;s a book to go along with eighth grade studies of North Carolina history.  And I tried to choose writings that would&#8212; in eighth grade you need to be teaching kids how to behave&#8212;teach them something about decency and justice and so forth.  There&#8217;s a story in there of course about George Moses Horton, the black poet, and I chose two of his poems that talk about being free, not being free.  What it was like to be a slave.  And then there&#8217;s this column by Dennis Rogers who used to be with the News and Observer and a really, really good columnist, about picking up a boy, I&#8217;m not sure if he was black or not, but his name too was George, which was interesting.  He had dropped out of school, and he was going to be joining the circus, and you knew this kid was doomed.  And so you could teach those two together and they make a nice pair, because George Moses Horton, he never won his freedom, and he did drink too much but he fought for decency and freedom his whole life and he made a name for himself, for a Southern black poet that really published.  LL: So Our Words Our Ways is the collection of&#8212;  SB:  Of writings that follow our history.  LL:  Writings from North Carolina.  SB:  You might have a poem about Manteo for instance, real early in the book written by someone who is still alive, but it&#8217;s that time.  And I had to do the teacher&#8217;s guide twice, that&#8217;s the second edition.  The second time I did it they were having a big deal about teaching values in school. So for each lesson I put in how it contributed to a study of values and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything in there that doesn&#8217;t in some way.  I've written two other collections of poetry.  This one&#8217;s the most in your face, activist.  It&#8217;s all anti-war.  LL:  Collateral Damage.  SB:  Yes, all anti-war. And then I wrote this one last Christmas, I finally put together something a lot of friends asked me to put together.  I used to write Christmas poems every year and I finally put them together and got them published.  And I looked through it just to see and yes, I have one in there that&#8217;s called &#8220;Carol for Bethlehem.&#8221;  One of the things my husband and I got&#8212;I need to back up.  My husband had gone with me on some of these marches and things, but he wasn&#8217;t a really enthusiastic activist.  But 9/11 [September 11, 2001] was really turning on and he started reading everything he could get.  He decided the real reason that people in the Middle East hate us is because of our treatment of Israel and Palestine, because we favor Israel so much and ignore the Palestinian plight.  And so we&#8217;ve joined two organizations which I mentioned in there, Triangle Tikkun and the Coalition [for Peace and Justice], both of them trying to educate people about what&#8217;s really going on there.  We get some wonderful speakers, but unfortunately usually they&#8217;re speaking to the choir.  Usually we can&#8217;t get the people who are not interested.  But this one is, &#8220;Oh broken town of Bethlehem where Holy star light glowed. / The shards of shattered promises defy both quiet roads. / Both east and west are trembling with the rumbling of the drums / and swords are drawn and fortunes pawned in war&#8217;s delirium.&#8221;  You can sing that to the old [tune], &#8220;Little Town of Bethlehem&#8221;.    LL:  I bet.  It sounds just like the right beat  SB:  So even a Christmas poem is an activist poem.  LL:  Absolutely, yeah.  Can you say a little bit more about when and how you got involved in the peace movement?  Obviously 9/11 was a catalyst for your husband.    SB:  Yeah, well, I had been with the Vietnam.  LL:  So you kind of continued to think about that right on through.  SB:  Just continued.  And I have all sorts of photos of us at the big march that we had just before the Iraq War broke out.  I opposed that absolutely, even the Vietnamese War wasn&#8217;t as unnecessary as this one was.  And it was so, don&#8217;t get me started.  Okay.  So write letters, go to marches.  I wrote an op-ed piece.  I've written several op-ed pieces for the News and Observer and I wrote one that got several angry responses.  I think it got one or two for me too.  And I had been doing some reading and I put it all together.  In the summer before 9/11, the National Security Council said, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got warnings.&#8221; You hear about this every once in a while that there will be what they call a lot of static about possible hits.  And they got real warning that there was a plan and even that they were going to use airplanes.  It got worse and worse, and they even almost could say soon.  And they ignored it.  And so I wrote this and ended up with what, when you look at this, what conclusion can you come to?  Shear incompetence.  So I got some ugly letters.  LL:  You got ugly letters back to you.  SB:  Yeah, that&#8217;s okay.  I can stand, I can live with ugly letters.  I've written some other op-ed pieces.  I haven&#8217;t written, I have not written as much of that.  My son died four years ago and the next year his father died.  So&#8212;  LL:  I&#8217;m sorry.  SB:  The next two years were sort of a blur.  They just went by.  I do a lot on the computer.  We have a liberal cohort that we talk back and forth.  LL:  Here at Glenaire.  SB:  No.    LL:  Oh, in the church.  SB:  In the church but friends, just friends.  In fact after the last election when Obama was elected, one of our friends who has nothing to do with the church or Glenaire, friends we&#8217;ve had for ages.  [They] said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s us liberals get together and celebrate,&#8221; so I went to their house, and I met one guy who I had never known before, never laid eyes on, never heard of him.  We have become three times a day email friends, sending each other articles and making comments and so forth.  So I do a lot of that, but I also do a lot of signing petitions and writing letters and making phone calls about various things.  I've been trying to make one about our tendency toward violence and guns.  I've belong[ed] to the Brady campaign forever and Amnesty International, I would put their little signs up on my bulletin board on my door at Peace and people would ask me about them.  So I do a lot of that.  LL:  I&#8217;m wondering, you taught at Peace for thirty years, is that&#8212;?  SB:  Twenty-eight years.  LL:  Twenty-eight.  Can you say a little bit about, did you see a changing role in the woman&#8217;s college over that time?  Now it&#8217;s co-ed, right?  SB:  Yes.  And a lot of people are really upset about being co-ed.  I&#8217;m sorry that they went co-ed because I went to Woman&#8217;s College, and I taught at Peace for twenty-eight years as a woman&#8217;s college and I know&#8212;and oh, many of my best friends went to Meredith.  I know what a woman&#8217;s college can do.  Where did you go to school?  LL:  I went to Wake Forest.  SB:  Okay.  And I think it&#8217;s fine.  I think co-ed education is fine too.  I thoroughly enjoyed my years at State and Carolina.  But there was something about that time of your life to have a sisterhood and to be able to speak out in class and not worry about the boy next door who might be wanting to flirt with you.  That sort of thing.  So that really didn&#8217;t surprise me because while I was at Peace, in 1996 I guess it was, the president there, Garrett Briggs, called a committee together to talk.  And of course [he] involved the trustees, too, about the fact that we were having some enrollment problems, and they had a study done and the report was that a two-year woman&#8217;s Christian-related college was [a] dying species.  We&#8217;d have to change some things.  We thought about going co-ed and decided no.  We&#8217;d go four-year instead.  And we worked really hard for a couple of years on that, really hard, which sort of amuses me because this woman has come in now and taken over Peace and turned it to WPU&#8212;did they ever say those initials aloud before they decided that would be the name of the college?  [She] has done all of this with the wave of her hand.  I wrote a letter to the trustees and I said what I said to you about becoming co-ed.  I knew that might be a possibility and it didn&#8217;t worry me that much.  But for you to go in and just tap the college on the head and say, &#8220;Behold, you&#8217;re a university.&#8221;  LL:  It&#8217;s a process.  SB:  Without a graduate course.  Not one.  And with no real schools, nothing that&#8217;s a university.  So that irritates me beyond words.  I spent more time with that than I would like to.  There are, I will tell you, the alumnae of that college are a fierce bunch.   LL:  I bet.  SB:  I do not want them against me, I&#8217;ll tell you.  They are fighting like fury to get rid of her.  Anyhow at Peace yes, we saw more interest, more emphasis on careers.  We hired for the first time a career advisor and we hired a counselor, about the same time, well, a little earlier than that.  We&#8217;d had a president who did not believe in counselors.  He had gotten his master&#8217;s in counseling, but he did not believe in counseling.  That&#8217;s not Garrett Briggs.  He was glad to have counselors there, and I was certainly glad to [be able to] walk the girls down to the counselor&#8217;s office because I knew I was not, as an English professor, prepared to help them with the problems they had.  We had had a business department, but they taught stenography.  LL:  Oh my.  SB:  Yes, oh my.  And the people in that department had to work harder than anybody else because they had to learn all about computers and computing after we finally got some.  That former president, I think he thought that computers were a fad and if he just paid no attention to them they&#8217;d go away.  But then the next president immediately got a bunch of computers in and now everybody has their computers and everything has changed.  But yeah, there was a lot more emphasis on the woman as a career woman and not just, &#8220;Go to Carolina and find a husband,&#8221; which was the usual route.  Go to Carolina and [if you] couldn&#8217;t go to Carolina you went to State and you found a husband.  But [then] they started internships.  I was the one who was asked, when we went four year we knew that a lot of our students wanted to be teachers, and we didn&#8217;t think we could afford an education department because they&#8217;re very expensive.  So we arranged with Meredith that [the students] would get their major at Peace and would go to Meredith for the education courses, including their practice teaching, which was a beautiful set-up.  It was good for everybody.  It worked really well.  So some of those students wanted to be interns even before they did practice teaching, which I thought was wonderful.  I oversaw some internships.    LL: And what year did Peace go four year?    SB:  1998.  That was the first graduating class.    LL:  So I&#8217;m wondering if, I hope this isn&#8217;t jumping too much, but I know that you&#8217;re an active member at Pullen, yeah, Pullen Baptist?  SB:  Mm-hmm.  LL:  Pullen Memorial Baptist.  I&#8217;m wondering if you can say, from what little I know about it, it strikes me as this wonderful progressive church, and I&#8217;m just wondering if you could just say a little bit about what you do at Pullen and what it means to you?  SB:  You&#8217;re right.  It&#8217;s wonderful, wonderful and it&#8217;s progressive.  We were dyed-in-the-wool Methodists.  Both of us came from Methodist families.  Bob&#8217;s father had been the dean at Brevard College, which was a Methodist college.  I had written Methodist materials, Sunday school, youth work materials and things like that.  He had worked in a Methodist church before and so forth and so on.  But we were in a very conservative Methodist church.  We made the mistake of joining because we liked the preacher.  And of course the preacher stays four years and is gone.  Well, Suzanne Newton is a well-known writer around here.  We were good friends.  And she had asked me to come [to Pullen] and help them to do a workshop in which members would turn out poems for an advent booklet and I did that.  And then on the Sunday they would be given out, my friend who taught with me at Peace and went to Pullen said, &#8220;They&#8217;re going to give out the booklets, why don&#8217;t you come with us?&#8221;  And we did and the very first, this is the first time we ever knocked on the doors of Pullen, there were the minister and the assistant minister and when it came time for the sermon, they came and sat down in chairs in front of the altar and had a dialogue sermon about their differing concepts of Jesus.  I thought, &#8220;This is for me.&#8221;  When you&#8217;ve got that sort of freedom and&#8212;  LL:  To talk about that.  SB:  That sort of exploration, and we didn&#8217;t join right away because we had a wonderful Sunday school class in that very conservative&#8212;heretic&#8217;s class&#8212;and we would talk about the social issues of the day and everything else, and so we&#8217;d go to it and run over there for the service.  And then one time when we were listening to the service and Bill Finlator made the invitation, and our son who was at the time ten&#8212;the one who is getting married there [indicates photo]&#8212;said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go?&#8221;  We looked at each other and said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we?&#8221;  We joined two weeks later.  It is just one of the most glorious things in my life because it allows a lot of freedom in theology.  We don&#8217;t have anyone who is a real fundamentalist, but we have some people who are very traditional.  They would believe in the virgin birth, the bodily resurrection of Christ and things like that.  There are others who are, well, I call myself a Christian agnostic.  I believe a lot of stuff, but I can&#8217;t say for sure [to] any of it.  I just don&#8217;t know what it is.  The people there are all so active in good causes in various ways.  They&#8217;re all so principled.  The peace and justice committee tries to spend its small amount of money on everything from sending a contribution to the Human Rights Society of North Carolina to sending some to Kiva.  Are you familiar with Kiva?  LL:  Uh-huh.  Micro-lending, micro&#8212;  SB:  Micromanagement, micro&#8212;  LL:  Loans or something.  SB:  Microloans.  Yeah.  LL:  And social entrepreneurship.    SB:  In fact I thought of just doing one on my own just because we still, they pay back and reinvest and do that.  To sponsoring forums on such things as the Israeli problem.  Peace, race, still problems of race, of course the big thing that Pullen came out in, I guess [the last] twelve years, has been the gay/lesbian [issue], and that&#8217;s why we got kicked out of the Southern Baptist church.  They saved us the trouble of resigning but&#8212;.  LL:  I was going to ask when, I&#8217;m sure they must have broken with the Southern Baptist Convention at some point, but it was back twelve years ago?  SB:  Well, the North Carolina convention was very unhappy with us even before [Bob and I] joined [Pullen] because we became one of twelve, I think, Baptist churches in the state that did not require you to get rebaptized.  I know I asked Bill Finlator, &#8220;Do we get dunked again?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;No, that won&#8217;t be a problem.&#8221;  And then it was one of the first to ordain [women] ministers, just have the ceremony of ordination, and then we had an associate pastor, Nancy Petty, who is now a full pastor.  She was the associate pastor of the church.  We were one of the first to have a woman pastor.  Now that was twenty years ago.  She just celebrated her twentieth anniversary.  Since then a lot of churches of all denominations have women [pastors].  But when Jack McKinney was called to be our minister to replace Mahan Siler after he&#8217;d been there a year, he called the deacons together and he said, &#8220;You know Nancy and I do very much the same things and she&#8217;s just as good at it as I am.  We should be co-pastors.  And you can take our two salaries and put them together and split them,&#8221; which was a tremendous gift from him.  Of course he was making considerably more then she was.  I said I never knew what democracy was until I joined Pullen.  Every major decision we make we have meeting after meeting after meeting.  We have them in houses, we have them at the church on Wednesday nights, which is our Wednesday night fellowship, we have them on Sunday afternoons, and usually the election is held on a Sunday afternoon.  And by the time that question is brought up, everyone has had every opportunity, done everything but dragged you to talk about.  So we did that and we said, &#8220;Yes, they can be co-pastors,&#8221; and then&#8212;about four years ago, because it was Jack McKinney&#8217;s last day was the day my husband went into the hospital for the last time&#8212;and [Jack] went to the deacons again and said, &#8220;I have decided that the preaching ministry is not the way I want to spend my career.  I want to be a counselor.&#8221;  So he started a counseling service.  So Nancy has been raised.  It wasn&#8217;t a done deal.  It wasn&#8217;t just assumed that she would be the pastor, but we went through another set of discussions and she was selected.  But the people who voted for Amendment One, I just wish they could be members of Pullen, or be at Pullen for six months and see the wonderful gays and lesbians we have there.  Some of them&#8212; I say if they leave, the pillars are not going to shake; they&#8217;re going to crumble.  Because some of them do just work and work and work at the church.  They&#8217;re wonderful people.    LL:  I was going to ask you with, I&#8217;m thinking to the ERA for instance, how do you deal with people who are Christians as well who are on the other side of some of these social issues and using Christianity as an argument?  SB:  Well, carefully.  I told you I don&#8217;t like in-your-face.  I don&#8217;t think in-your-face gets you anywhere.  I think if you came in and said, &#8220;I really hate lesbians,&#8221;  I wouldn&#8217;t just bang you over the head with it.  I would probably tell you about my experience with some and how dear I found some of them to be and how deeply Christian some of them are, probably more so than I am.  I guess I don&#8217;t know whether I&#8217;m a coward or whether I really just believe you attract more bees with honey than you do with vinegar.  LL:  Yeah.  SB:  That&#8217;s usually the way I do it, and I don&#8217;t deliberately knock someone.  If I know someone who is really avidly against something I just won&#8217;t bring it up.  But if they bring it up, I&#8217;ll respond.    LL:  You&#8217;ve lived in the South all your life, right?  How has being southern influenced your concern for social justice, and do you feel as though it&#8217;s limited them in any way?  SB:  It may have limited some of my activism, being as energetically activist as I'd like because race was such a hard thing when I was a girl.  You know whenever I see a black postman, a black policeman, a black businessman I think golly, this has all happened in my lifetime.  It&#8217;s just amazing to me and wonderful.  And I've worked with black people on some committees, like we had a women writers&#8217; conference&#8212;Emily Wilson, that&#8217;s her baby.  And I was co-chairman with a black woman to pick out writers to invite.  Well, I guess I don&#8217;t know whether this is my nature or whether this is the southern business, and of course when you&#8217;ve lived in the South your whole life you can&#8217;t quite tear the two things apart. But the southern woman is supposed to be a gracious lady.  And so I&#8217;m sure that has had an effect.  It kept me from being as peppery as I might have been otherwise.  Walking the line between cowardice and sensibility is sometimes&#8212;  LL:  It&#8217;s difficult.  SB:  Sometimes it&#8217;s difficult, yeah.  I will say that as I've lived longer and seen what&#8217;s gone on longer, I&#8217;m no longer embarrassed to be a Southerner because a lot of the North has a lot to be embarrassed about, too.  I mean I didn&#8217;t elect Michelle Bachmann to the Congress.  But then I didn&#8217;t elect Jesse Helms either.  I used to have a bumper sticker that said &#8220;I&#8217;m from North Carolina and I did not vote for Jesse Helms.&#8221;  LL:  Nice.  SB:  And I kept it on the car until the car was crashed.    LL:  Good for you.  Well, is there anything else that you&#8217;d like to add or anything I didn&#8217;t ask about that you want to talk about?  SB:  Lordy.  Let me see my notes.  [pause&#8212;looking through notes]  I feel like I&#8217;ve been very lucky along the way to have mentors.  My mother was the first one.  There was one minister that was at my church when I was a child&#8212;I cannot quote anything he ever said or anything, but I think he was a model for justice.  Warren Ashby and Bill Mueller, both of whom were very strong voices for justice.  Sam Ragan, Guy Owen.  Who is the one that came to me before I said Sam Ragan?  I can&#8217;t think who it is.  Anyhow, I've had, and well, Barbara Berkeley. There has always been someone along the way who stood for, I've gotten so I call, I use the word &#8220;decent&#8221; a lot.  I think the word decent has been underused.  If you&#8217;re decent, you are just.  And if you are decent, you are kind, and you try to put yourself in the other person&#8217;s shoes.  I've had a lot of mentors that have showed me that.  My husband was one who was very kind and gentle and a good man.  And when he became fired up about the Israeli, I've never seen him become so fired up and so vocal, and he would do that and then with our friends or with [phone ringing]&#8212;just let it run&#8212;or with my friends or with my family I just couldn&#8217;t believe it.  It was wonderful to see him get that fired up.  LL:  So you think that decency is sort at the core of the many different activist campaigns you&#8217;ve been a part of?  SB:  Decency and humility are two of the most important words that we don&#8217;t say enough.  We talk about [phone, pause]&#8212;  Oh, I know who that is.  I&#8217;ll call her in a little bit.  She&#8217;s wanting to have supper tonight.  She&#8217;s another good liberal.  I have to tell you that one of her, one of the people that she had met just recently said, &#8220;You know we haven&#8217;t talked about politics.  I hope you&#8217;re conservative.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Oh no.  My God. I&#8217;m a flaming liberal.&#8221;  So they decided they would not talk about politics.  Yeah, she&#8217;s another&#8212;and all my friends.  I really do not ask people their political inclinations when I meet them.  But I&#8217;m not as good a preacher for the social justice as I could be if I had some Republican friends, but I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ve had one Republican friend, one.  And I don&#8217;t see her but about once every five years.  My high school friends, our high school class is most unusual.  We met for our fiftieth anniversary and had such a great time that from then on we&#8217;ve had one every year.  And with no big program, just go and eat and enjoy each other.  And it was easy to see which ones, and so we&#8217;ve become great email friends again.  LL:  Great.  If there&#8217;s anything else you want to add or&#8212;  SB:  Hmm.  I&#8217;m glad Obama&#8217;s president although he&#8217;s disappointed me in some ways.  He&#8217;s disappointed me mainly, a lot of people have been disappointed that he has not cured the economy well.  Well, that&#8217;s too complicated for me.  One man could not do, especially since Europe is in such a mess.  They&#8217;re dragging us down now.  I&#8217;m disappointed in him for not doing more to stop any sort of rendition or sending&#8212;.  That&#8217;s another one of the things we worked on at our church was opposing rendition.  I&#8217;m not sure why he hasn&#8217;t, as he said he would do, gotten rid of Guantanamo, but I think it&#8217;s partly because [of the] opposition in this country to bringing any prisoners into this country.  That may be it.   I&#8217;m also not sure why he&#8217;s in Afghanistan but I really think it&#8217;s because of Pakistan.  Pakistan has the nuclear bomb, and it has a liquid border that the Taliban and al Qaeda or whoever can go back and forwards.  And I think he&#8217;s trying very hard to get Afghanistan on its feet which I&#8217;m afraid is&#8212;  LL:  A losing battle.  SB:  A losing battle.  Yeah.  A few things, and he signed this, I can&#8217;t think of the name of it but it&#8217;s sort of like the Patriot Act that someone could pick you up and put you in jail without any charges.  I do not understand that at all.  So I've written him some letters.  And I put some of them in all caps or in all red print, put it on facts and color.    LL:  So you&#8217;re very much engaged and active.    SB:  I still try to.  LL:  Great, it&#8217;s been so great to talk to you.  SB:  Well, you are a wonderful interviewer.  LL:  Thank you very much.  SB:  You make me comfortable.  I appreciate that.  LL:  Well, I&#8217;ll go ahead and turn this off.  SB:  All right.
