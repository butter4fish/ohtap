 Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  Today is October 20, 2007. We   re in the Conoco Phillips Alumni Center  on the OSU campus. My name is Tanya Finchum and this part of the  Oklahoma State University Library   s project entitled O-STATE Stories,  where we   re collecting interviews with alumni from OSU   OAMC. I   m  here with Butch and Carolyn Savage and they   re from the class of    53.  So thank you for taking time out to interview with us today. Let   s start  by having you tell a little bit about where you   re from, where you grew  up.  I grew up in Oklahoma City and went all of my school years, previous to  college, there. I graduated from Northeast High School and then I came  to OSU as a freshman in 1949. I was among the first who lived in Stout  Hall   it was brand new. I lived in the second floor corner room and it  was a wonderful experience. I lived there my freshman year and then the  next three years I lived at the Kappa Alpha Theta house. I was active on  campus doing things with the sorority and with the Women   s Athletic  Association.  Were you the first in your family to come to OSU?  Yes, I was. All my cousins were OU  University of Oklahoma   graduates and my daddy said he would rather have me come here  because it wasn   t the party school that OU was. He just thought it   d be a  better atmosphere here.  And do you have siblings?  No   only child.  And what about you Mr. Savage?  5  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  Well, I was born in Kansas and my parents moved to Oklahoma when I  was five. We were located in Osage County up around Pawhuska,  Oklahoma. We lived in the country on a ranch and I went to Pawhuska  School with the exception of my senior year in high school when we  moved to Hominy, Oklahoma. And outside of Hominy is where Carolyn  and I have lived the rest of our lives up, until the last few years,  ranching.  How did you come to choose OSU?  Well, you know that   s a good question. I think it was probably because I  had a few friends that were attending here, more than likely. And also I  wanted to be involved in agriculture.  How far from Hominy is it to here?  Oh, it   s just about seventy miles.  In those days it took a little longer to get here?  Well especially if you didn   t have a car, and I didn   t.  So how would you get here?  Well we had two methods of transportation back then. Either the bus or  hitchhiking, and hitchhiking was quite common. On Friday evenings  every highway leading out of Stillwater would be lined with students  hitchhiking home and people would always stop and pick you up. We  wouldn   t (Laughs) see that today would we?  No, we wouldn   t.  But it was very common back then. I could generally get home in a  couple of hours   three hours hitchhiking.  And what about you, how did you get from Oklahoma City?  Well, I had a car (Laughs).  That was the reason I dated her.  (Laughter) There were very few cars then. A few people had them, but  most didn   t.  I   d say most women didn   t for sure.  6  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  No, no they didn   t.  And now I think every student has four cars. (Laughter)  It sure seems that way.  Boy, it does.  So how did you two meet once you got here?  We had a blind date. Some friends got us together that were dating and  we had a blind date and that was pretty much it. We didn   t date many  other people until then or after then.  What would you do for a date? What type of activities   would you walk  to the movie?  Yes. Well, we took my car if we went to a movie. We went to the  Leachman Theatre down on Main Street. I think it   s a furniture store or  something now.  It is.  And on Sunday, we would usually go to the show and then we   d eat at  Swim   s? Was it Swim   s?  Yes, I think so.  I think it was Swim   s. It was not very far from the movie, and usually  had     I remember, seventy-five cents for it     Yes, for a hamburger steak, you know. No one had much money, really.  He was a Sigma Chi and so we would go to all their parties and the  Theta   s would have parties. We had lots of dances up on the Starlight  Terrace at the Student Union which was   I guess that   s all enclosed  now, but it was open then.  Did you have bands come in or music from what?  Well, some local musicians would play, and     Yes, yes.  Really?  7  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  Yes.  Yes, there were good bands at OSU. The people that were in the  Orchestra and the     Yes, they had a dance band, the University Dance Band.  What if you didn   t know how to dance?  Well, you learned (Laughter).  You didn   t just sit and watch?  No. That was when the bunny hop was prevalent. I remember one time  we were upstairs at the Starlight Terrace and we were hopping and I  kicked my foot and it  shoe  went off the balcony of the Starlight  Terrace, clear down.  What, your foot or the shoe?  Well, my shoe. (Laughter) I think my shoe  We lost my shoe and I had  to go get it. And he likes to fish and sometimes we   d go fishing. Then as  we dated more, sometimes I went home with him, met his folks. I had  never even been on a farm much less a ranch. I didn   t know anything  about ranching or farming. That was the last thing I ever thought I would  do.  City girl meets country boy.  Yes, yes.  And so, did you get pinned while you     Yes.  Did you get thrown in Theta Pond then?  You know, I did (Laughs). I think there   s still an imprint of my body.  (Laughter)  Well, what was that like?  Well, it was cold, it was cold. But yes, that was a common. Does that  custom still prevail?  Not that I   m aware of.  8  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Well, then how   d you know about it?  Other people have mentioned that they had seen their friends get thrown  in and so I was curious.  Well   yes, I participated in that activity.  And you know when I was a freshman, for many years, the girls had to  be in the dorms by eight o   clock.  Had a curfew.  Uh-huh, had a curfew and then I think on weekends we could stay out  until midnight. Then when I moved to the Theta house, Francis Briggs  was our housemother and she would start flipping the switch when it  was time to come in. One thing that   s interesting is that Boone Pickens  was the Theta houseboy and worked in the kitchen.  Actually worked in the kitchen?  Yes, he did. Like everybody else, he didn   t have much money and the  house boys could eat at the sorority houses. And I understand they don   t  do this anymore. We had three meals a day and were served. On  Sunday   I think Sunday evening they did not have a meal, but all the  rest of the time, the meals were in the house. That   s just not the way they  do it now.  Were they included in your price of tuition then?  Yes, well included in your house bill. And he  Butch  was the steward  for the Sigma Chi House. He planned the meals and     It   s when I learned to make gravy. (Laughter)  So you still do that, huh?  You bet.  (Laughs) Well for finances then, how did you pay your way through at  that time? Did you have a scholarship or     No.     worked your way through or what?  I worked for my room and board through the kitchen   received my  9  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  room and board there. Mayflower Moving Company, the big moving  vans that move people, you know? They had an office here in Stillwater  and I worked for them loading furniture when they had a client to move,  which was almost every week, at least one or two jobs. And we   d do it  in the evenings or on the weekends, load those trucks. Then I collected  laundry. I worked for a laundry, collecting the laundry and collected the  payments and delivered the laundry. My last two years, in ROTC   Reserve Officers Training Corps  we were paid  30 a month. Those  three sources of revenue met all of our needs. It didn   t take much money  back then.  It   s a lot different than our grandchildren, who are in school today.  Are they going here, your grandchildren?  I have one   the rest of them, three of them were at Texas A M. But  we have a grandson whose here on campus now.  Great, and did any children come here then?  Both our daughter and son came here. We took them around to visit  other colleges, but Butch told them,    Well you can go visit all those  other colleges you want to, but if you want to have your way paid,  you   re going to go to (Laughs) Oklahoma       It was Oklahoma State by  then, and they came here and they loved it.  Sure.  And they had a good time, and it was good for them.  So, you graduated before they changed the name?  Yes.  Yes.  What did you think about the name change?  Well, I think it   s appropriate. It   s a little added sophistication.  I didn   t like it. I wished it had stayed OAMC, I loved that. In fact, I  have my   the tag on my car is OAMC and so many people don   t know  what it means.  Right.  10  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  It will be fewer and fewer every year. (Laughs)  Every year, right  I just love OAMC and I realize it   s a big state  university now but I have great fondness for the name.  What's your favorite place on campus?  I guess Theta Pond. I loved to walk around it and be there.  Football Stadium, (Laughs) particularly when we win.  Particularly, yes. And did you go to many sporting events when you  were students?  Oh yes, we went to all of them.  Well for your years, I   ve heard someone mention that they had to do the  odds and evens?  Yes.  Did you have that for tickets? There weren   t enough for everybody to  have one so they had to do odds and evens?  Did they?  Yes, they did. But often you were able to get somebody   s ticket.  Yes, we never had a problem going to a game.  You never had a problem, because not everybody was interested in  going, and those     Well we didn   t win many football games     No, we didn   t.      so you could always get in the stadium. Basketball was where the  tickets were harder to get.  I think that   s probably what they were talking about.  Yes, but you could always wiggle a ticket out of somewhere.  Well, what was your major?  11  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Education.  And what about yours?  Animal husbandry.  And what have you done since    with those degrees?  Well, I ranched all my life.  Okay, and did you teach?  Well, I substituted when he was in the service. He was in the service in  Aniston, Alabama in the Chemical Core. So while he was there, I did  substitute and I had a contract to teach the coming year. Then I got  pregnant and I was real sick   nauseated the whole time and I just  couldn   t function. So I substituted all the time. My children were in  school and Butch, of course, didn   t want me to teach full-time, so I was  able to stay home with the children. But I have substituted a lot and I  enjoy that, because it was in Hominy, you know, a small town and you  knew all the kids. It was nice.  And how often do you get back to campus?  Quite often. We come to all sporting events and, well, in years past we  used to spend a lot of time up here and she was involved. She was on the  Board of Regents forever and ever   16 years.  Yes, that   s a long time.  And so that brought her to the campus all the time and I was fortunate  enough to be invited and included in some of the activities.  Well with sporting events, all of them or just football and basketball?  Generally football and basketball, yes.  Wrestling?  Yes.  We went to some wrestling matches when you were in school.  Oh yes, yes.  But we haven   t been to many since then. Your life just gets so    you  12  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  can   t come to everything, you know.  When you set foot on campus do you get a particular fuzzy feeling or  something?  Oh, this campus means a lot to us because our children went here and  then I went on the Board  of Regents  in 1977, the same year Dr. Larry  Boger became president. We came on at the same time. So I was here  all the time that he was president and I just saw so many buildings go up  and he did such a good job as president. We had a lot of fun memories of  that. One year the Coca-Cola people invited Oklahoma State and Texas  Tech to go to Japan, to play in the Japan Bowl. So both teams went and  both members of each Board of Regents, the Texas Tech and us, we got  to go. We got to go over there and spend several days and see Japan. We  stayed in Tokyo and that was a wonderful experience.  Sure.  It   s just so many things like that, that we got to do that we wouldn   t have  gotten to do otherwise. Having seen buildings go up and seeing the way  the school has progressed and the faculty members   you get to know  them. Often, many of the ones that I knew are no longer here, except for  Dr. Carl Reed, I think he   s still the Dean of Engineering. We knew him,  and it   s just a wonderful experience.  1953 was about the time the library opened, the new library or the  current library, wasn   t here at that time?  It was later than that.  No it was a little later.  A little later, we     The Union was just completed in    53.  It was the     Okay.  Yes, the Student Union.  But the Library, it was a wooden building.  It was in, it was you know where your Chemistry Department     13  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  I spent a lot of time there, she didn   t, but    (Laughter)  Where you told me you went to the Chemistry lab, well the old Library  was close by there, too.  But it was a wooden structure.  No it wasn   t, it was brick.  No, it wasn   t.  But I did a lot of studying at the library. I loved to study at the library.  And I   ve been on the Friends of the Library board since I graduated,  with Dr. Johnson. You probably didn   t know Ed Johnson? Did you?  He was a very nice man, yes.  And so I have great fondness for the library. I think that is the heart of  the campus, the library. And our daughter-in-law is a librarian. She   s a  school librarian in Southlake, Texas in one of their schools. It   s just a  wonderful thing that librarians do. I really appreciate it because I know  how much time she spends at it, it   s ongoing.  The information highway   s quite large now.  Yes, it is. Yes, it is.  Since the Union was just started, what type of activities did you  participate in there? We   ve heard people mention bridge games.  Oh well, we didn   t.  I didn   t know how to play bridge until I     He didn   t until we played in        in fact I still don   t.  Oh, yes you do. But most of the bridge I learned to play was at the  sorority house. It was up on the fourth floor and it was an ongoing  bridge game. There were people that I knew that had time between  classes you know or something. It seems like I was always in class, but  if you had a lot of extra time you could come and play a bridge game  between classes.  And which dorm did you live in?  14  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  Stout Hall.  And what about you?  I lived in the Sigma Chi House.  Not the dorm anytime?  No.  What was graduation day like? Did they have an official commencement  like they do now?  Oh yes, it was at the football stadium.  Outside?  Uh-huh, and everybody   I think there were 15,000 people here when  we were on campus. It wasn   t that large of a school and you could get  everybody in there. It was a smaller stadium, certainly, than we have  now.  It was the Aggies then?  Yes.  So what was the mascot then? Was it Pistol Pete at that time?  Oh, yes.  Was it? Okay.  But not as prominent as he is now. I don   t think, not as prominent. Dr.  Willham, I think, was the president when we graduated and Dr. Bennett  had been killed in a plane crash. And a lot of our   one of Butch   s best  friends, he was with his family over in Ethiopia because OSU sponsored  the Point Four Program that went to underdeveloped countries to help  them. Dr. Brannon was over there for years, which his good friend  Russell was as a child growing up over there with him. He ended up at  the University of Kentucky     How did you get on that?  I don   t know. (Laughter)  Well I want to go back just a minute to the Theta Pond thing. Once you  15  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  got thrown in, then what, you had to walk back to your dorm in the cold,  soaking wet?  Soaking wet, yes.  Soaking wet.  Yes.  Did you know you were going to get thrown in?  Well, yes.  So could you plan ahead of time?  But you don   t know when. Once you   re pinned, I think you   re thrown in  but you don   t have any idea when the brothers will get together and do  it.  So your wallet, and your shoes and everything goes with you?  That   s right, that   s right. Yes, that was a common occurrence back then.  You could always see a whole bunch of boys, and they   d have one  individual and they were holding him (Laughs) headed for Theta Pond  and (Whistles) there he   d go. I was always afraid that somebody would  get hurt.  Did they try to do it more than once? How did they keep track of how  many times you   d done it?  No, once is adequate.  You can just say,    I   ve done it   ?  Yes, you   re baptized.  Unless you got pinned to someone else another time and then you   d  probably be thrown in again.  Yes.  Did they throw professors in too, if they happened to get engaged or  something?  Oh, I don   t know.  16  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  No, I don   t think so, just students.  Just students.  Yes.  Did you have a favorite professor?  You know, I did, yes.  And who would that be?  Well, it was a gentleman named Bob Noble who was in the School of  Agriculture and just an outstanding teacher and counselor and I thought  a lot of him.  And what about you?  I don   t guess I really did. It seems like in the School of Education they  are always switching you know. I   ll tell who I did get close to and that  was Dean Patchin. She was the Dean of Women and I served on some  counsel that she kind of led. I kept in touch with her throughout the  years and Velma Patchin   I just loved her to death. I also knew Valerie  Colvin. I was on a committee that worked with her and that   s who  Colvin Center   s named after. So I enjoyed both of those relationships. I  think I became more deeply involved with them than I actually did with  any of my professors.  So how often during the school year would you go home? It   s probably  different for both of you.  As a freshman I think I went home a lot because I was homesick, but  after that, I just stayed here.  I didn   t really go home that much.  You   d go home to work cattle.  Probably, because of the transportation situation.  You didn   t want to hitchhike any more than you had to.  Yes. I had this cardboard suitcase and I   d put my clothes in it and  hitchhike home.  And you used to have that horrible green wool jacket.  17  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Why is that important? (Laughter)  He had tied the lid up. (Laughs)  Oh we   ve heard stories     Are we about through? (Laughs)  No we   re just getting started, unless you want to be through.  (Laughs) He   s teasing you, teasing you.  Well a lot people just came with one or two blankets, too, we   ve been  told. It   s interesting to hear what people came with. And one suitcase is  what most of them had. Just the times were different.  They really were.  I should say so.  Did you have siblings?  I have one brother.  And did he go here?  No, he went to Kansas State.  Older or younger?  He   s older.  So you didn   t follow after him?  No, I didn   t.  He was a veterinarian and they didn   t have a vet school here at the time.  And had your parents gone to college or were you the first in your  family?  Yes.  Same for you?  Uh-huh.  18  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Now you have three generations though since you   ve got grandchildren  down here too?  Sure do.  So both of you must have a lot of orange in your closets?  I do  (Laughs) And his grandchildren keep giving him all this orange  and he doesn   t wear it a whole lot. But he   s started to this year. You   ve  worn more orange this year.  I don   t want to be conspicuous (Laughs).  When you were attending here it probably wasn   t a big deal to wear  orange.  Oh no, it wasn   t. No, you could wear anything, it didn   t matter.  And you didn   t wear     Mostly just had one shirt anyway.  Yes, we adorned mostly skirts and saddle oxfords and bobby socks and  sweaters, you know. I don   t think I even owned a pair of Levi   s, or  jeans. I can say this, the students back then dressed better than they do  today.  With less.  Yes  They were neater. Well of course it was almost everybody dressed, all  the girls dressed alike. They   d have the shirts and they had the little ties,  they   d put them in here, and it was   everybody looked alike, the girls.  (Laughs)  And for the dances you had to have formal dresses?  Yes, well some dances. And then you had dance hour every week at  your house and you wouldn   t wear formals to that, but you   d wear a  dress or a skirt, or something.  What was Homecoming like back then?  Oh, it was fun. I think one thing about it, I think they   ve preserved  Homecoming more than anything I know of. I can remember us     19  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  Basically it   s the same.  Yes.  The house decorations and parade.  Probably, the house decorations are more elaborate     Oh, yes.     but everybody stuffed those poms in the things and you worked all  night for several days before. I remember one of the last times I helped,  it just rained and rained. It got our float wet and everything dripped. It  was terrible, because that crepe paper gets on your clothing and you  can   t get it out.  Well, the dye would.  Yes, the dye.  You didn   t skip classes to do the work though, did you?  No.  No, never.  So it wasn   t like they do now     No. We did all the work at night.  Had more floats then than they do now, didn   t they?  Yes, they had a lot of floats, everybody had a float. And it was fun.  Did they do the Walk Around then or is that a more recent   ?  Well, I can   t remember that there was a certain   like on Friday night, I  can   t remember that there was that. But people would, people would  drive in their cars and want to see all the different places that had the  decorations.  Were the floats hidden until the day of the parade?  Yes.  Tried to be?  20  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  C. Savage  Yes, you had a garage somewhere or if someone had at an auto  dealership or a big barn or something.  How much money was spent on something like that then, cause it would  have to come out of your pockets, wouldn   t it?  I think it was in a budget that you had, that the entity had and then they  covered that figure in their budget for the year.  Okay.  I remember one     I don   t think there was much money to spend. They weren   t nearly as  elaborate as they are now.  Didn   t spend a lot?  A little lumber, some chicken wire, and some crepe paper, you know.  And a good engineer to come up with the design.  When was it you all, the Sigma Chi   s did the,    It   s not how you win or  lose, it   s how you play the game,    and they had these   they had they put  these guys in        statues.     statues and they taped them somehow and they cut it off, and they  sprayed them gold. And they really looked like statues, you know doing  different things. I think you, didn   t you win first place with that?  Oh more than likely. (Laughs) I don   t remember.     It   s not whether you win or lose it   s how you play the game.     By Grantland Rice, isn   t that right?  Yes.  Isn   t that what he said?  It   s an old Chinese proverb.  It was Sigma Chi   they put it on their sidewalk, out going to the street  and there were about five or six of these big, life-size gold statues. It was  21  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  really pretty.  I   ll have to find some pictures. Did you take some?  I don   t think we have any.  I   ll have to look in the library, see if we can find some.  Yes, I just don   t remember if we have any, I know we don   t. But so  those things you kind of remember because they   re so unusual.  Do you have a favorite story about your time here? Besides getting  thrown in the pond?  Favorite story     Yes.  Well, I think I always enjoyed when the fraternities would come and  serenade the sororities when someone got pinned. I loved that because  they all had good voices and they really could sing well. I don   t know  whether they still do that or not.  I don   t know. No one else has said that in our discussions. They might  not.  But they, when you got pinned they would come and serenade.  Do you stay in touch with many of your friends from that time period?  I stay in touch with a couple, with some in my pledge class. We e-mail,  you know we just started doing that, and that   s fun. I do the e-mailing,  and he doesn   t do any, but I do stay in touch with some of his Sigma Chi  friends by e-mail.  Well, I think that   s one of the great assets of a college education is the  life-long friends you make.  It   s kind of hard to maintain though, when they get scattered about the  country.  It is. It is and it   s a shame that you don   t do more but both of us have  relationships that are priceless.  And we   re getting to the age now where you   re losing some friends to  death and that   s hard.  22  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  B. Savage  Finchum  B.

And were there many people?  Oh yes, we did because I was on the board then, yes.  No, no she   s talking about our wedding anniversary.  No, no graduation, I   m sorry, graduation anniversary. Have you  reached the other one yet?  Yes, oh yes we did.  Yes, oh yes a few years ago.  But class reunion, 50 year class reunion.  In fact they gave us all a cap with OAMC, and you   d be amazed when  you wear it on the campus people would say,    What does that mean?     Yes, that was in School of Agriculture.  Yes.     and they gave you a pin or something.  What's been the biggest change from the way the campus looks until  now? The stadium looks bigger, I   m sure.  Just the size of it and the student body.  And the number of cars.  Yes, you   d never find a parking place.  Something needs to be done about that. (Laughs)  They   re building parking garages, if you can count that.  I think the students as a whole, they   re more sophisticated now. Of  course, they   ve had the benefit of all this new world of technology and  they just are     23  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  B. Savage  Well, a lot of them come with ten or twelve or fifteen hours of college  credits they   ve already received in high school. It   s just unbelievable.  We certainly didn   t have that situation when we were in school. The  students are really bright today. I   m amazed with our grandchildren how  committed they are to their religion, ours are anyway. They   re deeply  involved in their church and they go. We always went to church when  we were here, but I   m just surprised they   re interested in Bible groups  and things like that which we did not do. People just didn   t do that. We  just went to church on Sunday.  Where here in town would you go?  We went to the Methodist Church with Ferrin Stowe. He became a  bishop in the Methodist Church, eventually. He married us in Oklahoma  City at St. Luke   s Methodist. He was wonderful.  Sixth and Duck?  Yes.  That Methodist one, it   s that one?  Yes, it   s bigger now. You know it used just to be one building. We  noticed today that the Presbyterians are adding on a new fellowship  building to their building. I   m sure probably all of the churches have  grown. I guess it   s amazing how much Stillwater as a whole has grown.  All these huge homes west of town. The world has changed. Sometimes  I think our grandchildren have a lot more things than we ever had  growing up, but they handle it pretty well.  They came from good stock.  Well, we hope.  What else would you like to cover today? If you were giving advice to  students, what would you tell them about coming here?  Study hard. Make the best of it.  Yes, I think they come, a lot of students come expecting to have a good  time, which they have and they forget why they   re here. To really learn,  to become really knowledgeable of their field because they don   t realize  how competitive the world is out there now.  I just don   t think they realize how important it is for them to have a  24  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  C. Savage  successful collegiate career. Once they get into the business world, it   s  going to enhance that opportunity so much more.  More and more people are graduating from here, so its spreading out  too.  We   re amazed. Our children live in the Fort Worth area and we   re  amazed at the volume of Texans that come to OSU from that Fort  Worth, Dallas area. There   s a lot of kids that come up here from down  there.  That   s pretty much a three and a half hour drive, four and a half?  Yes.  And they bypass OU to come up to us?  And of course Texas A M and Texas University, it   s difficult to get in.  You   ve got to be the top 10  of your high school class. So that means  that 90  are going to have to find someplace else to go. As of to date,  Oklahoma State financially is a better deal than so many other major  universities, although it costs a lot to go to college but it costs a lot more  to go a lot of different places than here. That draws students up here,  which I think is great.  Oh, I do to. I think we have wonderful faculty here. I know our children  felt like they had excellent professors and people that cared about them.  They would be invited to their homes and things like that and I think  that   s     A personal touch?     and of course it   s getting so big, I don   t know how much that   s done  today.  They   ve started the Parents Association, so parents can be involved a  little bit more.  I saw a sticker on a car in the parking lot of the Student Union here,     Parents Association,    I   d never seen that before.  Yes, Janet Schmidly started it.  Oh she did?  Oh she's wonderful.  25  B. Savage  Finchum  C. Savage  Finchum  B. Savage  Well, I   ll be darned.  And that   s grown, and keeps growing. Parents are more involved     That   s all I have unless you want to cover something else.  No.  You   ve got time to go somewhere else.  Yep, alrighty.  -------  -------
