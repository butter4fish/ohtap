Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight People magazine-ish type questions that I am compelled to ask you, and they only require a short answer.  And they don't even deserve anything but a short answer.  The first one is: sir, what is your favorite food?

Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Take one day at a time.  Sometimes take a half a day at a time.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Story_ID: 228342
Speaker 1: I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side and your father's [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] side.  But we'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother was Josephine Hughes Hayden.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Mother was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 17th, 1910.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what do you know about her side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that her father, my great-grandfather [sic.], was Joseph Hughes, whose mother was an ex-slave or may have been enslaved.  I'm not sure when he was born.  And his father was the Reverend Cosby [ph.], a Congregational minister in Petersburg, Virginia.
Speaker 1: Wait.  Hold on now.  Now, you say your great-great-grandfather was Joseph (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  My great--my grandfather, my mother's father--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --was Joseph Hughes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, your--
Speaker 2: And she told me that her--his mother, or her grandmother, had been a slave to this Reverend Cosby of the Congregational church in Petersburg.  He was born, I believe, somewhere in the 1860s, early 1870s.  I do know that in 1890, he began working for the Pullman Company, and he was a Pullman porter for fifty years.
Speaker 1: Now, this is Joseph Hughes?
Speaker 2: Joseph Hughes, my grandfather (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --worked for the--as a Pullman porter for fifty years.  And I don't know where he first started riding the rails, whether it was out of New York [New York] or Philly [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] or whatever.  But his work took him to Chicago [Illinois] as a Pullman porter, and that's where he met his wife, my grandmother, Fannie, F-A-N-N-I-E; Wagoner, W-A-G-O-N-E-R.  And they were married in 1902 in Chicago, and they came to Boston [Massachusetts] and purchased a home in the Roxbury section of Boston in the very early 1900s.  So he was working as a Pullman porter and brought his new bride, my grandmother, my mother's mother, to Boston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know what his run was?  He ran from Boston to Chicago or did he go all the way out to the coast or--
Speaker 2: I don't believe he went any further west than Chicago.  Whether he traveled to Philadelphia or point south, I don't know.  But I do remember my mother telling me very distinctly, now.  Here's a man who worked fifty years on the rails as a porter.  And so within the last probably two decades or more of his career, he had the best runs.  He had the best jobs.  He ran on the Merchants Limited [New York, New Haven, and Hartford Railroad].  And the Merchants Limited was the crack train that ran from Boston to New York; Boston to Washington [D.C.]; Boston to Chicago.  So, I do know that he had these runs.  I remember coming to Boston during the summers.  I was probably four, five, six, seven, eight, nine years of age; and every summer we would come to Boston to stay at my grandmother's house.  And I remember we'd come into South Station [Boston, Massachusetts].  And in those days, you know, you had forty, fifty trains coming in, out every day.  But I always remembered standing on the platform once we exited the train, and here was this gentleman in this blue uniform with a blue cap, and he would come down, he would hug us, he would grab our bags, he would push us through South Station.  Marvelous people.  Put us in a taxi, and the taxi would take us to my grandmother's house, and he would disappear.  And I wouldn't see him maybe three or four, five days.  And then all of a sudden, he'd show up at my grandmother's house, his house.  And it was like he was there overnight.  And then the next day he was gone.  And I never thought much about it, except I knew he had worked on the rails.  And nobody told me what he did.  And I didn't know he was a Pullman porter.  I didn't know what kind of work he did.  I was only six, seven, eight, nine or ten; but I remember that he wasn't home a lot during those fifty years.
Story_ID: 228343
Speaker 1: Are there any stories from that [maternal] side of the family about life in the 19th century or--since there are some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I do remember my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] talking a lot about her father, Joseph Hughes.  And she always used to say, "You know, your grandfather had very little education."  She said, "I don't think he had more than a third grade education."  But she said, "He was the most learned man."  She said, "He could talk and hold a conversation with anybody about anything."  And I guess she told me then, but I, of course, learned later that what I call the "Knights of the Rail," the black railroad worker, through their travels, met so many people, went to so many different cities, that they knew what was going on.  So she said he was very well educated because of the kind of work that he did and the kind of people that he had to interact with.  So that's one of the things I remember her saying.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  There are lot of stories about--well, there are some stories about Pullman porters really being educated beyond the job they were doing, you know.
Speaker 2: Oh, as you know, many of them had Ph.D. degrees; dental degrees, law degrees.  But my grandfather, growing up in Petersburg [Virginia], from what she told me, had very little education.  Very little education.
Speaker 1: Now, as I think, there's a book by J.A. Rogers 'From Superman to Man,' about the Pullman porter on a train having conversations--arguing with a southern congressman.  I don't know if you remember that. At any rate, so now, are there any other interesting stories from your mother's side of the family?  What did her mother do?
Speaker 2: One of the things that I remember about my grandmother [Fannie] Hughes, was that my grandparents, the Hugheses, owned a very large home in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], and they had a lot of extra rooms.  And in the '20s [1920s], '30s [1930s] and '40s [1940s], and even beyond--black college students coming to Boston [Massachusetts], had to find their own housing.  So most black college students, at that time, lived in the homes of other black people, either relatives or friends of their parents or people that they knew.  So I remember as a youngster being in my grandmother's house, and there were maybe two or three black women who were going to college in Boston, but who were living and rooming in my grandparents' home.  And so, my grandmother in this sense was a businesswoman.  She was running a boarding house for black college students.  And I remember these young ladies--one in particular, I remember she was studying music--(unclear) conservatory music, her name was Alice [ph.].  And I was four or five, six years old, but she used to help me draw, and she would sing to me.  And that's a great memory from my grandmother's house.  The other thing I remember about my grandparents' house, you know, Pullman porters like my grandfather, were quote kind of middle class.  I remember my grandmother always had the finest of furniture, the finest of silverware; all kinds of accoutrements in the house; beautiful china and things of that nature.  I didn't grow up in a household that had all these beautiful accoutrements: crystals and things of that nature; crystal glassware.  And I recall later in life asking my mother--I was probably a teenager, maybe in my early twenties, you know, "How did grandpa, grandma have such beautiful things?"  She said, those, "A lot of the stuff in that house were tips that he would get from some of the wealthy people that he served on the trains."  And she said, "He served people like the Rockefellers; and the Morgans, the J.P. Morgans; the very wealthy people who rode the trains."  And so she said, "A lot of those things were gifts, and that's how he got paid."
Speaker 1: I always thought that was interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is.  Did he have stories about any of the people he met?
Speaker 1: Well, my grandfather died when I was seven.  The only time I would see him, as I said earlier, were fleeting moments when he happened to be home overnight.  One thing I do remember was sitting on his knee and, I'm not sure how he did it--or I was on his lap, and he was playing his guitar.  And I still have that guitar today upstairs in my house.  And I'm about to take it to somebody here on the island [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] to see if they can repair it and find out something about it.  But I do remember him playing the guitar.
Story_ID: 228344
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden].  What kind of personality, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My mother was a very, very outgoing person.  She loved people.  She was always very pleasant, very optimistic.  She was a homemaker throughout my lifetime, although I do remember in World War II [WWII], I'll never forget it; World War II, the war industry, they were taking women into the factories.  And so she started going--she worked for maybe three or four months during World War II.  And I remember her going to work, I don't--it was four or five in the afternoon and not getting home until midnight.  And that was quite different for me to have her going to work, but that was because of the war.  My mother loved to read, but she read mostly mysteries.  She loved to read mysteries.  She was a fiction person.  I'm just the opposite.  I don't like fiction.  But she loved to read.  And she loved to cook.  I think she got that from my Grandmother [Fannie] Hughes.  She loved to cook.  And I don't think a day went by when I was growing up from infancy to being a teenager that we didn't have dessert every day of the week.  She was big on dessert.  And if she couldn't make it, she'd go buy something.  So we always had dessert.
Speaker 1: Let's pause here a second.
Speaker 2: (INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You were asking me about my mother.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Right.
Speaker 2: One of her other longtime, lifetime passions and interests were antiques.  And if you'll look around this room, you may notice that there are a lot of antiques in here.  Some of the antiques that she acquired years ago and others that I have picked up.  She liked bottles, and I have been a bottle collector.  I have over two hundred bottles, mostly antique bottles.  And so, that's something that she passed on to me.
Speaker 1: And what kind of bottles?  Can you give us an idea of the kind of bottles that she--
Speaker 2: Food bottles.  Medicine bottles.  Perfume bottles.  Liquor bottles.  I have in my bedroom or in my den a table that's filled with ink bottles, probably twenty different types of ink bottles.  And soda bottles.  Particularly medicine bottles, being interested in the health sciences and medicine.  I'm very interested in medical bottles.
Story_ID: 228345
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] have a chance to go to--well, what was her education like?  Where did she get her education from?
Speaker 2: She finished high school in Boston [Massachusetts], Roxbury Memorial High School [Boston, Massachusetts].  And had an interest in art and studying art.  And I do remember that she told me that she did go to art school maybe for a year or two, but she never finished any program at the Museum of Fine Arts [Boston, Massachusetts]; so the Mass College of Art [Massachusetts School of Art; Massachusetts College of Art and Design, Boston, Massachusetts].  But that was her, as I understand, her interest in terms of occupation.  But she got married in 1934.  She was twenty-four years old.  I don't know between high school graduation and going to art school for a little bit (unclear) times she got married, I'm not sure what she did during those years.  She never talked about working, but I assumed she must have.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the only time that she worked when you were coming along, was during the war [World War II; WWII]?
Speaker 2: That's the only--well, no.  Then after I grew up and was an adult and had moved away and married and had my own family, and my brother [William H. Hayden] also grew up and went to college and moved on, she went to State Teachers College--Bridgewater State Teachers College [Bridgewater State University, Bridgewater, Massachusetts], and started taking courses and became a substitute teacher in the New Bedford Public Schools [Massachusetts].  She had had some college credits from the art school, and then with these courses that she was able to take: one here, one there, particularly during the summer, and she got on the substitute list.  And she was so good, from what she told me, I believe she was as a substitute that they kept her on as a permanent sub.  So essential, she was a full-time teacher for at least ten years.  So after my brother and I were adults and were gone and married, she was teaching school.  So she did have a career, and it lasted all of ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had to find something to do.  I mean, she was home alone, and my father [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] was still living at the time.  But, you know, she'd find--she always had to keep herself busy.  And so she was able to go to work as a teacher, and she loved every bit of that.
Story_ID: 228346
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Well, his name was mine, Robert Carter Hayden [Sr.]; I'm a junior, but I don't use the junior; but his is Robert Carter Hayden.  He was born in June of 1906 in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  His father, William Henry Hayden, was a school custodian, a janitor.  His mother [Parthenia C. Hayden] was a homemaker.  He finished New Bedford High School [New Bedford, Massachusetts], took some courses in bookkeeping or accounting, and worked for thirty-two years in the New Bedford post office.  So he was a postal employee for approximately thirty-two years before he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Well, later on today I'm going to show you a picture.  My great-grandfather, John D. Hayden [ph.], was born in Stafford County [Virginia]--Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1830.  In 1862, John D. Hayden, my great-grandfather, had a wife and four children.  He owned his own home and farmland in Fredericksburg, Virginia; and according to his obituary, in the year 1900, he was burned out of his home and his farm by the rebels during the Civil War.  And he came to New Bedford, Massachusetts, with his wife and four children.  Why New Bedford?  As you probably know, New Bedford was one of the centers of the Underground Railroad, had a large Quaker population, and many of the fugitive slaves and many of the free blacks who left the South, particularly, Virginia, pre- and post-Civil War, came to New Bedford, Massachusetts.  I learned through research that he had a brother, Washington Hayden [ph.], who had preceded him to New Bedford.  So that's how the Haydens got to New England, got to Massachusetts, got to New Bedford, Massachusetts.  My great-grandfather, John D. Hayden, proceeded to have five more children; so there were five--nine children in all.  One of those children, of course, was my father's father.  His name was William Henry Hayden, who would have been my grandfather.  My great-grandfather, John D. Hayden, was very interesting.  When he first came to New Bedford, he drove a cracker truck, which was essential a bread truck, delivering bread to homes.  He then went into farming, and had what was known as the Hayden Farm, out in Acushnet, Massachusetts, a little town just outside of New Bedford.  And then he gave up farming and got into real estate.  And I've learned through research in the court records in New Bedford that he bought and sold over thirty pieces of property during a twenty or twenty-five year period, and then he delivered mail; he was a postman.  So my great-grandfather, John D. Hayden, was a very active, very energetic, very ambitious man who did all these different things during his life but died in 1900.  So that would be my father's grandfather, my great-grandfather, John D. Hayden.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so, he was born in Petersburg [Virginia], acquired property in--I mean, his--your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  John D. Hayden was one.  Well, his obituary says Stafford County, but essentially it was Fredericksburg, and that's where I assume he was raised.  And I'm still doing research on his sister and Washington Hayden, the brother who has disappeared; I don't know whatever happened to him, but I do know his roots in Fredericksburg, and I do know what happened to him in New Bedford.
Story_ID: 228347
Speaker 1: What was your father [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] like and what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He worked, essentially, in the [U.S.] post office.  He was a very quiet man, never joined anything, never went to church, was never part of any group.  He really just worked every day, was not very social; and, in fact, you know, I've taken some pictures out to show you later of my family, and I really don't have a picture of my father to show you.  I guess he never wanted his picture taken either.  So I don't have any pictures of him that, you know, we've kept--that I've kept over the years or that I've kept out over the years, so he was a very private person.  You really didn't know what he was thinking most of the time.
Speaker 1: Did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And that was quite different, 'cause my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden], you know, was very outgoing, very open and quite different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, so he lived the balance of his life in New Bedford [Massachusetts]?  He really didn't--
Speaker 2: He lived all of his life in New Bedford.  In fact, he--we left New Bedford--he left New Bedford only once in my memory, and that was to take my brother [William H. Hayden] and I to Washington, D.C.  I guess my parents had decided that we were then, I think, fifteen and sixteen years of age and about to finish high school, and we needed to begin to see a part of the world.  And so, we took this motor trip from New Bedford to Washington.  I'll--you like to hear stories.  I was so excited that we're going to Washington, D.C.  I really had no concept of how many miles or how many days, but I knew it was a long trip, and I was thinking, "Oh, we're going to be eating in restaurants, and we're going to be staying in hotels."  I'll never forget.  About two or three days before we were to leave on this motor trip, my father came home with four or five loaves of bread, four or five pounds of bologna, peanut butter, like he was packing for a big picnic.  Well, indeed he was packing all the food for the back of the trunk of the car, because it was the first time he had ever gone south of New York.  And going south into Maryland, Baltimore [Maryland], he didn't know where we could be--where we could stop to eat.  Right?  This was 1953, 1954.  So I'll never forget that.  And when we got to Baltimore, I remember eight o'clock or the night before we landed in Washington, D.C., and we were out of food.  We had eaten all the sandwiches and had drunk all the milk or whatever, the liquids, refreshment that he had in the cooler.  And so, we were driving around Baltimore at night, at ten o'clock at night, and he was rolling the window down and asking, where can we eat, where can we be served.  I'll never forget that.  That was his only trip that I can remember that he ever left New Bedford.  I mean, he was a home person.  He just stayed in that city, and did his daily chores and so on.
Story_ID: 228348
Speaker 1: He [Hayden's father, Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] had some health problems, and as I remember, was going to the doctor, and I think the health problems told him that he should not work as long as he could have, as I recall.  And I don't even know what the health problems were.  I mean, this is an example of what I said earlier that my father didn't share an awful lot, so you didn't know what was going on.  As I recall, he said he was taking--he didn't go work for so many days and so many weeks and so many months and, you know, something's going on, I mean because he used to go to work every day.  He never missed a day of work.  Well, he had taken a leave of absence for health reasons, but he never told us that.  And then he just let--as I understand it, as I remember it, he just let that kind of run into retirement, and he stopped working.  And he never said, "I'm retired," you know.  He just kind of stayed away and stayed away, and then you understood that he wasn't working anymore.
Speaker 2: A very, very private person.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Very private person.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Did he have a chance to go to school or anything, you know, when he was coming up?
Speaker 1: Well, he went to school in Boston [Massachusetts] and took courses in accounting.  So he had some basic accounting, and that's what he did in the post office.  That's what he did in the post office, but he rose up in the ranks, you know.  The U.S. Postal Service, I think, was a place of employment opportunity for black people throughout the 20th century.  And I believe that when he did finally leave postal work, he had moved up to be supervisor of window service.  So he actually supervised, you know, the tellers who sold the stamps and took the packages and did all that.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell me, how many siblings do you have and where do you rank?
Speaker 1: I just have one brother [William H. Hayden] and he's about three years younger.  He was born in 1940.  And he's been in banking, investment banking, for at least three decades.
Story_ID: 228349
Speaker 1: What is your earliest childhood memory--do you have one?
Speaker 2: I guess, really the memories that I think about often are those trips to my [maternal] grandmother's [Fannie Hughes] house, my grandparents' house in the summers when I was very young; four or five, six, seven years of age.  You know, going from New Bedford [Massachusetts], which is really a small city of 100,000 people, and going to Boston [Massachusetts], and going to a big city, and riding the subway, and being at my grandmother's house; she had a three-floor house with, you know, seven or eight bedrooms; and, just being in this big house and being in the city.  We were in the Dudley Street Station [Dudley Square] area of Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].  So we had open fish markets and meat markets and produce and so on.  So I remember those summers.  And I loved the smells and the sounds and the sights of being in Boston.  My grandmother was a great cook, and she loved to cook.  And I remember she would go out and buy these chickens and the heads were still on the chickens; most of the feathers were still on, too.  So you had to clean your chickens in those days.  But she would be up until six or seven o'clock in the morning cleaning the chickens and broiling them and making chicken salad.  So those memories of being with my grandmother.  And then I guess my grandmother, then getting on the train during the summertime, she would also come to New Bedford to stay with us for a week or two; and sometimes she'd come on Christmas and stay two or three days for Christmas.  So the memories of my grandmother always stand out in my mind.  I often told my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] this and if she understood it.  She said, I used to say to my mother, you know, "Your mother, my grandmother, I think was as influential in my life as you've been."  And that was not to down my mother.  My mother said, "I understand what you mean."  My grandmother then was a homemaker.  Right.  But I know she was just such a gracious person.  And I remember my grandmother always making me feel good about myself.  And I don't remember all the details, but that's what stands out in my mind.  My other memories, I think, I grew up on a street, typical neighborhood street.  But I lived only a block from a very large park called Buttonwood Park [New Bedford, Massachusetts].  And it had a zoo, it had tennis courts, it had basketball courts, it had softball fields.  And I would say I grew up in Buttonwood Park.
Speaker 1: Now, that's in New Bedford.  Right?
Speaker 2: In New Bedford.  I could walk down the street to--I could walk to the end of the street probably in about three minutes and be in the park.  And that was the place that I went ice skating.  We had--they had a pond there.  So in the wintertime in those days, in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] it got quite cold.  It doesn't get as cold in New England as it used to.  But we have ice skating.  So sometimes we could skate for a week or two weeks at a time.  So Buttonwood Park meant a lot to me.  It was a place where I would hang out and play basketball, particularly on the open courts.  I remember even during the wintertime we would take our shovels and chop up the ice and move the slush and move the snow and wait for the court to dry up so we could play basketball with the snow all around the court, and we'd be out there with our gloves on shooting baskets.  So those were fun days to me.  I remember them very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your--did you live in a house or was it an apartment?
Speaker 2: No.  It was a single-family house.  They were--New Bedford primarily on the west end of the city had single and two-family houses.  In the south end and the north end of the city, you would find some apartments.  But most of the houses in New Bedford in the '40s [1940s], '50s [1950s], and even today, were single-family or two-or-three-family frame houses independently standing.  So we had our own house.
Story_ID: 228350
Speaker 1: Describe your neighborhood [in New Bedford, Massachusetts].  What was your neighborhood like?
Speaker 2: The immediate neighborhood at least for two or three, four miles around away from my house were all single-family houses with front lawns and driveways and garages and backyards; most of them two and three bedroom houses and old houses.  I think the house that my parents [Josephine Hughes Hayden and Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] bought when they got married in the '30s [1930s] had been built, I think, around 1930.  It was a fairly new house when they bought it.  So the houses were, when I grew up, at least fifty years old, some older.  But they're well over a hundred years now.  There were corner stores, so we didn't have supermarkets.  I remember the little corner grocery store, and--very, very tiny.  It almost wasn't much bigger than this room, believe it or not.  But they had the cereals and the milks and the butter and the bread and the meats, and so on.  So I could walk right around the corner to do the shopping for my mother.  And we usually shopped, seems like sometimes, on a daily basis.  I mean you didn't go to supermarkets and buy for a week.  You go out and buy for two or three days at a time.  My elementary school was probably seven, no more than ten minutes away.  I could walk to school and walk back.  It was the Thomas [R.] Rodman [Elementary] School [New Bedford, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Thomas?
Speaker 2: Rodman.  R-O-D-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Rodman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A redbrick school.  And I remember they had eight grades.  I believe we had grades one to eight.  No kindergarten.  I had gone to a different school for kindergarten.  The classes were, oh, twenty, twenty-four students.  It was all self-contained.  You had the same teacher for every subject all day.  And then at the end of the seventh grade, I was expecting to graduate from elementary school, grade eight from the Rodman School.  But because of overcrowding in the school system at the time, they moved the eighth grade classes from the elementary schools to two junior or middle high schools; one on the south end, one on the north end.  And so I was bused down to the south end middle school for my eighth grade, my last year in elementary school.

Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in your neighborhood [in New Bedford, Massachusetts]?  And did you live in the same place most of the time?
Speaker 2: Oh, we lived in the same house.
Speaker 1: Same house?  Okay.
Speaker 2: We lived in the same house, yeah.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, my house was the second house in from the beginning of the street.  And my street ran from Buttonwood Park [New Bedford, Massachusetts] out to Kempton Street.  Now Kempton Street was a very commercial street, so that we had a big furniture store in sight of my house; there was a Chevrolet dealership; there were two gas stations on my end of the street; there was this small grocery store that I mentioned.  You walk down a block and there was a drug store.  There was a bakery.  So, I lived very close to a commercial area that had all the services that you needed.  You didn't really have to go downtown.  You had to go downtown to buy clothes.  We even had a branch library that was built into one of the storefronts of the commercial area.  So I remember a lot of commercialism.  I remember as a youngster, maybe four, five and six, we actually had trolley cars running on rails down Kempton Street, and that was in view of my house.  So it was a very busy commercial area in the late '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s].  And it got even more so.  In fact, some of the larger houses on Kempton Street were rezoned and turned into businesses.  So if you go there today, you see a veterinarian hospital; you see a house that now sells carpeting.  So you'll--I remember the commercialism.  A lot of commerce going on.  And that's one thing I remember, which was not typical for most people, though we just happened to live on that end of the street.  Living on the other end, you weren't exposed to all that.  Well, the other smells that I remember, my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] loved to cook, as I told you earlier.  She was always baking, always cooking.  And so, every day I had some idea what she was fixing, so I was looking forward to her casseroles and her baked goods and so on.  And I just--that was always the delightful part of my day, and in particular when I would come back from the park and play football or basketball or just hanging out and being tired and ready to eat.  So I remember the kitchen was always smelling good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So is this where you developed a taste for chicken livers and--
Speaker 2: No.  No.  My mother never had chicken livers in the house.  She never fixed chicken livers, and I don't think she--I don't know whether she even liked them.  No.  I came into chicken livers as an adult, and I don't remember my first experience with chicken livers.  But I did learn how to fix them, and I even have some in the freezer right now, so when I'm ready, I just thaw them out.
Story_ID: 228352
Speaker 1: What kind of a little boy were you?  What did you like to do and what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, it's interesting.  Being a researcher and historian--academic today, I didn't read very much.  I did not--I wasn't interested in reading.  I had to be forced to read a book.  I do remember this:  when I turned five years old, my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] walked me down to this branch library that I said was right--a block away from my house--took me to the library to get a library card.  I remember walking up to the desk and she got this library card, and now we have to get a book.  We have to get something to read.  And I was just learning to read.  I didn't know what I wanted to look at.  I remember the book that she pulled up.  It was a little, thin brown book.  It was about this big, brown cover, and it was the life of George Washington Carver.  And I remember she brought that book back, that one book, and she read the book to me.  And I'm convinced to this day that that generated and inspired my interests in the life sciences.  And as I may have told you, I majored in biology and chemistry, but there was something about George Washington Carver in that story that gripped me.  And so I became interested in plants and living things, and I was just in awe of George Washington Carver.  So, you asked me earlier, you know, what was my mother like.  Five years old, she got me that book and brought it home and read it to me.  But I didn't read a lot on my own, I really didn't, if I did any reading in elementary school [Thomas R. Rodman Elementary School, New Bedford, Massachusetts]--they didn't give homework in those days--so if I did any reading, it wasn't until I got to grade eight at the junior high school or high school [New Bedford High School, New Bedford, Massachusetts] that I started to read.  But I read only what I was assigned to read.  I didn't read beyond it.  I was not much of a reader.  I was an average student.  I was probably a C-plus, B-minus student; did better in the sciences than I did in English or math.  I was terrible in mathematics, and really didn't care for school that much, to be honest with you.  The only thing I liked in school was, when I got to high school, I loved the sciences.  I loved the sciences.  I guess I was a jock.  I loved to play sports.  I was a very good tennis player.  I worked as a youngster.  I shoveled snow.  We had huge snowstorms.  I would make tremendous money shoveling people's walks in the wintertime when it snowed.  I had a paper route.  I delivered papers for a while; six, seven or eight years.  I had a landscaping business.  There were people in my neighborhood who didn't--couldn't cut their grass, elderly people.  So I had a landscaping--I had regular customers every summer.  And then when I was twelve--I do remember this.  My father [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] did take me up to the golf course.  He used to caddy.  He was a caddy at New Bedford Country Club [Country Club of New Bedford, North Dartmouth, Massachusetts].  So he took me out, and I guess he knew somebody at the country club, and he left me there.  And at twelve or thirteen years of age, I became a caddy.  And from age fifteen until probably right through high school, even maybe through my first year in college [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], I caddied every summer at the New Bedford Country Club and caddied for, you know, some very wealthy men.  It was a private club, and made a great deal of money as a caddy.  So I would say as a teenager, I enjoyed working and caddying and having my landscape business.  I mean, I had saved enough money, by the time I finished high school at age seventeen in 1955, I had saved enough money--earned enough money 'cause I paid my way to college.
Story_ID: 228353
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about grade school [Thomas R. Rodman Elementary School, New Bedford, Massachusetts].  Now, you said you didn't like school very much.  But was there a teacher there that really made it--made school interesting on any level or mentored you or helped you?
Speaker 2: You know, I've often said this, and I still think it's true.  I thought about each class that I was in.  Grade one, grade two, grade three.  I can remember most of the teachers.  They were what we used to call old maids.  They were dull, boring.  If things were routine, repetitious, I really didn't enjoy--I remember I used to look at the clock, you know, waiting for the classes to be over.  But I do remember in the seventh grade, and I wish I could remember her name--I had a science teacher.  And somehow she brought things alive, 'cause we little hands-on experiments.  So she would do demonstrations.  So that was the best experience that I had in grades one to seven, as I remember.  The only other experience I remember that I liked was, I think I was in grade six or grade seven, and every Friday morning for half a year, we had carpentry.  But we didn't have carpentry in that elementary school.  We had to go to another elementary school about a half a mile away.  I would walk for the carpentry.  So I remember that science experience in grade seventh and the carpentry.  I think that was in grade seven.  That was elementary.  That was before I bused to the junior high school for grade eight.  I hated that grade eight experience, because I was now going to a much, much, larger school where they had three or four classes for each grade level.  All right?  And you moved from class to class.  But, again, I found the science teacher to be the most enjoyable guy.  He was--he didn't have much humor, and he was kind of straight and strict, but I enjoyed his science, and he was very precise in terms of explaining the science.  I remember astronomy, for example.  But I hated that experience, because I was put into a grade eight, junior high school in the south end of the city, with students of different cultures and backgrounds that I had not experienced before.  So I don't look back on my elementary school education as something that I really enjoyed that much.
Story_ID: 228354
Speaker 1: When you went to high school, was that different?  And what high school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to New Bedford High School [New Bedford, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that the only school in town?
Speaker 2: There was a vocational school.  There was [New] Bedford Vocational [High] School [Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School, New Bedford, Massachusetts].  I was, even though I enjoyed carpentry, I wasn't interested in electricity or plumbing.  I can tell you what I was interested in, and I was interested in biology.  And, you want me to tell you a story?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I went to New Bedford High School, there were 400-plus students in my class.  So the high school was about 1200 students, which was quite large for the '50s [1950s].  So we had a pretty large faculty.  Okay.  There were two black teachers in my high school, two black teachers.  I would say 95 percent, 98 percent of the students were white.  But there was one teacher in particular, his name was Mr. Felton, Melver [C.] Felton, who was born and raised in New Bedford.  He went to Lincoln University in [Lincoln University] Pennsylvania, and he majored in math.  He was the mathematics teacher.  And I think I had Mr. Felton for three of my four years of math.  Being interested in biology and the sciences, I had to take math every year.  I remember Mr. Felton knew me before I came to New Bedford High School, because he knew my family.  He knew my parents [Josephine Hughes Hayden and Robert C. Hayden, Sr.].  He knew my grandparents [Parthenia Carter Hayden and William Hayden].  It was a small black community, you know, during this (unclear).  So everybody knew everybody.  So Mr. Felton knew who I was.  And I remember Mr. Felton, I think it was my, maybe, second year in high school, "Well, [HistoryMaker] Robert [C. Hayden], now what are you going to do when you go to college?  What are you going to study?"  And I was taking biology at the time.  I said, "Mr. Felton, I'm going to be a biologist.  I'm going to study biology."  And I remember him saying to me, "But, be sure you get a liberal education."  My junior year I'm taking chemistry.  "Now, Robert," he asked me the same--"Robert, what are you working towards?  What are you aiming--what are you going to do?"  "Mr. Felton, biology."  But he would say to me, "But, Robert, be sure you get a liberal education."  My senior year, "Robert, what are your plans?"  "I'm going to study biology, Mr. Felton."  And I also want to tell you--you would have asked me this--I want to tell you about my getting into college.  But anyways, I knew that I wanted to study biology.  He kept telling me in my senior year, "But, Robert, be sure you get a liberal education."  Larry [Crowe], I didn't know what the word "liberal" meant.  For three years he kept saying "liberal," and I didn't know what he meant.  I never went to the dictionary to look it up, but he just said, "Get a liberal education."  I didn't ask my parents.  I don't remember asking anybody.  What's he talking about.  "Well, I--he said, get a liberal education."  So I just want to leave you with that story, and then when you--if you want to ask me about college--but I'll never forget that.  He kept--"What the heck he's talking about.  I just want to do biology."  He said, "That's fine.  But you got to get a liberal education."
Speaker 1: Now, how did you do in high school grade-wise?
Speaker 2: In biology, I did extremely well.  And I think that further motivated me to want to study biology and be a biologist, 'cause I did very well.  Okay.  It was didactic, it was very objective.  Okay.  We did have microscopes, not a lot of laboratory work.  The chemistry teacher was Mr. [Philip A.] Bronspiegel, a Jewish man, who was Phi Beta Kappa.  He had a degree in chemistry from Brown University [Providence, Rhode Island].  And I tell you, he made chemistry just fascinating to me.  I loved it.  I loved every bit of it.  And then I had a physics teacher, who was equally as good.  So I was inclined towards the sciences, and I had excellent instruction.  Okay.  I could care less about the French, the history, the English, and some of the other stuff we had to do.  I mean, I didn't like any of the readings, any of the classics.  All I was interested was in the science.  And parenthetically, I should add that I was not very good in mathematics.  That was my weakest subject, but I was still interested in going into science.
Story_ID: 228355
Speaker 1: What was your social life in high school [New Bedford High School, New Bedford, Massachusetts]--now, you said, you played basketball and those kinds of things.  Did you play any sports in high school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I didn't--I tell you, I didn't have a lot of social life for the following reason, that as I grew up, ages five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, most of my playmates were white.  Okay.  And those black students--we lived in the west end--most of the blacks lived in the west end area just outside of downtown.  We were further out in the west end, so most of my associates, as a child, as a young teenager, were white.  And most of the students in the high school were white.  Okay.  So we didn't have much of a social life.  My--I used to tell my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden], you know, as you get older being colored in New Bedford [Massachusetts]--as you get older, you found that these white so-called friends of yours, the ones you played basketball with, the ones that you may or may not go into their house and so on, they kind of just disappeared, you know.  I wasn't invited.  I wasn't included.  But my mother--and so, I told my mother, I said, "You know, I don't have any friends."  You know, "They belong to this and the white kids belong to that, but, you know, I just go to school."  And my mother knew what was happening.  And so she would take me to Boston [Massachusetts].  She would be sure that we would get to Boston frequently because she still had a lot of friends in Boston who had children my age.  So I had black friends.  I had black experience, but it was going to Boston.  And if my father [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] did one thing, he would listen to my mother and put us in the car and take us to Boston so we could be with black kids our age.  So--but when I got in high school, there were more black students.  There were probably half a dozen of us, and we were somewhat close.  But, again, we lived in different parts of the neighborhood.  So it was--you know, I kept busy with my jobs, I did my homework faithfully.  I loved to write.  I said earlier that I really didn't care for the English classes.  I didn't.  I didn't like to read the classics and the short stories and the poems and all that stuff.  I mean, I went through the motions, so--but I loved to write.  One thing, I spent a lot of time writing.  And I enjoyed writing, and I did well at it.  I have papers, the papers I submitted in high school, usually, you know, were given pretty good grades and good comments.  So I liked to write at that time.  But at that time, wasn't really thinking about being a journalist or being a writer.  You know, I was still interested in the sciences.  But writing was always something I'd enjoyed doing.
Story_ID: 228356
Speaker 1: Was music or television a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, my father [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] was one of those who didn't get a television until very, very late.  Everybody else had a television, we didn't have a television.  And I don't exactly know why, but I guess, you know--as I said, my father wasn't into current events and what was going on, and so, he didn't need a television.  But I remember when we got a television, and I believe it was the 1954 World Series.  And he did like baseball.  And I guess he wanted to see the World Series, and so, a television appears.  He didn't tell us he was going to buy one.  He didn't us--this television showed up, and it just plugged in and it sat on a little table.  It was the World Series, you know.  You know, you asked me something else about my memories, sights and sounds.  The other thing that my parents [Josephine Hughes Hayden and Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] did, which was very important, as I recall.  Any time the Brooklyn Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers] came to Boston [Massachusetts] in the summer to play the old Boston Braves [Atlanta Braves], we would go to Boston and go to those games so that I could see Jackie Robinson.  And so, I grew up with Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe of the early Brooklyn Dodgers.  And that was an important part of my growing up.  I used to go with little white cards and my pen, and I would get there early 12:30, quarter to one; they're having batting practice.  And I would go right down to the edge of the box seats.  And in those days, some of the players would actually come over and--autographs. And I must have gotten a half a dozen of Jackie Robinson's autographs on my little white cards.  I wish I had those today.
Speaker 1: Oh, you don't have them anymore?
Speaker 2: No.  But I do have a box downstairs of Jackson Robinson memorabilia, things I've been collecting that I'm not sure what I'm going to do with yet, but I--so that was an important sight and sound of my experience that my parents provided for me.  And--because you didn't have a big black presence in New Bedford [Massachusetts].  And as I said, my father was involved in social life and community life.  My mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] was to some extent, but where was still always back in Boston.  See, her mother [Fannie Hughes] was there, and her closest friends were in Boston.  So Boston was kind of my second home.  And I had some other relatives in Boston on my father's side.  And so, we would visit.  And so, I always had my mind and my eye on being in Boston and looking forward to being there for a day, or for the summer, or whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you play any sports in school?
Speaker 2: I mentioned earlier that there were two black teachers at New Bedford High School [New Bedford, Massachusetts].  Walter [W.] Bonner was the other teacher, born and raised in New Bedford; and everybody knew the Bonner family.  He taught English.  He also went to Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] and came back and taught.  And he was the tennis coach.  And I told you I spent a lot of time on Buttonwood Park [New Bedford, Massachusetts].  I developed all my interests in athletics on Buttonwood Park.  And they had at least eight or twelve tennis courts, I mean huge tennis courts.  And he was the tennis coach.  And I learned to play tennis.  And I was good at tennis, and so I played on the tennis team.  I played on the tennis team.  I think the reason--I really wanted to play football and some other things, but I think I was so busy working; I had my paper route delivering papers every afternoon that it precluded my going out for practice and playing other organized sports.  But I was on the tennis team.
Story_ID: 228357
Speaker 1: I think you mentioned that church was not a big factor in growing up at all.
Speaker 2: Church?
Speaker 1: Church.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] started us at the Methodist church, which was about two blocks away, out in that commercial area [in New Bedford, Massachusetts] that we talked about.  And we would go to Sunday school, but it wasn't something that meant a lot to me, as I recall.  It doesn't mean a thing to me today.  My father [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] never ever set foot in a church that I can remember.  He never went to any church.  And I find that surprising, because my great-grandfather [John D.] Hayden [ph.], my great--and we got to talk about my other great-grandfather, Carter, on my father's mother's side were very active church people in New Bedford [Massachusetts], in the Baptist church.  Very, very strong church people.  And my father's father, my grandfather [William H. Hayden], was active in the church.  My grandfather and great-grandfather were active in the Knights of Pythias, and the [Independent Order of] Odd Fellows, and the Masons.  But my father was never part of any kind of organized activity, including the church.  And so--well, we did go to church for a few years, went to Sunday school.  But that was my mother's doing.  That was my mother's doing.
Speaker 1: And it was a Methodist Church?
Speaker 2: It was a Methodist Church.
Speaker 1: It was a A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] or a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  It was just a--
Speaker 1: Did she--
Speaker 2: --well, there was an A.M.E. church, and there was a Union Baptist church.  And I don't--I never understand why my father never took us to Union Baptist 'cause all of his family went through the Union Baptist church, which was the black church in New Bedford in the 1800s.  My great-grandparents were both very prominent in Union Baptist.  Union Baptist is still the largest black Baptist church in Bedford today.  But my father never went to Union Baptist church.  Never.  He never was part of any church.
Story_ID: 228358
Speaker 1: Baseball, you know, sports, I guess, is the most recreational thing that you can remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that was--consumed a lot of my time as I was growing up, nine, ten, eleven, into my teenage years.  Today, I'm a passionate, avid, obsessed golfer.  I play golf every day I can.  And as a caddy, when I was caddying in New Bedford [Massachusetts], we started playing golf on Mondays.  That was caddy day.  So I developed a love of the game of golf as a caddy.  We didn't have a golf team in high school.  And I didn't play in college, but--'cause I wasn't that good.  And I had to work when I was in college, so I mean I was working all the time I was going through college.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, tell me about college.  Now, how did you decide on what college to go to?  And did you think you were going to college in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I always thought I was going to college, but I'm not sure where I got that motivation from, because my father [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] never talked to me about college.  He never had a notion about college.  It just wasn't in his vocabulary.  I always had a sense from my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] that I was to be studying and doing well and was going to go to college.  And even though my mother didn't go to college, when she was in Boston [Massachusetts] in the 1920s and '30s [1930s], she was in a circle of a number of illustrious black college men who were in Boston at the time.  Plus she had friends while I was growing up who had been to college.  So I knew of black men, her friends and so on.  Bob Weaver [Robert C. Weaver] was in college, the late Bob Weaver.  Former Judge William [H.] Hastie [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Robert C. Weaver there--
Speaker 2: Yes.  And Bill Hastie were in college at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] during the late-'20s [1920s] (unclear).  So my mother knew these people.  So she would tell me about them.  And in fact, my mother used to date Bill Hastie.  And when he left Harvard, you know, he left my mother that summer and wrote her a letter apologizing for leaving Boston so abruptly without saying good-bye to my mother.  And she saved that letter all these years.  I still have it.  And Bill Hastie had just finished [Harvard] Law School [Cambridge, Massachusetts] and had gotten a job in the federal government in Washington, D.C.  But getting back to your question about college, I, upon my own, decided that I would apply to three colleges.  And I guess you got the applications through the high school, as I remember.  I mean, it was a little bit of help from the high school, but not an awful lot, particularly for black students, or colored students as we were called.  The high school guidance office didn't give us much attention.  But I remember three colleges I applied to.  Northeastern University [Boston, Massachusetts] in Boston.  Why?  Because Northeastern, at that time and now, has a co-op plan, which means you can work; half of your college time you can work full time and earn college tuition and get experience.  So you could work and earn money at Northeastern.  University of Massachusetts Amherst [(U Mass Amherst), Amherst, Massachusetts] I applied to because it was so inexpensive for state students.  I mean, it cost pennies to go to U Mass.  And I had my money, but it was the money factor.  I'll go to U Mass Amherst, it's so cheap; six hundred bucks a year for everything, 'cause I remember at that time.  Then I applied to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  Why?  As you know, I've been going to Boston as a child, as a teenager; my grandmother [Fannie Hughes] still lived in Boston, I had family in Boston.  And so I went--applied to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  Come mid-spring of 1955, I'm about to graduate from New Bedford High School [New Bedford, Massachusetts].  I get rejected by Northeastern, I get rejected by U Mass Amherst, and I got rejected by Boston University.  So I had three rejections.  And I had nobody helping me think, well, what am I going to do.  I wasn't going in the [U.S.] military.  I wasn't about to.  You know, there was a draft still in effect.  I could have--I wasn't going in the military.  I didn't know what I was going to do.  Lo' and behold, I received a letter from Boston University on a Saturday to take an examination.  And I remember getting on the bus going to Boston, finding my way over to Boston University, walking into this large hall of a hundred, two hundred students and taking a two or three-hour.  And it had to do with admissions.  Okay.  And I didn't meet anybody that day.  I just showed up and took a seat and they gave me an exam.  Well, about three weeks later, I got an acceptance letter from Boston University.  I guess, 'cause they gave me another chance and I took the exam.  It's like an aptitude test or something, achievement test.  That was the only school that accepted me, and that's how I ended up going to Boston University.  I was lucky, fortunate, okay, to go to Boston University.  My grandmother was still there.  I had friends who were there.  I had some other relatives on my father's side.  So that's how I ended up at Boston University.  And I was going to Boston University to do one thing, and that was to major in biology.
Story_ID: 228359
Speaker 1: Now, '55 [1955], Boston University [(BU), Boston, Massachusetts].  I'm not sure, but correct me if I'm wrong.  Now, you graduated in '55 [1955]--went to Boston U in '55 [1955].  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, was--[Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was either just leaving or?
Speaker 2: Dr. King had left the year before.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: He had left the year before to go to Alabama. He had finished his theology work in 1954 [sic. 1955].  And when I went BU in 1955, and you probably know this, there were so few students of color in college in Boston [Massachusetts] and greater Boston, we all knew each other.  There was a small group of blacks in college at that time in Boston.  Okay.  And I remember I met two or--eventually became my best friends, fraternity brothers.  But we decided to go to Marsh Chapel [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] on a Sunday.  We had been to BU maybe two or three weeks just out of--we'll go to Marsh Chapel, the big chapel in the center of the BU campus.  And we're sitting there waiting for the eleven o'clock service to start and sitting in the pew.  It was a huge chapel.  And this black man walks out, I mean he was black, with this black robe with the red something around it.  That was Dean Howard Thurman.  And we looked at each other.  We had never heard of Howard Thurman before.  Prior to coming to Boston University as dean of the chapel, he was dean of the chapel and head of theology at Howard University [Washington, D.C.], as you probably know.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: So that was quite an experience, you know, as a seventeen, eighteen-year-old freshman, and here's this black man walking out and he was the head of the chapel.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  He's a legendary (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh--
Speaker 1: --theologian and author of many books--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --of about a dozen books.  He, you know, we've had a lot of people that we've interviewed over the past three years or so talk about Howard Thurman bringing students to his house on the Howard campus; his input into the philosophy of non-violent direct action (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --telling people what they owe to God, and you know, and all that sort of thing--
Speaker 2: Well, as I've read in the history, I know he was a mentor and minister for Martin Luther King and then so many other blacks who came through Boston.  There were a number of black students supporting him who came through Boston before my time, and a lot of the civil rights leaders and Boston had touched them in one way or another.  And before I got there in 1955, you know, Maynard Jackson had gone to law school there before I arrived.  The late congresswoman from Texas, Barbara [C.] Jordan, she was at BU law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts], already in law school when I arrived and others of us arrived as freshmen when she was there.  I got to know her, and I remember she came to Tufts University [Medford, Massachusetts] many years later for an honorary degree or something like that.  And I went to the convocation and they had a reception afterwards, and the reception goes like that to Barbara, and she says, "Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], hi."  I said, "Barbara."  She said, "What are you doing now?"  This was like fifteen years later.  She says, "What are you doing now?  I hope you're not still at BU."  (Laughter) Before I could say what I was doing--"I hope you're still not at BU."  You know, she was just joking, you know.  But anyway, I ended up in Boston, at Boston University.
Story_ID: 228360
Speaker 1: So you said the freshmen were required to stay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were required to live, and I was assigned to Myles Standish Hall.  And as I recall, there must have been four or five hundred men in that dormitory.  There were girls' dormitories around, two very large ones.  I really didn't know a soul going to Boston University [(BU), Boston, Massachusetts].  I just met new people and friends when I got there.  There were four or five, including myself, black students in Myles Standish, and we very quickly bonded.  As I say, there were so few black students in Boston [Massachusetts] at the time, that--and being interested and having a social life, there were fraternities, Kappa Alpha Psi [Fraternity], Omega Psi Phi [Fraternity], Alpha Phi Alpha [Fraternity].  And so, that influence was there.  And there were other black students who, of course, had been there for three or four years and had the fraternities and the sororities going.  So everything seemed to quickly congeal around the AKAs [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority], the Deltas [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], Omegas, Kappas, and so on.  And so early on--
Speaker 1: Were there, like, citywide chapters of those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  There were citywide chapters.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay.
Speaker 2: There were citywide chapters.  And there were several--well, there were Omegas and Kappas at BU.  And we quickly came together as a group, 'cause there weren't that many of us in Boston, you know.  So I pledged Omega Psi Phi immediately because, as I said earlier, my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] had friends who were still in Boston who had gone to college and were Omegas.  And that's all I ever heard of growing up was Omegas.  So I pledged Omega.  But all the Kappas that I had met, and plus those who had pledged Kappa the very first year, and there were about five that were freshmen with me, they had a Kappa basketball team.  And, of course, they all expected that I was going to be a Kappa.  I went Omega.  But I was playing basketball with the Kappas.  They let me play with them, even though I went Omega.  Well, I was working and I wasn't doing that well in some of my courses.  I dropped out of the fraternity Omega, and the second year I pledged Kappa.  I became a Kappa in April of 1957.  I say that only because joining and pledging Kappa Alpha Psi and becoming Kappa was a very important experience for me, and I mean, good experience for me.  And it helped to sustain me through my four years of college at Boston University.  The comradeship, the social life, which I didn't have growing up in high school [New Bedford High School, New Bedford, Massachusetts], you know, came to me once I got to college.  And I remember the motto--I guess you call motto, I forget what they call it now--for Kappa Alpha Psi was achievement.  It started dah dah dah achievement through dah dah dah.  And I really got motivated by that.  We had to be achievers, you know.  So I worked hard.  The other thing I remember about Kappa was that the materials that you had to study and learn to be accepted in the fraternity, you had to learn about the founders of Omega and the founders of Kappa.  And I remember the ten pictures of the founders of Kappa Alpha Psi, and they had their pictures in the book and told where they had gone to college and what they had achieved professionally.  And I was just in awe of these black men I'd never heard before, but their accomplishments as lawyers, as journalists, as business people.  And so Kappa meant a lot to me at Boston University.  And the other thing that was important to me was studying biology, which was--which was my major.
Story_ID: 228361
Speaker 1: How was the biology?  Were you the only black in the biology department?
Speaker 2: No.  Howell Howard [ph.].  We called him Howdy.  He and I were both biology majors, and we met during registration time and actually George Beasley [ph.].  We all met during registration, freshmen registration.  And George--we all had to take biology, but Howdy and I were majoring in biology.  So I had two or three close friends and ultimately Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity] brothers who were studying biology along with me.  And so that was important.  But Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] was very, very large.  It's even larger today.  It's over twenty thousand students.  It was very, very large, and I did have a little problem trying to deal with the immensity of the place and the large numbers of students and the faculty we had to deal with.  I didn't do what Melver [C.] Felton told me to do, my math teacher in high school [New Bedford High School, New Bedford, Massachusetts], when he said, "Get a liberal education."  I went to Boston University and I stayed away from the social sciences.  I stayed away from economics, and I took as much science as I could; biology, the chemistry, organic chemistry, qualitative analysis, the physics; everything that relate to the biology that I was doing.  But then when I got to become a junior, in order to graduate, of course, you had to have courses in the other disciplines.  So I had to take philosophy, I had to take religion, I had to take economics, I had to psychology; I had put all those things aside, but I'd done all the biology.  I took every biology course you could possibly take, every chemistry course I could possibly take.  And then I finally had to catch up with the liberal arts subjects.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is like '58 [1958] or '59 [1959]?
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959], yes.  So by '58 [1958] and '59 [1959], I had gotten--and then I fell in love with sociology.  I took sociology.  I didn't know what it was, but I took sociology and took psychology to get that liberal education.  And I was really changed by those courses.  I found psychology and sociology as fascinating.  And so they complemented my major of biology.  I finished college in three and a half years.  I wanted to get out.  I was working part-time, full-time in the summers.  And I decided to stay in Boston [Massachusetts] and work one summer after my junior year.  I did a whole half a year's of college work during the summer.  You had two, six-week terms.  And so I did a half a year's work, semester's work in the summer.  So I actually finished all my coursework in January of 1959.  So I did it in three and a half years.  Three and a half years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had like a B.S. in biology?  Is that what it was?
Speaker 2: I got a B.S. in biology with a minor in chemistry.
Story_ID: 228362
Speaker 1: So what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Well, when I graduated and I walked out of Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] after taking my last exam in January of 1959, I wanted to do laboratory work.  It just so happened that a long block down from Boston University campus was the famous Lahey Clinic [Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, Burlington, Massachusetts].  And having a bent towards the medical sciences, I knew they had laboratories at Lahey Clinic, and I walked into Lahey Clinic, filled out an application.  That very day, within an hour to two hours, I was taken over to the chemistry lab.  I was interviewed by the director of the lab, and I was employed that very day.  It took me one day to find a job in the chemistry lab, hematology lab at the Lahey Clinic.  And so I started working full-time in the laboratory where a lot of the biology and chemistry I had taken was useful, was practical, and meant something to me.  So I was in the chemistry lab at the Lahey Clinic.  I'd decided at that point that I wanted to work with people.  I didn't want to work in a lab.  I had taken psychology, had taken sociology; had not had any experience in the field working in communication agencies or (unclear)--I knew I wanted to work with people.  Well, I was also eligible for the draft if I had finished my college work.  I was eligible to be drafted.  I was not going to go in the [U.S.] military.  I was not going to have my life taken away from me.  That was my position at the time.  I decided I was going to be a science teacher.  So that spring, I immediately applied to the Boston University School of Education [Boston, Massachusetts]--graduate school--to get a master's degree in science education.  And I started taking courses that spring and that summer, and I was admitted into a master's program in September of 1959.  So I was a full-time graduate student in education, science education, and working full-time at the Lahey Clinic.  I was able to do that because of the way the courses were offered.  And so, in 1961, continuing to work at the Lahey Clinic, I received my master's degree in science education.
Story_ID: 228363
Speaker 1: So did you start working in the public schools then in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: I had wanted to do my student teaching in the Boston Public Schools [BPS].  But my advisor and professor of science education, the late John Reed said, "I don't want you in the Boston schools."  The Boston schools were not good at that time, and they weren't good after that and they're not very good now.  He said, "I don't want you teaching--learning, getting your teaching," what do you call "student teaching in the Boston schools."  And in those days, all you had to do was eight weeks of student teaching to get that part of your certification.  He said, "I want you in the Newton Public Schools [Newton, Massachusetts]."  He sent me out to Newton [Massachusetts], and I did my student teaching at Newton North High School [Newton High School, Newton, Massachusetts] in a biology classroom under a biology teacher. And I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, tell us about Newton.
Speaker 2: Well, Newton, at that time--we're talking about 1961; 1960 roughly, '61 [1961]--was a predominantly white suburban community, very wealthy, predominantly Jewish, with very few black families, at least in the early '60s [1960s].  I then applied for a job as a science teacher in Newton, and the superintendent interviewed me and sent me down to [John Wingate] Weeks Junior High School [Newton, Massachusetts], where I was interviewed.  And I was offered a job as a junior high school science teacher.  And that was 1961, I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-one [1961].
Story_ID: 228364
Speaker 1: Through your college career, I didn't ask you this, but did you have--is there any teacher that stood out as a mentor or outstanding teacher that you can tell us about--
Speaker 2: At Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: --at Boston University, yeah.
Speaker 2: Dr. John Reed, who was professor of science education, and was well-known across the country as one of the top science educators.  He was very active in the National Science Foundation [NSF], well connected to the organizations of science teaching.  And he had a lot of faith in me, and he really mentored me along and gave me a lot of opportunity, and gave me the opportunity to go to Newton [Massachusetts] as a student teacher.  And, therefore, I was able to start my career as a teacher in a top-flight school system.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're just going to pause here for a second.
Speaker 2: (INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: How do you spell Reed?
Speaker 2: R-E-E-D.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Anybody else that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I mentioned Dr. Du Bois, because he was the only black or African American college instructor that I had through my undergraduate and graduate years at Boston University.  And he was a specialist in adult education.  And getting my master's degree at Boston University--I'm sorry I'm jumping ahead.  I had Dr. Du Bois when I was in a doctoral program, and so I'm jumping ahead.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would say Dr. John Reed probably was the teacher I remember the most at BU.  I can't remember anybody as an undergraduate student that stands out in my life at that time nor going through the master's degree program and--other than Dr. John Reed.
Story_ID: 228365
Speaker 1: So you started teaching in Newton [Massachusetts], Newton Junior High School?
Speaker 2: [John Wingate] Weeks Junior High School [Newton, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Weeks Junior High School in Newton--
Speaker 2: --in Newton Massachusetts.  And Newton at that time was a flagship school system in America.  I mean it was one of the top school systems.  It was lined up with Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], had all those Harvard resources.  It was a great school system to be in and to learn in.  I must say that I was the fifth black teacher to be hired in Newton.  There were four other black teachers teaching in the system when I got there.  So I did have some support.  I knew two or three of them before I got there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is 1961.  This is right after the--this is the beginning of the New Frontier.  Right, with the [President John Fitzgerald] Kennedy--
Speaker 2: Right.  This is post-Sputnik.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: This is when science education was part of national defense.  One of the reasons that I got a deferment when I finished my undergraduate work is that I was a full-time student in science education at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]; i.e., remember President [Dwight David "Ike"] Eisenhower said anybody who's trained to be a teacher, that's part of our national defense, they're automatically deferred.  Science teachers, going to be a science educator, I got automatic deferment.  So, yeah, that was right at the beginning of the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yeah.  A New Frontier that Kennedy talked about; we got NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration], more money is being pumped into NASA; goal to put a man on the moon; had seven astronauts now that are--I think are--when did the first orbiting of the Earth was '59 [1959] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was a short orbit.  Yeah.  It Alan Shepard.  Alan Shepard from [Derry] New Hampshire.
Speaker 1: Alan Shepard, was that '59 [1959] or--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Roughly.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty [1960], yeah [sic. 1961].
Speaker 2: A lot of that's way back, so I don't remember the dates like I used to.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And John Glenn finally orbited--I mean, now, he went around, you know.  I think they shot Shepard into space, and then Glenn was the first one to go around, I think.
Speaker 2: Around it.  You're right.
Speaker 1: And so, it was a lot of talk about science, you know, in those days. Science was--
Speaker 2: So I was heavily involved as a science teacher, in science education, for all the four years.  Taught biology, taught physical science, taught Earth science, taught general science; grades seven, eight and nine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was that experience like for you?  I mean, did you really enjoy that?
Speaker 2: Exhilarating.  I mean, I enjoyed teaching.  I learned each year as I went along.  I was in a school that had a lot of good teachers, a lot of good educators, a lot of good outside resources.  There was plenty of money in Newton at the time.  It was--the taxes were really contributing well to the school system, so it was a good experience.
Speaker 1: So you didn't like the laboratory work 'cause it was isolating, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I really decided that I didn't want to do research or work in the lab.  I really enjoyed working with young people and working with people, and that's why I went into teaching.  I said, well, since I want to work with people, what can I do now that I have this degree in biology and minor in chemistry.  Okay.  I'm interested in science.  Say, well, I can teach.  I can teach.  And so, I saw that as an arena where I could work with people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were a public school teacher for--
Speaker 2: All of four years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All of four years.
Story_ID: 228366
Speaker 1: And then what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, the National Science Foundation [NSF] was sponsoring what was called Academic Year Institutes for science and math teachers across the country; i.e., they wanted science and math teachers to have the latest techniques, the latest information to upgrade their skills.  And these Academic Year Institutes were sited at different major universities across the country.  They were one-year institutes.  I decided to apply.  And they had one at Harvard University [Cambridge, Massachusetts], and I was accepted, having taught four years of science in Newton [Massachusetts], into the Academic Year Institute at Harvard University from 1965, '66 [1966].  Many of the teachers across the country who got that year institute, wanted to start working on a master's degree or a doctorate degree.  I already had my master's.  So I was able to go to Harvard and take any course that I wanted to take across the Harvard University.  But, of course, I had to take more science.  I studied psychology under Jerome Bruner; cognitive sciences.  I took astronomy, I took earth science.  I took a course called the history of science, which I found fascinating.  So I had a full year of study at Harvard, and to take any courses that I wanted.  Didn't have to worry about grades, because I wasn't working for a certificate or a degree or anything.  So I went and did a full year at Harvard.  And a small stipend--my wife at the time, I got children, we didn't eat much but beans and franks because the stipend was less than what I was making as a teacher, although I was making a pretty good salary as a teacher.  But that was quite a break for me to get that academic year institute at Harvard University.  I was married at that time, I was a homeowner, and I had two children at that point.
Speaker 1: So what was so exciting about the Harvard experience?  I mean, who was there teaching?
Speaker 2: Well, there was a man by the name of Fletcher [G. Watson].  I can't remember his first name, but he was a well-known science educator.  He was an astronomer.  Can't remember his name.  Fletcher.  Jerome Bruner was there; the cognitive scientist was there.  E. O. Wilson [Edward O. Wilson].  Professor E. O. Wilson, one of the greatest scientists and animal behavior studies; I took a course with Wilson.  George Wald was there.  George Wald was a physiologist, extremely well-known antiwar professor.  So I studied under Wald, E. O. Wilson, Jerome Bruner; some of the leading people at Harvard at the time.  It was just a chance to study and improve my knowledge and skills and understanding of science and what science and technology was all about.  Okay.
Speaker 1: So this is like, '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Sixty-five [1965], '66 [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966].  Okay.
Speaker 2: Two full semesters.  Yep, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 228367
Speaker 1: Now, I hadn't asked you about this before, but during the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s], the Civil Rights Movement is kicking up, and there's a lot of activity around civil rights in the country; it's on the news.  Did you--I mean, what was your reaction to all of this?
Speaker 2: Well, in 1964--let's see, get all of this straight in my mind, now.  In 1964, we had boycotts of the Boston Public Schools [BPS] around the poor quality of education, particularly in the all-black or predominantly black schools.  And I do remember taking a day off from teaching at Newton [Massachusetts] to go into Boston [Massachusetts] to be a teacher for the day, because we were--well, let's say that Boston's black community, the parents, the churches, asked the students to stay out of school for a day or days to protest the poor quality of schools.  And so I went in as a Freedom School teacher.  I remember that.  The following year--was it '65 [1965]?  Yeah.  The following year, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] came and led a huge march in Boston about school desegregation.  Well, at that time, I was at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] doing my Academic Year Institute, and so I had the freedom to participate in the march and some of the activities around the school desegregation protests, and the Martin Luther King's presence, and so on.  So I was active on that front during '64 [1964] and '65 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you get a chance to meet Dr. King at that point?
Speaker 2: No.  In fact, I never did meet Dr. Martin Luther King.  But I did meet his wife, Coretta Scott King, on several occasions, well I can tell you about later as we move chronologically how that happened (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 228368
Speaker 1: Now had you started to develop any interest in African American history at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When I first started teaching at [John Wingate] Weeks Junior High School [Newton, Massachusetts], '61 [1961], '62 [1962], '63 [1963], I was concerned about the fact that there was nothing in the textbooks, nothing in the teaching training materials, about what African Americans had contributed to science, technology and medicine.  I knew about Charles [R.] Drew.  I knew about George Washington Carver.  I knew about Ernest Everett Just.  But that was the extent of my knowledge of black people in American science.  I started on my own to do my own study and research and just gathering materials, newspaper articles, little notations in encyclopedias about black people in science and started collecting that material.  Okay.  So that by the time I had finished my academic year institute at Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts]--and let me tell you that I did not go back to the classroom after I finished my year at Harvard.  I was supposed to under the National Science Foundation [NSF] grant that I got to be in there--I was supposed to go back to the classroom for four years.  Well, I read a newspaper ad where Xerox [Corporation] education division was looking for a science editor in Middletown, Connecticut.  If you remember the mid-'60s [1960s], [The] Raytheon [Company, Waltham, Massachusetts], IBM, Xerox, were buying up the publishing companies.  And Wesleyan University Press [Middletown, Connecticut] was putting out school newspapers in science and math and social studies, looking for a science editor; somebody who had a science teaching background.  Here I was with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry, a master's degree in science, four years of science teaching in a National Science Foundation Academic [Year] Institute; I said I want to be a science editor.  I want to write science.  Okay.  And I decided I was going to go to Connecticut, interview for the job.  And when I left Harvard in the summer of 1966, supposed to go back to teaching in September of '66 [1966], I moved to Middletown, Connecticut, as a science editor for the Xerox education division.  And I wrote for a paper called Science--what was it called Current Science.  It was a weekly science newspaper that went out to middle and high schools all across the country.
Speaker 1: What is it called again?
Speaker 2: It was called Current Science.
Speaker 1: Current Science.
Speaker 2: It was a weekly science newspaper that went out, like, forty weeks--weekly to science classrooms across the country.  It was a big sell-out. I mean, Western University Press had made big money off of their weekly--remember the [My] Weekly Reader when you went to school?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, that's where the Weekly Reader came from.  Xerox comes in and buys this publishing company.  They got a bunch of money.  So I walked into a great position as a science editor.  So now I had a chance to go back to my interest in writing.  I knew science, I knew what classrooms needed, I knew what teachers needed to teach science.  And every week we were putting out Current Science to the classrooms.  So I worked two years as a science editor in Middletown, Connecticut, for Xerox education division.  So at that point, I had left the classroom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What was beautiful, though, about being a science editor for Xerox education division.  Not only did I have a chance to write science every week and have that read by students and teachers in classrooms; of course, I wasn't the only science editor.  We probably had six people working on the newspaper.  Right.  Was that we had a chance to go out into the field and visit classrooms and visit school districts.  And that was an opportunity for me to go to, particularly, urban school districts.
Story_ID: 228369
Speaker 1: And what did you find in those districts?
Speaker 2: Well, we simply went out to see how the material was being used; to get critiques by the teachers; evaluations of our materials; get a better understanding about how science was being taught in various types of classrooms, urban and suburban, so that we could then develop a more effective Current Science newspaper.  We also had a high school newspaper called Science and Math Weekly [ph.].  I also got a chance to write for the high school readership, and that was all of two years.  At the end of 1968, Xerox [Corporation] education division purchased Ginn & Company in Boston [Massachusetts], one of the old traditional publishers.  I didn't like Connecticut.  I moved my family there, we lived there for two years.  I was still going back and forth from Middletown, Connecticut, to Boston.  I said I want to go back to Boston.  I was able to engineer myself a transfer.  Stayed within Xerox education division, but went to work for Ginn & Company in Boston.  And that was in 1968.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1968.  All right.  Now, this is sort of--so what did you do, the same kind of thing at Ginn & Company?
Speaker 2: Well, at Ginn & Company, Xerox had pumped in millions of dollars to develop a brand-new K [kindergarten] to eight science textbook curriculum.  They had hired scientists, like Isaac Asimov and Roy [A.] Gallant and Jeanne Bendick to write the science.  They had hired psychologists.  They had hired curricular people to put this huge textbook program together.  And I became a science editor in this elementary school series.  And one of the writers that I worked with was the famous science fiction writer, Isaac Asimov.  And so that was a great experience.  So, I, you know--I was helping to develop science textbooks, doing the rewriting, doing the editing, getting the illustrations, and field testing.  Remember I said that Xerox had money to put the editors out in the field.  I went to Montreal, Canada; I went to Detroit [Michigan]; I went to New Orleans [Louisiana] where they were field testing these--they weren't just writing stuff and selling it.  They were field testing the material.  So I had a chance to go out and visit school systems during that time during that one year.
Story_ID: 228370
Speaker 1: Do you still have this interest in African American history during this period of time, and how is that--where is that at this point?
Speaker 2: Well, I had applied for a doctoral degree program at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] when I was living in Connecticut.  I was accepted into an Ed.D. program.  And I was going to use all the materials that I had collected on blacks in science, math and technology and so on for my thesis.  But I could see that the professor that I had at the time as my mentor, was going to take that stuff.  And often professors will encumber and, you know, massage and take over what their students had worked on.  And I was a little leery of, you know, how he was going to take my material.  Nobody else had done this kind of research.  A couple other guys had begun to do some work in blacks in science.  One of the persons I worked with at Xerox [Corporation] education division, Ray Brockell [ph.], Raymond Brockell, had left Xerox and went to Addison-Wesley to develop a new trade book division.  He came back one day looking for editors who wanted to get books published.  And I told him that I had all this material on blacks in science and technology and so on. He said, "That's something we'd be"--now, this is late 1960s.  Right?  I had already come back to Boston [Massachusetts].  And he said, "Write me a proposal.  Send me a table of contents."  So I put together a table of contents of twenty-five African Americans in science, technology and medicine; and I wrote a sample chapter, and I sent it in.  And, of course, in those days, black stuff was in vogue.  Black studies materials were needed, particularly in the science area.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  It was starting to blossom, you know, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so Ray Brockell comes back to me.  He'd taken it back to his staff, editorial board.  He comes back, he says, "We've decided you have three books.  We'd like you to do a book on blacks in science," which I have right here.  Then he says, "The second book will be blacks in technology in the field of invention."  And then he said, "We'll do a third book, blacks in medicine."  Well, to make a long story short, Larry [Crowe], my first hardback came out in 1970 by Addison-Wesley, 'Seven Black American Scientists' [Robert C. Hayden] the book that you see here on the table.  Two years later, 1972, my second hardback came out, 'Eight Black American Inventors' [Robert C. Hayden].  And then four years later, there was a little delay, my third hardback and my third book, 'Nine Black American Doctors' [Robert C. Hayden].  So in the course of six years, I had three books out.  That put me out there in science education as a historian of blacks in science.  Now there were two other guys who had come out with books, both white researchers, white authors had come out with books.  So I was on the forefront.  One of the pioneers to have stuff first published in hardback.  And, of course, the school districts across the country and libraries bought my books.
Story_ID: 228371
Speaker 1: Tell us about the contents of these books and where you did your research?  And how did you find out about all these black scientists?  I mean they're not--I think that's the subject of blacks in science is probably the--if you ask most black people to name a black scientist, they'd probably be tongue tied or most people, so--
Speaker 2: Well, most of the black scientists in the very first book ['Seven Black American Scientists,' Robert C. Hayden], certainly their names and a little objective straightforward information was available on them; where they went to college, where they taught, the articles they may have published, the nature of their research.  But it was pretty skimpish, pretty straightforward. I felt that my books could be and were different, because having a science background and understand biology, chemistry and physics and the relationship between those three sciences, this is a (unclear) approach to science, that I could explain not just about the lives that these people led and what influenced them to go into science, and the obstacles that they had to overcome to be an accomplished scientist.  But I could also explain the science.  I could also teach the science.  Okay.  'Cause I knew science.  So these chapters are not just biographical.  But they also will teach you some very basic elementary science.  If you don't understand how cells function, if you don't understand something about geography and climate and so on, and weather and the physical science of weather, you can read the chapter on Matthew Henson.  Okay.  And so we talk about the physical conditions that he confronted going to the North Pole and how you measure, how you measure where you are on the Earth.  How did he know that he reached the geographic North Pole?  You know, the kids learn about latitude and longitude, but I actually talk about that in there.  You've all heard about Benjamin Banneker.  Right?  And that he invented a clock. Well, he didn't invent a clock.  He built a clock.  Okay.  And it worked.  It was a working clock.  But the important work he did were astronomical observations.  Now Banneker didn't make any new observations.  Okay.  But he did calculations and recalculations so that he could predict eclipses, phases of the moon.  And most people don't know what's that all about, "Well, how do you do that?"  Well, I explain that in there, because I have the science background.  I did my research primarily by writing to colleges and universities that could supply me with the bibliographies of the published works of many of the scientists.  I then went and got their papers and read some of the papers, 'cause I could understand them.  I could see the honors and awards that they received, and what they were being recognized for.  And so that's how I put it together.  Now where I could, I tried to interview relatives, family friends, former colleagues of the people.  Okay.  So even beyond these three books, I've done a lot of interviewing of relatives, friends and colleagues of many of the people that I've written about in science, technology and medicine, and outside of medicine.
Story_ID: 228372
Speaker 1: I'll tell you one story, I know you like to hear stories.  Dr. Charles Henry Turner, Ph.D. in biology from 1908, from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois]; his specialty as a biologist was insect behavior.  Behavior of ants, bees and wasps.  All right.  Turner was mentioned briefly.  You'll see his name, he went to the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] for an undergraduate degree; master's degree, University of Chicago; published forty-nine articles in the Biological Bulletin, the official journal of the research initiatives here at the Woods Hole [Marine Biological Laboratory, Woods Hole, Massachusetts].  Okay.  When I finished that book ['Seven Black American Scientists,' Robert C. Hayden], Larry [Crowe], I did have enough material on Charles Henry Turner to write a chapter that would be comparable to the other chapters.  Right.  It was simple.  So I told my editor about it, Ray Broco [ph.], and he said, "Why don't you just list Dr. Turner at the back and we'll make a list of other people.  Just put--," that doesn't appeal to me, just listing.  I said, "Let me do some more work on Turner."  Charles Henry Turner, when he got the Ph.D. in biology, went to [Charles H.] Sumner High School, St. Louis, Missouri, to teach biology.  Okay. I said, why don't I write to Sumner High School?  Now, I'm working here in Boston [Massachusetts], you know, I've hadn't travel much; didn't have any money.  I wrote--I went to the Boston Public Library [BPL], got out a directory that I knew existed that listed high school principals in the country; went to Missouri, went to St. Louis, found Sumner High School, went over to the right-hand column, blank; no principals name for Sumner High.  I mean, all the other schools have principals.  No principals name.  I wrote, "Dear Principal, Sumner High School.  I am so and so, this is what I'm doing.  Do you have any material in the high school archives, anything you can help me to know more about Dr. Charles Henry Turner?"  Right.  I had no idea where family was, if there was family, I mean the guy died in 1923.  Right.  Three weeks later, I get this big envelope in the mail, big huge writing, "Important.  Urgent."  It was a letter from Ms. Julia Davis, whose son [John Davis Buckner] was the principal of the high school.  And he knew that his mother had studied under Dr. Charles Henry Turner when she was preparing to be a teacher in St. Louis.  And she took biology with him.  So this lady, she's very proper, Negro woman, a champion of black history, was excited that somebody was interested in her former favorite teacher.  And she says, "I'm willing to help you, but first you must tell me who you are."  So I wrote her this long letter, typed it up, told her who I was, why I needed the information.  She sent me a letter back, and that started three or four or five years of correspondence with Ms. Julia Davis, who put me in touch with a grandson of Dr. Charles Henry Turner, the late Darwin T. Turner; one of the best known African American--this is his grandfather.  So I get in touch with Darwin T. Turner.  Darwin is out at Iowa State [University of Science and Technology, Ames, Iowa] on sabbatical.  He says, "When I get back to St. Louis," he said, "maybe I can send you a souvenir booklet that was done when my father died."  I said, "I can't wait, Dr. Turner," I wrote him.  I said, "I got to get this chapter written.  Can't you get me a copy of it," well anyways, I got a copy of the souvenir booklet.  It talked about Dr. Turner the man; Dr. Turner the teacher, Dr. Turner the scientist.  So here I have a lot more information, testimony about his grandfather, Charles Henry Turner.
Speaker 2: Now, Darwin Turner, he's a--he's more of a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Literature.  African American literature.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 228373
Speaker 1: --In one of his [Darwin T. Turner] letters, right, he says, "I notice you're in Boston [Massachusetts]."  Now, this was the second or third letter he had sent to me in Boston, but he said, "I notice you're in Boston."  He said, "I have a brother who lives in Boston.  His name is [HistoryMaker Charles] "Chuck" Turner."  I said, "Oh, my God."  Here's another grandson living right in my city.  I knew Chuck.  Right.  I picked up the phone.  I'm working for Ginn & Company [Boston, Massachusetts].  Remember Xerox [Corporation] education--I pick up the phone.  Right.  "Chuck, I got to come see you."  I go up to the [National] Black United Front in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] where Chuck was the director.  I said, "I am researching your grandfather [Dr. Charles Henry Turner]."  Okay.  He then puts me in touch with his father [Darwin R. Turner], Dr. Charles Henry Turner's son, Darwin's father, who's a semi-retired pharmacist in Chicago [Illinois].  I go to Chicago to meet with the last surviving child of Dr. Turner.  Right.  When I called him from Boston, he says, "Well, I don't know."  He said, "You know, I work after--I got to work Saturday morning in the drugstore."  He lived above a drugstore in Chicago.  "And my girlfriend's coming over Friday."  And I want to go to Chicago and talk to the son of this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this is the son of Charles Henry Turner?
Speaker 1: Yes.  This is Darwin and Chuck Turner's father.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, I get to Chicago, I get to the corner or whatever on the South Side of Chicago.  It was a Saturday morning, he was going to work at eleven.  I got to his apartment at eight.  I spent two hours with the man.  He was living, Larry [Crowe], in a room no bigger than this with a little gas stove and a little refrigerator.  He was a semi-retired pharmacist.  I interviewed him about his father.  I said, "You have any pictures?"  He didn't have any pictures.  You know what he did have?  He had a photocopy of a letter that his father, Dr. Charles Henry Turner, had written to Booker T. Washington when he finished his master's degree at University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio], asking for a job at Tuskegee [Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Well, it's in the book ['Seven Black American Scientists,' Robert C. Hayden].  That letter that he has is in the book.  You asked me how I did the--I mean, it's just one example.  In terms of Garrett Morgan [Sr.] and the three-way traffic signal, he had a son living in--I think it was Chicago--yeah, it was Chicago--or Cleveland [Ohio] at the time.
Speaker 2: Cleveland.
Speaker 1: I simply went to the telephone book, looked up Garrett Morgan, Jr., wrote him a letter, and the man sent me an envelope with all these artifacts and materials on his father, Garrett Morgan.  And in that book on inventors ['Eight Black American Inventors,' Robert C. Hayden], you will see some of the original diagrams and sketches that Garrett Morgan used to market his gas mask.  Remember he invented the gas mask?  And the three-way traffic signal.  So it was by correspondence to relatives, to friends--in this case, Ms. Julia Davis.  And Ms. Julia Davis, if I could go back for just a minute, was a champion of quote Negro history, as she called it, in St. Louis [Missouri] for over forty years.  She was a public school teacher.  So she just loved what I was doing, you know.  So those are just two stories of how I, you know, just did some research, got in touch with people and met people and got materials to come to me.  And I could tell you many, many other stories.
Story_ID: 228374
Speaker 1: Had you read like works of some of the other, the early black historians that wrote about some of the inventors?  I know J. A. Rogers did write about Norbert Rillieux and--if I'm pronouncing his name right, and Garrett Morgan [Sr.] and some of the other people.  But he was about the--he and I think, Dr. [Ellen] Irene Diggs did a little bit of research on black inventors, too.  And there may be a few others.  But did any of that work--did you get clues from some of that work, or--
Speaker 2: Well, can I back up just a minute?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: The first book ['Seven Black American Scientists,' Robert C. Hayden] came out in 1970.  I'd been working on it while I was at Xerox [Corporation] education division in Boston [Massachusetts].  Okay.  I only stayed a year with Xerox education division, Ginn & Company [Boston, Massachusetts] that I mentioned earlier.  I really felt that my place was working in the community, working with people.  Being a textbook editor and working with a small cadre of other editors and writers was great.  I made good money working for Xerox.  I got some nice perks and nice benefits.  But, you know, here we are at the end--well, not maybe at end of the Civil Rights Movement of the '60s [1960s], turmoil in the cities; I really wanted to get out there and work, doing--work in the cities.  I had already done volunteer work in Hartford, Connecticut, in my spare time.  I had done work--once I got back to Boston, I got involved in Boston's black community.  Okay.  And a position opened up as the executive director of the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity [(METCO), Boston, Massachusetts].  That position opened up in the fall of 1969.  In 1966, the program, it is known as METCO, M-E-T-C-O, started enrolling and transferring by bus--I don't like to call it a busing program--219 black students to twenty-two suburban school districts.  It was a program to give those black children and teenagers in Boston a chance at a better education by going to suburban schools.  By the time I came back to Boston in 1969, the program was three years old.  And its founder and director was ready to move on.  I applied for that job.  Had a board of directors of twenty-eight people, public and private people, black and white.  It had been funded by Carnegie [Foundation], the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and the federal government for three years.  It is moving black children to suburbs.  All that public and foundation money had run out.  And the director who had been there said, "I don't want to face going on to state money, public money."  And she--it was a hard job.  I applied and I got the job.  Now, I had been out of Boston essentially for three years, except my volunteer work when I went back in 1969.  I became the director of the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity.
Story_ID: 228375
Speaker 1: When I left [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO), Boston, Massachusetts] in 1973, I had 1800 students riding seventy-seven buses every day to thirty-two suburban school districts.  I was working ten days a week, six weeks a month.  I mean, it was like running the school system.  It was bigger than running a school system.  I had to work from all the way from the bus drivers and the bus companies, who were on parent groups, to the state legislature, to the Boston [Massachusetts] school system; and I had to work with all of the suburban school districts, twenty-eight of them, where we had anywhere from nine to twelve to twenty to maybe thirty-six black students in these various school districts going back and forth every day.  It was--and it was--the program was based in the community.  It was started by black parents.  In the very year that I left Boston to go to Connecticut to work with Xerox [Corporation], black parents said, "We've had enough of the Boston [Public] Schools [BPS].  We're going to find relief."  Legislation got passed.  [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] had helped Massachusetts' legislature [Massachusetts General Court] to pass the racial imbalance law [Racial Imbalance Act of 1966] in Massachusetts on his second march through Boston in 1965 that I participated in.  And out of that racial imbalance law came an amendment that made it possible for black students to go to schools outside their district.  It was their choice.  It was a voluntary program.  It was voluntary on the part of the suburban district to accept black students from the City of Boston.  So I directed that program.  I had a staff of eight or nine people.  We had parent meetings every night.  I mean, I had to raise money.  I had to work for the State Department of Education [Massachusetts Department of Elementary & Secondary Education].  It was a tremendous job.
Story_ID: 228376
Speaker 1: Now getting back to answer your question about was I starting to study black history--read black history.  I said, as a director of METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts], I'm not going to send black students out to these suburban districts [of Boston, Massachusetts] unless they start changing the curriculum.  We've got to start putting black and ethnic kids--so one of the things I wanted to do as the director of METCO, was to have an impact on curriculum.  And I said, "You got the students out there, then you're going to have to train the teachers and have the appropriate materials, not just for the black students who are out in these all-white classrooms, but the white kids need it, too."  So what did I do, Larry [Crowe]?  I joined and went to the first, my first, annual meeting of the Association for the Study of African American Life & History [ASALH] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I had some money in my budget, I was the director of the program. I said, this is part of my PD [public domain], but I want to find out what's going--you're not going on African American history.  That's when I became a member of the Association.
Speaker 2: That was 1970 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Nineteen seventy [1970].
Speaker 2: Seventy [1970].
Speaker 1: (Unclear) in the fall of 1970 was my first meeting with the Association of African American Life & History.  And I didn't know any of the black historians.  I knew them by name.  I, of course, I read [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin's 'From Slavery to Freedom[: A History of African Americans'].  Right.  I had heard of Charles [H.] Wesley.  But I went out there.  Okay.  A Young Turk, a young guy who never even majored in history.  I'm in science education, running a community ed [education] program.  But I knew that I wanted to learn more about--now these books also stimulated my interest in a broad field of African American history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but, you know, you realize that what you'd done by writing these books is that you'd done something that a lot of the people at the conferences hadn't done.  I mean, you, in the terms (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Well, in my field, yes.
Speaker 2: --of the detail and the research, I mean, what you're talking about is primary research.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You talk to people who actually knew people and collected original materials.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I mean, that's just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now, it might feel, I was kind of the breakthrough guy. Now, when I go to these meetings, right, it was very difficult for the young black historians to get inside of the Association at that time.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's pretty--
Speaker 1: Darlene Clark Hine, Bob Harris [HistoryMaker Robert Lee Harris, Jr.]--oh, I can't think of the names now, but the black historians that are still out there today.
Speaker 2: They were young men then.
Speaker 1: They were. And I was young--
Speaker 2: And had afros (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but--yeah.  But they were historians.  I was an educator.
Story_ID: 228377
Speaker 1: But I went out, and I kept going to the meetings [Association for the Study of African American Life & History (ASALH)] every year.  I'd get the books.  I'd get The Journal of Negro History, I met Charles [H.] Wesley.  I met [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin.  I met Rayford [W.] Logan, Lorenzo Greene, Ewart Guinier, and these guys took an interest in me.  They knew I was a back--what I call some, backdoor historian.  They knew I was a backdoor historian.  But they encouraged me.  They had seen my work.  And they encouraged me to keep on going.  And so I've been to the associated meeting every year since 1970.  Well, that helped me with my METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts] work, 'cause I had resources, materials.  I knew what was going on in black studies, particularly at the high school level, through the Association.  As you know, the Association started Black History Month, Negro History Week in 1927.  It's the Association that puts out, still, every year the Black History Month kit.  So I bought the kits back.  I made the suburban school system [Boston, Massachusetts] buy the kits and get the teachers to use those kits.  So that was my reason for going to the Association.  But that's where I learned my history.  That was my doctoral work in history.  I am still a member of the Association.  And today I am the national secretary of the Association--African American Life and History.  I've been for the last six or eight years.  Got on the board in the '80s [1980s], and I founded a branch of the Association here on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 228378
Speaker 1: In 1974, I asked Mel Miller [HistoryMaker Melvin Miller], founder and publisher of the Bay State Banner newspaper in Boston [Massachusetts], a black newspaper.  I had known Mel.  I said, "Mel, you ought to have some black history in your newspaper.  Got to have something in the newspaper about black history for everybody to read."  He says, "Well, you write it, I'll print it."  He says, "Give me five articles upfront."  Okay.  I picked out five people I was going to write about, and the very first person I selected was the person from my book ['Eight Black American Inventors,' Robert C. Hayden] on black inventors, Lewis [Howard] Latimer, who worked with Thomas Edison on the electric light bulb.  I wrote the article on Lewis Latimer based on my chapter for the Bay State Banner, 250 words a column, "Boston's Black History."  In doing the research on Lewis Latimer, I found out that his father George Latimer had been the center of a very famous fugitive slave case in Boston in 1850.  And then I was exposed to the African meeting house, abolitionism in Boston, the anti-slavery movement, and all of the blacks and whites who were working against slavery; and that stimulated my interest in Boston's black history.  Larry [Crowe], I ended up writing a weekly column in the Bay State Banner from 1974 until 1983.  Every week I had a--column on a different person, place and event.  So all through the '70s [1970s], I was writing popular black history for the Banner, doing a lot of teacher training across the country around my books for science teachers, the integration of this material into science and math classrooms.  So I just spinned that out for you.
Story_ID: 228379
Speaker 1: Now, in 1978, Holly [M.] Carter, Holly Carter, C-A-R-T-E-R, was the temporary chairperson of the Department of Afro-American Studies [Department of Cultures, Societies and Global Studies] at Northeastern University [Boston, Massachusetts].  And she asked me to come to Northeastern and to design and teach a new course for Afro studies, the history of blacks in science, technology and medicine, 'cause I had the three books out.  And that was my introduction to college and teaching at Northeastern University.  And I just retired from Northeastern about three years ago with the rank of senior lecturer.  And only one of all those years that I was at Northeastern was I there full-time.  One year I had a visiting professorship. Northeastern carried me as a part-time instructor all those years.  Okay.  From there, I started teaching at Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], Curry College [Milton, Massachusetts], Lesley College [Lesley University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And in 1992, when I retired from my thirty-two years of work in public education, which I haven't told you about yet, I was asked to come to the University of Massachusetts, Boston [(UMass Boston), Boston, Massachusetts], to teach one course, and then two.  And I've been at University of Massachusetts, Boston since 1992.  I've given up my teaching at all the other colleges.  At one time I was teaching at four colleges at the same time.  But I gradually released myself from those, but I keep the UMass, the UMass appointment. So I've had, in the last ten, twelve years, a tremendous career as a college instructor, as a lecturer.  I never got my Ph.D.  You can ask me about that later.  I never got my Ph.D.  Okay.  But I've done everything that I've ever wanted to do.  As far as a researcher, I'm a writer, publisher, and a college teacher in the greater Boston [Massachusetts] area.  The other thing I'm very proud of is that in 1994, '95 [1995], I received a scholar-in-residency at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York City [New York, New York].  I was one of the scholars-in-residence at the Schomburg.  And up until that time, Larry [Crowe], I'm quite sure, and that program had been going on at least since 1988, I was the only one up until that time, and the only one in that class of scholars, that didn't have a Ph.D (laughter).  I never got the Ph.D.  It never bothered me, you know.
Story_ID: 228380
Speaker 1: If you ask me about a highlight of my life, one of the big highlights, it was to be able to go to the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] for a year and just research the life of Dr. Louis Tompkins Wright, which resulted, of course, in my biography, '"Mr. Harlem Hospital" [Dr. Louis T. Wright: A Biography,' Robert C. Hayden]. So that was a great year for me.
Speaker 2: It must have been interesting, because Harlem Hospital [Center, New York, New York] is right across the street.  That neighborhood is so--around the Schomburg, it's so rich in history.
Speaker 1: Well, I lived on St. Nicholas Avenue [Harlem, New York, New York].  I mean, I lived in New York full time for nine months.  Interviewed over eighty people for this book; former nurses, patients, colleagues of Dr. Wright; people who knew Dr. Wright.  I mean, I just, you know, that's all I did.  And people look at me and say, "How could you spend a whole year just researching one guy's life?"  I said, "Well, you know, when you do eighty interviews, it takes a whole day just to get in your car and get out to New Rochelle [New York] or get to Queens [New York, New York] or get to Brooklyn [New York, New York].  I had to go up to Long Island [New York], you know, to interview the sons and the daughters of some of these doctors.  That's a whole day by the time you drive out and come back and listen to the--you know.  And that's just the oral history part.  But that was a great year for me.  That was a great year being at the Schomburg.
Speaker 2: That really does sound like a great year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 228381
Speaker 1: Is there a story about doing that research about Dr. [Louis Tompkins] Wright that you can tell us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Let's see.  How can I get into this?  When I was growing up and going to my grandmother's [Fannie Hughes] house that I mentioned an hour ago to you, going to my grandmother's house in the summer.  My grandparents and the other people in her generation and my mother's [Josephine Hughes Hayden] friends would always come over and they'd sit on the stoop outside and they would talk about people and who's where and who's doing what, you know, what's happened to so and so.  And as a youngster, I would always used to hear my grandparents and my mother talking about Tommy Patrick, Mr. and Mrs. Patrick, Charlotte [ph.] Patrick, Dr. Thomas [W.] Patrick [Jr.].  And I actually learned that one of my mother's boyhood friends that she grew up with in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] was a doctor in New York [New York].  And that was far--as a ten--nine or ten-year-old, and I mean, you know, New York was way off.  But I grew up hearing this name Patrick.  Okay.  I became a teenager, went to college [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], my grandmother passed; all that kind of just faded.  I didn't think any more about the name Patrick.  I drive from Boston to New York City on a hot summer day in August of 1975 to interview Dr. George [D.] Cannon about another black doctor in Harlem [New York, New York] for this book ['Nine Black American Doctors,' Robert C. Hayden].  And I said to Dr. Cannon, "What was it like coming to Harlem in the [Great] Depression, 1931, and trying to open a practice here?"  And one of the things he told me was, "You know, there were a lot of us here, black doctors." And he said, "We didn't--weren't able to afford the medical journals.  We couldn't join the libraries here.  We weren't on the hospital staffs.  And so we had our own readers' group.  We read the articles and we met every month and we shared them with each other."  And he started ticking off the names of these black doctors who were in the group.
Story_ID: 228382
Speaker 1: When I got out of my car that morning to go to Dr. [George D.] Cannon's office, I got out of my car, closed the door.  I'm standing on the sidewalk, West 138th Street [New York, New York], and I look up and here's this sign, Dr. Thomas W. Patrick, Jr., M.D.  And I had this flashback to my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden].  Boston [Massachusetts], Tommy Patrick.  This got to be the guy my mother used to talk about.  Right?  I go to Dr. Cannon's office, do the interview.  When he starts to tell me the names of the doctors, right, who were part of this readers' group, he mentioned Dr. Patrick.  I stopped him.  I said, "You mentioned a Dr. Patrick.  Is that the doctor about two doors up?"  He say, "Yeah."  I said, "Do you know if he was from Boston originally?"  Dr. Cannon says, "I think the young chap, I think he was from Boston."  I had another interview at one o'clock.  I finished that interview at eleven.  I said, "I'm going to go in and see if this Dr. Patrick is my mother's boyhood friend, family friend from Boston."  I walk in-- he's a pediatrician.  He's got a room twice this size.  Baby stalls all around.  Babies crying, nurses running back.  I walk in with a briefcase.  "Is Dr. Patrick in?"  "No.  What do you want?"  I said, "Well, I'd like--,"  "Well, have a seat."  I backed up and sat.  He hadn't come in yet.  Ten minutes later, this gentleman--I don't know what he looks like--this gentleman walks in, about your complexion.  He goes into the back office.  I said that must be Dr. Patrick.  I said they're not going to tell him I'm sitting out.  I was the only man there with a suit with this briefcase.  All the mothers were in there with their babies, having their anal temperatures taken, all that kind of stuff.  He comes back out--this gentleman comes back out.  He walks across the waiting room, and he--like he's walking toward me.  He's not looking up at me.  He doesn't see me.  And he goes right by me.  He's going back out.  I jump out of my seat, I say, "Dr. Patrick?"  And he looks, he says, "Yes?"  And I proceeded to try to introduce--he says, "Come on out here on the sidewalk with me."  Kind of grabs my arm.  Probably thought I was selling medicines or something, a salesman.  And it was three steps up to the sidewalk.  So I follow him up and we get out to the sidewalk.  And I introduced myself again, and I said, "I think that you may have known and grew up with my mother."  I said, "You're from Boston?"  He says, "Yeah."  I said, "Well my mother was Josephine Hughes, and I'm her son."  And he looks at me, "You're Josephine's son?"  Now, they hadn't seen each other in forty years.  He throws his arms around me.  Says, "Come on.  Help me get these things out of the car." He's got a little Jeep.  We walk right--he's a magazines and newspapers that he has to get in to the doctor's office for his people to read.  I carried these things in.  He takes me in the back office.  Immediately--doesn't look at a baby.  Doesn't--takes me in his back office, sits me down, space like this, right.  I proceeded to tell him I'm working on a book on blacks in medicine ['Nine Black American Doctors,' Robert C. Hayden] that I just interviewed Dr. Cannon, and at one o'clock I'm going to interview doctor--I can't remember his name.  Dr. Patrick proceeds open up this fat briefcase and pull all these materials out on his father, Dr. Thomas W. Patrick, Sr., who was a pharmacist in Boston for over thirty years.  His father had been born in Trinidad.  I'm sorry.  In Haiti.  Trained in Trinidad in pharmacy under the British system, and had come to Boston in 1893 and opened up the Patrick School of Pharmacy [Boston, Massachusetts], just around the time that my grandparents came, the Hughes [Fannie Hughes and Joseph Hughes].  So the Hughes, my grandparents, and the Patricks were like this.  And they had children, my mother had a brother.  So I revived the whole Patrick pharmacy story.  What question am I answering now?  You were asking me about special experiences?
Speaker 2: Yeah about--in research.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, I went down to research the life of [Dr.] Arthur Logan of New York City, went to talk to Dr. Cannon, ended up meeting Dr. Thomas W. Patrick.  Okay.  I mean, you talk about fate.  On that August morning, I think it was August 15th of 1975, if I had parked my car three doors down from Cannon's office, or if I had parked my car across the street on the right-hand side, I probably never would have seen that sign, Dr. Thomas W. Patrick.  We became very, very, very--he passed about eight years ago.  But he and my mother were able to get together after forty years.  Even though my mother was here in New Bedford [Massachusetts], he was a New Yorker and he never left New York, he never came back to Boston, right, they got together after forty years.  I never would have met him if I hadn't parked my car where I parked it.  How do you figure that happened?  I don't know.
Story_ID: 228383
Speaker 1: Dr. Thomas W. Patrick [Jr.] and I, of course, became very close friends over the years. And he invited me to a Fourth of July picnic that he was holding at his home out in Hastings-on-Hudson [New York], north of New York City [New York, New York].  And when I arrived with my girlfriend at the time, there were perhaps twelve to fifteen people assembled outdoors in the picnic area, and we had started to have our cocktail and maybe a hamburger or something.  And I heard Tommy say, "Oh, here comes Booker."
Speaker 2: (INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: I remember Tommy looking up and I was perhaps three or four feet from him.  I remember Tom Patrick looking.  "Oh, here comes Booker and Joyce [ph.]."  And he was just announcing it to the people who were there.  And coming down the flagstone walk were a gentleman and his wife.  And as they were closer, I looked at him--
Speaker 2: (INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 1: --I looked at this gentleman and I said, "He looks just like Booker T. Washington."  Well, the picnic went on and he and his wife, you know, got mixing in with the crowd.  And eventually, I get close to him or we were kind of introduced or whatever.  And I had to ask the question.  I said, "Were you related to Booker T. Washington?"  He said, "I'm his grandson, Booker T. Washington III," who lived on West 138th Street, right where the doctors, Striver's Row [New York, New York].  Right.  So I got to know Booker, and he became interested in what I was doing.  And the reason he was interested in what I was doing as a historian and what I had done, he was trying to write the biography of his grandfather.  He said, "Nobody got it right."  He wanted me to come and help him.  So I became friends with Booker T. Washington III.  When I go to the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] for my fellowship, my scholar-in-residence, I'm looking for a place to live.  So I go down to New York, you know, in the spring, starting to fear where am I going to find a room or apartment.  I go by to see Booker.  Right.  He introduces me to the Wallaces, Mr. and Mrs.--I think it's James Wallace [ph.], who at that point, owned the home and the office that was owned and lived in by [Dr.] Louis Tompkins Wright [Louis T. Wright] and his family.  So he's three or four--so I meet the Wallaces and I'm coming to do Louis Wright's story, biography ['"Mr. Harlem Hospital" Dr. Louis T. Wright: A Biography,' Robert C. Hayden].  And so they gave me a tour of the Wright homestead.  Took me up, showed me the bedrooms where his daughters lived, where his office was, the changes that had been made in the brownstone and so on.  And one thing led to another that I was looking for a place to live.  And Mr. Wallace was saying, the two bedrooms on the third floor were empty.  His daughters were gone.  They were either in college or married and they had left home.  Right.  And so, the point was, well, gee, I need a place to stay.  Here were some bedrooms.  You can stay here.  I said here is fate again.  You mean to tell me I have a chance to live for a live as a scholar in the former home of Dr. Louis Tompkins Wright, my subject?  Well, we found out the next fifteen minutes of discussion that Mr. Wallace thought I was only coming like for a month or two months.  He didn't know I was going to be there all year.  And he said, "Well," he said, "I'd love to have you, but my daughters are in and out, Thanksgiving, Christmas, you know."  But he thought, well, for the time, for the short period of time, I could stay in that house, you know.  So I almost ended up living there.  But that's kind of the tail end of the story.
Story_ID: 228384
Speaker 1: I went to the funeral of Booker T. Washington III, and the person--I was living on St. Nicholas Avenue [New York, New York], I was at the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], and I always thought, well this is my year to get to know Booker T. Washington III, because I can live there.  Before, I was in Boston [Massachusetts], so I couldn't spend much time with him.  He had always wanted me to come and help him with getting the story right about his grandfather [Booker T. Washington].  And--but anyways, he died that year.  I think it was the winter, as I remember.  And I, of course, went over to interview [Dr.] John Henrik Clarke for my research.  Right.  And then Booker died.  John Henrik Clarke was blind at that point.  You know, he died blind.  So he said, "You're going to take me to Booker's memorial service."  So I went to John Henrik Clarke's house that morning, and we walked from his house on West 137th Street to the Schomburg for that memorial service.  And then we walked back.  He said, "I'm taking you to breakfast."  And we had breakfast together.  I had met John Henrik (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Where did he take you to Pan Pan [Restaurant, New York, New York] or--
Speaker 1: No.  We didn't go to Pan Pan.  We went to another place very similar, closer to his home.  Yeah.  I love--I used to eat at Pan Pan all the time.  I met John Henrik Clarke through the Association [for the Study] of African American Life & History [ASAALH].  I went to Africa in 1993, to Ghana for the seventeenth annual meeting of the International Council for Black Studies [sic. National Council for Black Studies], and Clarke was with us.  So I got to know him in Ghana, and he was blind then, as I remember.  So I've had some tremendous opportunities to know and be with, and in many cases write about some of the giants, some of the great minds in African American studies, African American history.  But my times with John Henrik Clarke, I'll never forget.  Just the two of us walking to that memorial and walking him back home.  I remember the morning that I went to interview him.  This was before.  He told me to arrive at nine o'clock.  And he answered the door himself, blind.  And he had fixed his own breakfast of sausage, toast and I guess it was coffee.  And he had already brought it in on the dining room table.  And he said, "Now, I have to finish my"--, I said, "Dr. Clarke, take (unclear)."  "Can I have my breakfast first?"  He was blind, but he was fixing his own breakfast.  And then he pushed it aside and he sat there and he (unclear) a two-hour interview with John Henrik Clarke.  And, of course, he knew Dr. Louis [T.] Wright and told me some great stories about his going to meet Dr. Wright in Dr. Wright's medical office, which I won't get into.  But I just had some tremendous opportunities.
Speaker 2: Is that when he was living in, like, the basement of the brownstone there, or was he in a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, his library was in the basement from front to back, from floor to ceiling.  If you ever--did you ever go in?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You know the library.  Then upstairs, it was his kitchen, I think in the back.  And a dining room with a big dining room table, and another front room.  And then I guess he had sleeping quarters upstairs.  He did have an assistant, because she did come in after we had started the interview, 'cause he had told me she would be there.  But he answered the door and had already fixed his breakfast before she got there.
Story_ID: 228385
Speaker 1: Well, you know, [Dr.] John [Henrik] Clarke is important.  I don't think we've had many people mention him, but talk about his significance to the whole Harlem [New York, New York] scene.  Can you just kind of briefly tell us what--
Speaker 2: Well, I think that John Henrik Clarke, as I've read about his life, and as he's told me a little bit about it, and told others in larger groups that I was in, perhaps at this Association [for the Study of African American Life & History (ASALH)] meeting, was that he was not trained as a historian.  He was just deeply interested in his African roots and Africa and the truth.  And he went about doing his own reading, his own self-education.  And then when he got to Harlem coming out of World War II [WWII], I believe, he started to volunteer as a teacher of--I don't know what we called them, we didn't call them black studies then--but he taught at the Y [Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)], taught at a couple of community centers, and he continued--and he was such an effective presenter of material, and he mastered the material and was able to interpret it and present it in such a way that, you know, he became--everybody was drawn to him.  And, of course, he was then asked to teach at the college level.  I don't know where he first started teaching, but he was at Hunter College [New York, New York] as you know as head of Africana and then Puerto Rican studies.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I think the importance of Clarke is to show that you can become a scholar and a published scholar and a solid researcher without a lot of training, if that's what you want to do.  And I suppose (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, without formal training, I guess, because he would have said without formal training, as such.  But, you know, he had--he talked about, you know, his relation with Arthur Schomburg [Arturo Alfonso Schomburg], you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I think he came to Harlem in 1930, and they had something called the Harlem History Club.  This was prior to the war.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, of course, he went off to the war.  When he came back, he got, you know, he got even more deeply involved in the history aspect of it.  But, you know, he goes all the way back to, his links go way back to the 19th century--in terms history.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  He's saying that our history, going back to Africa, has to become part of our community life and our community thinking.  Okay.  And I suspect that early on he kind of put a spark in me, because, as you know, I was not trained in history, but kept broadening myself and broadening myself and became a community popular historian and started out volunteering.  When I went to those Freedom Schools, when we had the school stay-outs in Boston [Massachusetts] protesting the segregated school system in Boston, okay, de facto segregation.  When I went to the Bowdoin Boys Club [ph.] and then I went to a church one time to work with those black students who stayed out of school.  See, we had them come to a place for the day, I was teaching black history to the young people, saying, "Well, if they're going to be out of school, we're going to do some black history."  And that's what John Henrik Clarke was doing.  And then, of course, he did it on a more formal basis.  And now, I mean, the stuff he wrote, the anthologies he put together, his work with freedom ways is just outstanding.  And I don't think that we'll ever forget him.  We shouldn't forget him.
Story_ID: 228386
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know if those conferences of ASALH [Association for the Study of African American Life & History] in those days were just magical with all the different, you know, you'd see C. L. R. James and John Henrik Clarke and other just great historians.  There was [HistoryMaker] John Hope Franklin and everyone would be there.  But--okay.  So these--what has seen the reception to the three books on science and scientists ['Seven Black American Scientists,' Robert C. Hayden], inventors ['Eight Black American Inventors,' Robert C. Hayden] and medical pioneers ['Nine Black American Doctors,' Robert C. Hayden]?  What has been the reception for those, you know, in the public school systems around the country?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in the '70s [1970s], somehow I was squeezing in time to conduct teacher-training workshops and seminars, and I was author-in-residence for a week in the Richmond Public Schools [Richmond, Virginia] around these three books.  I think I visited almost every elementary and high school in Richmond in a week.  I mean, they had me programmed, talking with teachers, talking with students.  And I have all my work on slides.  So all of my illustrations, and so I do a slide and illustrated presentation.  So I had so many opportunities like that.  For two years, I was consultant at the University of Oklahoma [Norman, Oklahoma].  I can't remember the name of the people.  I know they had a big grant to work on science--blacks in science in the curriculum.  And so I was part of that group, and we would visit the university at Norman, Oklahoma, like every three or four months.  So I had that opportunity.  What else.  Well, I went to the Education Development Center, called EDC, in Newton, Massachusetts, in 1973 when I left the METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts] program, the directorship, because I wanted to go back to BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts] and see if I could get my doctorate degree.  But at that point, I had shifted out of curriculum and instruction as a field into administration, school administration.  I decided I wanted to be an administrator.  But I went to EDC and directed a program in African art and culture, which is a federally funded program and we worked in--for cities across the country, preparing materials and teacher training.  And I also worked on a mathematics project, it was funded by Carnegie [Foundation], National Science Foundation [NSF].  And then the ethnic heritage studies programs were being funded--the office of education--the heritage studies was big in the '70s [1970s].  And they had a lot of money and a lot of RFPs [request for proposals].  And I was interested in that. But I had just come back from a research trip in New York City [New York, New York].  Actually, I was working on the doctor's book ['"Mr. Harlem Hospital": Dr. Louis T. Wright: A Biography,' Robert C. Hayden].  And I went to a community meeting in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts] at Freedom House, eight o'clock meeting.  And I was telling [HistoryMaker] Frank Jones, who had arrived early with me, he said, "What have you been doing?"  I said, "I just came back from New York doing research on these doctors and working on this book."  And Frank Jones said to me, "Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden]," he said, "you ought to be doing this work full-time."  I said, "Frank, I can't.  This is on the side."  I said, "You know, I have a job.  I have to work.  I have a family to support."  I had four children. Right? He said, "Well, you need to do this full-time."  He said, "You should go to MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts]."  I said, "MIT?"  "Yeah," he said.  "You should get in the Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows]  in urban studies and planning."  I said, "What's that got to do with blacks in science and community, you know?"  But he saw the connection.
Story_ID: 228387
Speaker 1: I knew the two directors of the Community Fellows Program [Mel King Community Fellows, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Massachusetts], [HistoryMaker] Hubie Jones and Mel King [HistoryMaker Melvin King].  And I applied because I said I want to do ethnic heritage studies with urban school districts, and that was appealing to urban studies and planning people.  I mean urban studies and planning, MIT is about everything in urban America; not just housing and infrastructure and engineering and so.  It has to do with education, too.  So I was very fortunate to become a community fellow at MIT for a year; 1975, '76 [1976], put my application in.  So I had my second full year, full year fellowship.  And what I did that year at MIT was to write two proposals that I submitted to the office of education [Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education].  One was a church-based ethnic heritage studies project in which I was training the Sunday school teacher types in black, Puerto Rican, Irish, Italian and Jewish churches to in-turn, teach young kids how to do neighborhood history, their own ethnic history related to their churches.  The second proposal was a school-based approach, in which I outlined a program that I was going to develop in two eighth-grade classes; one in Boston [Massachusetts] and one in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I got both of those projects funded by the office of education and took them back to Education Development Center [Newton, Massachusetts] as the project director.  So what you do when you work for an R and D [research and development] operation, is you get your money and come back, you run your program.  So I ran those two programs for two and a half years.  Materials were published, so I did that in the late '70s [1970s] and then ran another project.  And I'd been at EDC for seven years running African art and culture, the math project, then my own two projects, and then another project that I ran.  And by the end of the '70s [1970s], I really thought it was time for a change.
Story_ID: 228388
Speaker 1: And there was a position open, and somebody had called me about the director of secondary technical education at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And the application deadline had come and passed.  They had interviewed people, but certain people said, "Bob [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], get a letter over to so and so.  Get an interview.  You'll be great for the job."  I ended up being employed by MIT for two years directing MIT's partnership with the Boston Public Schools [BPS].  That had been ordered by Judge [Arthur] Garrity back in 1974 in that federal court that desegregated the Boston [Massachusetts] schools, all of Boston's colleges and universities were, quote, required to enter into to a partnership with the Boston Public Schools.  And so MIT was working with science and math.  I directed that project bringing the resources to the people, and in some cases the money, to enhance and develop and nurture math and science education in the Boston Public Schools.  I did that for two years.  I represented the college-university coordinators.  There were twenty-three such partnerships.  I was on a committee of six, representing all the coordinators of these college partnerships.  They had to send a representative to the search interview committee for a new superintendent of the Boston Public Schools.  I was selected to represent the college coordinators on the interviews, and I interviewed almost all of the superintendent candidates.  The guy who got picked was Robert [R.] Spillane.  Robert "Budd" Spillane was the superintendent in New Rochelle [New York].  He gets the job in Boston.  I'm still at MIT.  Okay.  A year later, I had left and was running--I was still at MIT.  Anyways, it's a year later, this superintendent needed a person of color.  In the superintendent's office, there weren't any.  He was not going to get his contract, a full-fledged contract, as he had taken over a partial contract, unless he got somebody in the superintendent's office who was going to deal with community affairs.  Well, I guess he talked to people and so--I didn't know this was going on.  One day I saw him at a luncheon, and he said, "I want you to call me.  I want to talk to you about something."  Talked to him, I think, the next Monday or Tuesday.  He said, "I want you to come here and be a special assistant in the superintendent--to me in the superintendent's office.  Well, leave MIT, leave this job.  But I'd already been working in the schools.  I knew the school system backwards and forwards.  Okay.  Writing the METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts] program in the early '70s [1970s], I knew the school system.  Everybody knew me.  I took the job.  I was voted in 5 to 0, positive by the Boston School Committee.  Within a year, I became deputy superintendent of schools in Boston.
Story_ID: 228389
Speaker 1: I was deputy superintendent [for Boston Public Schools (BPS)] for four years.  I went right in at the top.
Speaker 2: From what year to--
Speaker 1: From MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  I graduated MIT '82 [1982]; 1982 I left MIT, gave up the two years and went to the Boston [Massachusetts] schools.  [Robert R.] "Budd" Spillane resigned, went to Fairfax County, Virginia.  Laval [S.] Wilson, the first black superintendent, came to Boston from Rochester [New York].  I worked under Laval Wilson for a year.  I served at the pleasure of the superintendent.  I had no tenure in the system, because I had come in through the superintendent's office.  I'd never taught in system.  Okay.  But I had a big job.  I had a big job and loved it, every bit of it.  Very--I mean, it was, tiring.  You had to be there at six in the morning, [Boston] School Committee meetings run over to twelve--midnight in some cases, and then you had meetings after midnight.  But anyways, five years of being deputy--well, first special assistant then deputy superintendent.  I then left and took over the Massachusetts Pre-Engineering Program [Mass PEP] for five years, executive director.  And I stayed there from 1987 until 1991, all of five years.  And this was a program funded by corporations and schools of engineering in Boston to promote and provoke and nurture young black and Hispanic students to go into science and math.  So again, I'm back working with the Boston Public Schools through the Mass PEP program.  And I resigned and retired from that job in 1992, after five years of directing that program. And I essentially retired after thirty-two years.  I worked there, worked thirty-two years in all these different jobs and started working as a consultant and doing research and doing writing.  And, of course, my college teaching was going on at that time.  So I've been retired, working really for myself and doing part-time teaching since 1992.  And I've had at least a half a dozen, I guess it's eight, I don't know, I've got two more that just came out, books out since that time.
Story_ID: 228390
Speaker 1: Tell us about some of those books, now.  They're on the table, so, we don't miss any of them (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: What are they?
Speaker 2: The one that's one of my favorites, and it's now five years old, it came out in 1999, it's called, 'African-Americans on Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket[: A history of people, places and events,' Robert C. Hayden].  Been a very, very popular book.  It's gone through a second printing, and at this point in time, at this very moment, it's going out of print.  I've gone through two editions of that book.
Speaker 1: And now, this is a fascinating subject for some reason.  And, you know, there was a movie made a few years ago.  It was a comedy.  I don't know how much worth it had, but it was called 'The Inkwell' about blacks on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  And there's been a lot of discussion about blacks on Martha's Vineyard.
Speaker 2: Well, that was not a very good portrayal of the Inkwell [Town Beach, Oak Bluffs, Massachusetts] or Martha's Vineyard.  And, in fact, none of that was shot here on this island.  It was all done, I think, in either North or South Carolina.  None of what you see in there actually is Martha's Vineyard.  They took it to some other site and brought some people in and did it.  And I don't think much of the piece.  I don't think it was well done.
Speaker 1: I think one thing it did was popularize the idea that there are black people on Martha's Vineyard, that folks who don't live in the Northeast don't know anything about.  We just--when we think of Martha's Vineyard, we think of an all-white (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that I think the book points out is that--and one of the guys who was working on the book at the printing house said to me when he was working on the book, he says, "How far does this book go?"  I said, "Well, it goes back to the 1700s."  He said, "There were black people on Martha's Vineyard in the 1700s?"  And I said, "Yes."  I said, "They were enslaved."  And he looks at me, he says, "Slaves?  On this island?"  I said, "Yeah."  So I said, the book starts with those who were enslaved as early as 1703.  Another aspect to doing this book and, of course, living here myself for the last ten years roughly, is the population of black retirees on Martha's Vineyard is expanding every year.  More and more blacks are retiring here.  And I think that's an interesting phenomenon.  Prior to that book, I had done a similar book called 'African-Americans in Boston[: More Than 350 Years,' Robert C. Hayden], and I had also done a book on 'African-Americans and Cape Verdean-Americans in New Bedford[: A History of Community and Achievement,' Robert C. Hayden], Massachusetts, my hometown.  So I'd actually done two books with--heavy on photographs.  If you'll look at them, heavy on photographs, short on text.  One on Boston's [Boston, Massachusetts] African American history, one on New Bedford [Massachusetts], my hometown, and then this book on Martha's Vineyard.
Story_ID: 228391
Speaker 1: I guess my favorite book is my biography on Dr. Louis Tompkins Wright [Dr. Louis T. Wright], called '"Mr. Harlem Hospital"[: Dr. Louis T. Wright: A Biography,' Robert C. Hayden] because I had the idea for that biography and the first to do that biography on Dr. Wright back in 1975, '76 [1976] when I was doing the research for a chapter on Dr. Wright in my first book ['Seven Black American Scientists,' Robert C. Hayden].  And I said, in 1975, '76 [1976], I said, this guy deserves a full-length biography.  And someday, I want to write a biography.  And I kept thinking about Dr. Wright all those years.  I had a chance to go to the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] in the mid-'90s [1990s], and that's how I was able to do that book.  So that--people say, "How long does it take you to do a book?"  I say, "Well, this one took twenty-five years."  I didn't work on it straight for twenty-five years.  But I had the idea to do it.  So that's an important book.  A book that just came out yesterday, I just receive it, it's called 'Catalyst: The Autobiography of an American Chemist[, Dr. Samuel P. Massie,' Dr. Samuel Proctor Massie and Robert C. Hayden].  And that book, when you look at it, is the life of Dr. Samuel Proctor Massie [HistoryMaker Samuel Massie], who for twenty-six years work was professor of organic chemistry at the U.S. Naval Academy [Annapolis, Maryland].  Well, the book is by Dr. Massie with me, but I essentially helped him to write this book, and I just got the copies in the mail yesterday.  That book, it was funded by the National Science Foundation [NSF] and the U.S. Naval Academy.

Speaker 1: The other book that I'm very proud of and it came out a month ago, and there's going to be a major book signing here next week, it's called 'William E. B. Du Bois, Family and Friendship: Another Side of the Man,' [Katherine Bell and Robert C. Hayden].  The book is based on thirty-three letters that were received by and saved by Katherine Bell Banks.  Mrs. Banks is ninety-two years old, and she lives here on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] in the summer.  And I met her last summer at an art gallery.  And she commented on my Dr. Louis Wright book ['"Mr. Harlem Hospital": Dr. Louis T. Wright: A Biography,' Robert C. Hayden] and proceeded to tell me that her father had been a doctor in Newark, New Jersey, and New York, and that she knew Dr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois and, that she had all these letters from Dr. Du Bois, and that she wanted to publish these letters and how do you do a book.  I mean, she was groping for me, well, how do you put all this together.  And she was ninety-one last summer.  To make a long story short, I went to her house late August, right around this time, here in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts], not too far from here, where she had brought from her home in Orange, New Jersey, all of these thirty-three letters from Dr. Du Bois to her, from Dr. Du Bois to her mother and father, from her mother and father to Dr. Du Bois, that she had saved.  And I read these letters.  And the very first letter that she showed me was sent in 1926 from Dr. Du Bois when he was in Russia.  His very first trip to Russia was sent to Mrs. Banks, her name was Katherine Bell then, when she was fourteen years old.  Their families became very, very close in New York City [New York, New York].  Most people don't know about Du Bois' family life and his close friendships.  These letters talk about an intimate, close friendship with Dr. and Mrs. Thomas Bell and their two daughters, Katherine Bell Banks and her late sister Thomasina Banks [Thomasina Yolande Bell Fitzroy].  So I worked with Mrs. Banks all year, and we got this book out a month ago.  And she's going to have a big book unveiling and book signing at her house here next week, August 26th.  So a work with her on that just came out.  So those are my most two recent works.
Story_ID: 228393
Speaker 1: There any interesting facts you discovered about [W.E.B.] Du Bois that people would be surprised at, you know, about--
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that I learned about him was that, and this may be known, I'm not sure; I'm not sure that [HistoryMaker] David Levering Lewis, in his two-volume Du Bois biography ['W.E.B. Du Bois: Biography of a Race, 1868-1919,' and 'W.E.B. Du Bois, 1919-1963: The Fight for Equality and the American Century,' David Levering Lewis]--Dr. Bois had a tremendous appetite.  He loved to eat.  He was always concerned about every meal and what he was going to partake, you know.  Mrs. [Katherine Bell] Banks, and it's in the book ['William E. B. Du Bois, Family and Friendship: Another Side of the Man,' Katherine Bell and Robert C. Hayden], tells a story about how he was teaching at Atlanta University [(AU); Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] in 1934, '35 [1935] and beyond.  And her first teaching assignment as a French teacher was at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia].  She finished college in New Jersey.  Couldn't get a job as a colored woman teaching in New Jersey at the time, she goes to Spelman College.  She has lunch with Dr. Du Bois at Atlanta University on many occasions.  And in the cafeteria one day, Dr. Du Bois was standing in front of Mrs. Banks, she was here and behind Mrs. Banks was a young black male history professor from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  They all would come to AU to have lunch.  And she said it was obvious that this young man--or maybe she knew this--had not met Dr. Du Bois and was anxious to have a conversation to get to know Dr. Du Bois.  And she said the young man said--now, they're in the food line getting their food--"Dr. Du Bois, what do you think about the food crisis in Russia?"  And Mrs. Banks said, "Dr. Du Bois did not look up from his food tray, did not look up from the food table.  He said, 'Young man, all I am thinking about is the food I am about to eat.'"  And she said, "I was stunned."  He said, "He didn't even turn and look at the young professor.  He just got his tray and went down," she said, "I wanted to laugh and then I went like this.  But anyway, that's," you know, she says, "that's Dr. Du Bois.  He loved to eat."  And he would invite himself--some of the letters would show how he invited himself to the Bells' home, because he wanted Mrs. Bell's cooking.  And he wrote a letter inviting himself to the Easter Sunday dinner at the Bells' home, but he wanted to know what Mrs. Bell is going to cook.  "And if it's good, I will come."  And he is being a little facetious but, you know.  I understand Du Bois loved to eat, never learned to cook, he couldn't cook.  According to Mrs. Banks, one of the things that he did very well, he was very proud of, was his brewed coffee.  So if you were ever invited to his house for dessert or for dinner, he always fixed the coffee, and that's what he was proud of, his brewed coffee.  So one of the things that I learned about Du Bois, you know.  But what were you going to say?  I know that you had a question.
Speaker 1: No.  I was just saying that that story kind of fits up to of--most of the Du Bois stories are very brisk.  You know, he's shown that he's a very brisk character--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who gets right to the point--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and is always thinking about something else it seems.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  These letters are very brief and concise.  And when you look at the reproductions of them, they're very brief and concise.  But as Mrs. Bell said, and I get the feeling, she said, but it shows you the guy still had some tenderness to him.  He still cared, he still had feelings.  And that's what she wanted to--this book to purvey, that she knew this man.  You know, he would come to her house on Sunday afternoons in Newark, New Jersey, and the first thing he wanted to do, "Katherine, where are the comics?  Let's read the comics."  And she said, "I would sit on the floor and he and I would read the comics together."  That don't sound like Du Bois.  But he loved the comics, and he had to read them every Sunday.  He didn't come to her house every Sunday, but whatever Sunday he came, she said that was the ritual, reading the comics with Dr. Du Bois.  So she said this was a very loving guy, very caring guy.  But, of course, a man of the world and a man who was preoccupied because of great relations and social changes and so on.  But this shows him, you know, when he's got a little time to be with his friend, Dr. Bell and Dr. Bell's wife and the family and so on.  And then the times that they shared together and the things they did together.  So that's what that book is about, you know.  So, I, you know, I was fortunate again to meet this lady and have a chance to work on this.  And so that's my eighteenth book in publication, actually.
Story_ID: 228394
Speaker 1: You've done some research on William Monroe Trotter, too, another famous Boston [Massachusetts] figure and his relationship with Dr. [W.E.B.] Du Bois.  I believe there's an article about his relationship with Du Bois, I think, that you wrote.
Speaker 2: After the Boston Riot of 1903, which took place at Columbus Avenue A.M.E. Zion Church [Boston, Massachusetts] on Fremont Street [sic.] in Boston.  That riot occurred on a summer evening when Booker T. Washington came to Boston to hold a meeting of the National Negro Business League [NNBL] that he had founded.  He founded that in Boston in 1901.  So now he's coming to Boston in 1903.  And Mr. Trotter had published in his Saturday issue of the [Boston] Guardian newspaper a week or so before, fourteen questions that he wanted Booker T. Washington to address when he came to Boston.  And, of course, the questions appeared in the Guardian, so everybody in Boston and the world knew what the questions were and what Trotter's expectations were.  Well, you know, Booker T. Washington, he wasn't about to answer one of those questions.  Okay.  He was about talking about the National Negro Business League or whatever his message was and so on.  But Trotter was there and his sister [Maude Trotter] was there, and a number of the Trotterites were there, including his newspaper staff waiting for Washington to answer the questions.  And since he didn't they started throwing the questions up to him, right, from their seats.  And, of course, he continued to ignore.  And probably said some things they didn't like.  And some eggs were thrown and some other things were thrown, and a fracas ensued.  The Boston police were called, and Trotter and two of his close companions--colleagues--were arrested, taken to Charles Street Jail [Boston, Massachusetts].  Trotter was arrested again in another incident at the Tremont Theatre [Boston, Massachusetts] when he was picketing.  And he was jailed and fined then.  And my reading of the history is that Du Bois felt that Trotter was being unduly--not victimized--but harassed and punished and so on, and he was incensed by the imprisonment of Trotter, the way he was being treated.  And it seems that Du Bois became much more radical because of the treatment of people like Trotter.  So I read this whole paper about--it's called The Radicalization of William E. B. Du Bois [ph.], particularly as he stepped off of what was happening to Trotter.  Now, of course, Trotter was a very stubborn man, had a big ego, very opinionated; while Trotter, who was one of the founders of the Niagara Movement and was very close to Du Bois.  At the point that Du Bois was ready to merge with that New York group for the Negro to form the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Trotter left the Niagara Movement, came back to Boston and started the [National] Equal Rights League [NERL], so that he and Du Bois, of course, went further and further apart.  But, all this history was stuff that I was learning as I continued to look at Trotter and look at the riot and look at all the other things that were happening in Boston, you know, year by year.  Then, of course, my subject, Dr. Louis Tompkins Wright [Dr. Louis T. Wright], comes to Harvard Medical School [Boston, Massachusetts] in 1911 and becomes enwrapped with Trotter's work in the Guardian.  And so I see my subject then getting involved in further boycotts and protests of William Monroe Trotter.  And so, all of that, you know, continued to expand my reading, my understanding, my teaching, my writing on Trotter.  And so I've written several articles on Trotter, and I also did a slide, tape presentation on William Monroe Trotter some years ago, that was used in school districts and used in colleges and universities.  So, yeah, Trotter has been an inspiration to me.  And Trotter was at the wedding of my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] and father [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.].  My mother and father got married at my [maternal] grandmother's [Fannie Hughes] house, the one I mentioned earlier, in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts].  She got married at home.  And I looked up the Boston Guardian account of their marriage, and William Monroe Trotter was one of the guests at my parents' marriage.
Story_ID: 228395
Speaker 1: Do you have a sense of how [William Monroe] Trotter died?  I know they always say he committed suicide, but do you think that's true or what do you think?
Speaker 2: I have known several Trotter relatives, but not close relatives.  And I'm trying to think of her name now.  But this relative that I'm thinking of--oh, Ellen Craft Dammond was related to Trotter.  I got the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: D-A-M-M-O-N-D.
Speaker 1: Dammond.
Speaker 2: Ellen Craft Dammond.  Yeah.  Her husband was [William] Dammond.  I guess her maiden name may have been Craft, but she was related to Trotter.  I don't remember exactly how.  But I got to know her fairly well, and she would come back from California to visit in Boston [Massachusetts], participate in programs and representing the Trotter family, oh, maybe ten, twenty years ago.  But I remember talking with her at one time, and she emphatically said that he did not take his life.  Now, she didn't explain what happened, but she said he did not take his life.  Other people, you know, have said that he was walking up on the top of the roof of his apartment building and that his dog may have pulled him over, he may have slipped, he may have been tired, he may have gotten dizzy.  I don't know.  You know, I don't know.  I did interview him doing my Boston history.  One of the first black appointed to the Boston Police Department in 1919.  Don't ask me his name, because his name escapes me.  But he was walking the beat that night, as they called it then and even now.  And he happened to be out on Tremont Street right at the corner of Cunard, C-U-N-A-R-D, and Fremont Street when he heard this thump, as he said, "I heard this thump, this noise."  And Trotter had fallen to the sidewalk.  He didn't, I think, detail to me what happened after, you know, he was found on the sidewalk.  And, of course, he died.  So I think it's an open question, you know.  We do have indications that William Monroe Trotter was very distraught at that point in time.  In fact, he died three months after he attended my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] and father's [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] wedding.  I think it was April of 1934.  He was distraught.  You know, the paper pretty much had died and he was troubled keeping the paper [Boston Guardian] going.  He was not financially very well off.  And I think he was about sixty-four, sixty-five at the time.
Story_ID: 228396
Speaker 1: We have some other works here.  There's [Dr.] Louis [T.] Wright book ['"Mr. Harlem Hospital": Dr. Louis T. Wright: A Biography,' Robert C. Hayden]--have we mentioned them all?  I don't think we have all of them.  Blacks on Martha's Vineyard ['African-Americans on Martha's Vineyard & Nantucket: A history of people, places and events,' Robert C. Hayden]--
Speaker 2: Well, the other two I mentioned, the 'African-Americans in Boston[: More Than 350 Years,' Robert C. Hayden], that came about because I had four, what, eight, nine years written a weekly column in the Bay State Banner, called Boston['s] Black History.'  And, again, what people say, "Well, how long did it take you to do that book?"  Well I said, "Over a period of six to eight years I was writing all these columns."  So I had all of the material.  They had to be edited, had to be flushed out, all the gaps and holes had to be filled in, things that I hadn't covered.  So essentially, I had all those articles that I had kept all those years.  And people had been asking me off and on, you know, "When are you going to do a book on Boston [Massachusetts] black history?"  And, in the late 1980s, we celebrated in Boston, 350 years of the black presence in Boston.  The first black slaves were brought to Boston in 1638.  And so we celebrated that in 1988.  And the City of Boston was looking for ways of celebrating the black presence.  And since I had done all of the writing through my newspaper column and other books, I had written a history of 'The African Meeting House in Boston: a celebration of [history,' Robert C. Hayden] culture, and a few other things.  I was asked by the mayor [Raymond L. Flynn] and the office of cultural affairs to do a book on the history of black Boston for that yearlong celebration.  And it was supported by the [Federal Reserve] Bank of Boston [Boston, Massachusetts].  They gave the city a grant.  And that's how I was able to do that book.
Story_ID: 228397
Speaker 1: Another book that I'm very proud of--I don't have it here on the table--but I did a Young Readers version, a biography of Roland Hayes ['Singing for All People: Roland Hayes, A Biography,' Robert C. Hayden], and I'll give you a copy of that when you leave, if you'd like to have it to give to some--I wrote it for young people.  But the occasion for writing that book was the one hundredth birthday anniversary of Roland Hayes in Boston [Massachusetts].  And there had been before his one hundredth birthday, a Friends of Roland Hayes Committee.  And they were working with the school system, particularly with the music departments in the school systems, Boston and Cambridge [Massachusetts], to bring Roland Hayes and his music to young people.  And they asked me, they commissioned me to write this biography of Roland Hayes.  Fortunately for me, his daughter Afrika Hayes was in Boston at the time.  She was also a singer, a soloist herself on stage.  She had a family.  And Afrika Hayes is still living today, and she's teaching music in the Boston Public Schools [BPS].  So I worked with Afrika, his daughter, and I had the opportunity to interview two or three of Roland Hayes' students.  Ronald Spearman, particularly.  Ron Spearman would take the bus from New York City [New York, New York] to Boston to take voice lessons with Roland Hayes and go back to Boston--back to New York on the same day on the bus.  So I interviewed, you know, handful of people; used some primary, secondary source material to do the Roland Hayes biography.  As a result of that, when the Smithsonian Institute [sic. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] came out with a CD on Hayes' unheard music, music that he had performed but had not been published on a CD from the Smithsonian Institute, I was asked to write the liner notes for that.  And that was quite an honor to do that.  That was some years ago.
Story_ID: 228398
Speaker 1: I've done some oral history publications.  I did a history of the Boston [Massachusetts] branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  I was asked to do that book ['Boston's NAACP History 1910-1982,' Robert C. Hayden].  When the NAACP held its annual convention in Boston in 1982, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Benjamin Hooks was the executive director at the time.  And the chairman of the Boston committee for the NAACP meeting asked me to do this book.  And the branch funded it.  And I went to the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.] and looked at the Boston branch archives [The National Archives at Boston, Waltham, Massachusetts] and did this book, and they did 15,000 copies.  So everybody who came to the NAACP convention got a copy of the book.  And Ben Hooks wrote the forward to the book.  And so that was a special deal for me.  I really (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Who were some of the leaders of the Boston branch of the NAACP back in those days?
Speaker 1: That's a good question.  Historically going back to the beginning, Moorfield Storey, a white lawyer from Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], was the first Boston branch president and the director of board of directors from 1900--I'm sorry--1910 until 1916.  In the 1950s, actually in 1948--what is that name?  Oh, I'm blocking out names.  Well, there were two women who were presidents of the Boston branch.  Can't remember the lady's first name.  It will come to me, but the second one was Melnea Cass; Mrs. Melnea Cass, C-A-S-S.  She was the president in the '50s [1950s] [sic. 1962-1964].  Kenneth Guscott, an entrepreneur, real estate developer in Boston, was president.  Joe Feaster [Joseph D. Feaster, Jr.], Jack [E.] Robinson.  Now, as a result of my doing the history of the Boston branch NAACP, and I had a chance to look at what the branch had done over the years and the people who had volunteered their time to work on civil rights in Boston, I became interested in the NAACP.  I had never been a member--I wasn't even a member when they asked me to do the book.  I had no association with the NAACP, just because I was doing all these other things.  Right.  I was interested in civil rights, and I was supporting the school desegregation stuff, and I was doing my stuff in education.  But doing the history, I said to myself, "I want to be a member of the branch."  So I became a member.  And then I ran for the board of directors.  So I became a member of the member of the board of directors of the Boston branch.  And I got so pissed off, excuse my language, and so upset with the policies and direction of one of the presidents of the Boston branch that I said, "I'm going to run for the presidency of the Boston branch NAACP."  And I did.  And I won.  And so I served as the president of the Boston branch NAACP, I think it was 1986 to 1988, one term.  So I've had that experience, I've had that experience.
Story_ID: 228399
Speaker 1: That's something.  Now you--it starts with history and then you become--it becomes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  I got enthralled with the organization [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)].  I said, look what all of these people in Boston [Massachusetts] have done.  This is exciting history.  And we had so many civil rights problems in Boston at the time.  I, being an educator, of course, knew about the problems in education, decided I wanted to be on the board.  And I ended up being the branch president.  And I think Ben Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] was the executive director of the national NAACP during my tenure as Boston branch president.  One of the things I remember was that Roy Camp--not Roy.  His name was Campanella [sic.].  But he was a manager or top guy in the Los Angeles Dodgers.  And remember the statement that he made that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, [Al] Campanis.
Speaker 2: Yep.  Campanis.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Said that blacks could not rise to top jobs in Major League Baseball [MLB].
Speaker 1: Said they lack certain necessities.
Speaker 2: Lacked certain things.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, Ben Hooks jumped on that, and he contacted all the branch presidents where there were Major League Baseball teams.  And he said, "I want you to put a group together and start working with--on affirmative action with the Major League in your city."  And so I put together a task force, a committee of the Boston branch, and we started working with the Boston Red Sox.  And that was really quite an interesting experience and pleasant experience.  I think we made some changes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now, Boston--the City of Boston, including the Red Sox, has a history of--which is strange, I think, to people who are not from around here, they think they see, that Massachusetts, the Kennedys, now John Kerry, liberal, it's a liberal state, you know, free of racial prejudice or somewhat.  But then you see the Boston desegregation with the bloody struggle, you know, of people in South Boston to keep blacks out of their schools, and the Boston Red Sox, the last Major League team to have black players, you know.  Some of that.  So I don't know. How do you--I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, there are a lot of different types of institutions that perpetuate and foster this thing we call racism.  And I always line up racism with institutions and discrimination with individuals.  Individuals can discriminate.  Okay.  But you as an individual cannot hold down a group of people.  You know, Boston is a very conservative city, politically and in the term of the corporate sector and the financial sector.  And so you have top banking officials and corporate officials who are going to protect, you know, the financial institutions of Boston and were looking to preserve and keep things status quo.  So I think that had some part to do with the continued discrimination in Boston.
Story_ID: 228400
Speaker 1: The black church in Boston [Massachusetts], I would say in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], while it collaborated with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], the black church was fairly conservative.  And I think that if the black church had not been quite as conservative in the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s], that they may have been able to exert some influence and pressure to change things more quickly.  We had several black ministers who were very ecumenical and were able to start to bring parts of black and white Boston together.  But Boston is a very small city geographically.  The neighborhoods are very isolated from each other.  And you got South Boston today, which essentially you have to get to from a bridge.  East Boston, you know, is separated by the Boston Harbor.  You have tunnels.  So you had neighborhoods in Boston that, traditionally for two or three centuries, were isolated from each other, and people have remained isolated, you know.  So people didn't know each other.  People were afraid of each other.  And there's been work, you know, the last twenty-five years of trying to break a lot of that down.  And that's why we needed that federal court order to desegregate the schools.  I'm not sure that where we are today we're any better off.  I don't want to get into the subject matter of desegregation in Boston, 'cause that gets pretty complicated.  But, at the time, we thought that if the court order from Judge [Arthur] Garrity, who was right on and has brought about some changes.  But now, the whole demographics of the City of Boston has changed.  In a way, 85 percent, almost 95 percent of the students of Boston now are students of color, you know.  So we're now back with the same kind of struggles of getting adequate resources and teachers to work.  We're now a multilingual black population in Boston, you know; a multilingual black population in Boston as well as the Spanish-speaking population.  So the whole city has changed.  It's quite a challenge, it's quite a challenge.
Story_ID: 228401
Speaker 1: It's interesting earlier you mentioned that MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], under the court order on desegregation of schools was--MIT was required to have some interaction with the Boston Public Schools [BPS] as well as the other Boston [Massachusetts] universities, which there are quite a few of; Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts], Tufts [University, Medford, Massachusetts] and Boston U [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts]--
Speaker 2: Well, let me tell you, that the judge [Arthur Garrity] recommended very strongly and suggested and asked the colleges and universities to enter into a partnership; enter into a dialogue and begin to help the school system to reform itself.  They weren't--MIT wasn't required.  He couldn't require even the public universities to do it.  But his voice was loud, it was clear.  And I believe that all but one of the twenty-three colleges and universities took up the challenge and in some way worked with a school, a collection of schools, a high school or whatever, over a period of years.  And some of that is still everlasting.  But the colleges had to volunteer.  I mean, they had to take the challenge that he threw to them, and it was tough going, tough (unclear)--and but for me it was fascinating work bringing them.  Now, here I am a science major and having worked in the science area, now to go to MIT where I've been a community fellow [Mel King Community Fellows].  That's the other thing, I went back to MIT as a full-time employee.  I haven't been there as a community fellow in 1975, '76 [1976].  So I kind of knew MIT and I knew people there.  So, a lot of people look at my career and look at all the things that I've done, and I've done a lot of things in parallel.  I mean, at the same time that I was teaching at all of these colleges from 1978-on, the same time I was doing my research and doing my writing, getting books published, I was still working full-time.  I had a full-time job.  And all my work, as you can see, related to urban school districts.  Even with the Xerox [Corporation] education division, I was still going out to school districts, urban school districts.  So everything related--so everything in my career, I think, is interconnected, and then things have come together and come apart and come together again.  I mean, for a long time I did administration.  In the Boston Public Schools, I was an administrator, you know.  But one of the things that I did as a deputy superintendent was to have some voice and some input into curriculum, which is true to me.  I love curriculum and black studies curriculum, ethnic curriculum.  So even as a deputy superintendent, I was able to deal with those deputies who were responsible for curriculum inspection.  But I basically was an administrator.  I did the day-to-day work in the superintendent's office.  So, you know, for a time I was consumed with that.  And then I moved out of that and went back into the Mass Pre-Engineering Program [Mass PEP], where I worked with schools across the city, with private resources to do math and science.  So, I've, you know, done a lot of different things in conjunction with each other, parallel to each other.  And they all seem to be connected to me.  And I think, you know, the ball of wax has come together very well.
Story_ID: 228402
Speaker 1: Now, you're retired now somewhat.  I mean, you're still working on things, but what are some of the things you're working on now?  I mean, what do you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My golf game (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My golf game. Yeah.  I'm an avid golfer, and I know that I'm going to--well, I'm in the eighties now, and I hope to maybe get down to a low eighties, maybe in the seventies; but I'm getting older, but I play a lot of golf.  To answer your question directly, and you can imagine, for the last twenty-plus years, I have been gathering material, orally, primary source material, pictures, newspaper articles on my family history.  On the Hayden side and the Carter side, and particularly on the Carter side.  Okay.  My grandmother was Parthenia Carter [Hayden].  Her father, Robert [H.] Carter [III], my great-grandfather--and I must talk about Robert Carter, my great-grandfather, born in New Bedford [Massachusetts] in 1847, was the first African American pharmacist, certified pharmacist in Massachusetts.  He received his certificate in pharmacy from the board of pharmacy, Commonwealth of Massachusetts in 1886.  So I have studied extensively the history of the Carter family; my father's [Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] maternal side of the family.  And so in answer to your question, it's on my dining table, you probable saw it when you came in this afternoon, I'm now, this summer, now that these other two books that I--I'm working on my family history.  I owe it to myself and to my children [Deborah Hayden-Hall, Kevin Hayden and Karen McAdams] and to my grandchildren [James Hayden-Hall and Ella McAdams].  And I'm going to try to spend increasing amounts of time putting my family history together.  I'm dabbling with the opportunity or the possibility of trying to write the Carter family history as a historical novel.  Now, I've said to you earlier, I'm not a fiction person.  I don't read much fiction, and I haven't been writing--I've been writing nonfiction all my life.  But I decided maybe I can turn this Carter story into a historical novel.  So I'm attempting to see if I can do a kind of novel fiction piece.  So family history is really what I ought to be doing and want to try to do more full-time.  I don't have any other book right now on the drawing board.  The book has got to be about my family.  And I have three children, all adults, all married, all doing well.  I have two grandchildren.  And nobody in my family, absolutely nobody in my family--not that they haven't had the interest, but have just had the resources and the time and the wherewithal to get into the family history.  I have it all.  I've collected all of it.  I have bought family together in my family that never would have come together; would never--I noticed one of the questions on your questionnaire, "Do you have family reunions?"  I've never had a family reunion.  My family, in more recent generations, has not been that large, and people have died, and people have been in different places, and schedules haven't permitted a family--so we've never had one.  But I've got all of the material.  And I mean in-depth material, you know.  I had a great aunt that I knew growing in New Bedford.  She was the second black school teacher in New Bedford School, and my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] used to tell me--now, my mother married into the family; this was not her, on my father's side.  She used to say to me, "Oh, I'm still a Carter.  Your great aunt is still a Carter.  She could never keep a man, could never keep a dime."  I used to hear this.  I didn't think much about it, you know.  1932, there was an article in the New Bedford Standard-Times, "School Teacher declares bankruptcy."  It was Estelle Carter, my great aunt.  Now, I wasn't even born then.  That was five years before I was born, and she declared bankruptcy, you know.  So I hear these little stories, you know.  And then I find the documentation.
Speaker 1: She wasn't just talking.  There was something brewing.
Speaker 2: My mother--yeah. And the reason that Estelle Carter, my great aunt, probably was penniless and didn't have a lot of money, is that she, like Julia Davis of St. Louis [Missouri], the school teacher, she was a champion of what she called and what we called Negro history, my Estelle, great aunt Estelle Carter was champion of black history in New Bedford, and she spent her money on books and magazines and speeches and sponsoring things, you know.  She gave her money to educational causes.  That's probably why she didn't have any money, you know.  In fact, I dedicated my book--the book I referred to earlier, 'African-Americans [and Cape Verdean-Americans] in New Bedford[: A history of community and achievement,' Robert C. Hayden].  I dedicated it to my great aunt Estelle Carter.  I have a picture of her, which I'll show you later.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That black parents, students, black academics, all of us who make up the black community, can gain more control over the public schools.  As you know, we're facing a dearth of black teachers in the public schools today.  We don't have enough black teachers.  But somehow, we have got to control what happens in the public schools for those youngsters who are still in the public schools.  I'm not working on that actively myself right now.  But to respond to your question, I think that needs to happen.  And I'm not in urban schools like I used to be, but I think that that is crucial, that the black people can control what's going on in the public schools.  The other thing that I hope will happen is that we will be able to improve healthcare for black men and children and women.  If you don't have your health, you can't read a book, you can't study, you can't go to school properly, you can't work.  Health is very, very important.  So my hopes are that we can gain more control over our public schools for our young black children, and that we can continue to work as we are, working through medical schools and outside of black medical schools and research to improve the health conditions and reduce those disparities that continue to exist.  And those are, you know, the two things.  There are so many things, but those are the two that I'm concerned about, that I think we need to continue to develop our resources toward.  [HistoryMaker] Dr. Beny [J.] Primm, who was a seasonal islander on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts], he's a physician in New York City [New York, New York], and he's going to have a forum at his home next week.  I've forgotten exactly what he's called it, but it's the future of the hope of the American black family; or something to that extent.  So that's going to be addressed here next week, and I will be going to that to see what's going on in that field of urban black medicine and what he's doing in New York, and what resources we need to work on that.  So I'm looking forward to that.
Story_ID: 228404
Speaker 1: At this juncture, what--when you look back on everything you've done, what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I guess my historical writings.  I guess as a--you're interviewing me as a HistoryMaker, so I guess I'm a HistoryMaker that's been making history.  And I look forward to working on book ideas and doing the research and doing the writing and getting the other thing done, getting publishers.  And I just hope that--I guess that my writings will be--they won't be classics, but they'll be useful in the years to come and informative and will provoke, particularly young students, to think about their careers and about possibilities, and to look--a lot of my work, as you can see, is biographical.  And so I'm interested in how people handle their lives, and how they confront issues and problems and make choices.  And I know that when young people read black biographies, if it's written the right way, they can at least get a sense of, well, how did so and so handle this problem or that problem?  And I know that I've had many black students, men, boys and girls, some of whom I've worked with in school districts, but others that I don't even know, whose careers and interest in science have been stimulated, and I've been told this by them and by their parents, by my books.  So that makes me feel good.  I guess, also, I've been told I'm a pretty good teacher.  And I guess I always want to remember to leave, you know, leave a way of teaching, a way of working with students to help them work with each other.  I think you have to teach--today, you have to teach students how to teach each other, and have students to work with each other to learn.  I think the things that I'm trying to do--I'm hoping to run an African American essay contest on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] this coming year, which will be our Black History Month program for the island, okay; again, to get students to begin to read history, to research history and to write, you know.  I just think writing is just so important.  So we've got to get our young black children and teenagers to write, to write, to write, write, write and write well.
Story_ID: 228405
Speaker 1: Is there anything we haven't covered that you think--that you want to mention?
Speaker 2: Well, we talked a lot about maternal family, paternal family, immediate relatives, parents [Josephine Hughes Hayden and Robert C. Hayden, Sr.], grandparents.  I guess, important in my life, and a proud piece of my life, are my three children.  Deborah--Dr. Deborah Hayden-Hall is a physician in Providence, Rhode Island; went to Duke medical school [Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina].  She is a gynecologist, obstetrician.  My son, Kevin [Hayden], is a lawyer; went to BU law school [Boston University School of Law, Boston, Massachusetts].  He's been an assistant district attorney for a number of years and has just taken over the, what's called the Safe Neighborhoods Initiative within Suffolk County [Massachusetts] district attorney's office.  And my youngest daughter [Karen McAdams] is the proud mother of a--I guess she's almost eleven months now--this little baby right there.  She went to UMass Amherst [University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts]; put her own major together in marketing and advertising and photography, and has worked for a number of magazines including Time LIFE, and done a lot of work at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston [Massachusetts].  And she's home now just being a mother.  But my children have done well.  And I think it's harder and harder today for the younger generation of blacks; a lot harder for them today than it was for me, and maybe your generation to find employment commensurate with their training and experience; and the job market is tight, salaries are not what they used to be.  So it's--I think when I came along in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], you know, the Civil Rights Movement opened up a lot of things, and jobs were plentiful and so on.  And they're not that way now because of the economy.  So I find that even my daughter the doctor, my son the lawyer, particularly both in those two professions, you know, they're doing fine but they're not making the kind of money over the years that lawyers and doctors used to make.  And I think that's true.  I've talked to many graduates at Howard University medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  And they, you know, say medicine isn't what it used to be, and that the HMOs [Health Maintenance Organizations] and the insurance business and all that is leaving a bad taste in the mouths of a lot of doctors.  So it's not as easy for people in those professions.  You know, the law firms are not hiring, and then they're merging, and then some of them are disappearing.  So there aren't as many opportunities for lawyers in public practice--I mean in private practice as it used to be from what I understand.  But there are a number of blacks, men and women, who are lawyers who have chosen not to practice.  And my son has chosen to be more involved in more community-oriented work.  And in this case, working in the district attorney's office and dealing with neighborhood crime and that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 228406
Speaker 1: Is there anything, when you look back at the things you've done, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I got that liberal education that my math teacher Melver [C.] Felton told me to get.  I got the liberal education.  Didn't realize I was getting it.  I wasn't even thinking about it when I was at BU [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts].  But, you know, and I realize that, although I don't speak foreign languages, I can read other languages, but I don't speak them.  But you've got to know, you know, a little bit about economics, the philosophy, and psychology.  And you got to know a little bit about every discipline, public policy, et cetera, et cetera; government.  I just think that's important for all young people.  You know, what should young people be striving for, and that is to be multidisciplinary to know a lot about a lot of things; just as you do.  Talking to you, obviously, you have read a lot and you're able to draw on many different experiences and readings that you've done.  And I just hope that young people realize that they have to be involved in many different areas of interest and not to be afraid to take a chance.  I guess the other thing that I would like to follow--see people follow.  I've always taken a risk.  I've always taken chances to do something different.  I mean these career changes that I've made, the different jobs I've took meant that I had to leave something to try something else.  And some people thought, well, that's pretty risky, you know.  When I left Xerox [Corporation] education division, even my mother [Josephine Hughes Hayden] said, you know, to go into the METCO [Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity, Boston, Massachusetts] program, community work, you know, you're leaving a good job, big paying job and so on, security; you get all those perks and benefits, you know, and stuff, but I decided I wanted to get out of corporate.  I was at Xerox for three years, and it was corporate, and get into community.  I took a big leap, and it was the best leap I ever made in my life, that job running METCO.  So you got to take chances and try different things.  And so I'm glad that I have moved around.  I know a lot of my friends, college friends and other friends that stayed in the same job, the same company, the same thing year after year; and, well, they've done well, and they've made their contribution.  I'm not sure that they've been as happy as they could have been.  But I haven't been afraid to move around--try different things.  And so that's another message that I have for young people, particularly young black people, to take chances.  And you'll see in some of the biographies that I've written on some of the black doctors particularly they were willing to take a chance to jump out to do something different, and it made a big difference in their life.
Story_ID: 228407
Speaker 1: Tell me--well, when did you start coming to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] that was a--
Speaker 2: I started in 1960.  And my wife and I, at the time, were invited by another couple friend of ours, to come for a weekend.  And even though I grew up in New Bedford [Massachusetts], which is only a thirty-minute car ride, forty-five-minute ferry ride to the island, I only came here once as a child.  And as a--even as a college student, never came here.  I mean, it was just off my map, off my radar.  But I came that weekend, and I enjoyed it.  I liked the island.  My wife and I, at the time, and our children, we came back the next summer and rented.  And I think we stayed a week or two weeks.  And so every week through the '60s [1960s] up through the mid-'70s [1970s], my family and I would come here for two weeks' vacation.  Then the mid-'70s [1970s], I was at--yeah, I guess it was mid-'70s [1970s] or early '80s [1980s], we separated and divorced.  She kept coming here.  She's here now.  She has a home.  And I kept coming, and my children, of course, kept coming.  And now they're here as adults.  My youngest daughter [Karen McAdams] is here on vacation right now for a week and half with the new baby [Ella McAdams].  And my son [Kevin Hayden] comes from Boston [Massachusetts] with his wife.  And my other daughter's [Deborah Hayden-Hall] son [James Hayden-Hall], my grandson, is here.  In fact, he was (unclear) Friday.  So I've been here all of, what, forty-four years.  But when I left the Schomburg [Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York] in the summer of 1995, I came here for the summer to start working on the [Dr.] Louis [T.] Wright biography ['"Mr. Harlem Hospital": Dr. Louis T. Wright: A Biography,' Robert C. Hayden].  I said, I'm going to start writing.  Did the--going to start mapping this book out.  Well, some other writing projects came up.  I came back in '96 [1996], rented the same place; '97 [1997], rented the same place, and was still writing every summer, but just enjoying the summers here.  And, of course, I had retired, so I didn't have to work in the summers.  And then I decided about four or five years ago to just live here twelve months a year.  And so I've been here since, about four years now full-time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it's a great place to write.  It's a great place to do your writing.  You know, you have golf and the beach, and people--I get up at five o'clock in the morning.  I do my best work between five and eight.  And I follow one of [W.E.B.] Du Bois--Du Bois taught me something, although I may have done it anyway; I'm getting older.  But you know, Du Bois would always go to bed at nine or ten o'clock at night.  Du Bois was an early-going-to-bed.  He felt that that was best for his health and got him going the next day.  So I go to bed very early here unless I'm out for a dinner or party or doing something special.  I'm in bed by nine o'clock, but I'm up at five.  And I find that that routine just really keeps me going, and I have plenty of energy.  So I thank Dr. Du Bois for suggesting that that might be a good way to live (laughter).
Story_ID: 228408
Speaker 1: Now, just for the record, you're not related to Lewis Hayden of Boston [Massachusetts] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: --the famous Lewis Hayden of the 19th century?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: And you're not related to Robert Hayden, the poet?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Or Robert Hayden (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) However, maybe we should finish on this note, because--
Speaker 1: Well, we have one other question, though.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, go ahead.  Well.
Speaker 1: So I don't want to finish on that.  But, go ahead.
Speaker 2: I used to get the poet's mail, Robert Hayden the poet.  I used to get his mail; he used to get my mail.  I missed a trip to Africa in 1976 [sic. 1977]--FESTAC [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria]--because the group in Washington [D.C.] that was planning the American groups to go to--where was it--Lagos [Nigeria]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was sending the mail to the poet thinking, oh, it must be Robert Hayden the poet, and they stopped sending me mail.  Couldn't understand why I hadn't responded.  I said, "I haven't gotten anything."  One time I gave a talk on Cape Cod [Massachusetts], Black History Month.  I finished my talk.  The lady comes up with a bundle, an armful of red-stemmed roses.  She says, "Well, we're a little embarrassed.  We have the right Robert Hayden, and the wrong Robert Hayden."  The people in Hyannis [Massachusetts] on Cape Cod thought they had invited the poet Robert Hayden.  He was a member of the Baha'i Faith.  The red rose was the flower of the faith, and they thought I was the poet.  So they had brought these red flowers.  So they gave them to me anyway.  Well, anyways, Robert Hayden and I finally talked--the poet.  And now, most people don't know this.  Robert Hayden was a name that was given to him by his--the people who adopted him.  He was born Asa Sheffey and he died legally Asa Sheffey and not Robert Hayden.  He had two names.  Asa Sheffey was his birth name, Robert Hayden was the name given to him by his birth--by his adopted parents.  At three--
Speaker 1: How do you spell--I'm sorry--how do you spell that, Asa Sheffey?
Speaker 2: Asa Sheffey.  S-, I think it's, S-H-E-F-F-E-Y, Sheffey.  I can get that for you.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 228409
Speaker 1: To make it very quick, his [Asa Sheffey; Robert Hayden] parents could not raise him.  At three months of age, they asked their close friends in Detroit [Michigan], William and Sue Ellen Hayden [William Hayden and Sue Ellen Westerfield], if they would take their son, Asa, and take care of him and raise him.  His parents separated and split.  He was raised by the Haydens.  They gave him the name Robert Hayden.  He found out at age twenty from his mother, whom he still had contact with, that William and Sue Ellen Hayden never legally adopted him.  They raised him from three months through adult, a young adult.  So the name Robert Hayden was not his birth name.  Okay.  He wrote me a letter, which I thought I'd--I'll show it to you.  He wrote me a letter when he was at the Library of Congress [Washington, D.C.]. If you remember, he was poet laureate of the United States in the late-1970s.  He wrote me a letter from the Library of Congress promising that he would start using the middle initial E for Earl.  And then maybe I should start using my middle initial C for Carter, 'cause I wasn't using my middle initial.  I was going by Robert Hayden.  Okay.  I was being brief.  And he said, "And this will stop all the confusion of the gods," as he called it, you know.  If you look at books in print that came out years ago, some of my books are under his name, his poetry books are under my name.  I used to get calls to come and read poetry.  I used to get requests from publishing companies for permission to reproduce a poem from Robert Hayden.  So we're not related.  Hayden was not his birth name.  He died with two names as far as I'm concerned.  But I've read all of his poetry, and I've learned a lot of history by reading his poetry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He's a historical poet.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Renegade [sic. 'Runagate Runagate,' Robert Hayden].
Speaker 1: The 'Middle Passage,' [Robert Hayden].  When I teach African American history, I use the 'Middle Passage.'  My students start to read Robert Hayden's--and that's how we get into the slavery and the slave trade, you know.  So, no, I'm not related to--and he died, as you know, I think, in 1980.  We never did meet.  But we did talk and we did communicate by letter.  So that's the Hayden story.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, that will answer questions for--you know, that anybody has that's watching this interview.
Speaker 1: Right.  That I'm not the poet.
Speaker 2: Right.  And the relationship between the two of you.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 228410
Speaker 1: Our last question is generally this, though if you have another last answer, it's all right (laughter).  Our last question is: how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a HistoryMaker, which is what this project is about; as one who has developed some history for the public, for all people; not just black students and black readers, but for all people; to try to develop some history that's never been told before or to try to tell it in a different way.  I guess that's been my goal, my ambition since I started this some thirty-plus years ago.  I guess the other way I'd like to be remembered is simply being a good friend to all the people that I've met, known from college [Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts], in my career and here on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].  I enjoy people.  I enjoy being with people.  And hope I might be remembered as simply a good friend.

Speaker 1: This is my mother, Josephine Hughes Hayden.  And this picture was taken approximately in the mid-1980s, maybe 1984, 1985.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  Ready.
Speaker 1: My mother again, Josephine Hughes Hayden, and I suspect this picture was probably taken in the early 1930s; perhaps before her marriage [to Hayden's father, Robert C. Hayden, Sr.] in 1934.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  Thank you.
Speaker 1: Photograph of myself, Bob Hayden [HistoryMaker Robert C. Hayden], with my youngest child, my daughter Karen--Karen Elizabeth McAdams.  And this was taken here on Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts] during one of her visits here.  I think we were going to get ice cream, as I recall.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.  We're ready.
Speaker 1: These are my three children.  This picture was probably taken about 1995 roughly.  On the left is my daughter Dr. Deborah Hayden-Hall; my son, Kevin Roberts Hayden, the lawyer in the middle.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I got them mixed.  Let me start over.  On the left is my youngest daughter Karen.  All right.  In the middle, my son, Kevin, the lawyer.  And on my right, Dr. Deborah Hayden-Hall, my daughter the doctor, taken here, by the way, on the beach, on the beach here in Martha's Vineyard.  This is a picture of myself, Bob Hayden and my mate, Tara Bright [ph.].  And this picture was taken, I believe, here at our house, here in Oak Bluffs [Massachusetts], on a, I think, an outdoor party that we had several years ago.  And my son, Kevin and his dog, and I can't remember the dog's name at the moment.  Probably is important to him.  This was taken on the front porch of the home of my parents in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  And that was taken probably six to eight years ago.  This is Grampy, as he calls me.  I'm holding my first grandchild, James Hayden-Hall.  And he was probably about two years old in this photograph.  And this was taken here in Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  Next.
Speaker 1: This is my great-grandfather, Robert H. Carter [III], born in 1847 in New Bedford, Massachusetts; the first African American in pharmacy in Massachusetts.  And he practiced pharmacy from 1870 until 1907 in New Bedford and Boston, Massachusetts.  And he owned three drugstores and worked at seven or eight others during his lifetime.  On the far right is my great-grandfather, the patriarch of the Hayden family, John D. Hayden [ph.], born in Stafford County, Fredericksburg, Virginia, in 1830.  And sitting beside him is my great-grandmother, his wife, Susan Berry Hayden [ph.], and eight of the nine Hayden children.  And I don't know whether I can point with this or not, but this youngster here is my father's father, my grandfather William Henry Hayden.  And I would say he was about five years old when that picture was taken.  I think it was taken about 1882.  And he was born at about 1878, 1877 in New Bedford.  Four of these children, the oldest ones in the rear, in the back row, were born in Virginia.  And then there were five more children that were born in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  One of the children is not in that picture.  But this is my favorite picture, and this picture has allowed me to go back to Virginia along with newspaper obituaries to do the research on the Hayden family.  Estelle Carter.  She was one of the six children of my great-grandfather Robert Carter.  She was a school teacher in New Bedford, Massachusetts for some twenty-two years; the second black teacher in the New Bedford system; a founder of the New Bedford branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], one of the founders, in 1916; and a great champion of what they called at that time, Negro history.  She wrote history, she spoke history, she loved history, and just promoted it all over the city in New Bedford; Estelle Carter.  This is a photograph of myself and my brother, Bill [William H. Hayden]; taken, I think it may have been Christmastime, but I'm not sure, in the living room of my parents' home.  I am probably--well, I was three years old, and he looks like he was probably one.  So I was probably about four years old here maybe, roughly, and he looks like he was maybe just starting to crawl, so then maybe he was about almost one.  I'm not sure.  I don't think there're any dates on the back of that one either.  Me, Bob Hayden, taken at my Grandmother [Parthenia] Hayden's house in her backyard.  And I don't know, I'd estimate I was probably--what do you think, maybe nine or ten years old?  Well, that's one of the earlier pictures of myself.  This is the wife of my great-grandfather Robert H. Carter, the pharmacist.  Her name was Parthenia Harris Carter.  And she was born in Norfolk, Virginia, and was brought to New Bedford at age nine.  Her father was Jewish.  His name was Joseph Harris.  Her mother was black.  She owned a beauty salon in New Bedford.  She was a chiropodist.  And the lady, as I understand, was an elocutionist and would travel around New England giving [William] Shakespeare readings.  And undoubtedly, this photo of my great-grandmother, Parthenia Carter, she perhaps was on stage about to read some Shakespeare or some piece of literature.
Speaker 2: This was around what time you think?
Speaker 1: Well, her husband, my great-grandfather, died in 1908.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So this could have been either a little bit before or after that time.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I mentioned during our interview that becoming a member of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Chi Chapter, Boston, Mass [Massachusetts] was an important part of my life, and this was my line.  We were called the Fabulous Five of K-A-Psi.  And we crossed the burning sands on April 17th, 1957.  And pictured here is Dickey Mapp [ph.], who is now deceased; Tommy Lawrence [ph.], who lives in Minnesota; Mickey County [ph.], who was a paraplegic, who lives in Washington, D.C.; Bobby Fortune [ph.], who is deceased; and yours truly, Bob Hayden on the far left.  The Fabulous Five of K-A-Psi.  Those were the brothers that I was made into the fraternity with.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah.  This is a picture of Chi Chapter, Kappa Alpha Psi, Boston, Massachusetts, 1958, 1959.  Brothers who were made a year before me or brothers that were made--that I made into the fraternity and some that--well, all of them I made that came after me.  And many of these brothers I'm still in touch with today.  One of them is retired on the island; several are deceased.  But I remember every last one of them.  And I guess you can see me in the back row, second from the right, I guess.
Speaker 2: This you?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Well, yes.  So that would--on my left.  No.  Right here.
Speaker 2: Here?
Speaker 1: So, again, a very important part of my life.  And I've saved that picture.  This is Joseph Butler Hughes, my mother's father, the Pullman porter.  If you'll look at the sleeve on his uniform, there're, I believe, nine bars; each one representing five years of service for the Pullman Company.  He actually worked fifty years, from 1890 to about 1940.  And this is a picture of my grandfather standing at his station by the train, by the sleeping car perhaps, at South Station [Boston, Massachusetts] in Boston.  And I think this was probably taken somewhere in the late 1930s, maybe 1940.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  I'm sorry.  I just notice that there's some reflection from that (unclear).  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is my grandmother Fannie Hughes, the wife of Joseph Butler Hughes.  And it was to my grandmother's home summer after summer as a child I would visit, and she would visit us in New Bedford.  Again, a woman who was a homemaker and who was very, very dear to me; taught me how to live and to live right.  A very generous person, very gracious person.  Fannie Vagner [ph.] Hughes.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  And what's the insert?
Speaker 1: Oh.  That is a photo taken in front of her home in Roxbury, [Boston] Massachusetts.  So I guess one of those summers when my brother and I were staying with her.  And I don't have my glasses on, so I can't tell you how old we were then, approximately.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: I suspect that I was probably maybe five or six years old, and my brother was about three years younger.  So he may have been about three.  But this is a picture of myself, my brother and our Grandmother Hughes in Boston, Massachusetts.
Speaker 2: OFF-CAMERA SPEAKER:  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a younger picture of my great-grandmother Parthenia Harris Carter, whom we looked at just a minute ago.  She was born, as I said, in Norfolk, Virginia.  And I guess this was probably one of her elegant pictures.  She was a hairdresser, did hair works, as they called it in those days.  She probably did her own hair, too.  Looks like she may have done it.  That's my--other great-grandmother on my father's side.
