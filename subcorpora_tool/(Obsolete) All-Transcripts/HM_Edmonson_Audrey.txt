Speaker 1: So, we- we'll start now, talking about your family.  We'll go on both sides of your family.  Let's start with your mother.  Tell, please tell me her name, when and where she was born and bit about her.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Her name, when she passed away was Florence Downs [Florence Smith Downs].  She was born Florence Smith in Nassau, Bahamas.  She was raised by both her mom and her father.
Speaker 1: What was her birthdate?
Speaker 2: July 17th, 1914.
Speaker 1: So, in the Bahamas in the early 1900s.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she have siblings?
Speaker 2: She had a whole lot of them.  If I could name them all.  I know I'm going to miss some of them.  It was fourteen of them.
Speaker 1: Fourteen.  Okay, fourteen.  Where did she fall in the birth order?
Speaker 2: Number five.
Speaker 1: Number five.  Do you know how many girls, how many boys?
Speaker 2: It was more girls than boys that's for sure.  Let's see.  It was Rebecca [Rebecca Smith], Estelle [Estelle Smith], Delia [Delia Smith], my mom.  I'm trying to count the girls.  Millie [Mildred Smith], Arabelle [Arabelle Smith], Helen [Helen Smith].  I'm missing another girl in there.
Speaker 1: But, there're fourteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Fourteen children?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, Blanche [Blanche Smith].  There was Blanche.  I'll remember them as I (laughter) it was--
Speaker 1: That's good.  That's good.
Speaker 2: It was too many of them.
Speaker 1: Well, it's a lot.  And, so, what did, what did--what are her parents' names?  And, what did they do?  What was their work?
Speaker 2: Miriam [Miriam Minnis Smith] and James Smith.
Speaker 1: And, what--
Speaker 2: Miriam didn't work.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  She was a homemaker?
Speaker 2: She was a homemaker and she did all of the babysitting.
Speaker 1: Well, she, she did work.
Speaker 2: For all of those (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She had fourteen children (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.  She, she raised them and then she raised the grandchildren.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So.
Speaker 1: In Nassau?
Speaker 2: No, here.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: By that time, she's here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, James Smith, her husband, what did he do?
Speaker 2: You know, I'm not sure what my grandfather did.  But, I know he left to go to work.  But, I never asked because I guess I was too young.  I was very young when they passed away.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. And, and how far can you trace your mother's family back?
Speaker 2: We did a family tree in the Bahamas and they went all the way back to, in, in--a native Indian girl, and I can't remember her name, that was thrown over on a ship, a slave ship because they thought that she was too sick to continue on to the states.  So, they threw her overboard near one of the islands.  And, she, with the help of some other supposedly sick cargo was able to make it to land.
Speaker 1: So, she had been, so she was native to the Bahamas, Indian?
Speaker 2: No. She was on a slave ship coming from Africa.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, she was thrown overboard in the Bahamas because she was seen as too sick to make it to the states.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, that is the one who became--
Speaker 2: That's the one who--
Speaker 1: --the ancestor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, your mother, what was her work?
Speaker 2: She did domestic work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and when did her family leave the Bahamas?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Probably around, and I'd say it had to have been because she, she was about four years old when she came to the states.  And, she had one more sister that was younger than her.  The rest of her siblings were born here--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) in the states.
Story_ID: 650770
Speaker 1: So, most were born--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and, do you know anything about the family and the family's work when they were in the Bahamas?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know much about the Bahamas.  I can tell you more about here in the states than I can the Bahamas.  But, we--every Christmas and summer I was shipped off to Nassau [Bahamas].  That's where I--they babysat me over in Nassau because I was a bit far behind my, my other siblings.  So, they were doing their own things.  So, I had to go to Nassau, which I didn't like at all.
Speaker 1: Oh, you didn't?
Speaker 2: Oh, I would have fun sometimes but my family was, my mom [Florence Smith Downs] was strict.  But, they were extremely strict in the Bahamas.  And, plus some of the, some of--you know, we would, we would change up every time I went I would stay with a different cousin or whomever.  We would rotate.  And, some were more stricter than others.  And, others had the little wooden houses with the outside bathrooms.  And, then you had to actually take a bath outside in the big tub.  So, when it was time for me to go to one of them, I didn't wanna go.  But, it was fun.  It was, it was fun growing up.  That was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were those--?
Speaker 2: --one of my fondest memories with some of my other cousins.
Speaker 1: Were those houses that--in, in the country?
Speaker 2: No.  Nassau, really is a small island [New Providence, Bahamas].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: There was not really any country, per se, in Nassau.  There was just small houses and neighborhoods.
Speaker 1: And, in those small houses where the--were they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But, it wasn't all of them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, in the ones that were like that with the outhouses and the tubs, they were in the front?  Is that how that was?
Speaker 2: No.  I can remember my cousin, Bertha [ph.].  Now, cousin Bertha had a CBS [concrete block structure] home and it had a bathroom in it.  But, she had about seven children.  So, she--in order for her to keep her bathroom clean, she had the outhouse.  So, (laughter) they had to use the outhouse.  And, she lived on a corner lot, with no fence, no nothing.  You could just walk into the backyard.  And, they would put up this big tub, and we had to go out and take a bath in the tub.  And, I remember I always wanted to wait until after dark.  She didn't want us to wait until after dark (laughter).  So, I'm taking a bath and here comes this handsome young man that I had my eyes on (laughter).  And, he's seeing I'm taking a bath and it's like, there's nothing.  And, he's just walking right up to me, and I'm screaming.  And, I grab my, my, the dress, the only dress I had to put on that day.  Now, that's all wet.  And, I'm standing in the tub screaming and she comes out and shoos him away.  And tells him, he knows better, and he, he's looking like, "But, I wanted to see," (laughter).  So, I remember that.
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: I had to have been at least ten-ish, somewhere up in there.
Speaker 1: Um-hm (laughter).  So, and it--so, you said the family moved to the U.S. when, when your mom was about four years old?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where did they move to?  Where did they come?
Speaker 2: Overtown.
Speaker 1: And, where is Overtown?
Speaker 2: Overtown is just north of the downtown area.
Speaker 1: In--out--?
Speaker 2: Here in Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: So, to neighborhood within Miami.
Speaker 2: It's a neighborhood within Miami.
Speaker 1: And, is that a black neighborhood or was it then?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Always been a black neighborhood.  Is where some of the first settlers settled.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and so that was where they came.  Did they have relatives there already?  Why did they chose Overtown, do you know?
Speaker 2: I know my grandmother, Miriam Minnis [Miriam Minnis Smith] had a sister that came over as well.  Her sister married into the Braynon family.  And she married into the Smith family.  I do remember that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --them talking about the difference in the class systems.  The Braynons were the educated ones and the Smiths were not the educated ones.  And, the Braynons thought they were better than the Smiths, and that, so that was their little feud thing going on.
Speaker 1: And, that's between sisters?
Speaker 2: Sister's children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Sister's children.
Story_ID: 650771
Speaker 1: And, tell me please about your father.
Speaker 2: My father, I didn't know that well.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Earnest Moss.  He came over as an adult on contract.
Speaker 1: So, he's also from the Bahamas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's from Crooked Island [Bahamas].
Speaker 1: And, your mother [Florence Smith Downs] is from what island, which--she's from Nassau [Bahamas] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Actually, her family are from Andros Island [Bahamas].  But, they moved to Nassau.
Speaker 1: Nassau.
Speaker 2: And, she was raised in Fox Hill.  And, which is an area in Nassau.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, is Nassau the bigger among the Bahamas?
Speaker 2: It's the more populated.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's more of the, I'd say the capital of, of the Bahamas.
Speaker 1: And, the Crooked Island is what?
Speaker 2: That, they call that an outer island because that's more, it's not many people live on Crooked Island.  And, they just call it an outer island but it is a settlement.
Speaker 1: And, your father was born there.  Did he grow up there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What is the work on Crooked Island?  Or, what was it then?
Speaker 2: I have no idea what the work--most of the young people leave Crooked Island because it's not of Nassau, in the Bahamas.  It's not a tourist attraction.  So, they normally leave.  They may come back, but you have more elderly and young people there.
Speaker 1: Do you know how your parents met?
Speaker 2: No.  I do not know how they met.  I never asked (laughter). But, they both, when they met, they met when they were living in Liberty City [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  So, they were already here.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  When I was born, I was born in Liberty City in a little wooden house.  He was also living in Liberty City and he did, he did sanitation work.
Speaker 1: In Liberty City?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: Or--?
Speaker 2: --really for the county [Miami-Dade County, Florida].
Speaker 1: For the--okay.  But, but he grew up in the Bahamas.  How many siblings does he have?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I only met two.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I met two brothers.
Speaker 1: And, do you know anything about this family?
Speaker 2: Not much.  I know--I knew his children because we did not--he had his set.  I was the only child (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --for him from my mom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I did know my, my siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, but he wasn't really in your life?
Speaker 2: He would come around on Tuesday.  I think--when I look back at it now that was the day he had to give his (laughter), child support check, or dollars.  And, we would go driving out for, he would take me and we'd get ice cream or we would go sit on Virginia Key Beach [Miami, Florida] and look at the water, and maybe talk or something and then he'd take me back home.  But, I remember that growing up.
Speaker 1: So, you had a weekly date?
Speaker 2: I had a weekly date, yes, Tuesdays.
Speaker 1: That's nice.  Was it fun?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, I looked forward to it.  I was, I was waiting for him to come up.  I knew exactly what time he was coming.
Speaker 1: And, did your mother ever participate in that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No.  That was the two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was, she was married.
Story_ID: 650772
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that was the two of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had already remarried.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. So, your parents meet in Liberty City [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now, when, when your mother [Florence Smith Downs] moved, it wasn't--Overtown [Miami, Florida] is not Liberty City, right?
Speaker 2: No.  It's two different--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --communities.
Speaker 1: So, when did she move to Liberty City?
Speaker 2: It was before I was born.  I know my older sister and brother, they were born in Overtown when they were there.  The rest of us, Liberty City.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, and so, your mother remarried Mr. Downs [Sevenell Downs].  Is that right?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  She married John Sands first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At a very young age.  I think she was fourteen.
Speaker 1: When she's in--?
Speaker 2: No.  Here in--
Speaker 1: Here, okay.
Speaker 2: Here in--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Oh, right 'cause she was four when she came.
Speaker 2: They divorced and she married, what was his name, Monroe, Terefus Monroe.  And, she had, for Sands she had two children [Julia Sands Mobley and John Sands], for Terefus she had, Sonny [David Monroe], Frank [Franklin Monroe] and Sandra [Sandra Monroe].  And, then, from my father [Earnest Moss], it was me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, then who is Downs?
Speaker 2: Downs was her last husband (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter).  All right.
Speaker 2: Oh, she was something else (laughter).
Speaker 1: Did she have children with him?
Speaker 2: No.  She was too old by then (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, the tot- how many children did she have total?
Speaker 2: Six total.
Speaker 1: Six children.  And, you fall in where?  In the middle?
Speaker 2: I'm at the very end.  As a matter of fact (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You're the la- ?
Speaker 2: I'm far behind the rest of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm, I'm the one they call the late baby.  The real accident.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So--
Speaker 2: When she, she didn't even realize she was pregnant with me until I started kicking.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a heavyset lady, so.
Speaker 1: And, so, when you were born, were any of the other siblings around or they were already grown up?
Speaker 2: Two were already out of the house.  That was the two oldest.  My oldest sister had already had--she was married, and had two children before I was born.  So, I'm a real late baby.
Story_ID: 650773
Speaker 1: When you think of your growing up, go all the way back there, and what do you recall as your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Actually, my [maternal] grandmother [Miriam Minnis Smith].  I was telling Misty [Misty Brown] a story, but I'm not gonna tell that story about the bathroom (laughter).
Speaker 1: You don't want to?
Speaker 2: Nah, what do you think Misty?  Should I tell that story about the bathroom?  I had to have been a very young girl.  But, I had to been about two years old.  And, I remember I was crazy about my grandmother.  And, I used to call her Utna mama [ph.].
Speaker 1: Utna?
Speaker 2: I think I was trying to say other mother, or mama, or whatever.  But, somehow it came out as Utna mama.  And, I had, she had, you know, she had one bathroom.  Of course, back in the smaller homes.  And, I had, she, she really kept all of us.  All of the grandchildren from all of the--her children (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And, is this in the Bahamas?  This grandma?
Speaker 2: No, that was here [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: This is here.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And, I had to go to the bathroom and so I'm running into the bathroom.  I'm a little young something.  And, she was in the bathroom and I'm bamming on the door, "Utna mama, I gotta go to the bathroom.  I gotta go pee."  She said, "Okay.  Hold it, hold it, hold it."  And, I kept bamming.  She said, "Just hold it, baby."  Finally, I couldn't hold it anymore.  So, I just did it all right there on the floor, right in front of the door.  And, that was one and two.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And, she came out of the door and she looked down at it, and she looked back up at me, she said, "You couldn't hold it, huh?"  And, I'm looking up at her, "No."  She said, "Okay, let's fix you up then."  And, I--for some reason that sticks in my mind.  That--and don't ask me why, but it sticks there.
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't get in trouble.
Speaker 2: No.  I didn't get in trouble.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: She cleaned me up and sent me right back on out.
Story_ID: 650774
Speaker 1: When you think of, either the home you grew up in, when you're little in the neighborhood, what are the sights, sounds, and smells that you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember in Liberty City [Miami, Florida] on Saturdays a horn would go off and it was always somewhere near, I guess, in the afternoon.  And, it sounded as if it was coming from downtown and they always said the horn was the practice for the bombing.  They used to practice in case the bomb came.  And, that was this horn and it came up every Saturday, you would hear this horn.  That's one of the things I remember.
Speaker 1: In what year are we talking about now?
Speaker 2: We're talking about the '50s [1950s], 'cause I was born in '53 [1953], so.
Speaker 1: Middle, middle to late '50s [1950s]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I, I remember that horn.
Speaker 1: What about smells?
Speaker 2: I don't remember so much about smells.  I do remember that horn.
Story_ID: 650775
Speaker 1: Do you remember what you, what the neighborhood looked like?  Your house?
Speaker 2: Well, we lived in a little house; and Liberty City [Miami, Florida] was really thriving then.  I lived right off of 15th Avenue, which has really gone down now.  But, they had nightclub on 15th Avenue.  We had beauty parlors, barbershops, you name it.  We had, we had the ice cream shops, the drug stores.  We had The Miami Times on 15th Avenue.  You name it, we had it.
Speaker 1: So, it was a thriving neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was really thriving back then.
Speaker 1: Were there a lot of black owned businesses?
Speaker 2: Every business on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Every one?
Speaker 2: --15th Avenue was black owned.
Speaker 1: And, so, what were your, your nei- well, did you live in a house?
Speaker 2: I lived in a house.
Speaker 1: And, so--
Speaker 2: I lived in the house that I was born in.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, your neighbors, what do your neighbors do?
Speaker 2: Everybody knew each other.  Everybody, somehow, you didn't wanna be bad in front of anybody.  Not even on the next street over.  I remember being on the next street and, you know, just playing, running up and down the street, you know.  And, the lady, one of the ladies was sitting on the porch and she said, "Is that Florence's [Florence Smith Downs] baby over there?"  She said, "I'm going to tell your mama.  Get your butt back over there."  And, I got back over there, but I didn't dare tell my mom someone had to make me get back either.  The neighbors on 69th Street, they all watched out for each other.  They didn't lock their doors either.  And, most people would think everyone locked their doors, but we didn't.  I was one of those latch key babies coming home from school.  And, I just walked in and walked right inside the house and closed the door and went in.
Speaker 1: And, did your neighbors were, what is the composition?  I know you say it's a black neighborhood, but like your mom is from the Bahamas.  Are people--is it Caribbean and American?
Speaker 2: You had a mix because next door was Ms. Moss [ph.] and her family was more from the Carolinas.  You did have a mix, American.  I'd say the majority of them were not Caribbean.  But, we--I can tell you one thing for sure, most of my mom's siblings lived in--within a five block radius.
Speaker 1: Oh, so, you were close?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We could run right through the front of someone's house into their backyard into my aunt's backyard and it was right there, safe again.  And, we had my Aunt Estelle [Estelle Smith] that lived about three blocks.  They were all between 18th Avenue and 15th Avenue, it's about 65th Street and 71st Street.
Story_ID: 650776
Speaker 1: Did you all go to church?
Speaker 2: We went to church, yes.  But, my, my [maternal] aunts, they all went to different churches.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, that wasn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I think I only had one, one aunt went to the same church we went to?
Speaker 1: And, what, what denomination did you go to?
Speaker 2: That was United Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was something else first and then they turned United Methodist as I was growing up.
Speaker 1: So, in your home, what, what were the rituals that were important?
Speaker 2: In our home, growing up (laughter), I'll tell you what the ritual was. On Saturday mornings when you got up, you better be ready to clean up and do a real big spring cleaning.  You cleaned, and cleaned that house from top to bottom.  And, that was every Saturday morning.
Speaker 1: And, what time did you have to get up to do that?
Speaker 2: We, on Saturdays we normally got up around eight [o'clock]. That was late.
Speaker 1: And, what happened if you weren't?
Speaker 2: Oh, she got us up.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: She definitely got us up.  My sister [Sandra Monroe] had her things to do.  I had what I had to do and my mom's thing was the kitchen.
Speaker 1: What was yours?
Speaker 2: I had to do the bathroom.  I had to do my mom's bedroom.  I had to do our bedroom.  My sister did the living room and she did the dining room.  And, then there was my brother's room. I never could understand that he had no chores whatsoever.  I had to clean his room.
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.
Speaker 2: So, that was it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That was the house.
Speaker 1: What was, what was he doing while you all were doing chores?
Speaker 2: His own thing (laughter).  Frank [Franklin Monroe] was retarded so my mom [Florence Smith Downs] kind of babied him even in his adult life.
Speaker 1: Was he ever able to work?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  He works.
Story_ID: 650777
Speaker 1: Your siblings, what were their different occupations as they grew up?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  Let me start with Julia [Julia Sands Mobley].  She was a nurse's aide.  Willie [John Sands] was a caddy.  Sonny [David Monroe] did various laboring jobs.  Frank [Franklin Monroe] was the retarded one.  He worked in sanitation when he did start working.  Then, Sandra [Sandra Monroe], she was a lab technician.  Is--
Speaker 1: And, you had, you had--
Speaker 2: Well, she's--they're all retired, so.
Speaker 1: You had one brother who passed away young.
Speaker 2: That was Sonny.  That was the one that did the various jobs.
Speaker 1: What happened to him?
Speaker 2: Cardiac arrest, and I think that's what my mom [Florence Smith Downs] told us.  But, we knew that it was drugs.  We knew it was an overdose.
Speaker 1: And, when you say, Frank was retarded, what did, what did that mean?
Speaker 2: When he was diagnosed, I think my mom said, she noticed something was wrong when he was about four.  He hadn't started talking at all.  Not even one word.  And, she took him to a doctor, and the doctor just said, "Well, he's retarded.  He'll be about ten years behind his own age," and, so, she went from there.  When he turned twenty, she always said ten years behind so he had a mind of a ten year old.  So, she still treated him at the age of twenty as if he was ten.  Finally, I think Frank finally left when he was around twenty-five saying, "I'm grown, I'm not a baby," and he just left and disappeared and she looked all over for him.  When she found him, she got my other brother (laughter) and she got some of the cousins and they went and dragged him back to the house.  And, told him he was gonna stay at the house.  So, Frank left again.  So, finally, my, my [maternal] aunts, you know, they have these little family type meetings or whatever.  And, they said, "Leave him alone and just keep an eye on him."  And, so, Frank finally ended up on his own.
Speaker 1: So, do you think that maybe he was autistic?  'Cause back then retarded was such a big category (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, because he, he's still living now.  And, I would be able to tell if he's autistic.  He's, he's slow.
Speaker 1: Slow.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, he's married now.  And, we were somewhat worried when he told us he was marrying.  We were thinking someone was going to use him until we met her.  And, she was a bit slower than him.  So, we were fine.  We--
Speaker 1: And, did they have kids?
Speaker 2: No.  No.  She has two of her own.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: Right here in Miami-Dade County.  I graduated from Miami Jackson High School [Miami Jackson Senior High School, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: And, where did you go to elementary and?
Speaker 2: Oh, elementary, Allapattah Elementary [Allapattah Elementary School, Miami, Florida].  As a matter of fact, it was a handful of us that actually integrated Allapattah.
Speaker 1: So, Al- where is Allapattah?
Speaker 2: It is now called Lenora B. Smith Elementary School [Lenora Braynon Smith Elementary School, Miami, Florida].  It's no longer Allapattah Elementary.
Speaker 1: And, you integrated it.  This is what year, now?
Speaker 2: This was about 1961, or '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, integrating a school as a child, this is still--
Speaker 2: It was different.
Speaker 1: Yeah, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Because I went to Liberty City Elementary [Liberty City Elementary School, Miami, Florida] prior to that.  And, that was all-black, black teachers, black students, everybody's black even the principal.  And, then when you--we went over to Allapattah, it was all-white teachers, white students even the janitors, they were white.  It--I felt uncomfortable because I wasn't accustomed to being around white people.  And, when you live in a black neighborhood never had in your life had been around whites, you feel uncomfortable.  And, you feel as if they're more superior to you at that age.  So, you, you kind of, you sit there and you're afraid to talk, you're afraid to do anything.  So, you, you sit there and I guess they think, well, that's the best behaved child.  When actually, you're afraid because you don't know what could happen.  And, and nothing really did happen.
Story_ID: 650779
Speaker 1: Do you know why your mom [Florence Smith Downs] made the choice to send you there?
Speaker 2: She moved from 69th Street to 51st Street.  And, at that time 51st Street that was an all-white neighborhood.  We saw white flight within a year.  When we moved in there a year later, it was an all-white neighborhood.  A year later, it was only about three whites on the block.
Speaker 1: So, this is around '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which is around the time when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Really about '60 [1960] because we did not transfer over to Allapattah [Allapattah Elementary School; Lenora Braynon Smith Elementary School, Miami, Florida] until after the school year was over with Liberty City Elementary [Liberty City Elementary School, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: So, this is around the time, '60 [1960], '61 [1961] when there was a loosening up, blacks were allowed legally to move into (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) To move into the white neighborhoods.
Speaker 1: --into the white neighborhoods.  And, so, she, she choose to move.
Speaker 2: She moved.
Speaker 1: Had, had Liberty City [Miami, Florida] changed by then, when you were, when she left, or?
Speaker 2: No.  It was about the same.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't because--
Speaker 2: It's changed now.
Speaker 1: Right.  But, back then, it wasn't that the neighborhood had become a bad neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not yet.
Speaker 1: It was just, it was just a better home?
Speaker 2: It was a better home.  We moved from a wooden house to a CBS [concrete block structure].
Speaker 1: What is CBS?
Speaker 2: Brick [sic.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, what got me, the house was actually smaller because we had three bedrooms in the wooden house.  When we moved to 51st Street it was only two bedrooms.  And, it had what she called the Florida room in the back, which was a sitting room.  And, she converted that into the third bedroom for my brothers [John Sands, David Monroe and Franklin Monroe].
Speaker 1: So, did you like that house, the new one?
Speaker 2: I liked the neighborhood because it had a park right on the next street.  We could easily walk through the back, we were always walking through the backyard into someone else's yard and we'd be right at, at that time it was Manor Park, now it's Hadley Park [Charles Hadley Park, Miami, Florida].  And, it was a big park and it was active, very active.
Speaker 1: But, you had left the neighborhood where all of your aunts and cousins and everybody--
Speaker 2: They were moving as well.
Speaker 1: Oh, so everybody kind of moved.
Speaker 2: Everybody was trying to be secretive (laughter), and they didn't want us to tell this aunt we're moving.  And, somehow it leaked out that my mom and my aunt Rebecca [Rebecca Smith], they were moving at the same time.  So, then my, my aunt Estelle [Estelle Smith] after she found out, she moved.  And, they--and what, what's so funny about it, they all moved again to the same area.
Speaker 1: So, you stayed together?
Speaker 2: Yeah, kind of, it was walking distance.
Speaker 1: So, for the kids this was good?
Speaker 2: For the kids it's good, yes.  I think it was good for them as well.
Speaker 1: And, was this after, so who was your mother married to at that point?
Speaker 2: When we moved, Mr. Downs [Sevenell Downs].
Speaker 1: Mr. Downs.  And, what was his work?
Speaker 2: Mr. Downs did custodial work.  He was a janitor for a medical center.  And, he did some late night jobs in other medical centers.
Speaker 1: And, and your mom, what was she doing then?
Speaker 2: Domestic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, she did that all through?
Speaker 2: As long as I can remember, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what--
Speaker 2: But, she used to say she worked in a laundry when, a laundromat when she was younger.  Because she had--her mom [Miriam Minnis Smith] pulled her out of school when she was in the sixth grade, after she completed sixth grade, which she did with a lot of the other kids.  I guess, they had to work.
Speaker 1: And, as a domestic, who is she working for?
Speaker 2: She worked for, and I'll never forget this lady because my mom--I'll tell you that story later.  I think I told Misty [Misty Brown] this one as well.  But, it was the Sugermans, Barry [Barry Sugerman] and Penny Sugerman [Penny Goldman Sugerman].  And, they had a son by the name of Brett Sugerman.  And, this was the, the summer between my, I think it was my eighth and ninth grade, between my eighth and ninth grade year.  Remember I told you every Christmas and summer I had to go to the Bahamas.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well, I, I had this little boyfriend from the eighth grade.  So, we were gonna get together during the summer and just have our fun.  I didn't wanna go to the Bahamas.  And, I cried and cried.  I didn't wanna go to the Bahamas but (laughter)--so she fixed me.  She said, "Okay, you don't have to go."  She had me become a live in housekeeper for the whole summer for Ms. Sugarman.
Speaker 1: She was protecting you from that boy (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, she really, she, she wasn't dumb.  She knew what was going (laughter).
Speaker 1: She knew what she was doing.
Speaker 2: So, the following summer when it was time for me to go, I was all packed.  She didn't have to tell me to pack, I was ready to go (laughter).
Speaker 1: There was no more live in.
Story_ID: 650780
Speaker 1: So, where did you go to junior high school?
Speaker 2: Allapattah Junior High [Allapattah Junior High School; Georgia Jones-Ayers Middle School, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Oh, so, Allapattah is--
Speaker 2: Alla- there was two schools right next to each other.  Allapattah was the new school they had built.  The junior high.  You had the elementary [Allapattah Elementary School; Lenora Braynon Smith Elementary School, Miami, Florida] and then there was an open field next to the elementary, they built the junior high right there.
Speaker 1: And, so, now both of these are integrated schools?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  By the time I got to junior high, we were--
Speaker 1: It was black.
Speaker 2: It was predominately black.
Speaker 1: So, when you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We still had whites but--
Speaker 1: When you were in the elementary school, which you integrated, did you make friends with any of the white students?
Speaker 2: There was a little girl, her last name was Levy [ph.].  Now, we would walk to school together because I would walk right by her house that was on my way and we would cross the park [Manor Park; Charles Hadley Park, Miami, Florida] together and we would talk.  But, that's about it.  You know, for some reason the blacks stuck together and the whites stuck together; and we didn't really mingle, comingle.
Story_ID: 650781
Speaker 1: In your town, as you're, as you're growing up, you know, you've integrated the school; then the neighborhood be- instantly begins to change with white flight.  And, also the Civil Rights Movement is, is really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Is brewing.
Speaker 1: --brewing, are you aware of what's going on in civil rights?
Speaker 2: I was more aware with Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And, I remember--
Speaker 1: So that's high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember my mom [Florence Smith Downs] saying--and I look back on it and I realize a lot of blacks were actually afraid because they would have to go to work.  And, if you did domestic work you went into a white home--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and, they were accustomed to saying whatever they wanted to say.  So, now, you have to be extra careful because now they're becoming aware that the blacks are trying to get their just in the world.
Speaker 1: So, when you say, "They're accustomed to saying whatever they want to say," is this the people they're working for?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And, she went to work one day and--
Speaker 1: This is your mother?
Speaker 2: My mom.  And, she said that she had, the lady that she worked for, they had taken down an old door and they were putting up a new door.  And, she asked the lady if she could have the old door because the door was in good shape.  The lady just wanted a red door.  And, the lady says, "Well, why don't you ask your landlord to put, give you a new door?"  She says, "You shouldn't be putting a door on the house where you live."  And, my mama said, "I own my house."  And, she got fired.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: She said, the lady told her, "If you can afford a house, you don't need to be working here."  And, she fired her.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: So, I remember her saying that, so when Dr. King, and at this time Dr. King, he's really out there.  And, he was on TV.  It was something, I don't know what, exactly what it was but it was him.  And, I heard her say, "I wish he would stop causing all these problems for us."  And, that's the way I, I initially started seeing him because of the comment that she made and her getting fired from off this job.  But, then when I went to school and you would hear your classmates, some of your classmates start talking about Martin Luther King, Jr. it was, it was positive.  So, you get a negative type at home and then when you're talking to the kids at school it was somewhat positive.  I had not come upon a black teacher yet to really speak to.  Even though now, late junior high [Allapattah Junior High School; Georgia Jones-Ayers Middle School, Miami, Florida], early high school, I still had not heard one of them talk about him until I got over to Miami Jackson High School [Miami Jackson Senior High School, Miami, Florida].  Because when I was at, I was at Edison [Miami Edison Senior High School, Miami, Florida] in the ninth grade for one year.  That was predominately white.  So, we really did not hear much.  What we did do at Edison, and that's because of Dr. King, they did not allow any blacks to be on the cheerleaders, the, the Raiderettes and it was another group for the girls.  The boys were allowed--they were playing football.
Story_ID: 650782
Speaker 1: So, you say it was because of Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] that they weren't allowed to do these things?
Speaker 2: No.  It was because of Dr. King that we finally did something about this at Miami Edison High School [Miami Edison Senior High School, Miami, Florida].  We--
Speaker 1: This is after you moved to that school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Only--I was at Edison for a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm in ninth grade now.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Got it.
Speaker 2: So, I'm growing up a little bit.
Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) So, what we did--
Speaker 1: And, this is the predominately white school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --where they're not allowing the girls to--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --to participate.
Speaker 2: The boys were allowed to play in the sports.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The girls were allowed to play sports.  But, they did not choose any blacks who were--and we had a lot that went out for the cheerleaders and the, the Raiderettes, which are the swingettes or whatever you call them.  And, it was another group of girls.  So, we, we had to meet, they--how, I don't know how we pulled this off, you know, we were kids.  We, it was secretly going out, a meeting was gonna be, and they gave us the address.  And, I remember the, the girl's last name was White [ph.].  And, we went over to her home that night, and the word was, "Don't come unless you bring your parents with you."  And, I was afraid but I knew I wanted to go to this meeting.  So, I finally approached my mom [Florence Smith Downs] and I said, "Mom, they gonna have a meeting at a house tonight" (laughter).  I say, "And, they say we can't come unless we bring our parents."  And, she asked me, what was it about?  And, I told her, you know, that--they didn't put any young ladies on the cheerleader squad, they didn't put any--and she says, "And, you're gonna meet over there about that?"  She said, "That can be trouble."  And, I said, "I know, but I wanna go.  And, I can't go unless you go."  She said no more.  We got in the car later on that evening and we drove over there and I was shocked.  She gave me my permission to do a sit-in.  And, we did a sit-in the next day and it took the school by surprise.  And, the media was there.  So, they placed one, one young lady.  They didn't have another, no type of competitive thing.  They placed one young lady on the cheerleaders, one on the Raiderettes and one on the, the other group.
Speaker 1: So it worked.
Speaker 2: It worked.  And, we sat there on the floor quietly.  And, I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) For how long?
Speaker 2: --the, the young lady's father was a doctor, and he's the one that really facilitated everything.  And, he told us, no matter what, just sit there, don't open our mouths, and do not use any profane language, don't talk back, just sit there.  And, that what we did.
Speaker 1: Do you remember how long you sat there?
Speaker 2: We had to have sat there for at least two hours because I think the superintendent, everybody came at--to the school.  So, it was a big thing.  It was in the news.
Speaker 1: They couldn't believe you were doing that.
Speaker 2: They couldn't believe we did that.
Speaker 1: Even though these things were happening across the country--
Speaker 2: And, we sat there and we blocked the office door, right in the hallway.
Speaker 1: And, how many of you were there?
Speaker 2: It had to be a good--because, now when we were at the house, it was only about thirty or forty of us.  But, somehow when we did the sit-in, it had to have been a good fifty, sixty, I mean, it was triple the amount of us that were at the house.
Speaker 1: And, was everybody black?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, all black.  I think the word got around.  And, if you were black you came, and you sat.
Speaker 1: Were you afraid?
Speaker 2: No.  I enjoyed it.  You know, I was young.  You know, nothing could happen to me.  I was invincible.
Story_ID: 650783
Speaker 1: Do you think that's when you got the political bug?
Speaker 2: I think it came more so after I entered high school over at Miami Jackson [Miami Jackson Senior High School, Miami, Florida].  When I started getting into all of the extracurricular activities, Optimist [Optimist International], you name it I was in it.  When I look through my schoolbook, as a matter of fact, Misty [Misty Brown] was with me when I did that too.  When I went back to talk to the seniors at Miami Jackson, they invited me, and they must've gone through that 1971 yearbook (laughter).  And, I could not believe the organizations that I was in, or the committees.  I could--I said, "I did all of that?"
Speaker 1: Like what?  What are some of them?
Speaker 2: Let's see, Optimist, I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What did the Optimist do?
Speaker 2: The Optimist was more of the social services type.  We did a lot of things within the school as well as outside of the school.  We would work with children, smaller children.  We would go do clean ups.  We also, we worked with the track team.  We brought them all their water and that kind of stuff.  So, when the track team traveled, we traveled with them.  You name it, we did it in the school.  We even did some clean ups in the school.  That was one of the main clubs that I was in.  I was junior achievers [Junior Achievement USA].  I'm trying to think of, see I'm going blank now.
Speaker 1: Did you have a--did you start a business?
Speaker 2: I--after I was an adult, yes.
Speaker 1: No, but as a junior achiever.  You know how you have to do something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we had to start a business.  And, then started getting into some money and I said, "I'm not finishing this stuff."  That was one thing I didn't complete which my mom [Florence Smith Downs] should've made me complete.  But, no I didn't finish it.  I'm trying to think, and I was in so much.  Track, I ran track.  I played softball.  I was in the senior mixed chorus.  I was in the girls choir.  I was in the ensemble.  I'm trying to name everything 'cause they, they spelled it all out and I couldn't believe--
Speaker 1: How did you have time to go to class (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Most of this was after school.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, so, it was your extracurricular.
Speaker 2: And, then, you know, I always wondered why my daughter [Ebony Edmonson Dunn] was so active.  I guess she got it from me because she was very active in school.
Story_ID: 650784
Speaker 1: So, when you're, you're--you're getting this civic mindedness while you're in high school.
Speaker 2: But, I really didn't do much with it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: When I came out of high school once I graduated [from Miami Jackson Senior High School, Miami, Florida], I went on to become a flight attendant.
Speaker 1: So, you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For Eastern Air Lines.
Speaker 1: You didn't go to college?
Speaker 2: Not right away.
Speaker 1: Not yet.
Speaker 2: Not right away.
Speaker 1: What did, did--was your family okay with that?
Speaker 2: My mom [Florence Smith Downs] was.  She hadn't--well, I guess because she hadn't had any of her children--I was the first even to go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we all had high school diplomas, I think, except two.  And, the rest we had high school diplomas.  So, she was somewhat satisfied with that.  I came out, I did a little bit of work as a computer programmer.  And, back, you know, it was, you had to really write your own computer plans.  So, that didn't work.  I didn't like being pushed back by myself in a little office.  I'm more of a socialite.  I like to be around people.  So, I didn't stay with that too long.  And, finally, I, I sat home for a couple of days and she says, "Well, what do you think you're gonna do sitting here?"
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And I say, "Well, I'll, I gotta get a job."  She said, "I think you better get out of here tomorrow and get a job because you're not gonna sit here."  So, I, I got on the bus and I took the bus to 36th Street.  I went to Pan Am, Pan American Airlines [Pan American World Airways] and I asked the lady for an application.  And, she says, "For what?"  And, I didn't know.  I looked up at the wall and saw they were hiring flight attendants, so I said, "Flight attendant."  And, she says, "Do you speak a second language?"  I said, "No."  She said, "Well, you might as well not fill out this application."  So, I said, "Well, okay."  So, I walked out, walked down the street, there here--now here comes Eastern Air Lines.  So, I walked in there and the same thing, they're hiring flight attendants.  You know, I knew them as stewardesses.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This is in '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: This is in '72 [1972].  And, she asked what was I applying for?  And, I looked at the board and said, "Flight attendant."  So, she gave me the application.  I filled out the application, gave it back to her, and I guess the rest was history because they called me in for an interview.  I think I went on about three interviews, and I was hired.  And, that ended up in the papers.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: Well, actually the first flight attendants were actually hired by Eastern Air Lines in late '60s [1960s] and that was Janice Maycock and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The first black?
Speaker 2: --Javeen [ph.].
Speaker 1: The first black?
Speaker 2: First two blacks.
Speaker 1: Right.  That was in the late '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I came in in '72 [1972], then the airlines still--when you're hiring blacks, you're hiring about one out of every thousand that apply.  So, it was still, we still weren't there yet.  And--
Speaker 1: So, when you were interviewed, did you have any sense of that you, that you are, you know, making some kind of history as being one?
Speaker 2: Not until I saw it in The Miami Times.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You were just looking for a job?
Speaker 2: I was just looking for a job.
Speaker 1: Had you ever flown before?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the time when I went back and forth to the Bahamas.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, you, you were accustomed to flying (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Story_ID: 650785
Speaker 1: Was that part of the interview process [for Eastern Air Lines], just your comfort on a plane?
Speaker 2: That could've been because that was discussed.  They gave me a test.  I took the test.  That was, you know, the test I took, I couldn't believe the test, you know, it was, "Would you rather be a bishop or, or a cardinal?"  And, you know, I remember things like that on this test that I took.  And, I just took the test and then my last interview was before a panel and as they--at the end one of them said, "Audrey [HistoryMaker Audrey M. Edmonson], we think we're gonna take you on."  And, back then, the things they did they wouldn't dare to now.  Because the first interview I had to walk from one side of the room to the other side.  So, they could see me walk.  And, they asked me to stoop down.  But, I did remember from home ec [home economics], you never bend (laughter).  So, I did do it at the knees (laughter).  So, I did remember some things.
Speaker 1: So, so it was, because, I mean, the original stewardesses as we, you know, see in movies and everything are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Skinny.
Speaker 1: --skinny, fashionable--
Speaker 2: They weighed us every time we came in.
Speaker 1: Right.  They did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  They had the scale right to the door.
Speaker 1: And, what did you have to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, if you were on probation, you got weighed every trip.
Speaker 1: Why would you be on probation?
Speaker 2: Because you had a six months probationary period when you first started out.
Speaker 1: And, what did you have to weigh (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They could just let you go for no reason.
Speaker 1: What was the weight requirement?
Speaker 2: When I started, I was 5'7".  I had to keep my weight under 126.  I could not go over 126 pounds.
Speaker 1: And, were you, was that easy or difficult for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was difficult.  Because when they hired me I was 132 pounds.  And, she asked me if I thought I could lose the weight by that very last interview.  I wanted that job.  I even--I used to even bite my nails.  I stopped biting my nails.  I lost the weight, and I was about 124 at that last interview.
Speaker 1: Just in the process of the interview.  And, this is across what period of time?
Speaker 2: About a three month period.
Speaker 1: So, they needed, you needed to get to the 126 in order for them to hire you?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  I guess they wanted to see how motivated I was.  Or, how much motivation I had.  And, I had it.
Speaker 1: And, at this time it didn't, it didn't bother you that there were these kinds of requirements?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I didn't know any better.  I even had to dye my hair because on my first interview, I think it was my first and second interview, I wore an Afro wig.  So, at that time, and you'll see that (laughter), when you look at my pictures, at one point in time I was blonde (laughter).  My hair was blonde underneath.  So, they had no idea.  So, when I came to, I think the second interview, I told her, I says, "Now, my hair is kind of blonde-ish."  And, she was surprised 'cause she thought the wig was my hair.  She says, "Well, what do you mean, blonde-ish?"  And, I kind of did that little number to her.  And, she says, "Well, are you willing to dye it black?"  (Laughter) And I said, I said, "Yes, I'll dye it."  I wanted this job.  And, she says, "Now, what if we don't hire you?  What if they decide they're not gonna hire you in the next interview?"  I says, "Well, that's okay, I'll just dye it back blonde," (laughter).  And, she gave a little chuckle and--
Speaker 1: So, for the third interview, you'd lost the weight, dyed you hair (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Third interview, lost the weight, stopped biting my nails, and dyed my hair.
Speaker 1: And, how were you wearing it?  'Cause now, you're not having on an Afro wig, what style are you wearing it?
Speaker 2: Shorter Afro.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it was--so, they didn't mind the Afro?
Speaker 2: No.  They did mind the Afros.  Let me tell you what they did.  As a matter of fact, in the class that I was in there were, we had three blacks.  One was really not in the class, she was in the class ahead of us but she got sick so she finished out in our class.  But, there were, we had two blacks in my class that went through.  And, they brought us from all over the country.  Both of us had Afros.  For some reason they kind of liked her Afro.  They didn't like mine.  So, at the end of the class when they see that they're actually going to graduate you, they sent all of us to the, the beauty parlor.  So, I'm sitting up there, I'm telling the girl how I want my hair.  She says, "But, that's not what it says on the paper."  And, this is, we were the first class that they actually sent to a black salon.  They had been sending (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you're at a black salon, okay.
Speaker 2: --the black girls to the white salons.  We were the first.  They sent us to Supreme Wig and Beauty Supply [sic. Supreme Wig and Beauty Salon, Miami, Florida].  And, the girl stands there, and she's looking at it (laughter), she says, "Well, this is not what I'm supposed to do."  I said, "What do you mean, this is not what you're supposed to be?"  She says, "I'm supposed to relax your hair and cut it into a bob."  And, that's what she did.  She put a relaxer on my head.
Speaker 1: Had you ever had a relaxer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did have a relaxer back when I was in high school.  I took up cosmetology.  So, I played around--that's how I got the blonde hair, just playing around with my hair.
Speaker 1: So, again, you wanted the job.  So, you're like--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'll do it.
Speaker 2: I did it.
Story_ID: 650786
Speaker 1: So, then you become a flight attendant.  You're in the paper [The Miami Times] for being one of the first.
Speaker 2: From Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: Right.  The first from Miami.  Is that it?
Speaker 2: I think I was the--no, Janice Maycock was the first from Miami.
Speaker 1: She was from Miami?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  And, what, tell me about that first flight.
Speaker 2: You know, the first flight, I was happy go lucky.  I was young, you know, you don't see--
Speaker 1: What are you like, nineteen?
Speaker 2: I was nineteen.  I turned twenty before I got off probation because you had to be twenty before you got off probation.  And, I thought it went well.  I didn't start seeing anything until I actually started flying.  I guess about two or three months into flying, we flew into Mobile, Alabama.  And, the senior had to do something and she asked me to come and board the plane while she went to the back.  So, I'm standing there and I'm greeting the passengers.  And, of course, people are a little bit shocked when they see a black flight attendant.  A gentleman comes up to the door and he looks at me and he steps back and he says, "I'll be," and he used the D word, "if I get on this plane with that" and he used the N word.  Now, I'm standing there and I'm a bit shocked.  The captain was standing behind me.  And, I'm, I'm so glad he was standing behind me so he turned around, Captain Turner [ph.] says, "Well, I guess you won't be flying on this plane today," (laughter).  And he says, "You can just go on."  He says, he says, "Start--honey, start boarding the rest of the people."  So, I just started boarding the rest of the people.
Speaker 1: So, he supported you.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And, that, that happened on another occasion in Corpus Christi, Texas.  This time we didn't have any incidents on the plane.  'Cause, you know, there's gonna be small incidents.  But, in Corpus Christi, we landed, no problems.  We, we had a layover and when we went to check in, I was told I could not stay, by the, the clerk at the hotel.
Speaker 1: You couldn't stay at the hotel?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is this the first year?
Speaker 2: This is the first year.
Speaker 1: So, '72 [1972]?
Speaker 2: This--I'm still.  Yeah.  This is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Seventy-two [1972], '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973].  Seventy-three [1973].  So, again, the, the, I guess the captain again, the crew, we had minimum crew so they knew they couldn't play this.  And, they had FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] regulations which means we have to get our rest.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, we were leaving out early in the morning.  I ain't got this kind of time to talk about find another hotel or anything like that.  So, the captain spoke up again and he says, "Well, I'll tell you what, if she doesn't live here, the rest of us won't.  And, if we don't live here, then you, your company will lose the contract with Eastern Air Lines."  They gave me a room but they had a bellman sit outside the room the whole night.
Speaker 1: They were afraid for you?
Speaker 2: I have no idea.  The hotel had the bellman.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I guess I was gonna come out and go steal something.  I have no idea.
Speaker 1: And, did you ever go back to that hotel?
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't go back to Corpus Christi (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Corpus Christi.
Speaker 2: --for a while.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, so, this is the same pilot.
Speaker 2: No, this was a different pilot.
Speaker 1: A different pilot.  So, the pilots were, were--
Speaker 2: I think when they probably started hiring African Americans I believe they had some type of sensitivity training with crews when we started coming on.
Story_ID: 650787
Speaker 1: Did you ever have any problems with pilots [at Eastern Air Lines]?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  You had problems with them too.  As a matter of fact, here's another one.  And, this is, this was really more so around the late '70s [1970s], early '80s [1980s] when an incident occurred.  And, this was a black lady, it was about three or four, a group of three or four.  She got on and she was sit- it was an L-1011 [Lockheed L-1011 TriStar], which is a jumbo jet.  She was in the last, very last section and we're coming down the aisle with a cart of beverages.  And, when we got to her, we were out of Coke [Coca-Cola].  She wanted Coke.  So, I told her I says, "We're out, we're completely out of Coke."  There was another cart on the other aisle, I asked them, I say, "You have any Coke?  Can I get it?"  They said, "We ran out of Coke all the way up in cabin C."  So, when she looked as if she was becoming agitated I said, "Let me go to first class," before she start showing out and acting like, you know what.  So, I went up, first class is out of Coke.  So, I came back and I apologized to--, "We're out of Coke. Can I give you something else?"  And, she went off on me.  She called me every name in the book from Oreo to, to bougie to, you name it, she went off on me.  She jumped up out of her seat, and when she got out of her seat, I said, "I'm not staying back here 'cause this woman looks like she's ready to fight."  I started heading back up front to just avoid the whole confrontation, she followed me.  And she's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Over a Coke?
Speaker 2: All for a Coke.  And, she's making all this noise through the airplane.  I headed to the cockpit.  And, I got to the cockpit, and I opened the door, went in.  I say, "Now, she can't get in here."  And, I told the captain what was going on in the back.  And, you know what that man said to me?  "Well, you should be used to it."
Speaker 1: So, he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was his comment.
Speaker 1: So, he did not support you?
Speaker 2: No.  This one did not.
Speaker 1: What ultimately happened?
Speaker 2: We landed in Palm Beach [Florida].  We were coming from, I believe it was New York [New York] to Palm Beach to Miami [Florida].  When we landed in Palm Beach she started making noise again after we landed.  She was going on to Miami.  So, I went up and I told the captain.  I says, "I'm not gonna continue on this flight if I have to worry about my safety."  I says, "I'm not staying."  I said, "Now, either she goes or I go."  Now, by this time, the agent has come on the plane, he's already trying to escort her off.  The captain stopped him.
Speaker 1: He let her stay?
Speaker 2: So, I took my bags and half the crew and we rolled our suitcases off and we rented a car and drove home.  Needless to say, the plane could not leave Palm Beach that night.  Oh, yeah, we got in trouble.  We had a hearing but we got through it.  All of us kept our jobs.
Speaker 1: And, this is over a black woman to a black woman.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  He told me I should've been used to it.
Speaker 1: Did he get in trouble?
Speaker 2: I have no idea because back then with the airlines the, the pilots, they were under a different supervision than the flight attendants.  They, they had their little code of ethics, or silence where they didn't tell us what occurred with them.  We didn't tell them what was occurring with us.
Story_ID: 650788
Speaker 1: So, you, you're with Eastern [Eastern Air Lines], how long do you stay with that company?
Speaker 2: Sixteen years.
Speaker 1: Sixteen years.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, does it include international travel?
Speaker 2: Yes.  By the time I left I had enough seniority.  So, I was flying--and, by that time, I was determined I wasn't gonna go anywhere during the wintertime north of Florida.  So, I had enough seniority to stay either on a lateral type line when Florida fly to Caribbean or go to South America or something like that.
Speaker 1: And, so what is the, the schedule for a flight attendant typically?
Speaker 2: Well, we actually bid on our flights, and we bid by seniority.  By the time I left, I had enough seniority to bid and get really just about what I wanted.  So, during the winter, I didn't fly at all.  As a matter of fact, the last coat that I got stood in my closet and I never even got to use it.
Speaker 1: But, in terms of just, you know, the, the general schedule for, you know, for--?
Speaker 2: Different schedules varied.  You could either, you can bid for a one day trip, or you can fly to, example fly to New York [New York] and fly back.  You can bid for a two day trip if you wanted with one layover.  You could bid for a three day trip.  It went up to about five days.
Speaker 1: And, you're on salary, so is that correct or no?
Speaker 2: We're on salary.  You get a certain amount for a flight.  But, if that flight went over, then that's when you accrued more money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If the trip lasted longer than it was supposed to, you got more money.  You got a certain amount of per diem for the layovers.  That was a different check.  A completely different check from the, the paycheck.  And, you kind of controlled that one.  What some of us started doing was because the company would cheat us out of money for the, the layovers, the per diem, we would hire certain schedulers and they would actually go through all of our trips to make sure that we were getting paid correctly on that.  But, it worked out well.
Story_ID: 650789
Speaker 1: You, when you start there're very few black flight attendants, how are you treated by the rest of the crew in the beginning?
Speaker 2: In the beginning, they were, they were really nice because blacks didn't really get--it was so few of us, we really didn't get to fly a lot together.  But, we knew each other, and we knew who each other, you know.  We were here in Miami [Florida] and most of the blacks were actually in Atlanta [Georgia] or New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's where they want, they chose to go.  So, we had some here in Miami.  And, those of us who were here in Miami, we were close.
Speaker 1: And, did you keep your home base as Miami--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --the whole time?
Speaker 2: I had a choice when I came on [at Eastern Air Lines] and I really wanted to go to Atlanta.  But, Atlanta's base was not opened.  The only two bases that were opened with--no, it was three bases, with my class, was Miami, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So, home seemed better?
Speaker 2: Home seemed better.
Speaker 1: And, where were you living?
Speaker 2: I lived with my mom [Florence Smith Downs].
Speaker 1: So, you stayed at home?
Speaker 2: My mom was a strict Bahamian woman.  You did not leave her house until you got married. And that was it.
Speaker 1: And, though you're traveling all over the place, you were not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Even though I'm traveling all over the place, I still had to stay home.
Speaker 1: So, as you're traveling, having this strict Bahamian mom as, you know, you're coming home to her, what kind of adventures are you having on the road?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You know, I was really a good girl (laughter).  I was really a good girl.  As a matter of fact, I did--I knew I did not wanna date any pilots.  And, I did not wanna date any flight attendants because I saw what they were doing.  And, I just, I--it wasn't gonna happen to me.
Speaker 1: What was happening to them?
Speaker 2: Pilots would use some of the flight attendants, you know.  And, they'll date them for a while; and they'll drop them when the next pretty girl came along.  And, I saw a lot of that.  I saw a lot of hurt people.  And, I just didn't wanna be a part of it.
Story_ID: 650790
Speaker 1: So, I had my own boyfriend here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) At home [Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 1: --here at home, and, that's the man that I did marry.  And, I married him December of '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, while--early on?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  That's--was the only way to get out of my mom's house (laughter).
Speaker 2: How did you meet him?
Speaker 1: Walking down the street.  As a matter of fact, we went to Miami Jackson [Miami Jackson Senior High School, Miami, Florida].  I was in the tenth, he was in the twelfth.
Speaker 2: So, you knew him from high school?
Speaker 1: So, I didn't--I knew of him.  He was popular.  So, I knew of him.  He did not know me.  And, I was, I was going to one of my [maternal] aunts' house.  Remember I said, they all moved in the same area.  So, I'm walking, and I had a friend with me, and I'm heading for my aunt's house.  And, this young man was getting out of this nice car and he was going to one of his friends' home.  And, he spotted us and he yelled, "Hey, wait up."  I'm saying, "What is this?"  So, my friend stops.  She stops.  I said, "Phyllis [ph.], come on let's go.  You don't wanna meet somebody like this in the street hollering wait up."  She stopped and I noticed he went right past her and came over to me and he started talking.  Now, at first, I gave him the wrong address but the right phone number.  You know, I don't want him coming around the house until I know whether or not I want him to come to the house.  And, he called, he called that same night.  We talked, and he called, he called about a week, every night for about a week.  And, finally--
Speaker 2: This is when--were you still in high school then?
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  I'm flying [with Eastern Air Lines].  I'm a flight (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is after--you're flying, okay.
Speaker 1: No, this is before I was flying.  I take that back.  I wasn't in high school, but I had already finished high school.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's in the three month window before you start--?
Speaker 1: No.  This, this, no.  I finished high school in '71 [1971].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, I didn't start flying until '72 [1972].
Speaker 2: Two [1972], okay, got it.
Speaker 1: So, it's during that time--
Speaker 2: That year.
Speaker 1: --before I started flying.  And, I think that was it.  We went on a date.  My sister [Julia Sands Mobley] went on a date with us, her and her husband.  And, we went to, remember back then they had the, what did you call the outdoor movies?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The drive-in theaters.
Speaker 2: The drive-in.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Drive-in, yep.
Speaker 1: We went to a drive-in theater.  And, we, I took my sister and her husband with us.
Speaker 2: And, then you got married the next year?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was kind of, we--well, we kind of met during the summer of '71 [1971]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and, we married December of '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, about two years later.  And, so, now you're not living in your mama's house.  Where--
Speaker 1: Now, I'm not living in my mom's house.  I'm living in an apartment (laughter).  We're renting an apartment.
Speaker 2: What neighborhood?
Speaker 1: It's, I, I remember the address.  It was 70- well, wait a minute now, 7230 Northwest 2nd Avenue.  It was brand new apartments, just built.  And, it was one bedroom apartment.  And, I couldn't drive so he had to take me to work.  And, I remember coming home from work because I--my, my schedule, it, it was, you know, being on reserve, each trip was different.  And, I came in in the middle of the day when he was working.  So, he scoots off from work, drives me, and would drop me off to my mom [Florence Smith Downs] or his mom's house and scoot right back to work because we lived much further from his job.  So, he would do stuff like that.  And, one time I think I called him and he didn't ans- they couldn't find him or something 'cause you know cell phone--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --we didn't have them.  And, we didn't have beepers then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, they couldn't find him and I ended up taking a cab home.  And, then my mom wasn't home because I was short on cash.  So, I took it over to his mother's house.  And, I, I think she was a little bit angry that she had to come up with the money.  So, she asked him for the money when he got--and I had--all she had to do was wait until we could go to the bank and get some money.  Because I had just come off a five day trip.  So, I think that was the beginning of the friction between his mom and me.  She kind of held it against me.  And, we paid her the money back the same day.  But, that's how things go.
Speaker 2: And, he's Edmonson [Edmonson's ex-husband, Louis Edmonson], right?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, he's Edmonson.
Story_ID: 650791
Speaker 1: And how many children do you have?
Two: one biological and one adopted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, when did you have your children?
Speaker 2: Ebony [Ebony Edmonson Dunn] was born in 1976.  That's the girl.  She's the oldest.
Speaker 1: So, you were still flying [at Eastern Air Lines]?
Speaker 2: I was still flying.  And, we adopted L.L. [Louis Ivory Edmonson] in 1989, I think.
Speaker 1: Okay, many years later.
Speaker 2: Or, 1990 because he was fourteen months when we got him, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, Ebony was already--?
Speaker 2: She was about twelve years old.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, so, you are traveling.  How are you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm not flying when we adopted the boy.
Speaker 1: But, with, with Ebony you were?
Speaker 2: I was traveling, yes.
Speaker 1: How did you manage that?
Speaker 2: Well, back then when you became pregnant, as soon as you found out you were pregnant, you had to take a leave of absence.  But, you would collect unemployment.  So, I collected unemployment.  And, we had to come back after the baby was three months.  Which I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't have a problem with it because I had the family and good friends, retired ladies, that would keep her.  The thing about it, now my husband [Edmonson's ex-husband, Louis Edmonson] would not allow her to sleep outside of the house.  So, when he got off from work, and even though they offered, and they kept saying, "We'll keep the baby," he picked the baby up, took the baby home, bathe the baby, feed the baby, got up in the morning, got the baby ready, got the bag ready, and took the baby back to the babysitter.  But, he did that.
Speaker 1: What, and what was his work?
Speaker 2: He was always in automobiles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Car salesman and then he moved his way up to finance manager.
Speaker 1: And, are you still married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But, you have--but, the two children, you, your daughter, Ebony, and what's your son's name?
Speaker 2: Louis.
Speaker 1: Louis.
Speaker 2: Same as his father's.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, being a flight attendant, child, husband, on the road all the time, was that--how did you juggle that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it, it worked well because once Ebony turned four years old and was able to communicate well and be able to talk and tell me things, then that's when we got a nanny.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, it just worked out well.  She's well rounded.  By the time L.L. came in, I'd stopped flying and starting going to school, back to school [at Miami-Dade Community College; Miami Dade College, Miami, Florida].  So, I was there with him.
Story_ID: 650792
Speaker 1: Now, you worked, you said for sixteen years at Eastern [Eastern Air Lines].  But, you also worked at Delta [Delta Air Lines, Inc.], didn't you?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  Okay, no.  It was that Eastern was--oh, okay, now I see, it was, I'm looking at, other first.  It was Patricia Grace Murphy.  Did you know her?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: She was the first African American flight attendant hired by Delta.  In, in and around that period when you first, first joined, how did the airline change?  How did the industry change during the sixteen years you were there?
Speaker 2: When we first, when I first started flying, you couldn't be married.  You could not be married.  You could not have children.  By the time it stopped, yes you could be married, from lawsuits, various lawsuits.  And, I happened to be very close to one of the young ladies who did sue the airline because she had been married and divorced.  And, they would not hire her because she had been married and divorced.  And, she took them to court.
Speaker 1: And, she won?
Speaker 2: And, she won.  And, she was a black girl from Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Huh.  So, did it feel like you're always having to stand up for yourself?  Did you have that feeling when you were there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, we, we--I had that feeling at times.  Not all the time, but I did have that feeling at times.
Speaker 1: Did the male flight attendants have weight requirements?  Or, were there even male flight attendants?
Speaker 2: There was male flight attendants.  And, yes, they did have weight requirements.
Speaker 1: So, it wasn't just for the women?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, by the time I left the airlines, I had been promoted up to a supervisor.  So, I was not in the air anymore.  I went back into the air so that I could get better benefits.  And, so, as long as we were back in the air for about six months, then we would be able to get all of our benefits.  For some reason, in a supervisory position you didn't get as much as the unionized people did.
Speaker 1: Oh, 'cause that, oh, that's not a union job?
Speaker 2: Right, that was not a union job.  So, at the very end I went back and flew for some months.
Speaker 1: In order to get your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My benefits.
Speaker 1: --your retirement benefits.
Speaker 2: My retirement, yes.
Speaker 1: So, retirement for flight attendants would occur--?
Speaker 2: I didn't get the money until I turned fifty-five.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could not collect on it.
Speaker 1: But, you were able to have them hold it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was able to collect.  So, I get a retirement check now from there.
Story_ID: 650793
Speaker 1: Why did you decide to leave?
Speaker 2: The handwriting was on the wall for Eastern Air Lines.  Frank Lorenzo had taken over the airline.  And, he, bit by bit, he's swapping all the equipment away.  And, it was in the media and a whole lot of us left.  And, about a year before they went under.  And, I started my own company (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which was when?  When did they close?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to remember the exact year that I left.  It was about '89 [1989] I think.  I think I left about '89 [1989] or '90 [1990] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, so, what is AT Services [ph.]?
Speaker 2: That was the cleaning--that's what I was just getting into.  I started my own business.
Speaker 1: So, that's '87 [1987]?
Speaker 2: And, that was a maid and janitorial service.  And, but, I started that before I left Eastern.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was doing it from here.  I had a couple of ladies that was working for me.  And, so, once I left Eastern I went full speed ahead and opened up the, the office.  Instead of working out of the house, I started working out of an office and that business really rock--skyrocketed.  I knew to name it A (laughter).  I was told to make sure that it starts with an A, so I came up with an A--
Speaker 1: So, in the phonebook?
Speaker 2: Yes, in phonebook.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, so, you find it.
Speaker 2: And, I put my nice little advertisement in the phonebooks, put some flyers out, paid some people to put flyers out in certain zip codes, and the calls just started coming in.
Speaker 1: So, this is a business you know because your mom [Florence Smith Downs] had done this, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And, what--
Speaker 2: I knew how to clean.
Speaker 1: And, she had taught you how to clean?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So, were you actually one of the people doing the cleaning?
Speaker 2: Yeah, if we were short on someone.  Because I had about ten ladies and men working for me.  And, if we ran short, yeah, I put on my jeans and tennis shoes and I got right on out there.
Speaker 1: How long did you have that business?
Speaker 2: I actually sold the business when we adopted my son [Louis Ivory Edmonson].  So, I actually had it three years, but two years in the shop.  We had had, by the time we had--we ended, we had two vans.  And, someone wanted to buy it, I sold it.  I regretted later, but.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Because of the revenue stream?
Speaker 2: Well, what we were saying, we're adopting this newborn, not newborn, but a new child, and one of us needed to be there to bond with the baby.  You just can't adopt a kid and just push him off to someone else to keep and confuse him even more.  So, my husband [Edmonson's ex-husband, Louis Edmonson] was really the breadwinner, the big breadwinner.  So, he kept on working and I had to give it up.
Speaker 1: When you were a flight attendant, were you the big breadwinner?
Speaker 2: At times, yes.  Yes, at the very beginning, yes I was.  But, as he moved up, then he, he surpassed me.
Story_ID: 650794
Speaker 1: So, you decide, you adopt a child [Louis Ivory Edmonson] many years after you have your first child [Ebony Edmonson Dunn]. How did that come to be?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I couldn't have any more children, so he [Edmonson's ex-husband, Louis Edmonson] wanted this boy.
Speaker 1: Ah, he wanted a boy.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and is he American?
Speaker 2: The child?
Speaker 1: The child.
Speaker 2: Well, that's something I really don't talk about.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's really Haitian, but.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We say he's American.
Speaker 1: I'm only asking 'cause sometimes it's hard to find, even, even African American children, it's not always easy to, to find.  So, you have your business [AT Services (ph.)] for a couple years, then you sell it.  And, some while after that, you decide to go to college.
Speaker 2: Right, then and there, because now I have, one, the baby turned two, we put the baby in, I say kindergarten 'cause it was not daycare.
Speaker 1: Is it like nursery school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --actually learned his ABCs and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --everything else very early.  And, so, I'm saying now, "I just can't sit here and twiddle my thumbs while he's in school," so I went back to school and I got my education.
Story_ID: 650795
Speaker 1: What did you study?
Speaker 2: Psychology.  That was in--from Miami Dade College [Miami-Dade Community College; Miami Dade College, Miami, Florida].  I got an A.A. in psychology (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Which was community college, right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Then, I went on to FIU [Florida International University, Miami, Florida] and got a B.A. in psychology.  And, left there and went on to Barry [Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida] and got a M.S. in marriage and family therapy and mental health counseling.
Speaker 1: So, here in Florida, we're in the Miami-Dade [Miami-Dade County, Florida] area, during that time it was common to do the Miami Dade College followed by the Florida International University, right?
Speaker 2: It was common, yes.
Speaker 1: This was, this was the way you cobbled together--
Speaker 2: That's the way they did it.
Speaker 1: --your, and it's--
Speaker 2: It was not as expensive--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --to do it--yeah.
Speaker 1: It was affordable.  But, interesting that there was, you know, many, many cities and states have the community college the first two years.  But, not everybody has that second two years to kind of back it up--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --at that level.  So--
Speaker 2: So, you leave the community college and you go to the university and you finish up the second two years there.
Speaker 1: And, then you get your M.A. as you say in marriage family therapy--
Speaker 2: M.S., yeah.
Speaker 1: What are you thinking you're going to do?  Why did you chose that field?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know why I chose that field either.  I liked, when I first started at the community college and you take all of these 101 courses, I liked psychology.  And, that kind of guided me through with psychology from--at the community college.  And, by the time I finished that, I liked it so much I just went on and stuck with it at FIU.  And, by the time I finished there, I was into it.  I was just into social services and mental health work.
Speaker 1: Because your, your education, you started in '91 [1991], right, at Miami-Dade--
Speaker 2: You're gonna mix me up with these dates, now (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, but I have them.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, '91 [1991] Miami-Dade, '90 [1990]--you, you, actually that's when you received (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I know I finally--
Speaker 1: That's when you received it.
Speaker 2: Finished in '97 [1997].
Speaker 1: Right.  Ninety-seven [1997] is when you get your M.S.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Right?  And, so, this is, this is one of those interesting careers.  Kind of like, like an athlete, you know, the flight attendant.  So, you finished early.  You're young still.  I mean, you end that career when you're a young women.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, you figure out something else?
Speaker 2: Gotta do something else.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) So, you've, you've now prepared yourself, gone back to school, as you say, when your child [Louis Ivory Edmonson] is going to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  My husband [Edmonson's ex-husband, Louis Edmonson] was, he was, he was making, you know, a good salary.  By that time he's--
Speaker 1: But, were you considering being a homemaker?
Speaker 2: Well, I think I was one during that time.  I would come home and cook and I did the cleaning, and hired somebody to do the ironing because I couldn't iron.  That was one of the things my mom [Florence Smith Downs] never taught me to do.  She did all the ironing and I couldn't.  I would burn myself all over the place.  So, I fi- he finally said, "Just hire somebody to come in and do the ironing."  But, I would do the laundry and finally she started doing the laundry.
Story_ID: 650796
Speaker 1: So, when do you get the bug for entering political office?
Speaker 2: I didn't get the bug until I st- actually started working on some campaigns.  I was in Top Ladies of Distinction [Top Ladies of Distinction, Inc.], so, was two ladies.  One by the name of Carrie Meek [HistoryMaker Carrie P. Meek] and the other by the name of Barbara Carey-Shuler.  And--
Speaker 1: And, what is Top Ladies of Distinction?
Speaker 2: That is also a community oriented type organization, started by Lady Bird Johnson, when she was first lady.  And, she's actually started that in Texas [Tyler, Texas].  We, we worked together and I, I chaired and put on a regional convention that was being held here.  And, just sitting when, I guess the final luncheon after the convention was over, and they attended every- just about everything.  Carrie was getting ready to run for [U.S.] Congress.  Barbara Carey-Shuler--no, she was, Carrie was getting ready to run for state.  Barbara Carey-Shuler was getting ready to run for county commissioner [of Miami-Dade County, Florida] again.  This was back in 1996.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I hope I have that right.  And, we were sitting to the table, I was sitting to the table and Carrie was on one side of me, Barbara was on the other side of me.  And, Carrie says, "I need you to come work on my campaign."  And, Carey-Shuler says, "She's not working on your campaign, she's working on mine.  You already have your, your people to work on your campaign.  Why would you take her from me, when she should be working on mine," (laughter).  So, I ended up working on Carey-Shuler's campaign.  And, Carrie was that same year but later.  So, I went over and helped out a little bit on Carrie's because Carey-Shuler, see you get these names mixed up.  When I say Carrie--
Speaker 1: Well, 'cause they're similar.
Speaker 2: I'm talking about Carrie Meek.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, then there was Carey-Shuler.  I, I worked on her campaign and what she charged me to was to open and close her campaign headquarters, and run the campaign headquarters, and that's what I did.  It was the first time I'd ever done anything like that.  Did a good job at it too.
Speaker 1: So, this is during the time when you are being a homemaker?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: But, that you start--so, you have time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, I would leave and pick up my son [Louis Ivory Edmonson] from school and he'd be right there with me and he was putting together all kind of campaign stuff as well.
Speaker 1: And, your daughter [Ebony Edmonson Dunn] is now, what--was she?
Speaker 2: My daughter is now in college.
Speaker 1: Right.  Where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: Because he, my son graduated first grade while she was graduating from high school, while I was graduating with my bachelor's [from Florida International University, Miami, Florida], all at the same time.
Speaker 1: Where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: She went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Oh, great.  So, you, you open and close her campaign headquarters and run the campaign headquarters?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: It's successful.  Did she win?
Speaker 2: She won, yes.
Speaker 1: And, so, then did you work in her office?
Speaker 2: No.  I'm still a homemaker.  I'm still trying to finish college.  I'm working on my master's [at Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida].  So, that, that right there, I was focused on getting that master's and I, I just didn't wanna work and take away--I needed all my full time to finish college.
Speaker 1: And, you finish in '97 [1997], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  That's when I went to work.
Story_ID: 650797
Speaker 1: And what do you go to work to do?
Speaker 2: In that field.  I started counseling children first; schizophrenics, major depressives, and bipolar disorder.
Speaker 1: Wow.  In the community?
Speaker 2: In the, in this community, yes.
Speaker 1: And, and this is now '97 [1997].
Speaker 2: See, I interned at New Horizons [New Horizons Community Mental Health Center, Miami, Florida].  They liked me, they hired me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, what are, so, you say these, these disorders that you're dealing with, what, what's happening in the community in '97 [1997]?
Speaker 2: What was happening in the community in '97 [1997]?  I don't think there was a whole lot, but you know, a lot--Liberty City [Miami, Florida], you--you're hearing about the fights and children dying, and it was mostly adults then.  But, it's not as bad as it is today.  'Cause today you got, you have children killing children.  That was not as bad but you--the crime had started spiking, spiking up.
Speaker 1: And, it was New Horizons in Liberty City?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And, it's a mental health organization.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, so, you're now, you'd lived in Liberty City when it was very different, right?
Speaker 2: I lived in Liberty City--now, when I was on 69th Street, Liberty City supposedly stopped to the south around 62nd Street somewhere, and didn't go as far as 79th [Street].  When we moved to 51st Street and white flight, all of a sudden, that area turned Liberty City as well.
Speaker 1: So, it expanded?
Speaker 2: Yes.  As the blacks expanded then the whites--
Speaker 1: Liberty City--
Speaker 2: They said, "Liberty City was expanding."  So, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and so, you're, the people, the children that you're treating who are having these difficulties--
Speaker 2: Low income children.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The parents just as bad.  You tried--we had to go visit homes on--we had permission to go into the schools because it was sometimes difficult to actually counsel a child with the parent sitting right there.  'Cause the parent would actually try to tell the child what to say.  That's no good.  Then, once you see that dynamic occurring then you need to leave and counsel the child at the school.
Speaker 1: And, is there a lot of drug abuse in the homes?  What, what kinds of things are you seeing?
Speaker 2: Some homes, but we were there for the children.  We were careful because parents, if you dug too deep or they knew how deep you were digging, they would stop it.  And, that's why I would take the kids out of the home.
Speaker 1: Did you have to do that a lot?
Speaker 2: I did it mostly with the parents.  If they were living with grandparents per se, it was not as bad.  There was a difference.  'Cause grandparents wanted you to come counsel the kids after their, their children messed up the grandkid.  And, that's the way most grandparents are.
Speaker 1: And, and I remember speaking to a psychiatrist in New York [New York].  A women named [HistoryMaker] Dr. June Jackson Christmas in a similar neighborhood in Harlem [New York, New York] during--and her day was a while back.
Speaker 2: Before the Harlem's children zone [Harlem Children's Zone, New York, New York], huh?
Speaker 1: Way before.  Well, she's in her nineties.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But, so, she started a mental health program there and a lot of kids were having some of these same difficulties.  And, she described how the, the children ended up, well, especially in the low income homes really just having no support.
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: Did you find that to be true?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and what I found and that's--I started taking them out on, I would say, field trips, some of the well behaved ones, in a way to motivate them.  Just going to Fort Lauderdale [Florida] to a movie.  It was something big and different for these kids.  And, I would take two at a time sometimes depending on who the children were.  At times, I would just take one depending if that, if that one child was really difficult, and was really having it bad, and we really needed to talk, I would just take that one child.  But, if it's two that was doing well, I would take two.  And, I've spent my own money, doing this with them.
Speaker 1: And, these outings, did you find that it, it--?
Speaker 2: They became more relaxed.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were in awe.  That was obvious, especially if you went to a movie theater or you went to the seaquarium [Miami Seaquarium, Miami, Florida] because most of the times they had never gone to these places.  A museum, they had never seen anything like that before.  So, it was different and you're right here between, right here in South Florida.  Never left South Florida.
Speaker 1: And, did that impact in a positive way, their, their mental health?
Speaker 2: I think it did.  Once I was promoted though, because I got promoted, you get promoted and you have to move on.  And, that's when they put me over the adult daycare centers.  And, that's when I started working with the adults.  How I got into the schizophrenias and major depressives and, and the bipolar, I don't know.  I was just thrust into that.  And, that's where I stayed.
