David Cline: This is David Cline and it is May the 21st, 2010, and I&#8217;m in Clinton, Tennessee.  If you would both introduce yourselves?
Marita Pratt: I&#8217;m Marita Pratt.
Bill Pratt: And I&#8217;m Bill Pratt.
DC: Wonderful.  Let&#8217;s start with you, Marita, if we could.  As I said off tape I wanted to start with a little bit of background about where you grew up and the way that you were raised, and I know we&#8217;ll be talking about church work a lot today so I&#8217;m curious about your church background.
MP: Okay.  Bill and I both grew up in Fayetteville, Arkansas.  I moved there with my family when I was three.  My dad was a piano tuner and my mom was a preschool teacher.  Going to school was very important; going to church was very important; music was very important.  We took lots of music lessons and went to lots of concerts.  This community, talk about a bubble.  It was a small town, college, homey place at that time and everybody that we were in class with went to college.  You just went right on.  Everybody went to church, everybody went to school.  You didn&#8217;t see pockets of poverty like we&#8217;re talking about in Campbell County where we live now.  We didn&#8217;t see that at all.  Fayetteville now, of course, has grown and about ten years ago was one of those top twenty-five places in the United States to live because of Sam Walton and Wal Mart, Jones Trucking and Hunt Trucking, and Tyson Chicken.  They&#8217;ve all expanded that area enormously; big hospitals, lots of doctors, all kinds of opportunities.  It&#8217;s very different.
I received my degree in elementary education and a master&#8217;s in elementary education and I taught in a small school in a local community and then came to Jefferson School in Fayetteville which was the only low socioeconomic school in that area.  That was my first experience with people that didn&#8217;t have much money.  There were children coming to school that smelled like wood stoves--and I hadn&#8217;t had any kind of experience with that--children that came to school hungry.  I taught first grade and I had forty-eight students in that first year that I taught and nobody had had kindergarten yet and there were many, many students who were not ready for school at all and just came to be loved.
DC: Were there resources available for you to use from the school, for the kids who came in hungry for example?
MP: Not so much as these days.  We didn&#8217;t have a breakfast program and so we didn&#8217;t have snacks and extra food resources like we have now so we provided it.  We just did that.  You want to take a turn?
BP: Yeah.  Well, I grew up in Fayetteville and we were Baptists and my father was a mechanic and he graduated the third grade, so he was not formally educated but he was very, very, very intelligent and taught himself to speak and write exceptionally well so he used the right verb tense and spoke in sentences and paragraphs.  And he learned that by working on the prominent people in town&#8217;s cars, and he would get a verb that he wouldn&#8217;t know how to conjugate it and he would somehow work the conversation in and figure out how that person used it and remembered it.
DC: Interesting.
BP: Isn&#8217;t that amazing?
DC: Yeah.
BP: Mother stayed home and did not work to any great extent.  And I went to a high school, which was a very good high school, good formal education, taught languages, taught science, taught history, taught classics.  It was a great high school.  Then, like Marita said, we all went to college.  All of us went to Arkansas, or most of us did, because it was cheap.  It was like sixty dollars a semester or some outrageously low figure in the &#8217;60s, so.
DC: What year did y&#8217;all go to college?
BP: &#8217;66 is when we started, and I went to law school at Arkansas then we left and got married, left and went in the army.
MP: If we can back up before you go into army years, I was thinking that I had an interesting experience in high school in the Presbyterian church because I had a youth leader, Robert Franz, who was in the agriculture department at the University of Arkansas--this might have been &#8217;63 or so--and he divided us up and had us go out with a leader to see which restaurants would serve African American people in our community.  And I was assigned to a group that went to the diner on the square, and I will not forget going in and going up to the waitress at the long bar with all the little stools there and saying, &#8220;Will you serve African American people--will you serve black people?&#8221; and she said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.  You&#8217;ll have to talk to our manager.&#8221;  &#8220;Is the manager here?&#8221;  &#8220;No, the manager&#8217;s not here.  You&#8217;ll have to come back.&#8221;  And that was all it was, but that&#8217;s something that very strongly has stayed with me all these years and was very important to me, that some people in this town of privilege would not be served at this little diner.
DC: Mm hmm.  And that was your youth leader that orchestrated those kind of tasks?
MP: Mm hmm.
DC: Yeah.  Interesting.
MP: Okay, go on to army time.
DC: While we&#8217;re on it, I was just curious if there were other things that came up in your churches as you were growing up in terms of these kinds of justice issues or social awareness?
BP: Well the First Baptist Church of Fayetteville was a pretty moderate Baptist church, and the minister was Dr. Hall and he had a good association with the students at Arkansas and cultivated that.  He lost that edge down the road but in the mid &#8217;60s though he found no difficulty with African American, black folks, coming, but I remember that every time a family would come they would always have people sit on both sides of them and in front of them.  It was like, you can come but we&#8217;ll show you where you need to sit.
DC: That&#8217;s interesting.
BP: It was an interesting kind of--.
MP: You should talk about your family, though, and--is it Poog?
BP: Right.  My father--.  At one point in time there was a black man named Poog Bly, and old Poog was the guy that cleaned the cars.  By then my father had moved from mechanic to running a small Chevrolet dealership for a very kind of wealthy man and Poog was the guy that cleaned up cars.  And he somehow caught himself on fire with some cleaning fluid and was on fire and the old man ran out there and pulled him out of this car and rolled him, or whatever, and put it out.  Poog lived.  And he was burned but he got over it--but he was always deeply indebted to my father.  And so when my mother--.  I came along late.  My folks were in their forties when they had me, which was unusual in the late &#8217;40s to have a child in your forties.  She would leave me with Pearl, his wife, so probably I spent as much time with the Blys and at the St. James Methodist Church in Fayetteville as I did going to the Baptist church.  Is that what you&#8217;re--?
MP: Mm hmm.  And I was thinking about what she said.
BP: Oh, yeah.
MP: I mean that&#8217;s just a little sideline but it&#8217;s kind of--.
BP: One of the things that old Pearl said was that &#8220;cratin&#8217;&#8221; is one of the ways we can be like God, when you birth babies--&#8220;cratin&#8217;&#8221;.
DC: &#8220;Cratin&#8217;&#8221;. [Laughs]
BP: The way she said it was like you would spell a crate.
DC: Right.
BP: &#8220;Cratin&#8217;&#8221;, creating just like God.
MP: We had two wonderful black students that we were friends with and one was Louis--
BP: Bryant.
MP: --Bryant.
BP: Basketball player and highway patrolman who got shot in Arkansas.
MP: And then another one, and I can&#8217;t remember the other young person&#8217;s name, but they would come to our youth group and be part of our group also.
DC: Now did you stay involved in the church while in college?
MP: Not really.  Not so much.  We still attended the Presbyterian church.  I was Presbyterian and we still attended the Presbyterian church but were not as involved then.
DC: And when did you all meet?  I feel like this is a key piece. [Laughs]
MP: [Laughs] We tried to decide with my mother the other day whether we went to kindergarten together. [Laughs]
DC: Oh, really?
BP: But it was young, and we started really going together in the ninth grade.
DC: Okay.  That&#8217;s great.  I think my parents are the same story, fifteen, or something.
BP: Yeah, very young.
MP: Very young.  Next?  Where do we go next?
BP: I don&#8217;t know.  Do you want this kind of background?
DC: Yeah, this is great.
MP: You want us to keep going?  Okay.
DC: This is great, and we&#8217;re definitely heading in the right direction.
MP: Okay.
BP: Our next stop was the army at Fort Hood.
MP: In the army, and you were in ROTC to earn a deferment from the draft to go to law school.
BP: [Laughs] So we drove over the road by Harker Heights, Texas, where Fort Hood was.  It&#8217;s the most dismal looking place you&#8217;ve ever seen, --
MP: [Laughs]
BP: --five hundred trailers there all together, and Marita was just, she was just sobbing, &#8220;Where have you brought me?
MP: [Laughs] We had been in Charlottesville, Virginia for awhile for JAG training, so that was nice, but we went to Fort Hood.
BP: For eight weeks, but Fort Hood was different, the biggest army base in the world and more tanks than most cities have cars, but it was a great time.
MP: And actually it was our transition to Knoxville because Bill worked for an attorney that came back to be an assistant district attorney in Knoxville so Bill came with him to be an assistant, so that&#8217;s how we came to East Tennessee.
DC: That&#8217;s how you ended up here.
MP: Yes.  We came here in 1976.
BP: And stayed in Knoxville until the early &#8217;80s and then I moved DAs jobs from Knoxville to Campbell County, which has Claiborne, Fentress, Morgan, Union, Scott Counties, that were all Appalachian mountain counties; all poor, coal mines, strip mines.
DC: So is that when you first--?  I mean did you first become aware of some of the issues of this region--?
BP: That&#8217;s where we learned about poverty.
MP: Oh, my goodness.
BP: You can live in Knoxville all your life and you don&#8217;t know poverty.  You got to be up there in it to know it, and what to do about it and how to deal with folks that--.  You know, poor folks are not bad folks and they really don&#8217;t want your help.  They would like for you to assist them.  They don&#8217;t need you to tell them to build a shed; they&#8217;d like some help building a shed if they decide they need a shed.  That&#8217;s--.
MP: But they don&#8217;t want you to do it for them.
BP: But they don&#8217;t want you to do it for them, but it&#8217;s a real curious deal.  They&#8217;re proud folks.
MP: Before we moved to Campbell County in 1982, I was trying to get pregnant and was unable to and so we decided to start an adoption process, and did.  And it was looking like that would take five years or so, and somebody asked us if we wanted to take a special needs child and we said we&#8217;d do that.  While we were waiting they said, &#8220;Do you want to take a child in foster care?&#8221; and we said, well, we&#8217;ll do that.  So a child became available from Scott County, from Huntsville.
BP: Senator Baker&#8217;s home.
MP: She was--I&#8217;m trying to remember--sixteen months old?
BP: Thirteen.
MP: Thirteen months old, and--would you tell the part about her father?
BP: Oh sure.  Her father was out on bond for killing the mother&#8217;s father at Christmas time, and he got enraged at the mother and broke into her trailer, and on the way in, with a pole that the TV antenna was in--he took that with him--and he clubbed the mother to death and in the process he crushed this child&#8217;s skull.  The neurosurgeon said he popped it out like you would a ping pong ball.  And so from Children&#8217;s Hospital in Knoxville we get this child.
MP: And the only person that had stayed with the child was the grandmother of the father, and so they didn&#8217;t want her to have the child because they didn&#8217;t know what the family situation was going to end up and they didn&#8217;t feel like it was a good placement for an adoption.  So the caseworker went and got the child and we were waiting on the transport ramp from the kitchen, and we got in the car with the child and went to our house, so we had her secretively at our house for quite some time.  And she was like she&#8217;d had a stroke.  The right side of her lip drooped, her arm and leg [on the right side] were both sort of hanging next to her, and so we started physical therapy and speech therapy and occupational therapy, and this was April, maybe May, and then by the Fourth of July, or the end of August maybe, she had started to walk again.  She had been walking before this accident and she started walking again and she had about fifty words that she spoke, and she had been talking prior to this.  And we had her five months and it turned out that the father&#8217;s sister married a Department of Human Services worker in Scott County and they petitioned for the child.  And because we hadn&#8217;t had her six months we didn&#8217;t get to keep her, because we&#8217;d just had her five they were awarded custody of her.  And we really thought we were going to get to keep her, just adored her.  So then--and we have not seen her but we have heard that she&#8217;s doing well.  She lives in a small town southwest of Knoxville and graduated from high school and is doing well.  She&#8217;d probably be thirty-one,--
BP: Yeah, she&#8217;d be the kids&#8217; age.
MP: --thirty-two now.  So then if one child is wonderful then we&#8217;ll just take two with the next step.
DC: [Laughs]
MP: So, [Foster Care asks] do we want two boys that are five and six or do we want two boys that are two and three?  So we choose the two boys that are two and three because they&#8217;re a little younger, in hopes of getting the best choice there.  And Isaac is age three and Stephen is age two and Isaac is real dark skinned and blondish hair and Stephen is fair as can be and red headed, and they&#8217;re supposed to be related somehow. [Laughs] They are half brothers.
BP: Same mama.
MP: Same mother, and so when we moved to Campbell County we moved with this little three-year-old and a two-year-old, and we still have them in foster care.  As soon as we get into Campbell County in October they come and say they have an adoptive child for us.  And by now we&#8217;re realizing that we obviously have bit off more than we could chew with these two and we say if we decline this child will we get an opportunity to adopt later and they said no at that time.  So we said, okay, so they send us to Kingsport and we go to Kingsport to visit Georgette and take her out for the day, and she has cerebral palsy, but they don&#8217;t know what she has.  She has some kind of--.
BP: Leg problem.
MP: Leg problem, they say.  They don&#8217;t really know.  So, of course we visit with her and take her out for the day and have a nice afternoon and come back the next day and load her up and bring her home. [Laughs] So she&#8217;s two and a half, so now Stephen has turned three and Isaac&#8217;s not yet four and Georgette&#8217;s two and a half, so we have these three like triplets in our home that are all under the age of four and by the middle of that summer we adopted all three.  The father and the mother gave up rights to the boys and then Georgette was adoptable so all three children became adoptable.
Now, the important part of the children in our story is that each of them have such interesting issues that help us be understanding of every kind of person.  Isaac is probably a fetal alcohol syndrome child.  He has very good days and some very bad days where he doesn&#8217;t connect things too well.  Not real bright; he&#8217;s done amazingly well.  He&#8217;s thirty-one.  He lives with us and his wife is an LPN and they have two boys.  The boys are bright and wonderful.  Isaac, we were his ninth home by [age] three.  He&#8217;s also determined--.  We learned as we went along that he was biracial, that this wonderful brown skin and beautiful hair came from his father, who was black, so we have a great story about that, but I want to say a little bit about each of them at this point.
Stephen, fair as can be and red hair, always having problems through school, always having drug problems once he gets to that thirteen age, has been in youth detention or jail, prison, until a week ago last Wednesday, most of his time since he was fourteen.  Finally diagnosed as bipolar/schizophrenic.  So then we have all of that that we followed all these years, and now we&#8217;re getting some diagnoses of bipolar and schizophrenia in younger people, but at the time that we were going to counseling and visiting our psych people they were not giving that diagnosis and waiting until they were older.
DC: So he wasn&#8217;t getting that treatment.
BP: Right.
MP: So there&#8217;s all of that, and then Georgette, we took her to the orthopedic doctor and she definitely had cerebral palsy, legs only, and her knees pointed in and her toes pointed in, so we did a surgery to rebuild an ankle at one point; we did a surgery that turned out both legs and put plates in.
BP: Broke her legs and turned her feet out.
DC: Right.
BP: They probably don&#8217;t do that now but they did it in the &#8217;80s.
MP: The thing that we learned though was that--.  I had people visit me in Campbell County saying that you&#8217;ve got to come to the CP of East Tennessee radiothon, so this was Cerebral Palsy of East Tennessee.  So I took Georgette there and she was walking, and she&#8217;s a kind of tiptoe walker, and we went down to the mall and walked in and here were all of these children with cerebral palsy lined up against the wall, in their various contraptions where they&#8217;re strapped down.  Of course Georgette is obviously--.  I know that she&#8217;s a lot better off than any of these kids but at that point I determined that we&#8217;re not going to label her CP of East Tennessee.  I mean we&#8217;re supportive of this through the years but she&#8217;s going to--.  I&#8217;m going to just work--
BP: Mainstream her.
MP: --as hard as I can to mainstream her and do as much as she can do.  So here&#8217;s this person with physical handicaps, and I think Campbell County is--.
BP: I&#8217;m turning on the air conditioning.
MP: Okay. [Laughs] I turned it down a little bit.  I think they tend to want to grandize the physically handicapped person and they kind of want to set them aside, and you can&#8217;t really do anything and accomplish anything.  I think that it was hard for Georgette because she was always made kind of special which kind of made her not really work real hard sometimes too,--
DC: Interesting, right.
MP: --so we had to--that balance.  So anyway, here&#8217;s Georgette with a physical handicap, Stephen with his mental handicap, and we forgot to mention that in Campbell County there are probably ten black people total.
BP: It&#8217;s pretty white.
MP: So here&#8217;s Isaac, who&#8217;s not black or white, biracial, which is another area of prejudice during this time period.  So I think that growing up with them, as they grew up, and learning how to understand all the things that were going on with them in the community that we lived in, helped--.
BP: Hell, they&#8217;d bring people home.
MP: [Laughs] Helped us be--.
BP: There&#8217;d be folks on the side of the road, you know, and they&#8217;d show up at our house.  We&#8217;d feed them or put them up or give them a few bucks and get them going.  It was just--.  When I was a kid we lived near the railroad tracks and the people riding the trains would come and my mother would always feed them.  I thought that&#8217;s what everybody did and I would tell people that and they&#8217;d look at you like, surely you didn&#8217;t do that, but that&#8217;s what we did.  So taking care of these folks is kind of what you do, I guess, what we think you ought to do, I guess.
MP: Where do we want to go from here?  Let&#8217;s think about that.
BP: He wants to know about how you took the church and you meet a need.
MP: Okay.  As the kids grew a little bit and got in school and so on I needed something to kind of get my own identity back and separate myself from them just a little bit, and I started working for the newspaper, a very, very small town newspaper that did everything.  So I was a reporter.
DC: Which town?
MP: La Follette, La Follette Press.  I went out and interviewed people and took the pictures and went back to the dark room, printed the film, made the prints, put it up on the paper, wrote the story, printed that out, pasted that up, and then it went off to be printed into a newspaper.  But I was at the newspaper one day and I had somebody come in who said that she wanted to see me, so Earl out at the front said, &#8220;Well she&#8217;s pretty busy right now; can I take a name and number and she&#8217;ll call you back?&#8221;  She said, &#8220;No, no, she&#8217;ll really want to meet me.  She really does want to meet me.&#8221;  So he came back and told me and I met Beth Hunley.  And she was--I&#8217;m trying to remember--Community Share?  No.  What was the big food pantry that she works for in Knoxville?  I had that down some place but I don&#8217;t see it right now.
BP: I&#8217;ll think of it.
MP: Okay, good.  Anyway, she was working around in the outlying counties starting food pantries and she had heard about me.
BP: Second Harvest.
MP: Second Harvest Food Bank, okay, and she had heard about me, that I had adopted children and so forth, and she thought I would be interested in talking to her.  Well she wanted to start a food pantry in Campbell County and she wanted to do it by getting churches together to start this pantry.  And a week before that time period I had been hiking in the mountains above our town.  The Cumberland Mountains are there and there&#8217;s a trail that travels miles and I&#8217;d been up there and I&#8217;d been looking down at the town and worrying about it and wondering about how things could change.  And I really had determined on that hike that day that the only thing that would bring about change was churches working together.  So we put together a flyer that went out.  We had ten or thirteen or so churches that came together for a meeting and started a food pantry.  Now this is the first time that churches had ever worked together in this community doing anything.  It happens all the time now, but this was probably eighteen years ago and they just didn&#8217;t do that.  There was this little church in this little hollow; there was that little church in that little hollow; they&#8217;d been in those hollows forever and ever with family members, and even the churches in town were very clannish with their families.  There are a hundred and twelve-plus Baptist churches in this county--
DC: Wow.
MP: --and there--.
BP: And there&#8217;s thirty-five thousand people. [Laughs]
MP: And there are two Methodist, one Presbyterian, one Catholic, you know.  You can go down the line there.
BP: But the group that worked together, there were Baptists and Methodists and Mormons and the Church of God.
MP: Catholic.
BP: The Catholic Church.
MP: We were Episcopal and Presbyterian.
BP: So it was a really ecumenical group, and it continues to function in that way.
DC: And being brought together around that issue has--?
BP: Of food.
DC: Does that coalition still get together on other issues then, or did that create a dialogue between the churches?
MP: They did, they did.  They were able to start an influx of clothing somehow, and that came from the Mormons.  They brought in an eighteen-wheeler truck of clothing and it would be unpacked and then passed out.  There were some community gardens that started out of that.  And I don&#8217;t know how many other things are going on now, but a lot of the things that REACHS did I felt like came out of that church experience too, which included a homeless shelter in the projects that was opened by this group that was REACHS, which is a not-for-profit.  You want to explain what they are?
BP: It operates like a not-for-profit department of human services.
DC: And it&#8217;s called REACHS.
BP: It&#8217;s called--yeah.

MP: R-E-A-C-H-S, and all the letters stand for things.
BP: Regional, educational, health.
MP: But they opened a House of Hope and a children&#8217;s shelter and a women&#8217;s shelter and then this homeless shelter too, eventually, and then had a clothes closet, and I really think that the fact that we started this food pantry brought out the need and these other things developed from that.
BP: So the connection is REACHS was a freestanding organization that did black lung treatment and it had a few migrant workers it dealt with, and then it went into mentally handicapped children.  What the church groups did was have this big social ministry, and they continued to do the food, but REACHS has taken over the spin-off things, like there is a battered woman&#8217;s place and it&#8217;s called the House of Hope, and there is a whole program for the mentally handicapped children [and adult children] and it&#8217;s called Bright Horizons.
MP: It&#8217;s a sheltered workshop.
BP: It&#8217;s a sheltered workshop.  And now it has a community health clinic, a CAC so a federally funded community health center, so it can provide medical things.  So, it&#8217;s hard to show that direct line but I would be--.  The church began the idea and REACHS had the money and the organization and the fiscal responsibility to take the government money, the state grants, and put these into active programs.
MP: I was on the board of the food pantry and you were the chairman of the board of REACHS.  It never had occurred to me before now but it was going back and forth between us some too. [Laughs] We began to really understand about the poverty at this time in our county because the poverty levels were such that a third of the county lived below the poverty level and another third lived at the poverty level and one third above that, middle and higher.  Families at school time, when school started, didn&#8217;t have money for food.  That was our biggest time for food because they were spending money on clothes for their kids so there wasn&#8217;t money for food.  We learned about the prejudice against people who need food.  Someone was always saying, &#8220;Well they don&#8217;t need food; they&#8217;ve got on good clothes,&#8221; or, &#8220;They don&#8217;t need food; they&#8217;re driving a big car,&#8221; and so Diane Roberts, who was an employee at the department of human services and also on the food pantry board sat down one week and interviewed everybody that came in and determined there wasn&#8217;t anybody that came in that didn&#8217;t really need food in that week&#8217;s time, and most of those people knew her too so she was a friendly face with them.
But we really tried to treat people with dignity and respect and not turn anybody away and not make any kind of judgment calls of anybody that came in, but there were illnesses, there were deaths in families, there were disabilities, there were addictions, and yes, there were probably welfare system problems that kept people from moving beyond their poverty level.  Campbell County is a coal mining county so there were deep mines at some point and there were hundreds of little communities all over.  You can find where the communities were by the cemeteries that are left, and that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s left.  You can take 62 from Caryville to Royal Blue and there is one little cemetery after the next.  We walked down that road with the governor&#8217;s wife for the House of Hope for a walk to raise money and here were these little cemeteries.  They&#8217;re all cared for, tended, by some family member some place.  All of these cemetery groups, these little town groups, they still have their reunions too of people that lived in these mining camps.
BP: Like at Turley there was the tipple.
MP: Turley and Block.
BP: And Block, there were tipples.
MP: Caskey--.
BP: Chaskey.
MP: Chaskey is one of the towns you might go through if you go to visit June Pyle at White Oak.  But the coal mining then became strip mining and that was mostly machines and so--.  I thought maybe we should talk about that church story and Boomer at this point.
BP: And the strip mining, since the government regulated it and the seams of coal were not too deep or too wide that it became economically unfeasible for the miner to strip a very small area and then reclaim it, so they would wildcat it, and of course then they had no reclamation.
DC: Right.
BP: They dumped the spoil over and it would just decimate the water.  In the early &#8217;80s that was a real problem.  It was a horrendous problem.  I think that has gone away.
MP: Then there were absentee landowners too.  There were these huge companies, some in England, owned a majority of the land, and the people own the little strips along the highways.  They have owned those little strips along the highways with their families for generations.  They don&#8217;t want to move.  They don&#8217;t want to go anywhere.  It&#8217;s home to them.  There&#8217;s no place to work.
DC: The land&#8217;s been spoiled.
MP: Yes, the land&#8217;s been--.
BP: The land&#8217;s spoiled and then the absentee landowners don&#8217;t--.  They have it.  So there was a little church that rented a piece of land from--I think the company was called Copper&#8217;s.
MP: I thought it was Hooper&#8217;s?
BP: Huber&#8217;s.  Well, maybe.
MP: Well, anyway, it doesn&#8217;t matter.
BP: The point being is that Huber&#8217;s were about to sell it and they were going to sell this little church, so we tried to get the people in the community to come and show a big show of support for the company that before they sold the land that they would deed this chunk of land where this church had been for sixty-five, eighty years to these people.
DC: To the community, yeah.
BP: And we had the darndest time doing it.  Our friend, Boomer, was explaining to me why that was.  He said these mountain folks, when they took issue it was usually a mining union issue and they realized that if they joined the union side it would not be unlikely that they might die, so when they joined in they made the commitment that they were in with their life, which means that if they&#8217;re not going to bet it all they&#8217;re not going to have anything to do with it, and I thought that was very, very, very interesting.
MP: I remember specifically going up there with Boomer that day--he was the editor of this little paper that I worked for--and driving off the road at Eagan or Clearfork or one of those little towns, and going back to this church.  And as you went on the road everything had grown up on every side and then you&#8217;d come to a crossroads and there&#8217;d be a road going each direction and you&#8217;d cross that one and you&#8217;d go like three crossroads.  It was set up like city blocks but there was nothing there except green trees and then at the third crossroad you took a left and another right and a left and a right, and here was this church that we finally got to. [Laughs] Do you remember that?  Well this had been that community at some point and had houses or whatever there, and so all that was left here of this community was this little church.  Anyway, and I think we were twenty to thirty there that night when we met talking about what would happen, and I really don&#8217;t know any outcome of all of that.  I know that Boomer wrote some articles about that and I don&#8217;t know--.
BP: Well they kept their church.  They got it done.
MP: They did keep their church?
BP: Yeah.
MP: Okay.
DC: But that point started I guess some of the struggles and difficulties of organizing in these places.
BP: Oh, yeah.
MP: [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs]
BP: Oh, yeah.
MP: Because I was interested in the food life services and the food ministry, Father Nevels at the Episcopal church that we helped to found in Campbell County suggested that I take over a hunger ministry resource team for the diocese of East Tennessee.  Now the Episcopal Church in East Tennessee goes from Kingsport and the upper east area of Tennessee over to Crossville and down to Chattanooga, so we have a third of the state.  And a woman named Janet Davis from St. Stephens in Oak Ridge had been doing a hunger ministry for the diocese for many, many years and was retiring, so I took over and compiled a report on what the churches were doing regarding food pantries and food help.  Then our diocese had a program director named Carolyn Dicer and she had been listening to me talk about the people that lived in our area.  And Harry and Patty Chase, who are one of the names that I gave you, Harry&#8217;s son, Chris, was a priest here at St. Francis in Norris and had suggested when he retired that Harry should go up in Campbell County and nose around and look a little bit.  Well he got up there and he was just incensed by what was going on and the needs of people and children.
BP: Harry&#8217;s an Irishman from Boston.  There&#8217;s no obstacle too big, no problem too complicated, and he goes straight at it at a hundred miles an hour.
DC: [Laughs]
MP: So he and Patty had been talking to Carolyn also about the problems, and then Sandy Elledge--have you met Sandy yet?
DC: Yes.
MP: She&#8217;s on your list?  Okay.  Episcopal Appalachian Ministries.  She had been talking about it and they had been trying to find a place for her to have an office, so Carolyn had us sit down and change the direction of the hunger ministry resource team to the Appalachian ministry resource team, so here&#8217;s where this was born, and it was 1995, approximately.  And so we determined that we would not start developing programs; we would try to connect people and problems with organizations that could help them, that we would be a process--.
BP: Facilitator.
MP: A facilitator of putting people together that could help each other.  That worked for awhile until we got into looking at the need that was there and then all of these things bloomed.  The first thing that happened was a school supply project.  I&#8217;m trying to remember approximately when that started but it happened not long after this got started, so probably &#8217;96 or &#8217;97.
BP: It would have been the school year of '96, and you discovered that they didn&#8217;t have--.  We have so many schools in Campbell County in the mountains that the lunches are all free.  Everybody qualifies.
MP: That&#8217;s right.
BP: The children didn&#8217;t have anything to do school with and the school doesn&#8217;t supply that.
MP: And the parents would spend a lot of time getting clothes together because that had always been the tradition, to buy new clothes for school.
DC: Right.
MP: I never bought new clothes for our kids at school time. [Laughs] I just laid out these outfits that we already had, but we had fairly good clothes and we had shoes.  But their intent was that child will start school with five new outfits and two new pairs of shoes, and so then there wasn&#8217;t money for food or anything else.  So for six years this project grew until they put together six hundred backpacks that they distributed through the schools in Campbell County and we were getting into those [clear] backpacks and so those were--.  They were starting those, and notebooks, and we sent out the needs for our entire diocese, and pencils and paper and everything that was needed came in and it was all compiled at one church and we got all these backpacks and we had a day that we put them all together, and then we had all these vehicles that would transport them and everybody had certain schools that they went to and they were taken to the schools and the schools were expecting them and then they were passed out to the kids.
BP: We did that about six or seven years--
MP: Six years, yeah.
BP: --and now the Ministry of Hope, or somebody else, has taken what--.  They did it in several counties and they&#8217;ve just taken ours with them so that we don&#8217;t do it anymore.
MP: After we got started then it got started with three other local organizations, Mission of Hope, Aid to Distressed Families of Appalachian Counties, and Knoxville Area Rescue Ministries, and so they really developed it in a bigger way than we did and they took over what we were doing.  So it&#8217;s still being done, but that was where we started.  The next thing that happened was there was a daycare center in White Oak, and White Oak is one of the places that you&#8217;re going if you&#8217;re going to meet June Pyle, and it is the most remote place up on this mountain.  And Tilda Kemplen had a daycare center there in the--
BP: &#8217;50s.
MP: --&#8217;60s and &#8217;70s, because she came to Erin [Presbyterian Church] while we still belonged to Erin in Knoxville.  And it was most unusual.  This was not at a time when daycares were as important as they are today, but she wanted to see the children in this area educated and so she wanted to start this daycare to start their education earlier, like a preschool program.  This building was abandoned and the Methodist Church purchased it &#8211; and that&#8217;s Red Bird [Missionary] Conference in Kentucky -- and then Jim Hudson at St. Martin&#8217;s in Chattanooga had built McDonalds all over the Southeast and he would take his work crews to Haiti to build churches and he was getting tired of--
BP: Going to Haiti.
MP: --going to Haiti, getting older, and he wanted some projects closer to home.  So he took on Tilda Kemplen&#8217;s daycare center and restructured it into four rooms with bunks, bathrooms, an industrial kitchen, and a dining room for a dormitory for work camps.  So the Methodist Church bought the building, the Episcopal Church provided the labor to transform it, and we had a big dedication ceremony.  There is such a great need for help remodeling homes in the area, because people don&#8217;t qualify for Habitat [for Humanity] homes and they don&#8217;t qualify because they don&#8217;t earn enough.
BP: They don&#8217;t make enough money to pay on a note.
DC: Oh, wow, right.
BP: They&#8217;re too poor for Habitat.
DC: Okay.
MP: Okay.  And then there is this huge--.  We learned through the Woodland [Community] Land Trust--and that&#8217;s Tonia Brookman.  She&#8217;s another one I mentioned to you about.  We learned about houses being burned and that there were at the time no firemen, no fire trucks, nothing like that in that whole area, so if your neighbor got mad at you the ultimate was they burned your house down.  We would hear over and over again about these houses being burned down, and especially at Roses Creek.  At the Woodland Land Trust we would hear about these houses being burned down.  Now I did notice when I was doing some background work on the Web for this interview that Eagan does have a fire station now, and I know that White Oak has one too, on the corner there when you go in, but this was a big issue about homes too.  But there was a great need for people to come in and help.
So when we went in to look at this dormitory this was the scripture on the wall, Isaiah 43:19, &#8220;See I am doing a new thing.  Now it springs up.  Do you not perceive it?  [With emotion] I am making a way in our desert, streams in a wasteland.&#8221;
So now, let&#8217;s see.  I want to tell you about--.  We talked about these students.  In White Oak School there were fifty-nine out of sixty-two students on welfare assistance.  We were talking about that just a little bit.
BP: Free lunches.
MP: Okay, and so the person who was running the dormitory was Jim Stevenson and he said what would happen is in the fall he would take applications or he would go out and pass out applications or people would just stop in, and around the first of the year he would have the committee look over all the applications and then he would go out and visit.  If home renovation was needed, like a room addition or a porch added or windows or a new roof, he would figure out how much that would cost and what was needed and then he&#8217;d put the information on the Web, on the internet, and then groups around the United States would check a project.  They would earn the money for the materials and their trip and their food and then they would send the money; he would buy all the materials and have them delivered to the site; and he was then the overseer of what happened for the work camp, and it worked great.  He said that the first year he had five hundred and thirty-five campers working on homes in the area.  He had campers come [from] as far as Indiana and Kansas.  He said one of the projects for the summer was to help a family with a three-year-old daughter.  [Quoting from a document] &#8220;The father had started a porch and soon thereafter was diagnosed with colon cancer.  We&#8217;re going to pick that up and also add a room for the little girl and fix the leak in the roof.&#8221;  So that was an example of the kind of stories of what happened there with the dormitory.  So then Appalachian Ministry Resource Team watched this process, helped with the dedication, planned the ceremony.  Our little Episcopal church, St. Clare&#8217;s, took food up one Sunday and a worship service that we had on two--.
BP: [Whispering] Saw horses.
MP: Saw horses and boards, and we had a regular Eucharist service and then had potluck lunch for the people that were working that weekend, so there were all kinds of ways that people were involved.  And people would come up and work on the roof, or people would come up--.
BP: From the area.
MP: Yes, that&#8217;s true, the area residents and also people from churches in our area.
DC: Now the people whose homes you&#8217;re working on, are they in general religious folks?
BP: Sometimes they were, sometimes they weren&#8217;t, and none of them were Episcopalians.
DC: [Laughs] Right.
BP: So it was--.
MP: Some of these hundred and twelve Baptist churches that we&#8217;re talking about, they&#8217;re up there in this area, so they--.
BP: And so they were promising their communicants, but it was just the example, I guess, of walking the walk rather than talking the talk.
MP: We were trying to get our churches to see that there were some extreme areas in our backyard.
BP: Similar to Third World countries.
DC: Right.
BP: Fifty miles away.
MP: We hear about urban areas that are in great distress but we just have no idea what&#8217;s going on here.  So we were really trying to get that out.
DC: How successful do you think you&#8217;ve been in spreading that message within your own church?
MP: We&#8217;ve been successful.  We&#8217;ve been very successful, and I&#8217;ll show you that before I finish.
DC: Okay, okay, alright. [Laughs]
MP: One of the next things we did was we decided to have a pilgrimage and so we had our group go on a pilgrimage and then we selected other people around in our area, in our diocese and in churches that we knew had similar interests, so we would invite them, so we might be thirty or so to go on a pilgrimage.  Our very first pilgrimage went to visit this White Oak dormitory that was now finished and then the Parent Resource Center in White Oak where June Pyle is and then over to the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange where I mentioned that to you too.
DC: Yeah.
MP: And that is--.
BP: In Jellico.
MP: I&#8217;m just trying to remember the--. [Laughs] For some reason those names keep--.  This has been hard for me because--.  Oh, Wanda Perkins.  I have kind of been out of this for about five years so I had to go back and really dig to remember the stories and get all the names together for you.  So we visited the dormitory, the Cumberland Mountain Parent Resource Center, and then we went over to the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange.  And I won&#8217;t go into the stories that I have about those two because you&#8217;re going to talk to them and they&#8217;ll tell you those stories.  June Pyle just has really a center for parents and for children just covering everything from drug and alcohol prevention, Appalachian team leaders, computer labs, summer programs, anyway, on and on and on, and she&#8217;ll tell you about that.  At the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange Wanda Perkins, she said, [Quoting from a document] &#8220;&#8216;I know where these people are coming from.&#8217;  She dropped out of school at the age of sixteen and had three children by the age of nineteen.  &#8216;God uses us as utensils.  He knows that if I knew I would be better able to help people in the community.&#8217;  Perkins tells of a time when her goals changed from feeding her children and paying her electric bill to getting a driver&#8217;s license, a GED, and her college degree.  She describes herself as &#8216;mother to a lot of women.&#8217;&#8221;
So she started the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange to take care of other women who were battered.  She talks about how they would come in just beat up and she would take them to the doctor or drive them to Knoxville to the hospital, give them food, help them with electric bills, take care of their kids.  The story goes on and on, so there is a story about how women have helped women.  I think the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange has been there twenty years or twenty-five years now.  I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s that exactly, but since you&#8217;re going to talk to her you&#8217;ll hear about that.
DC: And Bill, you were saying something I think before we started the tape about how these really are matriarchal communities.
MP: Yeah.  You should go back to that.
BP: Well, the husbands generally--and of course a generalization is always tough, but women do the work.  Women hold down the jobs and the men do not necessarily provide great child care.  They have other extracurricular activities that are, some illegal and some because they&#8217;ve been hurt so they&#8217;re incapable or they take painkillers to quell the pain.  And so the women provide the money for the family in many instances, and many times they don&#8217;t drive.  No one has ever taught them or they&#8217;re not allowed to so the husbands take them to work and pick them up.  And so if they lose their car or their car breaks down that cuts off their resources.  It also stymies these females because they&#8217;re like indentured servants in many instances.
MP: The third place that we visited on the first pilgrimage was Crazy Quilt in Newcomb, Tennessee, and Brenda Lay was the head of that at the time and when we did that in the late &#8217;90s it had already been in existence twenty-seven years.  [Quoting from a document] &#8220;She said the Crazy Quilt was started with a donation of a box of diapers.  That clothes and household items were sold at reduced prices and hand sewn items attracted the most attention. She said, &#8216;My heart goes into the craft program.  My grandmother is a quilter.  She&#8217;s seventy-six years old.  The Crazy Quilt provides a place for thirteen women and two quilters to sell their crafts.&#8217;&#8221;  And there was a double wedding ring quilt in deep reds and greens that hung in the back on a divider and all kinds of other hand sewn crafts.  &#8220;&#8216;We have a following,&#8217; she said.  &#8216;When the children come from the day they&#8217;re born until they&#8217;re grown they call us &#8220;aunt&#8221; or &#8220;mama.&#8221;  If anyone in the community has a need or problem they call Vicky Stevens &#8220;the befriender.&#8221;  &#8216;If we can&#8217;t meet the need I get on the telephone,&#8217; says Vicky, &#8216;and we&#8217;ll get free [57:50 coal] baby formula, help with electric bills, and so forth.&#8217;&#8221;
So now the Crazy Quilt burned at some point and I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s been rebuilt.  That&#8217;s been a number of years ago.  But this organization and the Clearfork Community Institute were both started by nuns, and they came to the area and stayed and worked with the people.  Both of these women left their order.  I don&#8217;t remember the name of the woman that started the Crazy Quilt but Marie Cirillo is still the person--.
DC: Right.
MP: She still lives in Clearfork.
DC: Okay.
MP: And is an incredible spokesman.
BP: A friend of the Kennedys.
MP: Yes.
DC: I know a little bit of the story of that order, the Glenmary Sisters, and the group that they started afterwards, FOCIS.
MP: Right.
DC: It&#8217;s a fascinating story.
MP: Okay, so then the second pilgrimage that we took, which was a year later, was to the Woodland Land Trust and Tonia Brookman, and Clearfork Community Institute with Marie Cirillo, and so you&#8217;re going to meet with both of them.  The funny thing about the Woodland Land Trust at Roses Creek is one of the first couples that we met and were friends with when we moved to Campbell County had moved from Minnesota, from St. Cloud, down to work with Marie and lived in a house without any water or electricity or anything for a couple of years and had two children there and then moved to La Follette and then we got to be friends at that point, so we had a connection with that mountain area earlier that grew at a later time.
Then the third pilgrimage we went to Henderson Settlement, which is Frakes, Kentucky, which is just over the line there.  Go from Eagan back on this dirt road.
BP: Over Fondy Mountain.
MP: [Laughs] And you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re in the middle of nowhere, you couldn&#8217;t possibly be in the United States, and here is what&#8217;s called Henderson Settlement and it is part of the Redbird Missionary Conference of the United Methodist Church.  And so we invited Bishop Sauls from the diocese of Lexington and his canon, who was Johnnie Ross, to join us on that trip, and then we learned they have dormitories there for work camps and all kinds of community services and a big community building, so this is just like two valleys over from Marie Cirillo&#8217;s but here&#8217;s another whole group of people in great need.  We also went to Morristown, Tennessee, northeast, and Cleveland, southwest Scott County, and Johnson City on different pilgrimages.  The Episcopal Church has something they call jubilee centers.
DC: Mm hmm.
MP: Are you familiar with that?
DC: I am, yeah.
MP: Okay.  They were created at a general convention in 1982 and established as a new era of work for the Episcopal Church at that time. [Quoting from a document] &#8220;Jubilee was mandated as a ministry of joint discipleship with poor and oppressed people to meet basic human needs and to build a just society.  And currently there are over four hundred and three jubilee ministry centers in the church, and these centers are dedicated to improving the lives of the poor through programs of outreach, evangelism, empowerment, and advocacy.&#8221;
So after we had taken these pilgrimages then the Parent Resource Center in White Oak and the Mountain Women&#8217;s Exchange in Jellico were named jubilee centers and so through that there was more opportunity for the leaders to get training--.
