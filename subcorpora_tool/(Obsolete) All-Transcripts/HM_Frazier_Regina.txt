Story_ID: 656625
Speaker 1: Okay. Now before we get--go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask that are kind of a warm up and they only require a short answer.  First one is: do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: Lobster.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A favorite color?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Christmas.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Almost anywhere international.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes, see and now I'm thinking about the first one I had but I need to get the current one and the current one is that, "Service is the price you pay for the space you occupy."
Story_ID: 656626
Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask about your family history--
Speaker 2: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] side but we'll start with your mother's side--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's full name is Frances Edna Reeves Jollivette Chambers [Frances Reeves Chambers].  That's spelled, F-R-A-N-C-E-S, E-D-N-A, R-E-E-V as in victory, E-S, C-H-A-M-B-E-R-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is November 13th or was November 13, 1921 in Miami, Florida.
Speaker 1: Okay now what can you tell us about your family history on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace them and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: My mother's family migrated to the United States from the Bahamas and her father and the other children were all born in the Bahamas.  She was the only one born in the United States.  They arrived here in 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  And do you know what motivated their move from the Bahamas to the U.S.?
Speaker 2: Well my grandfather was a printer and he came to the United States to go to New York to buy a printing press.  He stopped in Miami.  He knew someone here and he never got to New York.  He decided this was the place to move his family and he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Henry Ethelburg Sigismon Reeves [Henry E.S. Reeves].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so he stayed here in Miami and the family settled in the, what they call the Overtown [Miami, Florida] now?
Speaker 2: Overtown right and he founded The Miami Times--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a weekly newspaper that is still published today.
Speaker 1: That's the oldest continuously published black newspaper in Miami, right?
Speaker 2: It is.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So are there any stories about the Bahamas at all, about life in the Bahamas?
Speaker 2: You know there are stories.  I don't know if I can relate them accurately.  I know that prior to my grandfather's arrival here there was a a--Cooper [ph.] was the name I recall on a slave ship that--and the, the woman, the Cooper named woman saved the captain's daughter and was given her freedom and let off in the Bahamas.  So that would be one story.  There's also a story that relates to our Haitian heritage and we are related to people of Haitian descent, one being King Christophe [Henri Christophe] of Haiti.  In fact I named one of my son's Christophe [Robert Frazier]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in his memory and he has a button from Christophe's uniform.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is, this is really something.  Christophe was I guess in terms of the kings of Haiti, he was the grandest.  He built the, the Citadel [Citadelle Laferriere] and the San-Souci Palace [Sans-Souci Palace] and he was the big, the big king of Haiti.  There's a street we were just in, we were just in Opa-locka [Florida]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --on Roi Henri-Christophe Street [sic. Roi Henri-Christophe Boulevard; 135th Street] just a few minutes ago.
Speaker 2: I didn't know they had a street with that name in Opa-locka.  That's interesting.
Speaker 1: There is yeah, Roi Henri-Christophe.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'll have to look for it.
Speaker 1: King Henri-Christophe Street and there's also a Dessalines Street [ph.] too somewhere here in Miami--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --near Virginia Beach [sic.] but yeah so this is interesting.  So yeah Christophe there's a play called 'The Tragedy of King Christophe' [Aime Cesaire] King Christophe by--oh boy I can't think of the author but there's a play about his life that a French author wrote that--
Speaker 2: I'm not aware of that.  I'll have to read it, yeah and give it to my son too.
Speaker 1: So people in the--who wrote in the 1950s what they call the, in the negritude movement of French literature--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --wrote a lot about Haiti and that time period--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and Christophe was a--
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Story_ID: 656627
Speaker 1: Okay so this is, yeah so this is interesting, so he [Frazier's son Robert Fraizer] has a button off of Christophe's coat, yeah.  'Cause Christophe [Henri Christophe] was either killed or died suddenly or something and I can't remember which, (unclear) that he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can't either.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But he had before he died, he arranged for six thousand passages for African Americans to go to Haiti and Richard Allen and others, other black leaders here, actually brokered those passages and filled ships with people and they used all those passages--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah under Boyer [Jean-Pierre Boyer] who succeeded Christophe so that's just a footnote.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Any rate that's a big deal related to Christophe. So a button from Christophe's coat.  And how does it come down in the family as a, I mean--
Speaker 2: It comes down verbally you know because there is also a relationship to Anna Julian [Anna Johnson Julian].  I haven't delved into these as deeply as I might but now I know I have to.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the book is 'The Tragedy of King Christophe.'  The play is by Aime Cesaire.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah Aime Cesaire of Martinique.  So anyway that's quite a story so, so your family they were somebody in the Bahamas I guess because of this kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Right.  I think there's the first, I don't know if I should say first, there's an Anglican bishop there.  In fact there was a reunion.  The reunions in my family are few and far between.  I'm aware of two.  This one I'm talking about now and one about thirty years ago that was in Miami [Florida].  But the one in the Bahamas was very interesting to meet people I had never, never met before and perhaps we'll do it again.  That would be great.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So he [Frazier's maternal grandfather, Henry E.S. Reeves] comes here and he founds The Miami Times--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and so your, your mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] grew up in those days when Overtown [Miami, Florida] was really the heart of black Miami?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Does she have any stories to tell about growing up?
Speaker 2: My mother's deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she--
Speaker 2: She shared many things with me and she was exceptionally protective.  I led a very, very, very sheltered life and so did she you know.  So she came by it honestly.  We were very close and almost, almost like sisters and we did just about everything lock step.  I got to a point in my life when I realized that I wouldn't have them forever so I was gonna have to try to back away a little bit so that I could make decisions on my own because I found she never told me the wrong thing that I should do.
Speaker 1: And that's unusual these days because so many daughters have conflicted relations with their mothers for some reason or another.
Speaker 2: Well you know she was only what twenty-one, twenty-two years older than I am so it's stood to reason I think.  Now young people are not so young when they marry and have children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Now so did your mother, now she went to college right?
Speaker 2: She did.  She was a graduate of Bennett College in North Carolina [Greensboro, North Carolina] and she did graduate work at NYU [New York University, New York, New York].  She actually had everything but her thesis completed for her doctorate--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and she decided she just didn't wanna do it.
Speaker 1: So what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She was a, an educator.  She taught first grade and then she taught Spanish at one point and she became principal of an elementary school.  So she was--plus she did a lot of volunteer work in the community.  She set a good example for us.
Story_ID: 656628
Speaker 1: Okay now she [Frazier's mother, Frances Reeves Chambers] would have been like one of the first ladies of black Miami [Florida] in those days I guess with her--
Speaker 2: She was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) her husband [sic. Frazier's maternal grandfather, Henry E.S. Reeves] being the editor of--the publisher of The Miami Times (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.  She in fact, when she got married she was introduced to her husband to be by the person who was ultimately my godfather and, and my godmother and the rest was kind of history you know.  But what happened was my father was a fisherman and by--his hobby was fishing, let's put it that way.
Speaker 1: Well let's just go to your--can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His full name was Cyrus Martin Jollivette, Sr. [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.],, C-Y-R-U-S, M-A-R-T-I-N, J-O-L-L-I, V as in victory, E-T-T-E, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is October 3rd, 1919.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Baldwin, Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now once again, what can you tell us about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: His grand- his mother was named Regina [Regina Conner Jollivette] and his father was Frank [Frank Jollivette].  Frank was a plumber and Regina was a housewife.  They had six boys and all of the boys when they had a girl, named the girl, the first girl Regina.  One of the most disconcerting moments in my life was my attendance at my grandmother's funeral when the priest kept invoking God to allow Regina Jollivette to rest in peace.  It sounded as though I was attending my own funeral.  Another interesting thing about, I have to throw my mother back in here for a minute, my mother died on my father's birthday, which, which I think is is interesting.  My father died on January 20th, 1960.  He was on a fishing trip with his good friend Scottie [Essex Scott].  Scottie was a member of The Ink Spots which was a singing group of the time, and there was anoth- another gentleman who was I can't remember his name right now, he was the manager of the theater that was located next to my father's drugstore [Community Drug Store, Miami, Florida] and they went out fishing and they never were able to find them.  The boat or just they were just gone.
Speaker 1: So when was this?
Speaker 2: That was January 20th, 1960.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  All right.  So well, we're talking about your father's family so he's from Baldwin, Louisiana--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and did he talk about what it was like growing up in Baldwin?
Speaker 2: Oh, he took us.  Oh definitely.  I mean we--by then, by the time we were young kids, his parents had moved to Port Arthur, Texas, and we went to Port Arthur at least twice a year.  Generally I think Thanksgiving maybe and during the summer.  And that was always interesting because the house was around the corner from the church, the Roman Catholic church.  We had a very religious family and it was across the road from some oil fields.  So that was always a, a fun trip.  Now we would--when we got to Port Arthur, we would go and visit other members of the family in places like Lafayette, Louisiana; Jeanerette, Louisiana; Baldwin.  I'm not sure which of those cities or towns my grandparents were born in but people didn't stray too far.  They all kind of there pretty close together.  In fact on one visit, we were out on this farm and this huge animal started running after me and being a city girl it was so big I thought it was a cow.  Actually it was a hog.  Now I don't know who else mistakes a hog for a cow, but I certainly did.
Speaker 1: They can get big.  They can get big (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it was big yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah they, you know if you haven't seen them before that--I mean a hog can grow to be four hundred pounds, five hundred pounds, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 656629
Speaker 1: Yeah, so at any rate so, so you used to go and visit and so--
Speaker 2: And his brothers would come here to visit.  You know of the six boys, two came to Miami [Florida] and four went to California.  And of the two that came to Miami the--my, my father's brother was he went to the [U.S.] Army and he also helped put my brothers, my father [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] through school.  Then my father helped put him through school so they worked together as pharmacists in my father's store, Community Drug Store [Miami, Florida] which was here in Miami on the corner of Northwest 15th Avenue and 68th Street.  Now when they built this building, it had a second floor that was supposed to be two apartments but my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] was ready to move out of her parents' [Rachel Cooper Reeves and Henry E.S. Reeves] house.  That's where, excuse me, we had been living so we moved in over the drugstore.
Speaker 1: Okay now where did your dad go to school?  I mean as far--
Speaker 2: He went to Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: Right.  That is still known as a school for pharmacists.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay so he went to Xavier.  Did his brother go to Xavier too?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And they were, my father was very active in this community.  At that time there was an organization that had the, the black pharmacists, physicians and dentists in one organization back in, in the '50s [1950s] and early '60s [1960s] and he was the president elect at the time, he died (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that like the National Medical Association?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was, he was president elect of the state group when he died.
Story_ID: 656630
Speaker 1: Now let, let me ask this: is there a story about how your parents met or how they fell in love?
Speaker 2: They met from an introduction of the--okay this pharmacist in Miami [Florida], Elmer Ward [E.A. Ward], called or wrote to Xavier University [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana] and told him that he wanted a pharmacist.  He needed a pharmacist and they sent him my father [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.], and he and his wife introduced my father to my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's, that's how they met and that's how they married.  It couldn't have been, it couldn't have taken them very long to get married because they got married in--on December 2nd, 1942 and I think he may have finished school in June of '42 [1942] or June of '41 [1941] so it was you know they were pretty fast getting there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --getting married.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they met and fell in love, got married and--
Speaker 2: So then when we were about I was about six maybe, which would have been '49 [1949] we moved from Overtown [Miami, Florida] to Liberty City [Miami, Florida] and Liberty City is where the pharmacy was located.  It was called Community Drug Store [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And that's how I moved from going to Dunbar Elementary School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School; Paul Laurence Dunbar K-8 Center, Miami, Florida] for first, second and third grade and then going to, beginning in the fourth grade, I went to Holy Redeemer Catholic School [Catholic Charities Head Start, Miami, Florida].
Story_ID: 656631
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanna go back a little bit and ask you this question which I always ask.  When you think about your parents' personalities, their interests, their talents, what they look like, what they walk and talk like, sense of humor, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I'm an amalgam.  My mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] was a lady and a major volunteer in this community.  I consider myself to be the same.  My father [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] was a workaholic and a pharmacist and I you know both of those describe me so, but I'm a, I have a, very probably I'm an alpha type personality is that I'm a perfectionist which makes life difficult when you're a perfectionist.  You know you get to the point where you realize you can't possibly be perfect but that doesn't necessarily stop you from trying.  So I continue (laughter), I continue to try.
Story_ID: 656632
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter). Now do you have, you, you have brothers and sisters I know--
Speaker 2: I have one brother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) I've met one of each.
Speaker 2: --and one sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I've met them both. Tell us something about them now and where do you all fall in the line?
Speaker 2: I'm the eldest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They love to describe me as their older sister.  But you know it does not bother me because you either get older or you don't, so I'm happy to get older and my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] always taught me that, "I will tell you my age, but not my weight." And so I live by that, that adage as well.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So who comes next?
Speaker 2: Then my brother.  My brother was three years later.
Speaker 1: Okay and his name is Cyrus too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was Cyrus M. Jollivette, Jr. [Cyrus Jollivette, Jr.], and then my sister was seven years after he was born, or nine years and fifty-one weeks after I was born and that's, excuse me, Cleo Leontine Jollivette [Cleo Jollivette].
Speaker 1: Okay, now I know your brother's a lawyer right and?
Speaker 2: Well he considers himself I think a corporate executive or retired corporate executive who does a bit of consulting.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And your sister, what is she?
Speaker 2: My sister is retired.  She's been disabled for a number of years.
Story_ID: 656633
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest childhood memory is the day my brother [Cyrus Jollivette, Jr.] was christened and in our family we always had christening six weeks after birth, so I can kind of pin down you know he was born August 5th so that would mean it was in September toward the end of September in 1946. And my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] promised me that I could hold him after the christening and she went back on her word.  She decided that a six year old could not hold a six week old.  And I was so upset.  I mean I was pouting, I was crying and there's a picture somewhere that shows her holding him and me looking very upset.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah. So that would, that would be the earliest memory.
Story_ID: 656634
Speaker 1: Your family lived in Overtown [Miami, Florida] at first right? And you said you lived above the pharmacy [Community Drug Store, Miami, Florida] in?
Speaker 2: Well that was after we moved to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That was in Liberty City [Miami, Florida] okay.
Speaker 2: Liberty City, yes.  See my father [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] worked for Elmer Ward [E.A. Ward] at Economy Drug Store [Miami, Florida] when we were--
Speaker 1: I just saw his picture in one of the books.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: I remember the name Ward.  I saw his picture--
Speaker 2: He was--he lived to be a hundred.
Speaker 1: Did he?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So I was just thinking that I went to, I went to nursery school in Overtown and it was a program and the woman Mrs. Analee [ph.] is in the book.  She had a program that was a vocational effort to teach high school girls how to take care of children and so it was like a lab and, and I attended that at at Booker T. Washington Senior School [Miami, Florida] and I remember when I was playing I was not allowed to go outside.  My friends could come over on the front porch and we would play through the screen door.  I remember that part too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay so Booker T. Washington nursery school--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and?
Speaker 2: And then Dunbar Elementary [Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School; Paul Laurence Dunbar K-8 Center, Miami, Florida] where my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] was a teacher and my aunt was a teacher.
Speaker 1: So is Dunbar Elementary in Overtown or?
Speaker 2: It's in Overtown.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the schools, were the schools in Miami [Florida] segregated then?
Speaker 2: Absolutely (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) I have to ask but I want you to say it.
Speaker 2: Surely you just, you know.
Speaker 1: I, I kind of know but, but you know we ask people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah they were.
Speaker 1: --so they can tell the story of it because you know it's not general.  A hundred years from now it won't be general knowledge that it was.
Speaker 2: Listen it's not general knowledge today and that's one of the reasons we've been writing these books so that kids will know where they came from.  They have no idea.  I have people who are absolutely shocked when they find out that the junior college was segregated when it opened here in Miami.  Yeah, so we need, we need to tell them and yes, we were segregated but there was also an opportunity to meet students of other ethnicities.  There was a group called NCCJ the National Conference of Christians and Jews [National Conference for Community and Justice].  It's now called M, as in man, CCJ, I think is the Miami Council of Christians and Jews.  I may have that incorrect.  But we had students from all over the county that met together on a regular basis and there was an award that was given to adults in Miami which was the, oh gosh now I can't--the Silver Medallion [Silver Medallion Award].  It was for they gave one to a Catholic, one to a Protestant and one to a Jew every year and it was given to people who made tremendous contributions to the community.  Well instead of the Silver Medallion for the students, they had the Bronze Medallion [Bronze Medallion Award] and I was fortunate enough to win the Bronze Medallion my senior year [at Miami Northwest Senior High School, Miami, Florida] and I'll never forget who the speaker was.  It was Carlos P. Romulo who was the perhaps the prime minister [sic.] of the Philippines came in for that, that speech but they still do that Silver Medallion every year.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a national organization--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it has changed its name and I'm not sure what it is right now but it, it was the National (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, here in Miami it's MCCJ yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, National Con- Conference of Chr- Christians and Jews.
Story_ID: 656635
Speaker 1: Now in--can you describe--now you were in Overtown [Miami, Florida]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --until you were six you said right?
Speaker 2: About six, yes.
Speaker 1: And then you moved to Liberty City [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now where is Liberty City in relationship to Overtown?
Speaker 2: It's about a fifteen minute drive.  In Overtown I lived at 1949 Northwest 5th Place, and in Liberty City I lived at 1500 Northwest 68th Street so you see it's really not that far.  It was the, it was the roads that made it that took a little time in in getting around.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we lived that was a business street.  15th Avenue was a business Street.  We used to call it when they paved it we called it the boulevard.  That was just our--I think it was our family's personal joke about where we were.
Speaker 1: Okay this is the Liberty City--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay.  All right.  So okay so the pharmacy [Community Drug Store, Miami, Florida] was below and the family lived in--on top for a while right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] would cook dinner and then she'd say, "Run downstairs and tell daddy [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] dinner's ready."  So we had dinner together every day.
Story_ID: 656636
Speaker 1: What are some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Some of the sights and sounds and smells of what?
Speaker 1: Growing up?
Speaker 2: Of growing up?  Oh wow, well, I always wanted to be a dancer so I took dancing lessons every week for years and years and years, but my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] did not consider that to be an appropriate career even though I had taken a little of everything.  We had a, we had a dancing school that was run by a woman from New York who put on shows and I loved those shows.  The other, when you talk about sounds, I think about The Miami Times, which was next door to the drugstore [Community Drug Store, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And the printing presses every week you could hear the printing presses going but after we had been there a short while, you know you got used to that sound you didn't hear it any more.
Speaker 1: Now that's interesting because a lot of papers I know now don't print their own editions--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and even in those days a lot of black papers shopped their actual printing out.  So when people think you have a paper they think that you're doing everything.
Speaker 2: Well my [maternal] grandfather [Henry E.S. Reeves] was a printer you know so that's what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So that's, so okay, so that was the business strip of Liberty City [Miami, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Miami Times--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you had the pharmacy there--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --there had to be a--
Speaker 2: And the theater was next to that.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the theater?
Speaker 2: Wow, not--I think it might have been the Liberty Theater [ph.].

Speaker 1: Okay and then, when you were growing up did they, they had the stage shows as well as the movies and--
Speaker 2: I don't think they had stage shows.  They had movies, but you understand I couldn't go there alone.  I mean I had to be, on the rare occasions, I had to be escorted by an adult and then across the street there was a, a funeral home, Raines Funeral Home [ph.] which is still operating today.  There was a dental office.  There was--it was just a business strip.  Now if you went over a block to the, what direction is that?  I'm getting confused.  It must have been a block to the south and across the street were the projects and I--
Speaker 1: Give us the name of those?
Speaker 2: --Liberty Square housing [Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the big thing at Christmas was that it seemed like every kid in the projects got Union 5 roller skates [Union Hardware No. 5] and they were out skating and so I wanted Union 5 roller skates to go out skating but I wasn't permitted to do that and--
Speaker 1: Did you feel--were you kind of sheltered as a child in terms of--
Speaker 2: Exceptionally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exceptionally, exceptionally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I only went to those places that my parents [Frances Reeves Chambers and Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] considered appropriate and I only went when I was chaperoned by my parents or another relative or maybe a very, very, very good friend of the family.
Story_ID: 656638
Speaker 1: So you were at Dunbar Elementary School [Paul Laurence Dunbar Elementary School; Paul Laurence Dunbar K-8 Center] and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --This is in Overtown [Miami, Florida], then when you moved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Overtown, that's Overtown.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but when you moved what school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Holy Redeemer [Holy Redeemer Catholic School; Catholic Charities Head Start, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right Holy Redeemer.
Speaker 2: Now Holy Redeemer opened with the first four grades and, and it opened with the first four grades because I was in fourth grade and my father [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] was instrumental in establishing that school because he wanted his children in a Catholic school.
Speaker 1: Now, is your father Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now is he what you would call a Creole from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From Louisiana yes.
Speaker 1: The name Jollivette, French name though?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm sorry I didn't ask that earlier.
Speaker 2: No problem.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So then every year they added a grade.  It's like they had it in for me you know, but I know it was his influence, and at one point they determined that they wanted to send me to boarding school and I just, I just didn't even wanna hear that.  I had no interest in boarding school and I told them if they sent me to boarding school, I would be gone from their lives forever because after boarding school, there would be college, then there would be marriage then you know, so anyway they didn't send me to boarding school ultimately.  They just--I begged to go to public school because in parochial school we wore uniforms and I thought that was just horrible.  The kids, my friends that I had in public school thought we were having color day the first day we wore our uniforms until somebody said, "No, it's not color day, it's every day.  Those are their uniforms." Not realizing that years later you know everybody it seems would be wearing a uniform, yeah so I was so happy to be in public school because I had had some experiences, not a lot, but it made me a part of why I'm so outspoken.  I know there was, I remember the nun, the mother superior at the school, one they used to love to ask, "How many boys wanna be priests when they grow up? Raise your hands." You know and all the hands would go up and, "How many girls wanna be nuns? Raise your hands." And the hands would go up, and they look at me, "Don't you wanna be a nun?"  I said, "No, I don't."  Said, "Well what do you wanna be?"  I said, "I wanna be married."  So you know then we had a program where we were researching, this must have been '40 [1940], say around '55 [1955], we were researching the church's chronicles to write a program and I'm reading this thing and I cannot believe it.  In there there was a passage that said, "The little darkies look so cute in their white dresses and red capes as they went caroling in Liberty City [Miami, Florida]." So I had to make an appointment with the principal to call her on it and demand that she remove that.  It would be interesting to see if it was ever removed.  I don't even know if they still have those books.
Speaker 1: So you were only twelve?
Speaker 2: Yeah, twelve but you know I was always taught that I was an individual and that I had an opinion and if I had an opinion it was valid and it ought to be expressed.  So when the school reached its twentieth or thirtieth anniversary I went over there and I saw the mother superior.  She came back for--I was in shock.  This was a woman who looked like she was six feet to me because of her attitude, and when I looked at her I think she's like 4'10" or something and I couldn't help myself.  She said, "Hello."  I said, "You're so short."  She said, "How are you?"  I said, "You're so short." You know and that was the end of that interaction but I have always spoken up for myself.  Sometimes I'm wondering how I manage to speak up and still breathe you know but I speak up nonetheless.
Story_ID: 656639
Speaker 1: I imagine you were a good student in school, is this true (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was.  I was valedictorian of my high school class.  I was not valedictorian in college.
Speaker 1: Now let's not get there yet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But Holy Redeemer [Holy Redeemer Catholic School; Catholic Charities Head Start, Miami, Florida] was elementary school right?
Speaker 2: Holy Redeemer was--
Speaker 1: Or did it go--
Speaker 2: --was fourth through ninth.
Speaker 1: Okay and then where did you go?
Speaker 2: Then I went to Northwestern Senior High School [Miami Northwestern Senior High School, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was in heaven.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any favorite teachers in grade school?
Speaker 2: In grade school it would have been Ms. Thompson [ph.] who was a good friend of my mother's [Frances Reeves Chambers] because I wouldn't be in mother's class room so I was with Ms. Thompson and Ms. Brown [ph.].  I loved my teachers all the way through.  The only one I had a problem with was when I was at Holy Redeemer, with the mother superior.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay so you were glad to get out of Holy Redeemer and?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah out of the uniform, you know that.
Speaker 1: So at Northwestern Senior High School, now were you involved in clubs in high school and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: I was.  You know they had a--I've always thought this was funny.  They gave a test for the Betty Crocker award and I won it.  So I guess I was definitely planning to be a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Well you win that, you won the bronze medal.
Speaker 2: I won the Bronze Medallion [Bronze Medallion Award] from MCCJ [Miami Council of Christians and Jews].  I was a member of the Honor Society [National Honor Society].  I'm trying--I ran for, I ran for president of the student council and I lost.  The class told me they thought I should be running for Ms. Northwestern but you see I wanted to be president, but I ended up being president of the state student council.
Speaker 1: Now did a male win the presidency in high school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was another female?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: But you won the presidency of the state student council?
Speaker 2: Right.  I remember my campaign slogan, "You won't regret a vote for Jollivette [HistoryMaker Regina Jollivette Frazier]."
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was disappointed too because the outgoing state student council president got to go to the White House conference on youth [White House Conference on Children and Youth] and I said, "Wow, why couldn't I (laughter) be the outgoing." But things you know, things happen that way.
Story_ID: 656640
Speaker 1: Okay now Civil Rights Movement's heating up all over the country when you're in high school [Miami Northwestern Senior High School, Miami, Florida] they--basically, '57 [1957] Montgomery (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) More so when I was in college 'cause I went to college in the fall of '61 [1961].
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah it was but you know I'm saying starting--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I guess Montgomery Bus Boycott in '56 [1956], '57 [1957] and as we go forward things are really and certainly in '61 [1961] it was really jumping--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --you know so on through '65 [1965] I guess.
Speaker 2: Well I called my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] and I told her that I was gonna take a ride, the ride down Route 40 [U.S. Route 40] and that was--
Speaker 1: Now this is when you were at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Okay, you wanna back up to high school?
Speaker 1: Yea, let's back up and finish high school.
Speaker 2: I wasn't--I didn't personally experience any racial issues but I didn't understand that I was being protected you know.  I didn't understand for example that when we went to Texas, we left at night and we drove all night and reached Tallahassee [Florida] where my parents [Frances Reeves Chambers and Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] had friends at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and we would stay in the guest houses there overnight and then get up the next day and, and move on to Texas and there was a--they put a potty in the car so we didn't have to stop at any filling stations and we had, my mother would have food so we could eat without stopping and so, but I was protected I didn't, I didn't understand so it was always there I just didn't know that the discrimination was as rampant as it was.
Speaker 1: Did your parents have a copy of 'The Green Book' ['The Negro Motorist Green Book']?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't know if they had a copy of 'The Green Book' or not.  There is, there's a friend that they had in Mobile [Alabama].  I can't think of the name.  You would know the name if I, if I called it.  They had a motel there, but what's so interesting about 'The Green Book' is that my girlfriend gave me a copy of 'The Green Book' for Christmas last year and I've enjoyed reading it, plus I saw a piece on TV about it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I didn't, I didn't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay, this was a book that was like a guidebook for black travelers--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --especially families traveling and let them know where they could stay and where they couldn't--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --where they could get gas and that sort of thing because the country was so segregated and volatile, some places were just volatile.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  You had to be careful.
Speaker 1: Yeah so especially traveling through the South, so.
Speaker 2: Well you know my husband [Ronald Frazier] and I were traveling from--this is right after we got married, so this had to be '66 [1966], '67 [1967], we were traveling to, to Texas and we--from D.C. [Washington, D.C.] and we went through Arkansas.  It was Kings Land or Kingsland I don't know the correct pronunciation, Arkansas [Kingsland, Arkansas] and I needed to stop at the ladies room.  So we pulled into this filling station and there were men sitting around the cracker barrel you know I mean this I said, "Wow, this is something I read about in books, I never seen this before."  So I asked them, I said, "I, I need to use your restroom, where is it?"  And they said, "Oh, the pump is broken."  I said, "Well that's all right, I don't wanna drink it, I just want to urinate in it."  And then I turned around and walked down and when I told my husband he put his foot on the gas.  He said, "Do you understand that they will bury us in Arkansas and nobody would ever, ever hear of us again."  I said, "You're absolutely right."  And that's what I mean when I said earlier that sometimes I do things that are ill advised but I feel that you're ill advised to try to take my rights away from me.
Story_ID: 656641
Speaker 1: So in high school [Miami Northwestern Senior High School, Miami, Florida] now when you, you said you were valedictorian?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you graduated all right, and who were some of the--you named a couple of teachers but who, who else was in high school with you that you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh I remember Senora Donaldson [ph.].  Senora Donaldson taught Spanish that's why we called her that, and she was the first day of Spanish III.  First of all I didn't want to take Spanish you know but my, my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] said if there is any chance you will be living in Miami [Florida], you must take Spanish and I wanted to take French.  That was oh romance language, so beautiful.  So I took three years of Spanish from Senora Donaldson and she, the third year, she walked in the class the first day and she said, "Good morning class, this is the last Span- English you will hear me speak." And I said, "Oh my goodness." And then we had a, we had a midterm I guess and the question on the midterm or the instruction on the midterm was to write your autobiography in Spanish and I said, "Oh my goodness." Have you ever seen an autobiography in the first person, the entire time it was in the first person you know.  I am Regina Jollivette [HistoryMaker Regina Jollivette Frazier].  I have seventeen years or sixteen years whatever, I thought it was funny I thought I had, I had really gotten around that one I was able to write my autobiography all in the first person.  Then there was, oh there was this this teacher was something else.  She was, she was very good.  She was very strict, Miller--Newton, Newton Maxwell, Dorothy [Dorothy Newton Maxwell].  I can't remember if it was Newton Maxwell or Maxwell Newton.  She taught honors English and she was a killer you know but she--but we learned.  She taught us and we learned, yeah.  Those, those two are the main ones I remember.
Story_ID: 656642
Speaker 1: Now did you ever write anything for The Miami Times when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: I, I seemed to recall doing some writing.  It might have--no, no you know what it was for the high school [Miami Northwestern Senior High School, Miami, Florida], high school paper.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I did something I don't remember what it was.  I have to go back and pull those, those newspapers to know.
Speaker 1: So what other--
Speaker 2: But I did you know you just reminded me I did write an article, I went to a press workshop or a journalism workshop at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and one of the competitions was to write a feature story and I wrote the feature story and I won first place for it so and you know got a nice plaque or trophy or something.
Story_ID: 656643
Speaker 1: So now your [maternal] grandfather is, is lionized and you said there's a park named after him [Henry Reeves Park, Miami, Florida].  What, what are your memories of your grandfather?
Speaker 2: He was kind I thought.  He was I remember he took--he had nine grandchildren and he took all of us on a cruise to Nassau [Bahamas] to introduce us to that side of the family and that was so memorable that--
Speaker 1: How old were you, I'm sorry how old were you then?
Speaker 2: At the time I was seventeen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But you know there were what six below me, maybe eighteen but there were, there was six below me and that was a very interesting trip.  The thing I also remember is that his daughter, one of his daughters died and you never think of a child dying or you generally don't think that you're gonna lose a child and his hair turned white virtually overnight when, when she died.  I remember he was he was at the traffic court and the judge told him that he thought his, his kids couldn't get him to give up his driver's license so they decided to do it through the judge and he told him, "Mr. Reeves [Henry E.S. Reeves], I, I think I want you to turn in your driver's license."  And he said, "Well, okay I'll think about it.  I'll let you know." You know that's just the kind of personality he was and he thought about it and then he sent the license in but he was a, he was a good man, a kind hearted man and I still miss him.
Story_ID: 656644
Speaker 1: Now did, did you attend like, I mean do you remember meeting any of the, any famous people as a result of the newspaper [The Miami Times] being so closely associated with the family, that--
Speaker 2: Well just the family generally.  I remember this is not necessarily through the newspaper.  I remember Sara Lou Harris [Sara Lou Harris Carter] came to our house.  Sara Lou was a model, a very famous black model and we had her to dinner.  I don't remember when Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] came to, I don't know if it was our house or my [maternal] grandfather's [Henry E.S. Reeves] house but there were people all the time.  It just but you know to me they were just people who happened to be stopping by.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because a big deal wasn't made about them.
Story_ID: 656645
Speaker 1: Okay, so high school [Miami Northwestern Senior High School, Miami, Florida] graduation, we were talking about some of the teachers and everything but when--so you were valedictorian of hi- of your class, so is anything significant occur during grad- graduation, that being a big moment?
Speaker 2: Oh it, well there was the valedictory and there was I had to learn a poem also.  This is the English teacher that Dorothy Maxwell Newton, Newton Maxwell--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Dorothy Robertson Newton Maxwell [Dorothy Maxwell Newton].
Speaker 2: --was big at writing productions you know and so she wrote a production for this and one of the things I had to do was recite, oh what is that poem?  'The Day is Done' [Henry Wadsworth Longfellow].  I love it to this day.  "The day is done and the darkness falls from the wings of night, as a feather was wafted downward from an eagle in its flight."  I'm not gonna go and say the whole thing but I loved that.
Speaker 1: Okay and so, now why did you choose Howard University [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Howard gave me a full ride.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: It is a top school.
Speaker 2: Right.  And it had, it had a College of Pharmacy [Howard University, College of Pharmacy, Washington, D.C.].  You see there was my father [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] with the drugstore [Community Drug Store, Miami, Florida], I'm in eleventh grade, he dies. I don't wanna be a pharmacist but my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] says, "Well you've got to pick up this slack." And my brother [Cyrus Jollivette, Jr.] says, "Well you just go on and major in pharmacy and then when I get, I'll major in pharmacy and when I get out, I'll take over the store and you can go on to medical school like you've been talking about."
Speaker 1: Okay, so you wanted to be a doctor?
Speaker 2: At another point I was thinking about being a cardiologist.  And of course he did not major in pharmacy.  Now when it was time for me to go to college my mother was still trying to decide where I should go and I said, "Look, as long as it's out of the State of Florida its fine with me."  I said, "I have been sheltered all my life and it's time for me to kind of get out on my own." And I don't think the final decision was really made until a month or so before it was time to go to school because I remember her saying, "I don't know maybe you should go to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee]," but Fisk didn't have pharmacy and Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] didn't have pharmacy but it was out of the question because it was all female you know and I wanted to go to a school that had males and females.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's ironic that my daughter [Rozalynn S. Frazier] (laughter) went to Spelman.
Speaker 1: So, so you didn't consider Xavier [Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there was no pressure to go to Xavier or any--
Speaker 2: No, there was no pressure to go to Xavier.
Story_ID: 656646
Speaker 1: All right, so Howard University [Washington, D.C.], so 1962 fall, right?
Speaker 2: Sixty-one [1961].
Speaker 1: Sixth-one [1961]? Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because it's a five--at that time it was a five year program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so you start in 1961?  Now this is the year you were alluding to earlier, this is a year of the Freedom Rides and you wanna go on a Freedom Ride in '61 [1961]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 2: So when I announced to my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] that I was going on the Freedom Ride and she said, she said, "Okay, I'll talk with you later." And the next thing I knew she was standing at my dorm door (laughter) and she said, "Let's sit down and talk darling."  And she told me she didn't want me to do that because if I was arrested it was going to ruin my life and knowing that she never told me the wrong thing as far as I was concerned I was obedient and did not go.
Speaker 1: So many, I've heard lots of stories of people who went and parents were very concerned. There was, in fact we interviewed a gentleman named Thompson [ph.] who's in Atlanta [Georgia] now, he's well off in Atlanta.  I think he had a set of drugstores in Atlanta, but he was on the bus that was burnt in Anniston, Alabama, and barely escaped with his life.  So it was more than a notion--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --what might happen to you and what actually did happen so, so you were a freshmen and your mother showed up?
Speaker 2: I think it was my, I don't remember, but I'd have to look back to see when those rides took place.
Speaker 1: Sixty-one [1961], '61 [1961].
Speaker 2: Okay.  So then I was also, there was a steering committee, I cannot remember the name of the steering committee at Howard that consisted of students, faculty and administration and it was convened to address issues of, related to demonstrations and I don't remember how I got on this committee but I was on this committee.  What I remembered most about the committee is that Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] said that anyone who felt that the university was not a base for social action was a handkerchief head so here I am handkerchief head.
Speaker 1: Okay so that actually, so you were saying that students should not be involved in--?
Speaker 2: They should not be demonstrating on campus that's what I was saying.
Speaker 1: Okay, now why were students demonstrating on Howard's campus because I'm sure they had their rights on Howard's campus, so what were they demonstrating for I mean?
Speaker 2: For civil rights.
Speaker 1: Oh you mean, so you mean that the students would leave the campus to demonstrate?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no problem.
Speaker 1: In, in D.C. [Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: It was, yeah it was no problem, or to go to [U.S.] Route 40.  I was saying that actually on the campus that was my opinion.
Speaker 1: Okay so what kind of--what were they demonstrating for on the campus?  Were they contending with the administration over some issues?
Speaker 2: No, it was about the inability to eat at lunch counters or the civil rights issues of the day is what the demonstrations were about.
Speaker 1: Okay I guess what I'm--
Speaker 2: And the question arose should students be allowed to demonstrate for these issues on the campus?  You're not getting it?
Speaker 1: No, I mean I would guess if you were gonna demonstrate you actually do it off the campus.
Speaker 2: Well the campus, I thought the campus was the place to learn, the place to study, the place where it should be quiet and contemplative not the place for marching and shouting.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay so I'm trying--
Speaker 2: So you can go off the campus and do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah so what the school was probably I'm thinking here, correct me if I'm wrong, the school was saying that they shouldn't agitate the students to go off campus to do it?
Speaker 2: No, that's not what they were saying.
Speaker 1: Shouldn't agitate them on the campus?
Speaker 2: It shouldn't be happening on the campus.
Speaker 1: Okay, well I still don't understand why they would demonstrate on the campus when the campus--
Speaker 2: They appointed this committee to discuss this issue and this is what the committee came up with as I recall.  And that's why Stokely called the people on this committee handkerchief heads.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --on the committee himself?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 656647
Speaker 1: Now my other interaction with, with Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] it jumps over to after I was married [to Ronald Frazier] and we, and--Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated and I was working in Washington [D.C.] at the Peoples drugstore [Peoples Drug] and I think Peoples may be CVS [CVS Pharmacy] now at the Peoples drugstore on the corner of 13th [Street] and U Street.  So I'm in there.  I think I was doing an internship at that time I don't think I had my license yet, I'm not sure, Stokely comes in and says, "You better get out of here now." And there was a man in there who was the district manager for Peoples drugstores and there was the store manager.  The store manager had a, I think it was a fourth grade education, but nobody had to tell you that if you talked to him because people believed in having you come up through the ranks, so when Stokely says this the manager looks at Stokely and says, "Shut the F up George," you know and, "let's get out of here," so we closed down the store and we left.
Speaker 2: This is during the beginning of the riots?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Was the store untouched?
Speaker 1: The store was untouched as I recall but not those blocks around 13th and U.
Speaker 2: Okay I know that even during the riots or rebellions or demonstrations they try to spare black businesses if they knew who owned what.
Speaker 1: Yeah the thing is you know when Miami [Florida] had its riots, I told them they hadn't seen a riot (laughter), you know they should have been in D.C. if they wanted to see a, a riot.
Story_ID: 656648
Speaker 1: So now who, who were some of your, I guess, who were some of the other students there with you and who were some of the professors that you remember and leaders at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Okay let me try to think.  You realize I, I had the fiftieth anniversary of my graduation from Howard last year.  Okay so it's, it's kind of hard to--
Speaker 1: Stokely [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] was there we know that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah we know he was there.  There was a guy who wrote a book and I think, I can't think of his name.  I wanna think his--this guy was in my, my speech class maybe 'Manchild in the Promised Land'?
Speaker 1: Claude Brown?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yea, that's written by Claude Brown.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he was in your speech class?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was in my speech class.  We had I think, I think Roberta Flack graduated at some point along there.  I know we went to see her all the time.
Speaker 1: Now she used to perform close by right?
Speaker 2: In the Cavern, she used to perform in the Caverns [Bohemian Caverns, Washington, D.C.] yeah.  Who else?  I think Hightower must have moved on in the, in the [U.S.] military to some rank, [HistoryMaker] Dennis Hightower and also who was the guy he was looking at the, I don't, he got it, maybe he's secretary of the [U.S.] Navy, Togo West [HistoryMaker Togo D. West, Jr.]?
Speaker 1: Togo West, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Of the [U.S.] Army I think, yeah.
Speaker 2: Army, so Togo West.  I, I have to I really haven't given this part a lot of thought you know.
Speaker 1: Now did you join a sorority?
Speaker 2: I did not join a sorority on campus.  I pledged in the graduate chapter here in Miami [Florida], Alpha Kappa Alpha [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].
Speaker 1: Now that's a story probably in this interview I mean why would you, you seem to be an organizationally motivated person, why did you or how did you avoid joining a sorority in college?
Speaker 2: It was easy.  My average wasn't high enough, so there you go.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were actually, were you struggling in college?
Speaker 2: I wasn't struggling.  I was living the life that I had, I had envisioned you know.  I had a social life.  I, I had one grade that brought my, that brought my average down because I had all A's and this, and a D and a D was in a five--I think it was in a five hour course.
Story_ID: 656649
Speaker 1: All right so, so did you settle, kind of straighten out as you, I mean did things become easier?
Speaker 2: I wasn't crooked (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.
Speaker 2: I, I went on and you know and I finished [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and I did my, I did my internship.  I would do a few hours here in Miami [Florida] at Community Drug Store and then I did it in Washington [D.C.] at, at Peoples drugstore [Peoples Drug] and then I passed the, the D.C. boards and I had they move you around to different locations.  Couple of the locations I just, I really didn't love.  For example I had one assignment in a store across the street from the state department [U.S. Department of State] you know and they had like thirty-five prescriptions a day.  I mean my goodness you do thirty-five prescriptions and you read every book in the magazine section.
Speaker 1: Did it help to know Spanish very well?
Speaker 2: No, Spanish didn't, didn't help there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Spanish helped in Miami [Florida] you know and I'm not fluent or, it helped with travel but I could generally understand what you were talking about.  I'm definitely not fluent.

Speaker 1: Okay, so were there any, well back, back on Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] just for a minute, were there any special professors or teachers?
Speaker 2: Well there was, oh gosh, what was his name?  He was young you know.  He was a person best described as, I laugh and joke but I don't play.  He would, I think he, he taught, he taught one of the chemistry classes and he would play basketball with the guys in the class and all that and he'd turn right around and put F, you know.  So and then there was my father [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] was friendly with the dean [Chauncey Ira Cooper] of the College of Pharmacy [Howard University College of Pharmacy, Washington, D.C.], had been friendly, he was deceased by this time and then I think he had been friendly with one of the professors.  That was Roy Darlington [Roy C. Darlington], but I wish I could remember this, this guy's name.  I mean, I, I had some professors that left something to be desired you know, like there was one who came in and he just wrote formulas on the board the whole time and he'd speak for like three minutes and class would be over.  But my favorite, my favorite class was not in pharmacy, it was philosophy and I tried my best to get into, I think his name was Dr. Banneker [ph.], Banker, anyway he had taught my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] and I wanted to take his philosophy course because philosophy just makes sense to me you know.  I, I found it difficult to learn stuff cold.  It had to be logical, that's why I love Dr. Spock so much, or Mr. Spock from it because he's logical.  So if you should show me something that's logical, I'd have it in a minute but if you show me something that just sits out there by itself, it just does not compute.
Story_ID: 656651
Speaker 1: Was there anything special about graduation from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember who our speak- baccalaureate speaker was. Adam Clayton Powell [Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.].  My classmates had to hold me in my seat because he stood up there and you know I told you I always respond.  So he stood up there and told the people, the graduates, that if they had a B.A. degree they might as well throw it in the trash right then, or if they had a, I can't remember, I think he might have said something about a B.S. and I was getting a B.S. in pharmacy so maybe that's what made me want to respond but I definitely wanted to respond.
Speaker 1: So, so in his speech he reduced the, I guess the--
Speaker 2: Degrees to rubble.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So was he going through one of his, I know he had contentious leadership with quite a few people.  I mean he, he had his heroic side, he also had a contentious side.
Speaker 2: I don't know what he was going through but he went through it there at baccalaureate and then you know I don't recall who our speaker was for commencement.  I know we had, I think, an acting president when I graduated.
Speaker 1: It wasn't--
Speaker 2: I know Cheek [HistoryMaker James Cheek] wasn't there.
Speaker 1: So Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.] wasn't there either?
Speaker 2: Nabrit, no.
Speaker 1: Okay and then Cheek hadn't started yet, huh?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think this guy's name started with an S.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it surprised me right after we graduated, the next year the students were taking over the administration building and I was saying, "Gosh where were they last year when I was--." I couldn't believe things had changed that much so rapidly.
Speaker 1: Okay, I know Nabrit was there when you were there, but I don't know about anybody else, you sure, James Nabrit the attorney who was in the law school [Howard University School of Law, Washington, D.C.]?
Speaker 2: When did Nabrit leave?  He must have been there when I got there, but he wasn't there when I left.
Speaker 1: He was there from '59 [1959] to '80 [1980] no well no I'm sorry not--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that's for NAACP Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] but I don't know, I guess not, maybe not but they said that's what the outline says he was there end of the--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 1: --he might have been there for the whole thing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now so you graduated in 19--?
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966].
Speaker 1: Sixty-six [1966] and you got married the same year?
Speaker 2: I did, 'cause that was my plan.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know I did have a plan and it was to graduate in June and then I was gonna go to Europe.  I post- that was postponed.  I didn't go and then I was gonna get married in December.  So I had the plan before I met the man (laughter), you know but I met the man [Ronald Frazier], and lucky me we had our fiftieth wedding anniversary in December.
Story_ID: 656652
Speaker 1: Okay well tell us how you met?
Speaker 2: Well, I used to watch him come into the cafeteria every day and I--well no let's back that up.  Right after we matriculated at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], my girlfriend introduced me to him and he was standing on the sidewalk in front of the cafeteria and I just I said, "Ah ha, I like how he looks.  I'll file him away for future reference." Which I did.  And then he used to come into the cafeteria and stay for a few minutes and leave and I couldn't understand that, and then I found out he was on the swim team and he was just stopping in for a minute before he went to swimming practice.  So I found out that the team, the swim team was going to Baltimore [Maryland] for a meet and I got a ride over there and I watched him and after the meet I went up to him and I said, "Oh, can you help me?  I have no way to get back to campus."  So he got me back to campus and the rest is history.
Speaker 1: All right so you engineered the whole thing?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Smart move.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right and your husband is Ronald Eugene Frazier [Ronald Frazier], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he's an architect and city planner.
Speaker 2: Right.  He's retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so.
Speaker 2: And he's out there I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So you got married in '66 [1966] and did you start a family right away?
Speaker 2: No, my first child was born July 1, '69 [1969] that was Ronald Eugene II [Ronald Frazier II] and he's the second because his daddy said he was not gonna have anybody calling his son junior, so that must relate to some experience he had had in his home of Houston [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Okay so.
Speaker 2: And now there's a third [Ronald Frazier III] who is the son of the second.  But he's only ten years old.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever live in Houston?
Speaker 2: We never lived in Houston.  We lived in Washington [D.C.] right after we got married and it took me until, that was '66 [1966], we got married December 28, 1966, it took me until 1969 to get him to move here.  One of the things that helped was that the long distance phone bills between me and my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] a hundred and twenty some dollars is a lot in 1967 for a phone bill.
Speaker 1: Yeah that's a weekly salary for the average person I guess.  Yeah.  In those days that was their salary.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah it was a lot back then.
Speaker 1: Okay so he figured he'd save money if he (laughter)--
Speaker 2: He figured he could save money if he moved here [Miami, Florida].
Story_ID: 656653
Speaker 1: All right.  So, so what did you do here in, now, oh in '70 [1970] you joined the staff of the University of Miami Hospitals and Clinics [Miami, Florida], tell us how that came about?
Speaker 2: I had--I knew I didn't wanna work retail and as a high school student [at Miami Northwestern Senior High School, Miami, Florida] I was in a program that the public schools had and I was at NCCH, which is National Children's Cardiac Hospital [Miami, Florida].  In fact that used to be the name of my hospital.  It's gone through a number of changes.  I was under the tutelage of Milton Saslaw [Milton S. Saslaw] who was the, I think he was the head of the Department of Health in Miami-Dade [Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County].  He tried to get me to go to Cornell [Cornell University, Ithaca, New York] and I, you know I told him I said, "You must be kidding, Ithaca [New York], you know how cold it is in Ithaca?"  You know I said, "Besides I'm looking for a husband.  It's gonna take too long to find one up there or I might not find one at all."  I was serious about this husband thing as you can tell.  So when I graduated, by the time I graduated college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and moved to Miami [Florida], the university had purchased National Children's Cardiac Hospital and it was located where it's located now.  Previously when I was doing a project there, it was on Le Juene Road and Flagler Street I think.  So when I'm looking through the phonebook I said, "Oh let me try these people.  I used to volunteer here.  I do volunteer work here." And they hired me.  So when they offered me the director position you know when I started there were four of us, my boss who was a pharmacist and two pharmacy technicians.
Speaker 1: Were you the only African American?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what was, I forgot what I was about to say and the pharmacy was just really, really small.  One of the technicians got pregnant, you could hardly pass between the counters there, but anyway when they offered me the job, I talked to my girlfriend and she this is the one who introduced me to my husband to be [Ronald Frazier].  I said, "I don't know if I'm gonna take it.  I don't know if I'm ready for it." And she said, "If you hold the job one day, it goes on your resume, take it."  So I took it and I ended up being there until 2007.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is University of Miami (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) University of Miami Hospital and Clinics, National Children's Cardiac Hospital, UM/Sylvester [UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, Florida].  It's great at changing its name, okay (simultaneous)? (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 656654
Speaker 1: Okay, now what was your position when you came on in 1970?
Speaker 2: I was a staff pharmacist, I think.  I'm saying I think because the university [University of Miami Hospital and Clinics, Miami, Florida] was terrific with titles you know.  I think I went from staff pharmacist to senior pharmacist, from senior pharmacist to director of pharmacy and I guess I just wasn't creative enough over the years because at one time I opined to someone, I said, "Maybe if I change my title to grand exulted director of pharmacy, I could get more money."
Speaker 1: So you became--I have here that you became the director in '73 [1973], is that true?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  I mean it was a big deal you know.  The Miami Herald covered it.  I was in my twenties and so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Well what were--what was the nature of what you had to do and, and--
Speaker 2: As director?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the conditions that you worked in.
Speaker 2: Well, what I had to do was make sure the pharmacy [at National Children's Cardiac Hospital; UM Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, Florida] ran smoothly and that it met all of the legal requirements and that the drugs were there when they needed them.  So it was, make it work.
Speaker 1: Okay so, so many people who are gonna be watching this have never been a pharmacist, can you just walk us through a typical day as a director of a big pharmacy like this for a hospital (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well you know the thing is that every day is different.  It was, when I started I was filling prescriptions when I--or drug orders.  When I ended I hadn't been near filling an order in, in years so when I started the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations [Joint Commission] was just a joint commission on accreditation of hospitals and they had one sheet of paper, I think eight and a half by eleven, that wasn't even covered with writing and those were the requirements for hospital pharmacies.  When I left there was a book about this thick okay, on the requirements so that's why there was something different every day.  I also had the opportunity to serve on the IRB, which is the board, it's the investigational review board [institutional review board] that reviews proposed protocols for the institution that are testing drugs for possible entry into the market.  There were just all kinds of things that you did.  You know there was designing the pharmacy, there was hiring the staff, monitoring the staff, just whatever, whatever it took.
Speaker 1: So this is a hospital pharmacy--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and so the people--
Speaker 2: It had a hospital and it had clinics and it was, it concentrated on cancer therapy after, after a few years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how do you best design that, you said part of your job is designing the facility right?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the ways you do that is by attending the mid-year clinical which is held every December.  When I went to my first mid-year clinical, I think it was maybe the seventh one they had.  There were about maybe twenty five hundred people there.  Now, this year was the fifty-first.  I stopped going after, after I retired and they probably had twenty, twenty-five thousand people there.  So it's the largest meeting in the world and so you get to hear all these speakers.  You get to see all these exhibits you know and you get to one of the most important thing for me was the review of the joint commission new requirements so that I was right there knowing exactly what they were going to, to be reviewing when they came by and I never had a problem ever.
Story_ID: 656655
Speaker 1: I know just in the news these days security is always an issue in terms of pharmaceuticals, especially pain killers and that sort of thing.  Did, did you have to really make sure that?
Speaker 2: Right, that's, inventory control is a part of it as well and I didn't have any problems there [at the University of Miami Hospital and Clinics, Miami, Florida].  I--and you had, you have unannounced visits from various regulatory agencies.  I just, I had the reputation of being an honest person and so that helped a whole lot.
Speaker 1: Now did you ever have people try to get drugs out of the pharmacy that weren't supposed to and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Not when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So nobody even tried it?
Speaker 2: Well they might have, you know I can't, I wasn't all seeing but to my knowledge they didn't.
Speaker 1: Nobody succeeded you're saying okay.  All right.  Okay.  So what--
Speaker 2: But you--I just thought of something.  We had, we had controlled substances, you know narcotics, opioids, out on the units in these containers and nursing had access to these to pull and administer to patients.  I remember one night I had to go in like two or three o'clock in the morning and wear gloves and set up a clean drawer to capture any finger prints and then testify before the board of nursing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So yes, I remember that.
Speaker 1: Did you, nobody, you never caught anybody trying to?
Speaker 2: I didn't.  You know there, there are counts that take place at every shift and then you have to inspect all of the places where drugs are stored on a monthly basis and, you know I'm saying this, I don't know if any of these rules have changed in the last ten years, but that's what they were when I was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're responsible for identifying you know what drug is which right as well?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Being able to--so what are--how is that done because I never been a pharmacist.
Speaker 2: Well there are references.  Many of these drugs have numbers on them and there are references both nationally and internationally that identify drugs so, you, you can do it.
Story_ID: 656656
Speaker 1: What about the price of drugs?
Speaker 2: They continue to just hit the stratosphere you know.  They really are.  There are a lot of people who still don't believe in generic medication you know and you can talk to them until you are blue in the face telling them that it's the same drug, it's just like car and Cadillac, but they believe they got to have that trademark special.
Speaker 1: Okay even--
Speaker 2: But I think the prices are starting to drive people to generics, yeah.
Speaker 1: People don't believe, you know there are so many, especially today there are so many commercials that identify drugs by name on television, attractive ads and that sort of thing, people think if they don't have this name I guess they don't (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well that was one of the practices that I instituted early on, that the drugs had to be written by their generic name so that when a generic came out there wasn't a need to educate people to the new name you know.  The name--the generic name is always the same.
Story_ID: 656657
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're saying prior to your move, drugs were identified by their company nickname or whatev- or--
Speaker 2: I mean I did this years ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: This is, this is nothing new and I'm sure most institutions probably do that now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah and then we went into the, you know, you get into the robotics era and that was interesting.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well we used dispensing machines where in the pharmacy they would input the drug order for the specific patient and on the unit they would withdraw it and administer it.  Now everything couldn't go in there you know.  The IVs [intravenous therapy] were still prepared in the pharmacy and sent to the floors.  But this was so interesting and I--they had a, they had a unit that, I cannot remember the name of, that would carry drugs from the pharmacy to different places and I thought it was so expensive until the salesman said, "Well look at it this way, it works twenty-four hours a day.  It doesn't take vacation or holidays," and you know when you look at it that way, then sure you can pay that price.  I didn't, I never did try to get one of those units.
Speaker 1: So the unit that works in the hospital moving drugs around (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --from one spot to another?
Speaker 2: It's like a little R2-D2 you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Story_ID: 656658
Speaker 1: All right so, so you're director of the pharmacy [at University of Miami Hospital and Clinics, Miami, Florida] for th- for, for six, seven (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A long time, thirty--
Speaker 1: Thir- thirty some years?
Speaker 2: --probably thirty-three something like that years, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had to keep up with all the new--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --literature in the field and the new drugs that sort of thing?  Is there any--was there a time when you thought a drug should have been available that was not or that a, that a drug just cost too much?
Speaker 2: No.  If you wanted a drug on the formulary or if a physician wanted a drug on a formulary, he would complete--he or she would complete an application and submit it to the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee [University of Miami Hospital Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee] and I was the secretary of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee and then there was a physician who was the chair and that committee met monthly and one of the things it did was review requests and say yay or nay so.
Speaker 1: Now who were some of the other head--I mean African American head pharmacists in the country when you were, when you were working?
Speaker 2: We had, I know we had one other woman, African American woman in Florida.  I cannot for the life of me think of her name right now.  There were you know I tell you that first, that first clinical meeting I went to, there were twenty-five hundred people and there were maybe twenty-five people of African descent.  As a result that group formed a new organization called the, oh gosh, anyway it was, it was like a sub organization of the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists [sic. American Society of Health-System Pharmacists].
Speaker 1: Like a black caucus?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they're still operating you know.  I remember we formed it in San Antonio [Texas].
Speaker 1: Okay about what year was it formed?  Was it the early '70s [1970s] when it first started?
Speaker 2: Probably around there.  I just read that not long ago and I, I can't think of what year that was.
Speaker 1: That was the era where so--
Speaker 2: They just, they just had an anniversary so it may be its thirty or forty years since it was, since it was formed and now there are other ethnic groups who've developed their own caucuses.
Story_ID: 656659
Speaker 1: Now you've had a, a rich volunteer life and still have one, so--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --tell us about, about that.  Now you, you've been involved, you became national president of The Links [The Links, Incorporated] which is a big deal in this country.  So what, when, when did you start with Links and what happened?  What was your progression?
Speaker 2: I was inducted in April of 1970 and I went to my--my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] was a Link and that makes me the first Heir-o-Link, H-E-I-R, dash, O, dash, L-I-N-K, which is the child of a Link, the first Heir-o-Link to serve as national president.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I went to the--my first national assembly, which is our deliberative body that meets every other year in the even years and I was just impressed.  I said these women are dynamite.  The things they are doing and I decided to be president at that first meeting in 1970.  Aside from that, my mother and I had a room that was one room removed from the person who was running for national president.  Her name was Helen Grey Edmonds [Helen G. Edmonds].  I had declared myself--do you know who Helen Grey Edmonds is?
Speaker 1: I don't.
Speaker 2: Oh gosh she is a scholar.  She's deceased.  She seconded Eisenhower's [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] nomination back in '52 [1952] maybe, I can't remember.  And--
Speaker 1: So, so she was on the--
Speaker 2: --oh she was--
Speaker 1: --Republican National Committee?
Speaker 2: She was, she was big time.  Aside from being brilliant and having more than thirty Ph.Ds. to her credit you know and so I was busy sticking my head out of the door to see what they were doing, what I could learn from how this this campaign stuff worked in The Links and subsequently we became friends and she was my mentor.  So that's, I just I worked hard you know.  If, if you asked me to do something, I did it.  And I worked my way up through the organization from southern area director.  No, first I was national member at large.  They don't have that, that office any more.  That was an office that was designed to encourage the younger members of the organization to participate in its administration and then I was the southern area director and then I was the national vice president and then I was the national president.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you, you became national president in--?
Speaker 2: Sev- eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-six [1986] okay.
Story_ID: 656660
Speaker 1: Tell us about what are the activities of The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and, and, you know what, what, what did you do, what was your agenda during your term?
Speaker 2: My agenda was to make the, the chain of friendship that encircled the globe not only figurative but literal, and to that end I charted the first international chapter in Nassau, the Bahamas.  Subsequently I charted a second international chapter in Frankfurt [Germany].  That did not survive because it was related to the [U.S.] military people who were stationed in Germany and when that ended, people started coming back to the United States and we could not sustain the chap- not we, they could not sustain the chapter there because it was, it was operative for I would say 1990, 2000 at least twenty years I think.  And then I had the great pleasure of inducting Leontyne Price as an honorary member.  And during my presidency we had four program facets.  We now have five, but we had the arts, services to you, national transcend services and international transcend services and our programs are built around those.  So we had a program called Project L.E.A.D. High Expectations in which we collaborated with other organizations, national organizations like Sigma Pi Phi, Boule, like Jack and Jill of America [Jack and Jill of America, Inc.] for example and this was to stop--encourage kids not to take drugs you know it was a, it had a just say no component to it and we ran a pilot in, I forget how many cities, and at the time that was the largest grant we had.  It would--ended up being about three quarters of a million dollars so those were big programming funds in those days.
Speaker 1: So where did the grant money come from?
Speaker 2: I knew you were gonna ask me that.  I wanna think it was NIDA, which is the National Institute for Drug Abuse [sic. National Institute on Drug Abuse] under NIH.
Speaker 1: Okay, National Institute of Health [sic. National Institutes of Health], right okay--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: And that program is still going today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We call it one of our signature programs.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now you were--you're president from '86 [1986] until when?
Speaker 2: Ninety [1990].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it's a four year term?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well actually at that--things change, you know the more things change, the more they remain the same, at that time it was a two year term and then I was reelected.
Speaker 1: Okay so it's two, two year terms, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 656661
Speaker 1: Is the anti-drug campaign [Project L.E.A.D. High Expectations] your, your--the, your, the, the thing that you're the proudest of with the Links [The Links, Incorporated] or?
Speaker 2: That's one of the things I'm most proud of yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right so you're still a member right today?
Speaker 2: I am still a member, still very active.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you joined the--
Speaker 2: In fact these books are a, a product of my local chapter, the greater Miami chapter of The Links Incorporated [The Links, Incorporated Greater Miami Chapter, Miami, Florida].
Speaker 1: And the books are?
Speaker 2: The books are 'Linkages and Legacies, Volume I' ['Linkages and Legacies: Historical Profiles Depicting Notable Greater Miami, Florida, Pioneers of African Descent, Volume I'] and 'Volume II' ['Linkages and Legacies: Historical Profiles Depicting Notable Greater Miami, Florida, Pioneers of African Descent, Volume II']. We're meeting later this month to see if we have the energy for volume three.  We published 'Volume I' in 2010, 'Volume II' in 2015.  This is a project that my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] began back in the '80s [1980s] and it was worked on on and off for all those years until 2010.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the first volume came out in 2010?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay you were showing me the second volume was dedicated to your mother right?
Speaker 2: No, the first volume was dedicated to my mother, but she was still alive.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The second volume, she is one of the profiles because she is deceased.  This is--when we were doing the first book we had such rich material on so many people that we had to draw the line somewhere so we said, "Okay great, let's do the people who are already deceased.  We don't wanna lose that data," and, and that's how it grew.  So the first book we did fifty profiles and the second book we did sixty profiles.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we threw in some history of Miami [Florida] in the first book and in the second book we added the, the Greek letter organizations in Miami that had been chartered up 'til our celebration of sixty years.  So that had been here at least sixty years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so these are African American people of accomplishment here and from the City of Miami?
Speaker 2: From the greater Miami area, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, greater Miami area.  And what are some of the areas that the book deals with?
Speaker 2: Oh, it covers education, it covers healthcare, it covers individuals in law, in religion in you know what I think there are about seven categories that we have, that we've used and if you're an outstanding individual who is deceased, we'll name a category for you but there were--it was so interesting at first individuals wanting to know, "Well why wasn't I included?" You know and it's just so easy to say, "You're not deceased." And that's the end (laughter) of the conversation.

Speaker 1: Now you joined the AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.] grad chapter too.  You're a member of AKA right?
Speaker 2: Right.  19--December 1974.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you ever hear--hold a national position or local position?
Speaker 2: I did not.  I have--my national positions have been related to The Links [The Links, Incorporated].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's been your primary focus?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And what are some of the other groups that you volunteer for here?
Speaker 2: Well there's Breakthrough Miami, which is a super program that provides experiences for under resource youth.  There ware about twelve hundred students in the program at this point and they start the summer before fifth grade and we take them to college and I mean we've even had a Gates Millennial Scholar [The Gates Millennium Scholars Program].  We have Posse scholars [The Posse Foundation, Chicago, Illinois].  We have some of the schools because our sites are private schools and some of those schools have given scholarships to some of these students, so it's, it's a fabulous program.  I love it dearly.  I'm going to tell you how they hooked me.  They showed me the program and the classroom I walked in was fifth graders and they were dissecting the fetal pig.  I was blown away.  I said, "You got me." You know so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So Breakthrough Miami and what else, what else?
Speaker 2: There's the International Women's Forum which is a--an international networking opportunity that's located in about I don't want to give the wrong number, approximately twenty-seven countries right now that I joined maybe twenty years ago you know.  I joined it at the time when they said, "Listen, we don't do anything, we just network."  Of course things changed you know and get pretty busy.  In fact we have the international president here in our Florida chapter right now and we'll be hosting one of the international meetings in 2018.
Speaker 1: Okay, well now you represented The Links at the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] silent march on Washington [D.C.], right in '89 [1989]?
Speaker 2: I did.  You know I did not go in '63 [1963] and I always regretted it.  I had--I sat in Miami [Florida] and I said should I go, should I not and I had just come home from, from college [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and said, "Oh, I won't go," so I was sorry about that.  So when this march came up I said, "Oh I gotta be there."
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Yea, that's how I got there.
Speaker 1: All right.  Tell us a little bit about it?
Speaker 2: It was interesting.  It was not--there were just peaceful people marching through the streets of Washington and that's my memory of it.  I don't, I don't remember anything of note particularly except the display of how many people were there marching.
Story_ID: 656663
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about police brutality in Miami [Florida] as an issue?
Speaker 2: Well, there is a project, a program that I am working with.  The Children's Trust [Miami, Florida] had a proposal for innovative programming and so we had four groups collaborate to address the issue.  The program is called Art Detectives.
Speaker 1: A-R-K or A-R-C?
Speaker 2: A-R-T.
Speaker 1: A-R-T, Art Detectives, okay.
Speaker 2: Art Detectives and it is a collaboration between The Links, Incorporated Greater Miami Chapter [Miami, Florida], Breakthrough Miami, PAMM, which is the Perez Art Museum Miami [Miami, Florida] and the Dade County police department [Miami-Dade Police Department] and we meet with the kids.  There are fifty kids per session and we're doing six cycles.  So that would be three hundred kids plus the ones we did in a pilot last, last fall.  And what this program is trying to do is provide the oppor- not trying it's doing it, it's providing the opportunity for students to meet policemen, policewomen through art and get to really understand that all of them aren't bad and all of them aren't good and it's, it's been wonderful.  We just finished the, the first cycle of the grant.  It's three successive Saturdays.  And the--I missed the second Saturday on this cycle.  As fate would have it that was the the day we had press day and even The New York Times came down to cover us because of this innovative program.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what's it been like?  I mean are there, is there increased trust between police and the community or, and?
Speaker 2: I, I think I can only speak for these kids and I don't think they like to be called kids.  They liked to be called young people.  They were all young ladies in this group because we were at Carrollton School of the Sacred Heart [Miami, Florida] which is an all-girls school.  They, they are honest to a point.  I think that you know they have to draw what they think the relation- what they're relationship is, how they feel and then they have another opportunity after they get to interact and talk with these police officers.  So it's been pretty beneficial.  What was so interesting to me, there was one young woman who went up to talk about her collage and I said okay you, I didn't even know it was her collage that I found so interesting, and she had her descriptors underneath flip up and they were not all complimentary you know, so I asked her I said, "Well, tell me what part of, of the city are you from?"  She said, "I was, I was born in Liberty City [Miami, Florida] and I grew up in Overtown [Miami, Florida]."  I said, "Okay."  I said, "Guess what?  I was born in Overtown and I grew up in Liberty City."  And she was kind of in shock you know that I would be there in role I was in with that kind of history.  So in those terms I think yes, this program is working.  Nobody is gonna go out and say, "Oh, I'm so in love with the police." But we can see a shift in attitudes through the exposure.
Story_ID: 656664
Speaker 1: Now, what you just described in terms of where this young lady lived seems to indicate a shift in migratory pattern from Liberty City [Miami, Florida] back to Overtown [Miami, Florida]. Is Overtown--
Speaker 2: Well I don't think (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) what's, what's going on?
Speaker 2: --you can, you can say that based on one--
Speaker 1: Okay, but I'm asking is there?
Speaker 2: --one student.  This just this is how it happened one student to be.
Speaker 1: Okay so it doesn't really indicate that?
Speaker 2: No, you'd have to study it to know for sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, so right now the status of Liberty City and Overtown are they comparable or are they (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right now, they are going through gentrification and--
Speaker 1: Both places?
Speaker 2: --Overtown more so than Liberty City at this point, but it's happening in Liberty City as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right so those are two?
Speaker 2: And you know what that means?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: We'll be gone.
Speaker 1: So we may have historical monuments left behind, but there won't be any African American people there, is that what you're saying?
Speaker 2: I'm saying there won't be the same African American people there.  There will be some.  You know what's, what's happened is, I don't know what you know about our city, but we have little, little to nothing okay.  We have an area called the Design District [Miami Design District, Miami, Florida] that is very close to Overtown and now the Design District has the very high end shops you know, very high end and we have so many condos that have developed and, and Brickell Avenue, which is not that far away, which is, which is south of Overtown is practically a concrete canyon now which is amazing to me.  But it's our financial district.  So we got a lot going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In fact they've got a building that's supposed to go up with, I cannot think of the name of this architect that is now deceased, and the exoskeleton is on the outside of the building instead of the inside.  They want it to be a signature building for the city.  It should be ready in 2018.
Story_ID: 656665
Speaker 1: So what, what other, is, is that I mean have we, we were talking about the volunteer activities that you had (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it's just so much you know.   I mean it's too much.  There's the Orange Bowl Committee that puts on the festival every year in, during the Christmas holidays that would be one.  There's the--what else?  I can't even think, you know, I have to look at my resume to know what I'm, know what I'm doing.  But those are, and I go through and there's, there's the sorority [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].  I'm not as active as I could be because there are so many activities with The Links [The Links, Incorporated].  So I go through I look at, I listen to the--and think about the days of the week and when those meetings are.  Because even when you're on a board you know if you're on the executive committee of the board then that's another meeting and then if you're on a committee other than the executive committee, that's another meeting. So just to say the organization really doesn't address the amount of time involved.
Story_ID: 656666
Speaker 1: Now is your, your family, you and your family involved in, in the, in The Miami Times at all?
Speaker 2: No, I'm not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: We interviewed your uncle [HistoryMaker] Garth Reeves a couple of years ago--
Speaker 2: Oh, it's been a couple of years?
Speaker 1: It's been maybe more.
Speaker 2: Really?
Speaker 1: At least a few years ago.
Speaker 2: Well, I been trying to wear him down.  I don't know, did you throw his tape out or what?  Do you still have it?  You know he's, he celebrated his ninety-eighth birthday last month so, so I'll, I'll work on him again.  I'll see what he says.
Speaker 1: Okay and is it, I mean I suppose someone in your family has spent significant time you know dealing with the family history because it's so significant to the--
Speaker 2: Well quiet as it's kept, my brother [Cyrus Jollivette, Jr.] has, you know, he's a virtual motherload of, of information on the family on, on both sides, my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] side and my father's [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] side and I ask him things because I wanna write them down.  I found a book and I ordered a copy for him.  I ordered a copy for my husband [Ronald Frazier].  I think I'm gonna get one for me that tells your life story, you know, it guides you and asks you questions.  I don't know if you've ever seen that book or not but it's very--I'll show you a copy of it before you go.
Story_ID: 656667
Speaker 1: Now you retired in 2007, is that--from your position (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: When you look back on it, what, what would you consider to be your major accomplishments in your pr- profession?
Speaker 2: That I ran that pharmacy with no problems for more than thirty years.  That would be a major accomplishment or the major accomplishment of, of that position.  That's something that you know if you tell somebody nowadays, you tell a younger person, especially a millennial, that you were there that long, well you must not have anything on the ball you know.  You stayed that long?  So when I started working at UM [University of Miami Hospital and Clinics, Miami, Florida] I was, I had a child [Ronald Frazier II] who was a few months old.  I think he was, he may have just turned one and I found out they had tuition remission.  They had external tuition remission and I said, "Well that, I'm not interested in that because I won't be here that long."  Well I was.  I was there long enough to educate three children, courtesy of the University of Miami [Coral Gables, Florida] and they, they had external so it was wherever they went I was grandfathered in on external so I had one at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], one at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina] and one at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  Thank you UM.
Speaker 1: Okay, who were some of your colleagues at University of Miami and you know and that you know interacted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --with and respected you know?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in my position, I remember telling my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] that it was lonely at the top because I was in my department handling what I needed to do and didn't spend a lot of time out socializing.  It was my staff that I was responsible for.  I had the physicians but the physicians couldn't relate on a friendly basis with me.
Speaker 1: I'm not just talking about friendship, I'm talking work.  Who were your close colleagues and?
Speaker 2: Oh well whoever was on the pharmacy therapeutics committee [University of Miami Hospital Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee] would be very close and then there was a, a--the department heads, various department heads that met on a regular basis would, would be very close and it was always hard to see people go you know.  I'm, I'm proud of the fact that there's several people who were on my staff who still stay in touch with me after ten years. I think that's admirable.
Speaker 1: And were you able to mentor any young people then?
Speaker 2: I was, I tried and I think I succeeded in many cases.  I remember I had one young woman who had a couple of kids and she has risen through the ranks.  She became a, a pharmacy technician.  She did--she got her degree from UM.  She went on and studied IT [information technology].  She's in the IT department now.  I had a young man he came for an interview and I said, "Well tell me what your--what are your plans for your life?"  And he told me that he wanted--he was gonna be a physician.  Well he wasn't gonna be a physician because you know he had a high school diploma and I said, "You know you have to be realistic with me.  Are you aware that you cannot go to medical school since you have not been to undergrad?"  That kind of thing so they--I saw a lot of growth in a lot of people.  I, I had one young lady that I wanted to take over after me and she just didn't wanna do it.  She did not want to do it.
Speaker 1: Did she change professions or did she, was she just satisfied with?
Speaker 2: No.  She stayed there.  She wanted to go back to staff.  She wanted to leave administration and go back to staff work because being a director is very, very demanding and people somehow don't wanna, don't wanna do it.  That may have changed now.
Story_ID: 656668
Speaker 1: What did you find demanding about the job?
Speaker 2: Well, there was no, you know, I was on call 24/7 so that's what I found demanding about the job.  It was whatever it took.
Speaker 1: So were you often called and (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not often if they could not reach the person on call and I did, I remember one night when the pharmacists on call did not respond.  The next day I told her I was not amused you know when I, because we weren't open twenty-four hours a day and this was about two o'clock in the morning.  I had to go in and prepare something so.  It didn't happen again.
Speaker 1: So I suppose that when it would, would happen these would be critical moments I guess in somebody's life?
Speaker 2: Yeah (nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You recognize that this is life or death so you have to govern yourself accordingly.
Story_ID: 656669
Speaker 1: Now we always ask this question: when you look back at everything you've done to this, this far--thus far, is there anything major that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I doubt it.  I doubt it.  You know I said I wanted to be a dancer but my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] was smart enough to know that dancing could not sustain me.
Speaker 1: So what kind of dance did you, I neglected to ask you?
Speaker 2: I did, I did acrobatics.  I did tap.  I did ballet.  I did modern you know.  I did all of those.  As a matter of fact when I, when I finished high school [Miami Northwestern Senior High School, Miami, Florida] there was a guy who had a, he was putting together a show on Miami Beach [Florida] and he offered me a part and my mother said, "I don't think so." And that was the end of that so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you kind of regret not dancing, at least?
Speaker 2: Not now.
Speaker 1: Have you danced recreationally?
Speaker 2: You know because it's so short--huh?
Speaker 1: Have you danced recreationally I guess or been involved in anything?
Speaker 2: Listen, I'm seventy-three years old.  I'm not out here dancing recreationally okay.  No.  I haven't danced recreationally.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was like that was a chapter and it was closed except when I was a freshmen at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.], they had freshmen week.  They had a, they had a, a talent show that any freshmen could sign up for and my mother told me you know participate, participate.  That's how you meet people, et cetera, et cetera. So I sign up this, this talent show and I had on a leotard and I had wrapped myself in green chiffon and I was dancing and you know Cramton Auditorium [Washington, D.C.] that's--I was dancing in Cramton Auditorium to, oh heck I can't, it's, I can't think of the music but I was running across the stage and doing aerobics and all and later the man I married when I told him I was the one that was, he said, "You got to be kidding me."  We were--I think they were laughing about the girl in the green chiffon that, that ran across the stage, 'Ben-Hur,' I think I was dancing to the music from 'Ben-Hur' (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh from 'Ben-Hur,' really?
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter), with the crescendos and all, so.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 656670
Speaker 1: Now what, what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: My hopes and concerns are around my grandson [Ronald Frazier III] who is ten years old and what he needs to do to be a viable participant in this, in this world you know and I, I tried to--I'm, I'm torn, I'm torn because my mother [Frances Reeves Chambers] said, "Okay you're not gonna be a dancer, you'll be a pharmacist." And then I have my children and I let my children decide what they wanted to be.  So now with him I'm not trying to decide for him, but I'm trying to present him with opportunities and say you know, "You ought to take a look at this, this is interesting," or, "you ought to take a look at that."  Not you will be.  I mean his parents, I don't know what they're telling him but that's what I'm telling him and, and I worry about that.  I worry about where our country is at this point in time.  I mean when you have leadership that lies to you on a regular basis, then you can't believe anything.  I worry that a button will be pushed and that'll be the end of it and nobody will have to worry about anything, but you know life goes on and you have to move on like there is a future and I certainly hope there is one.
Story_ID: 656671
Speaker 1: Now tell us about your children and--
Speaker 2: I have three children.  The eldest is Ronald Eugene Frazier II [Ronald Frazier II].  He is married.  He has a ten year old son [Ronald Frazier III] whose birthday is December 31st.  So you know I tell him the world celebrates his birthday of course.  And his father, when he was born called him a tax baby.  I hate that term.  So and his wife has a, I think he's twenty-two, has a twenty-two year old son, so I have a twenty-two year old step-grandson. And then I have my middle child, my middle adult, Robert Christophe Frazier [Robert Frazier].  He is single and I'm hoping one day he will get married.  I think he will, but you know it's his life and his timeframe.  And then those are--they're both financial analysts, one with B/E Aerospace [B/E Aerospace, Inc.; Rockwell Collins, Inc.] and one with Citrix [Citrix Systems, Inc.].  My daughter [Rozalynn S. Frazier] is a fitness editor, the fitness editor for Health magazine in New York [New York].  She has an interesting, she's also single.  She has an interesting life.  As a matter of fact you know I get these text messages from her, "Just want you to know I'm on my way to ski Mont Blanc [Le Mont Blanc] in the French Alps."  I think that's, where it is in the French Alps.  So that--she, she trained so hard for that.  It's not that I get these at the last minute.  If they're regular destinations they're like press trips.  If they are regular destinations, I might get a few days' notice.  The trip for skiing was she told me the hardest thing she ever did and she actually trained for that and they did, they did a film clip on her.  The magazine did a film clip on her and had a piece in the magazine about it.  So those are my three.
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't discussed that we need to talk about before I ask my--
Speaker 2: There are so many things and I'll remember all of them after you leave.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I don't know if I can send you in addendum or what but--
Speaker 1: (CYRUS JOLLIVETTE, JR):  Let me help.
Speaker 2: Excuse me?
Speaker 1: (CYRUS JOLLIVETTE, JR):  Let me help. You need to put in context the pharmacy for Larry [Larry Crowe]. How big--what it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, the scope?
Speaker 1: Okay there were four people--
Speaker 2: (CYRUS JOLLIVETTE, JR):  No not numbers, dollars.
Speaker 1: Okay it was $150 million business--operation when I left--
Speaker 2: That you were in charge of?
Speaker 1: --when I left with forty, forty staffers.
Speaker 2: That's big.
Speaker 1: (CYRUS JOLLIVETTE, JR):  That's what administration in a pharmacy--you wouldn't, you wouldn't think that (unclear). And, and my niece Roz [Rozalynn S. Frazier], her youngest child, you didn't say she's a marathoner.
Speaker 2: Oh right she's a marathoner.  She used to run marathons in a lot, the New York marathon [New York City Marathon] about five times.  She did Miami [Miami Marathon], she did--
Speaker 1: (CYRUS JOLLIVETTE, JR):  She, she won New York marathon. I saw her across the finish line.
Speaker 2: She won?
Speaker 1: (CYRUS JOLLIVETTE, JR):  As far as I'm concerned she won, I--she crossed the finish line.
Speaker 2: She takes after you in terms of being athletic?
Speaker 1: I am not athletic.  I was athletic as a child.  Now my idea of nirvana is an air conditioned room with a glass wall and beautiful scenery and I do love to travel.  I love to travel.  I've been on six continents and we are planning the seventh if we survive and that would be Antarctica and that's strictly a vanity trip you know.  So you could, "Oh I've done seven continents."  So hopefully we'll be able to do that and I can stay warm enough to do that in February.
Story_ID: 656672
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well the last question is, is this: how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: (Pauses) Wow, I never had that one before.  I think I'd like to be remembered as a person who made a difference.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Story_ID: 656673
Speaker 1: This is my wedding day, December 28, 1966.  And this is the reception.  Shall I go on or is that sufficient?
Speaker 2: That's sufficient, that, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (MATTHEW HICKEY):  (Simultaneous) Could you identify (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Ronald Eugene Frazier, Ronald E. Frazier [Ronald Frazier].
Speaker 1: (MATTHEW HICKEY): There he is.
Speaker 2: I just wanted you all to meet him.  They're looking at you when you were a baby honey.
Speaker 1: (RONALD FRAZIER):  I look just like that now what are you talking about?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: These are boards, my husband, you put this together for what?
Speaker 2: (RONALD FRAZIER):  For her birthday.
Speaker 1: For my birthday.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This one on the left, top left in the yellow gown, that's the day my husband was inducted into Sigma Phi Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity].
Speaker 2: This one, the next one is a night club on Miami Beach [Florida] on our, our honeymoon before we left Miami [Florida].
Speaker 1: The next one, that's December 1974, that's the night I went over at AKA [Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.].
Speaker 2: This top one with my hand, in the gold suit, with my hands up that's when I was elected national president of The Links [The Links, Incorporated] at the assembly.
Speaker 1: And the one on the end, that's my office in Washington [D.C.] when I was president and my eldest son is standing behind me, Ronald [Ronald Frazier II].  That's the Ronald son.  Okay.  Oh, I don't know.
Speaker 2: These are some--this is an Orange Bowl [Orange Bowl Committee] event in December.  Russ [Frazier's brother, Cyrus Jollivette, Jr.] nominated me.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is Venice [Italy] about seven, eight years ago.
Speaker 2: Oh gosh what's his name?  He's deceased.  Yes, Harold Washington and I mean who knows I was president and you know I got a ton of these, some kind of Links' event.  I have a ton of pictures like that with different people.
Speaker 1: This is, oh that's my daughter [Rozalynn S. Frazier] who is also a Link so this is one of our, this is at a national assembly.
Speaker 2: This is, I think that's a western area conference.  These are three friends we went to Washington.  We went to New York [New York] together, that's what we did.  We went to New York together and one of them was friendly with the guy who, who bought Madam C.J. Walker's mansion [Villa Lewaro, Irvington, New York] so we spent the night there.
Speaker 1: That is my grandson on his fifth birthday.  He had a big party here.  His--Ronald Eugene Frazier III [Ronald Frazier III].
Speaker 2: Okay these others I can, you know, they are nondescript activities.
Speaker 1: That's my daddy [Cyrus Jollivette, Sr.] holding me when I was a baby.
Speaker 2: This is an Easter Sunday.  Don't ask me which one.
Speaker 1: This is me with my sister [Cleo Jollivette], oh you met her when you came in.
Speaker 2: This is graduation from Booker T. Washington Senior School [Miami, Florida].  I thought it was so cool.  They had me come back and give the graduates an address at my tenth anniversary of graduation okay.
Speaker 1: These are the Brownies.  I was a Brownie and I grew up to be chairman of the council here in Dade [Miami-Dade County, Florida] and Monroe [Monroe County, Florida] counties.
Speaker 2: This is, that's him, can you believe that?  I mean Hopalong Cassidy was a big deal when I was a kid.
Speaker 1: This is, this is, this is me as a baby.
Speaker 2: That's me with my mother.
Speaker 1: That's me, we had bathing suits--she had bathing suits made alike for us to go to American Beach [Florida].  You know American Beach?  Oh it's up by Jacksonville [Florida].  It was like the place for black people to go.  We would get a cabin for a week.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: I don't remember what that is.
Speaker 2: That's my engagement picture, that one yeah.
Speaker 1: This, this is the night I got my AKA pin, you can see the pin on there and this is me trying to take a picture without, without going to a professional photographer and when I looked at that, then I went and had that made.  So, and I guess that's, that's about.
Speaker 2: I don't know where that is you know.  And this is probably a Boule Christmas party or something.  But I was really surprised when he had these boards made for my birthday.
Speaker 1: Oh, I got one with my three children.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's just a Boule party.
Speaker 2: (TAPE INTERUPTION)
Speaker 1: Oh those are my husband and my two sons and that one in the crystal case that's we went to a fiftieth anniversary--oh those are my two children, my eldest is away at college and we took a family portrait.  That would have been let's see, Ron [Ronald Frazier II] was born in '69 [1969], so eighteen years later would be what, that's probably around '97 [1997], '98 [1998].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
