Speaker 1: --Starting by slating it, so I'm [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole.  I'm interviewing you for The HistoryMakers.  Julieanna Richardson, the founder, and Cristina Krumsick [Cristina Suarez Krumsick] are observing.  Matthew Hickey is our videographer; and I'd like for you to say and spell your name--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and your date of birth and today's date, and where we are.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My name is [HistoryMaker] Marcus Samuelsson.  My real name is actually Kassahun Tsegie, so I have two names.  I am fortunate with that.
Speaker 1: Can you spell (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Marcus is spelled M-A-R-C-U-S, S-A-M-U-E-L-S-S-O-N.  My date of birth is very vague.  There's really no traction of my birth, but the official one is November 6, 1970.  The only thing I know is it's not that date.  And today's date is July 18, I want to say, 2014.
Speaker 1: And where are we?
Speaker 2: We're in Harlem [New York, New York], my home, in my restaurant, the Red Rooster [Red Rooster Harlem].
Speaker 1: What's the address?
Speaker 2: 310 Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard].
Speaker 1: Excellent.  What is your occupation?
Speaker 2: My occupation, I'm a chef.  I've been, I've essentially had two jobs in my life: I've been a cook and now I'm a chef.
Story_ID: 664713
Speaker 1: So I'm going to ask you some People magazine type questions--
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to start off, okay?  What--this is a good one.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is a home cooked meal, when I think about what I love to eat every day, is really you know making meatballs with my grandmother, eating the gravy, the mashed potatoes; somewhere fighting with my sister [Linda Samuelsson], kicking her under the (laughter) under the table, kicking her legs under the table; eating pickles with my grandmother.  That's my memory when you say to me, what's my favorite food.  My other sort of scent of food is, you know, open door coming home after working and just smelling doro wat, the chicken stew from Ethiopia, very often home cooked either by my wife [Maya Haile Samuelsson] or one of my relatives; those two dishes conveys home and is my favorite food.
Speaker 1: What's your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Summer is my favorite time of year.  I just love the stickiness; I love, also, the vegetables.  You know, I change my diet completely during the summer.  I go much more vegetables and fruit, and protein has a much smaller part of it--but, like corn, peaches, tomatoes, fava beans, you just, you know; and that's different from when I grew up, because summer meant mackerel, horseradish, potato and herring--all delicious stuff.  This all relates to summer and all the food that we had, you go, have to go outside to catch it.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I want to say my favorite color in so many ways is black; and yet, it is not black, but it has always been the thing that defined me and been in the conversation and I know you work all your life for it not to define you.  I know it's never been black, because when you look at black as black people, we are in all shades, but it's still the one thing in that--it's like honey, it is the one thing that sticks us together and sometimes, you know, sets us apart.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: My favorite vacation--you know, I'm not really a vacation person.  I just remember the summers where I grew up and that meant vacation, so that was when I was a kid.  You know, the day after school finished, my mom, my parents [Samuelsson's adoptive parents, Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson], we, they drove us up--and it just meant working with different things.  During the winter years we worked in school--of course we had a lot of homework and schoolwork.  In summertime our work was, we worked around the boats, got to help out, so it was just different labor.  But it was always fun and, you know, the only difference was that you could get done earlier at the summer house.  You started earlier, started at five, maybe six, but you could get done at two with everything.  I mean, that meant that you went--took the boat out, went fishing with your uncles, got the fish, cleaned the boat, cleaned the fish, cooked the fish, preserved the fish, the mackerel, gave some fish to the elder, maybe got some fish to sell, make your own money, to the vacationers; and then ate, and by the time it was two o'clock, you were done with everything and then you could play soccer all day, which was great.  And then you were tired; at seven o'clock I was beat, every day (laughter).  So, that's vacation to me; and I, you know, that's really, I don't--really vacation--I mean, my wife wants to vacation and that's the problem like, sometimes we don't vacation.  But when I vacation, I vacation around food, and it's hard.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: You know, I think about a phrase a lot, which is: fine folks--which is something that, you know, my grandmother, she was a maid, you know, a very simple, live in, very lo- for a long time of her life, and, you know, when you think about Sweden, you don't think about poor people, and white poor people, but she was of poverty, so although we grew up in middle class and even upper middle class, but the journey is of poverty and listening to her needing her food is of--of poverty; and she, her phrase was always when you, if we went places you know you should never look fine folks in the eye, you should look down.  And that, for me, is very telling of poverty, but it's also, you know, it's just--that could have been any lady from the South saying the same thing coming to the city.
Story_ID: 664714
Speaker 1: Perfect segue, I'd like to talk about your family--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and starting with your birth mother--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --could you tell us about her?
Speaker 2: Well you know, I never, I have no memories of, of meeting or seeing my mother, so, the memory I have is very, is really strong based on imagination.  You know I've been on the savanna of Ethiopia many, many times and each time when we'd drive from the city to the village where I'm from, you see--look out the window and you see all these women very young, very strong, walking.  They carry a lot of water and food, and maybe one or two children and I would think about, that's my mother.  She had to do that walk with us, with me and my sister [Linda Samuelsson], and she did it many, many times in her short life.  What I know is that she passed away when she was around twenty-eight years old in tuberculosa, which is something that both me and my sister had; and, you know she truly gave us everything, and that's one of the reasons why she passed away.  She walked us from our village, she found a hospital and she passed away, so I always feel like I carry that message of someone who gave it her all, her best.  So I've--you know, I've also been very fortunate to grow up with my second family, but my birth mother, I don't have any memories of.
Speaker 1: What's her name; and what was the name of your village?
Speaker 2: So, Ahnu is the name of my mother; and the village is Abragodana [Ethiopia], which is the, when you think about Africa, the traditional village of basically mud houses--that, in itself, it's very high architecture.  The- you have to build them in a specific way and it is a collective that everyone helps out.  There's about twenty-five huts with, I would say, six to eight family members in each one; so there is around 175 to 200 people, where they have very strict order.  If you come from the West, you might just try to pass it and don't think much of it, but it has spirituality, it has community, the strongest sense of community.  It is tribal; and it has a purpose.
Speaker 1: What is the tribe, is?
Speaker 2: So, our tribe is Amhara tribe, which is also the same tribe that Haile Selassie stems from, so you can be very regal of the tribe even though it's not connected to money.
Speaker 1: And, can you spell your mother's name?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  A-H-N-U: Ahnu.
Story_ID: 664715
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about her predecessors, her mom, or?
Speaker 2: We- you know the one thing I've learned is, you know, being adopted and going back, it taught me a lot of different things about myself; and also very much how westerners in general and how Africans in general, how different we view the world.  You know, in the West we very often want to know, what's the truth; and was that correct?  With, you know, I'm not sure if you ever can get to the truth because there are always two different ways of looking at it, or many different ways of looking at it.  And when I ask my father [Samuelsson's biological father, Tsegie] that is still alive, he always asks us, ask- answers the same: "You got educated, you were raised in a family that taught you many things; and you're doing fine."  What else is there--for him, it's what else is there?
Speaker 1: Which father?
Speaker 2: My Ethiopian father, because, you know, I've asked him about our adoption and how did we get adopted, what happened, you know 'cause there's a lot of missing pieces that, you know, if you look at it from a Swedish point of view and an American point of view of like, you want the answers, you want these answered, almost like, you know it's not court.  I can't hold my father up as a court.  I'm not a judge.  Although I want it--I'm very curious, I want to know answers.  I just know that I will never get the answers the way maybe you and I are talking today.  They're much more in, just in different hemisphere.  Maybe he doesn't want to talk about it.  I understand, also, once you're there you understand how--what are the chances that two kids [Samuelsson and his sister, Linda Samuelsson] would survive and two kids would get to Sweden.  It's so random.  It's so based on spirituality.  It's also luck.  It's also, I'm here based on the goodness of so many other people, so many (unclear)--you have no idea. I'm going to tell you a couple of scenarios of events, right.  My Swedish parents [Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson] got married.  They wanted to have a family.  Now, if this would have been this time, you know, maybe they could have had it the natural way because development of so many different things is much (unclear).  That's one scenario.  My parents had already accepted a boy from Bolivia, but his grandmother demanded in the last minute that my parents had to go to Bolivia once a year.  Now, this is the '70s [1970s].  They couldn't afford to fly to South America once a year.  If she wouldn't have said that, they would have adopted a kid from Bolivia.  All right?  When we got to the hospital, we were cured pretty quickly from TB [tuberculosis].  What are you going to do?  There are thousands of kids.  There is a line around, you know, around the corner just to get into the hospital, so just imagine what my mom [Samuelsson's biological mother, Ahnu] had to do to get in to the hospital.  Once we were there and we got cured, where are we going?  No address.  So, just the goodness of that nurse, the nurse that had three kids of her own said, "I'm gonna take these kids in."  Now, so there are so many things, there's been so many stories that don't make it a normal transition, whatever that is so I've just learned to accept that; and, but it's also based on that determination that I walk to work every day, that I carry myself every day, and that I know it makes me the one who I am, you know.  It doesn't make me better, it just make me very clear on my purpose that there are so many events that has happened, so now I have to do the most of that opportunity.
Story_ID: 664716
Speaker 1: Tell me about your Ethiopian father; his name, and?
Speaker 2: So my father, his name is Tsegie, and he is a, both an orthodox priest and a tribe leader in, in Abragodana [Ethiopia], where he, in part of moving his community couple of times through battles and wars, and has a family of eight more kids besides me and my sister [Linda Samuelsson]; has a new wife that--they have been married for, you know, twenty-five, twenty-seven years; and I met him the first time ten years ago.
Speaker 1: When he was with your mom [Samuelsson's biological mother, Ahnu], do you know anything about their relationship?
Speaker 2: I know very little.  We, you know, it's not for lack of trying and asking, it's just all things that, you know, I think it could be a blend, it was so long a time ago.  There was definitely no documentation; and it was also, I'm sure brutally difficult to lose your wife, your two kids, and to start again; so it was many reasons.
Story_ID: 664717
Speaker 1: Let's go to--you're at the hospital and the nurse rescued you and your sister.  How did you come to get adopted; and who, who are your adoptive parents [Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson] and your sister's name.
Speaker 2: So, my older sister, her name is Linda [Linda Samuelsson], and Fantaye is her Ethiopian name; and she's really been my caretaker in many ways, you know, because I, (unclear) we were adopted a little bit older than normal- normally, although adoption can happen at any age, but my sister was six, five to six, and I was two to three; and so when we got adopted to Sweden, there was definitely a little tension between my mother and my sister because my sister has been my sole caretaker for all those years and, you know, I think that that tension was based on protection from both sides and eventually, you know, obviously they got, got, everybody got on the same page.  You know, my sister has had responsibility of me from a very, very early age--you know, from the age of three or four and five, and when you realize, when you go to Africa, you realize that that's not rare.  I know, when I met my, my sister--when I went to Ethiopia one of the first times and I met my sisters, they were just four, five, and six, they got strong arms, they knew how to carry water, they knew how to walk for two hours to get--they knew how to survive, they knew how to cook--at five years old they know how to cook.  So you realize that that tradition is not that strange--it's actually the majority.  It is no different than to think about how it was in America, especially for people of color.  You know, think about, I think about the cooks that cooked for, you know, [President] Thomas Jefferson.  Your know, Honore [Honore Julien] and--they were fifteen to eighteen years old and they were executive chefs at fifteen, so that means that they started to work at five.
Story_ID: 664718
Speaker 1: Your adoptive parents, can you tell me their names and who they are and about them?
Speaker 2: Ann Marie [Ann Marie Samuelsson] is my mother and Lennart [Lennart Samuelsson] is my father, my father passed away about fifteen years ago, Lennart.  But Ann Marie and Lennart, they gave me, they've been, they were, I always say they were behind me, next to me, in front of me, depending on what, what is still needed and what was needed.  And they gave, they gave me and my sisters a home in every sense of the word, and protection and love and caring and everything that parenting involves.
Speaker 1: So was it unusual for Swedish parents to adopt black, African children?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was very, you know adoption in the '70s [1970s] was very rare, especially adoption through, you know, different continents.  So we definitely are family--you know, we got a very strong sense of family because we were different.  Our parents are white; my other sister's [Anna Samuelsson] mixed--half black, half white; Linda [Linda Samuelsson] and I came from Ethiopia; and then, eventually, we had cousin from Korea and Canada and, you know, we had a Jew- had a Jewish aunt and all those different things.  So, we grew up in a family, an extended family that was very vibrant and different, but we were also, our direct immediate family and 99 percent of everything, we were the same as any family.  We went to a good school, we had to work hard; our parents led us.  The only difference was our color of skins and that says, that 1 percent in many ways was everything, right?  But the other 99, we had to do--we got reprimanded, we got loved, we got hugged just like any other neighbor kid.
Speaker 1: In terms of your identity, I mean you're grow- were they blonde haired, blue eyed people, as many people from Scandinavia are?
Speaker 2: I mean, they were definitely--they weren't blonde and blue eyed, but they were definitely, you know, traditional Nordic Swedes, you know, very handsome, both of them very tall, mother is a very pretty lady and my father is very strong.  You know, when you think about a Nordic person, yeah, he can be--he grew up in a fishing village where he has these natural muscles.  You know, you have to learn how to row early and grew up in a boat; so simplistic on the outset, but like all people, extremely complex.  With my father--we're very different.  My father was very much a visionary, although he grew up on a boat and they were pretty poor, they owned their own boat.  His mom had their own bed and breakfast; so they didn't have a lot of money but they always had food, and they owned--whatever they had, they owned it.  They owned a house.  They owned their boat.  So, there was hope always; and eventually, he had a big decision.  He was the first one.  He was the oldest in the family.  He was the first one to leave and go to a university, which was a big decision because it meant that they would no longer be fishermen; and eventually he ma- became a geologist and eventually he ran his own business.  But it was a very controversial decision because who was--he was, that was their breadwinning thing, this was their business and for not, for the oldest son to take over the business, what's gonna happen; and eventually--so there were no longer fishermen, 'cause all the other kids went to college and university as well.  They all did very, very well, but it did shut down that business that their family had had for generation, so there was definitely success there but it was also game changing in terms of our heritage; and I know that was very hard for my father because he felt very torn about his success.  But he also knew that at the same time they--him and the other kids they definitely didn't take the tradition.  If you ask him what he was, even if he had--he traveled all over the world, spoke many languages, build bridges, farmed minerals, all over the world, he was still a fisherman's son.  My mother, on the other hand, she grew up in the south [South Sweden] during poverty.  You know, if you ask my mom, when my mom--what defined my mother was the Second World War [World War II, WWII].  It's the, how they truly looked and viewed the world--Germany, Nazis, Sweden's role, the relationship to, they were a poor town so a lot of Jews walked when you know between Denmark and where my mom is from, it's very close.  You can walk, when it's winter you can walk on the ice over, and they took kids in, which was very controversial, especially in a household where her father was not working, he was unemployed; and her mother was a maid.  So that economy and where they lived was very, very, was bare bones but it was the right thing to do.  So, if you ask my mother, she is of poverty, although you know if you would see where we grew up and where we traveled and, you know, we had two cars, two homes, traveled all over the world--that does not, from the outskirt maybe looking into our window you wouldn't see that, but if you ask her who she is, she is a blue collar lady that, you know you work with your hands, and you don't trust anybody--nobody.  Nobody.
Story_ID: 664719
Speaker 1: I want you to go back to your childhood; and tell me, what is your earliest memory of your childhood?
Speaker 2: I have many early memories.  One is the fact that me and my sister [Linda Samuelsson], we're banging on the refrigerator because we saw that food came out of the refrigerator; and we were, we'd never seen this machine before--that you open a door and there was food.  And I think that's very telling of where we came from, where we had landed, and where I am today.
Story_ID: 664720
Speaker 1: Can you describe the house you grew up in, the neighborhood you grew up in (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  So, I grew up about twenty minutes outside Gothenburg, which is the second largest city in Sweden.  It's a blue collar town where Volvo cars are being made, Hasselblad cameras; a lot of, you know, there was definitely labor, you know.  I call it Pittsburgh by the sea (laughter).  But it's also historical, very important because it was a port town, so there's always a connection to the world--trading, whether it was spices to Southeast Asia, or it was going to America, Gothenburg was the port.  We grew up in a suburban, very simple home, not that big.  I remember our first home were, was two floors, not that big, one bathroom, but a huge garden, so we were outside a lot, no matter what weather.  You know, Sweden can be cold winter--we were outside.  I don't actually remember my childhood indoor a lot besides being in the kitchen.  Those are on- basically my only memories from that age of being three to six or seven.  When I was seven, something happened with our family.  We moved to a bigger house, much bigger house, new community only five minutes away, but it was new; and you know, as a seven year old kid you notice these things so differently.  I no longer had to share my room.  I thought it was horrible.  Why would I, why would my sister [Linda Samuelsson] have a different room?  You know, so I was always in her room anyway (laughter) but I didn't like that.  I didn't like to have my own room.  I never really got used to that, actually, 'cause we were always together and I never really understood the purpose that all the kids, we had now our own room.  We had, a car was now in the garage which it wasn't before; and the house was now three floors, and there were bathrooms on every floor.  Our bath was not, you know, you weren't cramped in it.  It was like big showers; and so something happened.  You know, as I got older I realized that my father [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] had gotten a big promotion and eventually could run his own business, but it also meant that he wasn't home at six o'clock every day eating dinner.  He traveled.  He could sometimes come back from Saudi Arabia, from the United States, from all over the world.  We had sometimes international visitors in our home.  So this is all from a seven year, eight year old perspective.  I started school and all the kids I went to school with in my class, they lived within two hundred yards away, so we were all thirty of us, or twenty-eight of us, we were all from the same neighborhood; and it's so different than today; you know, I've never had a play date, and it was all spontaneous playing.  You know, you're done with school, your homework, you ate; and then you ran outside and everything happened there.  You know, like you, you know your bike got stolen on the street.  You stole another bike back or whatever.  You know, whatever happened, like whatever lesson, the older kids, you know, you played soccer with the older kids or hockey in the winter, or whatever it was, it was, everything happened.
Story_ID: 664721
Speaker 1: Marcus [HistoryMaker Marcus Samuelsson], you were talking about that--that one drop--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) the--the--
Speaker 2: (Gesture) One drop, right.
Speaker 1: --yeah.  Can you describe what your experience has been of that color, what color means.
Speaker 2: Well, the experience is no different than what any black person in America or anywhere in the world in our diaspora dealt with, so I don't want to make my experience--I have no right to make my experience bigger than, but you're asking me so I can talk about it from my experience.  It is the defining moment and it defines so many different things.  Even if we work all of our life not to be defined like that, I am not trying to walk away from myself, you know.  I'm in my skin so I'm not walking away from my journey; but, it also not define you as in how you measure standards, goals, spirituality, or right from wrong.  So, it's tricky.  You know, like, as a child you look at your skin and you do every- you want everything as your neigh- as your best friend: you want to do well in school, you want to work hard, you wanna, you know, you wanna fight with your sister--whatever it is, right?  Like, it's the same as everybody; but yet, you know somebody ruined your day because they called you nigger in school; and I don't know one word that hits me more, like, you know, lemon in your eye, than nigger.  It's like the strongest, strongest, still to this day, it's just still the strongest word and I don't know as an adult, still like, (gasps) I have no response.  It just chokes me.  The word just chokes me, and I, I mean, it's something I've dealt all my life.  Here, I remember when, when on Alex Haley's--when you know when they started showing 'Roots' in Sweden.  And I--they used to show it on Tuesdays and I hated to go to school on Wednesday because it was all (unclear) in my school, so these are things that I remember very, very well.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: I was probably, first time they showed it, I was probably like eight or nine; and then, you know I mean they showed it many times in Sweden, and it's a very good piece and important journey, but you also learn how to, I think it's also like blackness is where I got my strength from.  Africa is where I got my step from.  So, it's been, it is why I have learned, always learned a strong purpose, who I am; and it also given me, it is who I am, you know.  I know why I can do things differently, both positive and negatives.
Story_ID: 664722
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about the adoption process?  Do, do you know what, how your parents came to get you and your sister [Linda Samuelsson]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean they tried to have their own children for a very long time and then they decided to adopt; and the dop- adoption process was something that was nothing that--my mom [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson] didn't enjoy the process because she felt like she had to define--first, she went through all this time of--(sighs) it's even difficult to talk about.  You know, she's just like a regular young woman trying to have a family and then not being able to carry her own children, so she felt horrible through that; and, you know, there's a lot of people all over the world that that happens to.  And then, this random woman had to come in and ask and check if she was capable to be a mother.  You know this is a very deep issue question for a young woman just trying to go on with her life and trying to have a family; and then you have to have, you know, someone come in and see if you cleaned your house and if you--you know, it's just like very insensitive, difficult questioning.  You know, my father [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] was much more, he's much more--my father was very pragmatic and this is the process we've got to go through.  Don't, you know, raise your voice and we're gonna win.  We're gonna go through, and he was right but it's such a tough thing because my mom gets very emotional.  Now, I understand her, like how would you feel if someone comes in and say, "Do you clean your house," just because she can't have a child.  Those three things have nothing--I don't see the link.  But it is also done in an era and a time where, you know, sensitivity to this must have been at the highest, you know.  But we got through it, they got through it and they stuck together and they did it.
Speaker 1: So the agency that they used is, was an international agency?
Speaker 2: I assume so.  I don't know if it was international.  I know that they used an agency that maybe then worked with international, so, I don't know exactly all the detail of how they were registered.
Story_ID: 664723
Speaker 1: So I'd like to go back to your neighborhood when you were growing up.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the sights, sounds and smells that you remember?
Speaker 2: Great.  Our neighborhood was in the woods, and this is in the late '70s [1970s] when they just, they just cut down the woods and put in two hundred homes, basically; and, but, so our surrounding was the woods, so our playgrounds was the woods.  You know, in Sweden, all land is public land.  There is no private land.  So, you can run around as a child and everything you find in the woods you can eat.  It's yours.  You cannot eat everything, but it's yours: blueberries, lingonberries, mushrooms, whatever it is.  So, you are in the woods and you're picking blueberries and you're mashing your buddy with blueberries in your face and, you know, it's very, it's--you're alive (laughter) you know what I mean?  You're having fun, and, so the sound, the woods is the sound.  Once you're in the woods, you know, nature is king, which means that it can be very wet, you have to watch where you walk.  You could fall down.  There are other animals.  So, nature is king.  You learn about nature very early, that you can't just throw garbage in the woods.  You have to be very respectful in nature.  Something that they taught.  And it was easier for us because we came from the water with my parents [Samuelsson's adoptive parents, Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson], so we were water kids.  It's the same when you own the ocean.  You can't just throw garbage in the ocean; you know, the ocean is king too.  It is nature (gesture).  And, it's very similar to how my African family--nature is king, you're not.
Speaker 1: What did the woods smell like?
Speaker 2: It, it de- it changes throughout the years.  You know, fall is very wet and almost has this sour fragrance--very wet.  You just remember yourself as a child, just being wet constantly, because you're still outside and it's tougher, but it's cold and you're wet.  Wintertime, I loved it because it's crispy.  You can ice skate everywhere; and you know, as a child, you always wanna test how far could you go, and sometimes you fell in the water, and, but you're just gonna go further and further and further.  We played hockey a lot and we ice skated a lot.  But you were always cold.  But, it was this blend between being sweaty and cold at the same time (background noise)--it was this blend of being sweaty and cold at the same time because you are so active, but then you were also cold.  Spring was chilly but crisp.  It was not as heavy as fall, but it was also wet; and summertime, you could be out all day, all night.  It was bright.  You know, 'cause in, you know in June and July, Sweden, sun doesn't go down; you know, you could be out all day--it's like Alaska.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: I went to, you know we are public school kids.  In Sweden, all schools are public, and we went to a very good school.  We believed it to be a very good school, and we felt it was a very good school.  It was our school, and.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Oaks Lid [ph.], which was just, it's a twenty minute walk, a seven minute bike ride.  Our home, it was a forty minute to an hour walk because you were always, you know, we had to always look out for the elder kids, like maybe they were two or three grades--they were a couple of years older than you and there was some stuff going on. That walk--that we got home every day is still like mystery to me; but it was fun, so.
Speaker 1: What happened, what happened on the walk?
Speaker 2: You know, all the kids walking home from school and they try to steal your bike and you're messing with, you know, the other kids from other, other, another class, and, but it was very communal and fun; and it was definitely, it is was also--you walk through nature so you run down to the water.  Summertime, you jump into the water, you push each other in the water, like, but you know, it's all in good fun; and nothing major happened.  But, you know, just teasing each other and we were having fun.  That, that you know, it is a fifteen minute to twenty minute walk and it could be an hour and a half on a May day or something like that.  But you were having fun.
Speaker 1: Did you get to school on time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you have to get to school on time.  No, no, no, you have to.  There's no--you have to; they shut the door.  You can't come in late.  I mean like, you missed it.  (Makes sound) Shut--that's it.
Speaker 1: What kind of a student was young Marcus [HistoryMaker Marcus Samuelsson]?
Speaker 2: I was very, very energetic.  I enjoyed school a lot.  I enjoyed--there was a lot of camaraderie.  But it was also very difficult in many ways; you know, being the on- me and my sister [Linda Samuelssson], we were the only black kids and the only--of any color.  I remember in third grade there was a Finnish boy starting.  He was blonder than--Finnish, I mean, it's just, it's like Arkansas, Louisiana.  You know what I mean?  It's right there.  Connecticut, Massachusetts--right there.  In fourth grade there was an Indian boy coming to the neighborhood; and eventually in fifth grade there was someone that was half Brazilian.  That's it, and then there was me and my sister; you know, five hundred kids.
Speaker 1: How were you treated?
Speaker 2: It depends, you know.  When it was school dance, like roy- royalty.  When it was, sometimes when we just had breaks, it could be very tough.  There were a lot of fights.  When it was sports, we always, I always managed the best.  I was very athletic, so it was easy to be, you know, I set the pa- you know picking the teams--all that stuff.  So it was highs and lows, you know.  It was--
Speaker 1: How were you royalty at the dance?
Speaker 2: Because I'm the only one that had rhythm, you know.  All the Swedish kids, they can't, you know, they tried but you know, they're Swedes, you know.
Story_ID: 664725
Speaker 1: How would you describe young Marcus [HistoryMaker Marcus Samuelsson] as a person?
Speaker 2: We were very confident.  We got our confidence from our mother [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson]; you know, she, my mother was, at the bottom she was a very vain woman, very vain.  Her vanity, in the best way, our house has to be clean, very nice; you have to make your own bed.  You leave, your room has to be nice.  The kit- so, you leave your house you have to look proper, dapper.  And you know my mom, she, going shopping was like an event for us, just going to the local store because everybody came up to touch our hair, to touch our skin.  So, you know it was very annoying for my mother.  She just wanted to get milk or she just wanted to get fish, and it became an event; so she was very aware of her appearance and our appearance.  She has to make up my sister's hair every day.  She used to have Essence in one hand--you know this was a white woman, you know, she had no clue how to do black hair.  She used to have maybe a two year old Essence that she got from a friend that went to London [England] and, you know, literally see them like this and (gesture) making my sister's hair like; and, you know, I'm listening to them screaming because she burnt them or (laughter) whatever she did wrong, and she had no clue how to do this; but, you know, eventually my older sister [Anna Samuelsson] managed how to do it herself and then she taught my sister [Linda Samuelsson] and eventually--and, you know, we had to look proper.  It was definitely you do not leave your house without looking a certain way because it was like an event.  You know, I can, it is its own, it taught me, it prepared me for the life I'm living today.  You know, I probably take--not one day goes by without me taking at least 100 pictures, right?  And, I don't see a big difference than when I was a kid.
Speaker 1: You mean of people taking pictures of you when you go outside?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, every day, and wherever I am in the world, so I've gotten used to that, right.  And that might not be a lot compared to other, but it takes time.  You know, you have to be prepared--every day and it's annoying sometimes, but it's also the work that we do.  Right?  So it's annoying sometimes for other people that I'm with but, that, I'm like it's no different.  It's been very similar for a long time.
Speaker 1: What was it like for your mom when she adopted you?
Speaker 2: Annoying, very difficult for my mother.
Speaker 1: The race aspect?
Speaker 2: Very difficult.  She wanted to just raise a family and have normal kids and, you know, it was very difficult--not for my father [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] because he worked and my mom was mostly with us, you know; but the, he didn't see the daily looks and touches; and most day- and I couldn't say that those families of kids were racists, they were just curious.  Very much like you walk into--you know kids just want to, they just want to (gesture) notice and touch and see; and it was not based on racism.  It was just based on they just didn't know, and there were days where my mom--they didn't think it was a big deal and there were days when she was very short; and I think it had to do with whatever she had to get done, right?  If she had to go to the poist off- post office, get one of us to the dentist, you know, whatever--I mean her list of daily things but it definitely affected her mood.

Speaker 1: When you were a little boy, what did you dream of doing with your life when you would become an adult?
Speaker 2: I always thought I would become a soccer star.  It was actually very surprising to me the day when I didn't; and up until that day, I just thought I would be a soccer player.  I know that sounds very naive, but I just, I viewed myself--I played on a very good team, I captained the team, I, we travelled with the team; I always thought--
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: A lot of things happened, I mean many ways, that was not the path I cho- you know--I know that if I were talk to you today, I would have been an ex-soccer player and maybe not knowing what to do with my life at this point.  Now, I view myself as a failed soccer player but a very good cook, and I can work for the rest of my life.  So, in many ways it was the right door for me not to go that, but it was very painful, it was very painful for me.
Speaker 1: Well, I read about--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --your soccer career in 'Yes, Chef' ['Yes, Chef: A Memoir,' Marcus Samuelsson with Veronica Chambers], and could you describe what happened at that point when your career ended?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I mean soccer is, there is--no different than life.  It very much came back to the core of my race and the capability of me as an individual and how, where sports were in Sweden at that time.  You know, most foreign players, like we, I played on a team with a lot of foreigners--we can do things with a ball and play in a way that Swedish people cannot play, but, it was also not the way that you played in Sweden.  You know, we play more in a rhythmic way and we are, we admire the Brazilians.  The Swedes were more like, they are much stronger, very strong kids, could run very, very long and hard, but you know they don't, they are great athletes but they were not soccer players; and now we live in Sweden where the national team is very mixed but, you know, twenty years ago it wasn't.  So, you know, the way we played was good but it wasn't necessarily appreciated; and there were no coaches to even know, 'cause the coaches were born in the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s].  (Laughter) They have no way to even understand to coach our kids.  We were rad and, you know, we won a lot.  But, it's okay, I mean, soccer taught me so much.  It taught me teamwork, work ethic in a different way than my parents [Samuelsson's adoptive parents, Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson] taught me work ethic.  It taught me to listen to coach, show up on time, talent can only get you so far.  It taught me about rejection, which is a big part of an adult's life, any adult's life.  It is not necessarily ra- linked always to race--it could be, but it's, rejection happens in all people's life; and it's very, it's very hard to deal with, but soccer teaches you that.  It teaches me about how to lose with grace.  It's very hard, but also joy of collecting, of doing something together.  I mean it's like, like life.  It's very humbling.  There are moments of joy, but it is (laughter) there is a lot of pain too.  But it's good.

Speaker 1: Where did your love of, of food come from?
Speaker 2: From my grandmother, from my grandmother.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: My grandmother Helga is really the one that showed me what love meant in terms of food and terroir--that you're of a place.  You know, I got that essentially from my uncles in, on my father's side, but also mostly from my grand- from my grandmother.  We are of a place and therefore we eat this way.  It is a spiritual connection, so she taught me how to eat with a spiritual compass--not necessarily defined by a religion but more so, you know, when you don't have money you can still eat very well.  You just don't eat the cuts that fine folks eat; so our protein was meatballs, or our dishes had more potatoes in them, or, you know, our bread crumbs were made with real bread and you have to scrape it and save it and dry it.  All our--so the sense and way of eating with a luxury, that's how we eat but we are not spending a lot of money on it.  All our jams were homemade.  All our tarts, all our breads were homemade; so I grew up very rustic flavor tone--saltier, crustier bread, textures that were hard, but real food so at a very early age I can define--.  She taught me, she gave me blueberries when they were not in season just to teach me, "Okay.  See this?  They are not in season.  Don't eat them.  You have to wait."  She taught me when the lingonberries were ripe to pick.  My uncles taught me how to fish and when to throw the fish back when it was just, maybe, two inches too short.  There are different rules on the sea that you have to know, that you know any person on the sea who knows these things, what you don't do, what you do, how you treat it.  But the fish we ate summertime was always fresh; again, very salty flavors and you preserved fish for the days when you don't know what is going to happen, when you don't have food, whereas my family back then, oh, we always talk--the Russian might come.  We were constantly occupied with the fact that Russia would come and take over Sweden.  You had to hide food in the basement, just like my parents--my father in Ethiopia [Tsegie] hides food today because another tribe might come and take it from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Today?
Speaker 2: Of course, today--there is no difference.
Story_ID: 664728
Speaker 1: Can you tell me more about your education in Sweden?
Speaker 2: You know, being a small country, you were taught English very early, you were taught that you had to speak languages.  We were taught German and English early; and we were also taught a lot about America--but not only America but Russia and Japan and England as well, a little bit about Africa, a little bit, very short.  But you were, we were taught about the world, and it is almost as if they prepared us for the 21st century in a way; so I can do this interview in German, I can do this interview in Swedish, of course, I do it English.
Speaker 1: What about Amharic?
Speaker 2: Not Amharic.
Speaker 1: Do you know that at all?
Speaker 2: No, not enough to speak, no.  So, they taught you.  They prepared you for life in many ways, but not prepared you in multi culture, because that was so foreign.  Diversity was so foreign.  You're dealing with 95 percent, 95 percent Protestant homogenous community.
Story_ID: 664729
Speaker 1: When did you decide that you wanted to become a chef, take food seriously?
Speaker 2: The day when I beca- didn't make it as a soccer player.
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: Sixteen [years old].  Just the same determination, hard work.  It was very hard.  It was the only time I didn't know my identity very well; you know, like it was very, it was the only time in my life, it was like a six month period, it was very, what's gonna happen.  You know, I'm not--you know soccer was my identity.  It's how I went through school, how I had my girlfriend, how I--my swagger.  Like everything, how I could speak to the headmaster if I needed a day off; all my swag, everything was around soccer.  We won the school championship for our city; you know, like we were privileged in a way, and I have never done that through, not through sports.  I just didn't know.  So, what's gonna happen now?  Like, it was very hard.  I remember I had to quickly--and then I knew that all the hours I spent on soccer, that was time, right?  And my parents [Samuelsson's adoptive parents, Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson] were a little bit worried because what's gonna happen with that time?  Am I going to--you know, you know, growing up you know a lot of kids that do bad stuff, so I didn't want to focus on that 'cause it's not like, even if you grow up in suburbia, it doesn't mean that that stuff is not around.  Soccer was also, you know, like, your parents don't have to worry because you're not interested in alcohol.  You're not interested in any of that stuff because you- it's competitive.  You have to be prepared.  So, I took that energy and time and effort to push it in through food and work as hard, and I did.
Speaker 1: And was this still in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 664730
Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: In a different school, just a couple of blocks away from where I grew up.  It was the same thing, twenty minutes' ride--walk, twenty minutes' walk--Valhamra [ph.].  But; you know, I knew quickly that I needed to go to school in the city and I did that after a while because, you know, where I come from I come from a very small place, and in Sweden, the City of Gothenburg at least had foreign kids--forget black kids, just foreign kids and I shared a lot.  In Sweden, you know we called each other blatte, which is a word that is defined in--essentially if you want to break blatte down, it encompasses all foreigners because it comes from either the German, schwarzkopf; or the England--English, black head.  So, it's a very derogatory term, name, but it is also unifying; so, you know, we all called each other blatte, and it didn't matter if your parents were Italian, Jewish, Chinese, everyone else but the Swedes, and because all those parents they were working, they're not immigrants.  They were refugees or guest workers and then they stayed, they come from Turkey and Yugoslavia, Italy, Spain, and this is again defined by the Second World War [World War II, WWII], because since Sweden wasn't in the Second World War, Sweden had basically twenty-five year head start on every European country, so we produced for the rest of Europe.  That meant that we needed workers and those workers came from a place, right, factory workers, they came from Spain, Italy, from Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece; and then their parents stayed and their kids were Swedes but they had black hair.  You know that, so all the Africans, all the guest workers, all the refugees were all defined by blatte- as being blatte.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that word?
Speaker 2: B-L- B-L-A-T-T-E.  It was very, I mean you could say to any Swede that, you know, it's like (makes sound)--they don't want to say it, of course, but we all--now, it's a million of us in Sweden.
Speaker 1: Is it like the N word here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's definitely the same meaning.
Speaker 1: But, do you respond to it in the same way?
Speaker 2: You know, I mean, commuters all over the world have always quickly figured out that one door is more important than the other door.  That's not a race.  That's just, we figured that out when we were on the fields, right?  That's going on in Africa today.  England built a whole system on it, right?  In India you have class system.  So that is, that's gonna happen.  Think about the word celebrity right?  So this is not an era, period.  This is ongoing.  These labels just kind of take different connotation (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But when you mentioned the N word earlier--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you had a visceral reaction to it that seems different.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh it's much, you know, because it gets--it, it has different connotation, different history, different journey; and these doors have higher locks on them and they have, you know, deeper history and higher stakes.  The Swedish stakes, I can deal with them, I grew up with that, so it's, it's, you know I can, I can deal with it pretty--.  And, I learned also how to penetrate it and become an ambassador and change it, right?
Story_ID: 664731
Speaker 1: You know, the one thing, you know, bitter is great in food.  You know you eat kale, you eat broccoli; you know, certain fish skin.  Bitter is amazing in food, but it's not gonna get you anywhere in life.  So I love bitter in terms of food, but you gotta get off bitter when you get to life, and I--'cause it doesn't, you know that energy doesn't take you anywhere.  So I knew that energy in Sweden and what to do with that, and I know that energy here in America and what to do with that; and I've been able to transform that through my food.  I employ through that way of diversity and I, everything I do, I think about it through that way because I've been the kid that's been on the outside and not being let in; so I just, there are a lot of things I look through that way.  But, it's, it's, it's never made me bitter.  It's just, okay, let's jump around it.  Let's get--and also, in that time you also practice more and it gets you better.  You know, I like practicing that hard because soccer taught me that.  Cooking teaches me that.  Hard labor--I like it.  It's like, good.  And, I don't remember always when, you know, growing up in Sweden when, you know, just like my neighbor kids thought something was tough; and I was like, this is not tough.  Rowing out on a cold day to get fish, that's tough, and it's like Wednesday you gotta do it and, you know, your engine on the boat may be broke down or, you know, it's gonna take you an hour and a half to row back and you, there's no choice, you gotta do it--that's tough.  Like cleaning a boat in April when it's cold--that's tough.  You know what I mean?  So, I'm like, tough? This isn't tough.  So, I just had all of that stuff, those experiences, were just like, you know--you know cooking, getting fried fish thrown in your face, getting, every scar I have is from plates and food that people have mashed in my face--that's tough.  This is--I just, bitter is not--I'm not gonna get stuck on bitter, not gonna happen.

Speaker 1: Looking at your growing up years in, in Sweden, what was, what was the temperature of the times?  What was life like in Sweden in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: In the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 1: Oh, '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: --eighties [1980s], you know Sweden was definitely going through, rapidly turning, the world was definitely changing.  You have Russia over here, that, are they gonna come and take over?  Is there gonna be war between America and Russia, where does Sweden fit in that?  There was a lot of fear.  There is a Cold War; and my father [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] was--that was really our CNN because he was all over the--you know, he traveled, so he knew the world.  We were thinking do we have to move to the states?  Do we have to--what's gonna happen?  We wasn't--we were almost at the same time, you could tell that we were financially doing much better and you know when you're an adopted kid, it also separates you from an immigrant kid because there was no immigrants living where we were.  So, I spoke perfect Swedish, different than my soccer buddies.  You know, we had a little bit more leisure time than them.  You know it was different, but it was, you know, we, I was ten, twelve years old, listening to Michael Jackson.  You know, the fact that it was a black person on MTV [Music Television; MTV], this was like a big deal.  There was never a black person on MTV.  MTV was a very important thing, you know.  Prince and Michael Jackson were like my heroes because that's how we learned how to dance, that's how we learned how to--what clothing we should wear.  You know, it was the coolest thing ever.  And then Swedish music, I didn't listen to that because it have no rhythm, no beat--well it had rhythm, but not a rhythm that I could understand.  You know, my mom [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson] and I would listen to a lot of music, Marvin [Marvin Gaye], Bob Marley, Commodores [The Commodores], Lionel [Lionel Richie], Michael, Stevie [Stevie Wonder].  We went, you know, to concerts.  My mom talked a lot about music, a lot about music.  It was very important for her.  You know, we were, we were definitely the odd family, but it was so confusing because we spoke Swedish very well.  So we were not like them--whatever them were, right.  We were different and that was--we were different than the immigrants in their camp.  We were different than the Swedes.  So we were just, I just, we just relied on ourselves a lot.  We had a lot of friends, but those friends knew us deeply, deep tissue.  They knew that there wasn't a crazy lady inside our house.  There was a regular mom that just tried to feed her kids, there was a regular father that went to work and just tried to support his family.
Story_ID: 664733
Speaker 1: Given that you described how your mom [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson] experienced challenge and difficulty having brown children, did, did she ever express any sense of regret or worry about having adopted African children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, my mom never sensed regret.  You never, we never felt that it was because we were adopted it was difficult.  We could feel it because we did something stupid (laughter).  You know what I mean, like, race was not the core inside the family of the problem.  You know, if I stole my neighbor's kid's bike, I had to bring it back, you know, and she let me know and it was not okay.  It was not okay, and I maybe didn't, wasn't allowed to go out for a week.  That has nothing to do with being black.  That was just like, I did something stupid.  I shouldn't have done that, right?  So she was very much like this is not okay; and my father [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] was more different.  He saw it in race much more.  He said, "You're a black man.  You're gonna get judged and blamed completely different.  So you are not--we have to raise you in a different way."  I was not allowed to fight, and as a little kid you were, you wanted to fight back.  My father always knew, "You're gonna get blamed first.  They're gonna pick you out."  My mom fought a lot with him about that, but he was right.  He was hundre- my dad was 100 percent right.  So, I ended up not telling my mom you know because she just did not understand.  She just wanted to, like, go to school and argue with the teacher and just like, you don't want to do that.  You just want to go away but, you know, it happened in school all the time, when we'd start a new class.  Teacher always saw me and (unclear), "You should sit up front, I want to keep an eye on you."  They just never dealt with a black child so they just assumed like we need to protect him or we need to be on him in a different way.  If something got stolen, they always asked me first.  I'm like, "I don't (unclear)--I have my own stuff," (laughter).  You know, I had problems keeping my own stuff 'cause I always--I played soccer and just dropped my bag somewhere and just ran home.  I'm like, I'm not gonna steal some other kid's bag.  Like, what am I gonna do with that?  My mom would, you know, she'd beat the crap out of me if I would come home with another kid's things.  She was just like, "Who's this?  Where does she live?"  And I'd have to walk home and give it back, you know what I mean?  So that was never the issue.  It was--my parents were very strict, very strict parents.
Speaker 1: And, given that you obviously knew you were adopted, did it f- did it feel, what did it feel like?  You know, did you feel like they were your parents?
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely felt like they (unclear) (laughter) definitely.  There wasn't parent number two coming to help us, or survive.  You know, but as a young kid you have questions.  I remember being like twelve one time and I asked my mom like, "Are you guys going to divorce now?"  And she's like, "Why?  Why would you ask me that?"  Because that was the time when all my kid- you know, all the kids' parents in school--not all but I would say the majority, started to break up and divorce; and then, you know, they spent their weekends with their dad and then you know, and sometimes they had more toys because they got gifts from par- you know, both parents.  This was a very confusing time.  Maybe I wasn't twelve--maybe I was like ten or eleven or something like that, and I was like what's gonna happen.  How come we don't have two places to go to?  You know, it was just these type of things.  This is not, most of the time it is not racial, but the times that really defined it was racial.  Most of the time- things were just kid stuff growing up, but the things that put the tattoo on you for the rest of your life, were very deep tissue, racial, you know, very.

Speaker 1: I think we should talk about food now.  We're--so, at sixteen [years old], you decided that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you were going to take food seriously.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're still in high school.  What did taking food seriously look like?
Speaker 2: It means being devoted, being committed, fully committed; and it still means that, I've never sort of broken that vow, being committed.  And, you know, again, understanding that as a black person, as a black man, it was a separation, really big difference between me and my sisters [Linda Samuelsson and Anna Samuelsson] in terms of that I felt the pressure of, always felt the pressure that I have to provide the way my father [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] provided and how do you do that as a black man in a country where there is no black person that you're seeing that is middle class or working even.  How will this actually happen?  There's no path.  There's no person that you can look at.  Nobody.  So, I just knew that I had to be that much better--not a little bit, but a lot, a lot.  And I still know that--that I can't be average or good; I have to be much better.
Speaker 1: So, how did you plot that course?
Speaker 2: I, you know at sixteen I don't think you plot--I just knew and I knew it from soccer.  You know I, the black kids or the foreign kids, we never got judged the same--I mean never--so we knew that this is just something you know and you'll eventually also become okay with it because it just forces you to practice more; and so I said there is no difference with cooking.  And, I have receipts on all this.  I remember when I was sixteen I wanted to work at McDonald's.  It was like was the finest establishment you could work in and, you know, I know that look when I came in and the manager there is maybe nineteen, he's like three years older than you and he looks at, that look, any black person knows what that look is (gesture).  It's like a code: you know that's not gonna happen, you're not gonna get the job.  And then to go back and explain that to your mother [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson], to understand why, and she just wants to go down there (gesture) and talk to the manager and I'm like don't do it.  I'll just go and work somewhere else.  You know, and like being rejected from McDonald's is a hard thing because, like, you know McDonald's was the--you know, was everything, you know, for us.  So, but then, every door wasn't closed.  There was one guy who helped me get to a real restaurant, not McDonald's.  And, what I liked when I was in other restaurants, once you're working with labor, once they get over the shock that you're just a kid that want to work and nothing's gonna happen, right?  You're, you happen to be black but you're not gonna steal money from the bar, you're not gonna, you know, you're not gonna walk around dancing, you know, like you're not gonna, you know, just jump up on the table.  Like, you have manners and, you know, you have a sense of self.  The owners of those places always love that, because they're like, oh, this kid's gonna work.  So, and then once they saw that I was serious--work is honest.  So they were just like, off to the races.
Story_ID: 664735
Speaker 1: Where did you first work?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked in a local--small, tiny hotel, I worked in a small restaurant and they gave me tasks that maybe--the kids that I worked with did similar tasks.  They were like eighteen, nineteen, and I knew the work better than them because it was a lot of handling fish: opening oysters, cleaning salmon, peeling potatoes faster.  I peeled potatoes with my grandmother since I was six or seven years old.  I know exactly what not to waste, how to clean a potato, where the skin, what you can do with the skin, what you cannot do with the skin, how much skin you should take off.  They have no clue; and they didn't work with a purpose.  They were just there.  They were hanging out.  Cleaning fish, taking the bones out; how many fish can you clean within an hour, when the ice should go; when it starts smelling (gesture).  You know, smell of fish, it's not, you know, these are the things that they don't know because they were inlanders, so they were city kids.  I was from the water.
Speaker 1: Did you teach them?
Speaker 2: Ye- I, I worked fast, you know, by myself pretty much, and the, whoever was the lead chef, they saw that.  I came in, I never worked--worried about getting extra money or anything like that.  They gave me extra.  They didn't have to, and then one of them said, "I'm gonna take you to--," this restaurant [Belle Avenue] that was the finest establishment around.  It was where, when Diana Ross came to Gothenburg [Sweden], she stayed there.  When you know anything of like regal or royalty came, they stayed there, and they said, "You should work there," and I did.
Speaker 1: Where was that?
Speaker 2: It was at Park Avenue Hotel [SAS Park Avenue Hotel; Elite Park Avenue Hotel] in Gothenburg; and it was a magical place to work in.
Speaker 1: What made it magical?
Speaker 2: It had the tradition of old school so I could relay things to my grandmother.  You know when I was off, I sat with my grandmother and I talked to my grandmother and my grandfather very similar.  With my father--my grandfather, we talked about soccer games, what happened minute by minute.  My grandmother, I talked about what happened in the kitchen, what fish did you have, how did you prepare it, what sauce; how do you cook vegetables, what does it smell like?  It's minute by minute, you explain everything.  So, they, this place had a sense of tradition and regalness and royalness to it; and there were a lot of things I didn't understand.  Wines--I didn't understand wines.  I thought it was weird that you poured something with gloves on.  Michael Jackson was the only person that I knew with gloves (laughter).
Speaker 1: What was your role when you started at that?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was the lowest of the lowest--it was good.  I was a fish cleaning boy and I liked it.  It was great.  I remember the first time I started work there, I started at six o'clock in the morning; I was done at two o'clock in the morning.  I started at six o'clock in the morning, I was done at two a.m. and I was like, a week later, I can get everything done by, to nine o'clock at night, you know.  Maybe a month later, I could be done by four o'clock in the afternoon.  All the fish comes in, you have to take all the eyes out, you have to (gesture) take the skin off the fish, and you have to filet the fish, put it in new containers.  It's very heavy, it was very heavy, but you also have to be fine- very finesse.  You make fish stock--you take care of all the fish orders that come in; and by the time I was really had it down, I was done by two in the afternoon, which meant that I could go work in the meat station, so after--and I could do it by myself.  Before, there were two Swedish kids working there and they never get done.  They fool around, they put the old eyes wi- on top of the new fish.  You can't do that, then you ruin the fish.  But they didn't have a sense of purpose, and they didn't have to because their pass was already handed out to them.
Story_ID: 664736
Speaker 1: How long did you work at that restaurant [Belle Avenue, Gothenburg, Sweden]?
Speaker 2: All ri- I--my boss--which was very complex and very hard and very difficult, but was also very honest--he said to me, after about three weeks he said to me, "I'm gonna let you go in eighteen months.  If you keep working like this I'm gonna let you go in eighteen months," and I never really understood what that was, what that meant.  And, to the dot in eighteen months, to the minute, he said, "I'm gonna send you abroad now to another place."  You know, and he really kept his word.  He really did; and I wasn't, I couldn't take that job.  It was a job in Holland in Amsterdam [the Netherlands], and my father [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] didn't allow me to go to Amsterdam and I was so upset with him; and that was annoying, it was difficult to come back and--
Speaker 1: Why didn't he let you go?
Speaker 2: He didn't understand food, but he said, "Okay, if you're gonna advance in food, there's--are essentially two countries you can go to: France or Switzerland," 'cause he knew there were good schools in Switzerland and he knew of French food.  Holland, (shakes head) I--and maybe also what he knew was that Amsterdam was, you know, where there was a lot of drugs and stuff like that.  But I'm like, he, well he didn't know I was around drugs.  We were around drugs.  I just had no interest in it.  So, I told him--I didn't tell him because I didn't want him to even think about that, but his untold story was that he was worried for me and there was no focus on food there, and my untold story was if I wanted to do drugs at eighteen years old in Sweden, they were all around me.  That it's not--he couldn't protect me from that.  I just never had interest in it and it wouldn't help me, you know, in the past and the purpose that I was doing.
Speaker 1: So you didn't go to Holland--where did you go?
Speaker 2: Ye- you know, it was tough because, go back, look my boss in the eyes and not take it; and of course, the first thing he brought up was race.  The first thing he said, "Do you think there is going to come a lot of chances for you as a little black kid?"  And I was like--he was very honest, it was just too hard to take, because I felt we worked, I worked so hard on not have a race dialogue, but of course it was there every day.  But he was honest, you know he was brutally honest and six months later he sent me to Switzerland.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Tony Beaumont [ph.].  He really helped me, he was very helpful.  He is a very complex, very difficult, but he did help me.  And, and he showed me that this relationship between mentor-mentee is the key; and, you don't always have to be in agreement.  You have to see something, a pod, and he saw the pod in me, although this was very difficult for me.  He always said it, "Marcus [HistoryMaker Marcus Samuelsson], you have to realize, I'm a racist--I do not like your kind."  He was very clear about this.  "But, I'm also going to be fair.  The best kid will win; and you, by far, are the best."  He did not (unclear) (makes sound) are you kidding me?  But I had no problems actually with this, because he was clear, it was clear.  He didn't like foreigners--he needed foreigners to work, but he didn't like them.  But you knew.  Like, there's no--I didn't worry about, you know, does he--where does he stand.  He just didn't like you.  He liked your work; and I'm sure it was painful for him to even give me the chance, but he was also very honest and said, "No, the best kid's gonna win, gonna get this."  'Cause he said, also, "That kid is not gonna embarrass me."  He needed me to do well in order so he can send other kids.  He just didn't think the other kids were focused.
Story_ID: 664737
Speaker 1: You went to Switzerland to what restaurant and at what time?
Speaker 2: I was eighteen, going on nineteen [years old].  I went to Switzerland to learn--really further my education in food; and, you know, it's to a hotel called Victoria Jungfrau [Victoria Jungfrau Grand Hotel and Spa, Interlaken, Switzerland], which then and still is one of the leading hotels of the world.  It's an incredible facility.  You know, if I thought Park Avenue [SAS Park Avenue Hotel; Elite Park Avenue Hotel] in Gothenburg [Sweden] was the world, you know, this was just a different league.  This is basically Waldorf Astoria in the mountains.  I mean, the village was Victoria Jungfrau.  The, where you got your linen from, they work for Victoria, the (unclear) person who picked the apples worked for Victoria.  This was everyone in the village was embedded with the hotel, so the general manager, he, essentially, mayor of that city, that village.
Speaker 1: And your job when you started was?
Speaker 2: I--it's called commis de cuisine, so essentially you're a helper in the kitchen.  But I didn't start in the kitchen.  I started in the garden.  It's an eighteen month program where you move stations every three months; and you start in the garden, pick vegetables, which also was not difficult for me because we had a garden growing up.  So, I knew when to pick things in season.
Speaker 1: So was this like an internship?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it paid, though?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they paid us a little bit.  You know, a little bit to get by, and you know.  But it was never about money.  You know, I think that's the difference when you're a middle class kid--the difference between my parents [Samuelsson's adoptive parents, Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson] that were poor and a middle class kid.  I never had money, but I was never out of money.  It's a big difference--big, big, big difference.  So that meant that I had enough money to do what I had to do to further my education.  A poor kid doesn't even have that.  So, my parents never gave me a lot of money, they just gave me enough to get by.  The rest, I had to work for, so I had, you know, whatever maybe they gave me, maybe I made two hundred francs, Swiss franc a week, which you know, I paid for a room; I had to clean my, you know, clean your clothes.  We ate at the hotel.  It's not like you went and spend money on dinner.  When you were off, you slept, you were tired.
Speaker 1: Now, where did you live?
Speaker 2: I mean, we lived in the, you know, in the house quarters way behind the hotel (laughter).
Speaker 1: It was all part of the--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean you owed (makes sound) but in, not in a bad way.  Like, they taught you everything.  You don't think about obviously the kid that spoke a little bit of English and a little bit of German.  There, you have to speak French, you have to speak fluent German.  You have to take care of yourself, take care of your roommate.  Together, they can come and check your room at any given time.  If your room wasn't up to snuff, (makes sound) you got sent home.  If your tie wasn't tied properly, got sent home.  If you didn't polish your shoes the right way, you got sent home.  If you got drunk in a bar down the street, you got sent home.  They owned the city--the village.  If you didn't behave when you went nuts on another person's property they found out, home.
Speaker 1: Did that happen to some of your friends?
Speaker 2: Most of them.  We were sixty kids coming in by the beginning of the summer.  We were maybe ten, twelve left by the end of the season.
Speaker 1: Did you ever get in trouble?
Speaker 2: I got a little bit in trouble but not in major trouble, you know, and I also knew, again, blackness saved me.  I knew that I--I'm a double, right: I'm an immigrant--I'm a Swedish immigrant, and I'm an African immigrant to them.  Right?  So, I have no, I can't even go near trouble because (gesture) if it was hard to send the German coming home or the French coming home, they would not think twice about sending me home.  But it was clear.  There's no, there's no issue for me, so you knew that, you know.  But it's, it's also helped you shape what you do and you don't play with fire.
Story_ID: 664738
Speaker 1: After eighteen months [at the Victoria Jungfrau Grand Hotel and Spa, Interlaken, Switzerland], what happened there?
Speaker 2: What happened?  That, I mean, at that time it was an--it was a really good time for me.  I learned a lot, enormous amount.  I failed a lot, but I learned a lot.  I went through every station: garden, pastry, fish, meat, butchering, cold kitchen.  They were very fair.  They were very diffi- it was very hard because if you knew you had to speak German, they switched it to French.  It was all about the setup, about confusing you.  If you did something they wanted to set you up to fail.  The other kids, I mean they're like three years older than you, four years older than you and it's very competitive; but there was also community--camaraderie and community.  After eighteen months, they offered me a job but you have to leave Switzerland for your permits, so I left.  I left to Austria and it was great for me to go to Austria because I could continue to speak German, continue my pastry studies; and then eventually to come back to Switzerland.
Speaker 1: So, in order to accept the job there, you had to leave first.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know it's almost like a Green Card, right.  You have to, you have to get stamped then you are truly a gastarbeiter, right; you're a guest worker, which means when your permit is up, "Thank you very much, now leave."  There is no (laughter) there's no gray zone, but they give you a new one.  It just worked like that: you'd have to leave the country.
Speaker 1: So in that kitchen, you said you started with sixty--
Speaker 2: Commis [commis de cuisine]--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) young people, and, and it shrunk, it shrank to ten.  Can you describe what it looked like in that kitchen?  Like who's there?
Speaker 2: Chef--there's the top, right.  You don't look Chef in the eye.  He's like fine folk.  You don't look him in the eye.  You see him, you cross hallway.  You move her out, you do not--.  Then you have his sous chef, which has a brigade of maybe ten chefs--all men; Swiss, French, German.  You know, it was a very hard time for me but it was also very good.  You know, I--this is you know this in different languages.  You see your friends being fired every day for minor, minor stuff.  Maybe they looked someone in the eye, maybe they didn't clean the knives properly--(makes sound) out.  So, I developed this, you know, I started to throw up every day.  I got very nervous, you know, you got very nervous.  You just wait for your number to get called.  There was lineup every day.  They could pull you out of lineup; they can have you do something and if you didn't manage it--(claps hands), you're out.  So, it's very tough, but I also managed to deal with my sickness.  I knew how to run to the bathroom, throw up, wash myself off; come back without no one noticing.  You get very fast in this--you're like, you know, like it's a process that, you know, I can only relate to maybe--other, you know like women knows, men knows that have been in combative situations, they know how to deal with it.  No one would know.  They have to hold in so much and that's what we did.  I mean, my friends, hardworking kids from all over the world, one guy, he just cut his finger off on the saw; I mean, you needed out.  Some of them couldn't do it.  One guy cut himself on purpose in the hand.  One guy came in high, with sunglasses, smoked weed [marijuana], so they knew that they would get fired.  You know, they just couldn't--they'd just bust, you know.  And the other chef, they knew, this is--they have sixty kids by the beginning of the summer, they're going to have fifteen to twenty when it--by the end of summer.  So they just knew how, who's gonna stand that.  It's like army life.
Story_ID: 664739
Speaker 1: Marcus [HistoryMaker Marcus Samuelsson], in this kitchen [at the Victoria Jungfrau Grand Hotel and Spa, Interlaken, Switzerland] were there any other p- black people or people of color at all (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.  Yeah, I mean there were, one girl--one guy from Singapore.  He was Asian.  A couple of Japanese kids, they were, you know, from major Japanese hotels; but I mean blackness didn't ex- I mean you, it's something you, it doesn't, it didn't exist.  There's no reference point--no reference point.  The darkest people was maybe the Portuguese kids you know, that had dash of piri piri in them--a dash.
Speaker 1: So being the only one, what was that experience like for you?
Speaker 2: I mean, I've been the only one at so many times as a lot of black professionals are, so I share that with you and you have a different past--but I share, I know, just knowing you, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], that you have been in those situations, so you just have to multiply that by years.  So, there is a mechanism that you go through to protect, but I took it as I just have to work harder.  I never relaxed and that's why I threw up every day, because I just knew that--but it was rewarding in other ways too, because they saw how hard I worked, and they promoted me and there was--I never saw that coming.  So, it was there but I never, you know, my sense of blackness was maybe through--I had a Sony Walkman and it was through the music that my sister [Lisa Samuelsson], the tapes that my sister send down, the CDs [compact disc], you know that my sister sent down like Living Colour was popular.  Maybe she, you know, she sent that to me.  I had, you know, she sent like a New Edition album to me or you know something like that.  I lived it through Spike Lee's movie, 'Do the Right Thing' 'cause there--it didn't show it in Interlaken [Switzerland], it showed, they showed him in Bern [Switzerland].  You know, so I'd have to go to Bern to see 'Do the Right Thing' and it was, you're not going to live on that for the whole summer, to see, you know, let's say, it was '91 [1991], so was 'Jungle Fever' maybe, maybe was 'Jungle Fever."  So these things, iconic things, become--you know, I watch the fact that Dinkins [HistoryMaker David N. Dinkins] became mayor in New York [New York], and that was a big deal to me because that was an eye opener; it was like, whoa, wait a minute, is that a black mayor in New York City? It was the first black professional anywhere that I saw.
Speaker 1: Where did you see it?
Speaker 2: I read in the newspaper, that it was a black mayor in New York City.  I never, you know because the only black people that I knew was in the entertainment field, right, sports or music.  I didn't know them, whether it was Carl Lewis or Prince or Run-DMC or Spike.  There was--I had no reference point to a black person working, lawyer, doctor, writer--no reference points.  So I had some because my dad [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] gave me sort of Langston [Langston Hughes] and, you know, Baldwin [James Baldwin] and that stuff, but I didn't have a reference point as a person that I saw in front of me that I could relate to, so seeing this picture I was like whoa. What does that say about the white people?  I thought it was amazing to have that much trust in a black person.  I thought it was like whoa.  So that was my first cue and I was like, hm.  If New York can accept a black mayor, they will accept a black chef.  And that was the first time I thought okay, I probably have to move to America, which my father always thought I would do.  He always said that.
Speaker 1: This was in '91 [1991]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '90 [1990], '91 [1991], when Dinkins and--it was a very confusing time because it was also the time of the riots in L.A. [Watts, Los Angeles, California]; it was a time of, you know during this whole time, early '90s [1990s], you know, rap just went through this you know, Public Enemy, which I looked into a lot and it was also a time of Bensonhurst here in Ameri- in New York, so I saw it as the biggest time of diversity but at yet it was boiling inside, right.  But these are all key pillars to why we--even possible to think about that we can have a black president.  All of that time--Dinkins, all of that stuff--Rodney King--all of that is the basement for that.
Story_ID: 664740
Speaker 1: As these things are occurring, where are you now?
Speaker 2: I'm still in Switzerland--I'm in Austria, I'm in Switzerland, I'm in Austria.  I'm in the middle of Europe and I know that I've got to move.  I've got to go abroad; and then eventually I'm waiting to get to France.  That's like the big thing to me, to go to France.  And it's what really started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What got you to France?
Speaker 2: My work, but also a mentor that eventually--I wrote to--thirty-five, thirty-five times I wrote to French restaurants, three star Michelin [Michelin Guide] restaurant and I got no every single time.  One time I got yes.  I took the train all the way to France and then I got the look of that guy looking at me like--looked at the resume, he said, "[HistoryMaker] Marcus Samuelsson," he expected a Swedish kid, he looked at me and he says, "C'est pas possible; you can't go," and I'm there, I have the job, and he said it's not possible, and I have to leave.  I have to go thirty-five hours back on the train again.  So, that was probably the deepest and toughest time for me.  'Cause you know, it was so embarrassing, you know.  It's like, embarrassing to tell my mom [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson], and you know, there's nothing she can do.  We worked so hard, me and my mother, in getting this.  There is nothing she could do.  It was like, there was no one to call and it was the beginning of me leaving to America, and I was right.  That was the one thing I knew I had been right about is that Europe at that time still--not still, but Europe at that time was not ready to have a black professional that wanted to add value in terms of culture context, and that you would have an audience come and pay for it.  It wasn't aid, we weren't there to help.  We were there to add it, our narrative.  And the French were also very honest.  That's why I've never really had major issues with racists because they are very clear when--I remember my exit interview in France when they said to me, "What do you want to do?  We have a new contract for you.  You can come and work for free for another year."  And I said, "No, I can't do that--I wanna open my own restaurant on this level, a three star."  They're like (shakes head), "You want to work in a three star restaurant?"  "No I want to eventually open my own three star."  "C'est pas possible; it's not possible--you know that's not possible, Marcus."  And I was like, "Well I'm gonna do that."  "Well, you know it's not gonna happen."  "Well, okay.  We don't have to sit here and argue back and forth.  I know I'm not gonna work here anymore, and I know I have to go," and.
Speaker 1: How old were you then?
Speaker 2: At that point, I was twenty-three.  You know, and I achieved my goal.  I worked in a three star Michelin restaurant [Georges Blanc Restaurant, Vonnas, France].  I did very well.  They offered me another contract.  They were very kind to me.  He was just very realistic.  It was almost like a fatherly figure saying, "I don't want you to leave here and go out in the world and think that that's gonna happen, 'cause that's clearly, it's unattainable."  He tried to protect me, 'cause he's saying, like there's no audience that's gonna come to a black chef.
Speaker 1: What made you think differently?  Believe that you could do it?
Speaker 2: Because at that point, I'd proven so many times--I've survived the hard work in Switzerland, I survived all the humilia- you know, the humiliation in France, and also what I learned.  I survived and did well in Austria, both with all difficulties that happened on my personal side and I just knew that I have to go.
Story_ID: 664741
Speaker 1: Have to go.
Speaker 2: What difficulties?
Speaker 1: Well, it was, this was a very difficult time, challenging time for so many different reasons, you know, I--you know it was just a very difficult time in my, my, both my grandparents passed away and it was joy, it was up and (gesture) (makes sounds) which happens, you know.  I could never go to one of the funerals 'cause I was working and I was not allowed to leave--and, the joy, and it was also a lot of joy.  My nieces and nephews were born and I had never been to any of their, when they were born or christening (unclear).  And my daughter [Zoe Samuelsson] was born, which was a very challenging time but also filled with mixed emotions for me but also a lot of joy, you know.  I just became that person I didn't wanna become--that black father figure that was not there.  So, I just became the stereotype that I was raised not to be, so I felt I failed myself and my parents [Samuelsson's adoptive parents, Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson] a lot, which was a very difficult time.
Speaker 2: I first learned about your daughter through your book ['Yes, Chef: A Memoir,' Marcus Samuelsson with Veronica Chambers] when you share that, I think a lot of people didn't know that you had a child.  When you made the decision to continue with your career and not be family there, can you describe that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I can describe it very well, I mean--
Speaker 2: And how old were you?
Speaker 1: I was very young, like twenty-one, twenty-two.  You know, this is a time where, different time but also in a different culture, different country, and my daughter's mother just told me, in, we spoke German, she told me she's pregnant.  I knew, I mean, she's Catholic girl like I knew her culture, her background, you know.  And she just said that, you know, "Me and my family, we're going to raise our child," and you know, it's, I was very intimidated and scared about the whole situation.  I saw my dream of being this cook disappearing.  I saw my parents and everything they taught me in terms of taking care of myself, how I'm gonna ever, you know, tell my mother.  That was very challenging.  And I thought, how will she take care of the child?  You know and she was very clear about it.  We talked very briefly, but she was like, "I have a strong family here and we will take care of it."  And then I said, "Well, I have to continue my journey and work; you know, I have to work.  This is my path."  And she knew.  I mean, everyone that knew me at that time, they knew that this is the path.  You know, it's a commitment, it's a choice that you do very early in life.  That, it's not even beyond, you can't compare and describe it to regular people because it's al- it's, it's beyond a job; you know, it's a commitment.  All chefs know.  The real chefs know.  Real, real chefs know.  So, it was a very difficult time.  It was time for pause; go home, describe to my parents what happened and own up and face reality and face responsibilities that I maybe was not ready to face at that time, but my sisters [Linda Samuelsson and Anna Samuelsson] and my mom and my parents were.  So, you know it's tribal.  I'm here because of a lot of people.  My, I'll go back to that, a lot of people are representative in the reasons why I can sit here with you, it's a teamwork and tribal and cross-countries, cross-cultures--it's very complex.
Story_ID: 664742
Speaker 1: When you came to America, was it through Aquavit?
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Can you describe when and how that happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it happened early '90s [1990s].  I was writing to get, go to America and I knew of this restaurant called Aquavit in New York City [New York, New York]; and I was, you know, I've always had this level of being naive, but also I believed in it so I wrote to the three people that I knew in America, which was Oprah Winfrey and David Letterman (laughter).  I, like, I wrote the same letter to both.  Like, "Hey, if you hire me, I can open a restaurant for you and it will be a top ten restaurant," and I believed, like, why not?  She's on TV, she has money, she needs to--she knows food.  Well, she should know food, about food; and David Letterman was more like, that's the other American that I knew; and then the third one was, who became my business partner and opened another door for me, Hakan Swahn, that started the restaurant Aquavit, and he's like, who is this guy?  And he looked at my resume and he did a couple of phone calls, like, we're definitely gonna bet on this kid.  And he did.  He did give me a chance and I worked in New York; and I knew right, not right away, but after like three hours that I'm not moving.  It was--you know, New York has a smell and a noise and an energy that you either dig or don't, right?  It's like going in the woods.  You either like the woods or you don't.  It's like sailing in the ocean.  You either like the salt or you don't.  You like that pulse; and for me it's like it was home.  It was like right away, I knew.  Everything, everything that I looked for was.  And the other thing that I felt that New York had, or didn't have, was when you go to a city like Paris [France] or Lyon [France], food is almost perfection.  New York in the early '90s [1990s], it was imperfect in terms of food.  It was harder to find good bread, it was harder to find good cheese.  There was not this incredible neighborhood restaurants all over, all over the city.  So, the fact that it was imperfect, I saw it a great opportunity.  I'm like, I can just work here.  It's multicultural and I'm going to do very well here if I work hard. Just get, give me a seat at the table, just get me in.
Speaker 1: And, what, what did you do at Aquavit when you came?
Speaker 2: I came, I mean very simple as an intern first and just did taste it out, tried out, and right away.  But I had other jobs lined up for me so I had to leave; and eventually, before I left after six months, Hakan said, "If you want a job back you can get it and we can work on your papers and we can get it right away."  And I knew right there--I didn't want to say yes right away because I just needed to think about it, but I knew that I would come back and ask for that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So was it the same thing, you had to leave the country in order to get your papers just like in Switzerland?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean immigration and--it's a very complex issue but, you know, like most immigrants you work twice as hard.  Very few immigrants are the core of the problem.  Immigrants w- have worked so hard to get here, most of them, they're not going to screw up, they're not--including myself.

Speaker 1: Coming to New York City, you're now in a place where there are lots of people who look like you, and, I mean the- every kind of person is in New York [New York].  What was the experience like for you culturally and also just in terms of back to tone?
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, New York had, you know I had a vision that I wrote down in Sweden was that I feel I will do better whether as an Indian psychiatrist, Chinese journalist, a black lawyer, and a white, other professional, right.  That scenario, I like that.  Could be Jewish, because I just knew that in those narratives it's gonna be the content that you do, and New York had that.  I mean, even the bus ride from JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York], the bus driver was black, the person next to me was Indian; someone--I didn't know even the difference between Puerto Rican and Dominican, though someone Latin in front of me, speaking Spanish.  It was just this bus ride was just filled with noise and people eating on the bus, I'm like eating on the bus?  What is that?  I've never eaten on a bus, ever--ever.  That was one of the first things, I called my mom [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson] and said about it, "People are walking and eating, they drink coffee and they walk."  "What do you mean they're walking and eating?  They're not sitting down?"  "No, they're walking and eating." I've never seen this.  At this point, I worked with food all my life.  I never seen this, twenty-four ye- twenty-three years old, but I liked it.
Speaker 1: And, as one who had been the only, did you feel any different now that you weren't?
Speaker 2: Oh, I loved coming here, I loved not--I could just melt in and--the other thing that happened right away was that no one looked at me as Swedish. They saw this Ethiopian man, which I wasn't really accustomed to at that--Ethiopia was so far away from me and then started to scream words like, Habesha or Ethiopia or Haile Selassie.  You met Jamaicans on the street selling weed.  They were like, "Oh, Haile, Haile, Haile," and I was like, you know, they were referring to me as Ethiopian and I loved that.  I lived in the East Village; you know, I lived on St. Mark's [St. Mark's Place], which is probably the busiest street you can live on in New York when it comes to noise and herbs and whatever it is, but I loved it.  It wasn't noisy to me, you know.  It was just a great--energetic.  I lived in the Lower East Side [New York, New York] for a long time and I liked it; and this is, I never lived in a place like this--you know, I think I had four roommates; in Switzerland I only had one roommate.  You have to like, set up times when you have to go use the bathrooms, and but I liked it all.  I roller skated to work, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, you are the, East Village in the Lower East Side--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and in those neighborhoods at that time, there's a lot of drugs--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and it's also pretty gay, isn't it?
Speaker 2: It was black, it was gay, it was open, it was drugs--but I, I liked all of that stuff.  Be- I mean, I've known, at this point I always knew when there--well I used to say--before I went to bed I used to sit on the stairs outside and the drug dealers used to drop--their drop off was our staircase--and it's like if you don't mess with them, they don't mess with you; and I had nothing, you know they were, they just came, they did their drop off, somebody came to pick it up--it was clearly how they did it.  So it's part of--those were my doormen.  You know, the hooker that worked that block, she was a doorman for us.  You know, she knows--, "Hey, what's up Marcus [HistoryMaker Marcus Samuelsson]?"  It was a very (gesture)--in my mind this can be very scary, like I would never take my mom on that block, ever.  But, it was also the, New York, you know, and I was prepared for that.  Yeah, people were, looked different and weird but I think most of them look good, you know?  (Unclear) fit, you know, like cool looking, like--you know, I remember I was speaking back, I remember I was here during gay pride, the first gay pride that I saw and I was referring to a flag, you know, with all the rainbow flag and I said, "Mom, they have a flag.  There's a flag," this was during gay pride.  And my mom was like, "But how can they have a flag when they don't have a country?"  I said, "Mom, I don't know," (laughter).  "Well then, they don't have a flag."  Well I said, "There is a flag.  I mean--can I take a picture and send you pictures of it?"  So we had all these--there were so many things that she couldn't understand about New York at that time and the energy in where I lived.  But we, so we had these very intimate conversations.
Story_ID: 664744
Speaker 1: You go back to Aquavit [New York, New York], at what point; and what happens there?
Speaker 2: I get, I get hired as a sous chef at Aquavit and I'm twenty-three years old and I started working with a young chef, wonderful chef; and you know, at that time, New York [New York] is live, you know restaurant industry is very much like 'Kitchen Confidential' ['Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly']--the way Tony [Anthony Bourdain] describes it.  There's a bunch of misfits that work really, really hard and party really, really hard; and I just came from France and I was like, I wanna work on the food and then I wanna go home.  I can have a drink with my friends but then I wanna go home.  I wanna come back the next day and work.  But, you know, the guys that I work there party hard, including Chef; and about three weeks into it he dies of an overdose.  He dies.
Speaker 1: And what does that mean for you?
Speaker 2: Well, it meant a lot of sadness and confusion first, a lot of confusion, what's gonna happen; I just got here; what's gonna happen to this place; how could it happen--how could this person I was speaking to yesterday die?  This is the second person in my cooking career that dies that is my age that I was close to.  In Switzerland my friend died in a car accident--my roommate, my very good friend.  This is the second person, what the hell is this, you know?  This is very devastating.  You know, so it's like rocky.  So, we closed the restaurant for a couple of days and then we just, Hakan [Hakan Swahn] said we gotta keep the restaurant open, so we all just start to work; and since I was a sous chef with another guy, we started to slowly take over the kitchen with the intent of Hakan's gonna come back with a new chef.  But, in the meantime, you know the word gets out (unclear) and there are chefs coming in, looking at it, and about--this happened February, so around May, it was going on three months and we were working really hard and we don't have a chef yet, I ask Hakan, "Who's going to become the new chef?  Because you know, spring is here and we've gotta start planning the new menu."  He said, "You are."  I said, "What?  I'm twenty-three," at the time.  He said "You're gonna be the chef."  I was very nervous.  I didn't--I'm like--hm.  I needed to take a break and think about that because Aquavit was a very famous restaurant--especially in Sweden, and I didn't wanna be the one to close the restaurant, twenty-three years old, that could stamp you for the rest of your life, because I didn't know where it was going.  I had no clue.  And, but also as you do when you're young--and I think it's also something that, as men that we do very often too, is we don't have all the answers, but it doesn't matter.  We can just jump up and do one of these (gesture), a pull up, that is probably way above your weight, but through work, luck, and a lot of different things, we say yes as very often where women very often actually, very often, "No, I'm not ready yet," and are--women are very often much better prepared than men and as men, very often--and this couldn't be good or bad, I'm not saying one is better than the other, and women want to prepare themselves and are much better in that; and we think, you know what?  I'm gonna fix it.  Not having--I didn't know about food costs, I didn't know how to manage people, I didn't know how to--I had one thing, I had a skill and a craft--that's two things--but not developed enough to be a chef.  So, I took it and did the thing that I've always known, is to work very, very hard; and at that point I've been writing food for a very long time, so I had lots of ideas.  It's like, you know, it's like, young artist, like when Lenny Kravitz comes out with that first album ['Let Love Rule']; or when Prince came out with that first album ['For You'].  Like, it's so good, how can this young person come out with something that is that complex and that well developed?  Because I've been writing food since I was sixteen years old.  I just needed somebody to edit it out for me, the bad stuff.
Story_ID: 664745
Speaker 1: What was the cuisine at Aquavit [New York, New York] when you started; and how did it change when you became the chef?
Speaker 2: Well it's (unclear) the cuisine at Aquavit was very Scandinavian.  We are traditional Swedish, very Scandinavian; and it changed in the fact that I didn't look at Swedish food as just being held--kept back by tradition.  I looked at Swedish food, and I still do, as what do we have that makes us unique, right?  So, I started to think about, well we have three types of water and they're all clear waters, so that makes us different.  We have rivers, we have lakes, big lakes, and we have ocean.  That's for us to have incredible type of seafood, mixed type of seafood, and we do have that.  We also have a unique relationship to nature--that all nature is public land, so people can go out, that means that we are different when it comes to foraging berries in a sense of what's game, game meats, root vegetables, all have a sense of game, and seafood becomes key.  Other things that we also have is, pickling, preserving techniques that are different than others.  Other countries pickle and preserve too, but we pickle with salt and have a little bit different acidity; so we have our pickling preserve, and we have a game, we have a seafood.  Then, our aesthetic, it is different.  When I look at the minimalistic design in a lens of light, so we have an aesthetic that are very different, we're pickling, preserving, we have our game, and we have our seafood.  Now, out of that I can build a cuisine.  So, I didn't have to have salmon to cure--I can take tuna if that's the freshest.  I didn't have to pickle herring--I could pickle a piece of beef if I wanted to.  I could pair it with cranberries instead of lingonberries.  I can plate it in a beautiful minimalistic way; and I can reduce balsamic vinegar, which also has acidity almost like syrup.  So now, I can brush stroke and start to create my aesthetically beautiful cuisine that has complexity in layers way beyond gravlax and meatballs.  So, this is a cuisine that--food travels two different ways, right?  A couple of different ways.  Massive population, like India and China; massive tourism like France and Italy; huge immigration like Mexico, like to our country.  Sweden has neither, we have 9 million people, a lot of people don't go to Sweden--we don't, so we don't have all those things.  We don't trade a lot with Sweden, so how would Americans know this cuisine?  I felt that that was an opportunity, as long as this was terroir, I could tell a story about who you were.  So, my goal was very early, like, for people to come to the restaurant and feel like through my food that they traveled to Sweden and back, but just never left Manhattan [New York], 'cause that is essentially what you did when you went to a three star Michelin [Michelin Guide] restaurant.  You were transported for those three hours.  And I'm like I've done that, I'm trained in that way, I can do that; and I did it with a vanity that my mom [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson] taught me, because in food you need vanity.
Story_ID: 664746
Speaker 1: I think many people learned--other than Swedish meatballs, that one dish, learned about Swedish food through Ikea--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --(laughter) because you know they have the little restaurant in Ikea?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: So the, the bridge to three star [Michelin Guide]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --compared to like Ikea would be like McDonald's in terms of that food awareness.  Who was coming through the restaurant experiencing this food?
Speaker 2: Well, Aquavit [New York, New York], you know, being, pretty re- early realized being in Midtown Manhattan in an iconic Rockefeller townhouse, the world came--half a block away from MOMA [Museum of Modern Art, New York, New York], the world came: the bankers, the foodies, the lawyers, the tourists--the world.  I could speak to--I cooked for Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton]; I could speak to a young [HistoryMaker] Thelma Golden; I could speak to a black banker, I didn't know that there was such a thing.  I remember meeting Ray McGuire [HistoryMaker Raymond J. McGuire] for the very first time; I could speak to just young cooks that spent all of her money or his money and just ate in our bar because they heard about this place.  I met chefs like Charlie Trotter that opened the way for me.  So, the world came.  It was very diverse--it is very diverse.  And, if you have a narrative and a point of view they see that.  New Yorkers and Americans are very excited for you if you present quality in a narrative; they're gonna push you.  I mean, this is before Internet, this is before Facebook, before Google.  This was word of mouth--truly word of mouth.  There's no email blast.  There's like, you gotta earn it.  And I liked it, it's honest, very honest work.
Story_ID: 664747
Speaker 1: I remember Aquavit [New York, New York] when you--I, I must, it must have been after you first came--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) because that's when I learned about the restaurant and there were a group of us--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --African American professionals--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --who came because you were there.
Speaker 2: Well, it was more than that.  You can't--that's not even--you can't even say that fast.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I am, I was there and cooking very much because of the fifty black professionals that came.  Never came in groups.  The table set was, looked very similar.  There was a table of four or six, there were three people that were either white or Jewish; and then there was one black, young professional at that table that I kind of like--right away, you almost had the look that I talked about before, but it was the opposite look, so I knew how hard she or he had worked to get that seat.  Expense account?  What?  That's like I knew, so we started to send out--acknowledge the black person in the restaurant, because I knew how difficult.  So, and then the support came from those fifty, and that was the legacy, that was, that was the building block of the tribe; and, again, it goes back to terroir and tribe, no different than my father's tribe [Amhara] today, and sticking together.  And I had food, someone had writing, another person had photography.  Someone got in on a bank, someone was a lawyer, someone knew somebody that, you know, was an engineer; (makes sounds) and that's how it started for a lot of us in the mid-'90s [1990s], the late '90s [1990s] and eventually to 2000, when essentially Internet broke it for everyone so the playing field became a tad more even--just a tad more, just a step.
Story_ID: 664748
Speaker 1: When did you begin getting press recognition of your work?
Speaker 2: You know, we got press pretty early.  The first nine months it was nothing, of me being a chef.  Then, Ruth Reichl gave us three stars; and Aquavit [New York, New York] came from a one star review to a three star review.
Speaker 1: Ruth Reichl's from The New York Times--
Speaker 2: Ruth Reichl, New York Times gave us a three star review; and I was twenty-three, almost twenty-four at the time, and I was the youngest person ever, still to this day, and--I shouldn't say that.  All records are meant to be broke, but I don't--it's a very hard record to break, because to get three stars is a lifetime achievement; and it was, it was the first thing I thought about.  I thought about Pat- Patrick Clark, actually, and I knew how hard Patrick worked and had to work.  Patrick Clark was the leading African American chef in the country at that time, and he's offered his services and his knowledge to me many, many times and at that point--
Speaker 1: Where was he at that time?
Speaker 2: Patrick had just started at Tavern on the Green, you know, iconic Central Park restaurant, and is a New York [New York] institution.  And Patrick knew everybody, but Patrick was not about to just hand it over to me or anything like that.  It's like you've gotta earn it like everybody else, but I will look out for you, you know.  We were planning a Clinton dinner that he was in charge of.  He needed me for that, and I willingly helped him with that.  He always talked to me about his son, Preston [Preston Clark], so, you know.
Speaker 1: And excuse me, is this when Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] was in office?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.  This definitely when Clinton was in office.  So, I got three stars and I knew that no black person ever had and still haven't beside myself; and it was twenty years ago, it's crazy, actually even thought process, crazy; but it's the truth.  It's crazy (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did the, and did the traffic change in the restaurant?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean that whole idea of you didn't know before--I'm gonna be busy today--oh, it's bad weather today, we're gonna be busy tomorrow 'til like, boom (snaps fingers). The phone was just ringing, we were busy right away, every day, every day, every day, for a very, very, very, very long time.  And then, all of a sudden I have to start to impress almost every day!  And it was a way for me, actually, I grew up right away in one day--I just (makes sound).  And, ever since that, ever since that day in September in '95 [1995], I've done some type of interview or taken some type of pictures every day since 1995, and very much linked to that first article.  Now, I know clearly--because cooking is humbling and through my parents [Samuelsson's adoptive parents, Ann Marie Samuelsson and Lennart Samuelsson] and--I knew right away that this was not a bus stop.  This was the beginning.  You know, this success is not a bus stop, okay I have now arrived.  Now I know--don't have to do anything.  This was the opportunity to start going to work for real.
Story_ID: 664749
Speaker 1: What did you do with that opportunity?
Speaker 2: I, I immersed myself and really started to think about how to develop a cuisine, a real cuisine that had gravitas.  And it's very hard to develop cuisine when you're twenty-four, twenty-five years old and you've gotta do it in front of people and people are tasting and pe- you've got a charge on that and sometimes you do--so there were a lot of bad dishes that became what I am today.  But also a lot of good ones.  I started looking at vegetarian food differently.  Always singled out--I'm like, what if you're the vegetarian.  Why should you just have another spinach salad?  So we started to make tasting menus in '96 [1996].  We put vegetarian tasting menus, twelve course menus 'cause I didn't want vegetarians to eat different.  So, we were very liberated by trying things; and as we became better and better, I have to edit, but I didn't want to edit it so the joy of food got out.  So, that foll- a lot of things followed.  I got picked as best young chef in America and I wanted the stigma of young and black to eventually go away, and it does.  Not, not--young does, black doesn't, but, you know.  Greatness also doesn't go away.  You have to work hard at it.  So--it just is.
Speaker 1: At what point did the James Beard Award [James Beard Foundation Award] come to you?
Speaker 2: Ninety-nine [1999].  It was when I was twenty-eight, twenty-nine--twenty-eight.
Speaker 1: You were still at Aquavit [New York, New York] at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Now on getting the James Beard Award, it was a very unique time 'cause I didn't know, I didn't know any of that stuff that much.  I didn't.  I mean, New York Times [The New York Times], I read it every day but I didn't know--there were no blogs so it was also--bloggers, there was traditional media, New York Times, New York Magazine, Zagat's guide, Crain's [Crain's New York Business]--they were traditional media, so there wasn't that much that was in my, front of me.  There were the magazines, you know, but in food I just don't go on TV.  Food Network just started.  You walked over there, maybe once a month, and you did something on 'Ready... Set... Cook!' or you spoke to Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover that was--she was a very nice lady and she was always encouraging, and it wasn't a thing.  But then, when, I remember around 2000, after winning the James Beard, you know people started to ask me, "You should do a TV show," and, I went, well, what is that?  I didn't know that, like--but I knew that I had to express my, I have to make my narrative sticky.  But the highest thing you can do as a young--as a chef was to be allowed to do your own cookbook, and that's all I wanted to do; and I got a chance to do that, so I started to work on my cookbook.
Speaker 1: Which was your first?
Speaker 2: 'Aquavit'--new Scandinavian cooking ['Aquavit: And the New Scandinavian Cuisine,' Marcus Samuelsson].
Story_ID: 664750
Speaker 1: During this time, Marcus [HistoryMaker Marcus Samuelsson], while you are building Aquavit [New York, New York], you're getting press, the attention is growing dramatically.  What is your social life like?
Speaker 2: I mean, socially it's been, it was--I'm always, I've always been a very happy kid, but it was a lot of things that happened, you know, like life.  My father [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] passed away so at the same time as I'm in the happiest in my professional life, my father passed.  It was very hard--it was very, very hard to take.  It's the hardest thing I've gone through 'cause he was always the guider for me and, you know, where my mom [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson] was always been love, you know I love my father in a different way, but he was not loving in the same way as my mom was loving, you know.  He was a very traditional man but he always looked out for me; and I, every time there was a choice I have to make, you know, he was, we talked, and now I knew that that didn't happen and I couldn't be even at the funeral, and it was just tough.  There was a lot of emotions.  You know it was like, emotions of being in New York [New York], being far away from--I felt separated from my family, my daughter [Zoe Samuelsson] over there, having deal with that chapter in my life.  I was not emotionally ready to be with anyone but with food, so I caved in to food.
Speaker 1: So, did you--were you not on the scene at all, going to social (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, I lived in New York.  It was fun.  I was very fortunate because I, I made a little money--not a lot, but enough, you know.  But it was, it was not even about that for me.  It was very much, I had these things that happened besides cooking that I just couldn't deal with them properly, my daughter.  I couldn't go, now I couldn't go to my dad's funeral.  I knew that my father dying wasn't just, it wasn't just--it's just not a sentence, it's like reality what happens to our family.  What happens to my two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (Unclear) what happened?
Speaker 2: --what happened to my sisters [Linda Samuelsson and Anna Samuelsson], what happened to my nephew, nieces, and my mom.  Like this is a very big--this is like the biggest deal that happened to us.  And w- I had to grow up very quickly, financially be responsible with things like, you know it's just different.  This is a game changer, and I know it should be but this is not a headline, this is a reality in our family.  It's a very traum- tragic thing, you know.  Our identity, our purpose of going to that summer house where we were from, if he's not around what's our root; and do we belong there even?  Everything that we've been doing for twenty years, twenty-five years--
Speaker 1: You could not go because of work?
Speaker 2: Yeah, no but I--no it wasn't--I didn't have my papers, my papers was in process; and so that's in relation to work, and my--.  So regardless of why, now, it didn't happen and that's--you get separated and my sister has always been there to protect and cover for that.  You just don't feel good about it.  You don't feel good about yourself.  You don't feel good in front of your mother.  This is like, this is it.  Like in our family, it's not gonna get more tragic than that; and it happened, and I was not there, and now it's just an acceptance that Marcus is not, and that's not a good feeling, for a long time.  And then at the same time, I wake up and I have to work and it's just going better than ever and you almost feel shameful for that, too.
Speaker 1: What year did your father die?
Speaker 2: Ninety-six [1996]--
Speaker 1: Ninety-six [1996].
Speaker 2: --in August.
Speaker 1: So, you have, you have the highest heights and the lowest lows.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How are you managing all of that emotion and creating a cuisine?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, emotionally you--I was just never ready for a person, you know, besides me.  I mean, I dated and stuff like that but I knew that was, it couldn't go belong--beyond like nine months or something like that because I don't want anything first of all to get in between me and food; and then I'm not, like we have a lot of stuff at home to take care of.  Like, I can't focus on anything else and so I'm not emotionally in a situation, or ready to accept anybody in that sense.  You know, so it's just a difficult time; but also when I look back on it, a very joyous time because we, I was, our restaurant did very well.  I lived in New York, I did the cuisine that I wanted to do.  I've achieved something in food that never happened before, and I was living the life in one part that I wanted.

Speaker 1: And 'Aquavit' ['Aquavit: And the New Scandinavian Cuisine,' Marcus Samuelsson] you published in what--when was that?
Speaker 2: Two thousand three [2003], but it took four--I mean, my books take four or five years to do.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It takes a long time.
Speaker 1: Prior to that, you became a citizen, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I'm curious about your decision to become a citizen; and what that process was like, given you had a major issue of not being able to get home with your dad [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] passing.  Can you talk about the path to citizenship?
Speaker 2: Well, I became a citizen in 2000, so this was post--but we applied for the papers and it took a long time and then when 9/11 [September 11, 2001] happened you know, everything just stopped, right?  You couldn't put up, probably, it just changed.  It just made it harder.  So we just took li- my citizenship probably took two more years longer, which is nothing compared to what happened, so I'm not complaining about that.  But, it did change a lot of stuff.
Story_ID: 664752
Speaker 1: Now you speak of 9/11 [September 11, 2001], was--you were still, you're still at Aquavit [New York, New York] at that point?
Speaker 2: I mean 9/11, everyone has dealt in New York [New York] with 9/11 in a certain way, and I, I cannot--it was the most devastating thing that happened, not just to the city, to this country in a very long time.  Every New Yorker has a personal, a very--it's a very personal relationship with it.  We lost people.  We lost a part of town.  For me, I worked in the tower [World Trade Center, New York, New York] the weekend before 9/11.  I was filming for Swedish television [Sveriges Television AB].  Mike Lomonaco [Michael Lomonaco] was kind enough to give us the space, so end of August I was working in the tower; and I knew those cooks, I knew those breakfast servers.  I knew a lot of people there; and Michael, Chef Michael was always, just one of the nicest people you would ever meet.   And I shot there, got to meet the staff, cooked there for days; next day, that Tuesday I fly Australia, I'm in Australia when this happens.  You have no idea who, if you knew anyone who died--I knew I knew those cooks, those morning cooks.  You don't know what's gonna happen to your business, you don't know what's gonna happen to your family.  It's like you're a little different, other side of the world, and it forced me to think about--really--it was, it is one of the biggest happenings in my life; and I knew at that point, that was the beginning for me to changing my purpose, after 9/11.  It was, it's very clear to me, being in Australia, flying back on that plane ride--it was the beginning of looking in to my African side, looking in to what can I do for, as a black man, in terms of food in this country besides just looking into trying to be great.  I didn't know how to put it together, but I knew that--I started, you started to ask yourself questions, right?  Are you just going to be busy?  Are you just gonna seat people in Midtown [Midtown Manhattan, New York, New York], or is there a purpose?  And that's really what that did for me.
Speaker 1: When you came back, what was happening at your restaurant?
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, I mean it's almost shameful to talk about it because it's, you know, what we went through as businesses in New York is nothing compared to what the families went through, but the business--there was no business.  It's New York City, as everyone in New York knows, it was a ghost town; and we had to lay off people every day and we don't, we didn't take out salaries for months and that's fine for us because I didn't have, we could do it, but running a business was the scariest time.  It was ghost town and it, I still have a very hard time talking about it because there, you know, there are, there's a lot of people who died and, and that's forever.  We could work it back.  But you didn't know it at the time.  You just didn't.  It was scary, absolutely scary, devastating.
Story_ID: 664753
Speaker 1: I remember that people were s- felt like standing still--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --literally--and not working.  What ultimately happened to the restaurant [Aquavit, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, we had to move, we had to--this is--we got another wonderful three star review [Michelin Guide] eventually, couple of years later.  The book ['Aquavit: And the New Scandinavian Cuisine,' Marcus Samuelsson] got launched and did very, very well; and then we had to move the restaurant and I moved.  You know how you do something, but, you know from 2003 to 2006, my heart was out of it.  We were out of the brownstone, the townhouse; we moved into like a real midtown building and I was never with that.  It was never--my, my heart was not there.  I was working, we did well, but my heart was not there.
Speaker 1: What was your role at the restaurant at that point?
Speaker 2: I was partner, I was second largest owner, and executive chef.  But, I also moved.  I moved to Harlem [New York, New York].  So, my plan of selling my shares and giving up my ownership had started; and it started, actually after 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  But you can't, you know, at that point I had a business.  I can't just do that.  I had responsibilities so it took a couple of years, but I bought a place in Harlem; and those first three years in Harlem from 2002 to 2005 was very important because I biked around, I learned about how this neighborhood looked like and why it looked this way.  I started to understand and it was formative years of creating the restaurant in Harlem that I wanted to create.  I didn't have a name for it, I just knew that the commitment would be here at one point.
Speaker 1: And, when did it go from an idea to, it's gonna happen?
Speaker 2: It took time--I mean, Harriette [HistoryMaker Harriette Cole], it wasn't that fast.  I didn't--you know when, as a black person you, I've always been very sensitive of colonization and master and laborer and money and labor; and I had no right to--I had to go through a Ph.D.  I had to earn and understand the full food industry of Harlem.  So I didn't think I knew that just because I was a big time chef, so I learned that through New York City library [New York Public Library] and through Schomburg [Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, New York, New York], and through speaking to people in the street, regular people, magical people that reminded me of people I met in Africa at that point.  Maybe they didn't have a lot of money but they were regal.  They came out of churches and looking like that, but you had no idea.  You didn't know; you cannot tell who's got what--but they had their stories and they had their memories of what it was.  That's the other thing that links Africa and Harlem.  You always talk about where Harlem is going and what it was.  You always talk about what Africa was and where it's going.  You never talk about now, present, and this is a, a link to various black people, a link.  And I felt like, well I wanted to do something that is in the current, in the present, inspired by the past, but clearly is moving forward--clearly, no doubt.  This is not a time warp.
Story_ID: 664754
Speaker 1: And the decision to be in this location and to name it Red Rooster [Red Rooster Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I was--so I had to first leave Aquavit [New York, New York]--that was like the biggest divorce, you know.  I was, I didn't, you know always been comfortable with money, I worked hard, I always had money--not always, but like f- at that point for the last ten years, at least, and I had, give--I had to buy back my name, first of all.  I had to buy my name back, ownership of my own name, which isn't really my real name so I thought a long time of not doing that.  It was a hard decision; but I did that, so I cleaned up my bank account, bought the rights to my name, which I didn't own it at the time--which is not, which again I became that tragic jazz musician that didn't have all these things structured for you.  So, I did that, I took my stuff uptown, and I knew I wanted to put a restaurant in Harlem [New York, New York]; and I felt at that point--I've lived there for five years--I felt that, I understand Lenox [Lenox Avenue; Malcolm X Boulevard], the difference between Adam Clayton [7th Avenue; Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard] and, you know, Freddie Douglass [8th Avenue; Frederick Douglass Boulevard] meant.  I knew the difference between 125th [Street], and 135th [Street], and 150th [Street]--the history.  I knew that Restaurant Row was just west of Abyssinian [Abyssinian Baptist Church, New York, New York], where Red Rooster was located before--the original Red Rooster.  I knew that Sylvia [Sylvia Woods] had been there for fifty years.  It was Johnson's diner [ph.]; and what Pan Pan [New York, New York] meant to this community; and what Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] meant; the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York].  I knew also people like Billy [Billy Mitchell] at the Apollo that was behind that, working there, you know running sandwiches with Luther Vandross; and, you know, the people that were before Thelma [HistoryMaker Thelma Golden] at the Studio Museum, what they had to do to get that museum in Harlem.  Why would he have that?  You know, so I knew, but often knew the anonymous people, that big--there is the core of the community--they set up sandwich shops after church, volunteered, and went from barbershop to barbershop to sell their sweet potato cakes; and the Jamaicans that did their jerk pork on the corner.  Like I knew, I had license to understand what fried yardbird was about, fried chicken, the core of it--not only fried chicken, beyond fried chicken--that we not all ate that only, all the time.  You know, like license.  So, that take--take time.
Story_ID: 664755
Speaker 1: Marcus [HistoryMaker Marcus Samuelsson], moving from Aquavit [New York, New York] to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --to Red Rooster [Red Rooster Harlem, New York, New York], you mentioned that you had to buy back your name.  Can you describe first: how did you end up being owner--part owner, at Aquavit--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and then the dissolution of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it's, you know, being a chef is many things.  You think it's one thing, right, like most industries, but it's many things.  You're part artist, you're part craftsman; you also have to know law, which you don't as a little kid growing up.  You know, so, but this is the world we live in, so at Aquavit I got my name, I got my name, we did very, very well; and then--where I wan- as I evolved as a man and as a chef, and where the business with my partner wanted to be was two different things.  It happens in creative process, right?  But at the same time, I didn't own my own name, like, you know when I started cooking, Internet wasn't, didn't even exist and dotcom didn't even exist and all this stuff, so I never thought about locking up my own IP [Internet Protocol address]; and I never looked at my own IP different than Aquavit's IP--it was the same, but, for whatever reason I didn't know my name and so I had to first own that and take care of that, and I did that both legally and financially, and that cost me a little bit of money.
Speaker 1: And did you have to own it because it became identical with Aquavit, therefore (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, it wasn't identical with Aquavit, but you know, like we moved slowly to--chefs that become visible, we came from back of the house to front of the house.  We also moved in general to a search economy, which we're in now.  We're in a search economy, right?  So, if you Google something and your name doesn't pop up, and if it does pop up and more than the restaurant pop up and people want to know about it, enter it that way.  You know, you just move.  We've evolved.  So, I needed to own that as an individual.  It's just as a core, you know.
Speaker 1: But, you weren't buying it from someone.  You were just?
Speaker 2: Well, it's a long process, but it cost me a lot of money.  I took care of it.  I started from scratch and I already lived in Harlem [New York, New York] and I had to tell my wife [Maya Haile Samuelsson], like, "Listen, we are now, this is--we're in a new entry.  We're on different ice," which, for me, honestly it never changed my sense of happiness because I still had my craft and had my freedom to start and think the creative process again.  And that was the most important thing for me.  I never had--I mean, if I could do it with--I came to this country with three hundred dollars and an idea.  If I can build that in eight to ten years, I know I can build and another eight, ten years, or fifteen, twenty, thirty years will be completely different; and they are.  I'm on the beginning of that journey and Rooster is a major part of that and being in Harlem is a major part of that--major part of that.  So, I moved to Harlem, I studied Harlem, I talked to the elders and the community leaders that have been here just like your family for a long, long, long time, and felt like now is the time; and my partner and I, Andrew, his father--
Speaker 1: Who's your partner?
Speaker 2: Andrew Chapman.  His father, that is--a true New Yorker.  He said, "If you're gonna do Harlem, do it right: make it big, make it count."
Speaker 1: How did you raise money for this project?
Speaker 2: His family was very--the Chapman family was very helpful to me, very; and his dad and Andrew, because Andrew and I, same age, and we, we had, we could afford to open a smaller restaurant ourselves, but his father was like, "No."  He looked at the map, he's like, "Where's Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York]? Put it close, put it on 125th [Street], put it where it matters, and make it iconic.  I will back you, but don't, you know Harlem needs and deserves something iconic."
Speaker 1: And so, when did you find this--what was here fir- before?
Speaker 2: It was just four walls.  You know, it hadn't been a space for a long--anything for many, many years; but again, at so many times in my life there has been an out- another person--one door shuts, another door opens, and it happens to all of us.  And this was key, so, the fact that people had come and helped me out, I turned key moments in life--obviously because I have worked for it a lot, sometimes luck, sometimes you deserve it, sometimes you're just there, and that's life.  That's the journey of life.  And, as a pr- young professional you have to prepare yourself and have a vision to put yourself in those position--and me and Andrew had that.
Story_ID: 664756
Speaker 1: When did you open Rooster [Red Rooster Harlem, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: December 10, 2010.
Speaker 1: Now, this is a couple of years after the economy has fallen apart again--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and this is an expensive restaurant.  What, what was the opening like in terms of being in this neighborhood?  Harlem [New York, New York] has changed quite a bit, but it's still at a soft time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean for me I have worked--95 percent of my education is being a chef--I've worked to cook for the 2 percent in li- in the city, right?  And, it's so liberating when you can cook for the 98 percent, and that was--'cause I grew up that way.  I grew up in an inclusive environment.  I did not grow up exclusive, and I didn't want to run from myself.  I wanted to do a restaurant that was there to celebrate right after--post church, that was there to celebrate the graduation, but was also there to celebrate every day; and with Rooster we have that possibility.  I want to build a pr- restaurant that it was not fine dining, it's refined dining.  It's not exclusive, it is inclusive.  All of those things are of restaurant, but they are yet different.  We're a brasserie, we're a neighborhood restaurant.  What does that mean?  That means that we can't take all reservation because if the neighborhood--we have three customer: we have the Harlemite, the visitor, and the New Yorker.  The Harlemite, it's their restaurant, they're gonna walk in.  They're not gonna make a reservation to Red Rooster.  They live here.  It's like you hang out in the bar and then you get, you know, twenty minutes later, you have a seat.  The visitor books online.  I'm going to New York [New York].  On that third night, I want to go to Harlem.  I'll go to Brooklyn [New York]; second night, I want to go to Harlem.  They book online most likely.  The New Yorker is like, "Give me eight o'clock seat right now.  Do you know who I am?"  That's a New Yorker, right?  So, we encompass--Rooster encompasses all of that because you can sit in our bar and eat meatballs and have a beer, and can be in and out for twenty bucks [dollars]; or you can come and celebrate and be part of it for $100 a person.  I'm not an editor of your celebration and your happiness anymore.  I'm not gonna tell you how to dress, and--come as you are.  Spend as much or as little as you want, but you're always welcome.  That's a shift.
Story_ID: 664757
Speaker 1: I read about your staffing challenges [at the Red Rooster Harlem, New York, New York] in the beginning, and--
Speaker 2: In the beginning?  They're constant!
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, and, and there was some pushback regarding that.  You know, the, you, you, you brought in a number of, in particular, brown skin people and some of them didn't know how to do the work, and--so can you talk a little bit about the running of the business, and getting staff at the level you need (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, sure, I mean our purpose is to be a neighborhood restaurant, to serve the neighborhood, right?  And that means many things, I mean it means many things in a neighborhood that's 18 percent unemployment--38 percent unemployment among African American men.  We employ 160 people, 75 percent of them live in Harlem [New York, New York].  That's our purpose.  That's a purpose--I can avoid that; I want that.  Now, getting to, to the core staff that are from here when I deliver a high level of service, that takes time.  It's team building.  It takes a long time.  It's not pretty.  It's not easy, but that is the core mission.  So, restaurants, you can't out- outsource.  The staff is here.  The customer comes here.  We build, we're part of building that community, but was it easy?  No.  But it's never been, when you want to apply standards, like my mom's [Samuelsson's adoptive mother, Ann Marie Samuelsson] vanity, or my grandmother's work ethic, or my father's [Samuelsson's adoptive father, Lennart Samuelsson] vision, or my Ethiopian father's [Tsegie] sense of survival, or my Ethiopian mother's [Ahnu] sense of giving it all--none of those were easy experiences.  Painful, hard work, commitment, but seeing it through; and that's wha- that's the work, that's the journ- that's our job now.  You know, there's gonna be voices that are not gonna like all that, and I welcome that because that means you're engaged in what we're doing.  But, that's our commitment, that's our job now, for a long time.
Story_ID: 664758
Speaker 1: So, another question comes.  You know, when you look at your life and how you came into the world, the fusion of your cooking is very reflective of your journey--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and I know that sometimes people criticize that.  Would that--, "That's not Sylvia's [Sylvia Woods] fried chicken."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  No, it's not.
Speaker 1: What is [HistoryMaker] Marcus Samuelsson's cuisine?
Speaker 2: Well, I, it- I know it's delicious.  I've learned to know that it's needed 'cause we do it all over the world at this point, but we do it really terroir, of here.  It's yummy, and you're gonna remember it; and there's no one else to do what we do.  Other people do a lot of good stuff, but no one does what we do.  And, a cuisine is that we're not copy cats.  We're inspired of the past, working with the season, and that opens the door for the future.  But, I'm glad it's not your grandma's fried chicken or our neighbor's fried chicken--it's ours, supposed to be ours.  And that takes some techniques and takes some history and takes some terroir and understanding to do that.  It takes time.  But, we're going to have fun doing it and we're gonna deliver upbeat service in an environment that is gorgeous.  That includes other culture pillars in the community, artists, painters, musicians, and story tellers; and that collectively we will put Harlem [New York, New York] as a destination of food and hospitality.  We started the conversation thr- eight years ago, we've come far, we're not where we need to be yet.  But you know, by adding the food festival [Harlem EatUp!] that we're gonna do this spring together, it's another step; and, again, encompasses a lot of people, a lot of work, and people also will enjoy it.  You know, you--our main purpose, our one main purpose, it is to serve happiness with food.  That's my main purpose.  This is an engagement of hard work but it makes people happy through food.  This is no other words, no other purpose that I'm here for.  That's the purpose.
Speaker 1: I remember getting on an airplane and seeing, sitting in business class--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --happy to be there--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and being handed a menu with your face on it (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you start creating cuisine for airplanes?
Speaker 2: I mean, connecting people is key through, you know when luxury means when you're thirty thousand feet up, could be to get a sandwich that you actually are familiar with, and you know a little bit of the idea behind it.  So, I think--good food is a given today, any part of your life, and we transit people today.  Whether you're on the subway or whether you're on a flight, whether you're in a hotel, bad food is not a proposition anymore.  You can't open and start anything modern today, you can't open an office without having what is my staff or what is my public gonna eat?  So we fall into that as chefs.  I fall into that category as a thinker, as a leader, okay how can we curate this to make it special?  And that c- that conversation will evolve and I think it's important to be ubiquitous right now because I have Harlem on my back, and I want to make sure that we bring Harlem to the world in terms of food.
Story_ID: 664759
Speaker 1: Well as you say that, ubiquitous is the exact word that I would use because you have the airport restaurants, you have Marc Burgers, you have the restaurants in Sweden; so there are a couple of ways I want to look at this.  One, I was saying to Julieanna [Julieanna Richardson], in part you remind me of Ralph Lauren.
Speaker 2: Hm.  I adore Ralph Lauren.  I love what he's contributed.  He's one of the people that I admire so much--selling ties out of his car to where he is today.  I admire that.
Speaker 1: And the brand is crystal clear wherever it is.  And while that is true for you that everything is a different name, and I'm curious as to brand strategy--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and also the financing--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, on such a huge endeavor--global endeavor [Marcus Samuelsson Group].
Speaker 2: Well, I mean today we tell stories through food and we make people happy--that's the goal.  That's the ambition, that's intent.  Now, there are a couple of mechanisms that we need to do that through.  So, media is an important part, so we communicate to over a million people a month through social, through Instagram, Twitter, Google Plus, you name it, right?  Content, recipes.  It's not coming to us to eat--it's just like storytelling.  It's important through TV--'The Feed,' 'The Taste,' 'Chopped.'  Those are important parts of keeping a global dialogue.   So that's then above with traditional media like our newsletter or books.  Nothing is better to tell stories than through books.  So, that part is important.  Media part is important because that is the connective tissue; and then we'll do that with content through traditional restaurant that, in their category should be right there at the top--in their category.  Marc Burger should be a great burger restaurant.  Red Rooster [Red Rooster Harlem, New York, New York] should be a great neighborhood restaurant that sees the neighborhoods through culture and serve great hospitality.  Kitchen and Table in Sweden, a neighborhood restaurant in various cities, value for money, value for money; and it's very important because people work hard and they're tired, so when they come to our restaurant I just want to give them that forty-five minutes or an hour: happiness.  Don't worry about a thing.  We got you for this (gesture)--we can't fix the rest of the day, but we can fix this hour and a half for you.
Story_ID: 664760
Speaker 1: And, you even have what is faster food, because in an airport it needs to be fast.  Then there's Lincoln Center [American Table Cafe and Bar, New York, New York]--I mean, what, can you describe the vision because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --because we went from the, people telling you, "Ce n'est possible" [sic.] to--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yes.
Speaker 1: --"C'est possible."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah but I mean they'll think it's also, you know, people of color, from all colors, especially women, always inspire me.  Like, my hero is Leah Chase [HistoryMaker Leah "Dookie" Chase] from New Orleans [Louisiana], you know.  She owned a restaurant [Dooky Chase's Restaurant, New Orleans, Louisiana] from the '40s [1940s] to now--through Katrina [Hurricane Katrina], through integration and segregation; being a woman, owning her business, I'm sure a lot of people told Leah it's not possible.  If she would listen to any of that, we wouldn't have that, right?  So there's a lot of people that I admire.  Some of them famous, some of them not.  My grandmother is one of them, not, but she is a person I admire.  So, I learned a long time that you di- that other people--you can't listen to other people putting limitations or labels on you.  You have to have a grand vision and you have to dream, dream, really; and then not just be a dreamer, but you actually have to put the connective, do the right thing that connects you to get there, whatever there is, right?
Speaker 1: Getting the money is often--
Speaker 2: It's very hard for us, it's--
Speaker 1: --(unclear) hu- the stumbling block that makes it not happen.  How are you different?
Speaker 2: (Unclear) I mean this is, again, dual.  Restaurants don't get money from the banks--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --period.  We create enormous money yet, we don't get money from the banks.  Now you have a history of black restaurants that don't have the rich uncle to give any money to them, and there's also a time--there were losses up into the '70s [1970s] where African Americans didn't get loans from the bank, period.  So there's are a lot of reasons why we are not in restaurants, we don't have our uncle, because you need to start almost as a family business.  So funding is always an issue, always; and I've been fortunate to have people that supported me, not just coming to the restaurant, but that's a main purpose, but also funded me in other venues; and without this tricky relationship, finance-labor, labor-finance, you don't have anything.  You need labor, you need finance; you need labor, you need finance.  There's--these things will never change.  I've been fortunate enough to have people come to me and support me, and now we're at a point where we can be very selective about it--when we take money in and who we're gonna take it from, because you know, we're, we're a little bit better ourselves today.
Speaker 1: How much of your business do you own?
Speaker 2: The majority of the business, not solely--I don't own all the business outright, but I own the majority of the business, which matters.
Story_ID: 664761
Speaker 1: You have a beautiful wife.
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When, when did you meet and marry Gate; and tell us her name.
Speaker 2: Maya Gate Haile [Maya Haile Samuelsson] is my wife; and she has given me so much things in life that I never thought were possible, most than anything is love and support.  I never viewed myself as being able to marry anybody because I felt always that I had my purpose, sole purpose was only about food.  Maya and her family have really shown me a lot of support and love that I didn't think was possible.  She, I'm always grateful to her because there are a lot of things that she has to sacrifice to, just by being with me, like it's, it's tough.  You know it's like, I work, we work hard, you know, and there are a lot of things she wants to do that you know, we can't really plan because I gotta--I can't be there.  It's very tough, and that's traditional with a chef's wife, but it is also the tradition and ambition of what we do; you know, I have to lead in a certain way 'cause otherwise there will not be opportunities for other people; and that's very hard for any person that just wanna, you know, have a nice husband and get married, you know what I mean?  Where, we have a different responsibility, and she understands that.
Speaker 1: And you married someone from your--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --country.
Speaker 2: Well May- Maya and I were very similar background; in many ways very different and many ways very similar.  Maya left Ethiopia when she was twelve.  She was raised in Holland [the Netherlands] and so she also grew up in Northern Europe.  She speaks many languages; and she knows how to--leave her home early.  She left at eighteen to move to Paris [France] and, and she worked all over the world.  So she understands this thing about having your family all over the world, in Ethiopia, in Holland, in London [England], but yet staying connected.  She does a much better job at it than I do.  She is the one that is on me constantly on this.
Speaker 1: Is she still modeling?
Speaker 2: She models and she has, we have our charity that she works very deep- Three Goats [Three Goats Organization] where she helps young girls in Ethiopia with water, food, and education.  And is something she is deeply committed to; and she goes to the worst part.  She goes to the border, which is the hardest part and--because no one is going to that part of the country.  So, I admire her, her guts and I admire her, her intent of helping the generation, the next generation of young girls and women in Ethiopia.

Speaker 1: What is your vision for the legacy of [HistoryMaker] Marcus Samuelsson?
Speaker 2: Well you know, I have an idea of what I would like to--you know cooking is something that has been part of the black experience for a very, very long time.  We served, we cooked anonymously for a very long time.  Eventually, I want the history to sort of just get back to where it actually was where we still had an owned restaurant or part of our hospitality the way we used to own hospitality, be part of it; and create jobs.  You know and I know that being here in Harlem [New York, New York] on 125th [Street] is a major step and inspiration, aspirations for the next generation; and we're creating leaders in this very restaurant [Red Rooster Harlem, New York, New York].  People will go on and open their own establishments down the street around the country, and they started here, and that's important.  You need to inspire, aspire.  It's very important: aspire, inspire.  So, when it's all said and done, if I can--me and my family can be part of giving that to Harlem and to a generation of American cooks and professionals and the number of people of color are more engaged in it, I will be very, very happy because I know I have been part of that journey.  That's it.  It's going to be something that takes a very long time, but it's possible 'cause I see it, right here.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
