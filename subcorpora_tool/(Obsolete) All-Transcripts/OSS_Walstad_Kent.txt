 Paustenbaugh  Walstad  It is Saturday, October 18th. This is Jennifer Paustenbaugh. I   m at the  ConocoPhillips Alumni Center here on the OSU campus with the O-STATE  Stories Project, part of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. I am here with Kent Walstad who is a former Pistol Pete.  We   re so glad that you made the time to join us today. Thank you very  much.  Thanks for having me.  You are welcome. Can you remember the first time that you saw the  Pistol Pete mascot and what your impression was?  I can remember. I remember as a kid growing up in Oklahoma and my  father bringing me to football games in 1976 and seeing Pistol Pete and  just thinking,    Wow, that   s a guy that   s bigger than life,    and,       that is  really cool.    (Laughs) I was at an age where I wasn   t scared of him  because I was later, part of my elementary years. But yeah, I remember  it and I remember that time thinking,    That   s a pretty cool character.     But did the idea at that time ever enter your mind at all?  Not at all. In fact, it really didn   t even enter my mind to be Pistol Pete  until I was a sophomore in school at Oklahoma State. I had been around  the Oklahoma State football program for a number of years. I had an  uncle that was the defensive line coach for Oklahoma State.  Okay, I wondered what that connection might be.  Yeah back, starting at about 1983, I guess it was, with Jimmy Johnson  and so I was around the football team, was very fortunate in that to be  involved whether it be standing on the sidelines or I guess on that inside  a little bit. But then once I went to school, of course, I began thinking of  5  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  being that. That might be something kind of cool.  So you grew up here in Oklahoma. Were you in Stillwater?  In Blackwell.  In Blackwell, so fairly close by. What was it that led you to decide that  you wanted to go to O-State?  Well, I think, like I said, when I was younger my father used to bring me  to ball games. Once my uncle became a coach here, our family bled  orange. I don   t think there was ever a question of where I was going to  school. There was never a question. It was Oklahoma State all the way.  So besides the Pete experience that you   re going to delve into a little bit  more, what other types of activities were you involved with here?  I was a member of a fraternity here at Oklahoma State. I was a Sigma  Nu. Coming from a small town, that was quite a change for me, quite an  experience to go from a graduating class of about 92 people to having  half that many in your pledge class and living with that many people in  one house. It was a great experience. So I was involved with Sigma Nu  and that. A few activities across campus, whether it be homecoming type  committees or student activities, but just involved.  Do you know how many Sigma Nu   s have been Pistol Pete?  You know we were counting them up today, in fact, we were at the  house and there are six former Pistol Petes that were Sigma Nu.  Including you?  Including me. Starting when we had a run of four straight years, where  we had Pistol Pete   s, Matt Ketchum, myself, Chris Moody, and Brad  Chelf. Brad wasn   t able to make it, I don   t think, this weekend. But there  was a run of four. We took a picture over at the house earlier today.  I interviewed someone this morning, in fact, that made a comment that it  seemed for awhile that that was part of the criteria for being Pete, is that  you had to be a Sigma Nu. So I thought that was interesting and that run  of four straight was pretty amazing.  It was. At the time I don   t think I realized it, but to look back it was a  pretty neat thing.  Sure. So what was the reaction of your friends and family when you  6  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  were selected to be Pistol Pete?  Well it   s really interesting, a buddy of mine, Matt Ketchum   I was best  man in his wedding and he was best man in mine   he was Pete before  me. He and I tried out together, I guess it was our junior year. Matt was  selected and I was not selected. John Price was   John and Matt were  together and so, of course, at that point I knew,    Hey well I have another  chance to do it,    but the following year I, once again, tried out and was  selected for Pete. It was just a great thing. My parents knew. My family  knew that it was something that I was perfect for. They knew that it  would be something that I would really have a good time with. I  remember calling my mom. She was traveling on the road and I  remember telling the lady at the hotel. She asked who I was, called to  page my mom, and asked who was calling and I said,    Tell her Pistol  Pete   s calling.    So that was a fun thing for my mom and I.  I bet. So what was the try-out like?  Oh the try-out was great. I mean, fortunately the second year I knew a  little bit of what to expect. We went through an interview process, a  panel of several Pistol Petes were involved, asking you questions about  your involvement in school. Just a typical interview. Of course they  asked you to put your head on. Put you through situational type things.  Situations like,    Okay, let   s say you   re at Oklahoma, you   re in Norman  at a game, and someone shoots you the bird. What   s your reaction going  to be?    (Laughs) Of course, you know what you want to do, but  representing Oklahoma State what can you do? It was a very relaxed  interview. Probably very stressful that first year, but second year was  pretty relaxed for me.  So what is the answer to that question? (Laughter)  The answer to that might be at least point your gun at them or  something. (Laughter) No, it would be to move on, I guess.  I talked to Rob Reynolds yesterday. He was the Pete in    84. I know at  that time they had a Pete and an alternate. Do you know what point the  two Pete concepts sort of got started?  It had to be   I know that in    88,    89 when I tried out that first time,  there were two Petes at that time. It   s got to be somewhere shortly after  Rob and them, that they went to the two-Pete system, where there were  two Petes dividing up all of the different activities.  And not one that was considered the primary and     7  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  No.  I didn   t even realize that they had that model before they went to the  selecting two people to do it.  Yeah.  So how did you prepare for the try-out process? At least the first time, I  mean obviously the second time you knew what was going to happen.  Well, the first time they   once, I guess, they posted in the O   Colly that,     Hey the Spirit Club try-outs and the Pistol Pete try-outs    and the Pistol  Petes came   we went over to the Colvin Center at the time and had a  room that was open for a couple of hours for several times over a two  week period or so where you could go over, you could get hints from  them, you could ask them about situations, you had an opportunity to put  the head on, had an opportunity to walk, to teach you how to walk, to  how to spin the gun, all of the different things that would probably be  involved in the interview process where you   re putting the head on.  What was it like the first time you put the head on?  Well, the first time you put it on, I was kind of   overwhelmed, I don   t  think is the right word. But    Wow, this is really heavy.    You realize  that, you see all of these mascots that are very mobile, very   last night  at the basketball thing, the Denver Nuggets mascot comes flying in on a  rope. Pistol Pete can never do that. (Laughs) The head is such that it   s  simply resting in on the back of your head. If you lean backwards, it   s  going backwards; it   s not a mobile type mascot where you are going to  be able to do cart wheels and things like that. You would find yourself in  situations that at opposing people   s arenas they thought you were that  type of mobile person and they might come over and begin to play with  you, try to get you to wrestle with them (laughter) or something. You  just gotta shoot   em. You   re not gonna wrestle them.  Right, so I   m assuming at least in the Big XII now there   s a good  understanding of     I think there is a good understanding of that.  So are there any Dos and Don   ts that you have as Pete?  The dos and the don   ts   if you   re familiar with Lewis, or now it   s  Boone Pickens Stadium   Lewis Field when I was there. Very tight on  the sidelines, very difficult to go say from end zone to in end zone  without traveling right through the middle of opposing teams or through  8  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Oklahoma State   s. Since it   s so tight along those sidelines, I remember  traveling between   when Nebraska was in town, for example, Tom  Osborne was coaching, and traveling back through there and getting an  ear full from a few of their coaches about getting out of there, so that  was probably one thing I shouldn   t have done, but I figured,    Hey  they   re at our place, I can do this.    You know, what was kind of fun as  Pistol Pete, once you put the head on, the uniform, it   s like knowing  where you   re going, you can get in anywhere.  (Laughs) It   s your    Get Out of Jail Free    card?  Your    Get Out of Jail Free    card, but as far as dos and don   ts you want  to keep it positive. Obviously, the fans get into the ballgame. Me being a  fan now, I can get into the game. You   ve got to be careful to draw a line  that you don   t cross over and begin to stir the pot, I guess you might say,  as opposed   if the official makes a bad call obviously you can   t show  that official up (Laughs) or get insight a riot or something like that in the  arena. They   ll do that on their own.  So are there any explicit behavior expectations that are communicated  to Petes throughout the time you tried out?  Maybe clarify that more.  Oh, I don   t know, was there any talk that you   re one of the most  important and public representatives?  Oh absolutely, a lot of that during the interview process. Obviously  visiting with the interviewees regarding your character. You are  representing Oklahoma State if you get involved in something. You  know, here are things you cannot do. I remember there was a local  politician in town that was running for office, obviously right during  football season, that   s always a hot time of the year, right now. I  remember a local person actually took a picture with Pistol Pete and then  published it in the newspaper that    Pistol Pete is for Bernice Shedrick,     (Laughs) at the time is who it was. I remember them posting that and her  putting that in the paper or part of her committee or whatever and that  was just a big no-no, obviously.  Right. So do you know what happened?  I don   t know exactly what happened, it was Price or Ketchum that was  involved in that, the year before me.  Interesting. So how many athletic events and activities did you  participate annually?  9  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  That one year that I did it, I can   t remember the exact number. But the  number of events that I participated in was well over 300 events that one  year. A typical game day might consist of being at the business building,  being at the home-ec, one of   tremendous amount of events, obviously.  But I was at over 300 different events; athletic events were really the  smaller amount of things that you were involved in.  Right. So did you go to a lot of women   s athletic events?  Went to a lot of the women   s   in fact that year, the year I was Pete, the  women played in the NCAA basketball tournament back then and hosted  the University of Michigan at Gallagher-Iba, so I was able to go to that  event. Tried to make it to as many women   s events as possible. A few  softball games we were able to go to.  Well yeah, I   ve noticed over the years that Pete   s turned up at more and  more women   s athletic events and     I think that   s very important that they recognize that and do that.  Yeah, well especially for the young girls that come out there and they  just think (Laughs) that it   s always. I think that   s great. Were you ever  paid for personal appearances?  We did. We received it as scholarship, of course. There were situations  where we were invited   like I went down to the Azalea Festival or  something of that nature. Back then we didn   t charge a fee. It was more  of an in-kind donation that a group would make and often it was an alum  that wanted Pistol Pete at their event, whether it be walking in a parade  at Oklahoma City or coming down to the Azalea Festival. There would  be   they would make a donation or whatever to the Petes for that.  So how was it decided, which of these things that were off campus, that  somebody was going to do it; you flipped a coin?  Dave Martin was kind of the person that we reported to and before the  first football season we   d sit down and divide them up and we said,     Okay home games we   ll spit up, I   ll do a half, you do a half. But on the  road let   s split these games up, where do you want to go? Where do I  want to go?    We really looked at the basketball schedule, the football  schedule, what are the really fun type events, where you can travel to  some destination like if you   re going to go to Las Vegas or something  like that, obviously, both of us might want to go do that. But how could  we make it really even to where we both got to go to fun things if you   re  only taking one? We just worked it out among ourselves.  10  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  You mentioned the fact that you reported to Dave Martin and I guess his  capacity is being over the Spirit Squad in some sense. Some people  commented on how important the relationship and his wife Toni was.  Just incredible, even to this day. Still get the Christmas card from Dave,  still send him a Christmas card. Dave has gone out of his way,    I   m  gonna take these students that serve the university under my wing and  I   m gonna learn about them. I am gonna learn about their families. I   m  gonna show interest in them.    He   s just done a great job of   you know  they host a Christmas party at their house, or they used to anyway     don   t know whether they do that still. Just a friend of Pistol Pete   s, that   s  about the only thing I could say, still to this day, if there   s ever anything  I need, it seems like I could give him a call and he   ll help me out.  So you tried out the first time and you were not successful. So getting it  on the second try-out, I mean your expectations of what this was going  to be like must have been so huge. Did that year meet your expectations?  It more than met my expectations, and I   Matt Ketchum and I happened  to be roommates the year he was Pete, so I was very much involved in  seeing what he was doing, often traveling with him to ballgames or  whatever, to the different events or seeing everything he was involved  in. Then once I became Pete it was more than I could have ever  expected.  Did it differ in any way?  No, it was pretty much the same other than the football team when he  was there had Barry Sanders and was doing wonderful things and the  following year was the beginning of the probation when I was Pete, but  Mike was still the quarterback and we won six ballgames, but then it  was downhill after that for a few years. (Laughs)  Yeah, it sure was. So what was a typical week like for you as Pete and  trying to work in your schedule as a student too?  You know during football season it really wasn   t too bad. I mean  football was often on Saturdays, so maybe there was a Thursday night  game or something. During the week, during football season, it wasn   t     when you get into the winter months when you   ve got men   s basketball,  women   s basketball, and wrestling going on, that   s when it is really  becomes pretty hectic at that point, during that time frame from about  December until   everything just kind of rolls all the way into baseball.  But a typical week would be maybe a few events during the week,  maybe on a Thursday night or something, but then Saturdays, of course  were   you knew those Saturdays were going to be very busy clear up  11  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  until kick-off and even after kick-off with parties or other things that are  going on.  So what was your favorite athletic event to be Pete?  I feel very fortunate. I got to go to a couple of different places that are  what I would consider, having been to a number of different venues, I  had the opportunity to represent Oklahoma State at Ohio State in the     Horseshoe     Ohio Stadium  as Pistol Pete. We didn   t fair too well up  there (Laughs), but there   s been a lot of folks that leave there that leave  disappointed. So I was fortunate enough to be able to do that. I was  fortunate enough to travel to Las Vegas to see that UNLV basketball  team that won the National Championship with Jerry Tarkanian, their  coach. I got to go out there and Leonard Hamilton was our coach at that  time. So those were a couple of events that I got to be involved with.  Probably the one though   the Special Olympics, used to be hosted, I   m  unsure if it still is, used to be hosted here in Stillwater. Being able to be  Pistol Pete at that and watching these young kids, the opening  ceremonies, watching these athletes with special needs was really  special. Troy Aikman happened to be at the event that day. He had just  graduated, or left UCLA, and was on his way to become a Dallas  Cowboy, so I remember getting a picture taken with him and autograph  and note signed, it   s over in Heritage Hall, in fact. But those are a couple  of things that were really special.  Was it difficult to learn how to be Pete, like something people  commented on learning how to be an effective Pete in wrestling was a  challenge for them. Were there different challenges, different types of  sports?  You know, I don   t know that they were necessarily challenging as much  as figuring out how to maneuver around. When you   re at a football  game, it   s pretty safe, you   re on the field for the most part, or you   re not  for the most part, and you   re not into the stands. In basketball you   re on  the floor, but you   re also kind of   it   s just tighter quarters so you   re  having to watch out for little kids that are always right under your feet  and you don   t see them until you   re stepping on their foot or something.  Wrestling, I think was pretty easy to stand out of the way, just want to  make sure that you   re out of the way and that you   re not obstructing  anyone   s views.  Since Pistol Pete is unusual in that fact that he was actually based off of  a real person, were there any things that you learned about Frank Eaton  and his characteristics that you tried to incorporate into your portrayal  of Pete?  12  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  I think as much as anything when you look at Frank Eaton and what  happened to him as a child and what he took upon himself to go out and  to revenge this awful death of his father, you think of the persistency and  you think of the   you want to call it work ethic (Laughs) or whatever  you want call it that,    Hey I   m gonna take this on and I   m gonna do the  best job that I can do. I   m gonna do my best to get the crowd into it. I   m  gonna do my best to take time to be with the kids.    Because that   s as  much as anything, is taking the time to represent the university. I think  that   s what the alumni would want. They would want to know that Pete  is representing the university, but he is also taking the time to be with  the kids because we all know   we   ve all seen the pictures with Pete and  kids.  Yeah, that   s special.  It is special.  So, are there ways that you think, besides the fact that Pete   s based on a  real person, are there ways that you think that the Pete mascot is really  different than other university mascots?  I think that comes back to what I was saying just a second ago about  being mobile. I mean this is a real character, you know. I look at what  happens south of us at Oklahoma. Who is their mascot really? I mean I  think that of that   is it a dog during basketball season? I don   t know  what it is. I think being a real person   it   s really interesting. People at  places where we would travel, I would often get stopped and people  would wonder, they would see me carrying the head out of the arena and  would stop and say,    Thanks for coming,    or whatever and they would  want to know a little bit about Pistol Pete. I think people can tell there   s  something there other than just a dog running around or a furry  character. There   s something behind that guy right there and I remember  having conversations with people where they wanted to know all about  Pistol Pete. It was really good to visit with people about that.  Did you ever participate in any kind of a mascot competition?  The only competition that I was involved in would have been like a  cheerleading camp. You know, I was very fortunate to get to go to  cheerleading camp (Laughs). All of my buddies wanted to join me. That  was a great thing. That was the only competition I was involved in. I  think at the national pom and cheer, they had the competitions. I know  Matt was involved in the skiing contest at Crested Butte, where we  actually skied with the head on.  Someone said that they knew that there had been a Pete that had skied  13  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  with the head.  Yeah, Matt Ketchum was the one that skied with the Pistol Pete head on.  He   s a very good skier. It   s not something I would have felt confident  doing. That would have been a quick trip to the hospital for me.  What was your most embarrassing moment as Pete? You talked about  some of the highlights.  My most embarrassing moment    Probably whether it   s embarrassing  or    what I learned was I didn   t get embarrassed with the head on  because you   re hiding behind the head. But probably the most  memorable thing that I remember was we were at the University of  Kansas and the protocol was that Pistol Pete  head  traveled with the  football equipment or with the band. Because it traveled in a big crate,  and being very large   and we traveled in those large passenger vans to  out of town games. So Friday evenings I had to get the head cratered up  and get it over to the band so it would travel with them to the game, and  then I would go pick it up before the game and wear it.  Well, we were in Lawrence, Kansas for the football game and I had to  leave the game after the game was over, take it over so we could crate it  up, and the cheerleaders left me in Lawrence, Kansas. Okay, I came  back to where they were and they were all gone. This was before cell  phones, where you can get on the phone and call someone and say,     Come back and get me.    That didn   t happen. They left me in Lawrence,  Kansas and if you   ve ever been to Lawrence, Kansas, there are turnpikes  up there, so I thought to myself,    Okay, what I need to do is get to the  turnpike, get to the booth, because maybe they stopped and ate. I   ll just  wait right there and they   ll come through this entry point and I   ll get in  with them at that point.    So I hoofed a ride out to the turnpike, but I  don   t even know who with, it was a stranger that took me out. I told  them my situation.  As I was standing out there, several of my class mates from one of my  classes just happened to pull through. They were yelling at me    What  are you doing? What are you doing?    I said,    The cheerleaders left me  out here and I don   t have a ride back to Stillwater     so I jumped in the  car and left with them. Well, of course, when you get back to town, it  was always late at night, about 11 o   clock, about the time to go out  anyway (Laughs), so I remember going to Eskimo Joe   s afterwards.  Come to find out, about two hours later, some of the cheerleaders show  and said,    Where were you? What happened?    and I said    You guys left  me there     They had gotten about 40 miles down the road and turned  around and went back to Lawrence to get me before they realized  someone had left me there. So then they were late, but then again that  14  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  was before cell phones. So I guess that   s     Someone had said that they thought there had been some kind of  tradition of leaving Pete at an event. Maybe if there is a tradition, you  started it.  Maybe, they didn   t let me in on that and I just became victim to that. It  was funny, it was something I will always remember. You know at the  time, I think I was probably upset. But looking back on it, it   s probably  one of the greatest memories I   ve got.  (Laughs) That   s a good story. Now I   m making an assumption here that  you have kids?  I have three children.  So what is their reaction?  We live in Michigan. To them, Daddy   s Pistol Pete really didn   t mean a  whole lot. I mean, we watch ballgames, obviously, all that we can. And  we   ve got the Pistol Pete books and I read those to them. Kirsten, my  wife, tells them,    Daddy was Pistol Pete,    but it didn   t really connect  with them. This homecoming is the first time we   ve been back as a  family. They   ve been back with me when they were really young, but  they don   t remember. But for them, I think this weekend has really made  them understand that,    Wow, this is more than just a character.    So it   s  been a good experience. It   s something I think they are very proud of. I  know a dad up in Michigan was telling me that,    Hey Connor was  telling us that you were Pistol Pete    and he, of course said,    Were you  the basketball player?    (Laughter) Then I said,    I wish I was.     (Laughs) So what did being Pete mean to you at the time?  At the time it was, I know that we were part of the Spirit Group. I wasn   t  necessarily part of the Spirit Group, I didn   t feel like. I mean, I looked at  it as,    Okay, I   m gonna represent the university.    I looked at it as an  honor, that I   ve been entrusted with,    Wow representing this great  university    of all these alums and everywhere we go, eyes are on you  and so you   ve got to make sure that you   re doing things right. But it was  just a special feeling, having family, one cousin that played football here  and the uncle that was coaching here. It truly was an honor and my way  of being part of the OSU family, really.  So now that you have had, I guess going on 20 years almost, sort of in  retrospect what does it mean to you now to have done that?  15  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Well, I tell you, when people find out that I was Pistol Pete, they want to  talk about it. They want to know about the head. They want to know  about the events.    Was it hot? Did you get tired?    Did you do all of  those things? It   s been more than I can have ever imagined. I don   t think  when I signed up to do this that I realized the impact that it would still  have on me all these years later. It   s been an incredible thing, whether it  be from business contacts; to when people find out that you   ve been  Pistol Pete, they want to know about it. You have a story to tell, I guess  is what you could say. In fact, living in Michigan I was at an  appointment the other day. I was visiting with a lady and she asked me  where I went to school. She could tell I wasn   t from Michigan. I said,    I  went to school at Oklahoma State,    and she said    Really?    So visiting  with her, come to find out she and her husband, they had both gone to  school up in Michigan, but her husband had done his graduate work with  the safety prevention program here, he had gotten his master   s degree  here and they had lived in married student housing. She said,    Oh, we  just love OSU, my husband still follows them, in fact, that mascot of  theirs, Pistol Pete, my kids, I   ve got a picture of my kids when they were  two years old, on his lap.    I said,    Pistol Pete? I was Pistol Pete     and  she couldn   t believe it. I mean it   s far spreading. This was just last week.  Wow, what a kick.  Yeah, it is quite a kick.  So are there special bonds between the former Petes? You talked about  your relationship with Matt Ketchum went sort of beyond that immediate  other side of you.  Yeah, I think it   s a situation   it   s always good to see those guys. You  know you   re always welcome back. You feel like you   re part of a  special group. Like today at the homecoming program, I mean it   s often  been known as the    Rowdy float.    They took the guns away from us this  year and said we can   t do that anymore. But it was like the Wild West  on that float for all the years that I had been back for it. Now, they   ve  tempered that a little bit, I mean, you understand why, things change, a  lot things change. But yeah, there   s a special bond. There   s that as Dave  Martin said yesterday,    There   s 53 out here and all of you think you  were the best Pistol Pete.    (Laughter)  That sounds like something Dave would say. So do you think that there   s  any type of collective legacy that the former Petes offer the university?  I do. I think that you find a group of guys that just bleed this university,  that are unbelievable ambassadors for the university that would do  anything to this day for this school that was asked of them. I mean, I just  16  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  think that   knowing that it   s not a fuzzy dog that does somersaults, it   s  representing a true character, a true person that stretches beyond just  what that person did. The Charlie Lester family was at our event last  night, him being the very first Pistol Pete. To see his wife there and his  kids there and his grandkids there, and t-shirts they had made up, it   s a  big deal to them; it   s a big deal to all of us. Probably not when we signed  up for it but it is now. It   s so great to see the university has done so  much to carry on Pistol Pete. Some things sometimes get shelved and  put aside, but Pistol Pete being so recognizable is always there.  Yeah, he   s an institution all by himself.  He really is.  So what would you tell somebody that wanted to try out for the role of  Pistol Pete?  I would encourage them, first of all, to do it, because throughout life,  you look for things, that,    Okay, how can I better myself and how can I  put a leg up on anything    and definitely by being a Pistol Pete, by  representing the university, by the people you will meet, the  responsibilities that you have to the university, it will be far more than  the effort you spend that year and the time that you put into it. Yeah, it   s  a lot of work during the time that you   re doing it, but it was time well  spent. It was unbelievable.  Well one of the final questions I want to ask seems so obvious. Reflecting  back, would you do it again?  Absolutely, absolutely. You know, I was thinking to myself last night,  while I was in there in this packed house of 13,000 in Gallagher-Iba.  You think,    Wow, I wonder what it would be like to put the head on  now.    I   m 41 years old. Do I have the energy? Could I get into character  again? And absolutely, I would do it again. There   s just something about  when the head goes on, the character comes out and it has been, of the  accomplishments that I have had, by far this is the thing that is one of  the greatest things I   ve ever done and I   m so thankful to the university  that I was selected. I look at it as an honor. I don   t take it lightly. I think  it was a wonderful thing.  Is there anything that you wish I would have asked you about your  experience as Pete that I didn   t?  I   ll tell a story about my wife now, Kirsten, and a situation. We were  playing at the University of Oklahoma, and of course, Pete got to the  game about an hour and a half before kick-off and my wife, I dated her  17  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  Paustenbaugh  Walstad  while we were here at school at Oklahoma State. There were times  where she had to take a backseat to Pete, because I obviously had the  responsibilities, activities that I had to be at and she had to be put on the  shelf, I guess, for the time being while I took care of things. But she had  to take a back seat, literally a back seat in this situation. I drove a 1977  Cutlass and the only thing that that Pistol Pete head would fit in was the  front seat. So the only way I could cart that thing around was for it to be  in the front seat.  Well, we were at the University of Oklahoma; we had gone down the  night before and stayed at her sister   s place. Her sister went to school at  Oklahoma. She was going to go to the game with me the next day. So  I   ve got the Pistol Pete head and we   re driving by Owen Field before the  game. Low and behold I   m driving down the street and there   s Dave  Martin, so I thought    What the heck    not thinking Kirsten   s in the  backseat, taking a backseat to Pistol Pete. So I saw Dave in there and  she   ll never forget that, saying,    I just wanted to crawl under the seat. I  just hated that I had to sit in the backseat and the Pistol Pete head is in  the front seat.    (Laughter) But today she gives me a hard time about it,  but I think she is proud of that as well and looks back on it as a great  time, something for our family to carry on with our family.  And all of the great stories     And all the great stories, the stories are unbelievable. It   s fun.  Well thank you so much for doing this.  Oh, thank you   I hope you have a great time at the game today.  Oh we will. How can you not?  Will you be down at the first TV?  Yeah, I think we have to meet there in about fifteen minutes.  Okay.  Thank you so much I appreciate it.  -------  -------
