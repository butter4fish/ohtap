 Little Thunder  My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Saturday, November  17, 2012, and I   m interviewing Cherokee bead artist Martha Berry for  the Oklahoma Native Artists Project, sponsored by the Oklahoma  Oral   History Research Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at  Martha   s home in Tyler, Texas, out in the country. Martha, you were a  relative late-comer to beadwork, but you quickly went on to win major  awards with your bandolier bags and other cultural items. You   ve also  taught beadwork, and your work has been reproduced in Art of the  Cherokee  Prehistory to the Present , among other places. Thank you for  taking the time to talk with me.  Oh, I   m delighted. I   m absolutely delighted.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. At the time, we actually lived in  Mounds, which is a tiny little place south of there, and lived there until  the summer I turned eight when we moved to Tulsa. My father was with  the National Bank of Tulsa, which later became Bank of Oklahoma. He  got high enough in the bank that he couldn   t commute and take care of  cattle and do his job within the community, so we moved to Tulsa for  him.  I finished growing up there, graduated Edison High School, class of  1966. I lived there, I met my husband there, married him, and actually  gave birth to our oldest child there before we moved. I married an editor,  newspaper editor, and we   ve moved a lot since then. (Laughter) We   ve  lived a lot of different places, but that   s just the way it goes.  So you explained what your dad did for a living. Was your mom a  homemaker, or did she work also?  5  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  No, she was a homemaker. She was the consummate volunteer, though,  and she was an executive   s wife. To just briefly tell you my upbringing,  to tell you my dad   s story, they were very poor after the land allotment  and couldn   t make a living on the farm. There wasn   t enough land, so he  came to Tulsa and got a job working nights at what was then the  Exchange Bank of Tulsa and going to University of Tulsa all day. Forty-four  years later, the bank had become the Bank of Oklahoma, and my  dad had gone from working nights to being a senior vice-president.  Wow, he really worked his way up.  My life was a banker   s daughter, and my mother   s life was a banker   s  wife. She was always very active in our lives and very active in   she  was president of the PTA at every school I ever attended, Girl Scout  leader, choir leader, all that kind of thing. She didn   t work outside the  home, but, boy, she worked. She worked.  Yes. How about your grandparents on either side?  The only grandparent I ever knew was my mother   s mother. They were  all passed before. Actually, her husband was alive, but he died when I  was six months old. She   s the only one I ever knew, and she lived next  door to us when I was a little girl when we lived in Mounds. She   s the  one that taught me to embroider, to do handwork. She loved to do  handwork, needle-and-thread handwork. I wasn   t even five years old,  and she gave me a darning needle with yarn and sat me in her lap with  her arms around me and taught me how to embroider.  I never knew either of my dad   s parents. One of the reasons I got into   beading  (really, I mean the reason) was because all my female  Cherokee ancestors had died before I was born and I didn   t know what  Cherokee women were like. I wanted to know things like what their  hands looked like, and what tickled them, and what made them blush  and made them laugh, what made them angry, and all those little things  that you can   t know of the dead.  Because I had this inner fight of    am I non-Indian, or am I Indian?    all  my life, not knowing those women really bothered me because I didn   t  know what it was like. So I thought,    Well, you know what? I had this  great bonding experience with my non-Indian grandmother, using a  needle and thread. Is it possible that I could do the same work that my  Cherokee grandmothers did and make all those little hundreds of  decisions along the way when you make a piece, a garment, anything,  and maybe find that bond that I just craved so much?     6  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  I   m probably getting ahead of your questions. What I did was I went to  the hobby shop, to Hobby Lobby, and got a stack of how-to books and  all these materials and went home to do Native American beadwork,  thinking I was doing what my Cherokee grandmothers had done. I,  fortunately, continued to do research into Cherokee history and into my  family   s history, in particular, and I would run across a photograph of an  artifact, a beaded artifact.  It would be, generally, a bandolier bag or a sash, sometimes moccasins,  or I   d run across a portrait of a Southeastern tribal chief or a powerful  person, and they would be wearing beadwork. None of it was like any of  the stuff I was doing from the how-to books, and I began to realize that  there was a big difference between the beadwork of my ancestors and  the Plains beadwork. I have a great respect for Plains beadwork, but it  isn   t mine.  I wanted to what my grandmothers had done. That was the whole point  was doing what my grandmothers had done. I started trying to find  information, and there was just nothing there, so I started collecting  photographs. That was the only thing I could do was collect  photographs. I finally got the courage to write letters to the big museums  back East, the Smithsonian, the Peabody, to ask them for photographs of  Cherokee beaded artifacts and photographs or images of Cherokees  wearing beadwork.  I got a good response. All of the photographs that came back were of  artifacts prior to the Removal, and they   re all in the Southeastern style.  All of the photographs of Cherokees wearing beadwork were post-1922,  and they   re all wearing Plains beadwork. I thought there was a mystery  of what happened because it   s a beautiful art form. I just couldn   t  understand what had happened. In the Smithsonian envelope was an  application for a grant, which allowed me to spend three weeks in  Washington examining their artifacts, and it took off from there.  And that was what year?  Well, it was 2000 because it was the year before 2001.  Wow. Okay, great. Those are great research stories, and we   ll explore  them in a little more depth here. You sort of implied what was going on  in terms of growing up around the culture and the language, but maybe  you can talk a little more about what was there or not there for you just  growing up.  Absolutely. It was important, I think, because I don   t think I   d be here if  I had   I   m not sure if I had been raised steeped in Cherokee stuff and  7  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  going to stomp dances and all that, Cherokee art and that kind of thing,  I don   t think it would   ve had the meaning to me. It wouldn   t have been  as precious as it is now. Every morsel of knowledge was a feast for me,  and I just couldn   t get enough.  My mom, God love her, she was   you can tell I live in the South   bless  her heart. (Laughter) I was born in 1948, grew up in the    50s and    60s. It  was a very conservative time in this country. It was during the  Senator  Joseph  McCarthy era. You didn   t want to be different. When we moved  to Tulsa we were in the suburbs, and, of course, Dad was climbing up in  the bank. There were a whole lot of people like my dad, who had moved  from the Cherokee Nation or whatever Nation into Tulsa who could  pass, and who did, and, you know, you didn   t talk about your past.  I knew that there was something about me that my dad was very proud  of, over which I had no control. I knew that there was something about  the same thing about me that my mother was ashamed of and wanted to  try to hide and made it very clear. I remember one incident in the second  grade when the state of Oklahoma was paying for any Native American  (don   t get me started on blood quantum) one-quarter or more. The State  of Oklahoma would pay the school to educate the child.  They gave us little forms to fill out. If you were Indian, you would take  it home. I raised my hand because I knew I was Cherokee. I didn   t know  I wasn   t supposed to do that at that point, second grade. I took this form  home, and my mother hit the roof and made it very clear that I was never  ever to bring that up, never to talk about it, never to tell anybody, and if  it did come up for some reason, I was specifically told things I should  say and ways I should say them to do the least damage, in her mind.  To this day, a vivid image of childhood was standing in our hallway  looking at that hardwood floor with my little Mary Janes and my little  lacey socks because I couldn   t bear to look at her. She was just trying to  protect me, but it bred in me this huge curiosity about,    How could it be  that my dad is so proud of this and my mom is so ashamed?     Right. That   s not a fun dynamic to deal with.  Well, and I think a lot of young people nowadays don   t understand what  it was like.  Yes, they don   t. So what is your first memory of seeing Native art or art  that you would identify     Oh, Willard Stone. My mom   s best friend from age four on, her husband  was Willard Stone   s boss at Spartan Aeronautics or whatever it was  8  Little Thunder  Berry  where he worked. At Gilcrease back in the    60s (I was, like, maybe  junior-high age, I think) he had an exhibit. It was relatively small. It was  in a small room, but it was his beautiful work. For those who don   t know  who Willard Stone is, he was a Cherokee man who carved wood. The  lines of his sculptures are   I don   t know what he studied or if it came  from his ancestors, but you can see in nineteenth-century beadwork the  same lines that he sculpted. His work is absolutely breathtaking.  Because Mama knew Aunt Hattie, we were invited to this opening. I had  never been to a gallery opening in my life, or a museum opening. They  took me, and we went. Gilcrease had always been a favorite place for  me. We looked at everything all over the building, but once I hit that  room, I couldn   t leave. I couldn   t get enough. Mom and Dad would  come and check on me and then go see something else and come back.  Until they shut the place down that night, I couldn   t leave that room. I  just couldn   t get enough. It was like eye candy. That is my first  experience of art that was Cherokee that was different, that didn   t look  like what you normally, you know, all that stuff that we associate with  Indian art.  How about your first memory of making art, any kind of art?  Of course, embroidery with Grandma, although she drew the little  design, drew the little flowers and whatnot. Probably my first experience  with beads was as a little girl. We made little Christmas ornaments. We  had little round styrofoam balls that had a little pipe cleaner sticking out,  and Mama bought sequins and beads, mostly reds and greens for  Christmas, and these special little pins. They were only about that long.  (Gestures) You could take the pin, put a bead down, put a sequin down,  and stick it in the styrofoam and cover these Styrofoam balls with this  glittery   I do love me some bling, and it was sparkly  (Laughter) I was  probably eight, nine, ten   well, probably about eight, third grade,  something like that. I loved them  I don   t know what it is about beads.  They sound neat. They   re heavy. They feel neat. That was my first  experience with beads.  Then also when I got a little older, I had a white felt poodle skirt, which  anybody who knows anything about the    50s and    60s, poodle skirt,  which is a plain, white skirt. For various holidays we would take the  poodle off, (it was just basted on) and we had hearts with sequins and  beads for Valentine   s Day. I forgot what we had for Christmas, and we  had shamrocks for St. Patrick   s Day. So on that day of whatever (and I  think we had stuff for Halloween) I would wear that to school. A lot of  the girls did that in those days. We   d take the old ones off and baste the  other ones on. I helped Mama make the little sequined beaded hearts or  shamrocks or whatever. I was drawn to those beads. I don   t know what it  9  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  is.  My daughter, my older one, works with beads sometimes. When she was  in junior high, she started that. I think she would purposely spill the  beads so she would have to sort them. Honest to God, I think she did. I  don   t know what it is. There   s something about the beads that sucks you  in. (Laughter)  I remember one time, one of the stories, when I was making little  ornaments with sequins and beads, it   s like, probably, hundreds of  sequins and hundreds of beads on a particular ornament. You get in a  routine where you pick up the pin, you pick up the bead. You had to lick  your finger and then touch the sequin to pick them up because you can   t  pick up a sequin easily. I   m doing this hundreds of times, over and over  and over again. I got watching TV, and I got in the wrong order. I licked  my finger, I picked up a sequin, and I put it back in my mouth, and then  I swallowed this sequin. I said,    Oh, Mama, Mama, I swallowed a  sequin     She said,    Oh, go eat a piece of bread. You   ll be fine.     (Laughter) And I was.  Do any other art experiences stand out for you in middle school or high  school?  The only two teachers who have ever hated me in school and that I did  not get along with were my art teacher in elementary school, Mrs. Culp,  and my home economics sewing teacher in junior high, Mrs. Whittaker.  I don   t know why Mrs.   well, I do know why Mrs. Culp hated me:  because I would not paint things in order. I don   t know. She and I just  clashed. Anyway, Mrs. Culp didn   t like me, and I didn   t do too well in  that class. That was in elementary school. Then in junior high, my home  ec teacher, which would be the sewing teacher, she didn   t like me  because I had been sewing, sewing machine and everything, before I  ever took my seventh-grade required home economics class.  Was it your mom that had     Yes, my mom. My grandmother was the handwork person, but my  mama could use the sewing machine. She was an artist. She also  could   I could point out a photograph of a dress in a fashion magazine,  and my mama would make it for me. She made every stitch I wore until  I was about eighteen and had taught me. I had started sewing early on  with a sewing machine.  So I go to seventh grade, and Mrs. Whittaker said,    Well, this is how  you do the hem. This is how       You know? I thought,    Well, this is not  how I do a hem. I   m not doing this. Too much trouble,    and so she gave  10  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  me a D. I got a D, which was unusual. I did get a D in chemistry later  because I   m not a chemistry person, but the two classes I struggled the  most with were art and sewing, of all things. (Laughter)  Oh my goodness. Difference in philosophies.  And a stubborn child. (Laughter)  You attended Edison High School. Did you meet you husband at Edison?  Oh, no. He had just come home from   that   s kind of a cool story. I was  an adult by then. I was twenty-four, and so was he, when we met. I lived  in Tulsa in an apartment. I had a roommate. He had just come back from  Vietnam. He was a photojournalist in Vietnam and had come back and  was ready to settle down and start his life, so he got a job. He   s from  Kansas, originally, but got a job at, it was Tulsa Tribune at the time (it   s  no longer there) and had been in Tulsa for about three weeks and was  kind of lost and kind of lonesome, well, very lonesome.  He met a girl, not me, but he met a girl and invited her over and was  going to make pizza for her, and she stood him up. Hallelujah. She   ll  never know what she missed, but she stood him up. So here   s this poor,  lonely guy, and guys coming back from Vietnam, you know, it was not a  good time. He had borrowed the pizza pan from his brother and sister-in-law,  who happened to live in the same building I did, but I did not know  them. She doesn   t show up, so he gets in the car to take the pizza pan  back. He pulls in the parking lot, and he sees me coming down the stairs.  I   m going to practice my evening exercise, which is hitting tennis balls  up against the school building with no windows. It was a brick wall next  to the apartment house. I come down the steps, and I drop my keys. I  bend over to pick up my keys, and I drop my tennis racket, and I  dropped the can of tennis balls, which go in three different directions.  (Laughter) This is his first vision of me: a little klutz, cute but klutz. He  pulled in and parked and got out of his car and comes.  I see this tall drink-of-water gorgeous guy carrying a pizza pan walking  toward me. I   m kind of gathering everything up, and I stand up. Here   s  this gorgeous guy, and I smiled and said,    Hi,    which is what you  always do. You always smile and greet people. I guess not everybody  does that, but I do. He smiled and nodded and went on.  I go over, and I   m hitting tennis balls against the building. Well, I find  out later he rushes in my entrance of the building, charges through the  building, bangs on his brother   s door, and says,    Here   s your pizza pan   Got to go     Gets in his car, drives all the way back to his apartment, gets  11  Little Thunder  Berry  his tennis shoes and tennis racket and comes back to where he   d seen me  go.  I heard a car pull up behind me about a half an hour later. I turned  around, and if you   ve ever seen the movie Gran Torino, it was that car,  coolest car ever in 1972. Here this six-foot-two-inch guy, tan, just home  from Vietnam, unfolds himself from the car, reaches back in, pulls out a  tennis racket and says,    Would you like to play tennis with something  besides a brick wall?    First words he ever uttered to me. (Laughter)  He wanted to take me to dinner or whatever, a coke or something. I  wouldn   t get in the car with him because I didn   t know who he was, so  we sat on the curb. Oh, I also made him practice tennis, and if he was  too good, I wasn   t going to because I was embarrassed, and he was. I  never did learn how to play tennis. (Laughter)  We talked until the sun went down. It was summer, so that was late. It  was hours. He was so sweet and spoke so friendly. I wouldn   t get in the  car with him, so we talked for hours until the sun went down. He was so  sweet and spoke so sweetly about his family (he   s from a large family)  and all about his life. I guess I was already in love. I finally decided,     This is a safe bet,    so I did let him take me for a coke that night. Then  our first real date was a couple of days later. Six months to the day after  we met, we got married, and it   ll be forty years about a month away  now, December 24.  That   s a wonderful story. Now, you did attend college a little bit?  Yes, a little bit. I always had a tug of war with my mama, God love her.  She always had outlined to me where I would go to school, what I would  major in, what I was going to do. I, again, stubborn child, I was  rebellious enough that I wasn   t going to do that. I finally decided after  years of this all through high school that I would wait and not go to  college. So I did.  I started in the working world right out of high school. It was probably, I  guess, two years after that that I started taking night class. I took night  classes at University of Tulsa, and I did that for two or three years, I  think. By that time I had met Dave, and we were married. I got to doing  the math and figuring at that rate I   d be forty-two before I graduated. I  thought,    I   m not going to do this.     I did, after our youngest started school. At that time we were in  Arlington, Texas, and I did go to University of Texas, Arlington, for a  few classes again. Those were actually day classes because I had kids in  school. That was when I decided, at age fifty-two. I didn   t realize that  12  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  you could start a career in your forties. (Laughter) Little did I know then  that you could do that and have plenty of time to make something of  yourself.  So once you   re married and you   re raising your children, you   re not  really doing any handiwork of any kind, necessarily?  Making Halloween costumes for kids, that   s about it, but yes. We started  doing   Dave, my husband, got interested in genealogy research, so we  were hoping to go back in four directions for the girls, both his parents  and both my parents. As it turned out, the easiest genealogy we found  was   I didn   t think we   d ever find Cherokee genealogy. It turns out  people keep records of things like that and way more. We   ve had to dig  for some of the other relatives but, boy, not the Cherokee stuff. We  found our Cherokee genealogy. This would be around 1980 or so, clear  back to 1750. That began the interest in reading.  I actually bought a history book one time. We had taken the girls to  Gilcrease, had come back up to Oklahoma to visit my parents. By that  time, Daddy retired. They had a ranch in Vinita, Oklahoma, and we had  wanted the girls to see Gilcrease on our way back through town. We  lived in the Gulf Coast of Texas at that time. We bought this history  book, and in the car on the road home, Dave said,    Just for giggles, see  if any of your Cherokee ancestors are in there.    I thought  scoffs . I  opened it up, and they were. There was, like, page after page after page.  I   m thinking,    My gosh     I look up another name, and generation after  generation they were in there. I had no idea, no idea that these people  had been influential in their tribe at all, had no idea. So then I was  hooked.  Tell the story quickly about the great-aunt, was it, or the Native woman  who got a PhD.  Oh, yes. This was my grandmother   s sister. All of my grandmother   s  siblings, they all went to Cherokee Seminary, male and female. Her  sister, older sister, is Dr. Rachel Caroline Eaton. We always call her  Aunt Callie, but it was Dr. Rachel Caroline Eaton. She is, as far as we  know, as far as we   ve been able to find out, the first Oklahoma Indian  woman to earn a PhD. She went to the Cherokee Seminary, and then  from there, all the kids went to Drury College. Then Callie went on to  University of Chicago, which is where she got her PhD.  She became a great educator. Her interests were Cherokee history and  education, history in general but particularly Cherokee history. She went  back later and taught at the Cherokee Female Seminary where she had  gone to school, although it was in a different building by that time, and  13  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  had a distinguished career as a professor and dean of history and so  forth, dean of women at various universities and then later went back to  Oklahoma.  Daddy   s family came from Sageeyah, which is right outside Claremore,  Oklahoma. She went back and became the first female superintendant of  schools for Rogers County in Oklahoma. She was a real trailblazer and  very much a feminist, actually, in those days. She was married for a  brief time and divorced in those days, which was kind of unheard of. She  has begun to get some attention the last few years. People have realized  who she is. There   s a woman now writing a book who has a chapter  about Callie, about women, influential Native women and so forth.  She has written a couple of books. She was a fabulous writer. Her book,  John Ross and the Cherokee Indians, the chapter about the Civil War  was used as an example in college and university composition courses  on a fine example of writing for many years. Up until the 1960s, that  book was outside reading for Cherokee history or Native American  history classes at University of Oklahoma. University of Oklahoma,  sorry, I know that   s competition. (Laughter) She really was a person that  we were all proud of, very proud of. She actually helped my father.  She   s the reason my father got to go to college. Do you want me to tell  that story?  Yes, sure.  Well, he graduated from high school in 1929. It was a terrible time to be  looking for work. He managed to get a menial job at a bank in  Claremore, Oklahoma, which was near where they lived, and worked  there for several months. Finally in the winter of 1930 he, through Aunt  Callie, got an interview with the National Bank of Tulsa, which at the  time was Exchange Bank. He had this interview set up, and a blizzard  came. There was no traffic, and here was this chance to get a job during  the Depression and in the Dust Bowl.  The train ran across the back of our allotment property, and my daddy  put his good shoes and his good pants in a bag and put his work pants  and boots on, hiked back there and flagged the train down, rode the train  into Tulsa, changed his clothes. He walked into the bank and walked  into this guy   s office, and the first words out of the guy   s mouth were,     You   re hired. Anybody who would come to this interview today, I want  working for me.    That is the one and only job interview my father ever  had. He never said a word. (Laughter) I don   t know how I got off on  that, but anyway.  I love that story. That   s a wonderful story. (Laughs) Okay, so you go to  14  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Hobby Lobby, fast forward...  I go to Hobby Lobby.     in the 1990s. Is that right?  Yes, it would   ve been about    91. I guess about    91.  You buy these beads and these books, how to bead. What was one of  your first projects?  I want   to show you. I   ve still got it. This is my inspiration drawer.  Whenever I get to feeling discouraged, I get my old, old, old stuff I think  it   s not something I want to do anymore. I   m not going to show you  everything, but I   ll show you this. This was one of them. Ta-da   Wow  (Laughs)  All right, we   ll put that back. Anyway, so that   s a Southeastern design,  but it   s on Plains beadwork.  Yes, yes. So you already     Yes, so I already knew.  How did you become familiar with those designs?  My family had known Anna Mitchell   s family for generations. Victoria  Mitchell is her daughter. My dad headed the agribusiness department for  the bank and worked with the person who is now Victoria Mitchell   s  husband, Bruce Vasquez, and had worked with him and the ranch that  they now live on forever, I mean, for a long, long time. So we knew  them that way, and then when Mother and Dad retired, they moved and  bought a ranch just north of Vinita and went to the same church, the  Presbyterian Church, where Anna went.  Mom and Dad were real proud of Anna, and they knew I had gotten  interested in all this stuff. There was an article in Oklahoma Today about  Anna, and it had pictures of her pottery. I was first exposed to those  designs that way. Then I don   t know when   I can   t remember when I  found out about the book Sun Circles and Human Hands, but it is a  treasure trove of Southeastern, pre-contact art. I don   t remember the  order in which things happened, but, anyway, it may be when I went to  the library.  I used to go to the library here when I was first doing research on  15  Little Thunder  Berry  beadwork because I couldn   t even ask a research librarian to pull books  for me because if you find something it   s because you just happened on  it. I went to the actual shelves where the Native American books are. I  mean the non-fiction. I would pull a book out, look at it, see if there  were any pictures of what I had come to know was Southeastern stuff,  and I would also look at the bibliographies.  I began to realize there are certain books in every bibliography. That   s  probably when I figured out that Sun Circles and Human Hands was a  must-have. I did that, I mean, you know, book after book after book, trip  after trip after trip to the library just to get tiny bits of information.  That   s when that started.  That   s when Anna   one of the reasons that I figured out that maybe this  could work was because I knew that Anna Mitchell had started from no  knowledge to reviving the art of Southeastern pottery, Cherokee pottery,  hand-coiled. I thought,    It can be done. It can be done. Not that I could  do it, but it can be done.    I thought if I could knock on enough doors and  enter enough contests that maybe it could be done.  I have to give a lot of kudos to Tom Mooney, who is the archivist at the  Cherokee Heritage Center. At the time, years ago, he was the  curator/archivist/the guy that works in the basement. I knew Tom from  toddlerhood. He was born and raised in Mounds, and his daddy and my  uncle were best friends growing up. Tom was aware of the differences in  beadwork, and so when he found out I was doing this, he was very  supportive. That venue has been very good for this work, and the  Cherokee Heritage Center has been behind it 100 percent from the  beginning. Anyway, I can   t remember exactly when everything  happened, but you know   .  At some point you met Anna in person?  Oh, yes. I actually met Anna and her daughter Victoria at about the same  time because the then curator of the Heritage Center, Aaron LeMaster     Vic had come back and started to work with pottery with her mother.  Vic, Victoria, had lived in California. She   d lived in Houston, and here I  came. We had a real similar background, and we   re both trying to get  involved in Cherokee art at the same time. Aaron thought we would be  good for each other, which we were. We   re best friends now, which is  kind of cool to have a best friend that   s 350 miles away. Thank God for  the internet. (Laughter) Aaron kind of encouraged us to get together, and  we did and met.  I would   ve met Anna much before. I had opportunities. Every time I  went to Vinita I had the opportunity. Every time I went to church with  16  Little Thunder  Berry  Mom and Dad I had the opportunity. I was so in awe of her. I mean, I  remember the first time I met her I was a blithering idiot. She kept  saying,    I   m not that special. I   m not that special.    I was at the foot of a  goddess. I think I could   ve really known her longer and learned more  from her had I not been so intimidated by her.  I mean, wow, her talent, her intellect, her wisdom, and her tenacity. I  look at her, and I think,    Okay, I do beadwork, and I goof up, and I can  rip it out or whatever.    Anna makes a pot that she doesn   t know how to  make, fires it in a way she doesn   t know how to fire, and then she takes  it out, and it   s cracked. I can   t even imagine the tenacity it took her to  master that. I would   ve gotten discouraged.  That is one promise I made to myself, though, when I started was that I  would never start a project until I   d finished the last one. I   d never leave  a project undone because I knew I would wind up with a drawer full of  unfinished projects and never get anywhere. I   ve kept that. One time I  had a special thing that had to be done, and I set something aside and did  the other thing and then went back to it. That   s the only time I   ve ever  done that. We laugh because   we live out in the country. We have a  septic system. I don   t have a garbage disposal. We   ve laughed that   s a  good thing because usually about two-thirds of the way through a piece  of beadwork, I want to run it down the garbage disposal. (Laughter) It   s  never good enough. I learn from every piece I make, and I hope that  never changes. If that ever changes, put me in the ground because then  it   s time to stop.  One of the things that you   ve become well-known for are your bandolier  bags. When did you first become aware of bandolier bags? You might  tell us what they are, first, and then how they first aroused your interest.  It   s interesting you say that because I remember one of the first  photographs I ever had of a bandolier bag. I thought they were the  ugliest things I   d ever seen because they   re so different from all these  images that I grew up with and that most people to this day grow up  with, images of powwow beadwork, because you see so many, of  course, at powwow. Here   s this thing called a bandolier bag, and I  thought,    What is that?    The designs were different, you know, and I  thought,    Eww.     A bandolier bag is a pouch that is   the strap is about three or four  inches wide. The center of the strap rests on one shoulder, and the strap  goes across the chest and across the back, hence the name bandolier.  Then there is a pouch on the other end of the strap, which rests on the  opposite hip. They are not as intriguing as early nineteenth-century  sashes. Those are the most intriguing pieces because there   s so much  17  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  mystery, and if you get me started on that, it   ll be tomorrow night before  you get out of here. (Laughter) There is so much mystery about sashes.  Bandolier bags are really the hallmark piece for several reasons. They  were beautifully made, exquisitely made, bold color. The only  background fabric that they had was either a dark navy blue or scarlet,  so all Southeastern beadwork you see is on those backgrounds. The bead  colors are just dynamic. They naturally, when displayed with the two  sides of the strap and then the pouch here, naturally draw your eye to the  center of the flap. If you   re trying to make a statement, that   s where you  want it to be. The cool thing about the flap is that bandolier bags were  made all over North America. Even some of the Plains tribes made  bandolier bags for their horse accoutrements that were worn this way  instead of in a bandolier fashion. The only bandolier bags, essentially  from the very beginning of a really complete, mature art form  that  have  this distinctive triangular flap were the bandolier bags in the Southeast.  Now, the reason that   s important is prior to contact, we know from the  excavations of the mounds, shell carvings, stone carvings, metal  incisings, you see human effigies. In most of these, the characters, the  humans in them, are wearing a pouch on their side. There is a flap on the  pouch that basically comes down like that and comes to a long point,  and it   s worn on the side.  Now, fast forward several hundred years to beadwork in the early  nineteenth century. Here the only people in North America that made  bandolier bags that rest on your  side  and come to a point were the  descendants of the mound builders. This is one of those things that  connects nineteenth century Cherokee with their pre-contact  predecessors. There are other things, too, in our beadwork that does that,  and one of them   do you want me to talk about sashes     Yes.     or is this too early?  No, no, no, that   s great.  Well, the sashes, there are so many things about them that make them so  different. I refer to them as ceremonial sashes because it   s clear that they  were not worn for the same reason as bandolier bags. I mean, people  carried stuff in their bandolier bags. They wore moccasins, they wore the  leggings, and they wore what they call garters, or the knee bands to hold  their leggings together and so forth, all these different pieces of  beadwork, but sashes really stand apart. First of all, the materials are  different. In all the other pieces of beadwork, there   s bold color, none of  18  Little Thunder  Berry  this    You can   t wear plaids with stripes,    kind of thing. I mean, if they  had the beads, they used them, and they   re gorgeous color palettes.  With rare exception, the pre-Removal sashes from the nineteenth  century all use white beads and nothing but white beads, so that   s how  the materials are different. There is a technique   well, I   ll get to that in  a minute. There is a design that appears on sashes that goes directly back  to pre-contact Southeastern mound-builder pottery, and it is on every  single pre-Removal Southeastern beaded sash I have ever seen.  What   s the name of that design?  Well, it   s basically an S curve, but there   s a coil within the S. Basically  you have this, coming down to this. (Gestures) Okay, well, why is this  mysterious, and why is this important? If you   ve ever been to   I have to  be careful when I talk about this because I   m not qualified to talk in  depth about stomp dance, but I will say this because it   s important that  you understand that there   s a connection between, in spite of all of our  changes, nineteenth-century beadwork   there   s a connection directly  back to pre-contact, and this is one of them.  If you ever go to a stomp dance, several times during the night there are  dances that the dancers are going counterclockwise around the fire. Then  at some point the lead dancer, which is a man, takes the hand of the  woman behind him, and then all the dancers take hands. Then the lead  dancer starts weaving through those dancers out away from the fire, and  he comes down and leads the dancers into another circle someplace else.  That is that symbol, and the really cool thing about it is the technique  that is used on sashes, that is a stitch that is only used in Southeastern  beadwork. It is only used on sashes, and is called a two-bead line stitch  or a two-bead flat stitch. It is so elegant. It   s brilliant   The beaders take a horizontal bead and a perpendicular bead, horizontal  and perpendicular, to make sort of a lacey look but within the fabric. It   s  not on the edge, not like two-bead edging. It   s within it, and the sashes  use this. They do that with one stitch. They do the horizontal and a  perpendicular with one stitch. Once I finally figured out how to do it, I  thought,    That is the most brilliant thing I   ve ever seen,    once I finally  figured it out.  So what looks like two rows of beads, a horizontal and a vertical, is  actually one row of beads, but it appears like a little trail, like little  footsteps, exactly like the little shuffling footsteps that you do at a stomp  dance. That stitch, like I said, was only used on sashes. Sometimes it   s  used exclusively, and sometimes it   s used to outline the other designs on  the sash. It   s one of those really intriguing things. We know that we have  19  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  a quote from an elder, Eastern Band elder, saying that they used  beadwork designs to teach the old ways under the watchful eyes of the  missionary instructors even into the early 1900s. So that is absolute  proof that they did that.  That   s wonderful.  Like I said, I   ll go on all day if you get me started  (Laughter)  Thank you for sharing that. When did you enter your first competitive  award with your beadwork, and what kind of a piece was it that you  entered?  Oh, gosh. Actually, I entered what was the Homecoming Art Show way  back before I was doing   I was still learning to make bandolier bags  and things. I was afraid to show them because I really didn   t know if     and sure enough, I was using the wrong materials. I had so much to  learn. I was using these big honker beads. I like tiny beads now.  (Laughter) Anyway, I call them laddy beads because they are big, fat  beads. This was the Cherokee Homecoming Art Show way at the back  of the very beginning when there were just a few entries. I   m not sure  they even gave awards. It may have been an exhibit at first. I took Plains  pipes and did peyote-stitch illustrations of Cherokee myths, the message  being,    What the heck is a perfectly good Southeastern tribe doing on  the Plains?    I showed those, two or three of those, I think.  I remember I think the first ribbon I ever won was at the Homecoming  Art Show. It would   ve been later. It was a little purse that was actually  an Iroquois raised style. I know it   s Haudenosaunee. I know that, but the  style of beadwork is called Iroquois raised. I had at least figured out the  difference between Woodlands and Plains by that time, and so I was  doing those.  I knew that there were little purses like that in the collections of  Cherokee descendants. We know now that they got them through trade.  We have then, since, found examples of actual Cherokee purses, which  are different and which were the key to teaching this beadwork because  they   re small projects that a new beader is not intimidated to do, a  beader can use, can give as a gift, display in a shadow box, carry with an  evening gown, or whatever. That turned out to be the key to teaching  this work.  As you began entering competitive shows, who were some other bead  artists you admired?  Richard Aitson, oh man. (Laughs) We didn   t get along well at first  20  Little Thunder  Berry  because I don   t think he liked the fact that here was this upstart coming  up with this beadwork that nobody had ever seen before, and I was  starting to compete with him for prizes. But I am in awe of him. I   ve  always been in awe of him. Like I said, I love Plains beadwork. It   s just  that it isn   t my work. He is such an incredible artist  Since then, we   ve  become great friends.  He didn   t get to show this last year because he has the same problem I  do: he didn   t have an inventory, or didn   t have enough to make it  worthwhile. I always like to sit down with him in his booth at Cherokee  Art Market and get caught up. I always worry about him because he has  terrible allergy problems, and that   s right smack in the middle of fall  allergies. He never feels very good, and I feel so bad for him. I got to  meet his wife this last time because since he wasn   t showing, he came to  the show and brought her. She   s real sweet. She   s cute. He   s a really fine  man and a distinguished beadwork artist. I really have a lot of  admiration for him.  How did you know how to price some of your early pieces?  (Laughs) Well, they got a steal, let me tell you. I   ll tell you a quick story  about the first   overnight I went from,    I   m never doing this again,    to     Oh my God, this is going to work,    in one night. It was the year 2000,  June, and Tom Mooney had encouraged me to do a show at the Heritage  Center. He had said something about it before, and I said,    I don   t have  enough time.    Then he called me and gave me a year, so I couldn   t   I  was so scared, and I didn   t have an excuse.  I beaded like a crazy person for that whole year. I borrowed two pieces,  and then I had three other bandolier bags, and I had a belt and   oh, I  forgot. There was a couple pairs of moccasins, and I don   t remember. I  had a number of pieces and did a little corner, did a one-woman show. It  opened in June of 2000. It was all for sale, and it was up for the summer,  I guess, until they got ready to hang the exhibit that they were going to  show during Cherokee Homecoming. Thousands and thousands of  people go through the Heritage Center.  Nothing sold, nothing. Not one thing. I thought,    If I can   t sell       and  we have to go back and understand that Cherokees had never seen their  own ancestors    beadwork because it stopped being produced by 1840.  Most of the artifacts are not in Oklahoma. There   s a handful of artifacts  in Oklahoma. It was a very persistent belief that Cherokees didn   t do  beadwork at all, which is ridiculous. I thought,    Gosh, if I can   t sell  Cherokee beadwork to Cherokees        I had this funny feeling, and I call Tom, and I said,    Tom, if you   ve got  21  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  room still for that little corner with this other exhibit coming up and you  want to leave it there through  Cherokee  Holiday, I don   t care if it sells,  but I want to expose people. I want them to see it, get it in front of their  faces.    He said,    Sure,    that they   d have to move it to a small little area,  but that he would do that.  As every year, we go to Cherokee Holiday, we went up there on  Saturday morning and walked in the door. There was a    sold    sign on  one of the bandolier bags. I couldn   t believe it. I just couldn   t believe it.  By the way, they were priced at five hundred dollars. Okay, this is in the  year 2000. I couldn   t believe it. I was so thrilled. We went back and did  our Holiday thing and whatnot. We came back on Sunday and walked in  there, and they were all sold. Everything was sold. I asked Mary Ellen  Meredith, who has always been active with the Heritage Center, I said,     What happened? Who bought what?    She told me that the first one was  bought by Rennard Strickland.  Wow   Wow, I know  My jaw dropped. I was speechless, which as we all know  is unusual. Then I found out that the other people were   Wes Studi  bought one, and, oh, what was his name? The guy they were honoring  that Saturday night, he was president of  ConocoPhillips  oil company at  the time. I can   t think of his name now. Anyway, they were the ones  who bought the three that were for sale.  Apparently there had been a reception that night for the ConocoPhillips  Chairman of the Board, and he was Cherokee. Everybody who was  anybody   we were not invited, but everybody who was anybody was  invited, and it was at the Heritage Center. I don   t know who said what to  who, but Rennard Strickland was quite the little bandolier bag salesman.  (Laughter)  Anyway, when I went up there for Cherokee Holiday, I thought,    I   m  not doing this anymore. I can   t sell it,    and I came back, and I sold  everything. So I really owe a great debt of gratitude, and, actually, that  bandolier bag is now in Oklahoma. It   s at the Fred Jones Museum  collection because Rennard donated his whole collection. So, that   s     yes, I went from giving up to    I can do this,    in one night.  That   s a great story.  Anyway, that was five hundred dollars. Then somebody told me, they  said,    Decide what you want to pay yourself and keep track of your  hours,    which, to this day, I keep careful track of the hours that I  actually spend sitting down at the bench on a piece of work.    Multiply  22  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  that by two,    they said,    and that takes care of commissions or whatever  and then cost of sale.    Well, I don   t have much cost of sale because  beads are not expensive, terribly expensive.  I started doing that at ten dollars an hour. Now I   ve gotten to where I do  it twenty bucks an hour, which considering there   s like maybe a dozen  people in the world who are accomplished at this particular kind of     But anyway, the most expensive bandolier bag I   ve ever sold was two  years ago, and it was for  8,100. So in a decade   s time, they went from   500 apiece to  8,100. They   ve gotten much more elaborate, much  smaller beads. I mean, I   ve improved. Anyway, yes, how do you price  art?  Yes, well, and beadwork   s notoriously underpaid.  Yes. Bill Glass has a great line. When people ask him how long it took  to make that, he   ll say,    Sixty-two years,    or whatever. I said,    Oh, I   m  stealing that     (Laughter)  Are commissions a big part of your work?  They were. In fact, I really got in that commission trap. For a while, I  was the only person doing this work, and people wanted it. It was less  expensive, too, and I was selling it. It was so good to sell it. I was  perpetually out of inventory and booked two years in advance. That  went on for probably eight years, which meant that the work that I took  to shows suffered because you didn   t have enough time. The only big  show, big show, except for Art Market that I   ve ever done is the Heard  Show because I never had enough inventory to make it worth traipsing  across the country, paying your booth and your hotel and food and all  that stuff.  Finally, a couple years ago I thought,    This is killing me.    It was just  killing me, trying to keep up with getting the inventory done, and I  couldn   t have enough to go to big shows. So a couple of years ago I  stopped taking commission orders, with extremely rare exception. Now I  have the student beaders to whom I can give   I   ve never given a  bandolier   I mean, I would give a bandolier bag, but none of them have  ever made one yet. That   s what I consider to be   if you can master a  bandolier bag, you   re a master artist. But moccasins and belts and sashes  and purses and so forth.  I have this little list of beaders that if I get a request, I send it to them.  I   ve finally gotten caught up, so now I   m excited again because it   s my  work. It   s not commissioned. It   s my color choices. It   s my design  choice. I   m really excited going into the next decade, that I   ve learned  23  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  how to do it pretty well now, and I   m doing the work that I want to do.  It   s an exciting time.  Let   s talk a bit about when you started getting into making moccasins. It  sounds like it was kind of simultaneous with the other types of beadwork.  Yes, I figured out that the types of beadwork I needed to be creating  were bandolier bags, sashes, belts, moccasins, and then purses. I figured  you can   t be a Southeastern beader if you don   t have the entire  repertoire. Of course, Southeastern moccasins are real different from  Plains moccasins. Their construction is completely different. It   s made  from   they   re called soft-soled, center-seamed because it   s made of one  piece of leather as opposed to the heavy, thick buckskin at the bottom  and then a lighter-weight leather on top. It   s one piece of leather. It  comes up around the foot, and there   s a seam up the back and a seam up  across the toe. It   s kind of gathered a little bit so that it fits the curve of  your foot.  I did those, and there are actually three styles of Southeastern  Woodlands moccasins. There   s the turndown cuff that you see, and then  there   s a high cuff, which is the cuff that   s higher, kind of comes up,  right at the bottom of the calf and with a leather thong that wraps around  the ankle to hold it in place. Then there   s an arched-cuff moccasin,  which is basically the same moccasin as both cuffs turned down, but the  cuffs are standing up, and instead of a point, they make an arch. That   s  my next moccasin project. I have actually not ever made a pair of those,  but many of the artifacts that we find that are specifically Cherokee have  that arched cuff. So that   s my next project. I   m real excited about that, to  do that. I wrote patterns for people because there   s nothing else out  there.  I saw that on your website.  Yes, and I include all three styles in the moccasin pattern, but I haven   t  yet made that third style. I   m pretty excited about that. They   re also  lined. The artifacts are lined, too. It makes them easier to wear. You  don   t have to wear socks and everything.  So there weren   t any patterns available for those styles of moccasins  before you did them.  No. There are books that talk about how to make a soft-sole, center-seam  moccasin but nothing about the beading or anything like that. I   ve  never seen a pattern for the higher ones. I had to figure out how to do  that. I   d never seen one for the arched cuff, either. The turned-down  cuff, there   s a book about how to make moccasins and from the different  24  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  geographic areas, (there   s different ones) which is an interesting book.  What was an award that was particularly important to you as you  started entering the competitive shows?  People   s Choice, I won one year at the Heritage Center. I won the  People   s Choice Award. I mean, every time I get a ribbon it   s   I get  nervous every time I go to a show. I get flabbergasted every time I win a  prize. It blows me away. I   ve been blessed to win Best of Show a couple  of times at the Cherokee Homecoming Art Show. The one that I love the  most was the one that was for the People   s Choice because that   s when  you know you   re reaching people, and that   s when you know the  Cherokees are beginning to understand,    This is our beadwork.    So bar  none, that one, yes.  Cool. So you have also started teaching beadwork.  Yes. Well, once it began to appear possible to revive this art form, I  knew that there were three things that we had to grow. We had to grow  beaders, we had to grow collectors to make it worth their while, and we  had to grow brokers in the form of galleries and museums to bring the  beaders and the collectors together. It never dawned on me that we  would need to grow teachers. I never foresaw a point where I couldn   t  teach all the classes that anybody wanted. Not that I   m the greatest  teacher, it   s just that I never thought it would revive the way it has this  quickly.  Tonia Weavel, who   s the Director of Education at the Cherokee Heritage  Center, who   s another very, very dear friend, she   s the one that  encouraged us to start an advanced class so that I could teach the  advanced class for them. Then we would start using other people who  had learned to do it to teach the beginning class, which was brilliant  because that   s exactly what we needed: to train the teachers, too. That   s  where there   s an Anna Mitchell influence. Once I get there, I love my  classes. I love the people that are in them. I   ve met the sweetest people,  just the sweetest people and devoted to the art form. I won   t just teach  the technique. I teach the vision.  I start with a PowerPoint that is a blitz of images of artifacts for an hour,  hour and fifteen minutes, and it tells the story of the history of the  beadwork. It   s called    The Rise, Loss, and Revival of Cherokee  Beadwork,    because I want them to catch the vision and to see what an  amazing art form it was, how dead it was, and to see their part in making  history.  Every time I go, I learn from my students, and it   s such a rewarding  25  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  experience. But every time I prepare for class, I hate it. I feel this huge  responsibility to do it and do it right, and it   s a lot of work. Even though  they pay you to do it, still you have to get the materials and you have to  put the kits together. I   m always nervous about it because I want it to go  well. Generally, it   s a great experience. I   ve never had anybody be ugly  to me in class or anything like that. They   re adults; they   re well-behaved.  That   s one of those things that Anna Mitchell always stressed was if you  have a skill that is an ancient Cherokee skill or an old Cherokee skill and  you know how to do it, you have an obligation to teach. You don   t have  a choice. You have an obligation to teach. I took that to heart. It   s  exciting to know that we   re growing teachers now, too. That   s really  pretty cool, and there   s some really good ones. There are some good  ones.  Can you talk a little bit   I saw that there was a specifically titled  Cherokee Beadwork Revival Workshop, I guess, that was sponsored  around 2007.  I basically teach the same beginners class everywhere I go. I   ve taught it  many, many times, year after year after year. It   s an ongoing thing with  the Cherokee Heritage Center. I taught three or four years. I   ve taught  three or four times for the Creek Nation at their museum in Okmulgee,  Oklahoma. I   ve taught it in Chattanooga, Tennessee, in Houston, at  Philbrook. I spent a weekend at Philbrook one time in Tulsa. I   ve  lectured. I   ve done a lecture in the National Liberty Museum in  Philadelphia and the  Bead  Museum in Glendale, Arizona, which is a  part of Phoenix. I   ve been blessed to do that, to spread the gospel,  basically, of Southeastern beadwork, but it   s always basically the same  beginning class.  Okay. And that   s what you call it,    The Revival.     Well, yes, the lecture is    The Rise, Loss, and Revival of Traditional  Cherokee Beadwork.    That   s what the PowerPoint is, and then I usually  teach the PowerPoint again for the advanced class. They tell me,    I   m so  glad you did that again because I saw things this time I didn   t see the  time before.    The only time I didn   t do that was the year that we had the  exhibit at the Heritage Center and we had the actual artifacts.  That was one that you curated, correct?  I did. I did. That was a stunning experience.  Tell us about the title and     26  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Well, the title was    Beadwork Storytellers: A Visual Language,    and  that is taken from a quote from Lois Sherr Dubin   s book where she  quotes an elder of the Eastern Band who talks about the fact that the  people in the late 1700s and early 1800s used beadwork as a way to  continue teaching the old ways, even under the watchful eyes of the  missionary teachers and so forth. He said that the flowers and the other  patterns and the bead colors had meaning, and he said they were  messages and telegrams. This is an old quote,    messages and telegrams,     and he said that beadwork was a visual language.  I   ve always considered it to be a visual metaphor for the time in which it  was created because Southeastern and Cherokee beadwork and the other  tribes, what it is, is all of a sudden they had available to them state-of-the-  art materials, these bold, beautiful beads, bold-colored fabrics, and  gorgeous silk ribbon and all kinds of colors. What they did was take  their ancient design and construction influences and merge them with  what was then state-of-the art materials to create this completely unique  art form.  At the same time, they were merging their blood and the way they  governed their people and the way they handled familial relationships,  their religion. Everything about their life was being merged, and what  they were doing was trying to preserve the best of both and discard the  not-so-good of each. Beadwork is such a perfect visual example of that.  I have no idea how I got off on that. What did you ask me?  Well, about the exhibit and the title.  Oh, and so that   s the reason we entitled that, was that it was a visual  language. We have a benefactor who is always embarrassed and doesn   t  like to be identified, so I   m going to give her credit right now: Robin  Flint Ballenger. Robin Flint Ballenger. she was and is a great patron of  Cherokee beadwork. She got it from the beginning. She has the means to  be able to be very generous, and she was very generous, and she wrote a  fat check that started that exhibit. They asked me (this is the Cherokee  Heritage Center) asked me if I would curate it. I was terrified, but I  couldn   t turn it down.  I began by amassing a collection of a list of the best beadwork that I  knew of, some of which was in Europe. Most of it was in the States, but  very little of it in   I think we had two pieces that were in Oklahoma.  There was a bag here, and there   s a piece here, and there   s a piece here,  all over the country. I   ve been at this twenty years, and I can   t afford to  make that trip. What we did was we brought the beadwork to the  Cherokees. We amassed this collection, and then it came time to contact  27  the curators.  Well, here I am; I never got my college degree. I was terrified, and I had  this list of brilliant, talented, famous people. I thought,    Okay, I   m going  to pick the one on this list that is the least likely to loan us something  and let that be my throw-away first contact because I know I   ll screw it  up.    (Laughter) I contacted Neil Curtis, who at the time was the curator  of the Marischal Museum at the University of Aberdeen in Aberdeen,  Scotland. I thought,    There   s no way. There isn   t any way.     I sent him an email telling the story of what we were trying to do and  thinking I   ll never hear back. The next morning he   s in my inbox, and I  was terrified. I thought,    Oh my God, this is going to be a major  rejection     (Laughter) I opened it up, and he was so excited and so  enthusiastic. That proved to be, with rare exception, a couple of  exceptions, the attitude of all the curators. They got what we were doing,  and they were very generous to loan. We got some exquisite work,  exquisite work, and brought it all together.  I   d never seen art packed the way fine-art shippers pack. I mean, a crate  for a bandolier bag, which is flat and like this, was hip-high on me and  about this wide, thick wood, with it suspended in a little cradle in the  middle. It cost a fortune to do the exhibit. It was the most expensive  exhibit the Heritage Center, bless their hearts, has ever done. Mickel   Yantz  said,    Don   t worry about the cost. I don   t want you to even  know. You just work on what you   re doing.     Then we also did a book in conjunction with that. It   s basically a catalog  except that there were many pieces that were important that were not in  the exhibit. There was some contemporary pieces, as well, that were not  in the exhibit that were in the book. I   d never obtained permission to use  a photograph before. Had no idea there   s, like, a two- or three-page  contract for every photograph. It was obviously a photo-heavy book  because it was all about getting the images in front of their faces. I was  in charge of all of that.  Then, also, I had two experts: Barbara Duncan, who is with the Eastern  Band Museum, Museum of the Cherokee Indian, (she wrote a wonderful  piece about Southeastern beadwork), and also Susan Power, who has  written a book about Cherokee art. She wrote a piece, and then I wrote a  piece. I don   t consider myself a scholar or an expert. I am a student of. I  don   t have the credentials to be an authority on anything. I just told my  story, the things that I had learned as I had learned them. It came out to a  nice little book, and it was a really good opportunity for people to take  the images home with them.  28  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  And it was up for     It was up for six months, 2008 into 2009, over the winter.  What a wonderful thing.  Yes, it was great. The class that I taught during that time, instead of  having the PowerPoint, actually got to go over and see the stuff that I  have in my PowerPoint, the actual thing. It was pretty amazing.  Talking about your techniques and process a little bit more, how do you  think your beading palette has changed over the years?  Well, I used to be very conscious of Cherokee colors, which of course  vary from clan to clan and time to time. Basically it   s east, north, west,  south / red, blue, black, white, which is great, but it   s boring because  there   s no yellows, there   s no greens, and I   m a color freak. I mean, I  have visceral reaction to colors, sometimes good, sometimes not good.  The delight of Cherokee beadwork is that it was an explosion of color.  I have become freer with my choice of color. Of course, I have to use  navy blue or scarlet background, have no choice there, to be authentic in  materials. I   ve been a little bit freer with the colors that I choose and  worked in pastels and so forth. By using inlay, I can use pastel beads on  a fabric inlay. I can use a pastel bead on a navy blue or whatever and  have the true color come out.  I think I   ve become more subtle, and I   ve got my rainbow wall of beads  over here, which is a full color palette that I can pick from. I do still tend  to pick either four or seven colors to do because two, four, and seven are  important numbers to Cherokee. When I use those numbers, things turn  out right, and when I don   t, they don   t. I don   t question it anymore. I just  do it that way. I love color, and I feel more comfortable taking an artistic  license knowing that the beads are still glass and they   re still European  seed beads. I can still, for the most part, use them as authentic materials,  but if I want to use a color that is not typical of those beads and I have a  specific reason for doing it artistically, then I do it. It doesn   t bother me  anymore.  Do you sketch out your designs beforehand?  Oh gosh, yes. Yes. When you look at the old artifacts, then, as now,  there were good beaders and not such good beaders, but it   s very clear  that the good beaders sketch. There   s no way you could   ve done those  things freehand. There   s no way because some of them were very  meticulous and very tiny beads and beautifully done.  29  Little Thunder  Berry  In a bandolier bag, for example, you have three surfaces, shapes. You  have a long, thin shape for the strap, then you have a triangle, and then  you have a square for the pouch. Designs have to be made to fit, and I do  cheat a little bit. (Laughs) Obviously I use electric lights. I use a steam  iron when I   m done. Those are modern. But when it comes to design, if I  find a design I like, I use my scanner or copier to shrink it. Then I think,     Okay, this has to be two and a half inches to get it the size that it needs  to be.    I don   t care. I   m not ashamed of that. (Laughter)  I can   t draw a stick. If I could draw, I   d be a painter and make big bucks,  but I can   t. I take basic designs sketched on a piece of paper, and then I  figure out how much space I have to fill, which determines within an  inch or two the length of the strap and also the size of the pouch. The  proportions are extremely important because Delaware and Shawnee  bags later came to look more and more like Southeastern bags, but their  proportions are very different. Proportion is real important to maintain  the Southeastern look.  I start with sketching, and then I take quarter-inch graph paper, and I  draw everything out and erase and draw and move and erase and draw  until I have the exact design I want. Then I go over that in a black  marker so I can see through fabric. Then I take an unbleached muslin  and lay it over that, and I take a Rub-A-Dub  laundry  marker that will  not bleed or fade and go over the design on the muslin. Then (I can show  you this later, closer) that goes underneath on the hoop, and I draw that.  Then I baste along those lines so that the design comes out in thread on  the top. I can show you that later. It goes from the muslin then so that  the only thing on top of the red wool is the stitching, the design in  stitches, and then bead it from there. Then you put the finishing touches,  put the ribbon on.  I   m big on materials because I just love them. I could say,    Oh, because  it   s authentic,    which it is authentic and that   s important, but I fell in  love with materials. At first, when I started, I thought,    Unless I   m doing  moccasins, I won   t be beading on leather.    Everybody thinks you have  to mess with leather if you   re Native American. Well, they didn   t. The  cloth, I   ve come to love the cloth. I use 100 percent China silk ribbon,  which makes beautiful edgings for everything. The lining materials are  the cotton calico prints like they used to use. I   m a stickler for materials.  And trade cloth, too.  Yes, I use either stroud cloth. They make it now the way they used to  make the stroud cloth, which, by the way, that   s kind of a funny story. I  kept collecting photographs and learning from books, and they would  30  Little Thunder  Berry  say,    Glass seed beads on red stroud, blah, blah, blah. Red stroud, blue  stroud, stroud, stroud, stroud.    I thought,    I have been in fabric stores all  my life. I   ve never heard of stroud.    I swallowed my pride, and I went to  the fabric store, and I said,    Do you carry stroud?    They looked at me  like I was totally crazy. I went through and looked at every label. I knew  it was wool, and, of course, I live in a hot climate. Still, there was no  wool stroud.  By that time there was enough internet that I could do some research,  and I found out that during the time of the American Revolutionary War  and then on up through our Removal (and after it, I assume, but we kind  of quit using that) there were copious amounts of this woolen cloth  made in Stroud, England, a little town southwest of London on the coast.  They shipped it over here, and they also used it to make uniforms.    The  Red Coats are coming,    well, that was red stroud.  About the time I was getting into this, they began to make stroud cloth  for Revolutionary War reenactors the same way that it had been made,  exactly the same way. So I get my cloth from Revolutionary War  reenactor supply houses, and I get the ribbon from a place called  Wooded Hamlet  Designs , which is also a reenactors    supply house. I  get the yarn. I   ve gotten it from all over places, but it   s hard to find wool  yarn in Texas. It   s hot. I get it now from South America, Peru. Then the  beads all come through a Native American   like a powwow supplier,  but I   ll only use European, German, French, occasionally Italian, and  Czech seed beads.  Great. In terms of research, you   ve sort of described some of the kinds of  research you do, but maybe to pick up with your apprenticeship that you  got to do at the Smithsonian briefly, what was the surprise in your  research then?  Well, it was   I got a grant. I   m not sure they even offer it anymore. It  was called the Native American Community Scholars Grant. That   s for  people like me who are not professional scholars but they are working to  help revive and study and do accurately their own tribe   s work. That   s  what I got the application for, and it was for three weeks of study. The  finest shopping trip I   ve ever had was the first day I went into the  Museum Support Center, which is in Suitland, Maryland. It   s not the  museum, itself. This was, by the way, before they built the new National  Museum of the American Indian. This was through the National  Museum of Natural History.  Anyway, so all three weeks was over in Suitland at the Museum Support  Center. It   s huge. My sponsor took me the first day with the little carts,  and she said,    I   m going to show you all of our beadwork because many  31  pieces that are Southeastern are mislabeled.    We looked at every piece  of beadwork with the exception of religious and ceremonial because I  said,    No, I don   t need that. I don   t want to do that.    Most of those were  not my tribe, anyway, so I said,    No.    They were in separate cases. I  went through every piece of beadwork in the Smithsonian   s collection at  the time, which was awesome. If I said I wanted to examine it closer, she  let me.  I also got some pre-contact pottery because I knew at the time the  connection between mound-builder or pre-contact pottery and  nineteenth-century beadwork in designs. I did take some pottery pieces,  too, and worked with those and measured things and that kind of thing.  It was really neat because they had a section of work space that was  about, maybe, six feet long and about three feet across, and it said,     Reserved for fellow,    which was me  It was so cool  (Laughter)  Anyway, it was right outside of the office of Felicia Pickering, who   s  one of the   I don   t know what her title is, anyway, but there at the  Smithsonian at the Museum Support Center.  I remember when I was looking at sashes   I hadn   t discovered this little  stitch that I told you about, perpendicular and everything. I hadn   t  discovered that yet because sometimes you can   t see things in photos. I  was looking at a sash one day, and she   s around   there   s not a door to  her office. It   s when you go around a thing, she   s back there, so she was  within earshot. I must   ve, out loud, said, (Gasps)    Oh my God     because  I   d discovered how this was done  Boy, she was out there like that   (Snaps) I think she thought I broke something. (Laughter) She was out  there like that  I said,    Look at this. I never noticed this before from the  photographs.    She was so pleased and excited that I was so excited. She  said,    I think there may be some more of those,    in with the things that I  had looked at before that were religious or ceremonial.  She and I went back up   she was not my sponsor, but she kind of  babysat me because that   s where   . She took me back up then, and we  found two or three more sashes, and they all had that. Then I knew what  to look for, and then I could spot it in the photo. It   s like once you see  something in a painting, then you can   t miss it the next time.  The really cool thing about that trip and that study is that maybe a  couple years later, I was teaching a class at the Heritage Center, and I  happened to have a pretty good collection of beadwork accumulated,  which is very rare. I took it up there to show people, and I laid it out that  morning on a table so it looked good color-wise, you know, kind of  looked pretty. I didn   t pay any attention to what was what. Just laid it  out for color. About halfway through the day I was at the back of the  room. The students were practicing, and I was going from one to the  32  Little Thunder  Berry  other. I looked up at that table, and I realized that I had laid them out in  chronological order without realizing it, and you could see where I went  to the Smithsonian. You could see it in my work. I thought,    That was a  trip well made.     That is very cool. One of the things that I saw in some of the pieces  you   ve been doing is the use of   you   ll have a Cherokee word, like the  word for butterfly in the syllabary. That   s a cool idea. How did you get  that idea?  Well, I have friends. (Laughter) The first time I used the syllabary  characters was on a commission piece. The Cherokee Phoenix  commissioned me to do a bag to commemorate the tenth anniversary of  the Cherokee Free Press Act, and that was just a couple of years ago, the  tenth anniversary. We wanted iconography that represented Cherokee  visual communication from before contact and into the future.  I had the Phoenix logo, which is the phoenix bird rising out of the  flames. That was in bold color on the flap of the bag with a fire circle  under that, and then the flames coming up and the bird rising out of that,  so this is in the center. What you   re going to be looking at is  counterclockwise. Here   s the flap in the center, and then here up one  side of the strap, over the shoulder, back down the other side, and then  the pouch. Counterclockwise. That   s important.  Then up this one side, the first side, were pre-contact fire symbols  because the phoenix burned in the fire and so forth. Those were fire  symbols. Then across the top I had an image that I designed years ago  and I   ve used several times for DNA, with the drop of blood and DNA,  DNA, DNA, and another drop of blood indicating the time when we  were being influenced by the written language for the first time. Then  down the other side of the strap were the Cherokee characters for the  Cherokee phoenix. That   s the first time I ever used those. Then down at  the bottom of the pouch were the internet iconography for wireless and  play. So we took it from pre-contact, in counterclockwise order, all the  way around to the future. That   s the first time we ever used them, and I  liked the way they looked.  I was nervous because I don   t speak, read, or write Cherokee. In the  process of doing a design and then transferring it over, it   s really easy to  get it backwards. I thought,    Wouldn   t that be horrible to spend 200  hours, plus, and find out you got it backwards?    I sent pictures and  drawings of the quarter, of the mock up, back and forth to Brian Pollard     Look at this. Look at this.    Then I got my Cherokee Phoenix out, and I  looked at that to make sure I had it right.  33  Then came more internet experience and Facebook, and I became a part  of a private group on Facebook, which is a group of Cherokee artists. Oh  my God, I   ve learned so much. We teach each other and have developed  these rich relationships. God, I love the internet  The greatest tool to the  revival of Cherokee beadwork has been the internet. I think that is so  cool. Anyway, several people that are involved in that, who are  Cherokee artists, they   re employees of the tribe and involved in the  revival of the language. I became more interested in that, and we call  them the Tsalageeks. (Laughter) Tsalagi being Cherokee, they   re  Tsalageeks.  I thought to honor them and to kind of do my part to remind people and  get that image in front of their faces, put the images in front of their  faces, that I would do a bandolier bag that was titled Butterfly, but it had  no English. Well, actually it had phonetic English on it. The strap has  the Cherokee syllabary characters for    butterfly,    which is kamama, the  ka character and the two ma characters. The ma character happens to be  my favorite. It   s a long story, but anyway.  I started at the top of the strap with a flower. Inside the flower is hidden  (but you can see it hidden in plain sight) the ka character and then the  phonetic ka in the English letters. Then the next one down was a  butterfly going one direction with a ma character in its wings, and then  the ma, and then a butterfly going the other direction with the ma  character in its wings, and then the ma under that.  Then kind of the same thing on the other side. Then across the bottom of  the pouch in larger characters is kamama and then the Cherokee  characters underneath it. Then in the flap, which is the central focus of  any bandolier bag, was this big giant butterfly. So without saying the  word    butterfly,    people would walk away from that bag, if they really  looked at it, and have learned at least one Cherokee word and that it   s  not so intimidating after all.  Another time that I beaded a Cherokee character was kind of fun. The  Heritage Center did an exhibit called Generations, and they gave to  Cherokees, families, an assignment basically: a seven-by-seven-inch  piece of art. It could be any art form, anything you want, and involve the  people in your family. So my daughter who now is carving gourds and  does incredible prize-winning Cherokee art, she was not doing that then.  My other daughter is the photographer, and so she did a photograph of  the Cherokee seminary. She did a photograph of the Cherokee seminary  because it has so much meaning to us. Then we picked the ma character  because we just liked the look of it. The word kamama is important, (and  that   s a long story to me anyway) which is Cherokee for    butterfly.     34  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  When I write the girls, I always sign it    Mama,    M-A-M-A, so we  picked ma. She did the photograph in the background, and I did the ma  character beaded in front of that on a seven-by-seven-inch piece. That   s  actually the first time I ever beaded a character, a Cherokee character,  was the ma character.  Cool. Well, we are going to wrap up here and take a look at your work,  but I wanted to ask, you   ve described People   s Choice as being a really  high moment for you. What about a low point when you embarked on  this journey?  Oh, I think it would be   well. Oh, boy. Some of that gets kind of  personal. Do you mind?  No.  I think there were two times or two things. One was the fact that we  went up there and I hadn   t sold anything, and then suddenly that had  turned into one of the highest high points. That was kind of a neat story.  I think the other one is it   s been really an upstream swim with some  people to convince them Cherokees did beadwork. I   m thinking, not  only do we have all the artifacts, but they   d have to have been the only  Native American tribe,    Uh, I don   t want to play with those beautiful  things     These were people who had influence, whose opinions were  taken seriously, and who got a little ugly sometimes. Here   s this light-skinned,  mixed-blood from Texas, oh my God, who   s trying to tell these  people something that they just don   t need to know.  Honestly, I don   t know why I stuck with it. I guess it   s that stubborn  child again. (Laughter) I believed in it, and I thought,    Once you see that  work and you see how beautiful it was and you know the soul that  people put into that, like any piece of art, how can you turn your back on  that?    I   d hear these things. Nobody ever said anything to me, but I  heard many, many, many things. I would think,    I hope your own great-great-  great-great-grandmother wasn   t a beader. How crappy would that  be?    That   s probably the hardest thing was I had such an uphill climb to  be accepted and then to have the work accepted.  Now, to be such a part of things, I didn   t think this would ever, ever,  ever happen. To have so many   I mean, my best, best, bestest, bestest  friends are Cherokee artists. Now my daughter is doing   she and I share  a booth at Art Market. My other daughter, she does the All Things  Cherokee website, and she   s involved. She knows all these people.  We   re so well accepted. I didn   t think that would ever happen, so it   s  been the worst thing and now the best. Same thing with the not selling  anything and suddenly selling. It   s like,    Whoa     It   s funny because  35  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  balance is the bedrock principle of Cherokee thought. When you can get  to the point that that finally happens, it   s like,    Yes     It feels so good   Well, that   s great.  This is a bandolier bag. The working title is Legacy. I wanted to do a  piece that was very authentic to the time period, and so I found a  photograph of a bandolier bag that is circa 1830 and that is definitely  Southeastern and is probably Cherokee. It   s classic. The images on both  sides are slightly different, but they always use the same colors  throughout the bag, and then an image down here on the pouch and then  on the fully-beaded flap   or this isn   t fully beaded, but anyway, on the  flap. This is the inspiration for the bandolier bag entitled Legacy.  Then I did a rough sketch, and then I wound up with this for the pouch.  This is quarter-inch graph paper. This is going to be the strap, so it   s  basically the same design. I changed it somewhat because I don   t believe  in copying anybody   s design, old or new, and so I changed the design on  the pouch a little bit, but the flap design is very much like the one on the  old bag. Then I used the same elements on the strap as in the old bag,  but I used them a little differently, and then I used spacers in between.  So it starts out with the image, and then I drew a sketch, and then I drew  everything in detail on the quarter-inch graph paper until I get it the way  I like it. Then I trace the design onto muslin. This is unbleached muslin  that you can lay right down on that and see through it and trace it  perfectly. This will be the pouch when it   s done. I   m starting out with  the strap. This is the strap, which I traced it onto the muslin, and you can  see the design back here. Then I sewed through, all the way around the  design, so that when you turn it over, all you see is the thread. Can you  see that? See the thread in there?  Yes.  So that   s the design that I have on the front. You can see here, the  design, and then you start beading it. I don   t know (and I   m kind of glad  I don   t know) what colors were on the original because that leaves me  freedom to do my favorite thing, which is pick colors. I will eventually  pull up a color photo of this, but I   ve never seen a color photo of this.  We   ll see how close I get when I   m done.  That will be interesting.  Yes. That   s called Legacy. At least I think that   s what we   ll call it. And  that   s how you start them out.  36  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  That   s wonderful. Okay, would you like to tell us about these pieces?  Sure. These are purses, small purses. It took a while to do enough  research to find authentic examples of Cherokee purses created prior to  the Removal. These are made along the same lines as those. They are a  little bit more ornate than those were. I like a little bling, so they   re a  little more ornate. (Laughter) This one is called Ember. It illustrates the  story of the origin of fire where the little water spider brought one ember  from a fire on an island in a lake and brought it back in a little bowl that  she wove from her own silk on her back and brought the fire back to the  people. We see the fire circle on the back of the spider, and then at the  bottom of each of these little curls of smoke (I don   t know if you can see  that sparkle) is one little ember.  Oh, right.  Same thing on the flap, too. That   s what that one   s all about. This one is  called In the Garden, and it   s a floral. The Southeastern beaders,  Cherokee beaders, really loved floral images, and so this one is floral.  The flowers are fully beaded. Both of these have this little twisted bead  handle which is another one we know from an artifact from of 1826 that  had the same kind of handle. Then they all have this distinctive, or many  of them have this looped fringe, which is a very Cherokee purse kind of  thing to do. This one is basically pretty. It doesn   t have a lot of meaning.  It   s meant to be pretty and colorful, and I do love my colors.  Beautiful. All right. We   re looking at your     This is a bandolier bag, and this is a very simple bag compared to what  I   m doing now, normally. It   s called Freedom of Movement, and it is  dedicated to the people who kept our stomp dances alive when they  weren   t free to do so and when they had to do it in secret.  It is purposefully done not elaborately, not a lot of sparkle, not a lot of  glitz. It   s real simple, and these are the designs. In fact, the strap is made  just like a Southeastern ceremonial sash would   ve been made. This is the  little stitch that we talked about, the two-bead line stitch or the two-bead  flat stitch that is unique not only to the Southeast, now, not on the edge.  A lot of nations did that, but when you see this design within the design  on the fabric, that   s unique to the Southeast, and it is unique to  ceremonial sashes, but I borrowed it to use for a bandolier bag because  that   s who I   m honoring in the bandolier bag.  The colors are the colors that are important to the Cherokee. White is the  color of peace, and red is the color of new life. Blue is the color of cold  and trouble. I did not put any black on this because black represents  37  Little Thunder  Berry  Little Thunder  Berry  death. So that   s Freedom of Movement.  That   s beautiful.  Thank you.  All right, well, thank you so much for your time today.  Oh, you   re welcome  This has been great fun   -------  -------
