 Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Today is Friday, April 6, 2007, and we are here in the Angie Debo Room  at the OSU Library on the campus of Oklahoma State University. My  name is Jennifer Paustenbaugh, I   m Associate Dean for Planning and  Assessment with the OSU Libraries and I   m here with President David  Schmidly who has been the President of Oklahoma State University from  2003 to 2007. We   re here to talk about some of the highlights of his  administration and some of the things that have gone on, on campus, for  the last four years.  I know that when you came here, I heard you say several times that you  wanted to be a president of a land grant university in a state where a  land grant university was really making a difference. Could you  elaborate a little bit on that?  Well, the land grant system really touched my life from the time I was a  young boy all the way through my development as a professional. I was  born and raised on a cotton farm, and we relied extensively on our  county extension and our home demonstration agents that were part of  Texas A M   s land grant program. So when I graduated from Texas  Tech, I went to the University of Illinois which was the first land grant  university. And when I graduated with my PhD from the University of  Illinois, I was hired at Texas A M, which was Texas    land grant  university. I was hired into the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences  and I had an appointment with the Texas Agricultural Experiment  Station, extension service and the university.  So you were thoroughly indoctrinated in land grants    (Laughs)  I was indoctrinated, and I   m a big believer in the land grants because  their mission was to bring education to the masses, to the common  people that typically couldn   t access an education. I think it   s one of the  greatest pieces of legislation ever passed in the United States, the  5  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  establishment of land grant universities. I think if you look at that and  the GI Bill, those two pieces of legislation have probably had more to do  with producing the kind of economy and lifestyle we have in this  country than almost anything else because it has provided us the  opportunity for those people that want a college education, whether  you   re rich, poor, come from nobility or just very common   it opened  the doors of access for higher education.  I always said if I had an opportunity to become president of a land grant  university in a state where it still mattered   well, in Oklahoma it still  matters. It matters because you   ve still got almost forty percent of the  people in Oklahoma that live on the land. They live in rural areas. There  is still a very low percentage of the population in Oklahoma that has a  college degree, much lower than the national average. So a land grant  university that can serve these rural constituents and open the doors of  education to them and provide access for more Oklahomans to get  college educations is very important to the future of this state.  If you look at Oklahoma State, it has an office in every county in  Oklahoma. It has five campuses   soon to have two more, one in Ponca  City and one in Ardmore. It has a medical school that trains most of the  rural doctors that practice in Oklahoma. So this university, this land  grant university, is of enormous importance to the future of this state.  And it   s just been an absolute pleasure for me to spend four and a half  years here. It   s just been a delight, and I have found the people of  Oklahoma State to be very much like the people of Texas A M. They  embrace the land grant mission. They have tremendous pride in the  institution, and that   s typical of your strong land grant universities. So  that was very important in my decision to come to Oklahoma State,  probably the most important factor was the chance to be able to lead a  land grant university.  I realize there were many things that were part of your decision to go to  New Mexico, but they are not a land grant institution     No, they   re flagship, so this is a different phase of my career. That was  driven more by family and personal considerations really.  Sure.  You know, my wife and I made a decision three years ago that we would  eventually retire and move to New Mexico to live because of the  landscape and the climate.  It   s beautiful.  6  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  It is, and it   s the sort of landscape and climate that I grew up in as a field  biologist that I really like and it   s where I want to live. We had no idea  the presidency would ever be an option for us there. Then my son and  his wife decided to relocate to Albuquerque from Mexico, and they  bought a home not a mile away from where Janet  Schmidly   s wife  and  I are. So we have here a chance to go and work for five years in a place  where we   re going to retire. That   s an enormous opportunity for a good  retirement, but we also have a chance of reuniting our family. Our son-in-  law and our daughter who live in Connecticut need to live up there a  few more years and then there   s a chance they may relocate to  Albuquerque. So this was just something from a personal point of view  that we really felt was an option we could not say,    No,    to.  Well, absolutely. And it   s wonderful that it appears to have worked out  so well for you.  It did. It   s just   sometimes, you know, it   s like people say,    The stars  align.    The University of New Mexico needed experienced leadership  and they have had four presidents the last five years. So, they recruited  me very strongly and as I got more and more into the recruitment and  discussion with them and realized these personal aspects of possibly  going there, that   s really what drove that decision. The decision to come  from Texas Tech to Oklahoma State was driven more by my love of the  land grant mission and the opportunity that I saw in Oklahoma, where  this land grant university really is. It   s not departed from the land grant  mission, and there is still the need for it in this state.  When you came to Oklahoma, you came here after one of Oklahoma   s  own  referring to David Boren  was well established at the University of  Oklahoma, and yet you appear to have really thrived in this environment  where David Boren has an awful lot of say about what goes on. Can you  talk a little bit about that?  Well, I decided early on   I met David, and I really liked him. You have  to admire what he   s done at OU  University of Oklahoma . He   s done a  spectacular job, and he   s a very bright, sharp man, and what I discovered  was   what the man was really most interested in was good things for  Oklahoma. Yes, he wanted to represent OU and succeed in that regard,  but he really had this broader view. You would expect him to because he  was a governor and a U.S. senator. So, David and I, we really hit it off.  We decided that, look   we need to compete on Saturdays and a few  nights a week, but other than that we ought to try to formulate a vision  for higher education in the State of Oklahoma that would benefit both  OU and OSU and ultimately maximize the benefit of those two  institutions to the state. So we worked together very closely with the  legislature trying to get the bond issue that ultimately was passed, trying  7  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  to get tuition deregulation so that we could strengthen both of our  institutions, working on capital projects that complemented one another  instead of competed with one another, and I am proud to say that I have  had a very good professional and personal relationship with President  Boren, and our wives as well. So it   s just been one of the highlights of  being in Oklahoma has been to get to know David and to watch his  leadership because he   s outstanding.  Well, I would like to turn a little bit now to some of your presidential  initiatives.  Okay.  I know that strategic planning has really been one of the hallmarks of  your presidency here at OSU. What is your assessment of the process at  OSU and are there things that surprised you that were accomplished,  and were there things that you wish could have been accomplished but  that weren   t?  Well, I think that   s always true, Jennifer, that, you come into any  presidency with big ambitions, and, you know, I   m a real fan of Yogi  Berra. (Laughs) He   s, in many ways I guess you   d say, my favorite  philosopher. Yogi said one time,    You know, if you don   t know where  you   re going, you might not get there,    (Laughter) and that   s always  stuck in my mind. And when I got here, I had just observed after a few  months a real need for this institution to have a strong sense of where it  was going to go and that the timing was right to really do a  comprehensive strategic plan that involved all the faculty, the students,  the alums, the leading citizens of the state, and really talk about what  this land grant university ought to be doing for the State of Oklahoma,  and we did that. It was painful, as strategic plans often are. They require  people to spend a lot of time and you have to talk about a lot of things,  and you don   t always get your way, and other priorities emerge. So it  created some frustration, but I think the bottom line was it also created  some unity around a vision of what we should be doing. And I think  we   ve made progress in each of those.  The four big areas that emerged   one was access. The second was  affordability. The third was excellence, and the fourth was student  success. And, you know, what we were trying to do was align every  aspect of Oklahoma State so that we could make progress on those four  big factors, and I will tell you those are the four biggest issues facing  higher education in this nation today. Those are the four big issues. So  what I wanted was a strategic alignment of the Alumni Association, the  Foundation, the athletic program, all of our branches, our Parents  Association which we started. I wanted every aspect of this university to  8  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  be aligned so we could really make progress in those four factors. And I  think we have done that.  We have had to raise tuition, but even though we have raised it, we still  have the lowest tuition among our peer group, the Big Twelve, so we   re  very affordable. We have improved the student body. We did that by  slowly raising our admission requirements, but because we were a land  grant university we did not want to turn the spigot of access off. So, we  formed a partnership with Northern Oklahoma College and we created a  Gateway Program so students that would not quite meet our new  admission standards could go spend twenty-four  credit  hours at  Northern Oklahoma College right here in Stillwater, live in our  dormitories, access our facilities, but once they completed those twenty-four  hours and hopefully were better prepared to succeed, they could  transfer right into the university, and I think that program has been a  success. And then on the student success side, we worked very hard to  increase our graduation rate, to make sure that more of the students that  we admit into the university stay here, they succeed and they graduate  on time.  And I think I read that the graduation rate has increased by, like, 7.7  percent     It has.     since you came here. That   s really a huge accomplishment.  It think it is. We decided that we would measure the success of our  strategic goals and we would be very transparent in how we displayed  those publicly. So, we created what we call the Academic Ledger  System and it measures performance at the university as a whole, in each  college and down to each department. We put that on our web site and  so any citizen in Oklahoma can go look and see how we   re doing. And if  you look at that report card, as I call it, you will see that there have been  major improvements all across the board at Oklahoma State.  When I got here, we were definitely challenged in terms of diversity in  our student body, diversity in our faculty and diversity in the  administration, and in this global world we now live in, it   s very  important that you educate students in a diverse environment, and so we  have worked very hard to make improvements. The number two person  that I hired to be second in command of the university was a woman,  Marlene Strathe, to be Executive VP and Provost. She   s done a  wonderful job. We started the Division of Institutional Diversity, and we  recruited an outstanding African American, Cornell Thomas, to lead our  efforts there, and we   ve made some real progress. I think there   s now a  9  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  forty-seven percent increase in African American faculty, twenty-something  percent increase in African American students since I came  here. The numbers are not quite that high on the Hispanic side, but  nonetheless we have seen significant improvement. There   s been a  twenty-two percent increase in female faculty since I came here. Those  are really significant achievements in my regard, from my perspective,  and I think they will really contribute long-term value to the university.  You know, I also felt that there were a couple of other critical issues,  one was the university needed to do more to contribute to the economy  of Oklahoma, both regionally and statewide, so we formed a Center for  Innovation and Economic Development, CIED. We formed it as a  501(c)3  a not for profit organization , and it   s been very successful. If  you look here in Stillwater, there are a number of spin-offs that have  come out of the university that have produced high-tech development  here. We have started our National Sensor Testing Facility in Ponca  City. That   s a partnership with ConocoPhillips and a private sector  partner, SAIC, and then we are going to have a wonderful partnership  with the Noble Foundation in Ardmore when we open our new facility  down there that will focus on biofuels and biotechnology   plant  biotechnology research and development and economic spin-offs. So I  think those have all been positives for the university. It will grow its  research efforts and also strengthen its economic development portfolio.  I think we   ve accomplished a lot of what we talked about in the strategic  plan   not everything   and you would always like to do better, but  we   ve given this university a vision for the future. It is achievement-oriented  now. It is ambitious, and I think it   s well positioned for the  future.  I think one of the things that you   ve done to increase diversity on our  campus is not just through the Office of Institutional Diversity and the  effort that Cornell Thomas has made and the faculty hiring and some of  the things that you   ve pointed to, but also some of your new initiatives in  Mexico. Could you talk a little bit about that and why you think it   s  important that Oklahoma State knows more about Mexico and that  Oklahomans know more about Mexico?  I sure can. Of course, coming from Texas and seeing the demographic  shift and the northward spread of the Hispanic influence, when I got here  it was very obvious to me that it would just be a few years before  Hispanics would come to Oklahoma in sizeable numbers and begin to  impact the culture and the economy of the state, and we are in fact  beginning to see that happen.  Yes.  10  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  The U.S., and Oklahoma   s not very far from it  Mexico , shares this  enormous border with Mexico, and we   re really   whether we like it or  not   we   re very connected. We   re joined at the hip, so to speak. So I  felt like it was important for our students to have opportunities to go to  Mexico and study and learn the culture. I also felt like it would really  benefit Oklahoma if we could bring more students from Mexico here to  study at the university, and that culturally as we brought Oklahoma  together with Mexico there would be opportunities to better assimilate  Hispanics into Oklahoma, and second, there would be major economic  development opportunities.  I   ve traveled a lot in Mexico. In fact, I   ve driven every highway in the  Republic of Mexico. I know Mexico better than the United States. My  son lived down there for almost seven years. He   s married to a young  woman from Pueblo, Mexico, and when educated and empowered, the  Hispanic people are enormously good people. They have great family  values. They   re hardworking people and they could contribute so much  to the future of Oklahoma positively. So what we   ve done is we   ve  opened some offices in Pueblo. We have partnerships with two major  universities here. We have started a summer immersion Spanish  program there for our students. We have now placed a lot of our students  down there to go to school for a year. I   ve had some of them come by to  see me, and they just have a wonderful experience.  Now we   re beginning to recruit students from Mexico here and the most  recent thing that was encouraging was our person in Mexico, Jose  Cerenauga, has had   he   s really good, and got the government of  Pueblo, the city and the state of Pueblo, to provide funding for twenty  students from Mexico to come to Oklahoma State University, almost   200,000 American dollars. That   s an enormous step in the right  direction, so I think you   re going to see that Oklahoma State, in the  future, in terms of its international programs   you   re going to see that  it   s very well positioned to have a very strong partnership in Mexico.  We talked a little bit about strategic planning. One of the things I  wanted to ask you about was the Campus Master Plan. Since Henry G.  Bennett   s presidency and his great initiative with the Twenty-Five Year  Capital Plan this institution has not focused very much on a campus  master plan. Can you talk a little bit about that process and also, you  know, twenty-five years from now, what features are going to be pointed  at as, this came out of the Schmidly era, like we point to the quads and  the modified Georgian architectural style as features of the Bennett era?  Well, you know, in the process of doing our strategic plan, we identified  so many building projects that were needed. The university hadn   t built  a lot of academic space for a long time. It also had a very degenerating  11  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  infrastructure for its athletic programs. The football stadium when I got  here, by any measure, was clearly the worst in the Big Twelve and so we  identified a need to do that. So you   re going to do all of this building,  and then we went to the legislature and got a lot of the money, and then  we got a lot of it from the private sector. We realized we were going to  build probably in the next five years a half a billion to three-quarters of a  billion in new facilities. So we felt like it was time to revisit the master  plan, build off the old Bennett principles, but make sure as we had this  big growth and development that we would do it in a way that would be  consistent with the architecture and consistent with the Bennett plan.  And it was very painful, the master plan was, and I think it was  primarily painful because it got into this issue of the Athletic Village.  Right.  And, of course, the creation of the Athletic Village involved the  purchase of land. It involved a dramatic expansion of our athletic  facilities, and that   s always a controversial thing. If you go back and  revisit the master plan, there was very little objection to any of the  academic building.  Right.  Most of the controversy had to do with the Athletic Village, and when  the dust is settled on this phase of planning at OSU, I have no doubt in  my mind the end result will be a focus on the Athletic Village and the  development of that as the primary thing that came out of this master  plan. But the reality is although that will be the focus   because, I mean,  that   s just the way the public is. If you go back and look at all of the  building, it   s just about equal between academics and athletics.  Right. Well, I think the fact that it expanded the campus northward and  was in such a concentrated area that people will look at that, as you  said, and not all these new academic buildings scattered around the  campus.  Right, but those new academic buildings are very important to the future  of the university. This new Interdisciplinary Science Building, the new  Architecture Building, the new Classroom Building, the renovation of  South Murray over here   all of these facilities are so sorely needed for  the academic growth of the university, and we were able to get funding  for all of those. And then, of course, thanks to the generosity of one  individual  T. Boone Pickens , we were able to get a major gift that  moved us in the direction of being able to accomplish the Athletic  Village. Most of the controversy has settled down. People initially saw  this kind of as a cheap land grab, I think, sort of a bullying approach, but  12  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  I think in reality the way it   s been handled, we proved to people that was  never the intention and never the case.  Right.  People have been paid more than fair for what their property is worth.  With the exception of maybe one individual, everyone is extremely  satisfied, and we   re able to now build these facilities that will really help  the public image of the university nationwide and help its athletic  programs and ultimately its academic programs.  I guess one final initiative that I wanted to ask you about before we  move on to another topic is that you have   I think that this has been  important to you   your involvement with the Honors College and the  Scholar Development Program and especially with the Cambridge  initiative. Could you talk a little bit about that?  Well, you know, I mentioned those four big factors and under  excellence, what you want in any academic institution   you always  have a certain number of students that are just truly exceptional. These  are the brightest young men and women you have on the campus, and  they are ones that are really interested in scholarship. They don   t want to  just be in the classroom and then go to their sororities or fraternities or  their dorms and then be left alone. These are young people that are so  sharp. They   re looking for special experiences.  When I got here and saw the Young Scholars program in place and met  some of these students and realized how truly outstanding they were and  then I met Bob Graalman, and Bob Graalman is like   he   s like your  Hall of Fame basketball coach. I mean he truly is. He takes these young  men and women and develops them as scholars and spends enormous  time with them and invests energy in them so they have this ability to  get these special experiences. And I decided that as President that I  really need to put strong support behind Bob and that program. So we  tried to provide more resources to Bob, and then I personally  volunteered to teach as part of the Cambridge program. I was able to do  that. I was able to travel to Cambridge with these students, and then     when you   re around them, you really get hooked and see how bright  they are and how wonderful they are. I think one of the highlights at  Oklahoma State and I certainly don   t deserve credit for it   Bob  Graalman and many faculty have worked with these young men and  women   but one of the highlights at this university is to look at these  young scholars and see what kind of credibility they brought to the  university and what they   ve done in their personal lives as a result of  being Oklahoma State students.  13  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Well, this is a perfect lead-in. I wanted to talk to you about the different  constituencies that make up OSU and, of course, students   you   ve been  such a student-focused president and you   ve talked a little bit about  some of these students that are exceptionally bright and have been part  of this program. What do you think makes OSU students in general  different maybe from students on other campuses?  I think a lot of it goes back to the land grant business. Many of them  come out of these small rural communities, you know. They grew up on  farms and ranches, working early in life, being responsible. They grew  up in a church environment where ethics and honesty were stressed, and  they grew up in some of the smaller schools where they participated in  everything. You know, I   m amazed at how many kids I meet here that  played on the football team, the basketball team. They were in the band.  They were on the debate team.  Right.  As you know, when you do that, you develop confidence in yourself, but  you also develop pride, pride in being a good person and pride in being  part of the family. And to me, what separates Oklahoma State from any  place I   ve ever seen or been is the pride that its people have in the  institution and the devotion they have to it. I mean, there is really  something to this    orange power.     It   s not just a color people wear on Saturday. It is a piece of their heart  and their love of this place. It   s an expression of that, and you see it in  the students. I mean, they come to school here. They fall in love with  this place. They become devoted to it, and it matters to them, and that   s  why they get involved in it. The student organizations here are  wonderful. The fraternity and sorority system here is probably the best  I   ve ever seen, and, you know, look how close those Greeks are located  to the campus. They are integrated as part of the campus and they  become   a lot of our campus leaders come out of the Greek system, and  for the most part we have very few problems with the Greek system  here. It   s mostly a very strong bunch of young people where leadership  is very much stressed.  Oklahoma State has a lot of great assets. Its greatest asset is the quality,  in my opinion, of the student body and the involvement of its student  body and the bonding that those students get when they attend school  here. Then they become alums but they still carry that strong bonding to  the university. And then when they become successful alums, they want  to give back and help the university succeed.  Maybe the greatest example of the alum I   ve met in that regard is Ross  14  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  McKnight. Ross was a kid that didn   t have a lot growing up. I think he  was raised by an aunt, pretty much. He found his way to Oklahoma State  and probably might not have gone to college had he not been able to  come here. He got involved with student leadership, got into the Greek  system, became student body president, became very successful   and I  don   t think I   ve ever seen an alum of any organization anywhere   any  university   that loves a university more than Ross McKnight loves  Oklahoma State University. And he will tell you when you sit down with  him personally   and he will get teary-eyed about it   this place made  his life. It became his family and that meant so much to him   he could  have sent his kids   I   ve met them all and they   re bright as can be. They  could have gone to Harvard and Stanford or any university in the United  States. He sent them here because of the value of the experience that a  young person gets here, and I think that is a real testimony that so many  Oklahoma State graduates send their sons and daughters and their  grandsons and granddaughters back here to go to school.  Right.  And they do that because they look back at their time here and they see,     This place made a real difference in my life.    And that   s powerful.  That   s very powerful.  I have been really amazed at the number of fourth-generation     Oh        students that I   ve met here. I mean, when you consider how young this  institution is, that really is a very remarkable thing to see the number of  people who, you know   it   s just a family tradition. You go to OSU.  (Laughs)  Well, you know a lot of those stories emerged when we did this book on  Celebrating Oklahoma   s Centennial  the book   s full title is Oklahoma  State Portraits: Celebrating the Centennial of Oklahoma Statehood  and  the contribution of Oklahoma State to the State of Oklahoma   the  contribution of our graduates   and if you go through that book, and it   s  a beautiful book     It is.     beautifully done book   the stories that come out of there are really  powerful, and I think they really tell the story. That book tells the story  of the power of the land grant university in the state.  I   m glad you mentioned the book because I didn   t have it on my list of  15  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  questions, and that book has been very visible.  It is. It   s a good book because, you know, Oklahoma has a wonderfully  rich history. It has a great history, and the land grant university has been  part of it before statehood and to be able to look at that, look at the many  contributions   you know, our oldest living graduate lives in Arkansas     I think she   s 107 years old   and she   s interviewed in the book, and  that   s an amazing interview.  I   ll bet it is.  I mean, she was a student here in 1919. That   s right after World War I  was over. She was a cheerleader and still remembers all the old cheers.  She remembers who her teachers were. I mean, I   ve never seen a person  that could express more eloquently what a university education meant to  them than this woman, and I think that   s a wonderful story for people to  be able to see about our university.  I would have loved to have been part of that interview. (Laughter)  You would really have liked it, Jennifer.  Well, we   ve talked a little bit about students. Let   s talk about the OSU  faculty. I know you   ve had a very interesting dialogue with our Faculty  Council. Can you talk a little bit about that and about our faculty in  general?  Well, I think the faculty here is very strong, and I think it   s not unusual  that faculty councils and presidents have a little friction. In fact, it would  be unusual     To not.     if they didn   t, okay? But overall, I have felt very good about my  relationship with the faculty, and for one reason. You know, I pride  myself in being a member of the faculty. While I   ve been here, I   ve  taught, I   ve published, I have a graduate student that I   m working with  to finish right now. I   ve given a lot of lectures to people   s classes. The  academics are the heart and soul of an institution, and I have tried to  conduct myself as President in a way that respects and understands that,  and I believe I have.  I worked very hard to improve the situation for faculty here, both from a  salary and a retirement point of view. One of my concerns when I got  here   and it didn   t take me very long to realize there was a lot of faculty  turnover   and, in particular, a lot of the faculty that would come and  16  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  stay a few years that looked like they could be really good, those faculty  were very easily recruited away from us. And when you ask them why  that happened, it was typically about salary and benefits and particularly  the fact that this retirement system needed to be improved. So we  worked very hard on those areas. We created this Restore, Reward and  Grow the Faculty program.  Right.  We had a hundred vacant faculty positions when I got here. Most of  those are gone now. They   re filled. We have raised salaries, I think, on  average right around fourteen, fifteen percent, and a little bit higher than  the average of the Big Twelve over this four and a half, five year period.  We have begun to grow faculty, and have been hiring really good young  faculty and investing in them, and slowed down the faculty turnover. So  I think the faculty are being strengthened. Most of the friction has been  about, I think, style and the fact that I wanted to move very aggressively  in some areas, and that   s always a problem for faculty. You know, they  want to debate and talk and I don   t have any problem with that, but there  is a time when the debate and talking needs to be over, a decision needs  to be made and you need to move on   and so that   s the kind of person I  am. I told the faculty I was that way when I got here. I don   t think they  were surprised by it, but at various points in time, it has created a little  stress, but I don   t feel like I   m leaving here an enemy of the faculty at  all. I really don   t, and I think most of the faculty that really look at what  we   ve done here   and I   ve had many of them come by and tell me that  they really appreciated the focus that I put on faculty here.  Well, during your presidency we received some of the largest gifts that  the institution has ever received, the largest one from a foundation to the  university with the Reynolds    gift for the School of Architecture  Building, and also with, of course, Mr. Pickens    gift of  165 million. I  know that relationships with donors are always interesting, having been  a development officer myself for five years here. You know, the bigger  the donor, sometimes the more interesting the relationship or the more  challenging it is. Can you talk a little bit about some of our bigger  donors and the challenges that have been presented to you in working  with them?  Sure. We have been fortunate to have many good gifts. You mentioned  some of them   the largest gift from a foundation. We also had the  largest gift from a private individual for a facility. That was Mr.  Helmerich in Tulsa for the Helmerich Advanced Technology Center,  and then we had our first endowed college in the history of the  university. That was Bill Spears for the College of Business. Then, of  course, there   s no question the largest gift in the history of the NCAA  17  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly   National Collegiate Athletic Association  was provided here and that  was from Boone Pickens. With regard to the relationships, you always  ask yourself,    How do you get those kinds of gifts?    And I think the  answer is, for us   is that we were able to, as a result of the strategic  plan, show a very powerful vision of what Oklahoma State is capable of  and what investing in it means for the future of Oklahoma and for the  future of this institution. I know the Reynolds Foundation in Nevada had  told us,    No,    on virtually every occasion. And I think the reason was  they had not seen that we had a strategic vision and a direction for how  their gift would improve the university and improve the state, and I think  we approached them that way very strategically and we were successful.  Walt Helmerich, you know   he had been primarily a donor to the  University of Oklahoma.  Right.  But Walt is a Tulsan, and I think he   s very concerned about the future of  Tulsa and the ability to get the high-tech sectors into Tulsa. We were  able to take that approach with Walt and get a very nice gift, and then  Bill Spears   in many ways, Bill is the perfect donor. (Laughs) He   s a  very gentle man. He   s not a guy that tries to control things. He has   he  made his gift. He   s very involved. He   s very supportive, and he has been  a delight to work with.  I like Boone a lot, and I admire Boone. Boone made his own money. He  made his own way, and he didn   t get there without being tough, and he   s  a very tough businessman, but I really like him. We haven   t seen eye to  eye on a lot of things, but that   s all right. I mean, that   s the way things  go sometimes with donors and university presidents, but I think all in all,  we   ve been able to nurture Boone   s gift for the betterment of the  university. I think Boone had a vision that the first step in making the  university better was to make its athletic program better. I would agree  with that partially, but not totally.  I wish we could have structured Boone   s gift where it had a little more  impact on the academic side. He said that will come later. There   s no  question that Boone and I disagreed over the future of Hall of Fame and  some other things that related to how this community felt about building  that athletic village. It was my feeling that the university over time could  not succeed without being a partner with the community and that we  develop the athletic village with the understanding of that partnership  and that it was important to keep Hall of Fame open for the community,  and that maybe over time we could move in a different direction but in  the short-term it was important to keep that artery that most people  believe is so vital to Stillwater functioning. When we were talking about  the athletic village, we had a lot of tough public meetings. I think they  18  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  were very important in getting us to a point where we could move  forward positively. I think people in the community had a right to say     and they needed to say     Right.     what they felt about the athletic village, and I think   yes, it was  painful. It was certainly painful for me, but I think it was important that,  as leader of the university, I be in front of the public and I answer their  questions and I answer them honestly and I listen to them, and we made  some adjustments as a result of that, and I think that it has   now I think  where we are, it   s paid off. I certainly leave here with high regard for  Mr. Pickens. I appreciate what he did for the university, and I hope that  he will be supportive of the next president. I   ll be shocked if he   s not,  and I look forward to the day when Boone not only helps us reach the  pinnacle athletically, but he also helps this university reach the pinnacle  academically.  --- End of April 6, 2007 Interview ---  Today is Wednesday, April 25, and this is Jennifer Paustenbaugh, and  I   m here in the Angie Debo Room in the OSU Library with Dr. David  Schmidly, who has been President at OSU from 2003 to 2007. This is the  second time that we have met to talk about his presidency here at OSU  as well as some of his life experiences. We   ve just been talking about the  Dust Bowl in west Texas and Tim Egan   s book, The Worst Hard Time,  and some of his experiences with his family, and you had mentioned in  our first interview that you had grown up on a cotton farm and so   I  guess one of the things that interested me is that I assume that your  parents probably weren   t college educated, that you were the first  member of your family to receive a college education. Was that  something that was always part of your plan or   that you received  encouragement to do, or how did that really come about?  Well, it was a result of my parents. They were not educated. Both of  them finished high school, then Dad, of course, came back from the war   World War II  and his father had lost a leg so he took over the farming  to support not only my mother and myself and my brother, but to  support his parents.  For some reason, I guess it was just the luck of the draw, my dad could  see that agriculture didn   t have a long-term future. He used to tell me  that. He would say,    You know, this water is going to give out. The  world economy will change.    And my mother was a real stickler about  doing well in school, and she was also a real stickler about reading and  taking care of business, and so I only went to town on Saturdays and  19  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Mother would take me to the library and she   d make me check out a  book. She had to approve it. It couldn   t be just some, you know, just  ordinary book, and then I had to read it during the week. I had to tell her  what was in it, and I   d take it back next week and exchange it for  another book. And that went on year round.  I remember when I went to school   the first day I went to first grade.  My dad drove me in his old pick-up truck, and he took me up to the  school and he said,    Now look, boy.    He said,    You   re here to learn. I  expect good work, and God help you if you get in trouble (Laughter)  because it   s going to get a lot worse when you get home.    (Laughter)  And he said,    So you behave. You do your work, and then this is what  will make something out of you.    So as long as I lived with my parents,  education was stressed and so as a result, I ended up, from parents that  never went to college, I ended up not only going to college, getting my  PhD, having a successful career in academia. My brother ended up with  a law degree and he   s a successful attorney in North Carolina, and I  think that really does show the power of education.  Right.  And, for some reason, my folks understood that. I had many other  friends that I grew up with who their ambition was to go back and farm,  and most of them didn   t make it. A few of them did, but most of them  didn   t because the hard times came economically and they just couldn   t  keep up.  And I always considered myself very fortunate because of the parents I  had. They were good people, and I considered myself very fortunate to  grow up on a farm. You know, we didn   t have a TV and we didn   t have  a telephone until we moved to town, and I was almost fourteen, fifteen  years old, and so I spent a lot of time outdoors. That   s where I got my  interest in animals. I was always chasing lizards, ground squirrels,  gophers, bats   you name it, I had my hands on it   and I learned to  work. My father made me work and he held me accountable. People will  ask,    Well, where   d you get your best education? Was it at Texas Tech  or A M or the University of Illinois?    And I would say,    No. I got my  best education on Chick Schmidly   s cotton farm. I learned to work. I  learned to be accountable. I learned to be responsible, and I learned to  take care of myself and to not depend on other people, and I learned to  not make excuses for things. My dad was a    no-excuse    person, you  know. He just wouldn   t have it, and so those are traits that have had a lot  to do with my success.  You   re indeed fortunate. It seems like more and more students these  days have to wait until they get to college to either learn those traits  20  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  really quickly or to not be as successful.  Yes, I think society   s a lot different than when I grew up. I didn   t grow  up in the city. I grew up out on a country farm. I rode a school bus.  There wasn   t much opportunity to get in trouble. (Laughs) There wasn   t  much   there wasn   t a TV and there wasn   t a telephone so there wasn   t  much idleness, and if you weren   t in school you worked, or I played  baseball. My dad was a big baseball fan.  Okay.  And there were a lot of kids that lived on the farm in those days, and so  it wasn   t like we didn   t have social interactions because we did. The  farmers built the community house, and the families would go there  once or twice a week. My mother, she prepared most of our own food.  She canned vegetables. We raised gardens. We had livestock. We were  very   we took care of ourselves, and we were raised that way, and we  were raised to work, and I   m very thankful for how I was raised. It   s  carried me well in life.  I know you commented in our first interview some of these same  characteristics you saw as characteristics of our student population here  and a lot of them were raised in rural areas where they were used to  working hard and being on multiple teams and activities and that kind of  thing, so I   m sure that   s helped you to relate so well to those students,  too.  Well, if you talk to a lot of people that hire OSU graduates and you ask  them why, they will tell you,    Character, work ethic and citizenship.     And if you look at these young people on this campus and you get to  know them, you can see that most of them really are that way.  They come out of these little old small Oklahoma towns. They   ve done  everything, you know. They have, ever since they could walk, they were  showing livestock or doing something. They played on teams. They did  all sorts of things, and they have confidence as a result of that, and they  have a great work ethic and they   re good people. They   re just people  you can count on, and they come here and they get a very good  education and so they   re just the kind of people that employers want to  hire because you get not only a well-educated person, but you get a good  person.  One of the things that I didn   t ask you about the last time, as far as our  students go, is how students are ambassadors for the university. I know  that you had formed a President   s Posse while you were here. Could you  talk a little bit about that group and their role, and why you felt that that  was important?  21  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Well, I have learned over the years that most people that come to visit a  campus would rather meet your best students than they would anybody  else. There   s something about being around good young people that is  just   it   s uplifting.  Makes you feel like there   s hope for the future.  Yes it does, and it just makes you feel good. We had done a similar thing  at Texas Tech that was really popular, so instead of having a bunch of  old folks around a suite at a football game, for example, we brought in  our best and brightest students, and so we decided to do the same thing  here. Janet  OSU First Lady Janet Schmidly  actually came up with that  name, the President   s Posse, and we interviewed students. You had to  apply to be in it. It didn   t cost us much. It cost us the price of the t-shirt  or a nice shirt   and then the students would sign up to host important  guests that came on the campus, and I think it was good for the students.  They got to meet a lot of really good people, but it was really a great  way to showcase the quality of Oklahoma State students to our visitors,  and I got so many compliments from visitors that would say,    We  enjoyed the football game, but the highlight was not the victory or not  the game, the highlight was the wonderful students you had in your  suite. They were really good people, and it   s obvious to see why you like  doing what you   re doing.    So it was a very good organization, and it was  good for both students and good for the university.  Now another force that you   ve sort of marshaled while you were here  are the parents of these students through the formation of the Parents  Association, and it really seems like that will be Janet   s legacy here, the  formation of that group. Could you talk a little bit about it?  Well, it was her idea, but I was really anxious to see her do it and  encouraged her because, you know, when we were at Texas A M, the  mother   s clubs   they had the Aggies    Mothers Clubs, and I have never  seen anything like it in my life. I remember one time the governor   Ann  Richards was the governor of Texas   and she did something that the  A M mothers didn   t like, and in one day they wore out three or four fax  machines in the governor   s mansion, and she called Bill Mobley who  was the President   and I knew Bill   and she said,    Bill, I   m changing  my mind. Just get those mothers off my back.    (Laughter) And Bill told  me, he said,    You know, Dave,    he said,    If you ever want anything  done, the group I use the most are the Aggie Mothers,    if I need  something really done and there   s a lot of political clout there.  Right.  So, when Janet said she wanted a parents organization, I thought,    Well,  22  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  you know, that   s going to be good because our parents come from every  county in Oklahoma.    If we can get them signed up and on board, they  can become our ambassadors   and the parents also. They have to pay  enough for their son and daughter   s education now   that they, in my  opinion, have a right to have a little more input.  And the other thing that Janet and I learned through the parents  association at Texas Tech was their input was excellent. They had good  ideas, and so I was really proud of what she was able to get done. It   s  growing. It   s going to continue to grow, and I think, when you look back  on it, that   ll be one of the main legacies of the Schmidly   s at Oklahoma  State and that will be what my wife did to form that Parents Association.  It   s an amazingly vital group for being so young.  It really is, and you know they   ll raise money for scholarships. We were  just talking about this terrible tragedy at Virginia Tech and how to make  sure that nothing like that ever happens here. Janet   s point was,    Well,  you need to get the Parents Association involved instead of the children,  and they should have something to say about what kind of security  systems we have on the campus.    So I just think they   re a good group.  They   re all over the state. They can help the university politically, but  they also can help it by knowing what our students need the most.  We had talked a little bit about faculty and about students as being, and  parents now, as some important constituencies, and I wanted to move on  to athletics. I wanted to first talk a little bit about student athletes   and  one of the things that we had talked about before was the role of student  athletes as ambassadors and specifically the case of Bill Spears   and if  you could talk about that  Well, you know, athletics is   it   s so important in the American public  that it gets a lot of attention nationwide, and if you have a really good  athletic program, then it can create a very positive impression of your  university. You know, some people call it,    The front porch to the  university,    and I think there   s some truth to that in the general public   s  mind. The question is,    Can you do it right?    And doing it right means  more than just winning. It means your student athletes go to class, they  perform well in the classroom, they graduate, they behave and they  become good ambassadors to the university. When all of those things  happen, then the impression the public gets of your university   people  that have never been to Oklahoma   is that Oklahoma is a good place  and Oklahoma State is a good place or it wouldn   t have young men and  women representing it like this. And when it doesn   t happen properly,  like in the case of the University of Colorado where they had that  terrible scandal     23  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Yes.     then it creates a negative perception about a university that   s probably  wrong, and it takes you a lot of money and a lot of time to overcome  that. And we   ve had some great ambassadors as student athletes.  Recently we had a great basketball team that went to the Final Four and  all of its players had graduated by the time they played in the Final  Four   I think that   s true, or all but one had, and that caught the attention  of a person who had graduated from OSU many decades ago but had  sort of lost interest in the university. Bill Spears is who it was, and then  Bill actually contacted us. (Laughs) We had lost   sort of   track of Bill,  and he said, you know,    I want to help you. I was really impressed with  that basketball team and the kind of young men you had on that team.     That got us reacquainted with Bill and it turns out that, while Bill was  sort of brought back to us for that reason, his real interest was academics  because he had been a very good student here, and he had   I think Bill   s  degree was in marketing   and Bill said,    I want to do something to help  you academically,    so he ended up endowing the business school, and  that is a good example of how a good athletic program with good people  in it can help benefit the academic mission of a university.     and that became our first endowed college.  That   s our first endowed college, and Bill to this day remains   he was  just here yesterday   he remains very actively engaged in OSU. He   s up  here every year. He, I think, will do even more for the university in the  future, and he   s going to have the capability to do that.  I think that   s a great story.  It is a great story, and that was a great   not only a great basketball  team   but it was a great group of young men that have gone on to all be  successful in life. They were quality students and quality people and  good players that reflected well on the university.  It seems like during your tenure that you had your share of tragedies,  too, with our student athletes. I think about Vernon Grant and what a  big loss that was not only to the football team but to the student body     and then Timber Eaton, her situation, which didn   t end as a tragedy but  sure looked like it was going to, and Darrent Williams who was an alum,  but also highly visible. What, in your role as President, do you think is  important for the university and the community to hear at a time like that  when there   s that kind of loss?  You never know when there   s going to be loss and you can   t control it.  When there is, I think you have to reflect back on the life involved and if  24  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  you reflect back on Vernon   Vernon was a remarkable human being. I  mean, this kid grew up with almost nothing, and he was a great football  player. He was an even better student. He was over a 3.0 student in  engineering and he just lit the world up. He would come by my office.  He   d come in. He   d give me    five.    He always had this little    doo-rag     on and he looked around my office and he said,    Doctor,    he said,    I   m  going to have an office like this some day.    And that was such an  incredible loss. It was a loss to humanity. It wasn   t just a loss to a  football team. I mean, the human race lost a very special individual, a  guy that was full of optimism. He always had a smile. He worked hard.  He made no excuses, and he was a quality person.  Timber is the same way. We had a different outcome there, thank God.  If you look at what she   s overcome   and that   s one of the great things  about sports, you know, and being around athletes and kids, that they  overcome tragedy. In Vernon   s case, it was unavoidable. He couldn   t,  but you have to   Vernon will always be remembered here. I think Mike  Holder and his wife have endowed a scholarship in Vernon   s name and,  you know, I don   t think a season of football will go by without  somebody reflecting on Vernon and what he meant to Oklahoma State. I  went to Vernon   s funeral, and I   ve been to a lot of difficult funerals in  my life, but I   d never been to one that impacted me more emotionally  than that because I knew Vernon well and I loved him, because he  personified, in my view, exactly what a student athlete is all about     competitiveness, hard work, being just as good in the classroom, being  just as competitive there as he was on the football field, and no excuses,  just hard work and do the best you can in both the classroom and  athletics, and the sad thing is that the world is not going to see the result  of the kind of person that Vernon truly was.  Well, a little bit off of the subject of student athletes, but sort of as a  follow-up in regards to tragedy, what role does a president have in  helping a university cope with a situation like Virginia Tech?  Well, I think you have to be strong, and you have to be the person that  guides the healing process. I   ll tell you a person that did it better than  anyone I   ve ever seen was Jim Halligan here. I was President of Texas  Tech when the plane crash occurred, and Jim   s demeanor, his character,  his general love of people and the way that whole situation was handled  and the aftermath of it, is what a president has to do and so   and I   ve  been impressed with what the president of Virginia Tech has done. You  know, he   s not been in the limelight. That   s not what it   s about, but  being the person that people can talk to, being strong, sending the  message of what the university really stands for and making sure that  parents and loved ones that have suffered through this know that the  university is there for them and always will be there for them. It   s a  25  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  leadership role. It   s a very difficult one. It   s one that a lot of people  aren   t up to. I   ve never had to go through it like Jim Halligan or the  president of Virginia Tech. I hope I never do, but I certainly had a good  teacher in Jim Halligan because I talked with Jim over the phone when it  happened and expressed my condolences and all of us   the other  presidents in the conference   watched how he handled it, and the way  he did it was exemplary to all of us and I think he showed us the way.  Do you think that what happened at Virginia Tech is going to be just  some sort of media blip or do you think that in higher education and on  college campuses that there will be some lasting impact?  Oh, I don   t think there   s any question it   s going to change the landscape  of campuses, and I suspect it will be dramatic, just like Columbine was  for public education. I mean, already some five hundred schools have  signed up with some security company that gives instant messaging, and  then I think you   re going to look at schools evaluating every aspect of  their security.  There   s going to be a lot of discussion about whether people should be  on campus with guns or not. I mean, in Utah now it   s possible   I think  as a result of a Utah law for students that have permission and go  through testing, etc. to be able to carry concealed weapons. There will be  a lot of discussion on how if that law had been in place in Virginia,  would you have had a different outcome? And I don   t know the answer  to that. I   m not a big fan of general weaponry around, but there   s going  to be that conversation. There will be a lot of talk about what   s  happening in society. You know, we continue to see violence being  more and more the outcome of people   s frustration. One could argue that  that   s either a failure of values or a failure of education or a failure of a  lot of things, and I think there may be some actual education efforts that  need to be interjected into the curriculum about how to handle and  manage frustration in ways that don   t require you to use violence. But  this was a very troubled young man. That   s very obvious, and there will  be a lot of discussion about when people see people like this and they  report them to the university. The procedures for how that   s handled are  going to be looked at very closely, and I suspect there will be a lot of  changes. So I expect the impacts to be fairly major.  I think it   s going to be hard to   I   ve been to one college campus that  had what I can call really good control of security in terms of who got on  the campus and who got off, and that was the University of the Americas  in Pueblo, Mexico. They fundamentally had the whole campus perimeter  fenced with about a ten-foot chain link fence and they had guards and  when you came onto the campus, if you were a faculty member, you had  to show your faculty card. If you were a student, you had to show your  26  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  student card, and if you were a visitor, you had to say who you were  going to visit and they called and verified whether you had     Almost like a military base. (Laughs)  It was, and yet that attracted a lot of students because parents that were  sending their students abroad that visited that university   saw the  security and they became very comfortable that their son or daughter  would be     Safe there.     would be very safe there. I   ve never seen that at any U.S. university.  At Texas Tech, we did have little stations and we had the interior of the  campus closed off. You couldn   t drive on it and, you know, if you were  a visitor, you had to get a visitor   s permit and you had to park in a  certain place. We had a little bit of control, but I don   t think it would  have prevented, necessarily, anything like this. I don   t know how you  prevent something like this unless your counselors really pick up on it  and in this case, it   s unfortunate that the state laws weren   t consistent  with the federal laws, and he was able to purchase that weapon     Right.     because clearly he should not have been able to purchase that weapon.  That would have been the main control point, and I think there will be a  lot of conversations about that, too.  It is interesting how much more aware faculty have to be about mental  health issues, and I think they   re seeing a lot more incidences of that.  Well, there are, you know. It   s well documented the number of children  that are coming out of our public schools that are under some sort of  medication for anxiety or depression. It   s higher than   when I came out  of school, I didn   t even know what depression was. I mean, (Laughs) we  didn   t     People didn   t have time to be depressed, did they?  I just, you know, you   ve got anxiety   what   s that mean, you know? It  was just not part of the conversation.  Right.  It   s changed so much. There needs to be some training of faculty about  how to pick up on this and how to work with students because most  27  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  faculty aren   t trained in this area, and if you   re not careful, you can  infringe on people   s rights and you can do things you shouldn   t do.  Well, it   s hard to strike the right balance.  It really is, and normally if you   re expected to do that, you need some  training for it, and that could be one of the outcomes of this is there will  be some mandatory training for faculty to learn how to recognize some  of these symptoms, and training about specifically what to do when you  do recognize it.  Well, turning back to athletics, you talked about one of the most  challenging things that Jim Halligan had to face as president was the  death of these ten individuals who were closely associated with the  university through the men   s basketball team, and I think   again, men   s  basketball proved to be one of the most difficult issues that you had to  face in terms of the situation with Eddie Sutton and the accident that he  had and that whole situation. Can you talk a little bit about that and how  you were able to balance all these competing interests of alumni and  people that loved Eddie Sutton and people that thought that Eddie Sutton  needed to face justice.  Yes, that was very difficult. One of the things you have to understand is  how much I personally like Coach Sutton and admired him. He certainly  has done far more good in his career than he   s ever done bad and that  made this very difficult. The approach though I had to take was one, you  know, that the behavior was such that you can   t condone it, and the  behavior was such that for any employee, you would take very serious  action. I felt that given where the coach was in his career, that the best  thing to do was for him to retire as coach and then just move on and get  his health back, get this problem behind him and reflect back on the  good things about his career. I also felt that was in the best interest of the  university overall, and that it was just not possible for him to return as  coach. That was my perspective given the full set of circumstances and  the standards that we hold all of our employees to, and that was not easy  for Coach Sutton because he   s a man of great pride. He   s a very good  person   a very good person, and it was difficult for him because he was  close to winning his 800th game.  I think there was a side of him that really wanted to come back and  coach again, have a little chance to get well and then step back into that  role, but I just didn   t feel, as leader of the university, we could do that.  At the same time, I did not want to fire Coach Sutton. There was a time  when the university didn   t have a lot going for it, back in the late  eighties, early nineties. It was really struggling   it was struggling to  attract students, and Coach Sutton came back here. He built a basketball  28  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  program that drew national attention. He graduated his players. The  players conducted themselves well. Coach conducted himself very well,  and he brought back a lot of the pride and image and made people feel  good again about Oklahoma State, really good, and I felt like that had to  be respected and that as bad as this situation was, it was not something  that should cause us to just summarily say,    You   re through.    And so  the good thing was we were dealing with a good person, a really good  person, and I felt like, given enough time, that Coach would do the right  thing and he would come to the same conclusion I had, and so we just  gave it time. Now some people were critical that we waited too long, but  I felt Coach had deserved that we wait and be patient and let him reach  his own conclusion, and he did. He reached the conclusion that, you  know,    It   s time for me to turn this thing over to my son and step aside,     and I think that was the best possible outcome for him and for us, for the  university.  It must have been difficult to wait for that outcome.  Well, it was. There was a lot of public pressure. There are always  Monday morning quarterbacks and drunk driving is a big issue these  days. There have been too many innocent people victimized by it and  society has limited, if any, tolerance for it today, and a lot of people that  have been victimized by a driver driving under the influence and  intoxicated, have lost family members, and they don   t have any patience  for this. I can understand that, but my situation   I knew that I was not  going to let him coach again, but I wanted   and I felt like just being  patient, Coach would reach the same decision and that it would be a  better outcome for him and for us, and that   s the way it turned out.  What kind of coaching future do you think Sean  Sutton  has   I mean,  he   s sort of right now living in the shadows   ?  Yes, and that   s tough, really tough. That   s one of the toughest situations  you can put a young coach in. You know, basketball is something I  know a lot about. I played basketball a few years in college. I have  studied it a lot. I   ve been around great coaches   Coach Knight, Coach  Sutton   and I know one thing. Sean knows his X   s and O   s really well.  He   s a good coach. He   s also a good guy, and I think that he needs to  build his own program, though. He   s got to be Sean Sutton, not Sean,  Eddie   s son, and I thought, you know, given the talent and the depth he  had this year, I thought really he had a pretty good season. He got off to  such a great start. The expectations went way up here, and they were  probably way out of line, but he   s had a good recruiting class. I   ve got a  lot of confidence in Sean, but you know it   s a tough profession, and  don   t think for a minute that anybody is going to give him a break  because he   s Eddie   s son. They won   t. There   s nothing more  29  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  competitive than athletics, and it   s not going to be easy for him, but I  sure hope it works out well for him. I   ll be following it closely.  One of the things that I think that has been very commendable about you  is your willingness to give people a second chance. You mentioned Bob  Knight and others here   with JamesOn Curry   could you talk a little bit  about your philosophy about that?  Well, I sort of feel this country was built on that principle, you know. A  lot of the people that came over here and settled were reprobates. They  were run out of Europe (Laughter) and they came over here and they got  a second chance, and people aren   t perfect. I mean, that   s one of the  things you learn   that students make mistakes. I   ve made mistakes in  my life and sometimes you get lucky and they don   t compound as much.  They really compound in athletics because it draws so much public  attention. You look at Coach Knight and, you know, he throws one chair  out of how many years did he coach, and yet every time anybody wants  to focus on him, you see another re-run of that. You don   t see another  re-run of all the great things he did for young men. So I just feel like  when you   re a leader, one of your duties is to be able to judge people  well enough to know when they deserve a second chance, and I felt like  it was a no-brainer hiring Bob Knight. I felt like it was a no-brainer  letting JamesOn Curry, after I met with JamesOn and his mother and  heard JamesOn express in front of his mother how remorseful he was  about the mistake he   s made. I realized, in my opinion, this young man  would be fine, and so those worked out well. It didn   t work out as well  with Prentice Elliot, you know. Coaches wanted to let Prentice have a  second chance, and it didn   t work out. It doesn   t always work out well.  You won   t be perfect, but I think all in all, it   s better to side on giving  people a bit of a break than it is being too harsh and a lot of people just  don   t want the risk. When you give someone a second chance, there   s  some risk, and a lot of people don   t   they   re afraid of risk. Growing up  on a farm, I   m not afraid of risk. I was never     Every day was a risk. (Laughs)  Now I   m smart enough to assess risk, and I am also accountable enough  to know if I make a decision that doesn   t work out right, I   ll be  accountable for it, but I think when you   re afraid to take a risk, you   re in  real danger in terms of being a leader.  Another thing that you had to deal with on the athletic front was the sort  of, I guess, sudden departure of Les Miles who had been a very popular  and successful coach. What is the role of the president in that kind of  situation?  30  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Well, you know, I liked Les a lot   good coach, good guy. He did a great  job here, really a good job here. But I knew, and I think that Les knew,  that he wanted to be on a bigger stage. I had a lot of conversations with  Les about this move, and my feeling in the end   and Coach and I talked  about it   was,    Coach, we want you to stay. We will adjust your  contract a little. We are not going to be able to meet what these people  can pay you because of the size of their football stadium.    And second, I  told him that I would, certainly, understand if he would accept this job  because it was a major step up for him, and we weren   t going to interfere  with that, and I think Les made the right decision and I told him I  thought he did. I wish he would have stayed, but once this opportunity  came his way I don   t think you can blame people for taking an  opportunity that they think will enhance their career. And I felt we were  very fortunate to have Mike Gundy standing by. You know we did a  search, but all along we wanted to hire Mike and we felt like   you  know, Les was hired to come in here, rebuild a program, get it headed in  the right direction, and we knew if he was successful in that, he probably  was going to make another step. He   s a graduate of the University of  Michigan. It wouldn   t surprise me to see him in Michigan some day.  Right.  And it   s like I told him, I said,    The trip to Ann Arbor will be a lot easier  through Baton Rouge than it will be through Stillwater.    The great thing  about Mike Gundy is this is where Mike wants to be. Mike Gundy could  win five national championships in a row here, and he   s a Cowboy. He  loves Stillwater. He loves this university. This is where he wants to be,  and I think that   s what the university now has in its football coach, and I  think Mike   s going to be an exceptional coach, a really good coach.  I guess the one last question I wanted to ask you that was really focused  on athletics is that Harry Birdwell   s departure from the athletic  department wasn   t without controversy maybe because so many people  had worked with Harry in different capacities over the years, but is there  anything that you want to say about that situation?  Well, Harry did a good job as athletic director. You know, he made that  choice himself that he felt like there were other things he wanted to  pursue. I don   t think it   s any secret with a few of our big donors, he  wasn   t hitting it off that well. I think that put a lot of pressure on Harry,  and I think in many ways Harry made the decision he made because he  felt it was in the best interest of the university. Harry loved, and I think  still does   loves Oklahoma State University, and I think in many ways  he saw his role as AD potentially becoming an obstacle and that he had  some other career opportunities and he felt he would pursue those and  give the university a chance to realize the full potential it might if  31  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  someone else were in that role. So I think he made the decision partly  because of his own self-interest, but also because of his belief it was in  the best interest of the university. But if you look back at Harry   s record  as athletic director, I mean, he hired good coaches. He certainly had a lot  of enthusiasm for OSU. The coaches that worked for him liked him a lot.  Student athletes liked him, and he did a good job.  Well, this is a totally different theme. I wanted to talk to you about OSU  as a multi-campus system and the fact that your title since you   ve been  here has been President and CEO of the OSU system. During your  tenure here, OSU-Tulsa has really grown, and they have the    20 by 20     slogan of having twenty thousand students by the year 2020. It seems  like maybe that   s overly optimistic     Oh, yes. I said that when I first got here. You get a little catchy phrase  and people gravitate to it, but all you have to do is look at the  demography of Oklahoma and realize that   s not going to happen. The  number of the projected high school graduation rate and the people  going to college is flat to slowly declining in Oklahoma. So early on I  told the leaders down there that I thought we ought to get away from that  and that we ought to readjust those predictions, and we did. But OSU-Tulsa  is doing very well. It is growing in the areas it should grow. It  doesn   t need to grow to twenty thousand students to have a big impact  on Oklahoma. What it does need to do is bring some graduate  programs   some public graduate education programs   into the  community of Tulsa and some research programs into Tulsa, and so  when we put together the package of money to build the Helmerich  Advanced Technology Center, that is going, in my opinion, to be a huge  difference-maker for OSU-Tulsa and the state because you   re going to  have graduate engineering education   public graduate engineering  education   and you   re going to have major high-tech research programs  in Tulsa in that facility, and that will add a lot to the economy and  economic development in that community.  I felt, when I came here that the system was the strongest asset that the  institution had. That this idea of a   one university, multiple campuses,  working under the same strategic plan, heading toward the same goals  and disbursed the way it was, just had a huge upside for Oklahoma and  the ability of Oklahoma State to make a difference in the state, and if  you draw an oval around those campuses, that   s eighty percent of the  people in Oklahoma. So when we did our strategic plan, we really  focused on that and we focused on talking about this one university,  multiple campuses, with technology education, four-year / two-year  technology education, medical education, and the graduate education  and undergraduate education here and in Tulsa, and I think that   s been  one of the success stories we   ve had.  32  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  All of those campuses are doing very well. Okmulgee is   we   ve added  four-year technology degrees. We just added a four-year degree in  Oklahoma City. That   s, I think, still one of the fastest growing campuses  in the state. Our medical school in Tulsa is doing better than it ever has  in its history, and now with graduate education and research going onto  the Tulsa campus, we have all of the pieces in place. Very importantly,  we   re adding two more sites to the OSU directory, one in Ponca City  with a major research effort on sensors and one in Ardmore in a  partnership with the Noble Foundation to focus on biofuels and plant  biotechnology and agro-biotechnology, and that will further spread  geographically Oklahoma State, and that   s important for a land grant  university. Land grant universities are about helping all the people in the  state, not just one location, so OSU has an office in every county in  Oklahoma. Now it   s got these   what, six, seven locations where it will  be doing education research and public service, and you put all of that  together, that   s going to have a huge impact in this state.  Well, I think it is a huge asset when you were thinking about undertaking  a statewide project and you realize that you already have this presence  in every county in the state.  That   s right.  That   s a lot of barriers that you don   t have to break through.  Well, you know we did that economic study on the economic impact of  OSU in Oklahoma, and it was  2.9 billion impact and that   s because, in  part, it   s not just in one location. It has these multiple locations. I think  that   s a great asset the university has.  Now I have a few questions that I guess are more personal     Okay.     although not overly personal. Of all the presidents who have been  here, I think that it   s not an exaggeration to say that you   re the one that  has had the most active research agenda. You   ve taught. You   ve advised  graduate students. You   ve continued to publish. You   ve lectured. How  do you balance all that, and why has it been so important to you to  maintain that research agenda?  Well, the heart and soul of a university is scholarship, and if you   re  going to lead it, you need to be engaged in scholarship. That   s my  opinion. It   s just something that   s always been very personal for me. I  did not get a PhD to become a university president. In fact, I had no  ambition of ever becoming a university president. It just sort of  33  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  happened. I got a PhD because I wanted to be a scholar, and I made my  mind up that I was never going to get away from that. I love teaching  and I love working with students. I mean, why would you work at a  university if you didn   t like that? But I also decided early on when I got  into administration, that I would become known for being a university  administrator still engaged in scholarship. I couldn   t be as engaged as I  was when I was a faculty member, but I have always maintained that  engagement at every university I   ve been and I will be doing it at the  University of New Mexico as well. It   s just part of me. It takes a few  more hours. You know, a lot of those hours I   m up till 12:00, 1:00 in the  morning working on a presentation or reading a student   s dissertation or  thesis. Yes, I could be sleeping or doing other things, but I don   t think  I   d be as effective as I   ve been if I didn   t do that, and so it   s just very  personal to me. It   s very important, and it   s just part of my style of  leadership as a university president. I   m going to be a scholar, and  hopefully the faculty look up to me for it and the students do as well.  You mentioned that you didn   t get a PhD to become a university  president   that just sort of happened. So tell me how that did happen.  (Laughs) I had no interest in administration. I was really doing well as a  faculty member at Texas A M. I was publishing. I had a lot of graduate  students. I had several research projects. I had a great undergraduate  teaching load. I loved the department I was in. It was perfect, and we  had gone through some leadership challenges in the department and I  had been asked to step in as interim department head, and I did and I sort  of rallied the troops and we made a dramatic improvement, and then  they asked me to stay as permanent department head and I enjoyed that  leadership. I really did, and so I did that and I said, you know, I   ll stay  for five years and that   s it. I   ve never stayed in any leadership role for  longer than five years. And, sure enough, in the fifth year A M had a  little campus that had been a separate stand-alone university in  Galveston called Texas A M at Galveston     Okay.     and they made a decision they were going to merge that back with the  main campus in College Station, and I had helped develop some  programs down there studying marine mammals and marine  conservation science. Because I knew the campus, A M asked me to go  down there and manage the merger of that campus back with the main  campus. And that was the greatest learning environment I ever had  because that little old campus had one of everything. It had dormitories.  It had a library. It had   you know, it had everything a big university  had, but it didn   t have a lot of people to run it. I had to learn how to do  the auxiliaries, how to do (Laughs) the library, the buildings, the  34  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  grounds. I mean, I got a tremendous experience there in how to run a  campus on a small scale, but covering everything, and I loved it. I stayed  my four and a half, almost five, years there, and my alma mater called  and they wanted me to come back and help them grow research and  graduate education. They felt like they had lost a little traction there     this was Texas Tech   and I did that. And there I worked for probably  the best two bosses I ever had   Don Harrigan and John Montford. I  learned a lot from them. I really enjoyed working for Harrigan. He was a  first-rate individual, great administrator. And Don, all of a sudden  though, decided that he didn   t want to be president anymore. And I   ll  never forget one day he said,    Dave, you ought to apply for this. You   d  be perfect for your alma mater.    And I thought about it   decided I   d do  it, and I was fortunate enough to be selected and the rest is history. So  I   ve been pretty fortunate. I   ve done three   will have done three  university presidencies in one career.  Yes, that   s pretty amazing.  Well, you could say it   s amazing. You could say it was foolish, too.  (Laughter) They   re not easy.  No, I can   t imagine.  But I   ve enjoyed   certainly I   ve enjoyed the first two. I hope I enjoy the  third one.  How do you get fired up to do it for the third time?  It   s the challenge. The University of New Mexico really is intriguing to  me because it   s a university with a very strong research profile. It does  almost  300 million a year in outside grants and contracts, making it one  of the largest public research universities in the country, but it   s never  been able to translate that success over into its graduation success. It has  a graduation rate of under fifty percent.  Wow.  And so it   s a challenge. How do you go in and   obviously, it has a good  faculty. What is wrong? What is happening there so these students are  not succeeding? That to me is a real challenge and it really intrigues me  and that   s why I think I can tackle it and I   m really fired up about it. I   ve  got some unique ideas that are sort of out of the box for higher  education, and it   s a chance also, of course, to move to a place where  we   re ultimately going to retire and where our son lives, and hopefully  we can reunite our whole family there. I think it   ll be a good place to  end my career. And I   ll work there five years and retire.  35  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  So what   s magical about five years?  Well, I had a good friend once that was an administrator, and he told me,  he said,    Dave, nobody should stay in an administrative role longer than  five years.    I said,    Why?    and he said,    Well, you kind of wear  yourself out. Five years   you   ve used up most of your good ideas,    and  he said,    If you   re doing your job, you   ve worn out most of the people  around you, too, and it   s time   and leadership changes are not all that  bad.    And I   ve thought about that and I   ve watched people stay in  leadership roles too long, and it just sort of becomes the thing to do, you  know. I   ve watched a lot of college presidents play golf three days a  week and they just stay and they stay and they stay and things just roll  on and roll on and roll on, and I just don   t have any interest in that. I   m  more interested in the challenge, tackling the tough issues, getting it  going, and then I   m ready to go to another challenge. That   s just the way  I am.  Well, you sit on several boards   on the NASULGC  National  Association for State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges  board, on  the executive committees of the International Association of University  Presidents, too. Why has it been important for you personally to be  involved in organizations like this, and why do you think it   s important  for OSU to stay involved?  Well, I think it creates visibility, but the most important thing you get is  you   re around the people that are the leaders in the field and you learn  about new innovative things. You learn about best practices that work at  other places and you begin to see ways that you might implement them  and improve your own institution. So I   m a big believer in getting  involved in leadership organizations. The international education in this  global economy is becoming more and more important, and I   m going to  stay on that board and I   m going to stay on the board of the Association  of Governing Boards of Higher Education. And those, I mean, I meet  other presidents that are really good. They talk about things they   re  doing on their campuses and little light bulbs go off and say,    Hey, you  know, we could do that. That would make us better.    And I think you  get a lot of good practices as a result of that kind of interaction.  It seems almost improbable to me that between being a university  president and having a research agenda and wanting to spend at least  some time with your family, do you have any other outside interests or  things that you   ve put on hold that you want to pursue once you   re  retired or     No, not really. You know, I   ve always worked, ever since I was,    knee  high to a grasshopper.    When I retire, I want to get back and do more  36  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  mammalogy.  Get back into the field?  Yes, back into natural history work and the stuff that I really enjoy. It   s  interesting, the older I become the more I read. I read now more than  any time in my entire life, and I just absolutely love it. I cannot go  without reading all the time. I want to continue. I want to do more  reading. I don   t know what   s driven me in this direction. I   ve become  fascinated by history, just fascinated by it, almost to the point where I  will probably give some thought   maybe going back and getting  another PhD after I retire.  Really?  Yes.  Wow   I mean, lifelong learning, I think, is important and I would love to   I   d  like to get a PhD in history or the philosophy of science and do another  dissertation just for the heck of it, you know   just to keep me occupied.  I won   t be able to sit around. I   m not a golfer. I do like to hunt and fish. I  like to get outdoors. I like to be around my grandkids. Janet and I like to  travel. We very much like traveling, and we like to travel in cars and go  to out-of-the-way places, and there will be a time in our lives where, you  know   we   ve always wanted to do a safari in Africa. We   ve wanted to  go to Australia. I want to go to the Galapagos Islands and see what  Darwin saw. And so we will do some things like that, and then I   ll keep  doing my mammalogy, keep reading, and maybe do another degree. I  don   t know   hopefully if my health stays good.  I remember the very first time that I heard you speak on this campus.  You talked about a study that you had just completed. In fact, your book  had just come out where you had looked at the biological inventory of  Texas and you had gone back to those places a hundred years later and  photographed, you know   I guess you had photographs of what they  were like at the time     Yes.     and then photographs in the intervening hundred years, and does a  project like that appeal to you again?  Well, in fact, that   s interesting you would say that. That   s going to be  my project in New Mexico.  37  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Oh, okay.  There was a similar biological survey of New Mexico done by the same  guy who     Oh, that did the Texas one?     did the Texas one   Vernon Bailey. Only his wife, Florence Bailey,  who was a very accomplished ornithologist   she did the birds in New  Mexico and Bailey did the mammals in New Mexico, and this work was  done between about 1910 and 1930. All of their field notes, their  documentation and their old photographs are at the National  Photographic Archives in Washington. Now, I don   t know New Mexico.  I knew Texas like the back of my hand. I   d been in all 254 counties in  Texas.  That   s quite an accomplishment. (Laughs)  It is. There aren   t many people alive that can say that     I don   t think so. (Laughs)     by the way, probably not even the governor of Texas. But I could  literally look at a photograph in Texas and tell you within ten miles from  where it was taken. I can   t do that in New Mexico, so I   ve got to get  familiar with the geography, but one of my goals is to write something  about how the natural history of New Mexico has changed and to  compare it with the change I saw in Texas. Texas is a private land state  with a very large population and a completely different dynamic than  New Mexico.  Which has a lot of public lands.  New Mexico is a public land state with a very small population, and so  by doing these two, I think it would give me some insights into how land  ownership and population size impacts conservation issues, and so  hopefully I   ll be able to do a book on New Mexico like I did on Texas.  By the way, I was going to try to do something like that in Oklahoma,  too, because there are   when Oklahoma was a territory, there was quite  a bit of biological work done here.  I   ve heard that Oklahoma has the third greatest ecological diversity of  all of the fifty states in terms of   maybe that   s not true, but in terms of  the areas going from the panhandle all the way into southeastern  Oklahoma.  38  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  I don   t know if it would be third. It would probably be in the top dozen,  and the reason is because of its location in the center of the United  States. You get some eastern species that come across the Mississippi  and the southeast, and they come into southeastern Oklahoma. You get  the northern Great Plains species that come through the center. Then you  get the southwestern species that come from Mexico and western Texas,  and then you get the northern Rockies species, and then you get some  southern elements that come out of the tropics. They all sort of blend in  Oklahoma, and so it does have a rich fauna and flora, but it   s not as rich  as it is in New Mexico where you get the mountains and the topographic  relief     That   s true.     or Arizona or Utah or Texas or California. So I don   t think it would be  number three. But it would be certainly higher than Mississippi and  Louisiana, Alabama, the southeastern states and most of the eastern  states.  Well, I hope you can do that project and     I will do that project.     the comparative aspect of it sounds really interesting. Well, let me talk  to you a little bit about leadership. I know that I   ve heard you use the  expression,    Getting the right people on the bus,    which I don   t think is  your expression, but        Headed in the right direction.        Headed in the right direction      the other key part of that   how did  you go about building your team here?  Oh, well   about like I have at every place I   ve been. I like to have a few  veterans   people that know where all the skeletons are, what   s been  tried in the past, what   s worked, what hasn   t worked, and I like to have a  mixture of new people that come in with new ideas that don   t care about  what happened in the past. Above all, I like for my people to want to be  on a team, to care more about the good of the organization than their  own personal role in it, and I think we   ve done a really good job of  building a team here. In fact, I would say you could make a pretty good  case that maybe the most important thing I did here was build that kind  of team. I had some veterans that had been at it a long time   Dave  Bosserman, Lee Bird, Steve McKeever   very good people, excellent,  good administrative skills, buying into the teamwork idea and I really  enjoy being part of the team.  39  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  The presidents of the other branches were all that way, except we needed  new leadership at the medical school. We brought in John Fernandes  there. And then I sort of rounded the team out by bringing in maybe my  most important hire   I would say two of them would have been Marlene   Strathe , who   s now the acting or interim president. She is a marvelous  Provost. I just can   t imagine you could find a better one anywhere in the  country, and she did a great job here of working with faculty and  working with the other vice presidents. All of them reported to me, but  they all had a dotted line through Marlene and I used an old Winston  Churchill saying about Marlene. I said,    She was first among equals.     (Laughter) And she was great. And the other person that was really great  was General Al Goodbary who came in as Chief of Staff. When you try  to run five campuses, as multi-dimensional as these are, and you   ve got  all the things going on, on this campus, you really have to have a  talented integrator, and Al is one of the most talented and best organized  people I   ve ever been around and just genuinely good. Al doesn   t have  an evil bone in his body. He   s not out to get anybody. All he wants is  good things for his alma mater, and he was a key lynchpin in all this by  keeping everybody well informed, well communicated with, and we  would have never been able to accomplish what we have without the  General.  I had some that didn   t work out. Two guys I had the highest hopes for     things didn   t work out for them. I brought them from Texas Tech. I  don   t think   in hindsight, I probably shouldn   t have done that. One of  them was health reasons and the other got caught in a campus political  trap, and those things happen. I don   t think I did them a good service,  and if I had that to do all over again I probably wouldn   t have brought  them along with me. But you live and learn.  Right.  But all in all, it   s been a good team and a group of people that have  worked well together, worked for the same goals and it had this mixture  that   s so important, of veteran people and new people with new ideas  willing to work together, and I think that   s the key.  And so you   re going through that whole process again of building that  right team. (Laughs)  I am, and it   s interesting out there. The University of New Mexico is a  minority majority population of students. If you total up its Hispanic and  Native American student population, it   s probably close to fifty percent  of the students.  Interesting.  40  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  But the administration is all white males (Laughs) right now, so I have  to     Try to play with that mix a little bit?  Yes, I do. I have to diversify the leadership team there, and we   ll do that.  There will be some people that stay and then we   ll have to bring in some  people from the outside.  In our first interview, you talked about the four biggest issues facing  higher education today were access, affordability, excellence and  student success. Do you think those are going to continue to be the most  important issues in the next five or twenty years?  Yes, I think they will, especially in states like Oklahoma and New  Mexico where you have a low per-capita income and you   re trying to  raise the state economically and you look at your institutions of higher  education, you   ve got to get more people into the higher education  system and you   ve got to be more efficient and graduate them, but  you   ve also got to keep them in the state. It doesn   t do much good to get  them in here, spend Oklahoma taxpayer dollars to educate them and then  export them to Texas. And to do that, it has to be affordable. And if  you   re going to create those jobs, you have to have excellence in your  research programs to bring high-tech companies in that will hire them.  Where you have low per-capita incomes and a small percentage of  college graduates, public education tends to under-perform and so you  really have to focus on student success. It   s no victory at all to get a  student to go to college if they flunk and drop out. That   s a waste of  money. I don   t know that in states like California or Maryland that it  will necessarily be those four things, but I can tell you in smaller states  with low per-capita income and not a lot of population growth, those are  going to be the issues.  I wanted to move on and ask you, I think, two questions that I think are a  little bit self-serving, but I think if any of my colleagues look at this  interview later on they   ll be really disappointed if I don   t ask you...  Right.  I   ve heard a lot of university presidents call the library,    the heart of the  university.    In your opinion, what is the role of the university library  today in this digital age?  It   s the intellectual center of the whole place. I mean, I can   t imagine  that everyone associated with Oklahoma State is not coming through this  41  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  library. It   s where the knowledge is and increasingly   you know, I love  books, so you   re talking to a person that maintains my own personal  library. I never sell a book that I buy. I   m just a    book-hound,    okay?  So, I love libraries, and I like to see students use them. I like to see them  use the books. I don   t like to see them go online because I   ve learned  enough in my profession what   s online is not always right, and I don   t  think we   re doing enough to get students into our libraries to use the  books. I don   t think that   s going to change. I really don   t, even with all  this digital stuff. I think people are going to swing away from some of  that. Now, some of it   s good. You can get all your journals digitally.  That   s not a bad thing, okay? But there   s still no substitute, in my  opinion, for having a student come over here and dig through a stack of  journals, find five articles, sit down and read them, and try to make  sense out of what they mean instead of going online and in thirty  minutes trying to get someone else   s opinion about what they mean. I  think that   s not good. That   s not education, in my opinion. That   s just  searching for information. It   s not thinking.  I think we agree with you, to some extent, where you are dependent on  the kinds of assignments that faculty gives their students and what they  deem as being acceptable research.  You know, I taught a leadership class this year and asked my students to  write a little blurb on Ed Wilson as a leader. You know, we had him  come and speak     Right.      and I have to say I was disappointed because we had them do it all  electronically and then we could run them through one of these little  services, and we found that a lot of it was just lifted out of material off  the internet, and I asked some students to do some additional stuff that I  felt had gone too far in that direction. I talked to them about it and I  don   t think any of them did it. I think they really thought that   s the way  you     Went about doing something        went about doing something and I tried to point out to them that, it   s  really not. What I had hoped you   d do was get some of his books, look  at them, maybe even read one, and you tell me what you thought of him  as a leader, not what you read somebody else thought of him. And I  think that that   s one of the challenges that we   ve got in education now. I  loved it when I was an undergraduate student. There was one Xerox  machine on the Texas Tech campus. (Laughter) It was in the library. It  cost you ten cents a copy.  42  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Wow. That   s more than it costs now. (Laughs)  I know. (Laughter) And it made these crusty old copies, and it took  forever, and so nobody used it. I went to the library every night to study.  I went into the stacks and I got journals out and I read them and I made  notes on them and I compared this one to that one and I learned how to  put the information base together and interpret what it means. I don   t  think anything that technology has created can replace that, and there   s a  certain discipline in your mind that comes from doing that, and if all you  do is get on some gadget and just start accumulating stuff and strip it out  and stick it together and call it a paper, it   s not a paper. It   s something  you   it   s just a piece of information you collated. A paper should have  some scholarship in it, and the scholarship is your interpretation, your  thoughts.  Some original thinking.  And that   s what we don   t have enough of in higher education. And only  the faculty can bring it back. A university president can   t do that.  Moving on to something really practical as far as libraries go   you  know, everybody on this campus wants a bigger piece of the pie, so what  advice do you have, if any, about how libraries can get a bigger piece of  the university pie?  Well, I think you have to   the pie is going to have to come more from  the private sector. There   s always going to be a certain amount of public  money for libraries, and as well there should be, but public funds  anymore are not sufficient to sustain everything that a library needs, and  I think that Oklahoma State, like any other university, is going to have to  place the library at a fairly high level in its fundraising priorities and it   s  going to have to cultivate more Boone Pickens      you know, people that  understand that if you really want to help the academic mission,  probably overall the best gift you can make is to the library. Before long  OSU has got to enlarge this library and it   s going to have to raise some  private money to do that, and that   s, I think, something that all libraries  have got to do more of, is they   ve got to get better at fundraising.  We   ve been appreciative of some of the gifts that you   ve steered in our  direction that were people that weren   t on our radar screen, but that you  had contact with. I think about the Clerico gift for the renovation of the  plaza and     We had to do that.  Yes.  43  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  That plaza was in terrible shape and you can   t   you just can   t have the  library   the front door of the library   looking like that, but I think you  made a friend in John, and he has more giving capacity, and I think  Boone   you know, Boone loves books.  Yes.  He really does, and I think that Boone is someone that the library should  definitely cultivate and the Helmerich   s. Many good friends of OSU  understand the importance of this library to its mission, and I think you  can get help.  Let me ask you two concluding questions. One is that we   ve covered a  lot of different topics. Is there anything that you wish that I had asked  you about that I didn   t?  Well, are you going to ask me what I think about the future of OSU and,  you know, what I think worked and what I think didn   t?  Yes. That was kind of my concluding question.  Then if that   s the case, then you   ve covered, I think, a pretty good  spectrum of what we could possibly talk about     Okay.     without getting down to individuals     Right.     which I really don   t have any interest in doing.  And I don   t have any interest in doing that either, but I am interested in  what you, now with approaching twenty-twenty hindsight, what did work  well here? What didn   t? And what do you think the future holds for this  institution?  Well, the future, I think, will hold good things, but the institution has  still got to focus on getting more competitive with its sister institution,  particularly in the fundraising area. And I look back on my time here,  and I enjoyed every single second of it. And I really, really came to love  this place, as Jim Halligan predicted I would. And I think the reason is  the people. There are very good people associated with Oklahoma  State   its students, its faculty, its staff, its alums, its supporters are all  good people. Oklahoma   s a great state. It may not be the wealthiest state,  but it   s filled with big-hearted people, and I liked living in Oklahoma a  44  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  lot. And looking back over the university, I think there are some things  that it   s got to be watchful of. One is that athletics cannot become the  tail wagging the dog. That   s the biggest challenge that I see in the future.  It   s got its own foundation now. Soon it will have more money than the  university foundation. How it   s managed and the fact that it becomes  managed as a part of the university and not the driving force of the  university will be crucial to the future of the university. Otherwise, it   s  just going to be a big-name athletic program dragging an academic  program behind it, and that never works. It might work for a short time,  but you won   t sustain excellence in the athletic program if you don   t  improve the academic mission. The two really go hand in hand. And so I  think the university has really got to watch that. And the biggest   you  know, the university has a great board, at least while I worked on it, but  it rotates its leadership every year and I think that   s a real weakness.  Is that not typical?  No.  Oh, okay.  It   s not typical for any board I   ve ever seen. I think that you need  leadership on a board just like you need leadership at an institution, and  most universities that I know of   you know, they have board chairmen  that stay for a period of years. These are people that are rich in wisdom  and leadership. They often have money. They direct support to the  institution, and you create a consistency of leadership at the board level  that matches the consistency of leadership at the institutional level. I  know we had that at Texas Tech with Ed Whitaker, the CEO of AT T  then SBC.  Okay, that   s where I   ve heard that name.  And you saw it at the University of Oklahoma with Christy Everest, but  here the chairmanship rotates every year and, while they   re all   they   re  wonderful people, I think all in all, it does not create enough of a  consistency of leadership and it makes for a challenge, and it puts a lot  of the power in the hand of the executive director of the board and I  don   t think that   s where you really want the leadership to reside.  The other challenge is the foundation and the university has got to be  closer together. I mean, I   m going to a university where we   ll start a  capital campaign. There, the head of the foundation is a vice-president  that reports to the university. The separateness of the foundation is the  management of the funds     45  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Paustenbaugh  Schmidly  Right.     but the leadership is through the university, and I think you have to  realize, too, that there   s not a lot of money in Stillwater and the money  that   s going to be raised in the future for Oklahoma State is going to  have to be raised outside of Stillwater. I think there is going to have to  be a fresh look at some things at the foundation   where you put  development officers, how you manage all of that, which contributes to  this fundraising effort because the University of Oklahoma is far out-raising  us fund-wise, and we can   t have that continue. And if I had it to  do over again, I would have done more to address some of those issues.  But all in all, I look back on my time here   I loved it. I loved the people  I worked with. I liked every aspect of it. I liked the board and I will  leave here with nothing but good thoughts about Oklahoma State and its  people.  And how do you want to be remembered?  Oh, I just want to be remembered as a guy that came in and I did my  best, you know. I tried to create a vision, a plan. I tried to get people  unified around it, and I worked as hard as I conceivably could to achieve  that, and the proof will be in the pudding over time, and we   ll see.  Hopefully, it will taste good for awhile.  Well, thank you so much.  Thank you. I enjoyed it. It was fun.  -------  -------
