Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for the HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Scott Stearns.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is Elma Ina Lewis, E-L-M-A, second name, I-N-A, surname, L-E-W-I-S.
Speaker 1: And ma'am what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Boston [Massachusetts], actually in the Roxbury community, on September 15, 1921.
Speaker 1: And Ma'am what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Well, my occupations are varied.  I would call myself the Artistic Director of the National Center of Afro-American Artists, which was founded in 1968, and grew out of a conference in Chicago [Illinois] of black artists who were gathered together by an assemblage of what--I would call them history makers, in New York [New York City, New York].  The conference was at Columbia College in Chicago [Columbia College Chicago], where Gwendolyn Brooks was then a professor.
Speaker 1: This conference was in 1968?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: A group of black artists gathered there and decided we needed a national platform.  Since the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts Incorporated had just acquired some property from the Boston Jewish community, it seemed logical that we establish a national voice in Boston, because we were the only ones with significant property.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts had been founded in 1950, and occupied four sites, from '50 [1950] to '68 [1968] by rental, or other people's largess, and was seeking a permanent home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Hence the national center.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what is today's date?
Speaker 2: This is April 10, 2003.
Speaker 1: Yes, and where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: At the present time, I'm working out of my home.  The only physical property we have left is the Museum of the National Center of Afro-American Artists.  And it is in the embryonic stage, and is very, extremely beautiful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But we're in your home right now?
Speaker 2: Yes.

Speaker 1: Before we go into depth with this interview,
Speaker 2: (unclear)
Speaker 1: There are five People magazine-ish type questions we always ask, and they just require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first question is Ma'am what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite?
Speaker 1: Food.
Speaker 2: Food?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: That's hard for me to say.  I am a protein eater, I'll say that.  Chicken, fish, lamb, all those foods.  I'm a protein eater.  I'm more interested in preparation than the food.  I am... probably sweets, which I wasn't until I gave up all alcohol.  Now I need it in sugar, I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it's hard for me to say a favorite food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Red.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: I supposed Autumn is my--I think the starting of it interests me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The best thing I've seen so far is South Africa.  And I say so far because I'm still eligible for new sights.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know.  I say this often.  Last week a young girl laughed for an hour when I said "for crying in the sink."  She said she never heard anybody say that.  People say, "Well crying out loud."  I'm exasperated all the time. "For crying in the sink."  It takes a lot of water to fill the sink.
Story_ID: 111555
Speaker 1: I'll--I'd like to ask you about your family origins.  Now can you, how far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: Well, knowledgeably, the grandparents, but through maybe another generation.  But I had a spectacular upbringing.  If I were John D. Rockefeller's child, it couldn't have been better.  In fact, it wouldn't have been as good, because I wouldn't have known the other side of the coin.  But my father and mother were not university people.  They were common laborers.  My mother [Edwardine Jordan Corbin Lewis] came from one end, which probably this would have been the elegant class.  And my father [Clairmont Richard McDonald Lewis] came from the working class.  They did not know each other there.
Speaker 1: Now, tell me, did you hear stories passed down from your grandparents or your parents about what life was like, you know--
Speaker 2: You almost can't avoid that.
Speaker 1: --in the nineteenth century, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: You almost can't avoid that.  That's not peculiar to me, it's not peculiar to black people.  That is the way the culture has ended, and what remains of the culture.  Culture is not art.  Art is a means of expressing the culture.  When you see a picture called "The Grateful Poor," that tells you about our old grandfather.  (unclear) Eating almost nothing, but they're worshipping God for that little bit.  And the same things... I had traditions.  My mother used to speak about going to Belleplaine [Barbados] on the five o'clock train.  When I first went to Barbados, I remembered my mother dangling me and jumping me on her lap chanting, "Now I'm going to Belleplaine on the five o'clock train."  And Belleplaine was very real to me.  We ate foods that she brought to this country.  We ate cornmeal and okra stirred together which is Cou Cou.  Nobody does that but the Barbadians.  I heard about flying fish.  Fish fly in Barbados and they fly in India.  I have some flying fish in my freezer right now that one of my New York cousins brought back from Barbados frozen when she went to a funeral.  I had special--I said, I don't know, my father says I was especially aware.  Maybe I was more accurate than most little children.  But I think all children hear those stories.  My father, I went to Barbados just after he died, for the first time.  And forty-two relatives met me at the plane, of his bloodline.  When I saw where he was born, it was a shack on top of a coral reef in Christ Church [Barbados].  It was virtually untouched since he'd been born.  And his nieces and nephews were still living there.  So yes, I have a great memory of tradition.
Story_ID: 111556
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us, give us your father's name and spell it for us, and his date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His name was Clairmont McDonald--I'm sorry--Clairmont Richard McDonald Lewis.  There are some things that you bring from the slavemaster.  It's an English tradition to name all those children all of the names of the family.  His father was Richard McDonald Lewis.  They added Clairmont to his name, Clairmont Richard McDonald Lewis.  He came to America in 19--.  Now I would have to look at the documents, because I no longer keep exact dates in my mind that are of the essence.  But I have his passport and the whole thing, so I can look at them and find out.
Speaker 1: So, you're not sure exactly when he was born?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say he was born in 1898, but I'm not sure, I would think so.  He was twenty-four when I was born, so it's not too hard to figure that out.  I have his passport and his work documents, and all kinds of things.  But I don't waste a lot of time wondering exactly when he was born.
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 2: He was a profound man.
Speaker 1: Yes, so tell us about him.
Speaker 2: And if he had been university-educated, he would have been a terror.  He could do upper calculus in his brain.  Every single Sunday he went to hear a lecture.  He no longer belonged to the Anglican church in which he was raised.  He belonged to something called the Community Church, which was more or less of a philosophic movement.  He went every weekend to a concert of Roland Hayes, Marion Anderson, Boston Symphony--black concerts because all black people played all that music too.  We're inclined now to believe now that they did the blues and jazz, which is our personal music, but we were also masters of European music.  He never considered himself educated, but his children were.  Not his children, I was his only child.  My brothers were his stepsons, but they were as children.  He always considered himself not wanting to feel that what we were doing was because the university told us.  But he was not at all reticent in thinking that he knew more.  He had a saying, "I am a man.  And nothing that which is common to men is not foreign to me."  That engulfed everybody from David Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and before.  He was a man, (unclear) and nothing which was common to men was foreign to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a building superintendent.  And all his life, he was frustrated and angry.
Story_ID: 111557
Speaker 1: My mother [Edwardine Jordan Corbin Lewis], who had been brought up to think that sewing, embroidering, and being aristocratic was the way girls went, found herself doing housework in America.  They didn't have vacuum cleaners, they-- you scrubbed the floors on your hands and knees.  She was very lovely to look at, and her knees were terrible to see.  And she would show us her knees all the time say, "Do you see these knees?  I'm kneeling on them now, so you won't kneel on yours later."  I still think of that if I miss an opportunity.  The sacrifices they made for us should not be ignored.  Young blacks don't know that today, because they don't carry the tradition the way the older ones did.  But they made us know everything they were doing for us, against their natural inclination.  It never occurred to us that they were doing that because they wanted to.  That was all that was available, and we were of the essence that we must move on.  I was also not brought up to believe that a good job was what I should do.  I should do what?  Enhance the position of blacks.  Not in America, in the world.  And that remains with me until now.
Speaker 2: Now, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: She was born Edwardine Jordan, Edward-I-N-E, Edwardine Jordan.  She married Athelston Corbin.  Within four years of their marriage, this young man had typhoid and died.  She was living with him in Trinidad where her two sons were born, my brothers, Darnley Leon Corbin and George Clarence Corbin.
Speaker 2: C-O-R-B-E-T-T, Corbett?
Speaker 1: Corbin.
Speaker 2: Okay, Corbin, C-O-R-B-I-N?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And she went home to her father's house in Barbados and was supposed, by her tradition, to live out her young life in genteel poverty.  But she wanted to come to America and work her fortune.  And her father [James Jordan] gave her fifty dollars and her passage, which was a great stress.  And they came, she came to America with a younger cousin to a third second cousin, and that's how she was established.  She met my father [Clairmont Richard McDonald Lewis] at that house, and the rest is history.
Story_ID: 111558
Speaker 1: So, she [Edwardines Jordan Corbin Lewis] met your father [Clairmont Richard McDonald Lewis] in America?
Speaker 2: In America.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And they were both from Barbados?
Speaker 2: When immigrants come to a new country, they tend to congregate in communities of their ethnicity.  So, there was a large West Indian community, large for Boston.  There was in New York [New York City, New York]; there was up and down the Eastern seaboard.  And you fed into that much the way the Italians do, that's the Jews do.  That's the way any ethnic does, and still does.  Today we have Haitian communities and Spanish communities, etc.  They come, each with the other, and establish themselves.
Speaker 1: Now, your parents were involved with the Universal Negro Improvement Association, right?
Speaker 2: My father said as a child at home, he knew that the British were abusing and abusive.  He knew about Booker T. Washington, and his ambition was to come here and join Booker Washington.  When we got here, Booker Washington was not his cup of tea, and he heard of a young man from Jamaica whose name was Marcus Garvey.  That appealed to him, and he and my mother were staunch Garvey-ites all their lives.  He had less tolerance for white people than she.  She wanted to let go of the thought of being abused, abused, and say, "We will go from here."  His position was, "We can go from here, yes, but don't forget what's been done to you, and which might arise again."  The two of them were very volatile for each other, but very good for the children.  Today I don't know if we would have experienced such a good life, because they would be divorced.  But they just thought you stayed there and yelled.  I still agree with that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they kind of, they didn't get along the best, but they hung in there for their children?
Speaker 2: Right.  But they didn't have a lot of, they didn't have the privilege, the privilege that you pay attention to home.  Your frustration can't matter.  They were frustrated, each with the other, but they were concentrated on us.
Story_ID: 111559
Speaker 1: [Now, can you] reflect on your childhood and give us a sense of some of the sights and sounds and smells of childhood?
Speaker 2: As a little girl, my mother [Edwardine Jordan Corbin Lewis] had to go to work, and she was not home by the end of the day.  So every day, they were creative.  They didn't have movements and programs, and God knows what all.  So, one day I went to piano lessons.  Every child took music lessons.  Now, I understand rich children; no such a thing, every child did.  I went to a Methodist neighborhood center where beneficent white ladies were civilizing natives, I suppose.  And we learned embroidery, cooking, singing Christian hymns, what have you.  Another day I went to dance lessons, and another day I went to elocution lessons.  I want to believe if that if they had been well-to-do, I would have played corner lot baseball.  So, actually, instead of being deprived because my mother went to work, I got more.  When I was four years old, I went to hear Roland Hayes at Boston Symphony Hall, still renowned.  He had just returned from a triumphant tour of Europe, and was a formal singer of lieder, German lieder.  The Germans proclaimed him this, everybody did.  And it was to my parents a foresight that we should know anybody of any worth who came to this city [Boston, Massachusetts].  And they took their pennies--and no one gave them tickets--they bought tickets for us to go to see this man.  I belonged, and still do, to an Anglican church - I'm not a good attendant, because I suppose my vision is a little wider -  called Saint Cyprian Protestant Episcopal Church [sic, St. Cyprian Episcopal Church in Boston, Massachusetts].  St. Cyprian was a black martyr who bore some of the scourges that were imposed on Christ.  Every Sunday I went to Sunday School and to church at this church--very character building, and aggressively moving ahead.  Most of the people in that church were also from the West Indies, one island or another.  In fact, my world--at a time when the Boston public schools were totally white, and put down--worst horrible things, put down black children, nobody could tell me that white was better.  In fact, when I went there at eleven years old to Girls' Latin School [now Boston Latin Academy] and found out that white children thought they were better, I was amazed, I never knew that.  So, I've not suffered from the emotional abuse of white supremacy, I wasn't allowed to.  I didn't even know they thought they were better.  And when I found out, I thought they were mixed up, poor things.  I've heard countless black people say how they felt in the white environment.  It was abusive to them, not to me.  I played happily with white children when they wanted to play.  And when they didn't want to play, I said to myself "They don't want to play," not because I'm black; that would have never occurred to me.  Blackness has been a song, and I've tried to teach the students and their families at the Elma Lewis School of Fine Art one of Marcus Garvey's favorite expressions, "Hail to the chief, for thou art black."  Blackness is a song, not disco, but a harmonious song.
Speaker 1: Now, what, you did a lot of things as a little girl.  What were your favorite activities?
Speaker 2: Things that had to do with stage presentation, like dramatic reading, parts in plays.  I hated piano lessons, but I liked playing that little solo in front of people.  I liked anything of that type.  I didn't like the sit--still activities.
Story_ID: 111560
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to school in Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: The typical Boston public schools.  Most of them are not there.  I spent most of my high school time at Girls' Latin School [now Boston Latin Academy], which was a prestigious time.  In the senior year, I decided that I was going to be a great actress, again, ignoring color.  And I went to Roxbury Memorial High School [Boston, Massachusetts] where I graduated.
Speaker 1: What's the name of it again, I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Roxbury Memorial High School.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: From there, I went to Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts] to train for the theater.  My mother [Edwardine Jordan Corbin Lewis] didn't like the training for the theater.  She wanted something more genteel, because only tramps danced, only tramps went on the stage.  She couldn't have... her elegant concept do that.
Story_ID: 111561
Speaker 1: --where you went to grade school, elementary school.
Speaker 2: Asa Gray [School in Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Asa Gray?
Speaker 2: It's gone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went to another school after that called the Hammond School.
Speaker 1: The Hammond School?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 111562
Speaker 1: Let's get going.  We're-- Let's see, we were talking about school.
Speaker 2: School was not a big item with me.  I got good grades, etc.  But the big items were what happened outside of school, all these various activities.  My brother [George Clarence Corbin], the next oldest to me, he was six years older.  And he was a scholar, he liked studying.  He became an M.D.  He went to Harvard [University in Cambridge, Massachusetts] and followed that route.  But I was more creative, I did more things and did them early.  But I didn't want to be taught, I wanted to teach.  I always had a better idea that didn't make me the pride of the teachers.  It still doesn't make me the pride of the dialysis camp. One, during this recent war, when we kept talking about bringing the Iraqis to their knees.  I could not, I thought they were wrong, the Iraqis, and especially if they were hiding chemical warfare.  You can't go in a man's house and tell him to come out.  That's the difference between Caucasians and anybody else.  That seems to them perfectly legitimate.  But I thought that was crazy, if they came here and perpetrated 9/11 [September 11, 2001].  That didn't take [President] George [W.] Bush to death; that was not their aim.  Their aim was to bring down America.  Our aim is to shoot the man.  How are we going to get together on this?  But I knew that as a little girl in school, not with those particular characters, but philosophically among the people.  I've never been popular with psychology.  Logic is my strong suit.  And then the nearer you get to another culture, the more disparate we are in the understanding of people, if you don't interpret their culture so that you can take the best parts.  During World War II, the battle in Europe was going poorly, and they enlisted the Russians.  I said the Nazis have not lost, because they had the feeling they could press on because they were pure Aryan.  But the Russians didn't fight from town to town, or from street to street, but from house to house.  That's philosophically where they were coming from.  So, they ran the Germans back across the continent into the sea.
Speaker 1: Now, ma'am, you were in high school during World War II, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: And then just at the end--
Speaker 1: I just want to make sure we cover enough ground here and get the chronology together, you know, because we don't have a lot of time.
Speaker 2: I was never talking about what other people were talking about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, well, in high school, did you have any teachers that--
Speaker 2: I think I was in college, I was in college
Speaker 1: During World War II?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 111563
Speaker 1: Well when you were in high school [Girls' Latin School, now Boston Latin Academy, and Roxbury Memorial High School in Boston, Massachusetts], did you have any teachers that inspired you, or took a particular interest in you?
Speaker 2: I had a privately elocution teacher who thought that the only thing for me was to be on a platform.  She had gone to Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts], and influenced me in that direction.  My father [Clairmont Richard McDonald Lewis] says when I was three, I saw a little girl on the stage at the UNIA [Universal Negro Improvement Association] meeting, and her forte was poetry.  And I said to him, "Can't you teach me something that I can do like that?"  And he did.  He enjoyed that kind of life, those stage presentations.  And from that day to this, I've been involved in public speaking of one sort or another--directing, acting, poetry readings, whatever.  I can't say he had the most influence over me, he and my parents.  He and my mother [Edwardine Jordan Corbin Lewis] had more influence over me than any teachers.  There were teachers I admired, but my parents really were profound in my life.
Speaker 1: Now I know that--from hearing people that were associated with the Universal Negro Improvement Association that oratory is a big part of the UNIA.  And--
Speaker 2: This was at a UNIA meeting when I saw the little girl.  And after that I was always on the stage, paid or unpaid.  And by the time I was eleven, I was paid.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that your first job on the stage, when you were eleven?
Speaker 2: My first, pardon me?
Speaker 1: You said that the first time you were paid on the stage was when you were eleven years old?
Speaker 2: No, I'm saying I was making enough money by eleven to support myself.
Speaker 1: By making presentations?
Speaker 2: Making presentations.  There was, of course, no television, etc.  And people were dependent on their recreation through concerts.
Story_ID: 111564
Speaker 1: We were talking about high school.  Now, you were in high school and you said you had a teacher that--
Speaker 2: That was a private teacher.
Speaker 1: Is this the one--
Speaker 2: At the time I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Was this the one that went to Emerson College [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a private teacher.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: See, I told you elocution was one of the things--
Speaker 1: Yes, Ma'am.
Speaker 2: That's precisely what she did, always influencing you.  Of course, my reality was that when I graduated from Emerson, my only choices were playing--and this is pretty much true today--playing indiscreet women or mammies, neither which was acceptable to me.  I then became a worker in community houses, mainly the Harriet Tubman House [Boston, Massachusetts].  And wherever I went, I didn't like the way they were doing it.  My mother [Edwardine Jordan Corbin Lewis] said, "Well, just start your own school."  And my oldest brother, Darnley [Leon Corbin], said "And use your own name, then everybody will know your name."  And that's the best advice I ever got.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Start your own and do it.
Speaker 1: Well, how old were you then when you started?
Speaker 2: Well, when he was talking to me, I was about twenty-five.  And I finished [in 1944] my master's degree at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  My undergrad degree from Emerson was Bachelor of Literary Interpretation [in 1943].  That night, my mother said, "Well, just have something to fall back on," the famous saying.  She said, "You should go to school and become a teacher."  So, I got a master's degree in education.  But I don't like to do what you tell me, if I think another way is improved.  So, starting my own school was the improved way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you started your school in 1946, was it?
Speaker 2: No, 1950.
Speaker 1: Nineteen Fifty [1950], all right, okay.
Speaker 2: In between, as I said, I was working at 558 Madison Avenue, which has a history of its own.  I was working at the Harriet Tubman House, which is now re-located, places of that type, where I brought culture, and especially English to black children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you say you brought English to black children--
Speaker 2: I can't hear you.
Speaker 1: You said you brought English to black children?
Speaker 2: Correct English.
Speaker 1: Yes, Ma'am, okay.  Now, so, yours was an elocution school, basically?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: All the arts, I said especially--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: But myself, I taught classic ballet for thirty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I used the Russian system, Vaganova [method].  All that is not really relevant, because those stories themselves take hours to tell and research.  But remember, I had had a very wide teaching as a child growing up.  I didn't learn piano by ear, I learned it doing the conservatory method, from journey books, which was profoundly boring to little children, but which are substantial in the basic theory.  I don't know if anybody uses them anymore.
Story_ID: 111565
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how did you start your own school?  How did you do it?  Did you have to save up money?
Speaker 2: If I had had enough intelligence, I wouldn't have started my own school.  I didn't know how hard that was.  But after I got in there, I couldn't turn back.  My father [Clairmont Richard McDonald Lewis] was much admired, much admired--I probably had a legendary reputation.  My father came over to school one night, overworked, and the poor man was tired and hungry.  And my mother [Edwardine Jordan Corbin Lewis] said to him, "I want you give her some money to run the place, because she's going to make a school?"  He gave me three hundred dollars, which was three months' rent on an apartment.  He bought me twelve secondhand folding chairs, two secondhand pianos, and moved into an apartment on Womack Street, which is in Roxbury, Seventh and Womack, on the first floor.  These are large house and large apartments.  I turned the dining room and living room, which opened together, into a ballet studio.  Across the hall, I had an art studio, I still have one bedroom and a piano studio. A little kitchen and two rooms off the kitchen were dressing rooms and other stretching activity took place there.  And a woman I had known when I was thirteen years old in dancing school, brought the first twenty-five children up to school whom I taught.  And no matter how large the population got, I became more broke.  I didn't know what the status was, but I really learned by doing the project.  I had five teachers who worked part-time.  They had jobs, I didn't.  I lived at home at my parents' house, and continued to rest on them while I brought this project to a place where it could at least feed me.
Speaker 1: How long did it take to get it to that level?
Speaker 2: About five years.  But we were over-run with students.  For one thing, I didn't accept money from boys, because I wanted boys.  As traditional, black people educate girls and let the boys rough it.  But I couldn't see how that could be successful, so I wanted the boys developed.  People would always say, "You have so many boys."  And I would just smile.  They didn't know that was--that the boys got something for nothing.  Those boys are still in my life today, all of my students are.  I used to lament the fact that I hadn't married and had children.  I have more children than anybody I know.  They don't let me need anything or want anything. (unclear) that they don't come and fulfill.  Many of them are large in the theater, at least fifty people teach and founded schools.  And I say to myself, Jesus had twelve disciples, that's all he had to tell his message to, and he told them to go out and spread it, and today more people in the world call themselves Christians than any other single religion.  So, these young people continue to multiply and grow.  More people have our message, and (unclear) profound writings or anything.
Story_ID: 111566
Speaker 1: Now, did you ever think about, did it ever cross your mind for one moment that you should go to New York City [New York] to, you know, get involved in--
Speaker 2: I'm still torn.  When I see some of my friends, [HM] Ruby Dee and [HM] Ossie [Davis], and the rest of them, I wish I was doing that, but I know I'm doing what I should do.  And all my friends, my particular friends, are jazz musicians, Max Roach and the bunch, they're always here.  In fact, Mr. Babatunde Olatunji just died.  His is my profound second family.  But I got the message from California where Randy Weston is playing there.  I hope you know the name, Randy.  If you don't--
Speaker 1: I do.  He played for many years in North Africa, he lived in North Africa.
Speaker 2: He was in Morocco.
Speaker 1: Right, I met him, yeah.
Speaker 2: He comes here.  My crowd is the theater crowd.  Yes, it occurred to me.  As I told you, that's what I thought I'd do when I came out of school.  And there's a hunger still there, with the profundity of what I've done and am doing.  And the dedication of those people who have been through it, they're still dedicated to me.  On Saturday night past, I went to the birthday party of a forty-year old who had little children washing cars and doing all kinds of things.  And I went up to them, and they said "I wanted to Disney, to perform at Disneyland."  I would say forty years, forty years ago, I had children doing the same thing, to go to the New York World's Fair to perform in the fair.  And so, it goes all around and increases.  She was there, the forty-year old teacher, who was my eight-year old student, and she was self-sufficient.  (unclear) We're all over America, we are outside of America, we're in Africa.  One of my students has a five-building school in Ghana that she put up herself, similar to me.  When she came home to visit me, I could hear you coming out of my mouth when I got up in the morning, "I don't want to see that butter on the table."  Simple things, but that's a profound message.

Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me about some of the people that you've worked with.  You were telling me off-camera that Babatunde Olatunji was someone who started off--
Speaker 2: He's my brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I could tell you, run down, I could stop to talk about all of them.  [HM] Billy Taylor and Randy Weston, Max Roach, Archie, what's Archie's last name?
Speaker 1: Archie Shepp?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I can't even tell you, there's too many.  All of them, that's my family.  Arthur Mitchell, I've known Arthur since he was seventeen.  He went to dance in a concert of my teacher, who is now in Washington [D.C.].  And she's right in her nineties, and still running the school.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Jones-Haywood School of Ballet.  Her name is [HM] Doris Jones.  Sandra Furey's husband--Sandra Furey was one of my younger children.  She is, was fifteen years my personal assistant.  Gloria Schultz, who was married to the Hollywood producer, [HM] Michael Schultz.  Gloria was a very fine dancer.  She chose to follow directing, and created many of the--Candace Scott, who was "The Wiz," in the touring company of "The Wiz."  I can't tell you about how many things he's done.  His resume is as long as his house, you know.  He has the (unclear) Theater in New York [New York City, New York].  I can go on and on and on and not say anything else for two hours, except what the kids who came from me have done, or are now doing.  One of my young women, (unclear), is teaching at one of the California State college, teaching women's studies.  They don't all teach in the arts, they teach in (unclear).  Every one of them has as an objective, though, changing the life of the student.  Whether they get the student from an elevated, elevated background or from the gutter, that's their objective, to equalize black people's opportunities in the world, not in America.  Renee Neblett has a school [Kokrobitey Institute] in Ghana, and I've never been to there before.  Five buildings she's put up in about ten years--a science building, an arts building, a dormitory building.  And she has exchange programs with some of the most profound private schools in America.  And she runs an exchange program over there, a junior high school there--(unclear) not junior, it's a high school.
Story_ID: 111568
Speaker 1: Okay.  Can--now, were you the first black person to open up a theater in Boston [Massachusetts]?  Is there a history of a theater in Boston?
Speaker 2: Not a theater, a theater school.
Speaker 1: Theater school, right.
Speaker 2: People have done lots of theaters.  I was in other people's theaters.  But until today, no one has a school like mine where a child comes, the child--all the adults came and studied all of the creative arts.  And after a couple of years, you encouraged them to specialize in one or the other.  And I don't say "go into theater, go into teaching," you choose the hill on which you'll die, and your natural abilities dictate that.  Until now, I don't take the gifted--everybody comes.  It's my belief that everybody has profound gifts, it's just how they're projected.
Story_ID: 111569
Speaker 1: Okay, Ma'am, can you tell us about the National Center for Afro-American Artists.
Speaker 2: As I explained at the beginning, it's an outgrowth of many of the emotional, cultural, and professional needs of many of America's blacks.  They weren't all of one discipline.  For instance, Charles White was a member of our first board, John Killens, [HM] Robert Hooks--it replicated everything on a professional level that we did at a teaching level at the school [Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts] that was open to blacks of the world.  The museum [Museum of the National Center for Afro-American Artists], for instance, has had works by Nascimento [Abdias do Nascimento] displayed.  We have traveling exhibits that I'm sure we can add when I'm off the air, that you can project on tape or something, because I can't really keep in my head all-- it will be hard to keep almost eighty years, because I was a little girl when I started all of this.  The Afro-American Artists Center has had (unclear) plays by [HM] Woodie King. And we even brought the Black Quartet here to be performed under our aegis.  When "For Colored Girls Only" [sic, "for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf" by Ntozake Shange] came here, and Ntozake had done our first teaching with us, it was quite normal that "for colored girls" would come through here under our aegis.  It didn't come through under the aegis of white New York producer.  We produced production after production.  Let me think of ones. [Amiri] Baraka brought two plays over here and did quite well.  [HM] Katherine Dunham, I could go on..  Talley Beatty, Talley's company was resident here for three years, they were part of the Center.  (unclear) As I said, profoundly professional things happened, and still does.  Babatunde Olatunji has just died.  We're going to have memorial for him all over the city of Boston [Massachusetts].

Speaker 1: Well, we were at the Playhouse in the Park [Elma Lewis Playhouse in the Park], which it was not funded.  People... the Boston Pops came in from San Francisco [California], where they were currently performing, into Franklin Park [Boston, Massachusetts], out of the musician's union.  So, it didn't cost anybody a penny to go to the park and ingest what they wouldn't have been able to, as black people of limited means.  Duke Ellington was my profound friend.  He came twice a year to the Playhouse.  He always opened the Garvey Festival.
Speaker 2: So, you had a Garvey Festival at the Playhouse too?
Speaker 1: In Franklin Park.
Speaker 2: Franklin Park.
Speaker 1: Which was a mess.  It is one of [Frederick Law] Olmsted's most brilliant designs.  But as soon as the black population moved this way, it was abandoned.  We physically cleaned and built it ourselves.  Now it's the pride and joy of Boston and they don't really remember that we were there, except marginally.
Speaker 2: Right, that's where the Playhouse in the Park was.
Speaker 1: That's where it is.  That stage, on which we performed, what was the year?
Speaker 2: For Playhouse in the Park?
Speaker 1: So that you--
Speaker 2: Oh, '72 [1972], I actually saw it.
Speaker 1: It was still not as developed as it became.  But whatever you saw there, we put there.
Speaker 2: It was beautiful, it really was.
Speaker 1: We put it up.  Not foundations, not government agencies.  The black people of Boston put that there.  We cleaned up the park for the golf course, and the black golfers have now developed it more.  And as is usual, they can hardly get on the course, they have to fight with people from the suburban communities for time.
Speaker 2: That's typical.
Speaker 1: As is usual, they would like to forget that we did that, but I don't let them.
Speaker 2: It was beautiful, yeah. (unclear)
Speaker 1: That was our doing.  An Italian fellow, Alpet Petruccelli [Aloysuis Petruccelli], whose (unclear) was somewhat later than I was.  But Al was and is our production stage manager.  He is sensational.  If you've seen any of that (unclear) center here in Boston or (unclear), he's the one who put it in.  And no matter what he's doing, he is the only one I can call on right now and say to him, "We can't get this done," and he'll come and make it possible.
Story_ID: 111571
Speaker 1: Now, can you tell us about the museum, The Museum of the National Center for Afro-American Artists [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, when you say desegregation became more of a contention in Boston [Massachusetts], Boston solved the problem of blacks and whites coming to Roxbury by closing most of the black (unclear) schools.  Now, that never appeared in the news.  What you hear is about blacks going to white schools, and being resisted.  Well they closed the black schools.  So this old mansion which was a school for disciplinary students went to surplus property, and they couldn't do anything with it, because they couldn't bring their children into this terrible place, which, as you may know going around Roxbury, is not a terrible place.  But maybe it gives it a different image.  So, we got that property for one dollar, by political maneuverings and pressures, and Lord knows what all.  So, it is no longer an old mansion.  It's in transition now into a museum.  And there are mainly African, or national and international exhibits in there.  The children can run up in there, if they want to and behave like responsible citizens.  Clubs meet there.  There are exhibits held there regularly.  I don't know if you know the painter, Jerry Pinkney?
Speaker 1: Yes, Ma'am.
Speaker 2: Well Jerry started with us here.
Speaker 1: He's one of the greatest illustrators of children's books in the country, right, Jerry Pinkney.
Speaker 2: He had an exhibit there over the last two months, a fabulous exhibit.  That's the quality of work we do.  Him and (unclear), we eclipsed the 100th anniversary of the Museum of Fine Arts, by presenting black artists from New York [New York City, New York] and Boston.  There had so many people they couldn't accommodate it.  That's the other thing, we're educating and elevating black people.  But if white people find something they want, they come along.  Because the point is harmony in the world.  At Christmastime, in early December, we do a production of Black Nativity.  Langston Hughes had a day in the park before he died.  But now we do sixteen performances of Black Nativity, that's our largest money-maker, and that's what pays the basic bills every year.  White people are the largest attendants.  Everybody, including me, is curious as to why we don't have more black people, because we have about seventy percent white people, and it's held downtown.  But I think the black people know Gospel and it's in church, so they don't pay fifty dollars to come, except they just want to be supportive.
Speaker 1: I think you're right.
Speaker 2: But white people find this thing amazing.  The cast is approximately a hundred, two hundred.  And a large part of it is children under twelve.
Speaker 1: That must be exciting for the children.
Speaker 2: Oh, it's exciting for the whole of Boston.  Camille Cosby came to interview me a couple of months ago for her oral project.  And she said one of her big excitements was going into the hotel and seeing all the staff advising out-of-towners to go see Black Nativity.  And seeing that it was so large in the city, she could hardly contain herself.
Story_ID: 111572
Speaker 1: Now, tell me about some of the, I'm just curious about some of the personalities that you've been associated with.  Can you give me maybe--what about Baraka, what about Amiri Baraka or LeRoi Jones, or Langston Hughes?
Speaker 2: Well, James Earl Jones said "You can't convince me that many artists can work together in harmony," but they do, they do.  I think Baraka was about as difficult as anybody we had.  He's got a reputation for that, I think, for doing that--assuming a virtue that he didn't really have.  I don't know what there is to tell, because I don't really pay their personalities any attention.  This is what you got. Work and shut up.  The easiest personality was Duke Ellington.  I remember one guy who particularly impressed me.  The bus broke down on the way to Boston [Massachusetts].  They were going to Franklin Park about six, to set up for an eight o'clock performance.  And when he got there, the hillsides were full.  We had five hundred seats, but three thousand people would show up, and he is responsible, was.  So when he found himself broken down, he didn't ride in the band with the boys.  Harry Carney, a trumpeter [sic, saxophone player] in his band, drove him, and the others came along.  And the tradition was they would call me and say--it was maybe three o'clock in the morning--I'm in the hotel, "You won't see me until eight o'clock, but I don't want you to worry."  He never worried, never, never.  But this particular time the bus broke down, and everybody was worried.  When he got the park, he said "Where are the boys?"  When they got there, he made them go on as they were, he wouldn't let them put on their suits and everything.  He said, "These people have been waiting for you for hours, and you didn't have enough sense to change in the back, in the bus, then you're on."  But his proposition was always to make the audience happy.  He used to come twice a season.  The young men now, not even young, they're middle-aged, say, "I'm grateful to you.  I wouldn't have known him, I wouldn't have known [HM] Billy Taylor if you didn't bring them."  But they knew everybody, because we brought everybody into this community.  We had, when the Chinese first came and wanted a relationship with America, they came to my school.  They were, the people of the community--let's see, the women's clubs, church clubs, state groups like Alabama Sisters or whatever, cooked the food, which was normal to them, and put it all around the auditorium of the school with signs, and let them sample the food.  "This is what we eat now and where we come from.  We come from Puerto Rico, and we come from Guyana," wherever.  Something similar was done when he had a tour of fourteen countries who had black ambassadors to America.  We showed them what we were, and it was good for the children to see, because they have a Tarzan attitude about Africans.  Each man was greeted by a child in his native dress, welcoming him in his own language.  And they ate all the foods.  You know, people said, "Where do you get the money?"  You don't.  If you go to the Barbadians (unclear) will cook something and show off.  And the Jamaicans have to do it better.  And then the Puerto Ricans have to do it better.  So, they were a nice, friendly, cooperative combination.
Story_ID: 111573
Speaker 1: I know that [HM] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan was a musician and a performer--
Speaker 2: Minister Farrakhan--
Speaker 1: Did you know him in those days?
Speaker 2: Not did I know him, I know him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He is my youngest brother.  He does not come anywhere near me without coming to see me.  One time he couldn't get uptown, and he had me downtown to dinner at the Westin Hotel.  He was a little boy at St. Cyprian Church [St. Cyprian Episcopal Church in Boston, Massachusetts], singing in the choir.  He's my youngest brother, my mother's [Edwardines Jordan Corbin Lewis] dear, dear, child.  But my mother had been dead thirty years, and it was his first time back in Christian church.  He came to preach a sermon that morning at St. Cyprian's.  We had to go through all kinds of rigmarole, going to the Bishop and everything to get this agnostic (unclear) in a Christian pulpit.  He's not an agnostic.  Most people don't know what he is.  He's added another dimension; he didn't throw any his dimension.  He was a little boy at those weekend events that I told you about, playing the violin for money.  He was supporting himself.  When he preached my mother's sermon that Sunday morning, half the congregation was Muslim, and half was Christian.  He said, "Mother Lewis raised me.  And today she didn't know I was going to be a Muslim, but I have brought Christians and Muslims together."  He's always here, and when he does something which white America considers untoward, they call me to ask me what's my position.  And they do that with [HM Reverend] Jesse [Jackson, Sr.].  Of course, Jesse's out of the picture right now, Jesse Jackson.  But I say, Jesse was, at the time, sixty, the last time we got (unclear).  And Farrakhan was seventy.  But I say, "These are not little boys you're asking me about.  Call them and ask them whether or not we bear the same philosophies."  They're my brothers, and particularly Farrakhan.  They said they thought he was dead. I said, "He's not dead, he's living."  I have stopped laboring that, because they'll call me from Chicago [Illinois] if anything's amiss.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was actually, was he raised by your mother?  I mean he was raised--
Speaker 2: Well, in the sense the church ladies do.  He lived with his mother, and they told his mother what to do or what not to do, and blah, blah, blah.  Once a Muslim gave me an award, and he was the speaker.  And he was speaking about my mother.  And his mother said from the audience--he said, "I often remember Mother Lewis coming down the hall in my apartment."  And his mother said, "And told me what to do with you, too."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he is really my brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's really my brother.  The newspapers and everybody are always after me.  I say, "We don't have the same philosophy, but if your brother came home, you'd welcome him."  And that's what I do.
Speaker 1: Now, now did you teach him elocution?
Speaker 2: No.  When I came along, everybody who went to school in Boston [Massachusetts] spoke that way.  This foolish assumption of Ebonics, or whatever it is, it's an assumption.  During the Civil Rights Movement, I thought the point was to elevate the poor, but we've shifted to go down to the level of the poor.
Speaker 1: So, it's sort of a reversal of the way it used to be?
Speaker 2: I beg your pardon?
Speaker 1: It's a reversal of the way it used to be, right?
Speaker 2: Universal?
Speaker 1: No, a reversal.
Speaker 2: Reversal?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And we, in a generic term, I don't mean any particular people, but I don't understand why the Boston [Massachusetts] black children speak like they grew up in Mississippi.  That's something they assume is fashionable, but you ought to choose which fashion you assume.  And "don't talk white."  Well, you're speaking English.  You speak English the way English is spoken.  If learn French, you wouldn't call it white.  And the way to learn a black language, you speak it the way they learn to speak it.
Story_ID: 111574
Speaker 1: Some of the interesting events happened in the summertime among my staff and other neighborhood people who used to run a food co-op.  You might have heard of the famous Faneuil Market [Faneuil Hall, Boston, Massachusetts], it was an open air market downtown where the projects comes in.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You can buy it for almost nothing.  We bring it to this kitchen and this house and re-assembled it--bags of apples, bags of potatoes, onions, whatever, whatever was on the market, and very good meat.  We were being visited by Senegalese, and I don't remember why the Minister of Culture Alioune Sene got back into the kitchen.  When he got back there, we were being very elegant in the living room.  And when he saw all these people assembling this food and going out the back way, he invited everybody here to [President] Leopold [Sedar] Senghor's seventieth birthday to enjoy the tenth anniversary of Senegal's freedom, and he wanted fifteen hundred scholars from all over the world.  So, ten of us got to go to free to Senegal for ten days.  What a glorious, glorious, experience.
Speaker 2: Now, when was that?
Speaker 1: I can't remember the year.
Speaker 2: Was it the early nineties [1990s]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Or maybe it was the late eighties [1980s].
Speaker 2: Late eighties?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: But it was in this more modern period of my life.  I was in much better physical shape, so I think it might have been the late eighties.  I will get this timing for you from [HM Edmond] Barry Gaither, who's the curator of our museum [The Museum of the National Center for Afro-American Artists in Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: All right.
Story_ID: 111575
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Malcolm X?  He lived in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Very well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very well.  Malcolm was also one of those directing people.  He had been a terrible person, very destructive, and perhaps the prison experiences were valuable for him.  It gave him time to sit down and reflect and come back to center.  [HM Minister Louis] Farrakhan was always a good child, always.  He wasn't somebody that needed to come back.  But you see, Malcolm early lost the influence of his parents, good or bad.  And he was a street dancehall person.  But Malcolm came to be very valuable.  You can't throw away any of your material.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you, I mean, was he ever a student of yours, or--
Speaker 2: No.  That was before I had a school.
Speaker 1: Before you had a school, okay.
Speaker 2: But in a sense, he was a student of my mother [Edwardine Jordan Corbin Lewis].  My mother had pretty much the disposition that I have.  My father [Clairmont Richard McDonald Lewis] would have been an intellectual, given the opportunity, divorced from the hoi polloi.  But my father was with everybody, up, down and across, and particularly, too, with young people.  He'd call Malcolm and scold him.  He'd come over--the other thing was, that earlier on, we were still observing our African traditions.  And young men didn't talk back to older women.  So, if they called, were called, they came and listened, whether they were going to do better or not.
Speaker 1: So, you knew Malcolm from the neighborhood, right?
Speaker 2: I knew all of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.  His sister, Ella [Little-Collins], lived here, right, in Boston, right?
Speaker 2: I think she's dead.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think she is too.
Speaker 2: He lived down on Humboldt Avenue, he lived in this community.  Farrakhan lived in this community.  I'm arrogant about Boston.  I say almost everybody whose name you know spent some time in Boston going to school, projecting their message, or just living.  [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] went to school here.  Ben E. Mays [Benjamin E. Mays] went to school in Maine and New Hampshire.  Just about anybody who you can think of, came here for some period.
Speaker 1: Did you know Dr. King when he was living here?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, very well.  He was a boy, too.  He was a very ordinary, loving, lovable boy.  But you could see that he was marked for greatness.  You can see the stamp of greatness on people by their ethics, their morals, their whatever.  It was interesting that Edgar Hoover assumed that all blacks were bums, and so he could take some of his filth and make it stick to Martin, but he can't.  He could say what he wanted to, but no one was listening, except Martin's natural enemies.  But he didn't turn anyone against him.
Speaker 1: That's true, that's true.  He threatened him with exposure, and it didn't work.
Speaker 2: We have had very profound experiences.  We who live in Boston, of people going through here, permanently, or what have you, that shaped the lives of black people in this world.
Story_ID: 110695
Speaker 1: Yes, tell us about Paul Robeson.
Speaker 2: Paul Robeson had the biggest heart, he had the biggest heart.  What America dwelled on was whether or not he was a Communist.  I would hate to think the Communists be the only people on the correct side.  That's why I say to people, "Was he a Communist? He was on the side of right."  He was probably, without knowing it, the original Garvey-ite.  His profound philosophy was, "We do it ourselves, for ourselves, and don't tell me how.  I know, I will evolve."  He was an unusual man, if you stopped to think that from college--he was a child of slave parents.  And when they were free, he could have gone the route of obeisance and humbleness to the former master.  I don't know what really took him to Rutgers [Rutgers College, now Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey], but he went to Rutgers and became a total athlete.  All of those times being abused, he became a very capable lawyer on Wall Street.  He was a singer like none other, and an actor like none other--all of these things untutored.  They were his natural gifts.  When I was eighteen years old, I was a freshman at Emerson [College in Boston, Massachusetts].  And he was touring the country in "Othello."  The arrogance of children then amazes me.  It seemed to me perfectly natural that he showed an interested in me.  Today, the kids say, "Oh, I can't go... he's a star."  But Emerson College was on the corner of Beacon Street and Berkeley.  And I walked across the commons with my eighteen-year-old self to tell him I was going into the theater in New York [New York City, New York], and I wanted to read Desdemona against his Othello.  I'm sure the man had someplace to go at break time.  He sat there and let me read it, and criticized it, and improved it.  And I went on back to Emerson feeling that's what he should have done.  When I think of the audacity of that?  It's amazing to me.  Now, ten-year olds would go to a rock star, eighteen year olds, but not to a Paul Robeson.  They've accepted that as natural.  He gave me great advice on entering the theater in New York, and my relationships with men, just like a father.  But I expected it, I didn't think I was his peer.  He was a man among men, that's all I can say.  He put out periodicals ["Freedom"] with a fellow [Louis E. Burnham] whose name I've forgotten.  Burnham is his last name, in New York [New York City, New York].  And they kept the black world informed.  He could do twenty and thirty things at one time.  And yet, we have permitted his name to be average.  Every child should know about the things he did, which were wonderful.  If you ask the average black child, they know that he was a Communist, but they don't know what he did for them, and why they're where they are.  That's the task we have to assume.
Story_ID: 110696
Speaker 1: That's one of the important things about your project.  But children aren't going to go seek that, unless they want to research.  Somebody else has to bring it to them, and compel them to look at it.  If there's a new science project at the Museum of Science, you compel them to go look at it.  Black people should assume mechanisms for compelling the young to know.  If they were Jewish, as they came into puberty, they would have to have a seder, a Bar Mitzvah, and they would have to know "Why is tonight the greatest night of all?"  "For this is the night that God delivered the Jews from the bondage of Pharaoh."  But we don't learn anything.  Right in my family, which is a profoundly black family, we have a grandnephew who was shocked to hear about Emmett Till.  He was shocked to hear all kind of things.  He has no profound memory of what has happened and what can happen.  Jewish people, on the other hand, will not let their children forget the Holocaust.  But we have got to see that our young know more about themselves than they do.  I can assume someone else's evaluation will never have been much, it will never be much.  They don't know about Timbuktu [Mali], that's a funny word to them.  They don't know that's one of the greatest riches, most developed world trade of all time.
Speaker 2: Yes, Ma'am.  Now, that leads me to this.  Is that--
Speaker 1: I can't hear you.
Speaker 2: You said, I think off-camera before we started, that your reason for starting your school [Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts] and--
Speaker 1: All of these things.
Speaker 2: All these things was to teach, to get a message across.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And so, I dropped my little drop of water in the bucket, in the ocean.  I'm more pleased with the young people going off to teach than I am with people who went to Broadway.  People say, "Well, where are your big stars?"  Fortunately, we have them.
Story_ID: 110697
Speaker 1: Danny Glover was smiling at me when I was--he was a legend in the Atlanta Black Festival, the National Black [Arts] Festival.  And I didn't know why he kept tipping his hat.  He said, "You're the cause of my being an actor.  When I was thinking about it, I read in Ebony about your Center [National Center for Afro-American Artists in Boston, Massachusetts], and I wrote you letters."  You know, I never read one of those letters.  The staff sent him things and advised him.  And he said, "I did that for a long time, and that's why I'm an actor."  And that makes me feel happy.  He just gave a large gift to the Algebra Project.  Do you know about the Algebra Project?
Speaker 2: Yes, Ma'am.  Well, tell us about it, tell us.  That's Bob Moses [Robert Parris Moses]?
Speaker 1: Bob Moses.
Speaker 2: And Danny's a board member.  We hope to bring him on our board.  He gave ten million dollars.  That's more spectacular to me than Bill [Cosby] giving twenty-two million to Morehouse [College in Atlanta, Georgia].  Because Danny certainly has more money than you and me, but he doesn't have the Cosby money.  So, the ten million dollars was important, to say that his insides came to support his people.
Speaker 1: Yes, Ma'am.  Now that's--now what, Bob Moses--a lot of people know--I don't think enough of us know--
Speaker 2: Nobody knows who he is.  Well, what he seems to be is a protester against the war.  That's all they know about Bob.  They don't realize what he has done and is doing.  Well, I want to get people to know him.  I said, "Did you see 'Mississippi Burning?'" "Yes, I saw the movie, but they didn't--" I said, "Well, that's the man."
Speaker 1: "Mississippi Burning" is sort of a distortion of what happened, and they had the FBI--
Speaker 2: I didn't hear you.
Speaker 1: I said in that movie they don't focus on the organizers so much, but they focus on the FBI, you know.  And he's, he was the hero of--
Speaker 2: That's the point I was making, that's what our kids know.  Whose fault is that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, ultimately, it's got to be ours, because--
Speaker 2: It's our fault.  As I said, the Jews have been persecuted around Christianity, I don't know how much before.  But they see to it that Jews know.  They see to it that whatever is Jewish and precious, they perpetrate among their people.  They don't hold black war, Jewish wars.  Uh-uh, they say come over there after school and say, "We're going to make you a Jew."  And they don't say, "Come if you like," you have to come.  Our children are, sadly very weak.  They're too tired, they got too much homework.  They don't have--the brain is marvelously elastic.  These little three year olds and these little kindergarteners and whatever, they've got homework.  You insult yourself when you say "This is all we can do, our scope is limited."  There's a poem and I think her name is Georgia Johnson, "Your world is as big as you make it" ["Your World"].  That's a poem that should head this project, or any other oral project.  I know, for I used to lie with my hands pressed close to the side, and now I fly, fly, fly.

Speaker 1: People know Angela, sorry, [HM] Maya Angelou, and they knew her from "A Caged Bird" ["I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings"].  They don't realize that the concept of "The Caged Bird" comes from Paul Laurence Dunbar.
Speaker 2: Yes, Ma'am.
Speaker 1: The reason they know Maya Angelou is because white people took her up, and said she's wonderful.  Why do they think she's wonderful?  I hate to say this, but I'm going to, Maya's one of my dear, dear, people.  But if she couldn't write about being a prostitute, they would never have taken her up.  She put herself where white people can accept black women... call in now.  But they would not accept her if she was really straight all along.  And they don't even know where she gets the book titles, or what she thinks, or anything.  Robert Schuller, he's a great evangelist, a preacher.  Had her on his program one Sunday morning.  And it was I think near Father's Day.  And he was saying what rotten people black men are.  He was saying it a lovely, smiley, Christian way, but he was saying it, about how they don't stand by their families, how they don't love their families.  And he had Maya read a poem of her choice.  She read, "Brown Baby" [sic, "Little Brown Baby"] by Paul Laurence Dunbar.  Do you know it?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes Ma'am, (unclear).
Speaker 1: They didn't even see that they were being corrected.
Speaker 2: It's about a father who's reading to his son, or his baby, and talking about his baby, you know--
Speaker 1: "Wish you could always know sun and blue skies." [sic, "Wisht you could allus know ease an' cleah skies."]
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: They didn't see how much he cared--the tears that were in him--but he was loving this baby.  And they didn't even see that what she was saying, that what you're saying is not true.  And it wasn't important that they see it, but it was important that black people see.  Now, some of them said, "She speaking dialect," and they didn't even know what she was saying.  She was saying, "What you're saying is not true."  But see, I'm direct and abrasive, that's not true.  She seemed not to be talking to the point, but she was.  That's a skill in itself that we have.
Speaker 2: Right, I mean, that's inferred in another Dunbar poem, in "We Wear the Mask."
Speaker 1: Yes, "We Wear the Mask."
Speaker 2: "That grins and lies."
Speaker 1: They don't see Dunbar as a profound poet.  "Throw him away, all that dialectic speech."  He was saying what he was saying, how he had to say it at the time.

Speaker 1: Now, you were friends with Gwendolyn Brooks?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us something about her?
Speaker 2: She was another profound woman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Very profound.  She didn't say everything she thought.  And what she thought, you had to have an open mind to receive it.  When she said it, your mind had to be open to reception.  There's a story she tells called "The Real Thing."  You have to have an open heard to hear that.  Gwendolyn was really--and she didn't bother with the trimmings.  The Muslims and the Christians are going through great fights about eating pork or not eating pork.  We like to do that, we like to waste time on little things.  And she just said, "Pass me some more of those swine chops."  (Laughter).  Gwen was tender.  She could not have gotten out in the fray.  She had the soul of a poet.  She was tender, she couldn't stand--she could not have stood what anybody, even Paul Robeson took.  And she certainly couldn't have been in a shouting match like [HM Reverend] Jesse [Jackson].  When Jesse was about, I guess he maybe he was about twenty-five, he came to the office.  And the kids were going through great changes about who was the most valuable leader?  [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] or--
Speaker 1: Malcolm X?
Speaker 2: Malcolm.  And in the middle of it, he said, "Why don't you keep quiet?  Did either one of them keep your father from getting a job?  Did either one of them rape your mother?  And they both killed the same number of white people, none."  And the kids hadn't thought of it that way.  "He used his tactic, and he used his tactic.  We were all in the same war."  I said to [HM Minister] Louis Farrakhan--because you are hurt when someone is talking about your beloved-- "Why don't you shut up and say what you're saying to us?  Why do you keep talking about those Jews for, what's the matter?"  If you go to Israel, when you get to the airport, some of them are dancing the hora at the airport.  Some of them are fighting on the West Bank, and others are negotiating with all the other Europeans.  He does not.  He follows both his West Indian raising and his Muslim tradition of being respectful.  He said, (unclear) "I want to say that I will not be dancing the hora." (Laughter).  He said, of the roles, that's not the one he's going to choose.  "I've got to say what I've got to say."  But he has never, ever, spoken quickly to me, or harshly.  He has never talked when I said to keep quiet at a gathering.  Not because it's me, because that's the way he was trained all his life.  The day I told you he had me down to the Westin [Hotel] for dinner, Betsy [Ross, later known as Khadijah Farrakhan] his wife comes over--they were teenage sweethearts.  She was calling him, and calling him, and calling him, and he kept on talking.  And then she said, "Eugene," and he answered, and she caught his attention.  And one of the other... "Is that what you call him?"  "That's his name, isn't it?"  And he came over and said to her, "What do you want me to do?"  No excitement, no shouting, they were married since they were teenagers.  People miss the essence of other people, and pull up one point and make it, that he shouts angrily.  I lost a Jewish friend who was talking about Farrakhan.  I said, "If I were a Jew, I wouldn't like him either.  But he's profound to my cause.  He's profound to my cause."  I said, "Look at him.  His brother is my color, his mother is my color.  And he's that color; that should tell you why he doesn't like Jews."  He got offended for life, because he knew what the truth was.  His mother had to submit to somebody, just like a slave girl, to feed him.  He doesn't forget that.

Speaker 1: I also like to think about, what's his name, in New York [New York City, New York], Al--
Speaker 2: [HM] Al Sharpton, with the hair?
Speaker 1: Yes.  He said, "When they do something to us, we're supposed to forget it, and join hands and sing.  But if we do something to them, we're to be punished.  But we're supposed to sing 'We Shall Overcome' when they do something to us."  All black people who survive and who reject any faith at all are complicated.  Because I always, like Robert Schuller, "I always love, I feel no pain."  They haven't been given any to feel.  They were the inflictors of pain, so they can forget.  But if you receive the pain, you are less capable of forgetting.

Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you--
Speaker 2: (Unclear)
Speaker 1: --what is your philosophy of art?
Speaker 2: That all things do in fact work together for good.  It's hard to keep that in mind when you're going through your terrible times.  You don't know how you got to sit here today; but that was planned from your babyhood, and mine.  So, things that look harsh and abrasive are necessary to refine you to what you are today.  That also is hard to remember when everything goes against you.  There's a powerful, total picture that will come into good.  And it keeps standing long after it should have killed you.  The doctors and nurses say that I should have been dead years ago.  I say, you try and you fight.  I said, "God, if I'm going through this, show me why.  Make me understand the purpose, and incorporate it and do whatever I'm to do."  And he does.  Those of us who don't overcome, throw away a valuable gift.  There's a young woman who lives in this neighborhood who did eighteen years, and was given life without parole for murder.  And she is a very big asset to the community today.  I said, "What-- wouldn't it have been wonderful if you had been raised differently?"  She said, "No, I needed those eighteen years in jail to teach me who to be.  All things have worked together for good."  She runs a skating rink where kids go to skate.  She can see them ahead of time before she injected herself into their lives.  That was necessary in her case.  A different lesson was necessary in my case.  So, God gave me a different experience, "Use whatever you get."  It's said many ways by many other people, "Turn your scars into stars."  If I am a pearl in the oyster, all things do in fact work together for good to them that love God and are called according to his purpose.  Some of those things won't work if you're not called according to his purpose.

Speaker 1: Now tell me, we always ask people what are your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: My black community is the world community, and my hope is that we will realize that soon, and not waste any more time with who's African, who's West Indian, who's American, and use whatever your gifts are to work them for good.  We spend too much time exercising ourselves about who's got a [HM General] Colin Powell job, and who's got, like Ann Hobson [Pilot], a seat with the Boston Symphony [Orchestra], and who's in government, and who is rich.  If I hear "rich" one more time, I'm going to faint.  So, there's so many millions of dollars that Michael Jordon, he doesn't want to give to his wife, whatever.  My hope is that we will all be brought together by common purpose, and then you fit in where you want to, but all to the good of us all, which then is for the good of humanity.  Because we can't stay at the bottom and the humanity thrive.

Speaker 1: Now, you've received, I don't how many awards, numerous awards, the National Black Arts Festival.  The MacArthur Foundation gave you the Genius Grant.
Speaker 2: I was the first MacArthur Fellow--
Speaker 1: Yes, Ma'am.  All right, Ma'am.  And all these awards and all these gifts and stuff, like, what do you see when you look back as your legacy?
Speaker 2: The people I've taught.  I hope to leave the physically-built Center [National Center for Afro-American Artists].  Last night I said to our museum curator, "Of course, I won't get that done, I won't see it in my life."  He said, "Yes, you will."  Because they are doing it.  So, if I'm dead, that's my legacy, a place where we can come and achieve some of this "all things working together for good."  We have a very extensive prison program.  We have very extensive professional programs.  It's all part of the black cause.
Story_ID: 110704
Speaker 1: Ma'am, can you tell me what, well, you didn't talk about what you plan to do next and what your--
Speaker 2: Next?
Speaker 1: Yes, next.
Speaker 2: On with this project.  I don't vary, I'm too stupid to change.  There's no next, it's always this.  This has been my life, and I tell people, you don't play with what people love.  You don't play with their husbands or their children.  This is my husband, this is my child.
Story_ID: 110705
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As one who offered no harm.  She good did whenever possible, and constantly tried to right the wrongs that have been done to my people.  I have participated in other organizations as trustee, so that I can inform some.  I do as much as is possible for human being.  I came out of the hospital with I guess the most long and serious illness I've had, and went to South Africa.  The world is very interesting to me, particularly the black world.  I have traveled, and observed, and corroborated with seven African countries.  I'm an honorary citizen of Senegal.  And that's how I'd like to be remembered, totally black.  I was brought up to say "black" when people said "colored" and "Negro."  In our house we always said "black," it didn't come as a shock.  And I can't talk about Afro-Americans, or African Americans, because it's just a small segment of what is black.  I would like to see them do more, because they have more resources than any other blacks in the world.  And if they would stop seeing themselves as poor, I'd like to erase the vision of poverty.  There are sometimes we're without funds, but poverty is a spirit.  As God and his spirit is not poor, you are not poor.  I have never been poor.  I've lived in this house for sixty years.  This is my parents' house, they were not poor.  They did not have large paying jobs, but they were not poor.

Speaker 1: Now Ma'am you said, before we started this interview you told me about someone you were trying to encourage to do something.  And they said, "Well, it's easy for you to do, because you're Elma Lewis."  And you had a response for them, and I wonder if you could tell us what that response was?
Speaker 2: I would like everyone to remember that your name is what you make it.  I am born a naked baby with nothing special, except the gifts which I come here with at birth.  What I make of them is important.  That's for each individual black.  And if you would like to put your emphasis on large cars, large parties, and go all of that, it's a terrible loss to humanity.  At this point, it's a more profound loss to black people, who need all the troops they can get to overcome.  I don't know what else to say, actually.  You have to realize that you come here with everything you should have.  I sometimes wonder why it was very easy for me.  My nursery school records show that at two years and eleven months, I spoke better than other people; I could sing and dance, and I could mimic.  I could do all kinds of things of the practicing nature.  If God gave me those things, and I am to use them.  Whether I could use them on the public platform is the exigencies of fate.  But I'm to use them however.  I have had thousands of people in my audience at one time.  It's just as important to talk to the one person who's in my face in a limited space.
Speaker 1: Thank you, Ma'am, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.
Speaker 1: All right.
