 Finchum Today is March 9, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop. We   re with Oklahoma State University.  Brown Oh, boy   Finchum And today, we   re in Tulsa, Oklahoma to speak with Owen Brown. This  is part of our Oklahoma 100 Year Life project, so thank you for talking  with us today.  Brown Maybe that   s what that woman was telling me about, that somebody  was going to come and talk to me.  Finchum That would be me. Let   s start with having you tell us when and where  you were born.  Brown I was born in Missouri, on the farm. They didn   t go to the hospital. I  mean some of them did, because they had large families. I was one of  nine.  Finchum Wow  And where in that were you? What number were you?  Brown I was the last one. I was the last one born.  Finchum You were the baby.  Brown And I outlived them all  My dad was ninety-seven when he passed  away.  Finchum Okay.  5  Brown And my aunt was ninety-four. Sister, ninety-three, brother ninety-two,  and that   s all of them. All the rest of them died before then. Some of  them had wrecks, got to  gestures drinking . You know what I mean  there?  Finchum They got helped along a little bit. So what year were you born?  Brown Nineteen fourteen.  Finchum And what month?  Brown October. October 15, 1914.  Finchum And you were born at home. What did your dad do for a living?  Brown A farmer.  Finchum What did he farm?  Brown What did he farm?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Brown Well, he and Grandpa were in cahoots. They had 150 acres, and each  had seventy-five acres a piece. And if one of them needed help, they   d  go and they would help each other. They had a fire, Dad   s house, so he  moved in with Grandma and Grandpa. And then, let   s see, Grandpa   s  friends in Allendale, Missouri, moved to Grant City, Missouri, which is  the county seat of Worth County. Then Grandma and Grandpa moved  there in Allendale, and Howard was supposed to help do the chores and  go to school there. I went to a country school myself, had one teacher  and about forty students. If I talk too fast, I   m sorry.  Finchum No, you   re doing great  Keep going.  Brown We   d have blackboards clear across the room. We had a lot of wood  outside. We helped to carry it in. Sometimes we   d play    Drop the  Handkerchief,    sometimes    Annie Over the Schoolhouse.    There was a  well down there; we carried the water from there to the drinking. The  boys    was over here, and the girls    restroom was over there, on top of  the hill.  Finchum Outside.  Brown Outside.  6  Finchum How was the schoolhouse heated?  Brown It had regular schoolhouse chairs, had desks, and a seat over here, and  then they had a potbelly stove.  Finchum Ah, okay.  Brown If you know what a pot-belly stove is, a big stove, and the stove was  sort of like in the center of the schoolhouse with a great big chimney  over there.  Finchum How would you get there?  Brown Walk.  Finchum How far?  Brown Oh, three-fourths of a mile, about a half mile. Maybe three-fourths of a  mile. We did it every   I did that for about   let   s see, see I was born in  October, therefore I had to wait until I became seven years old before I  could go to school, on account of  when  I was born. You were  supposed to  be born before  September, but I  wasn   t  until October.  Finchum Okay. You were one of the older ones in your class?  Brown Some were older, some were younger. I was about in the middle   I   ll  say half.  Finchum What was your favorite subject?  Brown Favorite subject?  Finchum What class lesson did you like the best? Math, science, what?  Brown Math. I   m going to put down arithmetic, yeah.  Finchum (Laughs) You liked numbers.  Brown Yes, I did. I got lots of compliments on me. Thinking about it now, had  good teachers. Some teachers would spend the night with us because  they had to go so far. And they stayed with Lillian and Ruth, my sisters,  half-sisters, from my dad   s first wife. See Dad had, Dad   s first wife  passed away with her seventh child. Maybe I told you.  Finchum No, that   s okay.  7  Brown And then Mother   this is my interpretation, he went to the bank, the  bank told him that there was a woman at the clothing store, and she had  two boys from her first husband. She was making dresses for women to  wear. She had her sewing machine, and she was making dresses for  people to wear, women to wear. And he got to meeting her and talking  to her, and finally, they got married. And I was the one that was born  from them. I was their only child, and I was the last child.  Finchum Okay.  Brown See Dad   s first wife passed away with her seventh child. Then he got  married to my mother, and then I was born. I was the last one born.  Finchum Well that seventh child, did it survive?  Brown It died with it   s mother.  Finchum Okay. So six with him, and then two, and then one. Okay. That   s where  the nine comes.  Brown Yeah. I was the ninth one, I was the ninth child. Daddy farmed.  Finchum Did he farm cattle or was it corn?  Brown He farmed corn and cattle, livestock, took care of his livestock, and  there was a trucker that came through, and if he needed to take stuff to  Saint Joseph, Missouri, they would sell it there. Then Dad would take  what they gave to him and he paid him. Then Dad would probably go to  Grant City and talk to the banker, because they were sort of in cahoots  with the other, they would help each other. I have a son, the same thing,  that   s doing the same thing because he has his own boat repair shop,  and these were my instructions to him, that he goes, whatever happens  in his boat repair shop, and that   s what Daddy did. If he needed any  help, he   d go to the bank and talk to them, they   d talk to each other, and  then they   d go from there on.  Finchum Well, did you have to help on the farm?  Brown Yes, ma   am. I was a little tot, about three years old, and there came a  pretty good-looking nice horse,    I want to ride Charlie, I want to ride  Charlie.    Well, my brother put a saddle on him, came out to me, and put  me on that horse. Oh boy, I felt good. Later on in life, I got the chance  to work that horse. I got to ride him myself, put the saddle on him  myself, and went Sunday afternoon with some boys, and I came back,  and then I had to go get the cows and milk the cows, every night and  every morning, too. I got to ride Charlie, I liked Charlie. And Dad had a  8  mare, black, Blaze. She had a colt now and then, but she and Charlie  were my team to work, they were my team.  When we moved to Allendale, I would help him plow the corn, have the  team hitched to the cultivator. We   d plow, and then one time he had  some property that he rented. Oats, I think it was oats, and he put the  threshing machine, threw some stuff into the hay mound at the house,  and they had a threshing crew. They had twenty acres of corn,  sometimes he   d rent some from other people, maybe ten. All together  they   d have about thirty, thirty-five acres of corn. Two kids, each had a  team, so we got to plow with the cultivator and our team, hitch to the  cultivator. Dad had a team, Dad had a span of mules he raised. That was  his team, Jed and Jerry. Jed would lay back, and Daddy would hit him  with the line, and then he   d get up. Sometimes, they had a little dog,  he   d tell the little dog to nip him on the heel. And he   d nip him on the  heel, and then he   d get up and do his part. Every once in a while, we  had to whip him with the strap, the line, to keep him pulling his share.  Finchum And that was Jed?  Brown Jed. Jerry was a good horse, he wouldn   t have to do anything to Jerry  because he always did his part. But with Jed, he   d lag. One time when  Jerry had passed away, Dad and I had some fun. We hitched Jed to the  plow, to plow the garden with, and Jed tried to lag up, and Dad and I  told him,    Jed, Jerry isn   t here now. You have to do it yourself.     (Laughs) Well Dad and I had some fun. See Jed hoped Jerry would pull  some with his strength, but Jerry wasn   t there to do it. I don   t know  what Dad did do with old Jerry, he might have sold him.  I had a chance in 1931 to live with my mother   s sister. In 1918, they  were wanting doctors here in Tulsa  Oklahoma , and Auntie had a sister  who married a man in osteopathy and she said,    If he can do it, I can do  it.    Well, she went to school and got her degree in Osteopath,  Osteopathy. And then in 1918, Tulsa was wanting doctors here in Tulsa,  and she came down and started her practice. Then in 19   let   s see,    31 I  guess it was, 1931, I was told to come to Tulsa and she would put me  through high school.  So I rode to town, and they had a meeting down there, building down  there at the, I can   t think of the name of the thing, anyhow, I had a  building down there, and people would come in and stay all night or  something like that. And they were going to go to Mexico. And I got to  ride in the backend of that pickup, made me a palette back there. Then  the man and wife would be up front, and I had a palette back there for  me to rest in. So I got that all fixed, and I came down here. We got  about half way the first night, first day. The second day, we got down to  9  Tulsa by four o   clock in the afternoon. I called my auntie and she came  and got me. And I was with her there in 19    she put me through high  school, and each summer, I   d go back home and help my dad on the  farm. And I   d do that until I graduated in 1935, and here   s my ring:  1935. (Shows ring)  Finchum It sure is.  Brown And with Auntie   s help   .  Finchum Well, from what high school? What was the..?  Brown Tulsa Central High School, where Public Services is right now.  Finchum Central.  Brown Where Public Services, I guess that   s the name of it, just a street from  that church. The same place where that   I   d gone to church on Sunday  night (here   s something I might have showed you) and here came a girl,  and I thought,    She is the prettiest girl I ever saw.    We got to dating.  She had her degree in typewriting and stuff like that. I can   t think of the  word, but anyhow, she was with Public Service Company. That   s what  she was working for, Public Service Company. And there were transfers  from Chickasha  Oklahoma  to Tulsa, and I got to meet some of those  other boys that did the same thing. They were being transferred into  Tulsa from Chickasha and from other places. And they got a degree and  had a raise in pay, and I know Lorene got one, too. But she a degree,  she had got a pay improvement because she had a degree. She could  type, and do the machine, and there   d be no mistakes. And I thought to  myself,    She   s the one. She   s the one. She   s the one.    And we got  married, and we were married there. The church was about halfway     the auditorium was about halfway done. Auntie sat in that part with her  sister, sat in that part during our wedding. And I can   t think of what  year it was.  But anyhow, we got married, and there   s about, oh, three or four,  maybe, years when we were living in an old shack of a house, our two  boys were born and we had chickens, west of Tulsa. I   ll think of it  pretty soon, maybe. Someone said,    Build you a new home, you can do  better than this.    So every Saturday we got all in my car, we found a  brand new home south of the fairgrounds, brand new houses. And I  found me one on the corner, empty, and the schoolhouse was right over  there. The boys didn   t have to walk very far to school like I did have to.  That   s one reason why I wanted to get a good close house.  10  Brand new home, lady next door to me, she thought they   d have a  driveway between the houses, I can   t think of her name. She thought  there   d be a driveway for the backend, in between the houses. I told her,  I said,    Well, until that time comes, I   m going to put me a shed for my  lawnmower and stuff like that, and leave the fence as is.    But it never  did come to that. She apologized to that because she had already fixed  her some cement for her lawnmower to sit on, built her something. She  thought she   d have a driveway clear across, but there were no  driveways in the back between the houses. It   s still there, still there, and  the house is still in shape. They got more privacy fences     Finchum And your wife   s name was      Brown Lorene. L-O-R-E-N-E.  Finchum Lorene.  Brown Alice. Alice Lorene. Alice Lorene Femer Brown.  Finchum And you were already out of high school when you married?  Brown Yes.  Finchum So that would   ve been the late    30s, maybe.  Brown Yeah.  Finchum How long were you married before she passed?  Brown Oh, forty years. Forty, forty-five years  Finchum Long enough to know her.  Brown Long enough to know her, honey  (Laughs)  Finchum And you had two children?  Brown We had two boys, Lewis and Terry. Lewis lived to be sixty-five, and  Terry, the one who is still living, he is sixty-three. And Terry is the one  that has, he and his wife, they have a boy twenty-five, and he is in  college now, and he   s trying to get to senior in college, trying to get his  degree in college.  Finchum So once you finished high school, what did you do for work?  11  Brown Well, I found a job at one-fifty, running tank gauging machines. And I  dated Lorene at the time, she said    Get you a good job, we   ll get  married.    I found a job for two hundred dollars a month. Yeah, we got  married. And then you   d find, at these oil companies you   d get two  hundred dollars a month. Then I found a teacher   s retirement check,  they started me out about, I   ll say a hundred. Then I got raises here and  there, and I got up to two hundred, and now I   m getting four hundred  from Tulsa Public Schools. I worked there fourteen years, Tulsa Public  Schools.  Finchum Doing what for them?  Brown Lawn mowing and cleaning, cleaning out the schoolhouses and doing  work cleaning rooms. For a long time I had to clean the kitchen. I had to  mop the floors, clean the floors. If they found a problem, they   d ask me  to help. One time,    You want to help the lawn mower?    These  machines, they couldn   t get in between the schools. You   d have to do it  with a lawnmower. Well, I hit a ball and broke the glass in the window  of the schoolhouse. I knew I had to pay for it, but they fixed me, they  razzed me about that. But I, a lot of times, I would help mow the grass  that the bigger lawnmower couldn   t get to. Let   s see, what else?  Finchum So when you were helping your father, did you have a tractor after the  horse after the team?  Brown No we never had tractors, no we just had the team. Each had a team  they plowed the corn, the field with cultivators. We didn   t have, we  never had tractors, honey.  Finchum And describe the house that you grew up in? Like how was it heated  and that type of thing.  Brown The schoolhouse?  Finchum No, the house you grew up in.  Brown The house I grew up in     Finchum Was it two stories or one?  Brown One story. One story house, yes ma   am. And we a kitchen stove, and  then we a heating stove in   I guess it might have been gas. Yeah, I  think it was gas.  Finchum Did you have to share a room, bedroom?  12  Brown We had    my wife and I had a room, and then the boys had a room of  their own. And then there was another room that had, we used for  clothing and storage, store clothing, like that.  Finchum No, but when you were little?  Brown Oh, when I was little?  Bishop When you were a child, what was your home like?  Brown Oh, that was when I was growing up, after they got together. I helped  milk cows, get the cows in and sometimes we got the horses in, too.  And I   d help milk, helped milk cows, helped gather corn. I   d drive the  team, while my brothers would throw the corn into the wagon. I would  harness the horse. I would put the harness on the horses myself.  Bishop What was your house like as a child?  Brown What was my house like when I was a child?  Bishop Yes.  Brown Well, they had me downstairs for a while until I was old enough to go  up with my brothers upstairs. We had a two-story house. Older people,  Laura and Ruth had a room, and then us men, we shared the other room.  It had two beds in there. And Fern and Raymond, Mother   s oldest boys  before Dad, they had a room over the kitchen, and Raymond didn   t like  Fern being with him so Fern   there was a palette in the room where  Laura and Ruth were and nobody was sleeping on it, so Fern got to  sleep in it until they, let   s see, yeah, until they got old enough to go up  to that themselves.  When Raymond got him a job, I don   t know what it was, but maybe a  farmer or something, help him out, and then Fern thought he could do  it. Fern had trouble with  inaudible , he didn   t have it done. He passed  away, Fern did. Raymond came to his funeral, Raymond did. Raymond  was married, and they had a girl, I think. But Fern passed away young.  He was about thirty-one or thirty-two when he passed away. Raymond,  I guess he was about in his sixties, I guess, when he passed away. He  had a wreck, he got drunk. He had had to shuck corn, Raymond had,  and he had done so well that he got drunk and killed himself. They told  Auntie and they called me and she said,    Let   s go to the funeral.    So we  went to his funeral, and maybe I shouldn   t tell you, but    ask how  much it was, and Auntie just wrote a check out to them and passed it on.  Because Auntie did good in this osteopathic, as a doctor.  13  Finchum She was probably one of the first women to do that?  Brown She was one from our family. Because Tulsa was wanting osteopathy in  1931, she came to Tulsa and started her practice. And she started  putting me in school in 1930. Let   s see, I moved in 1930, so yeah, in  1930,    31, I guess it was.  Bishop Well, where did she go to school?  Brown She went to a country school in Grant City, Missouri.  Bishop But I mean in terms of osteopathic school.  Finchum Osteopathic. She went to doctors    program. There was one in Allendale,  not in Allendale, there was one in Missouri that she could go to. She  had a sister that was an osteopath, and she got it in easy. So she became  an osteopath.  Bishop Did she go to Kirksville  College of Osteopathic Medicine ?  Brown I don   t know. Is that east, eastern part of Missouri?  Bishop Northeastern.  Brown Yeah.  Bishop A.T. Still  University .  Brown That   s it.  Bishop That   s where I   m from.  Brown See when I thought I was talking to her, here you come in  (Laughs)  Did he get permission from you?  Bishop Well, she would   ve studied under A.T. Still, then.  Brown She probably did, yes. She probably did. I   ve got, I can   t think of the  word, but anyhow it showed me that she got all A   s in her grades. She  got all A   s. I have her things she   d get, whatever you call them.  Bishop Now was religion an important part of your family?  Brown Yeah, yeah it was. We went to Sunday school. A lot of times, when we  lived on the farm, we   d either walk, and then there was a road, a lot of  trees. We cut them, we got permission to clean it up, and then we   d go  14  that way and drive over there. But we all went to church, and it   s still  there yet. There   s still a country schoolhouse. But there   s a  cemetery .  Lot of people buried there. Dad   s first wife was buried there.  Dad was born in Illinois, and he was about four or five years, a  neighbor moved from Grant City to  inaudible  Illinois, to  inaudible   Iowa, before he   d get across the Missouri River. Then they scattered.  Some of them stayed in Iowa, like Crystal City was one of them. Some  of my mother   s brothers moved to Crystal City, Iowa. And then Dad  and Grandma and Grandpa wandered down from Mount Ayr, on a farm,  and they stayed there. And there   s where I was born.  Bishop Were you ever baptized?  Brown Yes sir. I was baptized in a puddle of water. That was the only water we  could find, a puddle of water in the river.  Bishop What river?  Brown I can   t think of the name, Lost Creek. Lost Creek.  Bishop Lost Creek.  Brown And they   d find a puddle of water big enough to baptize people. And I  was sixteen years old. That was before I came to Tulsa. And then when  I was baptized, they had people in Tulsa accepted me, and I   ve been in  Tulsa since 1931, I guess. Now then, they had me ushering in the  church. And now I   m a greeter, and they are proud of me. If I can   t  come, I   ll call and let them know. But if I can come, the bus comes by  and picks me up, and they bring me back.  Bishop So you   re still a church greeter?  Brown I   m still a greeter, and I hand out programs and everything like that. The  guy just happened to spy my nametag that I had and he gave me a  different one yesterday, and I put it on my shirt. I   ll show it to you.  Finchum Did you ever think you would live to be a hundred?  Brown No.  Finchum No?  Bishop What   s your secret?  15  Brown Quit drinking. (Laughter) Quit drinking and make a man out of  yourself.  Finchum Did you ever smoke?  Brown Yes.  Finchum Did you give it up?  Brown Yes, a long time ago. (Laughter) I   m kidding with you, I   m sorry.  (Laughter) Yes, ma   am. What else do you want to ask me? I quit  drinking, too. (Laughter) I saw what it was doing to them brothers.  (Claps hands)    I   m quitting.     Finchum You quit.  Brown Just like that, too.  Finchum What would you do for exercise?  Brown I had plenty to do, honey. Milk the cows, go get the cows, go get the  horses, put the bridle on and put the harness on the horse. Hitch them to  the garden plow, to the plow, to the cultivator, and Charlie and Blaze  were my team. Dad had a span of mules. Excuse me. Excuse me,  ma   am. Dad wanted a span of mules. He cut a mare and a Jack, and she  had a little mule from him. They had a   I don   t know if that   s what the  word is. But anyhow, a little mule was born, and then they had   about  three years, did the same thing again. He had Jed and Jerry, was the  mules    names. Jed was born first, then Jerry next.  And Jerry had gotten grown and we   d have trouble with him getting his  food or breathing. Dad called the doctor, the doctor came and found the  trouble. Had him lay his head up and gave him medicine. He told Dad  what to do, and Dad did that, and Jerry became alright. Lots of times, I  helped my dad put harnesses on those two mules. We   d plow the  garden; we each had a team. Charlie and Blaze were my team. Charlie  was my horse, and Blaze, she had a colt now and then. Blaze and  Charlie were my team. Jed and Jerry was Dad   s, those two mules were  his team.  Finchum Well, would your mother can all this stuff up that was in the garden?  Brown We had a garden, and mother would do canning, yes. And we had a  cellar downstairs. We had a cave in the first house. Dad had to build a  cave. I remember that cave. We had cream and fruit, apples, and in the  kitchen, in another room, had apple cider. We had apple cider. You  16  drink enough of that, you get   . (Laughter) One time they sent me, I  got too much of it, hit the fan, and (claps hands) I stopped it. (Laughter)  Bishop Well, what   s your motto in life? Do you have a motto or a philosophy  you live by?  Brown Stay out of orneriness, stay out of orneriness, and don   t drink too much  whiskey. (Laughter) Is that a good answer? (Laughter)  Bishop What   s a typical day like for you at a hundred? What time do you  usually get up and what do you do?  Brown Oh. Well let   s see, I wake up about six thirty in the morning, and then  the time I get downstairs, that   s around seven thirty. Let   s see. I   m  downstairs by about a quarter to eight. Then on Sundays   I get up at  six thirty all the time, and then Sundays, I have to be downstairs by  eight o   clock, maybe seven forty-five, I   ll say it like that. And then eat  breakfast, and about eight forty-five here comes the school bus on  Sunday, and it picks me up and takes me to church. And then they pick  up somebody, if they haven   t. They   ve gotten about the whole street  now, but they have about six or seven in the bus. They have three or  four busses to go by and pick up people and take to church. Then they  bring you back home by around one o   clock, one thirty, two o   clock.  Some days it   s one thirty.  Bishop Well, what time do you usually go to bed?  Brown Ten o   clock.  Bishop Ten o   clock. And during the day, do you read or do you watch TV or..?  Brown No, I have puzzles. There   s those puzzles in the paper, then I have the  answers over here, and I put the answers in the puzzle. And it takes me  a little while to finish the puzzle. Today   s paper is over there, that   s  often what I do.  Bishop The crossword puzzle.  Brown Yeah. That   s the best thing, you put the words over here, and you   re  putting in   you   re filling the line. That   s how it   s, you say the  crossword puzzle, yeah. I do it, I do it every day. Every day there   s a  piece in the paper like that, and I fill it in every day. Take this word and  put it over here.  Finchum What   s the biggest challenge to being a hundred?  17  Brown Challenge?  Finchum Yes.  Brown Behave yourself. (Laughs) Not a very good answer.  Finchum What   s the hardest thing about being a hundred?  Brown Hardest thing?  Finchum Yes.  Brown Oh, goodness gracious.  Finchum When did you give up driving?  Brown Driving? When I moved here. Oh, I got to drinking too much, and  cigarettes. When they found out, I quit, they told me not to drive more.  I   ve quit driving now. Does that answer? I quit driving. I depend upon  the school bus, and then the doctors, the chauffer will take me to the  doctor as a patient. I   m a patient.  Finchum Right.  Brown That   s how it is.  Bishop Well, do you have anything on your bucket list you still want to do?  Brown Oh, goodness gracious. What am I going to say?  Bishop Anything you haven   t done that you still want to do in life?  Brown I want to continue    Oh, I read the Bible   May not be able to, I have  read the Bible quite a bit. Let   s see, what else. I hand out pamphlets to  people when they come in, I   m a greeter.  Bishop Anything in life you haven   t done that you   d like to do?  Brown Drink whiskey. (Laughter) That might not be a good answer, but it   s for  fun. I quit that stuff a long time ago. Cigarettes, I quit cigarettes,  smoking cigarettes, too. Drinking whiskey.  Finchum Did you serve in the military?  Brown No ma   am, I could not because my cousin and I were playing, we were  playing with a sling shot. Do you know what a sling shot is?  18  Finchum Yes.  Brown I stood up and hit this eye. And hit this eye right there, and it knocked  me cuckoo for a while, if you know what cuckoo is. (Laughter) And I  do not have much vision in this eye. But this one, yeah, I can wink at  you pretty quick. But this eye, I don   t have much vision in it. It   s  gradually going away, I think, but I still have good vision in this eye  here.  Finchum So that kept you out of the military, vision. You didn   t pass it.  Brown Yeah, yeah. And then I had Lewis, my oldest boy, he was born and he  kept, I can   t think of it, maybe I will in the next little bit, put him in the  service, thought maybe it   d take some of it out of him. He was in the  service for, oh, four or five years maybe. And it kept him out of this  drunken stuff for a while, and it went back to him. He married and had  two girls. Heather never got married. Heather never did get married.  Jayme got acquainted with a boy, and they got married, and he wanted a  boy. While he was in service, she had a boy while he was in the service.  And then later on in life, about, oh I   ll say, four, five, five or six years,  she had a little girl. So she had a little girl, and she couldn   t think of a  middle name for her. I said,    Rene        Who   s Rene?       Alice Lorene  Brown.    So she put the little girl   s name, Caelyn Rene Desoto. That   s  the little girl   s name. Lorene is my wife   s middle name. Alice Lorene  Brown. I can   t think of her last name, but I may be able to think of it  pretty soon.  Bishop And this is your great-great-granddaughter?  Brown Caelyn would be my great-granddaughter, yeah.  Bishop Great-granddaughter.  Brown Caelyn Rene, yes. And she   s in school now. She   s at about six years  because she came here a while back, been quite a while ago. She and I  sat at the head table. She   s Lewis   , my great-granddaughter.  Bishop You had two boys, right?  Brown Yeah.  Bishop Did you ever do anything like camping or any adventures?  Brown We did some camping because we went places in Boy Scouts, a little  bit.  19  Bishop Did you ever do any--?  Brown Where I was born, we had Boy Scouts in Allendale, Missouri. We had  camping every once in a while. And then, when I moved to Tulsa the  church would get together and we   d go camping here and there, yeah.  Bishop Now if history were written today, what would you want it to say about  you?  Brown Oh.  Bishop How would you want to be remembered?  Brown Well, how am I going to say this? Make some man out of yourself.  Finchum How do you want people to remember you?  Brown Make life, attend life, do the best you can. Because I   ve greeted people  at church, handed out programs at church. Be remembered.  Finchum You   re a people person.  Brown Yeah, yeah that   s what it takes. I didn   t go into the service. I didn   t do it  on the account they wouldn   t take me, they wouldn   t take me. That   s  one reason why I asked Louie to be in the service, because when he  passed away, the government did help us bury Lewis. And my wife,  when she, before she passed away, bury me, and then bury Lewis  Francis, bury him out here, and then his wife, and then me, all four  together, and that   s the way. It   s already paid for. I paid for it myself.  Finchum Got it all ready.  Brown All ready for me to be with my wife, and then Lewis got drunk and he  died, and he was buried over here, and his wife will be over here like  that. It   s already paid for, because I did it. And lots of times, I   d have  them to put flowers on my wife   s grave, and if they needed anything to  let me, and I   d give it to them. I   ve gone to them lots of times for them  to put flowers on her grave. And I could take you to the grave where  she was buried right now if you wanted to.  Finchum Let   s go   Brown I could take you, I know how to do it. I know how to get there; I   ve  been there lots of times.  20  Finchum I bet you could.  Brown I can take you to it.  Finchum Tulsa   s changed a lot since you   ve moved here, hasn   t it?  Brown Yes, ma   am. It   s changed a lot from when I came down here from  Missouri in the ninth grade, and I would help Dad during the summer  time. In the fall, I   d go back and go to school in Tulsa, Oklahoma to the  high school.  Finchum Do you consider Tulsa home?  Brown Yeah. Because I   ve been here. Auntie put me through senior high  school, and she found out that I could not get the grade. I found jobs  here and there. I was a job eater. You know what a job eater is. I was a  job eater, I had a hundred jobs.  Bishop What is your aunt   s name? That you moved here with.  Brown Cora Ethel.  Bishop Cora?  Brown Cora Ethel Snethen.  Bishop Smithen?  Brown S-N-E-T-H-E-N.  Bishop And she   s the one that was an osteopath?  Brown Yeah.  Bishop Was that her maiden name?  Brown Cora Ethel, that was her name. Never got married.  Bishop Snethen was her last name.  Brown Yeah. There was a bunch of Snethens came from England over here,  and they settled. My mother was one of them. Mother was a Snethen.  And there was Aunt  Maudie , Aunt  Ode , all those were Snethens.  They were born in Illinois, and there was a big little puddle of water,  and I wanted to see that. And when Auntie passed away, I got some of  her money, and I went to see that. I saw it, and I saw that great puddle  21  of water coming out of the sky, coming out of that hole or whatever you  call it. Saw a big puddle of water, saw the ditches that were made. I was  happy with that.  Bishop That was in Illinois?  Brown Yes it was. Yes, sir.  Bishop And she graduated osteopathic school in, I think you said, 1918?  Brown That   s when she started here in Tulsa, in 1918.  Bishop Okay.  Brown She had her degree, I guess, in parts there about 1917. She had her  degree in 1918. They were wanting doctors here in Tulsa in 1931, and  she did her thing,    If he can do it, I can do it.    She had a sister that  married one, and then her husband did it. Auntie said,    If he can do it, I  can do it.    And she did. I can show you her picture if you want me to.  Finchum That   s determination.  Brown Yeah, here it is. I   ll have to get to it, I can   t get to it, but I can show it to  you.  Finchum That   s okay. Anything else you want to add before we shut it off?  Brown No, I got the point that I   maybe I told you about riding and putting a  saddle on Charlie. Us boys would go to Jenks  Oklahoma  or someplace  to get us an ice cream cone. We never got any beer now.  Finchum Uh-huh.  Brown No. If you drink too much of that you   d, you would wish you hadn   t  drunk so much of it. (Laughter) We did have apple cider, apple cider.  Finchum Apple cider, that   s good stuff, too.  Brown I had so much of that that I ran into a fence; got myself a little beating.  (Laughter) I never did drink much apple cider. But we had an orchard  up in Missouri, I remember. Dad had a big orchard and got permission  from the bank in Grant City, Missouri, and they helped him make it.  They had apple cider, apples and peaches. They had a big garden, raised  a lot of stuff in the garden. Potatoes and beans and cabbage, and that   s  just some of it. Oh, they had corn. Let   s see what I can recall. They had  22  the garden, and they had corn, and then the orchard. And they had apple  cider, a lot of apples and peaches.  Finchum How would you do bath time when you were a youngster?  Brown Get in a puddle of water in a cup or bucket. We did have   what would  you call it, lay down in..?  Finchum A tub?  Brown No, a bathtub   you   d lay down in the bathtub, I guess it was a bathtub.  It   s got another name for it, but I can   t think of the name. Bathtub, but  we had one, like I have one here. I have a real masseuse before I take a  shower in here.  Finchum When did you move in here?  Brown About five years ago. I   ve been here about five years, honey.  Nineteen   you know, five years.  Finchum Two-thousand ten-ish?  Brown I guess so. I   ve been here about five years.  Finchum Okay.  Brown Because I moved in one thirteen, and then I was having trouble with my  tub, so they put me in one twenty-nine. Heather did that, and Heather  charged me quite a bit. Then I got the chance to move in here, (claps)  boy howdy  I   m glad I   m in here because it has a shower. Most of the  time, it   s kind of hard for me to get in the shower. I get me the front  with a towel and then the back and like this (gestures) on both sides  around me, and get myself all cleaned up. Feels pretty good then.  Finchum Yeah.  Brown But I like getting in the shower because it   s easier for me to back over  the rug.  Finchum Right.  Brown Yeah, but I take part of it pretty good. Front part pretty good. This left  leg is all swollen up, that   s the doctor     Finchum Hopefully, they can figure that out today. Well, I want to say thank you  for talking with us.  23  Brown Well, I   m sorry.  Finchum No, you   ve been great. Alex is going to ask you a few more, but I   m  done, okay?  Brown I thought I was through with him  (Laughter)  Finchum Not quite   Bishop You   re never done with me   Finchum Thank you   Brown You   re prettier looking than he is  (Laughter)  -------  -------
