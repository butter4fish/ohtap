COCO WILDER:  Okay. (       ) look at this. It&#8217;s like a little--.  MELISSA RADCLIFF:  A little bug.  CW:  I know. A little creature. And then we&#8217;ve got this going as a backup. It saved my life once, my interviewing life, whatever. So I'd like to get started. My name is Coco Wilder. And I&#8217;m here with Melissa Radcliff, who is the executive director of Our Children&#8217;s Place. And it is Monday July 29th, 2013. So I thank you for taking time out of your day.  MR:  Thank you. I appreciate the opportunity.  CW:  Yeah. So to get started I was wondering [if] you could tell me a little bit about your childhood.  MR:  Gosh, okay. [Laughing] Wow. So I grew up in Massachusetts in a small typical New England town. I went to college there and lived there until I had the chance to move to Arizona and then from Arizona moved to North Carolina. Have a brother, pretty I guess quote unquote normal American family with a brother, younger brother, parents, did the typical, went to public schools, played sports, played the piano, was a Girl Scout, that all American type arrangement. All of my family was close by in New England. So nothing too outstanding or I guess out of the ordinary for the most part.      CW:  Yeah, were you aware as a child at all or as a young woman or girl of like women&#8217;s movements happening?  MR:  Probably the first time was--, I mean again [I] grew up in a small town where everybody assumed everybody&#8217;s life was fine and things like domestic violence or child abuse maybe happened in the city but didn&#8217;t happen in our town, which of course we know is not the case; but at some point in middle school--it may have been my dad or it may have been a teacher--referred to me as a feminist. And said it in a very complimentary way; it wasn&#8217;t a negative tone to it. But I remember thinking, &#8220;Wow, what is that?&#8221; Other people weren&#8217;t being called feminist so what did that mean? That did get me thinking about the differences between boys and girls in school and role models and not necessarily blatant examples of what the expectations were for females but some subtle differences and how people responded. So that got me on a certain path although I don&#8217;t think it was a definite path at that point. It was more [that] it peaked my curiosity that there might be a name to realizing that things were done a certain way and probably could be done a different way, if that&#8217;s a way of describing it.  CW:  Why do you think your dad like told you [that you] were a feminist or thought you were a feminist in middle school?  MR:  My dad passed away three years, ago, was a very smart man-- both book smart but also about the world around him, a college professor. So probably a combination of being in a college setting and maybe seeing some of that, and I don&#8217;t know beyond that he could see certain things in me that maybe he saw in some college students--not to compare me to college students--but realized there were some comparisons. It was interesting because I never asked him why he referred to me that way. We just never had that conversation.  CW:  Did you embrace that label or identity at that time? Or like do you consider yourself a feminist now?  MR:  I don&#8217;t know whether I embraced it. I don&#8217;t feel like I didn&#8217;t embrace it. I feel like it gave me one more thing to think about, and especially in middle school where gosh, I don&#8217;t think anybody wants to go back to middle school. I guess it made me think there is probably something positive that will come out of middle school. I probably do consider myself a feminist although I also realize that for many people that has a lot of negatives attached to it. And so I don&#8217;t think I necessarily go around saying I&#8217;m a feminist. I guess I assume it&#8217;s part of who I am like a lot of other things I don&#8217;t go around announcing.  CW:  What does it mean right now? What is being maybe not an announced feminist but part of your identity, what does that mean for what you believe in?  MR:  I would say it means that pretty much always in the forefront, is for me thinking about how does the world look for and about and towards males versus females. What are the differences that continue and are they differences that in fact are possibly good differences or are they differences that put females at a disadvantage? Thinking about--which probably drives my husband crazy at times--thinking about, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s that choice of language and what is if you see someone in Hollywood do something? What is (       ) being concerned about the messages that are being sent in particular to younger girls about what you can be and what the limitations are that are imposed, still continue to be imposed by society?&#8221; I guess it&#8217;s more a feeling like I&#8217;m always looking and thinking about [it]--. I have two nieces, three nieces actually, and the fact is, they&#8217;re what two, three and five, and it&#8217;s almost impossible to buy a gift that&#8217;s not pink, which is fine. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the color pink, but it does make me think, what&#8217;s the meaning behind pink and why does it always have to be pink and princesses and fairies, and then for boys it&#8217;s trucks and building and-- why is it so hard to find something that&#8217;s not so pink or blue?   CW:  Okay. I guess I like fast forwarding a little. How did you get involved in domestic violence work and services?  MR:  Strictly by accident. I was working for the state of Rhode Island when I graduated from college, and the director of the domestic violence agency in Providence called and said, &#8220;We have a couple of extra slots in a training we&#8217;re doing the next day or two days later. Are you interested in going?&#8221; And the agency I was working for was talking about job training so my boss said, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go? There might be some opportunities there, a partnership. So go.&#8221; I went and there really wasn&#8217;t anything work related for me, but it really opened my eyes as they went through. I don&#8217;t remember now what they talked about. I&#8217;m assuming it was a domestic violence 101, but it really peaked my curiosity about what was happening at this particular agency, and then I had the chance to go through their volunteer training, which I really disliked. And I volunteered on their hotline, which I really disliked, and finally I said &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to do this anymore, but I would really like to join the board or help with PR. I don&#8217;t really like how you&#8217;ve handled your training and your volunteer program.&#8221;   I joined the board and became secretary and served on that board for quite some time. In the meantime I had the chance to go run the twenty-four hour hotline at the local rape crisis center, again in Providence. Again strictly by accident there was an opportunity; I applied for it; worked for an amazing woman who encouraged me each step of the way to try new things and then had the chance to move to Phoenix and again through some networking found a similar opportunity first at a prosecutor&#8217;s office and then at a police department again working with crime victims. So all strictly by accident. I mean there was no set plan. There was no &#8220;Oh when I grow up I want to do this.&#8221; It was &#8220;Here&#8217;s an opportunity&#8221; and people were encouraging all along the way so it gave me incentive to continue doing it.  CW:  Talking about the first work you did with the police department, the volunteer training and the hotline, what about it didn&#8217;t you like or what were they doing?  MR:  Yeah, so that was a domestic violence agency, and the thing I didn&#8217;t like was that they --I&#8217;m not sure they actually said this -- but the message I got was that we were responsible for what happened if people called the hotline. That&#8217;s not the case. I mean clearly if something&#8217;s going on, we have an obligation to call 911. But people make their own choices; you can help them make the best possible choice. You can support them. You can challenge them even, but you&#8217;re not responsible for the choices that people make. And that was the message that I got was that we were responsible, and I thought, I was probably twenty-two years old, and I thought, I&#8217;m twenty-two, I can&#8217;t be responsible for anyone but myself. I can&#8217;t-- and that&#8217;s what it was like on the hotline in the first few shifts about really intense situations, and the message was that we were responsible and I said, &#8220;That&#8217;s not a good fit for me. I don&#8217;t feel comfortable. I don&#8217;t feel comfortable suggesting to a fifty year old woman that somehow I&#8217;m responsible.&#8221; If something happens I should&#8217;ve done something differently. So that&#8217;s when I said, &#8220;Nope. I need to do something different. I love this agency. You&#8217;re doing great work, but it&#8217;s not a good, that&#8217;s not a good fit for me. So what are some of the other options that are available for me?&#8221;  CW:  Did you find that was a pretty universal or common thing in hotline work that you did? Or was it specific?  MR:  That&#8217;s a little hard for me to answer because then it was so in the forefront of my brain that when I went to the rape crisis center and then went on to do other work that was such, I was responsible for training volunteers so that was such a thing from the very beginning throughout training was that you are not responsible for people. And in times it&#8217;s going to feel like you could&#8217;ve done more or something better or differently. That&#8217;s to be expected but that you&#8217;re not responsible. So I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s necessarily, it&#8217;s never been my experience that that&#8217;s the case in other situations. And it may have been that I was young, and it was a new situation for me and that they weren&#8217;t clear that you&#8217;re not responsible. But that&#8217;s not been my experience since then. Thank goodness.  CW:  Yeah, no that&#8217;s a lot.  MR:  It is. It is.   CW:  Especially if it&#8217;s a question of physical safety.  MR:  Right. Exactly.  CW:  Intense traumatic experiences. Do you find there was a difference-- you said you worked for the Rhode Island police department like victims services-- in how police departments handled domestic violence cases and then how nonprofits that you would later work for handled domestic violence response?  MR:  It&#8217;s interesting because I've had the chance to work with police departments now in three states, Rhode Island, Arizona and North Carolina, and as to be expected each department is different. Even if there is statewide protocol or statewide policy, but each officer is different and partially because each situation is different. In Arizona they are very big supporters of the victim&#8217;s bill of rights and so there is a lot of focus on the training around that. And there is a difference. Domestic and sexual violence agencies do have a different approach than law enforcement. They have a different role. They are part of what I see is a community response, but their role is different. There are times when victims don&#8217;t want an arrest to be made. They don&#8217;t want to press charges. They don&#8217;t want to come forward and tell their story, and for law enforcement it&#8217;s important to hear from the victim because that helps them to make their case to make an arrest and possibly prosecute.  CW:  Yeah.  MR:  So yeah. So I do think, well I know their approaches are different, and at times they can be somewhat at odds in terms of what the victim really needs at the time or somewhere down the road.  CW:  You moved to North Carolina after living in the New England area, Arizona, did you perceive any regional differences with how the community responded to domestic violence or the way the domestic violence affected the community?  MR:  I would say probably more that was similar than different, but I do know that when I started to do some research in North Carolina that I had at least one higher up in a local police department say we don&#8217;t have a lot of domestic violence. So we don&#8217;t have a domestic violence unit. And I thought okay, well, I&#8217;m not going to argue but I&#8217;m going to guess statistically that&#8217;s not the case. So yeah, some differences with smaller communities recognizing that it is in fact an issue in their community. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s any different probably if you polled all fifty states, they&#8217;re all going to say the same, the thing is if they don&#8217;t have a lot of experience, the assumption is there&#8217;s not a lot happening in our community as opposed to realizing that it&#8217;s probably really hidden in their particular community.  CW:  And what was it like being on the founding staff of the Family Violence Prevention Center?  MR:  It&#8217;s interesting because this is about the time of the year that we started. We started July 1st of 2002. So we were very fortunate. The director and assistant director had been on board for several months, and then there were three of us started at the same time so it was great in terms of having some coworkers that were as new as you. You weren&#8217;t really the new kid, but every single decision that needed to be made, we as a staff made. I can remember at some point we looked at each other and said we&#8217;re tired of making decisions. If somebody could come in and tell us how to do it, and we had three of us [that] had domestic violence experience in terms of at an agency. One was brand new and didn&#8217;t, and the director had some limited experience. So it was definitely a once in a lifetime opportunity. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d necessarily want to do it for a domestic violence agency again, but it was fascinating to see, to continue or to start actually at that point with getting folks in Orange County to see this is a needed service and then to start being available to offer services to train volunteers. I mean that first group of volunteers my goodness, every other question we have to say, &#8220;Oh we don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;ll get back to you.&#8221; We&#8217;ll add that to a list of questions because we realize we thought we had a lot in place, and then all of a sudden we just realized, &#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t have that in place.&#8221; So had to give them credit for sticking through training and for going through the whole, the volunteer experience. I feel like I learned a tremendous amount about how you start an agency, what you do differently, and realizing that we learned pretty early on that it wasn&#8217;t even services. It was going to take time, but that folks were willing to take a chance with us and talk about what was going on.  CW:  Now were you, when you moved to North Carolina did you move because this was a job opening or were you here and then, what brought you to North Carolina? Do you apply to this job or--.  MR:  We moved here because we wanted to be back closer to family. We never lived in the Southeast so we picked the Triangle and said okay, we&#8217;re going to move here. My husband had a job when we moved out but I didn&#8217;t. So I took a little bit of time off and then through some networking heard that this new agency was opening up so I went and applied. And of the three new [employees], I was the first one and the other two came on a couple of weeks after I did. So when we got here the agency wasn&#8217;t even at the point of hiring. They started shortly thereafter.   CW:  Can you tell me what it was like to work for family violence from I guess it was 2004 to 2006, I&#8217;m thinking about the deaths of Shennel McKendall and Keara Lynne Hart that was two really public domestic violence cases in Chapel Hill. What was that like?  MR:  We actually marked our first anniversary with news of a domestic violence homicide, the Alan Gates case where he killed his daughter, his daughter&#8217;s best friend and the daughter&#8217;s two year old son, and that&#8217;s one of those days. I was the one that got the phone call from the DA&#8217;s office. It&#8217;s one of those days you mark as, people remember where they are on 9/11. That&#8217;s one of those days. You knew what it was like. There was a little bit of concern because we knew there were three victims and two had been identified. So there was a little bit of concern about how the third victim was. But it was such a powerful reminder to us about the need for services that you hate, it&#8217;s the worst case scenario. It&#8217;s the ultimate act of domestic violence, and yet it was a reminder that if it can happen anywhere, it can also happen here in Chapel Hill. It was also a really positive, I don&#8217;t want to say positive, that&#8217;s the not the right word. But it was a strong reminder of the fact that domestic violence does affect others. There&#8217;s a sense of, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m safe because my partner&#8217;s not abusive.&#8221; Well, this was not a partner. This was the father. This happened to be three people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time where [he] had other plans for what he wanted to do, came across them and killed them. So we worked quite closely with the two, actually all three families and really had the chance to see that even those who were removed from it what huge impact it had on their lives.   But it was also a pretty traumatic way for us to mark our first anniversary of, &#8220;Oh my goodness. Now what do we do? What&#8217;s the community&#8217;s expectation about how we&#8217;ll respond, trying to maintain confidentiality and respect for clients, potential clients but also using it as a time to educate the community about this is what happens?&#8221; This is what happens when there&#8217;s a history of domestic violence and when we as a community don&#8217;t respond maybe in the way we should. Here&#8217;s the result, and now we&#8217;re in the process of burying three people, and we start to get into issues of victim blaming. How do you blame the two year old who happened to be there with his mom and his mom&#8217;s best friend? There is really no way to fall back on that.   No matter how you have [involvement in the homicides], are involved or are aware of, or know of [them], there&#8217;s something about them. They&#8217;re horrifying. You realize and you see people suffer when they see their loved ones die in the way that they did. I was the court advocate at the time so I was actually in court the day that they sentenced him or he took the plea agreement. I can remember sitting there again with family thinking, &#8220;What just happened?&#8221;, hear him talk about what his plans were that day and what he did and recognize that family lived through that yet again. That maybe they kept themselves safe by thinking, &#8220;Well, maybe that&#8217;s what happened&#8221;, but now he was there in court telling exactly what happened.   CW: What did your community education look like after this case or how did you go forth and form that plan of &#8220;This is what we&#8217;re going to respond to the community publicly&#8221;?  MR:  Part of it was spending a little bit of time with our volunteers about what to expect if the media calls and what&#8217;s our plan around the media and making sure that they felt supported, that we might see an increase in the number of calls. People might be worried especially we thought folks who were in abusive relationships that they felt like were escalating so to see, to have people be prepared. And again I hate to say it but to use it as an opportunity for the community to say there is a resource available and it is your community, and you can call, you can call any time day or night. You can come by. You don&#8217;t have to give your name, but there are resources available here in this community and to talk about some of the limitations. So in the Alan Gates case there was a protective order, and he chose to ignore it. So to do some education around what does it mean to have a protective order and what does it mean to call the police, or what does it mean if someone violates a protective order. So using even pieces of it to do some education around what the whole case entailed. To say here is the part around protective orders; here is the part about resources; here is the part about, if you&#8217;ve been, if you are in [an] abusive relationship, what you may see more of because now your abuser might feel empowered knowing this is going on or if you&#8217;re concerned about a loved one, here are some things to think about. So overall strategy but also little bits and pieces that people could, could recognize and say &#8220;Oh, this is the piece that I need to know more about and be more aware of.&#8221;   CW:  And did, with the later ones like 2004, 2006, did you find your response change or evolve every time there was a homicide or were there differences or what did you learn from that first case and how you handled future homicides?  MR:  Gosh, part of this is really going off of memory here. Our response was the same any time, yes, but it was different. I mean it was the same basic response, but it was different because now we were an older, a little bit more grown up agency. People knew more about us so there were more calls. Whereas that first one we were brand new. We were having to say we&#8217;re a resource. Whereas later down the road we&#8217;d been around for a couple of years so people knew more about us. But the same part was the reminding people of it that yes, this is happening here again. This is looking at the state coalition about the number of [sneezes] Bless you. About the number of homicides in the state as a whole. Looking at what does it mean for the community. I was trying to think about it in terms of in particular for those cases about coworkers, and what does it mean to work with someone where you know something is going on and how best to respond? So again same overall response but also tweaking it to what those particular situations were all about and to go back to that first family and say I&#8217;m going to guess this is a reminder of what it is that you went through. Again supporting volunteers, the women in the support group helping them, maybe some extra support or giving them time to talk about what it was like to get the news that that had happened.   CW:  Tell me about the idea of the Family Violence Prevention Service, the candlelight vigils that you would hold. How would that idea come into place?  MR:  So there are a couple of different things. We did a walk for justice as one of the domestic violence month awareness activities. We did it for actually two or three years. I remember one year, it might have been the first year actually. It was one of those nights it looked like it was going to rain, and I think it actually did rain because I remember standing in the back of the line thinking here are all those people out there with their umbrellas and making the commitment to doing that. In terms of, it&#8217;s a candlelight vigil, whether it be for FVPC or any agency it&#8217;s obviously one piece of overall awareness. But I also think there&#8217;s something silencing and somber about [a] candle and yet also something uplifting. So that once you turn off the lights and everyone&#8217;s silent and it&#8217;s dark except for candles, that it can really help people to stop and think and remember and reflect and gather themselves in terms of what happened. But there&#8217;s also that sense of what does it mean for light and that while folks were killed and in many cases brutally killed that sounds somewhat clich&#233;, but their light is still with us. That what they stood for and who they were in our lives, that continues to exist, and they would want us to continue with their memories and doing ways to make it better for the next woman that walks in the door and the next man who&#8217;s [going] to call the hotline or the next child that reaches out in a school program.   So the other [event  is] -- somewhat of a tangent -- but one of the other events that we did was where we did a couple of things. One is that we had manikins, and each one represented a different segment of the population. So we had a child; we had a woman that was dressed to go to work; we had a teen; we had a man. Around their necks we hung signs that gave a statistic about domestic violence and the impact it has on different parts of the community, and we had them at different events around the community. And one of the reasons we did that was because there was nothing scary about them. They were manikins, and they were dressed in mannequin type clothes that you might say, &#8220;That mannequin reminds me of me so I would be curious to go take a look at it.&#8221;   The other thing we did was to set a table, a dining room table and leave a spot vacant and say &#8220;for too many families in our community across the street and across the country, this is what the next family dinner is going to look like whether it be Sunday dinner, whether it be Tuesday dinner, whether it be Thanksgiving, the holidays, anything where a family might gather is that there are all these places set except for that one place and talking about an empty place at the table and what that would mean for families.&#8221; Again it&#8217;s low key; it catches people's attention without screaming out at them or without being overwhelming, but then when people see it they realize &#8220;Oh, yeah that&#8217;s true. I hadn&#8217;t thought of it that way that that person is no longer part of quote unquote regular life for that family.&#8221;   CW:  And where would you put these tables or mannequins?  MR:  We had them at a couple different locations. I know we had them at Southern Season one time, which is a great spot, high traffic and people are not expecting that when they walk into Southern Season. Southern Season. That&#8217;s the one that really sticks in my mind. We had them in a couple other locations. We had some silhouettes that the Coalition Against Domestic Violence has which are literally silhouettes that stand up. They look like paper dolls. And they also have signs on them, and we had them at the courthouse one year and got into a little bit of trouble because the defense attorneys weren&#8217;t happy that judges and potential jurors were walking in and seeing those, and then their clients were going to court. So we had that invitation just one year, and then we were asked not to come back. So I always figure that did exactly what we wanted it to do, right. It generated some controversy, got people thinking. So I&#8217;m trying to think. The mannequins, there were several places, but I can&#8217;t recall beyond Southern Season. The table we did again at a couple of different events. I know we did one at the old courthouse in Hillsborough, and that may have actually tied in with an event we did for one of the homicides as like a candle vigil, candlelight vigil without the candles. But I don&#8217;t recall exactly when that took place.  CW:  Yeah, how did (       ) you see the organization grow and what do you consider your legacy to be there?  MR:  Legacy, gosh, I can tell you how the agency grew. When we started, again there were three of us. I was community education and court advocacy. We had a volunteer coordinator, and then we had a, it was supposed to be an administrative coordinator who fortunately for us was bilingual English and Spanish, and it took us, I don&#8217;t know, probably three weeks to realize she needed to move out of that position and we needed a Latino services coordinator. We needed someone on staff all the time who spoke Spanish. And when I left, that continued to be a concern. I mean it&#8217;s a concern for most agencies in Orange County. There are not enough Spanish speakers who are available. I mean really if you&#8217;re going to run a twenty-four hour hotline, you need someone twenty-four/seven, and we didn&#8217;t always have that and it was a struggle. And it got pretty taxing on staff for those that did speak Spanish to always feel like they were always being pulled in a million directions because clients were coming in. And a lot of times Latino clients would come in and bring friends so there might be more than one situation going on with some pretty intense needs often times beyond the domestic violence. So if they were here without papers, what did that mean? What about transportation? I mean, other concerns that maybe some of the English-speaking clients didn&#8217;t have as concerns.   So definitely a growth, a growth in the court piece of it. When I first went, I would go and be in court and observe and try to do outreach to clients, being subtle, catch them when they left court. By the end I had moved out of that position, somebody else was in it, and the DAs office was constantly introducing the court advocate to potential clients, dealing with safety but figuring out a way that made that happen and really feeling like that was a good working relationship that the DAs office is there for in many cases a very short period in a person&#8217;s life whereas someone from FVCP could be there longer term, connect them with other resources talk about other non-court related things that were happening. And as you probably know the domestic violence agency and the women&#8217;s center merged just a little over a year ago.  There were some the beginning parts of some conversations just before I left, but that definitely took place after I left. But again it was pretty clear that people don&#8217;t come in, and this is probably true with any agency, they don&#8217;t come in with just domestic violence needs. You may deal with that and then realize &#8220;Oh, there are some other needs here&#8221;, around job training or again transportation, or other needs that come to the forefront that once you get some of the safety issues or concerns addressed, then you can start to focus on some of the other needs.   CW:  I was going to ask about how you see the relationship between law enforcement and domestic violence change throughout your career and what do you think the relationship should be here?  MR:  I consider myself very fortunate because I feel like a lot of -- and mostly women -- but men and women fought those battles before I started. At the rape crisis center I worked with a woman who had been doing this for I can&#8217;t tell you for how long, and I mean she could tell some real horror stories about working with law enforcement and kept working at it and working on it. And when I left there, I was involved in several trainings with law enforcement where a domestic violence or a rape crisis advocate and police officer would co-train other police officers, which was huge to see that happening, and it wasn&#8217;t just I would get up and say, &#8220;This is who I am and what I do&#8221;, but we went back and forth with slides and exercises and answering questions, so that was a huge step, but again I&#8217;m fortunate that I didn&#8217;t have to get to that point. I picked it up at that point. Again [I was] fortunate in Arizona because I worked for a police force that had a whole separate domestic and sexual violence unit, whole separate building, specially trained detectives, so court--, advocates were right there. Sometimes we went onsite when a crime occurred. If not when they brought the victim back to the center, we were right there. So definitely an increased opportunity to get involved early on rather than having to wait later and having an officer realize, &#8220;Oh, I guess I probably should call someone.&#8221; This is more, but even there, there were still officers that didn&#8217;t believe victims or didn&#8217;t understand why she didn&#8217;t want to report and or didn&#8217;t, would question why she stayed for so long. The positive part of me was it was a great opportunity to remind those officers about why someone would say or why they wouldn&#8217;t want to report or why they didn&#8217;t want to go forward or why they dropped protective order. All the &#8220;why&#8221; questions we could spend some time on. But it was still clearly a struggle for some of those, for some of those officers. And then same here in North Carolina. I mean, we&#8216;re in Chapel Hill with an amazing police department but also part of a larger community where for some officers they still struggle with especially if they&#8217;ve been to a home or setting more than once. Like, &#8220;Why do I have to keep going back?&#8221;; &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t she leave?&#8221;; &#8220;Why won&#8217;t he report?&#8221; or whatever the case may be. But that sense of frustration, which I always think comes from not being able to solve the problem that if I could solve it, it would be better and you wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about [it], but that worry that I can&#8217;t solve it and I can&#8217;t make it any better. So we still have work to be done and you talk to kids so there&#8217;s still work to be done. But I also think and know there are some really great officers out there who recognize the importance of really understanding the issue, of being refreshed on the issue, of spending time with victims, not being judgmental and those sorts of things.  CW:  Can you tell me about your decision to leave FVPC and then transition into Our Children&#8217;s Place, which is still in the beginning processes?  MR:  So I left, we had had a couple staff members leave for family, medical type reasons, and I realized watching them leave that I was really feeling burned out, that one of the things--.  I can look back now that whole experience and say &#8220;Well, what did I learn? What did we do differently?&#8221; Probably a lot of things, but I was still carrying a pager and still doing hotline shifts even though I was the director. I had some directors tell me you shouldn&#8217;t do that, but I felt a little bit guilty because I knew if I gave up a certain number of shifts that someone was going to have to cover those. So I said, &#8220;Well, I can get this to work.&#8221; So it meant that I was still carrying a pager, taking calls in the middle of the night and still being in the office and not able to leave the office because we did four hour shifts. And if I had to do that again differently, I probably would say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to come up with a different plan because I can&#8217;t necessarily be responding to a call at two in the morning and then being available for a board meeting at eight in the morning or board meeting at six at night.&#8221; You can&#8217;t do it. So I decided, &#8220;It&#8217;s probably time for me to leave. I&#8217;m going to take a little bit of a break,&#8221; [and] took a little bit of time off. And then as I started my job search someone told me about Our Children&#8217;s Place, and I remember thinking I don&#8217;t know anything about incarcerated women. I don&#8217;t know anything about their kids. It sounds fascinating but--. And finally someone said to me, &#8220;But nobody does. That&#8217;s part of the problem is there&#8217;s not exactly a wide pool or a deep pool.&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Oh, okay. I guess that makes me feel better.&#8221; So I interviewed and did a prescreening phone interview, did an interview with the board and decided wow, no, I guess actually did two interviews and thought this is much more than I want to take on. This is, I feel like the learning curve is too steep, and it&#8217;s not really what I had in mind. So I called the board chair and said, &#8220;I really appreciate the opportunity, but you may have some better options out there.&#8221; Well, she called me about two weeks later and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a deal for you. We have some state money that we really need to hire somebody to get us going. Will you contract with us for say, three to six months, then you can decide. It&#8217;ll be like test driving a car. If you like it, great. If not, you can move on.&#8221; But she said, &#8220;I really think you&#8217;re going to like it and you&#8217;ll want to stay.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay, three to six months, that sounds doable and if it&#8217;s horrendous, then I don&#8217;t stay and we can figure that out.&#8221; And she was right, I was there for probably about two months and said, &#8220;I&#8217;d like to come on as your full-time executive director.&#8221; That&#8217;s how that unfolded. And that was gosh, six years ago now.  CW: And how did the getting off the ground process for Our Children&#8217;s Place compare with Family Violence Prevention Center?  MR:  Similar and yet different in many respects. We didn&#8217;t have staff ready to go so when Our Children, I mean FVPC spent three, four months getting ready to go, but we knew that even though we started in the spring that July first was our date to, our go live date. So we didn&#8217;t really have much of a choice. We had a building; we had a lot of infrastructure in place, which was not the case with Our Children&#8217;s Place. The upside of Our Children&#8217;s Place was about six weeks after I started I got a phone call saying, &#8220;The state has allocated or appropriated three point four million to renovate this building that you&#8217;re going to move into,&#8221; so that really takes care of a big piece of the fundraising piece. I thought, &#8220;Oh. This is a cool job. You answer the phone and people tell you [that] you have three point four million.&#8221; So I do feel like I was able to apply some of what I learned, but it was different in many respects. The subject area, people at least know about domestic violence. They may not know [or] believe it happens but they&#8217;re at least familiar with the concept. But having incarcerated moms and their kids live together was such a big leap for people that I do think that was a difference. And we knew at FVPC that we knew basically what we were going to do in terms of we&#8217;re going to have a twenty-four hotline. We&#8217;re going to do support groups. We&#8217;re going to do community education so we were going to fine tune them for what we needed and what this community needed, but we knew those were the basic elements. Whereas [with] Our Children&#8217;s Place there was really only one model it was out of California so it felt like there was so much more that we could do, might do, we could possibly do, but we weren&#8217;t sure, and the other big piece is that with a domestic violence agency you have some control over who your clients are. You can do a massive public awareness campaign and let folks know about your services that way and you can target it for your community. But if you&#8217;re working with incarcerated women they really only come to you one way, which is through the prison system. So it&#8217;s not as though you could send our fliers or emails or post on Facebook or do anything like that to get, you can make the women more aware of it, but there&#8217;s a limited population and you have to go through another entity to get to those women. Whereas here in Orange County I could put fliers up all over town. And I don&#8217;t have to go through anyone else; I can go directly to the potential client. So that was a pretty significant difference because there&#8217;s another layer there between you and potential clients.   CW:  (       ) It&#8217;s hard to sell people on services for women who are incarcerated. How did you educate the community? What was your strategy in finding allies?  MR:  So, well, a couple things one is, I have to keep reminding myself that, so we were in Chapel Hill, which is a pretty open, accepting, forgiving community. I have to remind myself that the whole world isn&#8217;t Chapel Hill, but in terms of a good place to start there were a lot of folks in the community that knew about Our Children&#8217;s Place because they were friendly with founding board members and they knew it that way or they were part of a prison ministry and they knew there was some connection that way. So some of it was tapping into the folks that already had some working knowledge of a prison system in terms of, in terms of allies. The other piece, which I continue now to this day, is pretty clear if people are not interested in talking about folks in prison. So then I&#8217;ll go to the child route, and I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;So let&#8217;s talk about the kids.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t commit a crime and we can discuss and argue or disagree about who committed crimes and what they did and what they got in sentence, but let&#8217;s not have that conversation right now and talk about kids and who&#8217;s left behind and the impact and what does that mean for them both while their parents are incarcerated and then when they come home. That seems to soften things a bit and so then you can talk about, if people seem okay with that, you say okay so what does it mean if a child doesn&#8217;t have his mom there or his dad. And if women are going to prison, or men, but as we start out with women, if they&#8217;re going to prison, wouldn&#8217;t we like them not to return to prison. So there are ways we can make services available so they leave in a better place than when they arrived. And I always say it&#8217;s not my job to convince people; it&#8217;s my job to give them plenty to think about and hope they walk away and hope they have some questions whether they&#8217;re good or not so good, but if we get a twenty minute presentation at a Kiwanis club, I&#8217;m not going to convince people. I&#8217;m going to, hopefully, I hate to say, &#8220;Plant the seed&#8221;, but to give them a little something to think about and take away with them when they leave.  CW:  Know your audience.  MR:  Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s a tough topic and they would like to think we put the bad people in prison and that&#8217;s the end of it, and we make a lot of assumptions about who&#8217;s in prison and what they&#8217;re there for and people don&#8217;t want to think about that. I mean, it&#8217;s easier to think about well, that&#8217;s where the bad people are and I&#8217;m not a bad person so I&#8217;m safe. And I don&#8217;t need to worry about it.  CW:  (       ) challenge right now facing Our Children&#8217;s Place.  MR:  Probably like everyone else, it&#8217;s funding. We&#8217;re focused right now on awareness and the advocacy piece and that&#8217;s not quite as tangible for people to think about. People want to think about how many kids did you read to and how many kids did you give transportation to and real hard concrete numbers as opposed to saying, well, what does it mean if we are presenting to the re-entry folks at public safety tomorrow or something that you might not be able to track the results from, at least not quite as direct as you can. Say we read to fifteen children last week or we did twenty tutoring session or whatever the particular situation is. So yeah, so the funding piece and [it] continues to be, it&#8217;s a tough topic, and I always think, &#8220;What can we learn from some of the other tough topics?&#8221; So what can we learn from domestic violence and child sexual abuse and cancer and death and divorce, some of those other really tough topics, some of which have a lot of political stuff around them and what did we learn from those topics, what can we continue to learn from them? And how can we apply them to issues around incarceration?  CW: So is there anything else that you wanted to touch upon or thought that I would ask but didn&#8217;t?  MR:  I didn&#8217;t really have any sense of what you were going to ask. I come unprepared for my own questions so, yeah, I know, you did a great job and made me think about some things.  CW:  Okay.  MR:  Thank you. Let me add one other thing as I&#8217;m thinking. So right after I started Our Children&#8217;s Place I had I guess somewhat of my own crisis that I had, I had told a lot of people I had taken this job but not everyone. And realizing now that part of my hesitation was I felt like I was switching sides that I had always worked with crime victims and essentially almost my whole professional life. And now it felt like I was potentially working with women who had committed a crime who therefore weren&#8217;t victims, and I was having a bit of, &#8220;What are people going to think?&#8221; and of course no one said to me, &#8220;Gosh, you&#8217;ve switched sides.&#8221; But I did have a couple people who sat down and said, &#8220;You&#8217;re thinking about this much too cut and dry that it&#8217;s an either or. The more you do this the more you&#8217;re going to realize there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of overlap and statistically we know how many women in prison have an abuse history either as a child or a teen or as an adult. Think about the women you worked with at a domestic violence agency and how many of them said to you &#8216;I&#8217;m glad something happened because if it didn&#8217;t something major was going to happen and it may have been me.&#8217; And to think about breaking some cycles so that if in fact children have grown up in an abusive home if they learn some behaviors, if there&#8217;s a way to make some services available to them to break it, then really you&#8217;re not switching sides.&#8221; So I still have every so often have that little twinge, but it was an important reminder that it is not quite us versus them or one side pitted against another that there&#8217;s a lot more overlap and that we need to keep addressing that what does it mean we send someone to prison. I think about in domestic violence situation now so let&#8217;s say a man kills his wife. So what does that mean for a child? Even if we say that child should not have contact with the parent because it&#8217;s not safe, what does it mean to be eight and now you&#8217;ve lost your mom and now you can&#8217;t see your dad because someone else has said it&#8217;s not safe. Even if we can&#8217;t arrange for that child to have a relationship with their parent, to at least provide the support that they need to deal with the fact that they now have no parents and what does that mean for them.   CW:  Yeah, that&#8217;s a good point. It&#8217;s a scary amount of overlap.  MR:  Oh my goodness.   CW:  In all these systems. [It] can get overwhelming, so many different angles to approach the issues at.  MR:  Someone said to me the other day, &#8220;I heard that you used to work at the court system,&#8221; I said &#8220;I did.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve consider myself fortunate,&#8221; probably not the right word, but I&#8217;ve worked with for the most part women but crime victims from when they first disclose that something happened all the way through to them speaking at the sentencing and every step in between, and all of those have led to me to have a much better sense of how well the court system doesn&#8217;t work and the impact that it has on people.&#8221; And that&#8217;s when I realized that the one piece that I had left out was what happens to kids when in fact a parent goes to prison. So that&#8217;s it. Now I&#8217;m done.  CW:  (       ) I appreciate it.
