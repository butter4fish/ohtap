(i 893-1979)﻿Theresa Danley:	This is Theresa Danley interviewing Esther
Mae Scott on November 3, 1977, at 10:40 a.m. Esther Mae Scott is known affectionately as Mother Scott. She has previously recorded for me in 1976. These interviews from now on will not be a duplication of what was said in 1976, but an enlargement and giving more of her background than previously given. Mother Scott has seen Alex Haley's "Roots" on television, but has never read his book and in some instances there will appear to be a duplication of what Alex Haley has written, but it's only because her grandfather experienced some of the occupational hazards and details which Alex Haley has so beautifully illustrated in his book.
Mother Scott, let's begin with your grandfather, his name and what you know about him.
Esther Mae Scott:
Theresa Danley:
Esther Mae Scott:
Theresa Danley:
Esther Mae Scott:
Well, his name was Monroe Cox, so he said. But how he got to America, as he told me, he was smuggled over here from Holland on the Mayflower.
Just a minute. Smuggled, that means he did not come on a ship with other slaves.
No, he was smuggled, his family, his sisters, and other brother was smuggled, he said, over here on the Mayflower. I don't know whether it's the first or second or third or what... I'm satisfied to know what he said to me, that he was smuggled over here from Holland on the Mayflower. They were crammed in the hulls of ships, and if you got sick or something else from being overheated or whatever, they would throw you overboard to the fish.
Did he indicate a date? How many slaves were on this Mayflower with him?
Well, he said it was quite many. He said they were in the hull of the ship like sardines in a can.
Theresa Danley:
The reason I'm asking these questions is that the Mayflower that brought the Pilgrims﻿2
TD: (cont.) from Holland was many centuries earlier and it hardly could be
that ship, so therefore it would have to be a ship that carried the name Mayflower at a much later date. The other thing is we do know that a yacht won a prize in the 1880s for international competition, so we know that a smaller craft was named Mayflower. The other thing is that word "smuggled" tells a lot because, after 1807, Congress passed a law making it illegal to import slaves, and in 1820, the death penalty was established for bringing in slaves illegally to the United States shores. So the fact that he was smuggled in indicates that it was an illegal operation.
EMS: That's right. He said smuggled.
TD: And they probably could not carry too many at one time if they were having an illegal operation.
EMS: Right. Right.
TD: Also, did your grandfather say anything about his life in Holland before he got on board this ship?
EMS: Yes, he said he was a blacksmith.
TD: Yes, in other words did he learn the skill of a blacksmith in Holland?
EMS: Yes.
TD: Now, that is also important because history tells us that slavery had
existed in Europe a long time before it existed in the United States, and the fact that he was directly brought from Holland would indicate that he was a slave in Holland.
EMS: Yes, he was.
TD: Those are the things that you and I are sort of exploring. Now, let's get
the period of his age. I think you can identify the date of his death; when was that?
EMS: He died in 1912.
TD: Where?
EMS: On the farm that he bought from the Polk place, what he give his son Jeff, one of his sons because he lived, Uncle Jeff, nineteen and twelve. It seemed to me like it was sometime in...it was a warm month, it had to be July, June or something like that, nineteen and twelve.
TD: How old was he then, did he say?
ESM Yes, from the way he give his birth, I think he died at the age of eighty-seven. . .
TD: He died at the age of eighty-seven.
EMS: Eighty-seven, eighty-six or eighty-seven, as far as I can remember, and I'm﻿3
EMS: (cont.) not too sure if it was eighty-six or e'ighty-seven years. I
could find out if I could go out on the farm, exact the year, but I'm sure it was...
TD: If he was eighty-seven at the date of his death, that meant that he was born in 1825.
EMS: I think you're right, something like that, yes.
TD: And that would be the estimate he made of his birth, and that he was born in Europe...
EMS: He was born in Africa, someplace in Africa.
TD: Oh, he was born in Africa then...
EMS: Someplace, yes.
TD: But you don't know the place in Africa.
EMS: No, I don't know exact the name of the place, it was somewhere in Africa.
And beside, I never thought that the time would come that I would have to tell or to talk about this, to give some reference of him and asking questions. I just thought I want to know, as I was always, they call...when you're smart and exploring, they don't call it that in my time, they called it nosy or something like that. And they wasn't much, particularly the older people, to tell you anything when a child would ask questions. But now, at times since I have grown up to be eighty-four years old myself,' I know what it means, and I wished I would have had the meanings or the...let me put it like this, the knowledge then that I have now. I really would have known, I would have asked everything that I possibly could, because I never would have thought the time would come that learning and asking questions, as you call it, and exploring would be so important.
TD: Of course, we all have those regrets, too, that we didn't ask more questions when we were younger, and it makes the research harder because of our lack of knowledge. Now what did he look like? Maybe his racial identity can be clearly pinpointed if we can have a description of his looks. What color was he?
EMS: Well, he was brown. He wasn't a real black man. He was brown, I would say something of an Indian color.
TD: What about his features? His lips, were they thick?
EMS: No. He had no big, thick lips, you can see, because looking at me and I resemble my mother, I've got her features and she had his features. As the rest of the children said, she was just more like him than any of them, and I'm like my mother.
TD: I presume you do not have a picture of him.
EMS: No, we did have a picture of my grandfather, but unfortunately the house burnt down in the country, out on the Polk place. You know what it mean when a house catch on fire, the shacks what they build for the colored people﻿4

(cont.) to live in, so we was lucky to save my mother. She was trying to save other valuables, things like that, but when they woke up, the house was on fire. It caught from the flue in the kitchen and all of it was connected, this kitchen with no floor in it at that time, and nothing but just boards and shingles, and it went up like paper.
What was the texture of his hair?
His hair was not kinks, it was not kinks. It was between, I would say, it was not straight and it was not kinks. It was a grade of hair that you could comb and it wouldn't curl up, it wasn't kinks. And he had, I'd say, a fair grade of hair.
Did he know anything about his parents?
Yes, yes, he knew his mother and he knew his father. His mother was named Phoebe and his father was named Ned, and so he said was Cox, Ned Cox.
I presume they had died before he came to the United States?
I don't know whether they had died or whether they had been sold for another ship and came over to America or went other places, sold as slaves.
Now you mentioned his brothers and sisters. Did the whole family come over on the Mayflower at the same time?
I don't remember asking him anything about any other brother but one. And that's the one who come over here, his name was Jeff, he named his son for Jeff.
And Jeff was...where did the other sisters come, he had sisters...
He had sisters, Adeline, I imagine she was Adeline Cox, I saw her, Manda, Phoebe. I think them was the three sisters I remembered that was over here.
But how did they come?
With him.
In other words then, you imagine that the whole family came over on the Mayflower?
What was left. Yes, I imagine so.
And that would leave the parents behind, as you say that...
Or else went on ahead, you know slaves are slaves, people are being sold, they go to another state to work or wherever they were sent...
He was adult when he was smuggled in.
Yes.
So that we will assume that he was roughly speaking, at least twenty years﻿5
TD: (cont.) old.
EMS: And I imagine he was looking after the other part of his family.
TD: Was he the oldest?
EMS: Yes.
TD: He was the oldest, and as I understand, when they arrived in the United States, they were purchased by whom?
EMS: My grandfather, Monroe Prentiss, was purchased by, was bought by Sergeant S. Prentiss. His brother Jeff was bought by a man by the name of James Buchanan.
TD: Now was there any relationship between Sergeant Prentiss and James Buchanan, or did they have adjoining plantations?
EMS: I couldn't tell you, I couldn't tell you about the plantations, I couldn't tell you anything about when they were bought or what relationship they had. But I'm just saying the two brothers would get together, and I'd ask questions, only on Sundays because they both worked.
TD: History is now telling us after Emancipation, after 1860, families who had been separated during slavery made every effort to get back and get in touch with each other. Is there anything that would indicate that Monroe and Jeff were separated during slavery, but met after Emancipation?
EMS: I imagine so, because they met, and I'm sure they lived close together on...plantation, because some of the farmers out there owned the farm. Grandfather was living on a Mr. Whitaker's place, what he called Marster Whitaker.
TD: Now what would the relationship of Marster Whitaker be to Sergeant Prentiss?
EMS: I couldn't tell you that either. I don't know how he come about it, unless Whitaker got him from Sergeant S. Prentiss, I don't know.
TD: Now, Monroe married...
EMS: A lady, my grandmother, by the name of Agnes Jane Garrett...
TD: And also you know who her parents were.
EMS: Yes, because my grandfather told me. Her parents were supposed to have been Colonel Garrett's daughter.
TD:	In other words, he was the white slave owner...
EMS:	Yes. And her mother, my great-grandmother, was named Fanny.
TD:	Fanny.
EMS:	I don't know her last name, but anyway, she was grandmother, Agnes Jane﻿6
EMS: (cont.) Garrett's mother.
TD: Now how did Monroe meet Agnes Jane?
EMS: Through the white people there. To be a man who would, for children, to
grow up children and raise slaves and he was a good, we'd say in the past, a good stud man.
TD: A good stud man, yes.
EMS: A good stud man for family, and they took very good care of him because they said he looked like the man was qualified, I don't know why, but that's what my grandfather said, that they were put together to raise families for slaves.
TD: In other words, the slave owners arranged that they would be put together so that they could have children which would be slaves.
EMS: Yes.
TD: All right. Now, do you know how old your grandmother was?
EMS: Well, I don't know exactly how old she was, I couldn't tell you very much about my grandmother, but you can picture this: my grandmother, Agnes Jane Garrett, died when my mother was eight years old.
TD: You have your mother's birthdate...
EMS: Oh yes, my mother was born at eighteen and sixty-seven.
TD: So we can then estimate that Agnes Jane died in 1875, approximately.
EMS: All right.
TD: That of course was after the Civil War. Now how many children did Monroe and Agnes Jane have?
EMS: Well, to my remembrance, two sons died in the Army, they was buried under military orders, and I can call the names of the children that my mother told to me, and I can call the names of the sons and daughters that I really did see. I saw all of the children except Mat and Quesie, that was the name of...that was the name my mother give me of her brothers that died in the service.
TD: And you presume those were the oldest children?
EMS: Yes, they had to be, because as I remember now, I remember meeting Lex; I remember meeting Fanny, that's a daughter; Alice; Indiana; Bill, his name was William, Bill was his short name; James, which is Jimmie; Mary was the baby child, that's my mother, Mary Liza; and John was the baby boy.
TD: You have also Jeff.
EMS: Jeff, that's right. I don't want to miss Jeff 'cause he was one of the﻿7
EMS:	(cont.) children. I'm telling you who I met, you count.
TD:	I haven't got Jimmie listed.
EMS:	Well, Jimmie was one of the children.
TD:	Yes, but when you talked with me earlier, you hadn't mentioned Jimmie.
EMS:	Jimmie was Grandfather's son.
TD:	Yes, I understand.
EMS:	And my mother's brother. I know him, Jimmie Prentiss.
TD:	So he lived to be an adult.
EMS:	He just died back here...he hasn't been dead over thirty years, he hasn't been dead over thirty years...
TD:	He married?
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	And what was his wife's name?
EMS:	Pinky.
TD:	And they had children?
EMS:	A gang of them.
TD:	I believe that you said that John was the one who was born after your mother. And your mother was born in '67, which was after Emancipation.
EMS: Yes. She said she was born the year of the surrender. Well, what year was that?
TD: Well, I guess '67.
EMS: That's the way she said to me, she said, "I was born the year of the
surrender," now you have to help me to look that up and things like that, 'cause I'm not a great scholar.
TD- So we know she was born free, and John, who was born afterwards, was born free. Now were any of the others that were older, like Fanny and Alice, were they born after 1860?
EMS: After 1860, oh no. My mother was younger than them, they was bom before eighteen and sixty.
TD: That's right. But what I'm trying to say, were all of the others born slaves?
EMS: It could have been.﻿8
TD: I don't want you to assume anything. Now, as you say, you've listed all those that you knew...
EMS: I knew them, the names that I'm giving you I saw.
TD:
TD:
TD:
EMS:
Now did they all live on the same plantation, this Polk Plantation?
EMS: Yes.
TD: So that's how you were close to them. EMS: Yes.
Now let's go back to your grandfather's occupation. You say a blacksmith. To people today, a blacksmith is a person who makes shoes for horses, but from what you tell me, he did more than just that.
EMS: He did, he did. He made wagons that was pulled, drawn by oxens.
TD: Now these wagons were wooden.
EMS: Yes, they were wooden wagons made from very strong trees, like white oaks and'hickory and ironwood trees that you can get in the country. Because I remember the names of many trees, I helped to clear up just for so many years for the Polk Plantation down in Mississippi in Vicksburg.
TD: Now that assumes that he was more than just a blacksmith, he was a carpenter.
EMS: He was a carpenter, he made chests, chest of drawers, wagons, rakes, spades, shovels. . .
Now let's see, these tools, rakes, shovels and all, have iron parts...
Yes, he would get this scrap iron and get together and shape it up in his fire or melting pot or whatever he had, because I was the little girl who would blow the bellows for him in the ship on Saturdays and Sundays. There was candy for doing that, that jelly bean candy and...
TD: About how old were you when you helped him?
EMS: When I would help him, I'm sure I was six and seven years old and five.
I had to get up on a stool that he cut out of pine tree, and made a stool high enough level—and a big tree—that I could stand up on and get to those bellows and blow it. The coal would be in there, and when I'd go up and down like a seesaw pole, that air from that bellows would liven up the charcoal, and he'd have his leaded plow points and his iron and different things and he'd get it real hot. I remember on another stool he had tubs there with water in it, and he had his fire tongs and everything what he made...
TD: He made the fire tongs. EMS:
Yes and when it would get hot, he put handles on them so the iron would be hot' but the handles he could handle with gloves. He'd get it hot enough for'to take his sledge hammer to beat on it, I remember that on the anvil.﻿9
EMS: (cont.) He would run to the water and get it hard and stick it in the water, and the steam would come up, and I watched all that stuff. Oh, if I could just have the imagination, just only had the knowledge then, what a beautiful story I could tell on him.
TD: That is interesting for the simple reason, today that is all done, but it's done in foundries, it's done by machines, see, and there's many, many occupations now that cover that one little thing that your grandfather was doing. Which also shows that he was a highly skilled workman.
EMS: Yes, yes, and only if my grandfather could have lived to see the changes from his first beginning of being a blacksmith, as he called it, to see what has happened today in the foundries and different things, what people have changed. But go to the root of it, he was some of the roots, that is the beginning. Thanks to God that I can remember and know that, he was
a beginning.
TD: It was very important that he have exact measurements...
EMS: Yes.
TD: What was his educational background?
EMS- I couldn't tell you, darling, I don't know whether it was a gift from
God or whether it was from a school, I don't know really what it was from.
TD: Well now, wait a minute. Could he read and write?
EMS: Oh yes.
TD: He could read and write. But you don't know where he learned to read and
EMS:
TD: EMS:
TD:
EMS:
write.
No, I don't, and I don't know what grade he made and I couldn't tell that part. But I know I'd see him with his pencil, them big pencils or markers, whatever you'd call it, he would mark, write or something, but he'd often do that. And he had a saw and things like that to cut off what he wanted, and he'd put part of it in the fire and get it like he wanted it and knock it off, I would see that, and run to the tub of water he would have, and stick it in there and get it hard, and go all over again.
The word hard is very significant, 'cause they call that hardening of...
He did ....hardening the steel or the iron or whatever, yes he did, yes he did.
Also I believe you said that he made andirons for the fireplace.
He did, he did, for to put logs on, for the fireplace. And he could lay bricks, and he had sons could lay bricks.
TD: That's another thing. Did his brother Jeff also have that same kind of training, was he a blacksmith?
EMS: He was a farmer, he was a farmer.﻿10
TD:
Was there any other blacksmith on the plantation?
EMS: No.
He made and repaired all the tools?
TD: EMS
TD:
EMS:
TD:
He did, and then he began to train other people, what I remember, Isaac Lee, and he became a good helper for my grandfather.
TD: In other words, he had apprentices.
EMS: I called him Uncle Ike, that's right, Isaac Lee.
TD: Was he the one that married into the family?
EMS: Well, Isaac Lee's son, Robert Lee, is who married my sister.
TD: Your sister Clara. I see.
EMS- And besides Lee was the man who run the gin for Mr. Polk, on the Polk
plantation. What my grandfather was the one who kept up all the works, whenever something would break down, my grandfather, that's why he would come in, Monroe Prentiss.
If he learned this skill as a carpenter, blacksmith and a brickmason before he ever came to the United States, before he was smuggled to the United States, it meant he was a very valuable slave. Also, if there were no other blacksmiths on the plantation, he was very important to the plantation.
EMS: He meant everything to Mr. Polk.
TD: Well, we haven't gotten to Mr. Polk yet, let's...of course, I realize that you knew Mr. Polk. Let's get back to the Prentiss... it was the Prentiss plantation before it was the Polk plantation?
I suppose. I don't know who Mr. Polk bought that plantation from, I don't know.
So your grandfather was never a slave to Mr. Polk?
EMS:	No.
TD:	So it has to be somebody prior to that and you assume it is Prentiss, since that was his name.
EMS:	Right.
TD:	Your grandfather was here during the Civil War.
EMS:	Yes, he sure was. But he didn't fight.
TD:	Why didn't he fight?
EMS:	Because I guess he was important to the man who owned him, and he didn't﻿11
EMS: (cont.) want to take a chance on him getting killed. When this battle
started in Shiloh Bottom, so my grandfather said, he had the ox team and went to get the supplies for Mr. Whitaker, and he could hear the shooting and things like that, and he said he looked up on Shiloh Hill, coming down there was men's blood running down like water. And the way he took to the woods and left the oxen to go home. Somehow or another, those oxen went home and they wasn't molested, they wasn't killed. And he said Marster Whitaker knew he was somewhere, but he couldn't tell where because he wasn't on the ox trip, that's what they was traveling with, and that's what they were using instead of mules and things, the yokes of oxen. Grandfather had made the yokes and everything, and trained them oxen and hauled, "gee" just like that for the oxen, and could call by name. I've heard him do it a many times, 'cause sometime he would take all the oxen, sometime he'd have four yokes, which would be eight, two in a yoke. But he would take six of them away, and just take two oxen and take us for a ride on Sunday, after we helped him in the shop and the bellows and the wagons and things that he'd have made, he'd taken us for a ride in the wagon with the oxen pulling 'em. We'd have so much fun eating that candy and listening to Grandfather's stories, going over the lake and Big Black bridge and from Warren County to Hinds County.
TD: Big Black bridge is...
EMS- Yes going across Big Black River, yes, Big Black River that empties into,
I think the Mississippi River. I've been across it a many, many times, and I know before it wasn't much more than a stream, but it's a huge place now. Least it was in '47, because I haven't been back on the place since my mother died. She died in 1947.
TD: Now, getting back to this battle of Shiloh, he was afraid that he would be involved in the battle?
EMS:
He was afraid that he'd get killed.
TD: But he was not in the military.
EMS: No, he never was...
TD: There was some attempt to draft...the Confederacy attempted to draft some
EMS:
EMS:
of the slaves.
Yes but Mr. Whitaker didn't. I think they kept him in the dining room, and'a mansion man, or help around the kitchen and dining room and in the shops and places. They didn't allow him out, and would hide him and conceal him Because he said a many times when the infantrymen would come along on horses, then they'd look up and see the Yankees coming, they d take him
and hide him.
TD: Hide your grandfather.
Hide my grandfather. Yes, he told that and laughed about it. 'Course we called him a coward, least we know not exactly a coward, he was 3ust important around the place and they kept him for safety.﻿12
TD: He was very important, and if the Army would have ever gotten a hold of him, they would have used him too.
EMS: Maybe so.
TD: Now this was, of course, all during slavery.
EMS: Well, you see, Grandfather didn't know that. But maybe his owners knowed it, and they didn't want him to get away from them. And I didn't know it either. Why, Grandfather didn't know he was that important. Grandfather just thought that what he did around the house, they needed somebody like that that was trustworthy and could do the work and do the things out on the farm and do the things what they needed to be done and that's why they...
TD: Was there any attempt to, on the part of the slave owners, to tell him how important he was?
EMS:
I don't think they told him.
TD: They wanted to keep him in ignorance?
EMS: They did, they did. Oh no, I can tell you, you know they wanted to keep him ignorant. You listen to me, I'm wearing a slave name now, and some people resent hearing me say about the slave name, but to me, I think it's important. They say, "Well, what's so important about it, it's just like a cow or mule, or any other animal with the master's brand on 'em, I don't think that's so important."
TD- Actually, I don't know why anybody should condemn anybody for their surname, it just is more or less an identification. But those people who condemn slave names have to remember that the names that they assumed from their white masters, that somewhere along the line, the white masters were serfs in Europe. And a serf was not too different from a slave and they had to assume...so that name if you go back on it, there was a period when nobody had a surname, see, and they had to take it. So I don't know why it s that important or if you could look on...that name of Prentiss would be what you make it, isn't it?
EMS: Sure, and I'm not ashamed of it.
TD: Well, that's right.
I'm not ashamed of it,-not, I'm still...my mother died with a slave name, Prentiss, and my grandfather died with a slave name. I got married, but I was Esther Prentiss Scott and I was a Prentiss before I was a Scott, 'cause I married a Scott, if you know what I'm saying, and I'm not ashamed of the name. I still carries it.
TD- Because of your relationship to the name your mother carried and the name your grandfather carried, and that identifies you as part of their family.
EMS- That's right, that's right. Because they was not Prentiss, they were born Cox. As he said, Ned Cox, it wasn't Ned Prentiss. He got that Prentiss from Sergeant S. Prentiss.
EMS:﻿13
TD: If he was born a slave, the name Cox was probably a slave name.
EMS: Of course.
TD: So that the name is what you make it.
EMS: That's right. Well, I'm not ashamed of it.
TD: Now, he did not serve in the war, and he hid when they thought that the Yankees or the Confederate soldiers would also...
EMS: Well, whoever it was that would come around on horses after the war had declared ended, you know what I mean...
TD: Oh, after the war had ended, the Civil War had ended...well, the Confederates lost. All right, therefore he was free at that time, but they didn't want the Yankees to tell him of his freedom?
EMS: No, that's right. They did not.
TD: Now at what point did the Polks come in and purchase the plantation?
EMS: Well, I guess they must have bought it from Sergeant S. Prentiss, they must have bought for little or nothing, a song and a dance, because he was hated too, down in...
TD:	Polk was.
EMS:	Mr. Polk was a despised man with those people...
TD:	Despised by whom?
EMS:	The rebels down there, they called him a damn Yankee.
TD:	Did the blacks ever call him a damn...
EMS:	Oh, the blacks loved him, 'cause he was good to them. We all loved him.
TD: Now, we do know that following the Civil War, when those plantations went
bankrupt, there were speculators who came from the North, who bought up the land and maybe Mr. Polk was one of those speculators.
EMS: Who knows? He was from the North. They called him a damn Yankee.
TD: Can you describe the house that was there on the plantation?
EMS: Yes, a great big house with about forty or sixty rooms.
TD: That's as big as the White House here in Washington.
EMS- Oh bigger, it was bigger than the White House here in Washington, with a
porch that goes all around. I think it was three stories high, or four. Bu when the war started for, what you call it, is that the Revolutionary War...
TD: No, the Civil War.﻿14
EMS: No, what is this other...the war before the...the Civil War, it never was finished, that's why the porches didn't go all the way around, they stopped. There was a tree there, a cedar, and when them cedars is little, small bushes, they call them cedars now, and I can imagine that old cedar tree, and I watched it and watched it and watched it grow from many, many years on the farm for at least...I didn't leave the place until the house was tore down and that old tree still stood there, old cedar.
TD: Oh, this old plantation house is no longer in existence.
EMS: No, they tore it down, building house for the tenants on the Polk place.
TD: Oh, is that what Polk did?
EMS: TD:
EMS: TD:
That's what Mr. Polk did. And built them decent houses.
Well now, as I understand it, Polk made it possible for the sharecroppers to purchase their own land.
After a length of time, he got tired of the farm, and he decided to sell it or what to go back to Vicksburg, because when he had this farm and Grandfather was the agent...
When Polk purchased the plantation, where was your grandfather living? EMS: I don't know.
TD: But when you knew him, he was living where?
When I knew my grandfather? He was living in Polk's big house.
Now was that house in existence at the time Polk purchased the plantation, or did Polk build that house?
No, that house was built when Mr. Polk bought that place.
EMS TD:
EMS TD:
TD:
And when Polk bought the place, he built a house and in the house were quarters for your grandfather?
EMS: Yes,
And he also made your grandfather overseer or agent.
EMS: Yes.
TD: What was his duties as an overseer, do you know?
EMS: Yes, he'd take care and have people to work his orchards and farm crops and fruit trees and his horses and the cattle they had on the farm.
TD: During slavery on this plantation, the crop was cotton, wasn't it?
EMS:
Yes.﻿15
TD: After Mr. Polk purchased it, it was no longer a cotton plantation?
EMS: Oh yes, 'cause he had a gin, oh yes, there was cotton fields. He had
people living on that, sharecroppers for the cotton fields. Then there was other people bought land...Mr. George Hawkins, I remember him very well. Now Polk place...the west side of Mr. Polk's plantation was George Hawkins's place, and on the east side of Mr. Polk's plantation was Mr. Albert Brown's place.
TD: Now was Hawkins and Brown white?
EMS: Yes, oh God, all...
TD: And were they damn Yankees?
EMS: No, they were damn rebels, we called it. Nobody's a damn Yankee but Mr. Walter Langston Polk. On the north side of Mr. Polk's place was the Newmans^s', Walter Newmans's place. He was white, and Mr. Polk was surrounded with enemies who didn't like Yankees.
TD: Well, what did they do to Mr. Polk that would classify them as enemies?
EMS: Mr. Polk would sit down, and I could hear him talk sometimes with my
grandfather, telling him he'd have to be careful, because those people didn't like him, and in the ending, they burned his gin down.
TD: Burned Mr. Polk's gin down?
EMS: Yes.
TD: Do you know what year that was done in?
EMS: I could tell you this, you get back, now you can kind of trigger this up. When Mr. Polk's gin got burned down, I imagine, please, I was about six years old. I was between six and seven years old.
TD: And you were born in eighteen...
EMS: Eighteen and ninety-three.
TD: Well, that would make it 1899 or 1900.
EMS: I think that gin got burned down eighteen and ninety-nine or eighteen and ninety-eight because, listen, 1900, I got a brother Charlie, my mother's son. I went to get the midwife for her, she said to tell the old midwife to come to see her at once. The gin was gone because I had to pass the stream of water to go get her, and again I noticed the gin, see, and the fire and all that part, and it was kind of freshly done. That creek where he had some pipes or another to run out of that for to get the water, he had built on the bank of the creek, we called it Polk's Creek. That dam that busted when I told you about my mother almost drowned, that's the dam behind Mr. Polk's gin, and it was burned down. And I imagine to give you the right estimate, about eighteen and eighty-eight or eighteen and eighty-nine .﻿16
TD: Well, wait a minute, that would be before you were born.
EMS: No, I'm talking about...I mean eighteen and ninety-eight, or eighteen and ninety-nine, I'm sorry. I remember the sparks, I remember...because my father, my mother's husband, had to sit on top of the house with tubs of water, buckets of water, where all them shingles would come in. It was so close to the gin, on the farm, to keep it wet, and to put out those shingles, to keep from setting our shack afire. I can't fofget it, I can't forget that. That's something that will stick with me forever.
TD: Well, and Mr. Polk felt that his neighbors had performed arson.
EMS: Yes, that's right.
TD: Well then, at what point did your father purchase land from Mr. Polk?
EMS: You mean...that was when he decided to sell to the people, and my father died in '32...well, I'm talking about my mama's husband, he died in '32. He died in '32, and he lived about two years, he died in '33 and he purchased it in '31. He died right behind the purchase of that land.
TD: Oh, in other words your grandfather never purchased any of the land.
EMS: My grandfather had purchased the land what he give his son Jeff.
TD: Oh, In other words, your grandfather, he purchased from Mr. Polk about how many acres?
EMS: Five hundred.
TD: Five hundred acres. That's a considerable amount.
EMS: Yes, be proud of him, they had children, sons...
TD: All right, and he willed all that 500...
EMS: Well, that was his and he lived there, he lived with his son, and his son helped him to pay for it, just like you...you know what I mean.
TD: Yes, it was a family operation.
EMS: Yes, he was living with his son Jeff, and Jeff had sixteen or eighteen children. His son Jeff.
TD: Now Jeff was the one who committed suicide.
EMS: No, he didn't. Lex...
TD: Oh, I'm sorry, Lex. In other words, Jeff was the next oldest, because the two oldest boys died in the war, we don't know what war.
EMS: No, we don't, I can't say, but they died in the war.
TD: And you remember seeing pictures of them.﻿17
EMS:	I seen the pictures of them, Quesie and Mat.
TD:	And those pictures were on the wall of your grandfather's home.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	You don't know whether those pictures were lost in a fire or not.
EMS:	I'm sure they were lost in a fire. I'm sure they were lost...
TD:	But as I understand, that they were in uniform, those pictures...
EMS:	They was in uniform, they was in uniform, they were handsome.
TD:	And they were young.
EMS:	Yes, yes. Young soldiers.
TD:	Did they die in combat...if they were in the service?
EMS:	I'm sure they did, I'm sure they did.
TD:	Is it possible they could have been in the Civil War?
EMS: It seem like it had to be in...whatever war it was, they got no pay, because they went on their own initiative.
TD: What do you mean, were they slaves that were drafted?
EMS: I don't think they were drafted, I think they just went.
TD: Volunteers.
EMS: I think they was volunteers, I think they were volunteers because the reason why I'm saying that, Uncle Jeff's wife, Mittie's father went, Jim Winston.
TD: He went at the same time...
EMS: And he got killed in it. This come from my mother. I don't remember Jim
Winston Jr.'s father, Sr., but I know Jim, Jr., because he's the one brought my mother when the water went down low enough. Why, she was stranded out there, his house was closer than we was, and he went out and managed to get in and bring her to his house, and then come on out and come to us. He brought her to us.
TD: I've heard this story of your mother at one time during the flood, who was threatened with drowning, so let's save this for a later date when we're talking about your mother.
EMS: But what I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you about his father, whose help brought my mother to me, is the one what got slayed with my two uncles. They were volunteers, see, that's what they told me. Now what could that been, was that the...
TD: Well, that was then...well, your mother told you, oh, his father, his father,﻿18
TD: (cont.) I see, because you didn't know his father...
EMS: No, I didn't...
TD: So it was a war that occurred before you were born, which could have been the Civil War.
EMS: It was a war occurred before I was born, 'cause I don't remember them.
TD: They died before you were born.
EMS: They were dead, she was telling me about the brothers and I saw the pictures of them.
TD: We had some Indian wars following the Civil War, but we didn't have the Spanish-American War, 'cause that occurred after you were born, so they were either in the Civil War or in the war with, what we call the Indian War.
EMS: I don't remember, I don't remember.
TD: Out west and all.
EMS: I don't remember none of them.
TD: Well, they could have been in the Civil War. Well, let's go back then.
Your grandfather purchased land from Polk, 500 acres, which he, together with his son Jeff, operated, and Jeff inherited those 500 acres.
EMS: Yes, and the family.
TD: You said, "and the family."
EMS: Jeff and his family.
TD: Jeff and his family. But your mother did not inherit any land from your grandfather?
EMS: No.
TD: And all the land that she would inherit would have been from her husband.
EMS: What they purchased, that's right.
TD: Now your mother was the youngest girl in the family, and she was born after the Civil War. In other words, you have listed all of the children that your Grandfather Monroe had. Did they ever have some children that didn't survive beyond infancy?
EMS: I couldn't tell you.
TD: Did he ever mention the fact that they buried some children that had died when they were very young?
EMS: I don't remember, I don't think so. He might have, but I wouldn't know.﻿19
TD: I see. The reason I asked is because he was a very valuable person, and the purpose of his marriage and all was to produce slaves. Evidently, the children were valuable so they were given excellent medical care. Did he ever mention that he had children which would have been sold from him?
EMS: I never heard him say it.
TD: In other words, either Whitaker or Prentiss never sold any of the members of his family?
EMS:	I don't think so.
TD:	He never mentioned.
EMS:	He never mentioned.
TD:	The other thing is, did they ever beat him?
EMS:	My grandfather? He said they never put a lick on him.
TD:	They never put a lick on him.
EMS:	He was a faithful servant.
TD:	That is talking about Whitaker and Prentiss,
EMS:	The whole bit. I never heard him talk how harsh...was on him, or whipped him or this or another, I never heard him say that.
TD: What about the food, did he feel that he was fed adequate...
EMS: Off the white folks' table, he said. He didn't eat with them, but after
the white folks eat, and the cook, his food was next. He ate off the white folks' table, what they ate, that's what he ate.
TD:	And presumably his wife did the same.
EMS:	I imagine so, I imagine so.
TD:	They would be called what the people nowadays call house niggers.
EMS:	They was.
TD:	In other words, they fared better than the field hands.
EMS:	Oh, indeed.
TD:	Well now, did your grandfather ever say he witnessed any beatings or acts of cruelty against the field hands, did he ever mention that?
EMS: No. He could have said that, he could have said that. But he never talked that with me. I can't answer that. I don't know.
TD: What was your grandfather's relationship to the white people outside of the immediate plantation?﻿20
EMS: Just an old beaten nigger.
TD: No, I didn't mean it in that sense. How did they regard him? Didn't the white people from adjoining plantations come for some of his work?
EMS: Oh yes, they thought he was a very excellent man. They respected him
highly because he was always humble, he had his sense and he had the know-how, he understood who he was and he understood he was a black man, and he respected the white people.
TD: In other words, his mores were such that he would call them "master."
EMS: Master, mister, and marster.
TD: What's marster?
EMS: That's master right on. He'd go marster more than he did master. Marster
Jim and Marster Whitaker, that was much more to him, it meant much more, and master. Master is something that we got in my time. In his time, it wasn't master, but marster. I imagine it could have been his language, how do I know. Marster Jim. I never heard him say Master Jim. Marster Jim. So I'm taking it for granted he was Master Jim.
TD: Now how did he call Mr. Polk?
EMS: Mister Polk.
TD: In other words, Mr. Polk never asked him to call him master.
EMS: He did not, he did not.
TD: After freedom though, he still called these white...
EMS: He never changed it. That's right.
TD: But Mr. Polk was a different relationship.
EMS: He was a different man 'cause he wasn't a rebel, he was a Yankee. And how I know he was a Yankee, 'cause I heard all the rest of the white people in Mississippi and different counties, Warren County and Cook County and whatever county, I forget, I don't know what county, I can't get all those county. I don't know. What I'm saying, was mister.
TD: Did you ever witness or hear tales of the lynching?
EMS: No, I didn't hear any tales or witness tales of the lynching. I saw charred bodies up against trees in Vicksburg on Clay Street. They were burned beyond recognition, and they said the body was a body of Jesse Dawt's brother, a colored man that attempted rape on a white girl.
TD: That was in the city...
EMS: Vicksburg, Mississippi.
TD: About how old were you then when you saw that?﻿21
EMS: I was seven or eight years old. We dare not to talk about it, we dare not to say anything, it was just there, what the gasoline...
TD: As a child, if you were seven years old, somebody must have told you.
EMS: My father, my mother's husband told me, I think it was.
TD: Told you that...he identified these charred bodies and the fact that...
EMS: Well, the people were talking...
TD: Attempted rape...a seven-year-old child does not necessarily know what attempted rape would be.
EMS: No. Because I doubt it seriously if they used the word rape back in them days.
TD: What word did they use?
EMS: I think they used the word that they insulted a white girl.
TD: I see. He insulted a white...insulting is a little different from rape.
EMS: I know, but he asked the question and insulted her, and we knew what that meant, because we didn't know the word pregnancy, what that meant. They were just saying that the girl had broke her leg, and I was so dumb, I looked to see was her leg broke. But her leg wasn't broke, but her stomach was setting out and that is the way, the language they used to us children. And my mother was very, very close-mouthed and would not tell us anything, education that we could pick up from. I didn't know, I guess she taught us like she was taught. And when old people would talk, those old people are gone, people were talking about what one child done and the other one done and had or got pregnant by, some of the relatives of that family and so on... They kept their mouth shut because it seemed to me since I got grown, pretty well all those people on that plantation are that one family. So and so's family was very, very much mixed up, one man was the keeper of all his sisters and things like that and getting children by them and things like that and keeping them out.
TD: Did you know any poor whites in the neighborhood, what they called poor whites?
EMS: Yes, I knew 'em, they called them poor trash and called them peckerwoods,
that was the name in my time. I think I got poor trash...peckerwoods would come out first, those peckerwoods.
TD: I think those names were sort of universal in certain parts...
EMS: Have you ever heard that name?
TD: Oh sure, redneck...
EMS: Rednecking peckerwoods.
TD: That's right, poor white trash. Now those were the names not only that the blacks used, the whites...﻿22
EMS: That's where I got the word, from the white people. And they said they
would rather any time, to sit down to the table with a nigger than to sit there with poor trash.
TD: Is there anything else that you would like to add about your grandfather
that you think would be of interest to your grandchildren, great-grandchildren or your children fifty years from now?
EMS: I think it's all gone and say, all said and done. That's as much as I
could think of and the question you asked me what I answered I don't know of any more value that I could add, what I haven't done, unless there's something else that you could think of, of a question that you think I could answer. But all that you have asked and all that I could think of. What I think I think I've said.
TD: I think I have explained to you, and I believe that it should be made as a matter of record, that all that you have said on this tape, you would be willing to have it released for research purposes at this time. Also what you said on the record in 1976 could be released at this time. It is our plan to give subsequent tapes, which would be of a highly confidential nature and would have restriction on its use. However, you have a granddaughter whom you would like to designate as your heir in the use of these tapes. Would you indicate who she is?
EMS: Her name is Ruette...
TD: How do you spell Ruette?
EMS: R-U-E-T-T-E. Ruette Madrice Watson. She's at Rutgers College, up in New
Brunswick, New Jersey. She is twenty-two years old, and she will be twenty-three years old April, wait a minute, is she March or April...oh God. when's her birthday?
TD: Well, her birthday would be, in other words next April she'll be twenty-three years old.
EMS: Yes.
TD: All right, then, I think that's sufficient, she'd be able to tell you what day of the month she would be. And she's in what year in school?
EMS: She's out, she's just working now with upper...seniors. She graduated this year.
TD: She graduated in 1977.
EMS: Yes, she did.
TD: But she's still working with the university.
EMS: Yes, they love her so well and she's such a smart student, and she knows the children so well, she's accepted and she's still working with them.
TD: And I believe this is the granddaughter who has traveled in Europe.﻿23
EMS: Right, she's the one. She spent her vacation in Europe, and besides she went to Europe before she spent her vacation, when she was in high school from Mays Landing, a traveling ambassador.
TD: And she was a musician also.
EMS: That's right, that's right, but she's studying electronics and all. She's a photographer and in movies and different things like that. Maybe I don't know because I'm not a college student, but she studies stuff like that and she loves it.
TD: And one more question, perhaps I should ask. How do you account for your talent in music. Was any other member of your family a musician?
EMS: Oh well, how do I account for mine? I guess, well, my grandfather, he played the violin.
TD: This same grandfather...
EMS Grandfather Monroe Prentiss.
TD: I'm still amazed at his talents.
EMS: He played violin, such tunes as "Turkey in the Straw" and ragtimes and jigs, and he'd have all his grandchildren over at Polk's big house dancing for what it's worth. He was just such a lovely person, he had all kinds of activities and things to teach us and love to see us do, and even until he was old, we would go and celebrate with him. After the old house, Polk's big house, was torn down and made houses for the people on the plantation of Mr. Polk, he bought and had a big house up there with his son Jeff, he still loved fun. He loved to play cards, he loved games, he never gambled, but for teaching us games and this and other like that, he always would amuse us in some kind of an activity that we'd be glad to go back...well, the end of the week couldn't come fast enough for us to go to see Grandfather. He was a lovely, lovable, expanse man and he was a good, good grandfather to all of his children. And for me, I thought there was nothing in the world could top him, my whole life based on him.
TD: Well, this certainly has been an enjoyable session and through you I've got to know your grandfather, and the more you talk about him, the more I admire him...
EMS: Thank you.
TD: ...and I would like to have been considered as one of his grandchildren.
EMS: Thank you so much. You are so kind, you are so very kind and to speak those kind words for someone who I love so dearly that it makes me love you more and more, 'cause them's the things which you have just said, what I want to hear, because that's true.﻿﻿INTERVIEW with ESTHER MAE SCOTT
Theresa Danley:
Esther Mae Scott:
Theresa Danley:
Esther Mae Scott:
Theresa Danley: Esther Mae Scott:
This is an interview with Esther Mae Scott, affectionately known as Mother Scott today is August 11, 1976. And the time is 3:45 p.m.
Mother Scott, you recognize me as Theresa Danley, and we've made this appointment to have a conversation. I understand that you were very busy this morning and that Reverend Don Howard, of the United Methodist Church, who heads up the Bicentennial program had you on one of his programs. What happened?
Well, I was very impressed indeed with him. First let me say, he knew you and he knew your husband. Told me you were swell people, and asked me did I know you. I said yes, and that's what made me love him after you had told me the story about him. And everything you told me about him was true. He's a nice person, he's a good man to work for. He's loving, he's kind and as a matter of fact, he took uS to the Justice Department after I performed, me , and my boys. Took us to dinner. And I was very much impressed.
But this is not the first time you've performed in a bicentennial...
Oh, no, no, no. Not for this year. And before the bicentennial, before '76, I performed in many places. But for this year, as far as I can remember, I think the first, I started at the Smithsonian. I think I worked, I'm not sure, yes, yes, I worked five days over there, at the Smithsonian.
That was part of the folk festival.
Um, hum, un hum, folk group. And I'm trying to think the name of the people who hired me, informed me to go there. Was...names is kind of hard, I'm getting old. But anyway...
Theresa Danley: Esther Mae Scott:
Well, maybe...
Charles, I'm trying to think, Charles, Camp is the one, Charles Camp and another man by the name of, I don't remember his name, J.J. somebody. But anyway, names is hard for me to remember, but Peter sure was﻿25
EMS:	one of them too. That was down at the city front, at the
Southwest Washington, first at the city before I went to the mass, and then to the mall next with Charles Camp, yes, it was like that.
TD:	And you've also performed recently at Columbia, Maryland?
EMS:	Columbia, Maryland. But before that it was Westminster.
TD:	And Westminster, Maryland.
EMS:	Westminster, that's right. Then after that was Columbia, then
after that, I was in Baltimore Saturday.
TD:	But this is not unusual for you even though this is part of the
bicentennial celebration. You have been performing for groups, colleges, and all, up and down the Atlantic coast from Boston to Miami.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	And also performed over television, and radio, see. Now when
did you first meet me?
EMS:	Darling, I think it was, I know I met you at the church, at St.
Stephen and the Incarnation. And I met you at the altar. And I consoled you, you was troubled seemingly about something, but anyway, I took to you and got on my knees with you at the altar, taking communion in the house of prayer at St. Stephen's. And I received you and said, "Let's be friends and let me feel as you're my sister or my daughter." And the child of yours, Theresa, was named for you. That's where I met you. That Sunday I will never forget as long as I live. Something about you was like a golden thread from heart to heart. And I don't have to guess we are friends, I know we are friends.
TD:	Thank you, Mother Scott. And I'll tell you the year. It was
in 1964.
EMS: You're so right. TD-:	And we met at the
EMS:	You're so right.
altar during a healing service.
TD:	That's right.
EMS:	You're so right.
TD:	And I was impressed with you. And I remember the first St.
Stephen's night, that I was there at St. Stephen's. And Zain Gordy with his precious "Twelve Days of Christmas," and how we were all acting out the part.﻿26
EMS: Yes.
TD:	And here I saw you, and I knew you were a senior citizen, and
I didn't know your age. But what impressed me was how you were enjoying yourself, and how you entered in the spirit of everything, how you were clapping and dancing, see.
EMS:	Well, I'll tell you, anything for love and beauty of people.
That's the only way I can see to prove to God that we love him. We haven't seen God as our belief, and that's the God in us, the way I see it. But as the Scripture said, good or bad, "Whatsoever you do to one of my little ones, you do it unto me." And to show to God that I'm grateful and thankful to things and good things that he has done for me, I've got to be good to his people. That's my promise to God, and not to man. And I intend to keep that until he calls me in.
TD:	Well, let's go back then to your early childhood, and see how
you arrived at your philosophy as of today, and what were the factors that helped you mold your character.
EMS:	Well, what motivated me to do what I'm doing now. It wasn't a
test, this was mercy. And I was at God's mercy when the floods of the Mississippi water... The dam broke, and my mother went to let the livestock out of the pastures. And the dam broke, like she said, she was going to let them out because she wanted the calves to get to high ground. She was afraid if that creek wouldn't hold the water, the dam would break. And all the stock would be lost. And just like she said it, it was. By the time she went to do this, about seven o'clock in the morning, I think I was about seven years old. Now you have to figure that yourself, if I was born in 1893, and I was about seven years old when that happened. And the dam broke, and it sounded like dynamite, a bomb or something. And we goes out of this little shack we was living in, in the lowlands of the Mississippi just in time to see the water catch her. And she was swift enough to make it to a post in the lowlands, and there she clung to that post, and finally, in ten minutes time, maybe quicker than that, the water was up near her neck. We had no boats, we had no way to get to her. We couldn't do nothing but ask for mercy. So the children that was old enough to understand said, "Mama is drowning and going to drown." I said, "She don't have to drown." They said, "Well, what can we do? There's nothing we can do." I said, "Yes, indeed, we can do something." They said, "Like what?" I said, "Call heaven." They said, "We don't know how to pray." I said, "Follow me." And down on my knees I fell. And I called heaven and asked God not to take her, to spare her.
And
in a jiffy, when I, just like I'm saying it, a branch come
^	. - *	t. _ 1.1:_______A«
And
/YIlQ J_Il ^ J---J '
along and landed at that post, drifted right at that post. she climbed up in it. And that wasn't high enough. But her head was above the water. On and on, when the water would come higher and higher, something else would come along and drift there,﻿27
EMS:	(cont.) Since I got to be grown, and seek Jesus, and found
out who He was how wonderful and how merciful He is, I can't praise Him enough. But thanks be to His name. I began to say she was climbing Jacob's ladder, every round went higher and higher. That's my decision since I got grown, and since I understand, because when I was young, I didn't know; I knew how to pray, and I always thought there was a supreme being above me. And I always thought there was a God somewhere, 'cause somebody besides man had to make the world, sun, stars and the flag and stripes, and I know that was out of man's power, and it still is today. And thank God, I seek to know, and I was interested enough in it, and I believe enough in it, and I got enough God-like in me, I know what it is now that He is the King, He is the Creator of all things. And I can't do enough, I can't praise His name enough, and I can't be good enough and kind enough to His creatures, 'cause I read the Bible and in the Bible it says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the Word was God and everything He made, He said it was good." He loved it and He blessed it. And therefore the way I can show myself that I love God, I got to be good to God's creatures. I care nothing about colors, I care nothing about nothing but his creatures. Anything that breathes, of a person, of a human being, I love it.
TD:	This was down in Mississippi.
EMS:	Mississippi, Warren County, Mississippi, on the W.L. Polk place
when I was seven years old. Yes, Ma'am.
TD:	And you were born there.
EMS:	Born in Warren County, Mississippi.
TD:	Mississippi, on March 25, 1893.
EMS:	Right.
TD:	Your mother was also born there.
EMS:	Yes, she was.
TD:
Now, did she know where her mother was born, or did she know her mother?
EMS:	Yes, she knew her mother.
TD:	Well, now she was born in 1867.
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	That meant that she was born free, not a slave.﻿28
esm:	No, she wasn't a slave. But she was born the year of the
surrender she said, 1867. That's right, that's right. But my grandmother, her mother was a slave.
■pD:	Yes. Was she born in Warren County?
EMS:	No, I think her, no, I don't have to think. I'm sure her
mother come from Africa.
TD:	Oh, I see.
EMS:	Her mother come over on the ship just like her father did. On
the Mayflower. That's what they said.
TD:	(Laughs) Her father came on the Mayflower?
EMS:	That's what...
TD:	Okay, that's fine, fine. (Laughs) I'm not going to ask you
his name at this point.
EMS;	You can if you want to.
TD:	No, well, we'll save that for later.
EMS:	Okay.
TD:	Now, your mother had fourteen children.
EMS:	She did.
TD:	And you were number seven of the fourteen.
EMS:	That's right, that's right.
Now, I did know one, your older sister, Clara, because I met her at St. Stephen's and the Incarnation.
Well, I went to Mississippi, and I got her after her husband died. And she had no one to stay with her, and I went and got her from Mississippi, sold out what she had and brought her here to Washington, with me. And she lived here with me ten years. She come here in '60, and she died in '70.
TD:	She was affectionately known at St. Stephen's and the Incarnation
as Aunt Clara.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	And she was very dignified, beautiful woman who everybody loved
who met her.
TD:
EMS:﻿29
EMS:
EMS;
TD:
EMS:
Well, my mother raised us to be truthful. She said it was no harm to be poor and no disgrace to be poor. But it was harm and a disgrace to be a liar. She say anybody could be poor.
TD:	What was life down there in Mississippi? At the time you were
born, you speak about the flood and all. What kind of a home did you live in?
EMS:	Well, I lived in a house, what you would call now, they said
shotgun houses, or straight house. Room, and a second room if you got children, and steps to go down the back, and a kitchen out on the ground, with a shed up over it, and stove, and build seats around 'it, shack, and things like that. It was called the slums and a shack.
TD:	That was the dining area out there in the kitchen, is that what
you're saying?
EMS:	Um, hum, un hum, the dining area, yes.
TD:	How did you maintain yourself there, did you have any, did your
father or your mother have any source of employment there?
EMS:	Well, we worked on the farm. It was all farmers.
TD:	Doing what? What did you do as a young child?
EMS:	Well, when I was five years old, I was the water carrier with
my brother, nine years old, to the people who was ploughing in manpower before the farmer, John Deere, and all that stuff.
TD:	Before they...
EMS:	Before that was...
TD:	Machinery, farm machinery...
EMS:	YeS.
TD:	it was all done by hand.
Yes we did it by hand. And clean, and cleaning up land, and cultivating land for to make it workable, so people could work and farm the land, raise cotton and raise sugar cane, and corn and potatoes and so on like that.
But your first job was to carry the water to the workers, the laborers there. Now were you paid anything or were your family.
I wasn't paid nothing for doing that.
TD:	Was there any school that you could attend?﻿30
EMS:	No, not then. Later on there was a school; Julius Rosenwald,
a Jewish fellow, put some schools out there for the Blacks. And we had one teacher, and the teacher would have the children who could say the alphabets or read and write, to help him with the children who would come to him. It was more than he could handle. That was the best we could do. And for my schooling, to go to school, we had cotton to pick... And if on the man's place, if Christmas come and you wasn't through with picking the cotton, when New Year's come, you had to start. So that was one week from Christmas to New Year's. And from then, if we could go and finish the cotton, picking the cotton and getting the crops and things, I say long in February, they started turning over land with ploughs and mules again. We had to get out there, and if I didn't carry water, I had to burn brush, or knock stalks—I cut down stalks with a hoe or something like that—and work. And I had no time for school much. I imagine to go to school I was grade, say about second grade.
TD:
ESM:
But it wasn't continuous. In other words, the most important thing, you followed the seasons of the crops.
EMS:	Right, the crops was more important...
TD:	That's right.
EMS:	Than schooling for us.
TD:	Yeah.
EMS:	Yes, yes.
TD:	How old were you when you first went to school?
EMS:	Well, I, I was say about six and seven years old, when they
build the school. I guess about seven years, maybe about a couple of years later from carrying water, because I remember before it was any schools. And then later on, I imagine about two years later, they had this school I'm telling you about called Clover Valley, Baptist school. That was the name of it. 'Course they got a church there named for the same thing. And I guess I went to school about a month in this season before, and no time before Christmas, because they're always late. Never was finished gathering our crops before Christmas. They're always... you'd go to school after Christmas, I'd say two or three weeks.
TD-	I heard you speak of the cold in wintertime, and how you had to
go in the kitchen with the dirt floor in your bare foot.
And not only in the kitchen with the bare foot, I had to go get the cows with the bare foot and get them up early. And then I'd have a chance to put my feet where they got up from, in the warm place, and warm my feet, because I had no shoes. And I﻿31
EMS:	(cont.) would get frostbitten sometimes, and I know my mother
would roast turnips and she would get them out, just like some people roast sweet potatoes, and put it open and stick it to my heels as hard as she could bear, and put socks on me. Sometime grandfather would give us socks, some white person give us socks or something for the children. And fix my foot, and wrap me up, and stop me from crying, because that's a miserable feeling. Your heels split open from the cold weather. And it's just miserable, let me put it like that, it's miserable.
TD:	That was the only medical attention you ever received, it was
just home remedies?
EMS: Yes.
TD:	You didn't see a doctor during...
EMS:	My heaven, no. The first time I was—my mother had no doctors
for all of her children. There was no doctors.
TD:	I remember Aunt Clara saying that she remembers when you,
Esther, was born because she on that day, her mother told she had to be the big girl in the family and get the dinner for the rest...
EMS:	That's right, that's right.
TD:	And she put on her mother's apron, which was so big for her,
it dragged on the ground. (Laughter)
EMS:	She told me that a many times.
TD:	No, also, I heard you tell stories about the pangs of hunger.
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	In your early years, did you ever suffer from hunger?
EMS: Yes, I did, many, many time. And the thing about being hungry, anybody can get hungry. But you say you're hungry, and there is nothing you can do about it, and nowhere to go and nowhere to turn to get it, that's where the dangerous part come in.
TD:	It's more than just missing a meal.
EMS:	That is right. That is right. And a many time I went through
things like that. I remember going to the briar patches with a stick—and we had some black molasses at home—and I'm telling the snakes, "You done been in the briar patches and got yours. Now get out the way and I'll get..." (Laughs) It's funny, now, I can laugh about it. I don't have to do that now. And pick some berries, and take 'em home and make dumplings, and put some﻿32
EMS:	(cont.) molasses in it, to see my brothers and sisters eat,
and how grateful they was to do that. They had a commissary on the store, Mr. Polk did. And if he didn't have what you wanted, you didn't have any money. In the store, what you had, what he had, you just got to wait 'til that supply come in. And we never did know when we got paid, and we never did know when nothing, because he'd just take it sometime and say you didn't come out even, you're still in debt, or something like that. And those ignorant people, they had no education. They didn't know the difference. That's the way my past was.
TD:
EMS:
TD; EMS:
EMS;
TD:
That's a form of serfdom, what we'd call, where you didn't get any pay> but y°u were forever in debt to the landowner.
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right.
TD:	Then...
EMS:
Then, that kind of food they'd give you, you'd know better than to get anything besides sourbelly for meat, or picklepoke. So I learned later that picklepoke was pickled horse meat. And if that was horse meat, we ate many a piece of it, and were glad to get it. To cook vegetables. Then they give us a little patch to make a garden. And we done our best with the garden, because that was the only source we had to get something different to eat, until my brothers grew up a little bigger. Then, we'd take sacks and chains, and put on that and go in the creek, low water, and sand, and catch fish. And finally, they got up big enough, some of the white people give 'em a gun, and they start hunting. And they get things. And we commence to surviving better and better and better.
TD:	As the children grow older.
EMS:	As the children grow older, yes.
TD:	And I assume your brothers didn't have any more schooling than
you had...
EMS:	No, that's right.
Because they had to help for the family. That's right. Not as much as I had.
TD:	Not as much as you did?
No, not as much as I did. No. Some of them didn't go to school at all.
Now what about recreation. When did you first learn about music and the playing of a guitar?﻿33
EMS:
Well, the guitar, friendly as I told you, this Suder boy was
unrVimr for mv unrip. _ .
working for my uncle,
TD:	Now, wait a minute, he's Kiser Suder.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	Spell his name.
EMS: k-I-S-E-R, Kiser, S-U-D-E-R, Suder. Kiser Suder. And he had a guitar, and it was all the guitar blues. We all wanted a guitar to play, so we couldn^t have but that one guitar, and I was boss over it with Kiser.
TD:	You were boss over it, with his guitar. And he taught you to
play. And yet you were the boss.
EMS: Yes, that's right. I come to be the boss 'cause he liked me. And he was just an easygoing fellow.
TD:	How old was Kiser?
EMS:	About eleven.
TD:	And you were?
EMS:	I'd say I was about eight or, eight, something old like that.
TD:	And the children were playing the music for what occasion?
EMS:	Well, you see, we'd been making music with jugs; and brooms,
you draw across your hand, make bass; and sardine cans what you make violins; and we had all kinds of crazy things going. And tin pans and rhythm, and that's what we would do. And oh, we'd have a ball doing that.
TD:	Who else in your family had this musical talent?
EMS:	Well, my grandfather, Monroe, Mam's father did. And he played
the violin. And sometime we lived in Mr. Polk's big house, on a Saturday night, that's where he lived because he was the caretaker of his crops and the overseer of what you call, over the other people, because he had a blacksmith's shop. And he would keep all the tools up, sharpen and beat out their thing so it would make it easy to sharpen up the tools for us to work with. And the plough for the men to plough with. That was the time before, like I'm telling you, before farm... Manpower was what we put out. The same tradition that my mother went through, after slavery—she was born the year of the surrender —we went through the same thing, her children did. Things wasn't any better. It was the same.﻿34
TD:
Let's move on a little faster. As I understand, you left home when you were about fourteen years old.
EMS:	I carried my age up. (Laughter)
TD:	Yes. You told them how old you were then.
EMS:	About sixteen.
TD:	And you were fourteen.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	And you were enticed to leave home because you wanted a what?
EMS:	Well, shiny costume that I wasn't able to buy! And I was just
like a proud peacock in it. I wanted to get in old Rabbitfoot and Woolcott's show.
TD:	Well, that, now let's get back now. Rabbitfoot and Woolcott's
show, those were two individuals and they were a traveling min£trel show, I understand, and...
EMS:	Right, right, right.
TD:	And medicine show also.
EMS: Right, right.
TD:	And they offered you employment and you told them you were
sixteen years of age.
EMS:	Right.
TD:	Did you get that pretty dress?
EMS:	Yes, I did. And didn't I perform in it and didn't I... Oh, but
I did. I thought I was the happiest and the biggest person in the world. And besides, I wasn't getting no dollar and a half a week. He paid a dollar a day.
TD:	That was big money.
EMS:	Big money! My mother, I broke her heart when I did it.
TD:	She, your mother didn't want you to leave.
EMS:	No, she didn't. So when I joined and did it, the first week I
got paid, I didn't touch that little money.. I brought every dime back to her, and explained to her why I left and carried my age up to join the show, so I could help her to get some things she really wanted.﻿35
TD:	And how did she accept that?
EMS:	She forgive me, and said, "Baby, I understand." And I asked
her, "Are you angry?" She said no.
TD:	Now what were your duties there at this medicine show? Tell us
something about medicine show because that is something we don't experience in this day and age.
EMS:	Well, they was just going around in, I think it was cars in that
time, yes, because the first car I remember was in 1906. I think that's when they come out down in Mississippi.
TD:	Well, if you were fourteen years old, that would be, let's see,
that would make it around, year, about 1906, yeah.
EMS:	The first car I remember, Mr. Quinn come out in it, Dr. Quinn
from Vicksburg. And I was out at the pump to get some water, me and my brother William. And I had a jug, because I used to fall down with the water all the time and they put a stopper, and that stopper was a boll, a green boll of cotton, a cotton boll in there so it wouldn't waste all, and I could handle it. 'Cause the bucket, I'd fall with it, me and the bucket all muddied up, and the bucket ruined and the water's muddy. But they give me a jug, and I looked down the road and saw this dust coming. And I thought it was the cows.
In that time, 1906, and back in 1900, Hardy used to take cattle from one place to another, to take 'em to a town where they ship 'em to some place for to make beef, a slaughter pen. They didn't put 'em in cars, and this and the other. They drive 'em through the country. And my mother always said, if you see a cloud of dust coming, make it to some place, a house or shack, and get under it, to be safe, because those animals, three and four hundred of those things, will stamp your child and kill him. 'Course there was plenty of children out there had been killed like that. And we didn't forget that. So I looked down the road that morning and saw that dust coming, I thought it was cattle. And I didn't hear no man hollering, "AAAuuugggh! AAAuuugggh!" 'Cause they used to make a noise and popping they whip. And thls thing is coming closer and closer. Now I look and saw this black thing coming. And no mules or horses, and nothing hitched to it. I took off like a jet. I thought the world was coming to an end. It scared me out of my wits. Off I made, from the pump, and well, I was in a more dangerous place than I would have been if I'd stayed down by the side of the road to see the car, because in that place was a marsh, water, copperheads, and I ain't seen nothing. Everything had to get out of the way for me, ' cause I was like a tornado. Baby, took off. And you better believe it. Scared me out of my wits, and my brother right behind me, in front of me once.﻿36
TD:	He was just as afraid as you were.
EMS:	Of course he was. Just scared to death like rabbits. We
stayed so long at the pump, my mother come to see what happened. And we hadn't drew up one drop of water. I didn't have any water in my jug. I don't even know where my jug was, because when I saw that car coming and looking poorly, I didn't—I'm saying car now because I know it was a car, then I didn't know what it was. And I just thought that maybe something was coming down for to get us, and the world was coming to an end. And take us some place. But whatever it was, it wasn't going to get me unless it got me out of that marsh because I was done took off. So my mother come looking for us, and she got round the pump, and she saw where the cockleburs and the weeds and things had been parted. She knew something big had went down there. She called, and we thought this was a thing come out of that car, that thing come down the road. And we wouldn't answer. And she said, "This is your Mama calling." And how dumb, "Are you sure you're Mama?" was the answer. "Yes, I'm Mama." And she said, "For heaven's sake, come out of that marsh." She said, "What was that went down the road?" We said, "It wasn't no cows, it wasn't no herds, we don't know what it was, something black going down the road, and people in it and honking, blowing horns," something or other like that. And she said, "Yes, I think some of the white folks told me some time ago that Mr. Quinn had bought a automobile, and I think that's what it is," she said. So, and I said, "Is he coming back to get us?" She said, "Oh no, he don't want you. He couldn't do nothing with you. Nobody wants you but me. And come on out." So we did. And we were sure it was her. "Where's the water?" "Well, go back and get the water." So we did. So she went with us to those thirsty people, to water those people. And we had been gone over an hour and a half, and they were sweating bullets. It was so hot. That's right. So, later we hitched up the mules and took the cotton that they had picked and what they had gathered. On our way home, this car come back up the road. It must have went over in Warren, in Hines County, somewhere way away, where the roads was very bad and dusty and ruts was in 'em. And he blew the horn again. So the mules didn't have any more sense than we had. (Laughter)
TD:	They started off.
EMS:	They started off, and I'm telling you, if we'd have come along
the Polk's Creek bridge up there, we all would have been drowned, because those mules was just as scared of that car as we was. And we all would have been drowned was in the wagon, because we had the wagon with the big sides all loaded with cotton what we had picked, and people, going home to Polk's big house. And the thing passed us. And I said, "That's the thing that come down the road." And Mama said, "No wonder." She wasn't used to it﻿37
EMS:	(cont.) either. She said, "Well, it would have scared me.
I can understand it frightened you all." I said, "Yes, it did." So that's the time I'm telling you about the car. So, now, in my time, that's 1906, when I was with the minstrel show, see, they was on these trucks, some kind of old big car, and that's what the tent and these performers was on, that's what we moved around on. And wagons with mules pulling 'em. But you see, Rabbit foot and them got a old truck and something or other, we could make faster time than we could with mules. And we didn't have to feed them mules. Just buy gas for the cars. So they was kind of popular then, back in, when I was about fourteen years old, and carried my age up. You understand what I mean?
TD:	Yes, I understand. Yeah, yeah.
EMS:	That's right, that's right. Because when the car first come
out, I was too young. I couldn't have told nobody that I was sixteen years old with the face I had on, because I was only seven years old. Something or other like that. That's right But now, I was saying, my performance...
TD:	About this minstrel show. What kind of performances did you give?
EMS:	We just give nothing but just songs, and dancing. Let me put it
like this, the most we did was lied. Because they said this Jack Rabbit liniment and Bentone liniment and hair pomade what they was selling—they only sold it to the black people. And it got every nickel those people would make, because they make pictures of people with pretty hair, and the black people wanted pretty hair, and get them kinks out straight. And they said if you put it on your head, it'll straighten your hair, and showed the pictures what it looked like. And every bit of it was lies, there wasn't no truth in it. Well, I was on that show. And I knew better, 'cause it was red devil lye, what you scrub with, was in that stuff, what they put in that hair pomade. And I'd come out and say, "Yes, it'll make hair grow on your head. It'll make hair grow on bald heads. It'll make hair grow on lamp posts, lamp lights, light bulbs," and things like that. And I knew I was lying. But I was telling as much truth as they was telling, but that's the way I had to make my living. And that's what I was doing for a living, I was getting a dollar a day to lie.
TD:	Well, as I understand it, you also demonstrated your own hair
as an example of what...
EMS:	I did. But that was the thing about it. By me being half-breed,
quite naturally my hair was floating and long and hanging. But that hair pomade didn't do that, I didn't put that stuff on my hair. (Laughter) I didn't put that on my hair. My hair was naturally real. But the hair, what the people what they's buying﻿38

EMS:	(cont.) for their hair, was curled up in kinks, and that's

what they wanted, hair like my hair.

TD:	Evidently, you were rather convincing. Didn't they know any

better, because they know that no hair grows on electric light
bulbs?

EMS:	Well, I know that. But the doctors told them that that hair,

that stuff would make hair grow on bald heads and this and the
other. And I was coming to add a little addition to it by just
being funny, to make the show funny, and dancing, and just say
it would make it grow on lamp posts and light bulbs...

TD:	Did you, well, did you take part in any of the dance that they

had?

EMS:	Oh yes.

TD:	And what about....

EMS:	Quite naturally, they couldn't hold me because I had a shiny

dress on. And I was old Miss, very beautiful I thought, that
proud peacock. I had something that I had a longing to get,
a shiny dress, a costume, and it happened to be pink. I guess
my weight was about a hundred and eighteen, a hundred and nine-
teen, and I wasn't bad looking.

TD:	No, I think you probably were very pretty.

EMS:	I think so too.

TD:	What was the name they called you?

EMS:	Big Baby.

TD:	Big Baby.

EMS:	Big Baby. Big Baby.

TD:	And did you also play any musical instrument then?

EMS: Um hum. They had guitar and different things. And what I had
learned on Riser's guitar, quite naturally, I played it. "Oh
Babe, Babe, please don't let me fall/If you do you won't have
no baby at all/We gonna have a good time, a hot time/In the town
tonight." (Laughter) Can't forget that.

TD:	Mother Scott, do you realize that you learned stage presence in

those days, in that minstrel show. You knew how to perform to
the audience to be convincing. I have seen you perform to
audiences up at the Washington National Cathedral...﻿39
EMS: Yes.
TD:	With thousands of people.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	I saw you in Louisville, during the Episcopal Church General
Convention.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	At their Cabaret Night. When you got up on that stage with that
orchestra, you had over a thousand priests and bishops marching around that room.
EMS:	(Laughing) Baby, I turned them on, didn't I.
TD:	With, "When the Saints Go Marching In."
EMS:	"When the Saints Go Marching In," I had, I turned them on, baby,
I mean it. And I been turning them on ever since. And before, wherever I go, and I've had as many as 72,000 people at the Pocono Mountains, up in Pennsylvania, out at a folk festival. And baby, I turned them on. I was up on that stand, and I got out there, and I said, "I didn't come out here for to, just to do all the singing. I come out here for the love, I come out here for you all to hear me. And let's have a good time. And come on people, children of God, and follow Mama." And baby, I'm telling you, we really had a good time. Oh yes, wherever I stop, it's a good time.
TD:	But that goes back to your early days with this minstrel show,
and medicine show. But in addition to all of that, you stayed with them for about two years. And then you formed a friendship with Bessie Smith.
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	in Clarksville, Mississippi.
EMS:	Yes, I did.
TD:	And she was a friend of Leadbelly.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	Yes.
EMS:	So I asked the people that I went up there with, 'cause the children I take up —
TD:	That was when you became employed by this family.﻿40
EMS:	...help, that's right.
TD:	They were the Klauses, Ed Klaus.
EMS:	Ed Klaus's family, that's right, that's right. Did they own
catering. One or the other, and the cousin, Mannheimers and Laudenheimers and all those people together was, I guess they were runaways from Russia, from Germany, 'cause he was a German Jew. He was Hebrew, Mr. Klaus was. Well, anyway, that Saturday I had been working so good, that Friday rather, and I asked them, "Miss, could I go to Clarksdale to see Bessie Smith? I did always admire her." And they talked about it among themselves, and they finally said well, I'd been so good, and such a good maid, "Yes, you may go." I said, "That'll be my vacation." And they told me, "Show up Monday."
TD:	Just the weekend, that's all. Well, you were working seven
days a week then?
EMS:	All the time, sweetheart. I'm trying to tell you, we didn't
have no weeks. The world go round, and the weeks go round from can to can't, when you could see until you couldn't see. We called it from can to can't. Nobody give you no time off. And besides, I wasn't at home where I could go to my little shack. I was off with them, and they's having their vacation and fish frying and having a good time. And there was nothing for me, but stuck. But her brother's, Sam Klaus's, maid said she would keep the children and my two boys that I was nursing, was very fond of her and agreed. If they hadn't agreed, I wouldn't have got off then. But they agreed. And honey, I was scared to look back when I left, 'cause I thought they may call me. You talk about leave here running, chance is you may ride... Baby, I left there running, going, me and Leadbelly. I said, "If you don't get me out the way, they'll change their mind and call me back. Let's go." And we didn't waste no time, and on to Clarksdale. We got in his car and off we went.
And when we got to Clarksdale, we met Bessie. And I was telling Bessie how much I thought of her. She didn't believe me. Bessie was the kind of a person, she drinked all the time. And she just believed everybody was after her boyfriend, which I was proud— there wasn't a thing I wanted but her voice. I just wanted to learn her songs and to hear how she sung and hear how she performed. And on and on, I made her know that I meant it and I was on the square with her. That was all I wanted, was her songs. And I idolized the "Gulf Coast Blues." And I got it down pat enough when Linda Hopkins come here to Washington and was playing down at the Ford Theater portraying Bessie and she made a mistake and asked me up on the stage with her. And I got up there and stole the show from her. 'Cause I told...﻿41
TD:	I'm sure of that.
EMS:	I told here I knew Bessie, I told her I knew Bessie before she
was born, and I did. And I got up and sung the "Gulf Coast Blues" what is on my album now. That's right, that's right.
TD:	I want to go, move ahead. How long did you stay with this white
family?
EMS:	Twenty-seven years! The Gotthelds. Twenty-seven years.
TD:	And you moved up and down the coast, when they traveled, you
traveled with them, spending summers up in Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard.
EMS: Yes, Yes.
TD:	Going down to Florida.
EMS:	Biloxi, Florida and every place else they went, I was with them.
Yes.
TD:	And raised their two children.
EMS:	To be men. One of the children is in Yazoo City now. He got
grandchildren. And the other one lives in Jackson, Mississippi. He got grandchildren.
TD:	But now, that relationship after twenty-seven years terminated
in, what did you say it was, in 1938, I believe.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	That was during the heights of the depression.
EMS:	That's right. Right.
TD:	And who terminated that relationship?
EMS:	She did. She said she was going to move to a hotel and she
couldn't use me anymore. The children was out of school. One boy was out of school, and the other was in school, the baby child, Ned. And she couldn't use me anymore. And she said, "If you want to, you can go back to, you can go back to Cary, on my brother's plantation, if you want to."
TD:	Back to Mississippi.
EMS:	Yes. Yes. And I...
TD:	Did you...﻿42
EMS:	And I told her no I didn't want to. I'd rather go out and try-
to make it myself, on my own.
TD:	After twenty-seven years of employment...
EMS:	Yes?
TD:	Did she offer you a pension?
EMS:	No. And besides that, they didn't take out no social security.
TD:	There was no social security in those days.
EMS:	Well, I know, but when it was social security...
TD:	She, well, domestic help was not covered by social security
back then.
EMS:	Well, maybe it wasn't. But I'm just saying, nowhere I've ever
worked didn't offer me even social security.
TD:	Did she give you what we call, severance pay, at the time she
told you your services would no longer...did she pay you for a couple of months in advance for when you didn't collect?
EMS:	(Laughs) I started to ask you was you sick with the heat.
She ain't offered me nothing.
TD:	Except to go back to Mississippi.
EMS:	Go back to Mississippi, if you want to. That was her answer.
TD:	You elected not to go.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	All right. Now, we'll move up a little faster. You came to
Washington in what year?
EMS: '38.
TD:	You came right after, you came to Washington? I thought you
went to Baltimore before you came to Washington?
EMS:	I come to Washington first in '38. That's where my daughter,
Ruth, my baby child was, here in Washington. Nineteen and thirty-eight. I stayed here a week on my way to Baltimore because she sent for me to go to Baltimore...
TD:	Who's she?
EMS:	Miss Gottheld, Adele Klaus Gottheld.﻿43
TD:	Yeah.
EMS:	Merty Landau Shoemaker lost her mother, 'cause when I was in
Mississippi, if you was a maid for one of those Jews, you was a maid for all of 'em. She turned me a loose, and let me go long enough to go to the hospital, and to get this baby and the mother in Martin's Hospital on Harrison Street. And I brought Merty home with Mrs. Landau, and stayed there on South Street with her, one was in the Pioneer apartment, the other in an apartment I guess is about the distance from here cross over to the other building. And when you worked for one, you worked for all, if you was a good maid. They don't want but that one. And they'll work you to death, night and day. So I stayed with Merty's mother, and brought her from the hospital when she was ten days old, and stayed with Merty till Merty was up with Ned and Harold. They was cousins. And after she got rid of me, and went to the hotel, Mrs. Gottheld did, Merty lost her mother in Baltimore, and said, "I want you to send Esther to me here in Baltimore." And that's what Mrs. Gottheld did, sent me to her, after I wouldn't go back to Cary on the farm.
TD:	Yeah. Well, now, when that relationship was terminated, with...
EMS:	Un hum.
TD:	What year was that? That's when you came back to Washington.
EMS:	I come back to Washington.
TD:	Yeah.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	Now in that period, no time were you interested in earning a living as an entertainer or musician?
EMS:	No. I had laid all of that aside. I had laid all of that aside.
I was nursing. I was domestic working. And I was cooking.
TD:	And how old were you when you picked up the guitar again in
the church?
EMS: Well, it, the time had passed, I guess thirty-five or forty years or longer.
TD:	Well, I meant how old were you at the time. Here you were faced
with no employment and you had to, you had a feeling of independence. You wanted to make it on your own.
EMS: I did.
TD:	And you went back to...﻿44
EMS:	I did, and I went back to my guitar.
TD:	That's right.
EMS:	That was my old stand-by, and what I...
TD:	But what I'm trying to say, you had...
EMS:	What year?
TD:	Yeah, no, not the year so much as how old were you? You were in your sixties or seventies, when you decided that.
EMS:	I was in my seventies.
TD:	In your seventies.
EMS:	It was in my seventies.
TD:	And you came at a period when the church was interested in
folk music, a part of the liturgical mass.
EMS: Right.
TD:	And St. Stephen's and Father Wendt and all promoted you.
EMS:	That's right. That is right.
TD:	And f rom then on...
EMS:	I had my first guitar, my own guitar, I could call my own, at
St. Stephen and the Incarnation, and Father William A. Wendt told me, "Get out and go down to Pogoe's and get you a guitar. And you get out on your own because you got enough talent. You're wasting it. And get out and make you some money."
TD:	Now, here you are in your eighties, with a whole new career
behind you of ten years or more.
EMS:	Right, right.
TD:	You have independence. However, at the same time, another
problem has come up. Physical one. How many times have you been to the hospital in the last two years?
EMS:	I been to the hospital twice in the last two years, and both
times it was for the same thing but on a different eye. He operated my eyes, Dr. Henry Wicker did. I had glaucoma in both eyes, and one eye was just about totally blind. And he said to me, "I hate to say this 'cause you don't like doctors, and I don't know the reason why." I said, "I can tell you the reason why. Because you go to a doctor and you ain't sick,﻿45
EMS:	(cont.) when you leave 'em, you're sick" (Laughter) I
never seen it fail in my life. You can go in there, and ain't nothing hurting, but when you come back, something hurting. And I said, "You doctors do something. I don't know why, but you do. And that's why, it ain't 'cause I don't like doctors. I love people. But I just don't like what you stand for." So he said, "Well, you got to go to the hospital." And I said, "Well, that ain't no news to me. I have already seen that. When, what time, and what hospital?" And I just looked like I stunned him. He said, "Are you sincere?" I said, "From my heart." I said, "Because God have already showed me that. And you is the one to do it. Just tell me when, where and what time." And I'm so glad, and I'm so glad and proud to say this, when I went to that hospital, to go in, to be check in, you Danley, took me and did it.
TD:	That's right. That's how I know so much about it. And also,
I know when I went up to visit you, you were not in that room, in that bed 'cause you were up and down those hospital corridors, in other patients' rooms, entertaining.
EMS:	Entertaining the other sick people, because I thought it was
my duty. I did not know how to act in the hospital. I acted in the hospital just like I would act, and I'm going to act the same way when I get in heaven.
TD:	(Laughter) Anyway, also in addition to your glaucoma, you've
had diabetes which means that you've been on a restricted diet. And you've had high blood pressure, and the doctor has forced you to reduce.
EMS:	And I have done that.
TD:	You've been forced to wear support hose.
EMS:	I've done that.
TD:	And you, in addition to that, you have, while you receive,
you're a member of the musicians union, and when you entertain over radio and television, you receive the union wage, but most of this work that you've done for the church, has all been a gift.
EMS: A gift. That's right, that's right.
TD:	What you performed today, you received no pay for.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	You are receiving social security, and you are eligible to buy
food stamps.
EMS:	Yes.﻿46
TD:	You live in this one-bedroom apartment, which seems to be
fairly comfortable. However, it's a neighborhood where it's dangerous for you to go out in the street.
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	You have been mugged.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	When you take your social security check to the bank to have
it exchanged for cash, which you have to take to the place to get your food stamps, because it has to be paid for in cash, you have to depend upon friends and church members to take you.
EMS:	To take me, that's right.
TD:	You cannot go and use public transportation because of your
difficulty in moving.
EMS:	In walking, that's right.
TD:	You can't take your guitar out in the street. You've had two
guitars stolen from you.
EMS:	That's right, that's right.
TD:	And uh...
EMS:	They would take my guitar away from me, I was in the street.
And Roy and I couldn't catch 'em. There was not a thing I could do about it, nothing.
TD:	Your social security check does not cover your, but a small...
there's no—after you pay your rent and your utilities, there's just a small amount left over.
EMS:	Thirty-one dollars left for me to live on.
TD:	So it's necessary for you to go and eat at the church with the
government program for senior citizens.
EMS:	That's right, that's right.
TD:	Medicare pays for your medical treatments when you have to go
for physical therapy treatments...
EMS: Right.
TD:	Twice a month. You've had all of your teeth removed. You've
had extensive dental care.
EMS: Yes.﻿47
TD:	Things, there are little things that you would like to see.
You would like to have those beautiful dresses that you left home for when you entertained.
EMS: Oh yes, those beautiful shiny dresses.
TD:	And you would like to change your costumes often.
EMS: Yes.
TD:
You have a granddaughter who's juggling to try to go to college under, with very little or no financial help.
EMS: Right. TD:
You'd like to help her. You'd like to go to see certain shows. You spoke about seeing Linda Hopkins at the Ford Theater. But that was a guest ticket, wasn't it?
EMS:	That's right
TD:
Well, you told me you would like, you would have loved to have seen Pearl Bailey. And you would have loved to have seen Bubbling Brown Sugar and Guys and Dolls, but it meant that somebody had to take you...
EMS:	Had to take me.
TD:	And all. So there's a lot of things that you would like in
your old age. There is no tomorrow. There's no future.
EMS:	Nope. One today is worth two tomorrows.
TD:	And you have not told all of your life history. You've not
told us all of your ancestry. You've hinted a little.
EMS:	That's right. That's right.
TD:	I have, and what information you've given out has been the sort
of Hollywood publicity stuff. It isn't always the truth.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	You realize that this tape is being made for people who are
historians, who want to know the truth.
EMS:	Right, right.
TD:	But also you would like from them some kind of assurance that
you would have some of the little things that would make life a little easier for you.﻿48
EMS:	Oh, I'd be so happy. I would be so happy.
TD:	And it is a traumatic experience to go back and recall days
that were very, very painful, very painful.
EMS:	Yes, yes, yes.
TD:	And it is upsetting, especially in your age, when your philosophy
is entirely different. You want to love people. You don't want to recall the hateful things that were done to you.
EMS:	Mmmh, mmmh, un hum. I don't want to think about that.
TD:	And at age eighty, you composed a song that is a favorite for
me...
EMS: Yes.
TD:	And a favorite for all senior citizens...
EMS: Yes.
TD:	I've heard you perform that song.
EMS:	Would you like me to play that for you?
TD:	I'd love it. And I think it would be nice on tape.
EMS:	Oh thank you so much.
TD:	And this was done when you were age eighty.
EMS:	That song was recorded and I made it when I was seventy-nine.
They wanted to know how did I feel, I was entering in my eightieth year. That song now, well, it's already four years old. And I'd love to play it for you.
TD:	Okay.
EMS:	All right.
TD:	Let's start.
EMS:	(Sings, accompanying self on guitar)
If you strike a thorny rose, Keep a goin',
If it hails or if it snows, Keep on goin',
T' ain't no use to sit and whine, When the #ish ain't on-your line. Bait your hook and keep on trying Keep a goin'.﻿49
EMS:	(cont.)
If the weather kills your crops, Keep a goin' Though it's work Keep a goin'.
Suppose you out of every dime Getting broke ain't any crime Tell the world you're feeling fine Keep a goin'
When they said it all is up Keep a goin'
Drain the sweet milk from the cup Keep a goin'.
See the wild birds on its wing Listen to the bell sweetly ring If you feel like singing, sing Keep a goin'.
Know why? Takes you longer to wear out than for you to rust out.
(Sings) If a task is once begun Keep a goin'.

Be the labor great or small Do it well or not at all
Answer your name when the roll is called Keep a goin'.
It's all I'm saying Keep a goin'.

Mother Scott, let's begin with your grandfather, his name and what you know about him.
Esther Mae Scott:
Theresa Danley:
Esther Mae Scott:
Theresa Danley:
Esther Mae Scott:
Well, his name was Monroe Cox, so he said. But how he got to America, as he told me, he was smuggled over here from Holland on the Mayflower.
Just a minute. Smuggled, that means he did not come on a ship with other slaves.
No, he was smuggled, his family, his sisters, and other brother was smuggled, he said, over here on the Mayflower. I don't know whether it's the first or second or third or what... I'm satisfied to know what he said to me, that he was smuggled over here from Holland on the Mayflower. They were crammed in the hulls of ships, and if you got sick or something else from being overheated or whatever, they would throw you overboard to the fish.
Did he indicate a date? How many slaves were on this Mayflower with him?
Well, he said it was quite many. He said they were in the hull of the ship like sardines in a can.
Theresa Danley:
The reason I'm asking these questions is that the Mayflower that brought the Pilgrims﻿2
TD: (cont.) from Holland was many centuries earlier and it hardly could be
that ship, so therefore it would have to be a ship that carried the name Mayflower at a much later date. The other thing is we do know that a yacht won a prize in the 1880s for international competition, so we know that a smaller craft was named Mayflower. The other thing is that word "smuggled" tells a lot because, after 1807, Congress passed a law making it illegal to import slaves, and in 1820, the death penalty was established for bringing in slaves illegally to the United States shores. So the fact that he was smuggled in indicates that it was an illegal operation.
EMS: That's right. He said smuggled.
TD: And they probably could not carry too many at one time if they were having an illegal operation.
EMS: Right. Right.
TD: Also, did your grandfather say anything about his life in Holland before he got on board this ship?
EMS: Yes, he said he was a blacksmith.
TD: Yes, in other words did he learn the skill of a blacksmith in Holland?
EMS: Yes.
TD: Now, that is also important because history tells us that slavery had
existed in Europe a long time before it existed in the United States, and the fact that he was directly brought from Holland would indicate that he was a slave in Holland.
EMS: Yes, he was.
TD: Those are the things that you and I are sort of exploring. Now, let's get
the period of his age. I think you can identify the date of his death; when was that?
EMS: He died in 1912.
TD: Where?
EMS: On the farm that he bought from the Polk place, what he give his son Jeff, one of his sons because he lived, Uncle Jeff, nineteen and twelve. It seemed to me like it was sometime in...it was a warm month, it had to be July, June or something like that, nineteen and twelve.
TD: How old was he then, did he say?
ESM Yes, from the way he give his birth, I think he died at the age of eighty-seven. . .
TD: He died at the age of eighty-seven.
EMS: Eighty-seven, eighty-six or eighty-seven, as far as I can remember, and I'm﻿3
EMS: (cont.) not too sure if it was eighty-six or e'ighty-seven years. I
could find out if I could go out on the farm, exact the year, but I'm sure it was...
TD: If he was eighty-seven at the date of his death, that meant that he was born in 1825.
EMS: I think you're right, something like that, yes.
TD: And that would be the estimate he made of his birth, and that he was born in Europe...
EMS: He was born in Africa, someplace in Africa.
TD: Oh, he was born in Africa then...
EMS: Someplace, yes.
TD: But you don't know the place in Africa.
EMS: No, I don't know exact the name of the place, it was somewhere in Africa.
And beside, I never thought that the time would come that I would have to tell or to talk about this, to give some reference of him and asking questions. I just thought I want to know, as I was always, they call...when you're smart and exploring, they don't call it that in my time, they called it nosy or something like that. And they wasn't much, particularly the older people, to tell you anything when a child would ask questions. But now, at times since I have grown up to be eighty-four years old myself,' I know what it means, and I wished I would have had the meanings or the...let me put it like this, the knowledge then that I have now. I really would have known, I would have asked everything that I possibly could, because I never would have thought the time would come that learning and asking questions, as you call it, and exploring would be so important.
TD: Of course, we all have those regrets, too, that we didn't ask more questions when we were younger, and it makes the research harder because of our lack of knowledge. Now what did he look like? Maybe his racial identity can be clearly pinpointed if we can have a description of his looks. What color was he?
EMS: Well, he was brown. He wasn't a real black man. He was brown, I would say something of an Indian color.
TD: What about his features? His lips, were they thick?
EMS: No. He had no big, thick lips, you can see, because looking at me and I resemble my mother, I've got her features and she had his features. As the rest of the children said, she was just more like him than any of them, and I'm like my mother.
TD: I presume you do not have a picture of him.
EMS: No, we did have a picture of my grandfather, but unfortunately the house burnt down in the country, out on the Polk place. You know what it mean when a house catch on fire, the shacks what they build for the colored people﻿4

(cont.) to live in, so we was lucky to save my mother. She was trying to save other valuables, things like that, but when they woke up, the house was on fire. It caught from the flue in the kitchen and all of it was connected, this kitchen with no floor in it at that time, and nothing but just boards and shingles, and it went up like paper.
What was the texture of his hair?
His hair was not kinks, it was not kinks. It was between, I would say, it was not straight and it was not kinks. It was a grade of hair that you could comb and it wouldn't curl up, it wasn't kinks. And he had, I'd say, a fair grade of hair.
Did he know anything about his parents?
Yes, yes, he knew his mother and he knew his father. His mother was named Phoebe and his father was named Ned, and so he said was Cox, Ned Cox.
I presume they had died before he came to the United States?
I don't know whether they had died or whether they had been sold for another ship and came over to America or went other places, sold as slaves.
Now you mentioned his brothers and sisters. Did the whole family come over on the Mayflower at the same time?
I don't remember asking him anything about any other brother but one. And that's the one who come over here, his name was Jeff, he named his son for Jeff.
And Jeff was...where did the other sisters come, he had sisters...
He had sisters, Adeline, I imagine she was Adeline Cox, I saw her, Manda, Phoebe. I think them was the three sisters I remembered that was over here.
But how did they come?
With him.
In other words then, you imagine that the whole family came over on the Mayflower?
What was left. Yes, I imagine so.
And that would leave the parents behind, as you say that...
Or else went on ahead, you know slaves are slaves, people are being sold, they go to another state to work or wherever they were sent...
He was adult when he was smuggled in.
Yes.
So that we will assume that he was roughly speaking, at least twenty years﻿5
TD: (cont.) old.
EMS: And I imagine he was looking after the other part of his family.
TD: Was he the oldest?
EMS: Yes.
TD: He was the oldest, and as I understand, when they arrived in the United States, they were purchased by whom?
EMS: My grandfather, Monroe Prentiss, was purchased by, was bought by Sergeant S. Prentiss. His brother Jeff was bought by a man by the name of James Buchanan.
TD: Now was there any relationship between Sergeant Prentiss and James Buchanan, or did they have adjoining plantations?
EMS: I couldn't tell you, I couldn't tell you about the plantations, I couldn't tell you anything about when they were bought or what relationship they had. But I'm just saying the two brothers would get together, and I'd ask questions, only on Sundays because they both worked.
TD: History is now telling us after Emancipation, after 1860, families who had been separated during slavery made every effort to get back and get in touch with each other. Is there anything that would indicate that Monroe and Jeff were separated during slavery, but met after Emancipation?
EMS: I imagine so, because they met, and I'm sure they lived close together on...plantation, because some of the farmers out there owned the farm. Grandfather was living on a Mr. Whitaker's place, what he called Marster Whitaker.
TD: Now what would the relationship of Marster Whitaker be to Sergeant Prentiss?
EMS: I couldn't tell you that either. I don't know how he come about it, unless Whitaker got him from Sergeant S. Prentiss, I don't know.
TD: Now, Monroe married...
EMS: A lady, my grandmother, by the name of Agnes Jane Garrett...
TD: And also you know who her parents were.
EMS: Yes, because my grandfather told me. Her parents were supposed to have been Colonel Garrett's daughter.
TD:	In other words, he was the white slave owner...
EMS:	Yes. And her mother, my great-grandmother, was named Fanny.
TD:	Fanny.
EMS:	I don't know her last name, but anyway, she was grandmother, Agnes Jane﻿6
EMS: (cont.) Garrett's mother.
TD: Now how did Monroe meet Agnes Jane?
EMS: Through the white people there. To be a man who would, for children, to
grow up children and raise slaves and he was a good, we'd say in the past, a good stud man.
TD: A good stud man, yes.
EMS: A good stud man for family, and they took very good care of him because they said he looked like the man was qualified, I don't know why, but that's what my grandfather said, that they were put together to raise families for slaves.
TD: In other words, the slave owners arranged that they would be put together so that they could have children which would be slaves.
EMS: Yes.
TD: All right. Now, do you know how old your grandmother was?
EMS: Well, I don't know exactly how old she was, I couldn't tell you very much about my grandmother, but you can picture this: my grandmother, Agnes Jane Garrett, died when my mother was eight years old.
TD: You have your mother's birthdate...
EMS: Oh yes, my mother was born at eighteen and sixty-seven.
TD: So we can then estimate that Agnes Jane died in 1875, approximately.
EMS: All right.
TD: That of course was after the Civil War. Now how many children did Monroe and Agnes Jane have?
EMS: Well, to my remembrance, two sons died in the Army, they was buried under military orders, and I can call the names of the children that my mother told to me, and I can call the names of the sons and daughters that I really did see. I saw all of the children except Mat and Quesie, that was the name of...that was the name my mother give me of her brothers that died in the service.
TD: And you presume those were the oldest children?
EMS: Yes, they had to be, because as I remember now, I remember meeting Lex; I remember meeting Fanny, that's a daughter; Alice; Indiana; Bill, his name was William, Bill was his short name; James, which is Jimmie; Mary was the baby child, that's my mother, Mary Liza; and John was the baby boy.
TD: You have also Jeff.
EMS: Jeff, that's right. I don't want to miss Jeff 'cause he was one of the﻿7
EMS:	(cont.) children. I'm telling you who I met, you count.
TD:	I haven't got Jimmie listed.
EMS:	Well, Jimmie was one of the children.
TD:	Yes, but when you talked with me earlier, you hadn't mentioned Jimmie.
EMS:	Jimmie was Grandfather's son.
TD:	Yes, I understand.
EMS:	And my mother's brother. I know him, Jimmie Prentiss.
TD:	So he lived to be an adult.
EMS:	He just died back here...he hasn't been dead over thirty years, he hasn't been dead over thirty years...
TD:	He married?
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	And what was his wife's name?
EMS:	Pinky.
TD:	And they had children?
EMS:	A gang of them.
TD:	I believe that you said that John was the one who was born after your mother. And your mother was born in '67, which was after Emancipation.
EMS: Yes. She said she was born the year of the surrender. Well, what year was that?
TD: Well, I guess '67.
EMS: That's the way she said to me, she said, "I was born the year of the
surrender," now you have to help me to look that up and things like that, 'cause I'm not a great scholar.
TD- So we know she was born free, and John, who was born afterwards, was born free. Now were any of the others that were older, like Fanny and Alice, were they born after 1860?
EMS: After 1860, oh no. My mother was younger than them, they was bom before eighteen and sixty.
TD: That's right. But what I'm trying to say, were all of the others born slaves?
EMS: It could have been.﻿8
TD: I don't want you to assume anything. Now, as you say, you've listed all those that you knew...
EMS: I knew them, the names that I'm giving you I saw.
TD:
TD:
TD:
EMS:
Now did they all live on the same plantation, this Polk Plantation?
EMS: Yes.
TD: So that's how you were close to them. EMS: Yes.
Now let's go back to your grandfather's occupation. You say a blacksmith. To people today, a blacksmith is a person who makes shoes for horses, but from what you tell me, he did more than just that.
EMS: He did, he did. He made wagons that was pulled, drawn by oxens.
TD: Now these wagons were wooden.
EMS: Yes, they were wooden wagons made from very strong trees, like white oaks and'hickory and ironwood trees that you can get in the country. Because I remember the names of many trees, I helped to clear up just for so many years for the Polk Plantation down in Mississippi in Vicksburg.
TD: Now that assumes that he was more than just a blacksmith, he was a carpenter.
EMS: He was a carpenter, he made chests, chest of drawers, wagons, rakes, spades, shovels. . .
Now let's see, these tools, rakes, shovels and all, have iron parts...
Yes, he would get this scrap iron and get together and shape it up in his fire or melting pot or whatever he had, because I was the little girl who would blow the bellows for him in the ship on Saturdays and Sundays. There was candy for doing that, that jelly bean candy and...
TD: About how old were you when you helped him?
EMS: When I would help him, I'm sure I was six and seven years old and five.
I had to get up on a stool that he cut out of pine tree, and made a stool high enough level—and a big tree—that I could stand up on and get to those bellows and blow it. The coal would be in there, and when I'd go up and down like a seesaw pole, that air from that bellows would liven up the charcoal, and he'd have his leaded plow points and his iron and different things and he'd get it real hot. I remember on another stool he had tubs there with water in it, and he had his fire tongs and everything what he made...
TD: He made the fire tongs. EMS:
Yes and when it would get hot, he put handles on them so the iron would be hot' but the handles he could handle with gloves. He'd get it hot enough for'to take his sledge hammer to beat on it, I remember that on the anvil.﻿9
EMS: (cont.) He would run to the water and get it hard and stick it in the water, and the steam would come up, and I watched all that stuff. Oh, if I could just have the imagination, just only had the knowledge then, what a beautiful story I could tell on him.
TD: That is interesting for the simple reason, today that is all done, but it's done in foundries, it's done by machines, see, and there's many, many occupations now that cover that one little thing that your grandfather was doing. Which also shows that he was a highly skilled workman.
EMS: Yes, yes, and only if my grandfather could have lived to see the changes from his first beginning of being a blacksmith, as he called it, to see what has happened today in the foundries and different things, what people have changed. But go to the root of it, he was some of the roots, that is the beginning. Thanks to God that I can remember and know that, he was
a beginning.
TD: It was very important that he have exact measurements...
EMS: Yes.
TD: What was his educational background?
EMS- I couldn't tell you, darling, I don't know whether it was a gift from
God or whether it was from a school, I don't know really what it was from.
TD: Well now, wait a minute. Could he read and write?
EMS: Oh yes.
TD: He could read and write. But you don't know where he learned to read and
EMS:
TD: EMS:
TD:
EMS:
write.
No, I don't, and I don't know what grade he made and I couldn't tell that part. But I know I'd see him with his pencil, them big pencils or markers, whatever you'd call it, he would mark, write or something, but he'd often do that. And he had a saw and things like that to cut off what he wanted, and he'd put part of it in the fire and get it like he wanted it and knock it off, I would see that, and run to the tub of water he would have, and stick it in there and get it hard, and go all over again.
The word hard is very significant, 'cause they call that hardening of...
He did ....hardening the steel or the iron or whatever, yes he did, yes he did.
Also I believe you said that he made andirons for the fireplace.
He did, he did, for to put logs on, for the fireplace. And he could lay bricks, and he had sons could lay bricks.
TD: That's another thing. Did his brother Jeff also have that same kind of training, was he a blacksmith?
EMS: He was a farmer, he was a farmer.﻿10
TD:
Was there any other blacksmith on the plantation?
EMS: No.
He made and repaired all the tools?
TD: EMS
TD:
EMS:
TD:
He did, and then he began to train other people, what I remember, Isaac Lee, and he became a good helper for my grandfather.
TD: In other words, he had apprentices.
EMS: I called him Uncle Ike, that's right, Isaac Lee.
TD: Was he the one that married into the family?
EMS: Well, Isaac Lee's son, Robert Lee, is who married my sister.
TD: Your sister Clara. I see.
EMS- And besides Lee was the man who run the gin for Mr. Polk, on the Polk
plantation. What my grandfather was the one who kept up all the works, whenever something would break down, my grandfather, that's why he would come in, Monroe Prentiss.
If he learned this skill as a carpenter, blacksmith and a brickmason before he ever came to the United States, before he was smuggled to the United States, it meant he was a very valuable slave. Also, if there were no other blacksmiths on the plantation, he was very important to the plantation.
EMS: He meant everything to Mr. Polk.
TD: Well, we haven't gotten to Mr. Polk yet, let's...of course, I realize that you knew Mr. Polk. Let's get back to the Prentiss... it was the Prentiss plantation before it was the Polk plantation?
I suppose. I don't know who Mr. Polk bought that plantation from, I don't know.
So your grandfather was never a slave to Mr. Polk?
EMS:	No.
TD:	So it has to be somebody prior to that and you assume it is Prentiss, since that was his name.
EMS:	Right.
TD:	Your grandfather was here during the Civil War.
EMS:	Yes, he sure was. But he didn't fight.
TD:	Why didn't he fight?
EMS:	Because I guess he was important to the man who owned him, and he didn't﻿11
EMS: (cont.) want to take a chance on him getting killed. When this battle
started in Shiloh Bottom, so my grandfather said, he had the ox team and went to get the supplies for Mr. Whitaker, and he could hear the shooting and things like that, and he said he looked up on Shiloh Hill, coming down there was men's blood running down like water. And the way he took to the woods and left the oxen to go home. Somehow or another, those oxen went home and they wasn't molested, they wasn't killed. And he said Marster Whitaker knew he was somewhere, but he couldn't tell where because he wasn't on the ox trip, that's what they was traveling with, and that's what they were using instead of mules and things, the yokes of oxen. Grandfather had made the yokes and everything, and trained them oxen and hauled, "gee" just like that for the oxen, and could call by name. I've heard him do it a many times, 'cause sometime he would take all the oxen, sometime he'd have four yokes, which would be eight, two in a yoke. But he would take six of them away, and just take two oxen and take us for a ride on Sunday, after we helped him in the shop and the bellows and the wagons and things that he'd have made, he'd taken us for a ride in the wagon with the oxen pulling 'em. We'd have so much fun eating that candy and listening to Grandfather's stories, going over the lake and Big Black bridge and from Warren County to Hinds County.
TD: Big Black bridge is...
EMS- Yes going across Big Black River, yes, Big Black River that empties into,
I think the Mississippi River. I've been across it a many, many times, and I know before it wasn't much more than a stream, but it's a huge place now. Least it was in '47, because I haven't been back on the place since my mother died. She died in 1947.
TD: Now, getting back to this battle of Shiloh, he was afraid that he would be involved in the battle?
EMS:
He was afraid that he'd get killed.
TD: But he was not in the military.
EMS: No, he never was...
TD: There was some attempt to draft...the Confederacy attempted to draft some
EMS:
EMS:
of the slaves.
Yes but Mr. Whitaker didn't. I think they kept him in the dining room, and'a mansion man, or help around the kitchen and dining room and in the shops and places. They didn't allow him out, and would hide him and conceal him Because he said a many times when the infantrymen would come along on horses, then they'd look up and see the Yankees coming, they d take him
and hide him.
TD: Hide your grandfather.
Hide my grandfather. Yes, he told that and laughed about it. 'Course we called him a coward, least we know not exactly a coward, he was 3ust important around the place and they kept him for safety.﻿12
TD: He was very important, and if the Army would have ever gotten a hold of him, they would have used him too.
EMS: Maybe so.
TD: Now this was, of course, all during slavery.
EMS: Well, you see, Grandfather didn't know that. But maybe his owners knowed it, and they didn't want him to get away from them. And I didn't know it either. Why, Grandfather didn't know he was that important. Grandfather just thought that what he did around the house, they needed somebody like that that was trustworthy and could do the work and do the things out on the farm and do the things what they needed to be done and that's why they...
TD: Was there any attempt to, on the part of the slave owners, to tell him how important he was?
EMS:
I don't think they told him.
TD: They wanted to keep him in ignorance?
EMS: They did, they did. Oh no, I can tell you, you know they wanted to keep him ignorant. You listen to me, I'm wearing a slave name now, and some people resent hearing me say about the slave name, but to me, I think it's important. They say, "Well, what's so important about it, it's just like a cow or mule, or any other animal with the master's brand on 'em, I don't think that's so important."
TD- Actually, I don't know why anybody should condemn anybody for their surname, it just is more or less an identification. But those people who condemn slave names have to remember that the names that they assumed from their white masters, that somewhere along the line, the white masters were serfs in Europe. And a serf was not too different from a slave and they had to assume...so that name if you go back on it, there was a period when nobody had a surname, see, and they had to take it. So I don't know why it s that important or if you could look on...that name of Prentiss would be what you make it, isn't it?
EMS: Sure, and I'm not ashamed of it.
TD: Well, that's right.
I'm not ashamed of it,-not, I'm still...my mother died with a slave name, Prentiss, and my grandfather died with a slave name. I got married, but I was Esther Prentiss Scott and I was a Prentiss before I was a Scott, 'cause I married a Scott, if you know what I'm saying, and I'm not ashamed of the name. I still carries it.
TD- Because of your relationship to the name your mother carried and the name your grandfather carried, and that identifies you as part of their family.
EMS- That's right, that's right. Because they was not Prentiss, they were born Cox. As he said, Ned Cox, it wasn't Ned Prentiss. He got that Prentiss from Sergeant S. Prentiss.
EMS:﻿13
TD: If he was born a slave, the name Cox was probably a slave name.
EMS: Of course.
TD: So that the name is what you make it.
EMS: That's right. Well, I'm not ashamed of it.
TD: Now, he did not serve in the war, and he hid when they thought that the Yankees or the Confederate soldiers would also...
EMS: Well, whoever it was that would come around on horses after the war had declared ended, you know what I mean...
TD: Oh, after the war had ended, the Civil War had ended...well, the Confederates lost. All right, therefore he was free at that time, but they didn't want the Yankees to tell him of his freedom?
EMS: No, that's right. They did not.
TD: Now at what point did the Polks come in and purchase the plantation?
EMS: Well, I guess they must have bought it from Sergeant S. Prentiss, they must have bought for little or nothing, a song and a dance, because he was hated too, down in...
TD:	Polk was.
EMS:	Mr. Polk was a despised man with those people...
TD:	Despised by whom?
EMS:	The rebels down there, they called him a damn Yankee.
TD:	Did the blacks ever call him a damn...
EMS:	Oh, the blacks loved him, 'cause he was good to them. We all loved him.
TD: Now, we do know that following the Civil War, when those plantations went
bankrupt, there were speculators who came from the North, who bought up the land and maybe Mr. Polk was one of those speculators.
EMS: Who knows? He was from the North. They called him a damn Yankee.
TD: Can you describe the house that was there on the plantation?
EMS: Yes, a great big house with about forty or sixty rooms.
TD: That's as big as the White House here in Washington.
EMS- Oh bigger, it was bigger than the White House here in Washington, with a
porch that goes all around. I think it was three stories high, or four. Bu when the war started for, what you call it, is that the Revolutionary War...
TD: No, the Civil War.﻿14
EMS: No, what is this other...the war before the...the Civil War, it never was finished, that's why the porches didn't go all the way around, they stopped. There was a tree there, a cedar, and when them cedars is little, small bushes, they call them cedars now, and I can imagine that old cedar tree, and I watched it and watched it and watched it grow from many, many years on the farm for at least...I didn't leave the place until the house was tore down and that old tree still stood there, old cedar.
TD: Oh, this old plantation house is no longer in existence.
EMS: No, they tore it down, building house for the tenants on the Polk place.
TD: Oh, is that what Polk did?
EMS: TD:
EMS: TD:
That's what Mr. Polk did. And built them decent houses.
Well now, as I understand it, Polk made it possible for the sharecroppers to purchase their own land.
After a length of time, he got tired of the farm, and he decided to sell it or what to go back to Vicksburg, because when he had this farm and Grandfather was the agent...
When Polk purchased the plantation, where was your grandfather living? EMS: I don't know.
TD: But when you knew him, he was living where?
When I knew my grandfather? He was living in Polk's big house.
Now was that house in existence at the time Polk purchased the plantation, or did Polk build that house?
No, that house was built when Mr. Polk bought that place.
EMS TD:
EMS TD:
TD:
And when Polk bought the place, he built a house and in the house were quarters for your grandfather?
EMS: Yes,
And he also made your grandfather overseer or agent.
EMS: Yes.
TD: What was his duties as an overseer, do you know?
EMS: Yes, he'd take care and have people to work his orchards and farm crops and fruit trees and his horses and the cattle they had on the farm.
TD: During slavery on this plantation, the crop was cotton, wasn't it?
EMS:
Yes.﻿15
TD: After Mr. Polk purchased it, it was no longer a cotton plantation?
EMS: Oh yes, 'cause he had a gin, oh yes, there was cotton fields. He had
people living on that, sharecroppers for the cotton fields. Then there was other people bought land...Mr. George Hawkins, I remember him very well. Now Polk place...the west side of Mr. Polk's plantation was George Hawkins's place, and on the east side of Mr. Polk's plantation was Mr. Albert Brown's place.
TD: Now was Hawkins and Brown white?
EMS: Yes, oh God, all...
TD: And were they damn Yankees?
EMS: No, they were damn rebels, we called it. Nobody's a damn Yankee but Mr. Walter Langston Polk. On the north side of Mr. Polk's place was the Newmans^s', Walter Newmans's place. He was white, and Mr. Polk was surrounded with enemies who didn't like Yankees.
TD: Well, what did they do to Mr. Polk that would classify them as enemies?
EMS: Mr. Polk would sit down, and I could hear him talk sometimes with my
grandfather, telling him he'd have to be careful, because those people didn't like him, and in the ending, they burned his gin down.
TD: Burned Mr. Polk's gin down?
EMS: Yes.
TD: Do you know what year that was done in?
EMS: I could tell you this, you get back, now you can kind of trigger this up. When Mr. Polk's gin got burned down, I imagine, please, I was about six years old. I was between six and seven years old.
TD: And you were born in eighteen...
EMS: Eighteen and ninety-three.
TD: Well, that would make it 1899 or 1900.
EMS: I think that gin got burned down eighteen and ninety-nine or eighteen and ninety-eight because, listen, 1900, I got a brother Charlie, my mother's son. I went to get the midwife for her, she said to tell the old midwife to come to see her at once. The gin was gone because I had to pass the stream of water to go get her, and again I noticed the gin, see, and the fire and all that part, and it was kind of freshly done. That creek where he had some pipes or another to run out of that for to get the water, he had built on the bank of the creek, we called it Polk's Creek. That dam that busted when I told you about my mother almost drowned, that's the dam behind Mr. Polk's gin, and it was burned down. And I imagine to give you the right estimate, about eighteen and eighty-eight or eighteen and eighty-nine .﻿16
TD: Well, wait a minute, that would be before you were born.
EMS: No, I'm talking about...I mean eighteen and ninety-eight, or eighteen and ninety-nine, I'm sorry. I remember the sparks, I remember...because my father, my mother's husband, had to sit on top of the house with tubs of water, buckets of water, where all them shingles would come in. It was so close to the gin, on the farm, to keep it wet, and to put out those shingles, to keep from setting our shack afire. I can't fofget it, I can't forget that. That's something that will stick with me forever.
TD: Well, and Mr. Polk felt that his neighbors had performed arson.
EMS: Yes, that's right.
TD: Well then, at what point did your father purchase land from Mr. Polk?
EMS: You mean...that was when he decided to sell to the people, and my father died in '32...well, I'm talking about my mama's husband, he died in '32. He died in '32, and he lived about two years, he died in '33 and he purchased it in '31. He died right behind the purchase of that land.
TD: Oh, in other words your grandfather never purchased any of the land.
EMS: My grandfather had purchased the land what he give his son Jeff.
TD: Oh, In other words, your grandfather, he purchased from Mr. Polk about how many acres?
EMS: Five hundred.
TD: Five hundred acres. That's a considerable amount.
EMS: Yes, be proud of him, they had children, sons...
TD: All right, and he willed all that 500...
EMS: Well, that was his and he lived there, he lived with his son, and his son helped him to pay for it, just like you...you know what I mean.
TD: Yes, it was a family operation.
EMS: Yes, he was living with his son Jeff, and Jeff had sixteen or eighteen children. His son Jeff.
TD: Now Jeff was the one who committed suicide.
EMS: No, he didn't. Lex...
TD: Oh, I'm sorry, Lex. In other words, Jeff was the next oldest, because the two oldest boys died in the war, we don't know what war.
EMS: No, we don't, I can't say, but they died in the war.
TD: And you remember seeing pictures of them.﻿17
EMS:	I seen the pictures of them, Quesie and Mat.
TD:	And those pictures were on the wall of your grandfather's home.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	You don't know whether those pictures were lost in a fire or not.
EMS:	I'm sure they were lost in a fire. I'm sure they were lost...
TD:	But as I understand, that they were in uniform, those pictures...
EMS:	They was in uniform, they was in uniform, they were handsome.
TD:	And they were young.
EMS:	Yes, yes. Young soldiers.
TD:	Did they die in combat...if they were in the service?
EMS:	I'm sure they did, I'm sure they did.
TD:	Is it possible they could have been in the Civil War?
EMS: It seem like it had to be in...whatever war it was, they got no pay, because they went on their own initiative.
TD: What do you mean, were they slaves that were drafted?
EMS: I don't think they were drafted, I think they just went.
TD: Volunteers.
EMS: I think they was volunteers, I think they were volunteers because the reason why I'm saying that, Uncle Jeff's wife, Mittie's father went, Jim Winston.
TD: He went at the same time...
EMS: And he got killed in it. This come from my mother. I don't remember Jim
Winston Jr.'s father, Sr., but I know Jim, Jr., because he's the one brought my mother when the water went down low enough. Why, she was stranded out there, his house was closer than we was, and he went out and managed to get in and bring her to his house, and then come on out and come to us. He brought her to us.
TD: I've heard this story of your mother at one time during the flood, who was threatened with drowning, so let's save this for a later date when we're talking about your mother.
EMS: But what I'm trying to tell you, I'm trying to tell you about his father, whose help brought my mother to me, is the one what got slayed with my two uncles. They were volunteers, see, that's what they told me. Now what could that been, was that the...
TD: Well, that was then...well, your mother told you, oh, his father, his father,﻿18
TD: (cont.) I see, because you didn't know his father...
EMS: No, I didn't...
TD: So it was a war that occurred before you were born, which could have been the Civil War.
EMS: It was a war occurred before I was born, 'cause I don't remember them.
TD: They died before you were born.
EMS: They were dead, she was telling me about the brothers and I saw the pictures of them.
TD: We had some Indian wars following the Civil War, but we didn't have the Spanish-American War, 'cause that occurred after you were born, so they were either in the Civil War or in the war with, what we call the Indian War.
EMS: I don't remember, I don't remember.
TD: Out west and all.
EMS: I don't remember none of them.
TD: Well, they could have been in the Civil War. Well, let's go back then.
Your grandfather purchased land from Polk, 500 acres, which he, together with his son Jeff, operated, and Jeff inherited those 500 acres.
EMS: Yes, and the family.
TD: You said, "and the family."
EMS: Jeff and his family.
TD: Jeff and his family. But your mother did not inherit any land from your grandfather?
EMS: No.
TD: And all the land that she would inherit would have been from her husband.
EMS: What they purchased, that's right.
TD: Now your mother was the youngest girl in the family, and she was born after the Civil War. In other words, you have listed all of the children that your Grandfather Monroe had. Did they ever have some children that didn't survive beyond infancy?
EMS: I couldn't tell you.
TD: Did he ever mention the fact that they buried some children that had died when they were very young?
EMS: I don't remember, I don't think so. He might have, but I wouldn't know.﻿19
TD: I see. The reason I asked is because he was a very valuable person, and the purpose of his marriage and all was to produce slaves. Evidently, the children were valuable so they were given excellent medical care. Did he ever mention that he had children which would have been sold from him?
EMS: I never heard him say it.
TD: In other words, either Whitaker or Prentiss never sold any of the members of his family?
EMS:	I don't think so.
TD:	He never mentioned.
EMS:	He never mentioned.
TD:	The other thing is, did they ever beat him?
EMS:	My grandfather? He said they never put a lick on him.
TD:	They never put a lick on him.
EMS:	He was a faithful servant.
TD:	That is talking about Whitaker and Prentiss,
EMS:	The whole bit. I never heard him talk how harsh...was on him, or whipped him or this or another, I never heard him say that.
TD: What about the food, did he feel that he was fed adequate...
EMS: Off the white folks' table, he said. He didn't eat with them, but after
the white folks eat, and the cook, his food was next. He ate off the white folks' table, what they ate, that's what he ate.
TD:	And presumably his wife did the same.
EMS:	I imagine so, I imagine so.
TD:	They would be called what the people nowadays call house niggers.
EMS:	They was.
TD:	In other words, they fared better than the field hands.
EMS:	Oh, indeed.
TD:	Well now, did your grandfather ever say he witnessed any beatings or acts of cruelty against the field hands, did he ever mention that?
EMS: No. He could have said that, he could have said that. But he never talked that with me. I can't answer that. I don't know.
TD: What was your grandfather's relationship to the white people outside of the immediate plantation?﻿20
EMS: Just an old beaten nigger.
TD: No, I didn't mean it in that sense. How did they regard him? Didn't the white people from adjoining plantations come for some of his work?
EMS: Oh yes, they thought he was a very excellent man. They respected him
highly because he was always humble, he had his sense and he had the know-how, he understood who he was and he understood he was a black man, and he respected the white people.
TD: In other words, his mores were such that he would call them "master."
EMS: Master, mister, and marster.
TD: What's marster?
EMS: That's master right on. He'd go marster more than he did master. Marster
Jim and Marster Whitaker, that was much more to him, it meant much more, and master. Master is something that we got in my time. In his time, it wasn't master, but marster. I imagine it could have been his language, how do I know. Marster Jim. I never heard him say Master Jim. Marster Jim. So I'm taking it for granted he was Master Jim.
TD: Now how did he call Mr. Polk?
EMS: Mister Polk.
TD: In other words, Mr. Polk never asked him to call him master.
EMS: He did not, he did not.
TD: After freedom though, he still called these white...
EMS: He never changed it. That's right.
TD: But Mr. Polk was a different relationship.
EMS: He was a different man 'cause he wasn't a rebel, he was a Yankee. And how I know he was a Yankee, 'cause I heard all the rest of the white people in Mississippi and different counties, Warren County and Cook County and whatever county, I forget, I don't know what county, I can't get all those county. I don't know. What I'm saying, was mister.
TD: Did you ever witness or hear tales of the lynching?
EMS: No, I didn't hear any tales or witness tales of the lynching. I saw charred bodies up against trees in Vicksburg on Clay Street. They were burned beyond recognition, and they said the body was a body of Jesse Dawt's brother, a colored man that attempted rape on a white girl.
TD: That was in the city...
EMS: Vicksburg, Mississippi.
TD: About how old were you then when you saw that?﻿21
EMS: I was seven or eight years old. We dare not to talk about it, we dare not to say anything, it was just there, what the gasoline...
TD: As a child, if you were seven years old, somebody must have told you.
EMS: My father, my mother's husband told me, I think it was.
TD: Told you that...he identified these charred bodies and the fact that...
EMS: Well, the people were talking...
TD: Attempted rape...a seven-year-old child does not necessarily know what attempted rape would be.
EMS: No. Because I doubt it seriously if they used the word rape back in them days.
TD: What word did they use?
EMS: I think they used the word that they insulted a white girl.
TD: I see. He insulted a white...insulting is a little different from rape.
EMS: I know, but he asked the question and insulted her, and we knew what that meant, because we didn't know the word pregnancy, what that meant. They were just saying that the girl had broke her leg, and I was so dumb, I looked to see was her leg broke. But her leg wasn't broke, but her stomach was setting out and that is the way, the language they used to us children. And my mother was very, very close-mouthed and would not tell us anything, education that we could pick up from. I didn't know, I guess she taught us like she was taught. And when old people would talk, those old people are gone, people were talking about what one child done and the other one done and had or got pregnant by, some of the relatives of that family and so on... They kept their mouth shut because it seemed to me since I got grown, pretty well all those people on that plantation are that one family. So and so's family was very, very much mixed up, one man was the keeper of all his sisters and things like that and getting children by them and things like that and keeping them out.
TD: Did you know any poor whites in the neighborhood, what they called poor whites?
EMS: Yes, I knew 'em, they called them poor trash and called them peckerwoods,
that was the name in my time. I think I got poor trash...peckerwoods would come out first, those peckerwoods.
TD: I think those names were sort of universal in certain parts...
EMS: Have you ever heard that name?
TD: Oh sure, redneck...
EMS: Rednecking peckerwoods.
TD: That's right, poor white trash. Now those were the names not only that the blacks used, the whites...﻿22
EMS: That's where I got the word, from the white people. And they said they
would rather any time, to sit down to the table with a nigger than to sit there with poor trash.
TD: Is there anything else that you would like to add about your grandfather
that you think would be of interest to your grandchildren, great-grandchildren or your children fifty years from now?
EMS: I think it's all gone and say, all said and done. That's as much as I
could think of and the question you asked me what I answered I don't know of any more value that I could add, what I haven't done, unless there's something else that you could think of, of a question that you think I could answer. But all that you have asked and all that I could think of. What I think I think I've said.
TD: I think I have explained to you, and I believe that it should be made as a matter of record, that all that you have said on this tape, you would be willing to have it released for research purposes at this time. Also what you said on the record in 1976 could be released at this time. It is our plan to give subsequent tapes, which would be of a highly confidential nature and would have restriction on its use. However, you have a granddaughter whom you would like to designate as your heir in the use of these tapes. Would you indicate who she is?
EMS: Her name is Ruette...
TD: How do you spell Ruette?
EMS: R-U-E-T-T-E. Ruette Madrice Watson. She's at Rutgers College, up in New
Brunswick, New Jersey. She is twenty-two years old, and she will be twenty-three years old April, wait a minute, is she March or April...oh God. when's her birthday?
TD: Well, her birthday would be, in other words next April she'll be twenty-three years old.
EMS: Yes.
TD: All right, then, I think that's sufficient, she'd be able to tell you what day of the month she would be. And she's in what year in school?
EMS: She's out, she's just working now with upper...seniors. She graduated this year.
TD: She graduated in 1977.
EMS: Yes, she did.
TD: But she's still working with the university.
EMS: Yes, they love her so well and she's such a smart student, and she knows the children so well, she's accepted and she's still working with them.
TD: And I believe this is the granddaughter who has traveled in Europe.﻿23
EMS: Right, she's the one. She spent her vacation in Europe, and besides she went to Europe before she spent her vacation, when she was in high school from Mays Landing, a traveling ambassador.
TD: And she was a musician also.
EMS: That's right, that's right, but she's studying electronics and all. She's a photographer and in movies and different things like that. Maybe I don't know because I'm not a college student, but she studies stuff like that and she loves it.
TD: And one more question, perhaps I should ask. How do you account for your talent in music. Was any other member of your family a musician?
EMS: Oh well, how do I account for mine? I guess, well, my grandfather, he played the violin.
TD: This same grandfather...
EMS Grandfather Monroe Prentiss.
TD: I'm still amazed at his talents.
EMS: He played violin, such tunes as "Turkey in the Straw" and ragtimes and jigs, and he'd have all his grandchildren over at Polk's big house dancing for what it's worth. He was just such a lovely person, he had all kinds of activities and things to teach us and love to see us do, and even until he was old, we would go and celebrate with him. After the old house, Polk's big house, was torn down and made houses for the people on the plantation of Mr. Polk, he bought and had a big house up there with his son Jeff, he still loved fun. He loved to play cards, he loved games, he never gambled, but for teaching us games and this and other like that, he always would amuse us in some kind of an activity that we'd be glad to go back...well, the end of the week couldn't come fast enough for us to go to see Grandfather. He was a lovely, lovable, expanse man and he was a good, good grandfather to all of his children. And for me, I thought there was nothing in the world could top him, my whole life based on him.
TD: Well, this certainly has been an enjoyable session and through you I've got to know your grandfather, and the more you talk about him, the more I admire him...
EMS: Thank you.
TD: ...and I would like to have been considered as one of his grandchildren.
EMS: Thank you so much. You are so kind, you are so very kind and to speak those kind words for someone who I love so dearly that it makes me love you more and more, 'cause them's the things which you have just said, what I want to hear, because that's true.﻿﻿INTERVIEW with ESTHER MAE SCOTT

Esther Mae Scott:
Theresa Danley: Esther Mae Scott:
This is an interview with Esther Mae Scott, affectionately known as Mother Scott today is August 11, 1976. And the time is 3:45 p.m.
Mother Scott, you recognize me as Theresa Danley, and we've made this appointment to have a conversation. I understand that you were very busy this morning and that Reverend Don Howard, of the United Methodist Church, who heads up the Bicentennial program had you on one of his programs. What happened?
Well, I was very impressed indeed with him. First let me say, he knew you and he knew your husband. Told me you were swell people, and asked me did I know you. I said yes, and that's what made me love him after you had told me the story about him. And everything you told me about him was true. He's a nice person, he's a good man to work for. He's loving, he's kind and as a matter of fact, he took uS to the Justice Department after I performed, me , and my boys. Took us to dinner. And I was very much impressed.
But this is not the first time you've performed in a bicentennial...
Oh, no, no, no. Not for this year. And before the bicentennial, before '76, I performed in many places. But for this year, as far as I can remember, I think the first, I started at the Smithsonian. I think I worked, I'm not sure, yes, yes, I worked five days over there, at the Smithsonian.
That was part of the folk festival.
Um, hum, un hum, folk group. And I'm trying to think the name of the people who hired me, informed me to go there. Was...names is kind of hard, I'm getting old. But anyway...
Theresa Danley: Esther Mae Scott:
Well, maybe...
Charles, I'm trying to think, Charles, Camp is the one, Charles Camp and another man by the name of, I don't remember his name, J.J. somebody. But anyway, names is hard for me to remember, but Peter sure was﻿25
EMS:	one of them too. That was down at the city front, at the
Southwest Washington, first at the city before I went to the mass, and then to the mall next with Charles Camp, yes, it was like that.
TD:	And you've also performed recently at Columbia, Maryland?
EMS:	Columbia, Maryland. But before that it was Westminster.
TD:	And Westminster, Maryland.
EMS:	Westminster, that's right. Then after that was Columbia, then
after that, I was in Baltimore Saturday.
TD:	But this is not unusual for you even though this is part of the
bicentennial celebration. You have been performing for groups, colleges, and all, up and down the Atlantic coast from Boston to Miami.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	And also performed over television, and radio, see. Now when
did you first meet me?
EMS:	Darling, I think it was, I know I met you at the church, at St.
Stephen and the Incarnation. And I met you at the altar. And I consoled you, you was troubled seemingly about something, but anyway, I took to you and got on my knees with you at the altar, taking communion in the house of prayer at St. Stephen's. And I received you and said, "Let's be friends and let me feel as you're my sister or my daughter." And the child of yours, Theresa, was named for you. That's where I met you. That Sunday I will never forget as long as I live. Something about you was like a golden thread from heart to heart. And I don't have to guess we are friends, I know we are friends.
TD:	Thank you, Mother Scott. And I'll tell you the year. It was
in 1964.
EMS: You're so right. TD-:	And we met at the
EMS:	You're so right.
altar during a healing service.
TD:	That's right.
EMS:	You're so right.
TD:	And I was impressed with you. And I remember the first St.
Stephen's night, that I was there at St. Stephen's. And Zain Gordy with his precious "Twelve Days of Christmas," and how we were all acting out the part.﻿26
EMS: Yes.
TD:	And here I saw you, and I knew you were a senior citizen, and
I didn't know your age. But what impressed me was how you were enjoying yourself, and how you entered in the spirit of everything, how you were clapping and dancing, see.
EMS:	Well, I'll tell you, anything for love and beauty of people.
That's the only way I can see to prove to God that we love him. We haven't seen God as our belief, and that's the God in us, the way I see it. But as the Scripture said, good or bad, "Whatsoever you do to one of my little ones, you do it unto me." And to show to God that I'm grateful and thankful to things and good things that he has done for me, I've got to be good to his people. That's my promise to God, and not to man. And I intend to keep that until he calls me in.
TD:	Well, let's go back then to your early childhood, and see how
you arrived at your philosophy as of today, and what were the factors that helped you mold your character.
EMS:	Well, what motivated me to do what I'm doing now. It wasn't a
test, this was mercy. And I was at God's mercy when the floods of the Mississippi water... The dam broke, and my mother went to let the livestock out of the pastures. And the dam broke, like she said, she was going to let them out because she wanted the calves to get to high ground. She was afraid if that creek wouldn't hold the water, the dam would break. And all the stock would be lost. And just like she said it, it was. By the time she went to do this, about seven o'clock in the morning, I think I was about seven years old. Now you have to figure that yourself, if I was born in 1893, and I was about seven years old when that happened. And the dam broke, and it sounded like dynamite, a bomb or something. And we goes out of this little shack we was living in, in the lowlands of the Mississippi just in time to see the water catch her. And she was swift enough to make it to a post in the lowlands, and there she clung to that post, and finally, in ten minutes time, maybe quicker than that, the water was up near her neck. We had no boats, we had no way to get to her. We couldn't do nothing but ask for mercy. So the children that was old enough to understand said, "Mama is drowning and going to drown." I said, "She don't have to drown." They said, "Well, what can we do? There's nothing we can do." I said, "Yes, indeed, we can do something." They said, "Like what?" I said, "Call heaven." They said, "We don't know how to pray." I said, "Follow me." And down on my knees I fell. And I called heaven and asked God not to take her, to spare her.
And
in a jiffy, when I, just like I'm saying it, a branch come
^	. - *	t. _ 1.1:_______A«
And
/YIlQ J_Il ^ J---J '
along and landed at that post, drifted right at that post. she climbed up in it. And that wasn't high enough. But her head was above the water. On and on, when the water would come higher and higher, something else would come along and drift there,﻿27
EMS:	(cont.) Since I got to be grown, and seek Jesus, and found
out who He was how wonderful and how merciful He is, I can't praise Him enough. But thanks be to His name. I began to say she was climbing Jacob's ladder, every round went higher and higher. That's my decision since I got grown, and since I understand, because when I was young, I didn't know; I knew how to pray, and I always thought there was a supreme being above me. And I always thought there was a God somewhere, 'cause somebody besides man had to make the world, sun, stars and the flag and stripes, and I know that was out of man's power, and it still is today. And thank God, I seek to know, and I was interested enough in it, and I believe enough in it, and I got enough God-like in me, I know what it is now that He is the King, He is the Creator of all things. And I can't do enough, I can't praise His name enough, and I can't be good enough and kind enough to His creatures, 'cause I read the Bible and in the Bible it says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the Word was God and everything He made, He said it was good." He loved it and He blessed it. And therefore the way I can show myself that I love God, I got to be good to God's creatures. I care nothing about colors, I care nothing about nothing but his creatures. Anything that breathes, of a person, of a human being, I love it.
TD:	This was down in Mississippi.
EMS:	Mississippi, Warren County, Mississippi, on the W.L. Polk place
when I was seven years old. Yes, Ma'am.
TD:	And you were born there.
EMS:	Born in Warren County, Mississippi.
TD:	Mississippi, on March 25, 1893.
EMS:	Right.
TD:	Your mother was also born there.
EMS:	Yes, she was.
TD:
Now, did she know where her mother was born, or did she know her mother?
EMS:	Yes, she knew her mother.
TD:	Well, now she was born in 1867.
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	That meant that she was born free, not a slave.﻿28
esm:	No, she wasn't a slave. But she was born the year of the
surrender she said, 1867. That's right, that's right. But my grandmother, her mother was a slave.
■pD:	Yes. Was she born in Warren County?
EMS:	No, I think her, no, I don't have to think. I'm sure her
mother come from Africa.
TD:	Oh, I see.
EMS:	Her mother come over on the ship just like her father did. On
the Mayflower. That's what they said.
TD:	(Laughs) Her father came on the Mayflower?
EMS:	That's what...
TD:	Okay, that's fine, fine. (Laughs) I'm not going to ask you
his name at this point.
EMS;	You can if you want to.
TD:	No, well, we'll save that for later.
EMS:	Okay.
TD:	Now, your mother had fourteen children.
EMS:	She did.
TD:	And you were number seven of the fourteen.
EMS:	That's right, that's right.
Now, I did know one, your older sister, Clara, because I met her at St. Stephen's and the Incarnation.
Well, I went to Mississippi, and I got her after her husband died. And she had no one to stay with her, and I went and got her from Mississippi, sold out what she had and brought her here to Washington, with me. And she lived here with me ten years. She come here in '60, and she died in '70.
TD:	She was affectionately known at St. Stephen's and the Incarnation
as Aunt Clara.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	And she was very dignified, beautiful woman who everybody loved
who met her.
TD:
EMS:﻿29
EMS:
EMS;
TD:
EMS:
Well, my mother raised us to be truthful. She said it was no harm to be poor and no disgrace to be poor. But it was harm and a disgrace to be a liar. She say anybody could be poor.
TD:	What was life down there in Mississippi? At the time you were
born, you speak about the flood and all. What kind of a home did you live in?
EMS:	Well, I lived in a house, what you would call now, they said
shotgun houses, or straight house. Room, and a second room if you got children, and steps to go down the back, and a kitchen out on the ground, with a shed up over it, and stove, and build seats around 'it, shack, and things like that. It was called the slums and a shack.
TD:	That was the dining area out there in the kitchen, is that what
you're saying?
EMS:	Um, hum, un hum, the dining area, yes.
TD:	How did you maintain yourself there, did you have any, did your
father or your mother have any source of employment there?
EMS:	Well, we worked on the farm. It was all farmers.
TD:	Doing what? What did you do as a young child?
EMS:	Well, when I was five years old, I was the water carrier with
my brother, nine years old, to the people who was ploughing in manpower before the farmer, John Deere, and all that stuff.
TD:	Before they...
EMS:	Before that was...
TD:	Machinery, farm machinery...
EMS:	YeS.
TD:	it was all done by hand.
Yes we did it by hand. And clean, and cleaning up land, and cultivating land for to make it workable, so people could work and farm the land, raise cotton and raise sugar cane, and corn and potatoes and so on like that.
But your first job was to carry the water to the workers, the laborers there. Now were you paid anything or were your family.
I wasn't paid nothing for doing that.
TD:	Was there any school that you could attend?﻿30
EMS:	No, not then. Later on there was a school; Julius Rosenwald,
a Jewish fellow, put some schools out there for the Blacks. And we had one teacher, and the teacher would have the children who could say the alphabets or read and write, to help him with the children who would come to him. It was more than he could handle. That was the best we could do. And for my schooling, to go to school, we had cotton to pick... And if on the man's place, if Christmas come and you wasn't through with picking the cotton, when New Year's come, you had to start. So that was one week from Christmas to New Year's. And from then, if we could go and finish the cotton, picking the cotton and getting the crops and things, I say long in February, they started turning over land with ploughs and mules again. We had to get out there, and if I didn't carry water, I had to burn brush, or knock stalks—I cut down stalks with a hoe or something like that—and work. And I had no time for school much. I imagine to go to school I was grade, say about second grade.
TD:
ESM:
But it wasn't continuous. In other words, the most important thing, you followed the seasons of the crops.
EMS:	Right, the crops was more important...
TD:	That's right.
EMS:	Than schooling for us.
TD:	Yeah.
EMS:	Yes, yes.
TD:	How old were you when you first went to school?
EMS:	Well, I, I was say about six and seven years old, when they
build the school. I guess about seven years, maybe about a couple of years later from carrying water, because I remember before it was any schools. And then later on, I imagine about two years later, they had this school I'm telling you about called Clover Valley, Baptist school. That was the name of it. 'Course they got a church there named for the same thing. And I guess I went to school about a month in this season before, and no time before Christmas, because they're always late. Never was finished gathering our crops before Christmas. They're always... you'd go to school after Christmas, I'd say two or three weeks.
TD-	I heard you speak of the cold in wintertime, and how you had to
go in the kitchen with the dirt floor in your bare foot.
And not only in the kitchen with the bare foot, I had to go get the cows with the bare foot and get them up early. And then I'd have a chance to put my feet where they got up from, in the warm place, and warm my feet, because I had no shoes. And I﻿31
EMS:	(cont.) would get frostbitten sometimes, and I know my mother
would roast turnips and she would get them out, just like some people roast sweet potatoes, and put it open and stick it to my heels as hard as she could bear, and put socks on me. Sometime grandfather would give us socks, some white person give us socks or something for the children. And fix my foot, and wrap me up, and stop me from crying, because that's a miserable feeling. Your heels split open from the cold weather. And it's just miserable, let me put it like that, it's miserable.
TD:	That was the only medical attention you ever received, it was
just home remedies?
EMS: Yes.
TD:	You didn't see a doctor during...
EMS:	My heaven, no. The first time I was—my mother had no doctors
for all of her children. There was no doctors.
TD:	I remember Aunt Clara saying that she remembers when you,
Esther, was born because she on that day, her mother told she had to be the big girl in the family and get the dinner for the rest...
EMS:	That's right, that's right.
TD:	And she put on her mother's apron, which was so big for her,
it dragged on the ground. (Laughter)
EMS:	She told me that a many times.
TD:	No, also, I heard you tell stories about the pangs of hunger.
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	In your early years, did you ever suffer from hunger?
EMS: Yes, I did, many, many time. And the thing about being hungry, anybody can get hungry. But you say you're hungry, and there is nothing you can do about it, and nowhere to go and nowhere to turn to get it, that's where the dangerous part come in.
TD:	It's more than just missing a meal.
EMS:	That is right. That is right. And a many time I went through
things like that. I remember going to the briar patches with a stick—and we had some black molasses at home—and I'm telling the snakes, "You done been in the briar patches and got yours. Now get out the way and I'll get..." (Laughs) It's funny, now, I can laugh about it. I don't have to do that now. And pick some berries, and take 'em home and make dumplings, and put some﻿32
EMS:	(cont.) molasses in it, to see my brothers and sisters eat,
and how grateful they was to do that. They had a commissary on the store, Mr. Polk did. And if he didn't have what you wanted, you didn't have any money. In the store, what you had, what he had, you just got to wait 'til that supply come in. And we never did know when we got paid, and we never did know when nothing, because he'd just take it sometime and say you didn't come out even, you're still in debt, or something like that. And those ignorant people, they had no education. They didn't know the difference. That's the way my past was.
TD:
EMS:
TD; EMS:
EMS;
TD:
That's a form of serfdom, what we'd call, where you didn't get any pay> but y°u were forever in debt to the landowner.
That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right.
TD:	Then...
EMS:
Then, that kind of food they'd give you, you'd know better than to get anything besides sourbelly for meat, or picklepoke. So I learned later that picklepoke was pickled horse meat. And if that was horse meat, we ate many a piece of it, and were glad to get it. To cook vegetables. Then they give us a little patch to make a garden. And we done our best with the garden, because that was the only source we had to get something different to eat, until my brothers grew up a little bigger. Then, we'd take sacks and chains, and put on that and go in the creek, low water, and sand, and catch fish. And finally, they got up big enough, some of the white people give 'em a gun, and they start hunting. And they get things. And we commence to surviving better and better and better.
TD:	As the children grow older.
EMS:	As the children grow older, yes.
TD:	And I assume your brothers didn't have any more schooling than
you had...
EMS:	No, that's right.
Because they had to help for the family. That's right. Not as much as I had.
TD:	Not as much as you did?
No, not as much as I did. No. Some of them didn't go to school at all.
Now what about recreation. When did you first learn about music and the playing of a guitar?﻿33
EMS:
Well, the guitar, friendly as I told you, this Suder boy was
unrVimr for mv unrip. _ .
working for my uncle,
TD:	Now, wait a minute, he's Kiser Suder.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	Spell his name.
EMS: k-I-S-E-R, Kiser, S-U-D-E-R, Suder. Kiser Suder. And he had a guitar, and it was all the guitar blues. We all wanted a guitar to play, so we couldn^t have but that one guitar, and I was boss over it with Kiser.
TD:	You were boss over it, with his guitar. And he taught you to
play. And yet you were the boss.
EMS: Yes, that's right. I come to be the boss 'cause he liked me. And he was just an easygoing fellow.
TD:	How old was Kiser?
EMS:	About eleven.
TD:	And you were?
EMS:	I'd say I was about eight or, eight, something old like that.
TD:	And the children were playing the music for what occasion?
EMS:	Well, you see, we'd been making music with jugs; and brooms,
you draw across your hand, make bass; and sardine cans what you make violins; and we had all kinds of crazy things going. And tin pans and rhythm, and that's what we would do. And oh, we'd have a ball doing that.
TD:	Who else in your family had this musical talent?
EMS:	Well, my grandfather, Monroe, Mam's father did. And he played
the violin. And sometime we lived in Mr. Polk's big house, on a Saturday night, that's where he lived because he was the caretaker of his crops and the overseer of what you call, over the other people, because he had a blacksmith's shop. And he would keep all the tools up, sharpen and beat out their thing so it would make it easy to sharpen up the tools for us to work with. And the plough for the men to plough with. That was the time before, like I'm telling you, before farm... Manpower was what we put out. The same tradition that my mother went through, after slavery—she was born the year of the surrender —we went through the same thing, her children did. Things wasn't any better. It was the same.﻿34
TD:
Let's move on a little faster. As I understand, you left home when you were about fourteen years old.
EMS:	I carried my age up. (Laughter)
TD:	Yes. You told them how old you were then.
EMS:	About sixteen.
TD:	And you were fourteen.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	And you were enticed to leave home because you wanted a what?
EMS:	Well, shiny costume that I wasn't able to buy! And I was just
like a proud peacock in it. I wanted to get in old Rabbitfoot and Woolcott's show.
TD:	Well, that, now let's get back now. Rabbitfoot and Woolcott's
show, those were two individuals and they were a traveling min£trel show, I understand, and...
EMS:	Right, right, right.
TD:	And medicine show also.
EMS: Right, right.
TD:	And they offered you employment and you told them you were
sixteen years of age.
EMS:	Right.
TD:	Did you get that pretty dress?
EMS:	Yes, I did. And didn't I perform in it and didn't I... Oh, but
I did. I thought I was the happiest and the biggest person in the world. And besides, I wasn't getting no dollar and a half a week. He paid a dollar a day.
TD:	That was big money.
EMS:	Big money! My mother, I broke her heart when I did it.
TD:	She, your mother didn't want you to leave.
EMS:	No, she didn't. So when I joined and did it, the first week I
got paid, I didn't touch that little money.. I brought every dime back to her, and explained to her why I left and carried my age up to join the show, so I could help her to get some things she really wanted.﻿35
TD:	And how did she accept that?
EMS:	She forgive me, and said, "Baby, I understand." And I asked
her, "Are you angry?" She said no.
TD:	Now what were your duties there at this medicine show? Tell us
something about medicine show because that is something we don't experience in this day and age.
EMS:	Well, they was just going around in, I think it was cars in that
time, yes, because the first car I remember was in 1906. I think that's when they come out down in Mississippi.
TD:	Well, if you were fourteen years old, that would be, let's see,
that would make it around, year, about 1906, yeah.
EMS:	The first car I remember, Mr. Quinn come out in it, Dr. Quinn
from Vicksburg. And I was out at the pump to get some water, me and my brother William. And I had a jug, because I used to fall down with the water all the time and they put a stopper, and that stopper was a boll, a green boll of cotton, a cotton boll in there so it wouldn't waste all, and I could handle it. 'Cause the bucket, I'd fall with it, me and the bucket all muddied up, and the bucket ruined and the water's muddy. But they give me a jug, and I looked down the road and saw this dust coming. And I thought it was the cows.
In that time, 1906, and back in 1900, Hardy used to take cattle from one place to another, to take 'em to a town where they ship 'em to some place for to make beef, a slaughter pen. They didn't put 'em in cars, and this and the other. They drive 'em through the country. And my mother always said, if you see a cloud of dust coming, make it to some place, a house or shack, and get under it, to be safe, because those animals, three and four hundred of those things, will stamp your child and kill him. 'Course there was plenty of children out there had been killed like that. And we didn't forget that. So I looked down the road that morning and saw that dust coming, I thought it was cattle. And I didn't hear no man hollering, "AAAuuugggh! AAAuuugggh!" 'Cause they used to make a noise and popping they whip. And thls thing is coming closer and closer. Now I look and saw this black thing coming. And no mules or horses, and nothing hitched to it. I took off like a jet. I thought the world was coming to an end. It scared me out of my wits. Off I made, from the pump, and well, I was in a more dangerous place than I would have been if I'd stayed down by the side of the road to see the car, because in that place was a marsh, water, copperheads, and I ain't seen nothing. Everything had to get out of the way for me, ' cause I was like a tornado. Baby, took off. And you better believe it. Scared me out of my wits, and my brother right behind me, in front of me once.﻿36
TD:	He was just as afraid as you were.
EMS:	Of course he was. Just scared to death like rabbits. We
stayed so long at the pump, my mother come to see what happened. And we hadn't drew up one drop of water. I didn't have any water in my jug. I don't even know where my jug was, because when I saw that car coming and looking poorly, I didn't—I'm saying car now because I know it was a car, then I didn't know what it was. And I just thought that maybe something was coming down for to get us, and the world was coming to an end. And take us some place. But whatever it was, it wasn't going to get me unless it got me out of that marsh because I was done took off. So my mother come looking for us, and she got round the pump, and she saw where the cockleburs and the weeds and things had been parted. She knew something big had went down there. She called, and we thought this was a thing come out of that car, that thing come down the road. And we wouldn't answer. And she said, "This is your Mama calling." And how dumb, "Are you sure you're Mama?" was the answer. "Yes, I'm Mama." And she said, "For heaven's sake, come out of that marsh." She said, "What was that went down the road?" We said, "It wasn't no cows, it wasn't no herds, we don't know what it was, something black going down the road, and people in it and honking, blowing horns," something or other like that. And she said, "Yes, I think some of the white folks told me some time ago that Mr. Quinn had bought a automobile, and I think that's what it is," she said. So, and I said, "Is he coming back to get us?" She said, "Oh no, he don't want you. He couldn't do nothing with you. Nobody wants you but me. And come on out." So we did. And we were sure it was her. "Where's the water?" "Well, go back and get the water." So we did. So she went with us to those thirsty people, to water those people. And we had been gone over an hour and a half, and they were sweating bullets. It was so hot. That's right. So, later we hitched up the mules and took the cotton that they had picked and what they had gathered. On our way home, this car come back up the road. It must have went over in Warren, in Hines County, somewhere way away, where the roads was very bad and dusty and ruts was in 'em. And he blew the horn again. So the mules didn't have any more sense than we had. (Laughter)
TD:	They started off.
EMS:	They started off, and I'm telling you, if we'd have come along
the Polk's Creek bridge up there, we all would have been drowned, because those mules was just as scared of that car as we was. And we all would have been drowned was in the wagon, because we had the wagon with the big sides all loaded with cotton what we had picked, and people, going home to Polk's big house. And the thing passed us. And I said, "That's the thing that come down the road." And Mama said, "No wonder." She wasn't used to it﻿37
EMS:	(cont.) either. She said, "Well, it would have scared me.
I can understand it frightened you all." I said, "Yes, it did." So that's the time I'm telling you about the car. So, now, in my time, that's 1906, when I was with the minstrel show, see, they was on these trucks, some kind of old big car, and that's what the tent and these performers was on, that's what we moved around on. And wagons with mules pulling 'em. But you see, Rabbit foot and them got a old truck and something or other, we could make faster time than we could with mules. And we didn't have to feed them mules. Just buy gas for the cars. So they was kind of popular then, back in, when I was about fourteen years old, and carried my age up. You understand what I mean?
TD:	Yes, I understand. Yeah, yeah.
EMS:	That's right, that's right. Because when the car first come
out, I was too young. I couldn't have told nobody that I was sixteen years old with the face I had on, because I was only seven years old. Something or other like that. That's right But now, I was saying, my performance...
TD:	About this minstrel show. What kind of performances did you give?
EMS:	We just give nothing but just songs, and dancing. Let me put it
like this, the most we did was lied. Because they said this Jack Rabbit liniment and Bentone liniment and hair pomade what they was selling—they only sold it to the black people. And it got every nickel those people would make, because they make pictures of people with pretty hair, and the black people wanted pretty hair, and get them kinks out straight. And they said if you put it on your head, it'll straighten your hair, and showed the pictures what it looked like. And every bit of it was lies, there wasn't no truth in it. Well, I was on that show. And I knew better, 'cause it was red devil lye, what you scrub with, was in that stuff, what they put in that hair pomade. And I'd come out and say, "Yes, it'll make hair grow on your head. It'll make hair grow on bald heads. It'll make hair grow on lamp posts, lamp lights, light bulbs," and things like that. And I knew I was lying. But I was telling as much truth as they was telling, but that's the way I had to make my living. And that's what I was doing for a living, I was getting a dollar a day to lie.
TD:	Well, as I understand it, you also demonstrated your own hair
as an example of what...
EMS:	I did. But that was the thing about it. By me being half-breed,
quite naturally my hair was floating and long and hanging. But that hair pomade didn't do that, I didn't put that stuff on my hair. (Laughter) I didn't put that on my hair. My hair was naturally real. But the hair, what the people what they's buying﻿38

EMS:	(cont.) for their hair, was curled up in kinks, and that's

what they wanted, hair like my hair.

TD:	Evidently, you were rather convincing. Didn't they know any

better, because they know that no hair grows on electric light
bulbs?

EMS:	Well, I know that. But the doctors told them that that hair,

that stuff would make hair grow on bald heads and this and the
other. And I was coming to add a little addition to it by just
being funny, to make the show funny, and dancing, and just say
it would make it grow on lamp posts and light bulbs...

TD:	Did you, well, did you take part in any of the dance that they

had?

EMS:	Oh yes.

TD:	And what about....

EMS:	Quite naturally, they couldn't hold me because I had a shiny

dress on. And I was old Miss, very beautiful I thought, that
proud peacock. I had something that I had a longing to get,
a shiny dress, a costume, and it happened to be pink. I guess
my weight was about a hundred and eighteen, a hundred and nine-
teen, and I wasn't bad looking.

TD:	No, I think you probably were very pretty.

EMS:	I think so too.

TD:	What was the name they called you?

EMS:	Big Baby.

TD:	Big Baby.

EMS:	Big Baby. Big Baby.

TD:	And did you also play any musical instrument then?

EMS: Um hum. They had guitar and different things. And what I had
learned on Riser's guitar, quite naturally, I played it. "Oh
Babe, Babe, please don't let me fall/If you do you won't have
no baby at all/We gonna have a good time, a hot time/In the town
tonight." (Laughter) Can't forget that.

TD:	Mother Scott, do you realize that you learned stage presence in

those days, in that minstrel show. You knew how to perform to
the audience to be convincing. I have seen you perform to
audiences up at the Washington National Cathedral...﻿39
EMS: Yes.
TD:	With thousands of people.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	I saw you in Louisville, during the Episcopal Church General
Convention.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	At their Cabaret Night. When you got up on that stage with that
orchestra, you had over a thousand priests and bishops marching around that room.
EMS:	(Laughing) Baby, I turned them on, didn't I.
TD:	With, "When the Saints Go Marching In."
EMS:	"When the Saints Go Marching In," I had, I turned them on, baby,
I mean it. And I been turning them on ever since. And before, wherever I go, and I've had as many as 72,000 people at the Pocono Mountains, up in Pennsylvania, out at a folk festival. And baby, I turned them on. I was up on that stand, and I got out there, and I said, "I didn't come out here for to, just to do all the singing. I come out here for the love, I come out here for you all to hear me. And let's have a good time. And come on people, children of God, and follow Mama." And baby, I'm telling you, we really had a good time. Oh yes, wherever I stop, it's a good time.
TD:	But that goes back to your early days with this minstrel show,
and medicine show. But in addition to all of that, you stayed with them for about two years. And then you formed a friendship with Bessie Smith.
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	in Clarksville, Mississippi.
EMS:	Yes, I did.
TD:	And she was a friend of Leadbelly.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	Yes.
EMS:	So I asked the people that I went up there with, 'cause the children I take up —
TD:	That was when you became employed by this family.﻿40
EMS:	...help, that's right.
TD:	They were the Klauses, Ed Klaus.
EMS:	Ed Klaus's family, that's right, that's right. Did they own
catering. One or the other, and the cousin, Mannheimers and Laudenheimers and all those people together was, I guess they were runaways from Russia, from Germany, 'cause he was a German Jew. He was Hebrew, Mr. Klaus was. Well, anyway, that Saturday I had been working so good, that Friday rather, and I asked them, "Miss, could I go to Clarksdale to see Bessie Smith? I did always admire her." And they talked about it among themselves, and they finally said well, I'd been so good, and such a good maid, "Yes, you may go." I said, "That'll be my vacation." And they told me, "Show up Monday."
TD:	Just the weekend, that's all. Well, you were working seven
days a week then?
EMS:	All the time, sweetheart. I'm trying to tell you, we didn't
have no weeks. The world go round, and the weeks go round from can to can't, when you could see until you couldn't see. We called it from can to can't. Nobody give you no time off. And besides, I wasn't at home where I could go to my little shack. I was off with them, and they's having their vacation and fish frying and having a good time. And there was nothing for me, but stuck. But her brother's, Sam Klaus's, maid said she would keep the children and my two boys that I was nursing, was very fond of her and agreed. If they hadn't agreed, I wouldn't have got off then. But they agreed. And honey, I was scared to look back when I left, 'cause I thought they may call me. You talk about leave here running, chance is you may ride... Baby, I left there running, going, me and Leadbelly. I said, "If you don't get me out the way, they'll change their mind and call me back. Let's go." And we didn't waste no time, and on to Clarksdale. We got in his car and off we went.
And when we got to Clarksdale, we met Bessie. And I was telling Bessie how much I thought of her. She didn't believe me. Bessie was the kind of a person, she drinked all the time. And she just believed everybody was after her boyfriend, which I was proud— there wasn't a thing I wanted but her voice. I just wanted to learn her songs and to hear how she sung and hear how she performed. And on and on, I made her know that I meant it and I was on the square with her. That was all I wanted, was her songs. And I idolized the "Gulf Coast Blues." And I got it down pat enough when Linda Hopkins come here to Washington and was playing down at the Ford Theater portraying Bessie and she made a mistake and asked me up on the stage with her. And I got up there and stole the show from her. 'Cause I told...﻿41
TD:	I'm sure of that.
EMS:	I told here I knew Bessie, I told her I knew Bessie before she
was born, and I did. And I got up and sung the "Gulf Coast Blues" what is on my album now. That's right, that's right.
TD:	I want to go, move ahead. How long did you stay with this white
family?
EMS:	Twenty-seven years! The Gotthelds. Twenty-seven years.
TD:	And you moved up and down the coast, when they traveled, you
traveled with them, spending summers up in Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard.
EMS: Yes, Yes.
TD:	Going down to Florida.
EMS:	Biloxi, Florida and every place else they went, I was with them.
Yes.
TD:	And raised their two children.
EMS:	To be men. One of the children is in Yazoo City now. He got
grandchildren. And the other one lives in Jackson, Mississippi. He got grandchildren.
TD:	But now, that relationship after twenty-seven years terminated
in, what did you say it was, in 1938, I believe.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	That was during the heights of the depression.
EMS:	That's right. Right.
TD:	And who terminated that relationship?
EMS:	She did. She said she was going to move to a hotel and she
couldn't use me anymore. The children was out of school. One boy was out of school, and the other was in school, the baby child, Ned. And she couldn't use me anymore. And she said, "If you want to, you can go back to, you can go back to Cary, on my brother's plantation, if you want to."
TD:	Back to Mississippi.
EMS:	Yes. Yes. And I...
TD:	Did you...﻿42
EMS:	And I told her no I didn't want to. I'd rather go out and try-
to make it myself, on my own.
TD:	After twenty-seven years of employment...
EMS:	Yes?
TD:	Did she offer you a pension?
EMS:	No. And besides that, they didn't take out no social security.
TD:	There was no social security in those days.
EMS:	Well, I know, but when it was social security...
TD:	She, well, domestic help was not covered by social security
back then.
EMS:	Well, maybe it wasn't. But I'm just saying, nowhere I've ever
worked didn't offer me even social security.
TD:	Did she give you what we call, severance pay, at the time she
told you your services would no longer...did she pay you for a couple of months in advance for when you didn't collect?
EMS:	(Laughs) I started to ask you was you sick with the heat.
She ain't offered me nothing.
TD:	Except to go back to Mississippi.
EMS:	Go back to Mississippi, if you want to. That was her answer.
TD:	You elected not to go.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	All right. Now, we'll move up a little faster. You came to
Washington in what year?
EMS: '38.
TD:	You came right after, you came to Washington? I thought you
went to Baltimore before you came to Washington?
EMS:	I come to Washington first in '38. That's where my daughter,
Ruth, my baby child was, here in Washington. Nineteen and thirty-eight. I stayed here a week on my way to Baltimore because she sent for me to go to Baltimore...
TD:	Who's she?
EMS:	Miss Gottheld, Adele Klaus Gottheld.﻿43
TD:	Yeah.
EMS:	Merty Landau Shoemaker lost her mother, 'cause when I was in
Mississippi, if you was a maid for one of those Jews, you was a maid for all of 'em. She turned me a loose, and let me go long enough to go to the hospital, and to get this baby and the mother in Martin's Hospital on Harrison Street. And I brought Merty home with Mrs. Landau, and stayed there on South Street with her, one was in the Pioneer apartment, the other in an apartment I guess is about the distance from here cross over to the other building. And when you worked for one, you worked for all, if you was a good maid. They don't want but that one. And they'll work you to death, night and day. So I stayed with Merty's mother, and brought her from the hospital when she was ten days old, and stayed with Merty till Merty was up with Ned and Harold. They was cousins. And after she got rid of me, and went to the hotel, Mrs. Gottheld did, Merty lost her mother in Baltimore, and said, "I want you to send Esther to me here in Baltimore." And that's what Mrs. Gottheld did, sent me to her, after I wouldn't go back to Cary on the farm.
TD:	Yeah. Well, now, when that relationship was terminated, with...
EMS:	Un hum.
TD:	What year was that? That's when you came back to Washington.
EMS:	I come back to Washington.
TD:	Yeah.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	Now in that period, no time were you interested in earning a living as an entertainer or musician?
EMS:	No. I had laid all of that aside. I had laid all of that aside.
I was nursing. I was domestic working. And I was cooking.
TD:	And how old were you when you picked up the guitar again in
the church?
EMS: Well, it, the time had passed, I guess thirty-five or forty years or longer.
TD:	Well, I meant how old were you at the time. Here you were faced
with no employment and you had to, you had a feeling of independence. You wanted to make it on your own.
EMS: I did.
TD:	And you went back to...﻿44
EMS:	I did, and I went back to my guitar.
TD:	That's right.
EMS:	That was my old stand-by, and what I...
TD:	But what I'm trying to say, you had...
EMS:	What year?
TD:	Yeah, no, not the year so much as how old were you? You were in your sixties or seventies, when you decided that.
EMS:	I was in my seventies.
TD:	In your seventies.
EMS:	It was in my seventies.
TD:	And you came at a period when the church was interested in
folk music, a part of the liturgical mass.
EMS: Right.
TD:	And St. Stephen's and Father Wendt and all promoted you.
EMS:	That's right. That is right.
TD:	And f rom then on...
EMS:	I had my first guitar, my own guitar, I could call my own, at
St. Stephen and the Incarnation, and Father William A. Wendt told me, "Get out and go down to Pogoe's and get you a guitar. And you get out on your own because you got enough talent. You're wasting it. And get out and make you some money."
TD:	Now, here you are in your eighties, with a whole new career
behind you of ten years or more.
EMS:	Right, right.
TD:	You have independence. However, at the same time, another
problem has come up. Physical one. How many times have you been to the hospital in the last two years?
EMS:	I been to the hospital twice in the last two years, and both
times it was for the same thing but on a different eye. He operated my eyes, Dr. Henry Wicker did. I had glaucoma in both eyes, and one eye was just about totally blind. And he said to me, "I hate to say this 'cause you don't like doctors, and I don't know the reason why." I said, "I can tell you the reason why. Because you go to a doctor and you ain't sick,﻿45
EMS:	(cont.) when you leave 'em, you're sick" (Laughter) I
never seen it fail in my life. You can go in there, and ain't nothing hurting, but when you come back, something hurting. And I said, "You doctors do something. I don't know why, but you do. And that's why, it ain't 'cause I don't like doctors. I love people. But I just don't like what you stand for." So he said, "Well, you got to go to the hospital." And I said, "Well, that ain't no news to me. I have already seen that. When, what time, and what hospital?" And I just looked like I stunned him. He said, "Are you sincere?" I said, "From my heart." I said, "Because God have already showed me that. And you is the one to do it. Just tell me when, where and what time." And I'm so glad, and I'm so glad and proud to say this, when I went to that hospital, to go in, to be check in, you Danley, took me and did it.
TD:	That's right. That's how I know so much about it. And also,
I know when I went up to visit you, you were not in that room, in that bed 'cause you were up and down those hospital corridors, in other patients' rooms, entertaining.
EMS:	Entertaining the other sick people, because I thought it was
my duty. I did not know how to act in the hospital. I acted in the hospital just like I would act, and I'm going to act the same way when I get in heaven.
TD:	(Laughter) Anyway, also in addition to your glaucoma, you've
had diabetes which means that you've been on a restricted diet. And you've had high blood pressure, and the doctor has forced you to reduce.
EMS:	And I have done that.
TD:	You've been forced to wear support hose.
EMS:	I've done that.
TD:	And you, in addition to that, you have, while you receive,
you're a member of the musicians union, and when you entertain over radio and television, you receive the union wage, but most of this work that you've done for the church, has all been a gift.
EMS: A gift. That's right, that's right.
TD:	What you performed today, you received no pay for.
EMS:	That's right.
TD:	You are receiving social security, and you are eligible to buy
food stamps.
EMS:	Yes.﻿46
TD:	You live in this one-bedroom apartment, which seems to be
fairly comfortable. However, it's a neighborhood where it's dangerous for you to go out in the street.
EMS:	Yes.
TD:	You have been mugged.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	When you take your social security check to the bank to have
it exchanged for cash, which you have to take to the place to get your food stamps, because it has to be paid for in cash, you have to depend upon friends and church members to take you.
EMS:	To take me, that's right.
TD:	You cannot go and use public transportation because of your
difficulty in moving.
EMS:	In walking, that's right.
TD:	You can't take your guitar out in the street. You've had two
guitars stolen from you.
EMS:	That's right, that's right.
TD:	And uh...
EMS:	They would take my guitar away from me, I was in the street.
And Roy and I couldn't catch 'em. There was not a thing I could do about it, nothing.
TD:	Your social security check does not cover your, but a small...
there's no—after you pay your rent and your utilities, there's just a small amount left over.
EMS:	Thirty-one dollars left for me to live on.
TD:	So it's necessary for you to go and eat at the church with the
government program for senior citizens.
EMS:	That's right, that's right.
TD:	Medicare pays for your medical treatments when you have to go
for physical therapy treatments...
EMS: Right.
TD:	Twice a month. You've had all of your teeth removed. You've
had extensive dental care.
EMS: Yes.﻿47
TD:	Things, there are little things that you would like to see.
You would like to have those beautiful dresses that you left home for when you entertained.
EMS: Oh yes, those beautiful shiny dresses.
TD:	And you would like to change your costumes often.
EMS: Yes.
TD:
You have a granddaughter who's juggling to try to go to college under, with very little or no financial help.
EMS: Right. TD:
You'd like to help her. You'd like to go to see certain shows. You spoke about seeing Linda Hopkins at the Ford Theater. But that was a guest ticket, wasn't it?
EMS:	That's right
TD:
Well, you told me you would like, you would have loved to have seen Pearl Bailey. And you would have loved to have seen Bubbling Brown Sugar and Guys and Dolls, but it meant that somebody had to take you...
EMS:	Had to take me.
TD:	And all. So there's a lot of things that you would like in
your old age. There is no tomorrow. There's no future.
EMS:	Nope. One today is worth two tomorrows.
TD:	And you have not told all of your life history. You've not
told us all of your ancestry. You've hinted a little.
EMS:	That's right. That's right.
TD:	I have, and what information you've given out has been the sort
of Hollywood publicity stuff. It isn't always the truth.
EMS: Yes.
TD:	You realize that this tape is being made for people who are
historians, who want to know the truth.
EMS:	Right, right.
TD:	But also you would like from them some kind of assurance that
you would have some of the little things that would make life a little easier for you.﻿48
EMS:	Oh, I'd be so happy. I would be so happy.
TD:	And it is a traumatic experience to go back and recall days
that were very, very painful, very painful.
EMS:	Yes, yes, yes.
TD:	And it is upsetting, especially in your age, when your philosophy
is entirely different. You want to love people. You don't want to recall the hateful things that were done to you.
EMS:	Mmmh, mmmh, un hum. I don't want to think about that.
TD:	And at age eighty, you composed a song that is a favorite for
me...
EMS: Yes.
TD:	And a favorite for all senior citizens...
EMS: Yes.
TD:	I've heard you perform that song.
EMS:	Would you like me to play that for you?
TD:	I'd love it. And I think it would be nice on tape.
EMS:	Oh thank you so much.
TD:	And this was done when you were age eighty.
EMS:	That song was recorded and I made it when I was seventy-nine.
They wanted to know how did I feel, I was entering in my eightieth year. That song now, well, it's already four years old. And I'd love to play it for you.
TD:	Okay.
EMS:	All right.
TD:	Let's start.
EMS:	(Sings, accompanying self on guitar)
If you strike a thorny rose, Keep a goin',
If it hails or if it snows, Keep on goin',
T' ain't no use to sit and whine, When the #ish ain't on-your line. Bait your hook and keep on trying Keep a goin'.﻿49
