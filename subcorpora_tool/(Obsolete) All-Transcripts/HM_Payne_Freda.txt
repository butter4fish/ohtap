Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe.  I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Observing is [HistoryMaker] Paul Brock.  Ma'am, could you please state your name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Freda Payne, and that's spelled F-R-E-D-A, Payne, P-A-Y-N-E.  I do have a middle name, and that is Charcelia, C-H-A-R-C-E-L-I-A.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind that middle name?
Speaker 2: Well, (laughter) I think I got that name--of course my mother named me, and was the one responsible for even choosing Freda.  And her name is Charsilee, C-H-A-R-S-I-L-E-E [Charsilee Hickman Farley].  And so, I think it's sort of like a throw-off of Charsilee--Charcelia, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind Charsilee?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, that, I don't know.  Because that means that my grandmother or--well, my mother, when she was born her father had already passed away from tuberculosis, from TB.  Because back in those days, there wasn't a cure for TB.  And so, I don't know.  I guess my grandmother [Ada Lee Brack] got the name from somewhere, but to this day I have not run into another person with her name, and I've traveled all over the world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth--well, I guess I can't tell a lie now, I've got to tell the truth.  My date of birth is September 19, 1942.  I was born in Detroit, Michigan at Parkside Hospital, which is no longer in existence.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Singer/actress.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is April 28, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?  You don't have to give your exact address, but--
Speaker 2: We're in the Hollywood Hills, West L.A., in Los Angeles, California.
Story_ID: 261295
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five People magazine-ish type questions that I'm compelled to ask, and they only require a short answer.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  I have a lot of favorite foods.  (Laughter) I have to laugh, because people who know me know that I love food and I love to eat, and I like good food.  That's a hard question, that's very hard.  What can I say?  I can't, I can't answer it, because I like so many different cuisines.  You know, I like soul food, which I was, you know, raised on soul food.  And then I like Japanese food, I like Thai food, French cuisine, Chinese.  But I've eaten Chinese so long, I mean I started Chinese food almost as far back as eating soul food.  I like all kinds of food.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I forgot about Italian, I like Italian food as well.  One of my favorite colors is red, and blue.  I like deep colors, like maroon, like this color I've got on now, which is sort of like a deep red, it's more like a maroon--and yellows.  I like browns and tans, and because I'm a Virgo I like fall colors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Spring.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Vacation destination.  I would have to say it would be the Caribbean, or let's say some of the Hawaiian Islands.  I like the tropical, I like tropical weather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: A favorite phrase or saying?  "What goes around comes around."  That's an easy one.  That just came off the top of my head, "What goes around comes around."  And, "When you've got your hand in the lion's mouth, pull it out slowly."
Story_ID: 261296
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Frederick Payne] side.  We'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother's name is pronounced Charsilee Farley.  Now, do you want her--now, my mother was divorced and had remarried.  Now, do you want her maiden name, her first marriage name, or her second marriage name?
Speaker 1: Her maiden name, I guess.
Speaker 2: Her maiden name?  Okay, you don't her name at the time of her death?
Speaker 1: Well, maybe so.  Yeah, I--
Speaker 2: Because that's like a--we have to be specific.  And--
Speaker 1: This is history, so, yeah, this--well, you can--
Speaker 2: I can give you all her names.
Speaker 1: All right, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My mother's maiden name was Charsilee Hickman.  Charsilee is spelled C-H-A-R-S-I-L-E-E, and Hickman is H-I-C-K-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when she married, her name became Payne, Charsilee Payne.  Then she divorced and she remarried when I was at the age of six.  And then her name was Farley, so it was Charsilee Farley.  Farley is spelled F-A-R-L-E-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My mother was born in Birmingham, Alabama.  The year was June 17, 1920.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors on that side?
Speaker 2: On the Hickmans, I can only trace it as far back as, let's say my great-grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were they all from around Birmingham?
Speaker 2: Yes, as far as I know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories about any of your ancestors that have been passed down?
Speaker 2: Stories such as, like, in what way?
Speaker 1: Well, stories about things they did, or accomplishments they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  On the Hickman side you mean?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: On the Hickman side, I remember my mother telling me that it would have been, it would have been my grandmother [Ada Lee Brack]--my mother's mother, her father had a band in the South.  And I guess they played around that area.  But anyway, it was significant enough that when he passed away, it was, there was a write-up in the white paper.  And that was I guess to say that he must have, he must have been pretty good or he must have had somewhat of a reputation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this would have been like in the early part of the century?
Speaker 2: Probably, yeah, like the early part of the century.  Because my grandmother was born in 1900; she was born in 1900.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it was her father, or her--
Speaker 2: She was--okay, my grandmother--my mother was a Hickman, so she married a Hickman.  Her maiden name was Marshall [ph.].  So, it would have been her father.
Speaker 1: Okay, a Marshall, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right, her father.  So, her father--I guess we're talking about the late 1800s.
Speaker 1: Eighteen eighties [1880s] at least.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're talking about the 1800s now.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any other stories about their activities?
Speaker 2: Not anymore that I can think of, as far as the Hickmans are concerned.
Story_ID: 261297
Speaker 1: Now, did, did your mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] grow up in Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: She was born in Birmingham, but then she came to Detroit [Michigan].  You know, her mother brought her to Detroit when she was three.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, she grew up in Detroit.
Speaker 2: So, she grew up in Detroit.  And another thing my mother told me, there was a fire.  And a lot of, that's why a lot of memorabilia and pictures and personal data that she probably would have known, was destroyed.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did she talk about growing up in Detroit, and what it was like when she grew up, what the neighborhood was like, and where she went to school?
Speaker 2: She went to Commerce High School [High School of Commerce, Detroit, Michigan], which is across the street, directly across from Cass [Technical High School, Detroit, Michigan], Commerce school of business.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when she graduated, did she go into business or something like that?
Speaker 2: She became, she worked for the city.  When she graduated, she got a job for the city, and she worked for the city as a clerk in the, dealing with housing in the project area.  You know, I guess concerning the projects.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the department of housing [Detroit Housing Commission] for the city (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The department of housing for the city, yeah.
Story_ID: 261298
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name, his full name, Frederick, F-R-E-D-E-R-I-C-K, Frederick.  Now, don't ask me how to spell Ezekiel.  (Laughter) Ezekiel, how do you spell Ezekiel (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Usually E-Z-E-K-I-E-L.
Speaker 2: It's in the Bible.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in the Bible, right.
Speaker 2: Payne [Frederick Payne].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I never, I never, I just--you know, how you're around your old aunt or uncle and they'll say, "Well, you know, your father's name, middle name is Ezekiel."  Because we never used it, we never referred to it, but I do know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ezekiel.
Story_ID: 261299
Speaker 1: So I take it you're named after your father [Frederick Payne]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  My mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] told me that she picked my name out of a book, out of a book of names, because she wanted me to have a name that was not a common name.  But after I went to, started going to Europe I realized that Freda was like an old, like an old name (laughter) indigenous to Russia, Germany, the northern European countries like Sweden.  They said, "Oh, Freda is an old name.  That's an old-fashioned, that's an old maid, like an old-fashioned name.  Why do you have that name?"  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: It's usually spelled with an 'I.'
Speaker 2: But it's, mine's not.
Speaker 1: So yours is spelled--that's why I thought you might have been named for your father, because he was Frederick.
Speaker 2: Yeah, mine is F-R-E-D, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm telling you what my mother told me, now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 261300
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a date of birth and place of birth for him [Payne's father, Frederick Payne]?
Speaker 2: For--I was looking for his birth certificate.  Oh, he was born in Asheville, North Carolina.  I could, you know what, if we take a break, I could--
Speaker 1: We don't have to do that.  I mean--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --at least let's--
Speaker 2: I can find--
Speaker 1: Was he older than your mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley]?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was older.  He was like about four years older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well--
Speaker 2: I ran across his death certificate recently, I mean, looking through some stuff.  And I can like call you guys, I can call you back later.
Speaker 1: You can write it down on the little survey we give you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 1: But it's okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: You don't have to leave to do that.  So, somewhere around 1917?
Speaker 2: Well, she died--my mother was born in 1920, so he was probably born around 1916 or something like that, 1916 or 1917.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was born in Asheville, North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Asheville, North Carolina (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And--
Story_ID: 261301
Speaker 1: You were telling us off-camera there's a lot of lore in Asheville [North Carolina] around the Vanderbilts.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  It was--my grandmother--let's see.  My grandmother, it would have been on my grandmother's side.  Her father--the Logans worked for George [Washington] Vanderbilt [II].  He was a butler, but he owned the land where the Biltmore Estates [Asheville, North Carolina] is now built on.  He owned that land, and it was a swap, they swapped land.  He swapped--Mr. Vanderbilt had wanted to build his mansion, his castle, on his land.  And so, they just swapped.  But it wasn't, nothing was documented; it wasn't done legally or anything like that.  It was just like, okay, I'll let you build over here, and then I'll move over here.  That's what happened.  But he was actually, he worked for George Vanderbilt.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now this Biltmore Estate is one of America's castles, it's huge--
Speaker 2: It's one of the most outstanding--and I've been there.  It's one of the most outstanding castles.
Speaker 1: Open to the public--
Speaker 2: Open to--they have tours, they have tours.  Like when you go to Europe and you go to the palaces and you go on a tour, yeah.
Speaker 1: Are there any stories passed down to the family about what it was like working for someone that rich?
Speaker 2: Actually, my aunt has told me stuff.  She said that they used to--I said, "Well don't you have any artifacts?  And don't you have any souvenirs or art, or like chinaware or anything, or silverware?"  And she said that one of the aunts, she's dead now, I guess maybe she was a little loony.  She had had a lot of stuff, and she threw it down the well.  She had a lot of stuff.
Speaker 1: From the Vanderbilts?
Speaker 2: From the Vanderbilts, yeah.
Speaker 1: You mean she threw it down a well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and there was a lot of stuff--they didn't talk about stuff, certain things they didn't talk about.  So, I don't know what was going on back then in those days (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, is there any speculation as to what she threw down the well, or why she threw it?
Speaker 2: She didn't think--you know how some people think, "Oh, this is not worth anything."  It's sort of like the same premise, the way people look at--the way--what we call--some people might call--oh, this is trash, I'm not going to keep this.  And then thirty years later, it's worth a fortune.  You know, like little things, like you might say, "Oh, don't keep these old records."  Or, "Don't keep these baseball cards."  Or, "Don't keep those funny books.  That's trash, they're old, throw them out."  Okay, people who kept those funny books, if they're in good condition, they're worth like three, four, or five hundred dollars, or a thousand, two thousand dollars apiece.  What was that?  A ten cent, fifteen cent funny book.
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the first edition of Spider-Man is now worth--or Superman--is worth thousands of dollars.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  And this is just funny books.  But these were actually little statuettes, little artifacts, little things, you know, that they had.  And I've heard, I've heard ma talk about it; I've heard her talk about it, speak on it.
Speaker 1: Anything else about the Vanderbilts?  Now, I know--when did your grandfather--was it your grandfather, or your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: It would have been, not my grandfather.  My grandfather died, he died kind of young, on the young side.  He actually, he died before I was born.  So, and it wasn't my grandfather.  It was the mother, it was the grandmother.  Because she was a Logan, and so it was the grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Oh, I thought you said there was a man that had land.  Was it your grandmother that--
Speaker 2: It was my grandmother's father.
Speaker 1: Father, okay.
Speaker 2: It was my grandmother's father, my grandmother's father.
Speaker 1: So, your great-grandfather.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Maybe I can call her right now and get this straightened out.
Speaker 1: You can write it down later or something.  But I'm just trying to get some of the stories.  What did he do for Vanderbilt?
Speaker 2: He was a butler.
Speaker 1: Butler, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a butler.  As a matter of fact--
Speaker 1: So, he was in the house walking around.
Speaker 2: He was in the house.  As a matter of fact there's a picture of him, there is a picture of him that we saw when were in North Carolina.  And they were like, it was like a train, because they had some tracks.  He built a whole train track all the way back, all the way up, I mean from New York all the way down there.  And that's documented as well.  He built the whole train track.  And there's a picture of him and I guess some other people, you know, posing in the picture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Are there any other stories about them that you remember?
Speaker 2: No.  I'd have to talk to my aunt.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 261302
Speaker 1: Now, did your father [Frederick Payne] grow up in Asheville [North Carolina], or did he grow up in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: He grew up in Asheville, and then he came to Detroit as an adult.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Young, young adult.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about growing up, and what it was like to grow up in Asheville?
Speaker 2: Well, he didn't talk that much about growing up in Asheville, but I've heard stories about growing up in Asheville from other relatives who, you know, who grew up with him in Asheville.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And it was just, Asheville was a small, it was a small, country town.  And everybody knew everybody.  And it was almost like--to me, I went--the first time I went to Asheville, I was thirteen.  And it seemed like almost every time I saw somebody that--like if I saw a cute boy, it was like "Oh, that's your cousin."  (Laughter) Like, "Oh, that's your cousin."  It was like everybody was my cousin in that town.  And then I discovered, well, I didn't discover it.  I was told that the Payne family, they actually were connected, they married cousins.  So the other link in the family--they have different links.  And that would be Owenses, the Logans, and the Whites.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did he get a chance to, well, he went to school down there too, right?
Speaker 2: He went to school there.
Speaker 1: In Asheville?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And when he came to Detroit was he, do you know why he came to Detroit?
Speaker 2: Work.  I guess to get away.  I guess he wanted to have a better life.  Because he got a job with Ford Motor Company [Detroit, Michigan], and that's where he worked until he retired.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when did he come up, do you know, to Detroit?
Speaker 2: That, I can't tell you.  All I know is--I know my Aunt Mary Julia [ph.] would be able to tell me.  I could, I'm just thinking--she would know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She would know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he fight in the war, World War II [WWII]?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't go.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 261303
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how he [Payne's father, Frederick Payne] and your mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] met?
Speaker 2: Oh, his brother, he had brothers.  And his Uncle James [ph.], he's dead, too.  And I think, oh, God, maybe my sister would know that.  She might remember that story about how they met.  I don't remember how they met.  [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne] might know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, he was working at Ford [Motor Company, Detroit, Michigan].  And can you tell us about your--
Speaker 2: They may have met at church or one of those church functions, like socials, a church social.
Speaker 1: Did they go to the same church?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My mother went to Bethel A.M.E. [Church, Detroit, Michigan].  And then he lived, he lived right next door.  There was an apartment building right next door.
Speaker 1: That's on the east side of Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: That's on the east side, it was on the corner.  It's gone.  That building is torn down, and they built a new church.  But it was on the corner of St. Antoine [Street] and Frederick [Street].
Story_ID: 261304
Speaker 1: Can you tell something about your parents' [Charsilee Hickman Farley and Frederick Payne] personalities?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother was like very, she was very proper, you know, very proper.  She wasn't one of these loud people.  You know, some women are loud, kind of loud.  And she was kind of like quiet and soft-spoken, but she was very firm, and she was very modest.  Her personality, she always believed in doing like doing the right thing.  She wasn't that much into--like nowadays, there's a whole different lifestyle that we have now, that we're more--because we're inundated with "You got to exercise, you've got to eat better, you've got to do this."  We didn't know--back then she didn't know that much about really, I'd say, proper nutrition in terms of how to cook your food properly.  Because she would always cook her vegetables and stuff like that, you know.  I mean this is stuff that I learned later on in growing up.  And she didn't, she wasn't the kind of person that would say, "Well, let's go out and walk and exercise."  She didn't do that.  My mother was old-fashioned, let's say old school.  And, but she was, but she was a sociable person.  She liked to, you know, she had her girlfriends and she liked to, you know, she had her social life going.  She used to, she belonged to a bridge club, she played bridge.  To this day, I don't like card games.  I don't know why, I guess because my mother always played bridge.  And every Friday she'd go to her bridge club meetings, and she would win a lot.  She would win and bring home prizes.  And they would be like, it would be anything from like glass sets, or serving dishes, and stuff like that.  What else?  She was very smart.  She had a keen mind for business.  And if she were alive today, she probably would be very successful in real estate.  She did have a real estate license, but in Detroit [Michigan], real estate?  (Laughter) But there are people today that are successful in real estate in Detroit, but the real estate market is nowhere near what it is here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  My mother was a pretty good cook.  But like I said, there're certain things that I learned once I started--you know, like in school, you know, about nutrition--like not to overcook the vegetables.  Sometimes black people have a tendency to want to cook their vegetables too long, you know, like cook the cabbage too long, and cook the greens too long.  So, my mother was a very, she was like, she was a very gentle kind of person.
Speaker 1: Now, what about your father?
Speaker 2: My mother divorced my father when I was three.  As a consequence, I didn't spend that much time around my father.  But I did spend time, because we had visiting--you know, he had visiting privileges where he would pick us up, my sister [HistoryMaker Scherrie Payne] and I, he would pick us up.  And like we would sleep over at his place for a couple of, like the weekend or something like that.  Like, we'd go and stay Saturday night, and then go to Sunday school and church.  And then he'd bring--then he'd take us out to eat for Sunday dinner and then he'd bring us home Sunday night.  So, he was, my father, he was a gentle person.  He wasn't loud or boisterous, he was kind of a gentle person.  He wasn't mean, he didn't have a mean bone in his body.  I never saw him get, I mean never saw him like get rough or get into a fight with anybody.  I never--he was not conniving, he was very--he was kind of like, morally, he was kind of strait-laced.  He was like, I mean he was a man, you know, and he did some stuff I guess that some men do.  I guess that's why my mother divorced him.  (Laughter) And he was just kind of a regular guy; kind of a normal, regular guy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who do you think you take after the most, or what traits do you take after--
Speaker 2: Well, I think I've got a little bit of both.  I've got a little bit--I definitely know I picked up some of my mother's traits.  And then, you know, you can't deny that you pick up something from both parents, whether you like it or not.
Story_ID: 261305
Speaker 1: Do you have first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: A first?  Wow!  (Laughter) Like we're talking about, are you talking about like in the womb (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well, if you remember back that far, I don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't think I remember back that far, but let me see.  I have a vision in my head of a memory of being in a car, and my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] holding my younger sister [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne] in her arm in a blanket, like a baby blanket, like this.  I just have like a, just one, a vision of that.
Speaker 1: So, you're a few years older than Scherrie, just a couple of years?
Speaker 2: Two.
Speaker 1: Two years?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, about a year and a half to two.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 261306
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe the neighborhood you grew up in?  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay.  From the time of what age?
Speaker 1: When you were a little kid, I guess--the things that were going on.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Wow, it was fun, it was enjoyable.  I remember my--I was very fond of my [maternal] grandmother [Ada Lee Brack].  I remember playing like in the--we lived, my grandmother lived at 101 Horton [Street], and my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley], we lived in an apartment building right around the corner on John R. [Street].  So, we were right off the corner of John R. and Horton, and she lived right on Horton.  So, if we were at our backyard or if we were on our back porch, we could look right into her back porch, and vice versa.  And the sights and sounds--it was kind of a slightly mixed neighborhood.  There were a few whites.  It was predominantly black, but there were a few whites in that neighborhood.  We were right off the corner, we were a block away from Woodward [Avenue], which is the main street in Detroit [Michigan].  And we were close to, about a block away from, two blocks away from Grand Boulevard.  And I just remember playing in the streets and running in the alleys, and playing cowboys and Indians [Native Americans].  And I didn't have many toys. We used to make our bows and arrows, and the boys used to make their guns with pieces of wood; they'd take rubber bands.  I don't even, I don't even see that today.  But I remember, yeah, boys used to make their guns.  They would make them with wood and like real thick rubber bands.  And that's what I remember.  And I used to get dolls.  And every time--when Christmas came we got stuff, you know.  We got dolls, and we got little cooking sets and things like that.  Actually, everything I would ask for, I got.  Like a little toy stove or something like that, or you know, a little playhouse.  And once I think we got an electric train.  You know, I don't think we even asked for that, but we got one.  And I think [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne] still has it.  So, that's an antique now (laughter).
Story_ID: 261307
Speaker 1: I remember going to like places like the Eastern Market [Detroit, Michigan].  And that was like, the Eastern Market would typify what we call farmer's markets today.  But the Eastern Market was like bigger, you know.  It was more, it was like all the smells, you know, the funky farmhouse smells in there.  And live, they had live chickens that they would kill, and all kinds of fruits and vegetables brought in from the farms, from the countryside, and fresh eggs and meat and stuff like that.  And I remember there was a theater like right up at the corner on Woodward [Avenue] called the Regency, the Regents [sic. Regent Theater, Detroit, Michigan].  And so when we went to the show it was like, it was like right up to the corner.  And then you make a left, and the theatre was right there.  And then there was a drugstore on the corner.  And back then you'd go to see a movie--like, I think, what was the show fare?  Like about thirty-five cents or twenty-five cents, and you'd see two movies.  And my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] would let us go, but we'd have to go with somebody unless--she said [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne] and I would have to hold hands and walk together.  And she said, "Now, hold your sister's hand, don't let her go.  And don't speak to any strangers, and don't accept any candy from any strangers."  And we obeyed.  You know, of course, nothing ever happened to us.  And she used to always give us lessons, you know, like, "When you're crossing the street, stop and look both ways, and then do it again before you cross the street."  And what else do I remember of the sights and the sounds?  It wasn't that much violence.  There was violence, but it wasn't anywhere near the way it is today.  People would get in fights, a fistfight or something or--.  My [maternal] grandmother had a, owned a rooming house, and she took in roomers.  And remember that movie that was just out on HBO, 'Lackawanna Blues'?  It kind of made me think about my grandmother.  Her name was Ada Lee, Ada Lee Brack, and she took in roomers, and I'll never forget that.  And sometimes in the summertime they would, the roomers, they would sit out on the porch and drink beer and then play music, because my mother had a piano inside.  And it wasn't as--in 'Lackawanna Blues,' that house seemed bigger, and there was more going on, more stuff going on.  But there's a funny thing in that movie that really struck a chord.  There was a couple--remember the couple, the character played by Macy Gray?  And her boyfriend, they were always getting into fights, and they were cutting each other.  (Laughter) Remember she would cut him, and he would like hit her, or go after her or cut her.  I remember as a child, I'm talking about five years old, five or six years old.  I remember being out, I remember looking out, I was in the yard.  And this woman crawled out on the second floor of my grandmother's house on the roof.  She was crawling out of, I think it was a bathroom window, and I can almost see her now.  And this guy was at the window, and he was coming after her with a knife, and it was her boyfriend.  I think it was her boyfriend or her husband.  And she jumped, and I think she broke her leg or something.  And they called an ambulance, and the ambulance came and got her.  But it kind of reminded me of that kind of stuff that went on.  I remember, I remember once there was something, somebody must have had an altercation or a knifing.  It didn't result in a fatality or anything like that, but I remember somebody was soaking a shirt in the tub, and it had blood on it.  And I said, "Mama, Mama, what is that?  Is that blood in there?  Whose shirt is that?"  And she was saying it was somebody so-and-so's, and they were trying to soak the shirt to get the blood out.  So, it was just one of those things where somebody must have had an altercation or something like that, and somebody cut somebody, you know.  And that's about as far as it went.  And also I remember--and now I'm telling family business.  Once my grandfather, he was really my step-grandfather.  Now, this is my grandmother, my mother's mother.  Once, I think they got into it.  And she ran from the house to our house, and said "I got to get away from Clarence [ph.], he's got a gun."  And she actually had to, she stayed at a friend's house on the other side of town in Detroit [Michigan] for like I think about two or three weeks before she went back home.  But they would get into it; they would get into these altercations and they'd have to, somebody had to go (laughter).

Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a little girl?  What did you like to do, and what would people say you were like?
Speaker 2: I was very quiet, I was very shy.  I was very reclusive.  I was a tomboy.  I basically, I was not, I was not a showy person.  I was not the kind of person that would outwardly, you know, just get things going, or want to entertain or sing, or get up and show off.  I wasn't a showoff at all.  I was basically, I was more just into myself, just quiet.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have any, exhibit any musical talent at all when you were little?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess, I must have exhibited a little musical talent because my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley], one day she just said, "We're going to, you're going to take piano lessons."  I was five.  And she said, "We're going to the Detroit Conservatory of Musical Arts [sic. Detroit Institute of Musical Arts, Detroit, Michigan], and you're going to take piano lessons."  And I had nothing to do with it.  It was like I never asked for it, it was just something that she wanted me to do.  And I know my [maternal] grandmother [Ada Lee Brack] wanted me to study piano.  And then I had an uncle, Uncle Johnny [ph.].  That picture I showed you, his name was Johnny Hickman.  He died when I was nine, and he also worked at Ford [Motor Company, Detroit, Michigan].  And he used to, at night he used to go to the clubs and tap dance, and bring home extra money.  But it was because of Uncle Johnny--Uncle Johnny used to buy a lot of recordings.  And he used to buy classical music; he had classical records.  He would buy [Sergei] Rachmaninoff, [Frederic] Chopin, [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart, [Pyotr Ilyich] Tchaikovsky, and he would play that music on the record player.  And I would put my ear up to the speaker and listen to it, and I was like really fascinated.  And he also had Duke Ellington, like the 'Black and Tan Fantasy,' 'Creole Love Call,' I remember distinctly.  He had some Count Basie, he had Lionel Hampton, and I would listen to all that music.  And that's basically what kind of turned me on.  And I'm talking about--this is like I'm three and four years old, and five.  But my mother took me for piano lessons when I was five, and I studied the piano at the Detroit Conservatory of Musical Arts for about a year.  Then she continued my musical education, this time adding [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne], because Scherrie was, you know, younger than me.  And then we were taking music privately with a music teacher.  Her name was Ruth Ann Johnson [ph.], and she would come to the house, and we had piano lessons.  She'd come once a week to the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, you say you developed an early interest in jazz?
Speaker 2: It came from my uncle, from Uncle Johnny.  And Uncle Johnny, in a way he was a strict, very strict person.  He was, he died at a terribly young age; he was thirty-one, from TB, from tuberculosis.  And also I'd like to make note that he died of tuberculosis, and his father, who was my mother's father, died of tuberculosis, and he died at a young age.  He died before my mother was born, so he died before he could see his own daughter, he died of TB.

Speaker 1: Well, tell me about school now.  What grade school did you go to?
Speaker 2: My first grade school was Palmer [Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].  Because I remember when I lived on John R. [Street] and Horton [Street], I used to walk there.  At five, going to kindergarten, I used to walk to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And--
Speaker 2: And then the next elementary school I went to--we moved from John R. when I was like eight.  We moved to Atkinson [Street], 1699 Atkinson in Detroit [Michigan], which was on the west side.  And my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] bought a two-story flat that had an attic, which was really almost--it was really three stories, because the attic was really a department too.  And we always, she always owned where she lived, even where she lived on John R., which was an apartment building, like a four-unit; she owned that too.  And her mother always taught her to own, you know.  The women always had the money.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were your parents still together at this time?
Speaker 2: My mother divorced Frederick [Payne] when I was three.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: And then she remarried when I was six.  So, by the time she remarried, that's when we moved.  Like about a year later we moved, very shortly after, that to Atkinson.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what grade school did you go to then?
Speaker 2: When I moved to Atkinson, I went to [Caroline] Crossman [Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], which is still there, Crossman Elementary.  It's on Hamilton and Clairmount [Avenue].
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Crossman, C-R-O-S-S-M-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think.
Speaker 1: Now, did you have a favorite subject in grade school?
Speaker 2: A favorite subject?  I don't remember a favorite subject in grade school.  To me, school was just school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did do you?
Speaker 2: Okay, I did all right.  I was average, I was average.
Speaker 1: Well, that's pretty good (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, I wasn't a Rhodes Scholar, that's for sure (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you didn't have a favorite subject.  But did you have a subject that you did better at?
Speaker 2: I'll say like social studies, biology.  Well, I didn't get that until middle school.  In elementary school it was just basic, like English, math, art, we had art class, and gym.
Speaker 1: Were you an athletic girl growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh yeah, I was, yeah.  I was--when we had our outdoor--we had our gym classes outdoors.  That's when you would go outdoors like when the weather was nice.  And we had like a baseball team, and I always excelled in that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I would take the last bat.  With girls, you know, like if a girl strikes out twice and she has one more hit, she could designate someone to take the last bat for her, to get the ball, you know, so she wouldn't strike out.  And I would be the one that would take the last bat.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sort of like a free throw, like, you know, a designated free throw.  And I'd usually nail it.
Story_ID: 261310
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite entertainers in those days?
Speaker 2: Wow, back when I was little?
Speaker 1: From television or radio?
Speaker 2: Remember, when I was little, TV was just starting.  (Laughter) It was just--I remember at my [maternal] grandmother's [Ada Lee Brack] house, she got, she was the first person on the block to get a TV.  And it was like about this big, the screen was about this big.  And people, we'd all sit like down on the floor and look at it.  But then by the time I moved to--we had a TV, I guess we did have a TV.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Your favorite entertainer?
Speaker 1: Entertainer, yeah, favorite entertainer.  What age?  Be specific.
Speaker 2: When you were a little girl, I guess, the beginning of your own career, before you really--you started young.
Speaker 1: I started young.
Speaker 2: But before you got started, was there a favorite singer?  Or did you even notice, you know?
Speaker 1: Well, I remember I used to ask my grandfather, "Who is the biggest colored singer?"  That's when, you know, I said, "Daddy, Granddaddy, who's the biggest colored star in the world, you know, female?"  He said "Lena Horne."  (Laughter) And then I just said it again.  And he said, "Lena Horne."  And he'd say, he'd just tell me, he said, "She's the prettiest woman."  And he described her, and he said, "She sings good, and she's a big star."  So, I never saw, got to see Lena Horne until I was like about twenty-three.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she wasn't on television a long time.
Speaker 1: She wasn't on TV a lot.  I never got, I think I probably--
Speaker 2: Had you seen 'Cabin in the Sky' or anything like--
Speaker 1: Well, I may have seen that on like on television or going to the movies, or late night or whatever, or maybe I saw something on TV.  But I never saw her perform or--I never saw her perform until I was about twenty-three.  And it was, and when I saw her, it was here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] at the Ambassador Hotel in a room called the Cocoanut Grove in the Ambassador Hotel, and I was invited by Walter Winchell.  And I sat there, and it was me, Walter Winchell and a girl named Suzie Statler from the Statler family.  But back then, it was Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald and [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.  Because I used to listen to Eartha Kitt's records a lot.  Duke Ellington, because of my uncle, you know, playing the Duke Ellington records.  Count Basie, Lionel Hampton, a little--I remember [HistoryMaker] B.B. King that far back.  Because my grandfather, my step-grandfather that is, his name was Clarence Brack.
Speaker 2: B-R-?
Speaker 1: Brack, B-R-A-C-K.  And he used to say, "I like B.B. King," and he used to say, "I like James Brown" you know.  So he was, you know, he liked his music.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, was Crossman a junior high, too, or just--
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no, no, it was elementary.
Speaker 2: Okay, elementary, okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 261311
Speaker 1: So, what junior high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: The middle school was Hutchins [Middle School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Hutchins Middle School--?
Speaker 2: Hutchins.
Speaker 1: And were there any teachers in grade school that stand out as being really concerned about your development, and really--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --that you know of who were great teachers?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember any of the teachers.  I remember the principal.  And she was this big, I don't remember her name, but she was this white woman, and she was like buxom, kind of like that type, you know, wore her hair up on top of her head.  And I was in a play, and I think I was in the sixth grade at the time.  And it was a Christmas play, and it was called 'Amahl and the Night Visitors' [Gian Carlo Menotti].  And I played the mother, which was like one of the lead roles, the lead role, and of course Amahl.  And I remember her complimenting me on how well I did, and I felt so proud, I felt so good.  It really made me feel good.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: I felt like I was somebody.
Speaker 1: Was this the first play you ever--
Speaker 2: Ever did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were how old?
Speaker 2: I must have been, let's see, sixth grade, probably twelve.
Speaker 1: Yeah, eleven or twelve I guess, yeah.
Speaker 2: Eleven, twelve.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 261312
Speaker 1: Now did you go to the movies a lot?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you have a favorite movie star?
Speaker 2: Audrey Hepburn, and also Dorothy Dandridge.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you like about Audrey Hepburn?
Speaker 2: I liked everything about her.  I liked her hair, the way she wore her hair, those bangs.  I liked her eyes, I liked those thick eyebrows, because I used to try my eyebrows like that.  And I liked, she was very demure, very lady-like.  And a matter of fact, the picture that I showed you of me with Sammy Davis, Jr. that was taken when I was thirteen, I was trying to look like her there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And Dorothy Dandridge, did you see 'Carmen Jones'?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When it first came out.
Speaker 1: Now, she's a little different from the image of--
Speaker 2: Oh, a lot different.
Speaker 1: --Audrey Hepburn.
Speaker 2: But I liked Audrey Hepburn better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean that was, there was something about Audrey Hepburn that really affected me.  It was sort of like, I always liked that ladylike kind of thing--that demure, classy.
Story_ID: 261313
Speaker 1: You started taking piano lessons.
Speaker 2: When I was five.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you take them very long?
Speaker 2: Until I was twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It kind of just, when I got to be about twelve, I kind of, I just lost interest.  I was really more starting to, that was when I had discovered I could sing, and I was like wanting to sing more than concentrate and sit down and practice.
Speaker 1: Now, how did you discover that you could sing?  Or how were you discovered as a singer?
Speaker 2: I had a piano teacher.  Her name was Ruth Ann Johnson [ph.], Mrs. Johnson.  And she, we had been taking--I'd taken--my sister [HistoryMaker Scherrie Payne] and I both had taken piano lessons from her for like about eight years.  And there was a recital every year, a yearly recital.  And so, she was trying to find some of the, some of her students who could sing, who had voices, who could sing a little bit for an ensemble to perform at the recital.  And she said, "[HistoryMaker] Freda [Payne], can you sing?"  I said, "I don't know."  She said, "Let me hear your voice."  She said, "I need singers for my ensemble, and maybe you could fit in.  But let me hear your voice."  So, she started playing, and she said, "Sing this."  And I said okay.  And she said, "Freda, you have a lovely voice."  And she said, "I thought it was just Scherrie.  But you have a lovely voice."  She says, "I want you to sing a solo in addition to singing in the ensemble."  So, she gave me this song she picked out.  And she says--and she taught me the song.  It was called 'Stars are the Windows of Heaven.'  And then the ensemble song was called 'June is Bursting Out all Over' ['June is Bustin Out All Over'].  And when I sang at the recital, all my mother's [Charsilee Hickman Farley] friends--my mother invited all her friends, and they were all excited.  They said, "Charsilee, we didn't know Freda could sing.  We thought when you told us that Freda was going to sing you were just mistaken, you were mistaking it for Scherrie."  And they started, people starting asking me to sing at their little like teas and banquets and dances, stuff like that.  And that's how it all started.  And so then I started entering talent contests, just little local things where you would win.  Like once I think I won a radio.  And then I won a trophy and a radio, and I won some money.  And then that's when I went on, and then I went to Ted Mack on TV.
Speaker 1: Now, that--
Speaker 2: That was Channel 4.
Speaker 1: Now, how old are you then?
Speaker 2: With Ted Mack, I was thirteen.
Speaker 1: Thirteen.
Speaker 2: So, we're talking about like a year later.
Speaker 1: And you're in eighth grade?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was that the Ted Mack amateur hour ['The Original Amateur Hour']?
Speaker 2: No, no, this was still Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Detroit?
Speaker 2: This was local, Channel 4, WJBK.  It was Channel 4 in Detroit.  And it came on every Saturday, and it was called Ed McKenzie's dance hour ['Ed McKenzie's Saturday Night'].  And he had, it was like '[American] Bandstand,' it was like 'American Bandstand,' but it was Detroit's bandstand.  (Laughter) And he would invite like local entertainers who were like appearing in Detroit, who were stars, you know, to come on the show.  And then a portion of the show was designated for a talent contest, and they would have four acts.  And so, I was on it.  And you had to audition for it and everything.  So, what happened, was when I auditioned for it, I danced.  I wanted to be a dancer, because my mother also let Scherrie and I start taking ballet at the age--I was eleven and Scherrie was almost ten.  And we started taking ballet, and I started--I felt like I wanted to be a dancer, because I liked dancing.  So when I auditioned, I created and choreographed my own dance number, and I danced.  And they said, "Yes, you can be in the contest."  I went home that night and I started thinking.  I said, "I don't want to dance, I want to sing."  And I told my mother, and she said, "Well, I'm going to call them and tell them, and they're probably going to want to see you again."  So she called them, and they wanted to hear me sing.  And I sang, and they said, "Yes, you can sing."  And I won.  And then about three or four months, about four months later they called me back to do it again, and I won again.
Speaker 1: Now, this is before the Ted Mack Show?
Speaker 2: This is before Ted Mack.
Speaker 1: Now, when did Ted Mack happen?
Speaker 2: That happened--I must--what's that, I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was about fourteen.
Speaker 1: I'm not trying to get ahead, but--
Speaker 2: No, that's okay.  That's why we're here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think I was fourteen, and I think I did have to audition for that.  And then we flew to New York [New York], they flew us to New York--
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're going to pause.
Speaker 2: --my mother and I.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 261314
Speaker 1: So, you're starting to sing, and people are calling for you to sing.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And they didn't realize that you could sing?
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: And you didn't realize that you could sing?
Speaker 2: Nope (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, everybody knew your sister, [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne], could sing?
Speaker 2: They did.  Because Scherrie, at that time, well, she hadn't performed in any public place or anything like that, but just in the family.  She was always the type of kid that was very demonstrative.  She would be like, "Oh, I want to sing."  You know, some kids, how you go to their house, somebody's house, and the kid will come out and they want to sing and dance.  Like, "I want to sing a song," or "I want to dance for you."  And they'll just start to say, "Oh let her, oh, look at my little girl.  Look at my, you know, look at my little boy.  Look at him, isn't he cute?  You know, he can tap dance, or he can do this, or he can sing."  And that's what Scherrie did.  She would, she was more outgoing; she wasn't shy at all.  And I was really shy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, how did you feel coming out and singing?
Speaker 2: At first it was like being coaxed.  I'm not the kind of person that steps forward readily.  I'm the kind of person that, I have it inside of me to do it.  But I need, sometimes I need a push.  But once I'm pushed, I come out flying, I come out fighting.  It's sort of like, I was just shy.  I just felt, I just had this shyness, where I felt--I kind of, when I think back on it now, I thought that people didn't like me.  Maybe it was a low self-esteem thing, a deep thing that I had inside of me, which comes from a place where if you really want to get deep--you know, which I won't go into now.  But maybe that's how I felt.  And then I was just basically laid back, I was basically shy.  Now, when it came to playing with kids, if kids wanted to bring me into the fold and say, "Oh, come on and play with us," I would--fine, I'd jump in and I'd do my thing, and I'd be fine; I'd be a great friend, a great play partner.  But if they, if there was any kind of resistance, like if I had to like sell myself to get into a group, I kind of like laid back, you know.  And I would blend with other kids like me, who were quiet and laid back.  That's what I did.
Story_ID: 261315
Speaker 1: We were talking about you're twelve or thirteen, and you were entering talent shows and winning talent shows and so forth.  The Ted Mack show ['The Original Amateur Hour'], that's like when you were fourteen, right?
Speaker 2: I was fourteen.
Speaker 1: Was that the first national--
Speaker 2: That was the first national show I ever appeared on.
Speaker 1: It was the Ted Mack amateur hour?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It was broadcast nationwide?
Speaker 2: Nationwide.  It was the biggest show, sort of, it was like--well, now they've souped it up now, with 'American Idol.'  There was 'Star Search'--and 'American Idol' is so souped it up now.  It's sort of like the competition is so keen.  But I guess it was.  Since Ted Mack was the only, was the biggest one going, it was like 'American Idol.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, back in those days, you know, they had Major Bowes.  And I've heard about this.  Because I'd never heard of Major Bowes.  And then they had Arthur Godfrey as a little kid, I mean, when you were--
Speaker 2: I used to be, okay, I was on Arthur--I knew Arthur Godfrey, and I used to be on his radio show ['Arthur Godfrey Time'] in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Were you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, yeah, he hired me to come on his radio show.  I was on his radio show several times.  Not the talent show, but the radio show.
Speaker 1: Is that before the Ted Mack show?
Speaker 2: No, that was after.
Speaker 1: After, okay.
Speaker 2: That was after.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Story_ID: 261316
Speaker 1: So, the first big breakthrough is Ted Mack ['The Original Amateur Hour'], I guess?
Speaker 2: Ted Mack, that was my first big break.
Speaker 1: So, how did that come about?  Tell us how that happened.
Speaker 2: Well, he was on the air, and it was like a talent show.  And let's say kids of all ages were, you know, entering, you know, were getting on his show.  And he even had adults.  I mean he would, there was no restrictive age.  He would have teenagers, he'd have adults, you know, all participating and competing.  And I believe we just found out, we found out they were auditioning people to be on the show.  And I guess we found out where it was, or heard about where it was going to be, and my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] took me.
Speaker 1: In Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: In Detroit.  And that's how I got on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have to go to New York [New York] to be on the show?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, that's where they broadcast it, from New York.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us what that was like.  Had you been to New York before?
Speaker 2: I think this was my first time.  It was either that or my second time.  The first time was with my father, Frederick [Payne].  And we'd gone on a trip to North Carolina, to Asheville [North Carolina].  And then from Asheville they drove to New York to visit some more relatives.  And I remember that was my first time seeing the New York skyline.  But going to New York to do Ted Mack was more exciting, because we flew, and they flew us first class.  And I remember having caviar, but it wasn't the expensive kind.  It was that, it was that white, lumpfish caviar. (Laughter) And I said, "If this is what they call caviar, it doesn't taste like fish eggs, it tastes like fish shit."  (Laughter) But then once I had good caviar--Beluga, Sevruga, or Osetra--or whatever caviar the right way--I said, "Now, I see what they're talking about.  This is the good stuff," and I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I didn't have good caviar until I was in my twenties.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you flew over to New York?
Speaker 2: New York.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I stayed at the Forest Hotel [Hotel Forrest, New York, New York].  It was on 48th Street [sic. 49th Street] or something like that, in the forties.  And I did the show and then flew back.  And I came in second place, by the way.  And the first place winner was this Italian tenor, and he was going for his third win.  So, I guess he had more cousins, (laughter) because you have to call in.  I think then you had to like, I think, write in your votes.  Wasn't it write in or call in?
Speaker 1: Wasn't it applause or something?  I think it was applause in those days, where they stand over you and hold their hand up and everybody would applaud.
Speaker 2: But also, they had, I think you had to like--I don't remember.  You know what, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think on the old shows, there used to be applause.
Speaker 2: Applaud, like hold their hand up?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they had the meter or something.  I don't know.  They--
Speaker 2: No, I think they had to call in.
Speaker 1: Call in?
Speaker 2: Call in or write in, yeah.  See 'Jeopardy.'  Remember, remember--because I remember, you know, like we were doing all our part, as much as we could do.  And I came in second.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do on the show?
Speaker 2: 'From This Moment On.'
Speaker 1: Okay, so you sang a Broadway song, 'From This Moment On.'
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. (Singing) "From this moment on, you and me dear, only tea for two, dear, from this moment on.  From this happy day, no more blue songs, only hoop-dee-doo songs from this moment on."  Or either I did, it was either 'From this Moment On,' or 'That Old Black Magic.'  Maybe it was 'That Old Black Magic.'
Speaker 1: Now, that--
Speaker 2: You know, in that write-up in Jet, if I read it, maybe it might mention what I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That would be interesting.  Now, were you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I did 'From This Moment On.'
Speaker 1: Were you the only black contestant on the show?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And if you did 'That Old Black Magic,' that would really be interesting (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But I know I have won a contest singing 'Old Black Magic.'  I think it might have been the one on Detroit, though.  Because when I won, the first time I won, I did 'Too Young to Go Steady,' I'll never forget that.  And then the second time I won, I think it was 'That Old Black Magic.'  And then when I went to Ted Mack, I did 'From This Moment On.'  I'm sure I did, I think it was 'From This Moment On.'
Speaker 1: Now, you're fourteen?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you're, yeah, that's fourteen years old.  And that's 1956, '57 [1957]?
Speaker 2: Well, it's in the magazine.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It's in the magazine.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Story_ID: 261317
Speaker 1: So, what happened after coming in second place?  Is that when you got on the Arthur Godfrey ['Arthur Godfrey Time'] show?
Speaker 2: No, the Arthur Godfrey Show, that didn't come until, I had moved to New York [New York] by then.  That was like in '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay, well, let's skip--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Let's let that go for now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But what happened next?  Tell me, what happened next?
Speaker 2: I was still in school.  I was in high school [Central High School, Detroit, Michigan], and I was still singing on the radio, Make Way for Youth, on WJR.  And oh, I'm missing something.  Then came [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy, Jr.  Now, I actually met--Berry came along when I was about thirteen, because he'd heard about me.  Now, the Gordy family, they went to the same church that my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] went to, which was Bethel A.M.E. [Church, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's an old established--
Speaker 2: Church.
Speaker 1: --church.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Berry was like just beginning, he was writing songs for Jackie Wilson.  Before that, I mean, he started out, he was at Ford [Motor Company, Detroit, Michigan].  Then he decided he wanted to write songs.  And he had some hit songs with Jackie Wilson.  And he was scuffling and hustling, you know, trying to get ahead.  And he heard about me, because he was trying to get talent together.  He had already, he already was with [HistoryMaker] Smokey [Robinson] and Claudette [Rogers Robinson] and then the Miracles.  He got, he was with a guy named Marv Johnson.  And he heard about me from the talent contest, and I guess from the different things I was doing around Detroit [Michigan].  I started to get a little reputation around Detroit, and he contacted my mother.  Now, my mother knew him and the whole family, because she used to work--his parents [Bertha Fuller Gordy and Berry Gordy, Sr.] had a grocery store right in the neighborhood, and Mama used to work for them when she was seventeen.  And so, he contacted my mother and said he wanted to do something, he wanted to work with me.  He said, "I heard about your daughter.  I'm the business, I'm writing songs, I think can do something with her."  And she was a little hesitant at first because, you know, she wasn't sure.  Because you know, at that time I was, I was fully developed, you know, and all that.  I was really fully developed, and I was like--but I was still a child, like thirteen years old.  So, he would come to my dance class.  I would take dance lessons.  I took ballet, I took modern dance, Afro-Cuban.  He would come and watch me, and then he started like getting ideas.  He saw where I could dance and move around.  And then he said, "I'm going to write some songs for you, and we're going in the studio and record them."  So, we went into United Sound [Systems, Detroit, Michigan] in Detroit.  And Robert Bateman was there, [Thomas] Beans Bowles was there.  I don't know, maybe James Jamerson might have been there.  But anyway--
Speaker 1: These are the musicians in this group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, they're all--
Speaker 1: The Funk Brothers, they call them now, right?
Speaker 2: Well, a couple of them.  Beans Bowles, Beans Bowles was a sax player.  James was like, was a bass player, and they're both deceased now.  Robert Bateman is still alive.  Anyway, Berry wrote three songs for me.  We cut them and then he had--he was doing some business with a guy named George Kelley.  George Kelley was a nightclub owner, black guy, nightclub owner--and I think numbers, which a lot of--which was no big deal.  I mean, a lot of people did that.  By the way, my [maternal] grandmother [Ada Lee Brack], I remember my grandmother had something to do with numbers.  Because I remember in her dining room, she used to have all these papers on the dining room table.  And this man named Henry [ph.] used to come by.  And Henry had this straw hat and he wore suits, he was real sharp.  And he used to come by.  And I said, "Grandma, why is, what is Mr. Henry, what is he doing here?"  She said, "Oh, just never mind, just go in there and play, go outside and play."  (Laughter) And then I knew they were doing it, because everybody played numbers; that was like a thing, you know.  Like the lottery today, only you just--I mean it was illegal, right?  But it was still something that black people did.  And that's basically how they made their extra money.  So anyway--okay, now what was the point?  How did I get to that?
Speaker 1: You were talking about Berry Gordy.
Speaker 2: Oh, Berry, yeah.
Speaker 1: You said he wrote three songs for you.
Speaker 2: He wrote three songs for me.  Now, why was I telling you about that?
Speaker 1: That's how you met Berry Gordy, and started--
Speaker 2: Oh, George Kelley, George Kelley--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's how I got, I went into that, I went over there, okay.
Speaker 1: I went around the block to tell you one thing, and I got diverted.
Story_ID: 261318
Speaker 1: George Kelley was a night--he owned a nightclub [Mr. Kelley's, Detroit, Michigan], and he was also into some other stuff.  He drove, he had a white Cadillac with white leather interior.  So, [HistoryMaker] Berry [Gordy] had, he was working with George Kelley.  George Kelley was helping to finance Berry in some of his endeavors.  So, George Kelley--Berry wanted to go to New York [New York] and take me.  Of course, my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] came along, and [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne].  And it was me, my mother, Scherrie, George Kelley, and Berry and I, we all drove to New York from Detroit [Michigan].  And once we arrived--and you know, that's like over a thousand miles, it's a long drive.  We arrived in New York, and he drove straight to the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York], and Little Willie John was appearing there.  And I guess he wanted to, he had some business with Little Willie John, because Little Willie John was headlining.  And he came to the stage door, and he had like a smoking jacket on.  And they talked for a few minutes, and then we left.  We were there for like a day or two, and then we drove back.  Berry was, while he was there, he was there trying to get a record deal for me with Roulette Records.  What's his name?  I'm trying to remember the guy who owned, who ran Roulette Records.  He was a gangster.  [Morris] Levy?  I'll think about that.
Speaker 2: Didn't he have the Shirelles or somebody?
Speaker 1: The Shirelles?  That was Scepter [Records].  That was Florence Greenberg, and that was Luther Dixon, the Shirelles.  (Singing) "Tonight you're mine completely."  'Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,' is that right?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: (Singing) "You said you're going to love me. Tonight's the night."  Anyway, it'll come to me in a minute and I'll get back to it.  But anyway, we went back to Detroit, and Berry sat down with my mother.  By that time, we were living on Glynn Court, the corner of Glynn Court and 14th [Street].  And he sat down with my mother and he said, "I want a contract, I want to manage [HistoryMaker] Freda [Payne]."  And I remember my mother and I would like go in the hallway and sit on the staircase and listen while they were in the living room talking.  And my mother would question him, like go over financially, like, "Okay, what does this entail?  What would you do if my daughter has to fly somewhere?  Who pays for plane tickets?  Who pays for the hotels?  Who pays for her gowns?"  And he always said, "Your daughter would have to pay for that.  It would come out of her salary."  "And then what do you want?  What's your compensation?"  He wanted like I think twenty-five percent.  She says, "Well, then what does the agent get?"  He said, "Ten percent."  She said, "That's thirty-five percent."  She said, "That leaves my daughter with nothing."  We didn't do anything, just strictly because my mother was like--you know.  And he wouldn't budge and she wouldn't budge.  So, that's what happened.
Speaker 2: Do you suspect--now, I mean I don't know what you found in those days.  But now, do you suspect that other artists signed those kind of contracts with Berry Gordy?
Speaker 1: Of course, they did.  How do you think they got there?  I know for a fact, because a few years later it came around again where I had a chance to sign with him again, after they had started to hit.  And I'll never forget, the attorney was Ralph Seltzer.  And I had an attorney, too, [S.] Allen Early, Jr., who was one of Detroit's top black criminal attorneys, and he also helped me a lot.  He was our neighbor and a friend.  And Allen Early--oh, this was like I said, the second time around, when Motown was more established.  They sent the contract to the house for me to sign, and we gave the contract to Allen to look at, and sent it back to Ralph Seltzer.  This was, Motown was established by then.  And Berry called and he said, "I'm insulted."  He said, "You had somebody look at my contract?"  He says, "You sign the contract as is."  He says, "We can be friends, but we can't do business."  So, that was that.  And I had, I've never had any regrets.  And even more so, there are points where I kind of like maybe thought--well, especially after the success of Diana Ross and how far she went.  Because I realize history could have been different.  Because if I had been there, it would have been a whole different scenario, I'm sure.  You know, I'm not saying that Diana Ross or anybody else would not have excelled; they would have all.  You know, because I think everything is pre-ordained anyway.  But I felt like it just wasn't meant to be.
Story_ID: 261319
Speaker 1: But, I guess what you might not be saying--but let me say it for you.  I guess at that point you were more developed as an artist than someone like Diana Ross or--
Speaker 2: In a way, I was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But he [HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] was, he was in the process--he knew what to do, and he did.  By the way, and this is--you can quote this, because he said it out of his own mouth.  And he, I mean, he doesn't deny it.  Years later, this is years later, and it was like, it was 1983 in Las Vegas [Nevada] at the Desert Inn when I was starring in 'Sophisticated Ladies' with Paula Kelly and Harold Nicholas.  And he came to see the show, and he came backstage to say hi.  And he saw the show.  And he was in Paula's dressing room, and I was there.  And he said in front of a lot of people, he said, "Well, you know, I've known [HistoryMaker] Freda [Payne] a long time."  He says, "Freda is the one who inspired me to do what I had to do.  I saw through her what I needed to do."  Because he saw--the deal was he saw that he needed to get an artist, because I could dance.  I was versatile; I could dance, I could sing, you know.  And he knew what he wanted.  So, he saw that in Diana, that she had that ability.
Speaker 1: They had to kind of develop her.
Speaker 2: Oh, he developed--oh, he developed her.  But she was smart and she was willing to learn, and she had the ability.  And she delivered, she delivered.
Story_ID: 261320
Speaker 1: All right.  So, well, what happened?  What did you do after not signing those contracts [with HistoryMaker Berry Gordy] (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I continued singing on the radio, and did some commercials, little commercials in Detroit [Michigan].  And you know, I just continued on my path.  And--
Speaker 1: So, you were in high school.  What's the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: Central High [School, Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 1: Central High, okay.
Speaker 2: Central High.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did they have a specialized arts curriculum there at all?
Speaker 2: No, they just had, they had music, they had choir, they had a music course.  I was in the modern dance club.  I was in the modern dance club, and I also took all, I took all my music courses and the dance courses.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Anything artistic, I did it.  But I was never on the cheerleading team, because I didn't have time for it, or the energy, because I was already wearing myself out doing all the other stuff I was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, and you're still in demand as a singer in various events?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Had you begun to sing with a group or anything, you know?
Speaker 2: The only group I ever sang with in my life was The Three Debs.  And that was with Don Large on his weekly radio show, 'Make Way for Youth.'  And I had solos, and then I sang with The Three Debs.
Speaker 1: So The Three Debs were a feature of 'Make Way for Youth'?
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: We didn't sing every Saturday, but you know, he would give us a spot every now and then.  And then he also let me sing solos.
Speaker 1: He was the disc jockey of that show?
Speaker 2: No, no, he was the choral leader.  It was his radio show, and he had, it was like a chorus, the Don Large Chorus.  You had to audition for it, and you had to be a really good sight reader.  And there weren't too many blacks in it.  It was just me, Ursula [Walker], and Carmen [Mathis], we were the only, the three black girls in the whole thing.  And then there was a couple of black guys.  It was primarily a white organization.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, are there any teachers or mentors around the high school time period that you remember that really helped you?
Speaker 2: Academically, I can't refer to anyone, because I wasn't that--I didn't excel that much academically.  I excelled more in entertainment.  And there was a teacher in the gym, she was also the dance teacher as well.  Her name was Ann Cade [ph.], and I remember she influenced me, she influenced me a lot.
Story_ID: 261321
Speaker 1: So, when you were on the verge of graduating from [Central] High School [Detroit, Michigan]--when did you--did you come in out in 1960, I guess?
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-nine [1959].
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959], okay.  Did you, at that time did you think that you would go right into professional entertainment, or go to college (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I did, I didn't think I did--I did.  And it was, it was fate.  It was just, it's almost like it just happened.  It was sort of like, sort of like things just, a puzzle just fell into place.  I graduated, I was sixteen.  I graduated in '59 [1959], and that fall I had an opportunity to audition for Pearl Bailey, to go on the road.  And I had just turned seventeen, because my birthday is September 19th.
Speaker 1: Now, what--
Speaker 2: And I was on the road, and I went on the road with Pearl Bailey in September.
Speaker 1: How did that take place?  Did Pearl Bailey, now she, she had a revue or something?
Speaker 2: She had a revue, the Pearl Bailey Revue.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you exactly how it happened.  I mentioned to you a guy named Attorney [S.] Allen Early, Jr.  He was our neighbor and he was a friend of ours, our neighbor.  And he became, he used to help me a lot with legal things. He would like look at a contract for me, and help out.  Anyway, he was friends with my parents [Charsilee Hickman Farley and Sam Farley].  Anyway, he was at a party, a cocktail party, and he met Pearl Bailey's road manager and coordinator.  His name is [HistoryMaker William] Bob Bailey.  Bob Bailey is now a resident of Las Vegas [Nevada].  And a matter of fact, I just saw him at the Trumpet Awards, he and his wife, Ann [Anna Bailey].  And Bob happened to mention that one of the singers was leaving the show, a background singer for Pearl's group--that the alto, one of the singers, was leaving the show.  And so then Allen said, "Well, gee, I know a little girl who's a terrific singer, and she just graduated from high school.  Maybe she might want that job."  And he said, "Well, I'm holding auditions."  I think it was the next day or something like that, or two days later.  And he called and told my mother about it, and then told me.  And they told me about it and asked me did I want to do it, did I want to go for the audition?  And I said, I said, "Why not?"  So I said, "Who else is auditioning?"  And they said it was, they were all professionals who were auditioning, you know, people who were working in nightclubs and around Detroit [Michigan] and locally.  So, they also said they wanted a dancer, they were looking for dancers, too.  But the dancers were going to be for the Moulin Rouge [Las Vegas, Nevada] in Vegas for another show that he was handling.  I auditioned for both, and I was hired for both.  I got the Pearl Bailey Revue, they wanted me for that, and I got hired.  And also he said, he says, "We want you for the Moulin Rouge, too."  The Moulin Rouge thing never happened, but the Pearl Bailey thing did.  And I think two days later, I won.  They put me on the bus, my parents took me to the bus.  And I went on the road.  The first place we went was Cincinnati [Ohio].  And then from Cincinnati we went to New York [New York], the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York], and then to Washington, D.C.
Story_ID: 261322
Speaker 1: 'Kay, so, you're on the road with Pearl Bailey.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, what was that like?  Now, did you get a chance to know Pearl Bailey?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess as much as I possibly could have.  But I mean, I'm seventeen years old, and I'm the youngest person in the whole troupe.  They designated a lady to kind of like be a chaperone for me, who was the oldest lady in the show [Pearl Bailey Revue].  And oh, my God, when I think about it now she was like fifty-five, and I thought she was old.  I'm like, I'm older than that now.  Ooh, unfathomable!  (Laughter) But whatever your concept of age might be, it's all relevant, just a number.
Speaker 1: That's all.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, anyway, but at the time it was really, at that point it was, I mean I was like overwhelmed.  I was like, wow, I'm getting ready to go--I'm going out.  This was my first job, I'm going on the road, I'm getting on the bus; this is exciting.  Oh, boy, you know, and I'm getting paid.  It was only a hundred and twenty-five dollars a week.  And my parents [Charsilee Hickman Farley and Sam Farley] had to send me money to--you know, because I spent my money, because I had to buy a lot of stuff.  Pearl had rules, she had rules you had to follow.  It was like you just don't work for Pearl Bailey.  I mean, you do your job, you deliver, but you had--there were more responsibilities than just saying, "I'm singing, I'm contracted to work in Pearl Bailey's show as a background singer, and I'm going to follow, I'm going to sing my part and do my part and wear the costume I'm supposed to wear."  You had to do more than that.  You had to, if you were going to wear any scent at all, meaning your own personal toiletries, like perfume or cologne, you had to wear what she wore.  And that was Replique by Jean Revier [sic. Replique by Raphael].  Yeah, I pronounced it right.  Replique, which I hate that scent to this day.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: Don't ask me to spell it.  (Laughter) Replique, by Jon Revien, okay.  That would, I think they still, it's still out there, but I haven't noticed it because there's so many scents now it's like ridiculous.
Speaker 1: You didn't like it enough to keep wearing it after the--
Speaker 2: Nah, I didn't want to wear it after that.  And then you also had--even more--and the reason why--and the reason why you had to wear the same cologne, I mean perfume that she wore--she said she didn't want conflicting scents backstage.  The second thing I had to do is that when it came to makeup--because I had to buy all new makeup, because at that point I didn't really have that much makeup, because I wasn't into wearing a lot of makeup anyway at that point.  So, I bought eyelashes.  She required you to wear a certain color.  You had to wear the color that she wore, Pancreal [ph.] number 28, which was way too dark for me, and it was too red, very red; it was dark and red.  And there was a white girl in the cast, and she had to wear the same thing.  And the reason?  She wanted everybody to be the same color.  (Laughter) So, that was it.  And other than that, I remember putting on lashes.  And it was oh, God, I didn't know how to do it.  I had a hard time putting on my lashes, because that was the first time I wore eyelashes.  And what else?  It was a rewarding experience.  I was just telling you the downside.  The upside was that I got a chance to perform on the same stage with a legendary icon, and I got to see her work up close.  And I stood there and watched her and how she took care of business.  She was a very strong person; she was a very masterful person.  She didn't, I mean, you didn't do anything.  You didn't walk over her.  If anything, she walked over you.  And she ran a tight ship, she ran a tight ship.  The show was wonderful.  The show was wonderful, and it was a great experience for me.  It was my first time appearing and performing on the stage of the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] as a professional.  I had been there before in the amateur contests.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how long were you on the road with Pearl Bailey?
Speaker 2: It wasn't long.  It was only like about three or four, about three months.  And then she got, what happened was she got sick.  She got sick, and we had to shut the show, you know, shut down.
Story_ID: 261323
Speaker 1: 'Kay.  So, what did you do next [after the Pearl Bailey Revue]?
Speaker 2: After that, the same person, our same friend, Attorney [S.] Allen Early [Jr.], he met Mercer Ellington at a cocktail party, same thing.  And he started telling Mercer about his, you know, his friend, his friend's daughter [HistoryMaker] Freda Payne, what a great singer she is, and that he felt that maybe I might, you know, that Mr. [Duke] Ellington should hear me.  So, Mercer wanted to hear me first.  So, I sang for Mercer.  I think Mercer came, they brought Mercer by the house.  I sang for Mercer, and Mercer said, "I think my dad should hear you.  I think, really, he should definitely hear you."  He said, "They're going to be there at the [Grand] Riviera Theater [Detroit, Michigan], and they're staying at the Gotham Hotel [Detroit, Michigan]."  That was the black hotel.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The Gotham.  And he said, "And we're leaving the day after tomorrow, so I guess we'd better hurry, you know, and see if I can get my dad to make an arrangement to hear you."  So, he did, and my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] dropped me by there.  And he was there with Mr. Ellington, and he had a suite, and he had a piano in his suite, it was an upright.  I'll never forget, it was an upright.  And he played, I think, 'I've Got it Bad and That Ain't Good,' 'Blue Indigo' [sic. 'Mood Indigo'] and a couple of songs, two or three songs for me.  And then he turned to me and he said, he said, "Yeah, you got it."  He said, "I think you got something."  He says, "You kind of--."  He started talking about Lena Horne, and he said I fit into that kind of category.  He said, "You know what?"  He says, "I want to hear you sing with my band."  He said, "I want to hear you sing with the band."  He says, "Unfortunately, we're leaving tomorrow.  We're going to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], we're going to the Holiday House [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]."  That's a, it's a hotel/motel outside of Pittsburgh, and they have like, they had a room. They had like, you know, a nightclub room.  Because years later, after a 'Band of Gold' I worked there, I headlined there myself.  And he said, "We're going there next."  And he said, "If your mother can bring you to Pittsburgh, I'll bring you up and let you sing with the band."  So, we drove to Pittsburgh--Mama, [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne], and a man by the name of Matt Ferguson, who was a pianist; he was like one of my mentors.  His name was Matt Ferguson, and he worked with me a lot, you know, teaching me and encouraging me to learn songs, and teaching me a lot of standards.  And he taught me a lot of things about the nightclub business, and people and stuff, and the wherefore and whatever in the business.  And he went, and we drove to Pittsburgh and checked in at the, what's that?  The Holiday House, and we went to the show.  And he brought me up, and I sang.  I did about two or three, two numbers.  And after that, he said he'd like me to sing with the band, and he sent a contract, he mailed it in the mail.  He said he wanted me to be his band singer.  He sent a contract to the house, a contract that would have required me to be with his band for ten years.  And Allen Early looked at the contract, and my mother, too.  Because Allen became my guardian, by the way, it was a legal thing.  Like, I think you have to have a guardian.  And Allen just said "I think we need to change some things."  My mother said, "I believe so, too."  And what they wanted to change--my mother felt that first of all, she said she didn't think it was right for me to be in a contract that would extend beyond my twenty-first birthday.  That was one stipulation.  The next thing she said--I think the salary started out at like $225, and then it went to $325, then $425.  My mother said, "Well, Mr. Ellington, what if in about four or five years from now my daughter has become a big star, as a result of being with your band?  Would you change her salary?  Would you readjust her salary according to her status?"  And he said, "No, she will still make $350 or $450 a week."  And my mother, it didn't settle too well with her about that.  So, he and my mother, they both decided, well let's just forget it.  However, I did go to [Las] Vegas [Nevada].  He went on to Vegas, and we went to Vegas and I sang with them again in Vegas.  So he did want me, but I never, I didn't want to sign--we didn't want to sign a contract that would keep me tied up for ten years.  And I believe it was the right thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds as if it is.  I mean your mother really seemed to be on top of this.
Speaker 2: Oh, my mother was smart, she was just smart.  However, she didn't foresee what was going to happen with Motown.  (Laughter) But who knows, you know?  I believe--first of all, it's my faith.  My faith and my belief in God is what comforts me, and believing and knowing that I wasn't supposed to be there, it wasn't my place.  I wasn't supposed, that wasn't my destiny.
Story_ID: 261324
Speaker 1: What happened next?  Where did you go?
Speaker 2: I went to New York [New York], I went to New York.  I was eighteen, and that's when I met [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, what happened?
Speaker 2: He called me up and he said, "I'm going to the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] with Billy Eckstine and my band, my big band, and Redd Foxx, along with [Charles] Coles and [Charles "Cholly"] Atkins, the dance team."  He says, "I would like you to be on the show."  And so, I did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you sing solo in show?
Speaker 2: Yeah, with the band.  And at that time, I remember The Supremes were just really hitting it off.  They were having, they were starting to have hits.  And I really 'Baby Love.'  He said, "I want you to do 'Baby Love.'"  I said, "Why?"  He said, "Because that's The Supremes, that's the big number one."  He said, "I want you to do 'Baby Love,'" and I did that.  I did 'Baby Love,' 'One Mint Julep,' 'Secret Love,' I remember singing 'Secret Love.'  And these are all the arrangements he got for me.  And I remember at the Apollo I was at my dressing room.  I was on the third floor, and I heard Dinah Washington backstage.  And she was saying, she says, "Yeah--." I heard them talking, I was just listening.  And she said, "Yeah, ain't that my arrangement you using?"  (Laughter) And she was talking to everybody and getting on him about using her arrangement.  She said, "You stole my arrangement."  (Laughter) And it was, it was.  He had copied it and let Billy, I think Billy Byers did that arrangement.  And then Quincy did 'Mint Julep,' and that was almost the same identical one that I think Ray Charles had done.  And also, Sarah Vaughn did it, she did a cover on it.
Speaker 1: Now, those were the days when--I think ASCAP [American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers] (unclear) rules, well it's a little more stringent now, in terms of what you can with somebody else's song or something now.  Am I right or wrong?
Speaker 2: I don't know, because people do--you can do a cover, you know.  Like if you do a song, it doesn't mean that nobody else can do it, you know, as long as the writers get paid and the publisher gets paid.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: And this wasn't a recording, this was a live show.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, how long did you tour with Quincy Jones?
Speaker 2: We did some shows.  We did the Apollo and then we did the Regal [Theater] in Chicago [Illinois].  And that was just like a day, you know, it wasn't like a long tour.  You know, we just did the Apollo and then we did the Regal.  And then a year later he asked me to do the Apollo again.
Speaker 1: Now, what timeframe are you talking about now?  This is the early '60s [1960s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're talking about--
Speaker 1: When did you start the tour with Quincy Jones, when did you start?
Speaker 2: I think it was '64 [1964].  I think was about '64 [1964].
Story_ID: 261325
Speaker 1: So you did the Regal [Theater, Chicago, Illinois] and then you did the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] again?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the next time it was still with Billy Eckstine, he was the headliner.  Because you know, Billy was big back then, and he was even bigger before then.  You know, but he was still big in the '60s [1960s].  And then the comedian was Nipsey Russell.  And was it [Charles] Coles and [Charles "Cholly"] Atkins again?  Oh, the Four Tops.  The Four Tops were on that show.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the Four Tops were just coming off, coming into their first hit, 'Baby I Need Your Loving,' because they sang it on the show.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, they're a Motown act, but they were--
Speaker 2: They had just, they were new.  They were new then; they were new.  And [HistoryMaker] Berry [Gordy] had signed them and put the record out, 'Baby I Need Your Loving.'  And, yeah.  And then I worked, see, I worked with the Four Tops before then, before they even had, before they got with Motown.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were they a Detroit [Michigan] group, too?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're a Detroit group.  I worked with the Four Tops in Brooklyn [New York, New York] at a club called the Elegante.  It was owned by these Italian guys.  And the guy that owned it became my manager, Joe Scandore.  And the Four Tops were on the show.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, yeah, because the Four Tops, they were performing when they were teens, in their teens.  They were in their teens performing.  And I remember in Idlewild [Michigan], we had a cottage.  We used to have a cottage in Idlewild, Michigan.  And my parents [Charsilee Hickman Farley and Sam Farley], they used to go the matinees, and they would let people bring their kids to the matinee.  And the name of the club was called the Fiesta [Fiesta Room at the Paradise Club, Idlewild, Michigan], owned by Arthur Braggs [sic. Herman Wilson and Lela Wilson].  And they would take, we would go to the matinee to see the floorshow.  And the headliner would be like [HistoryMaker] Della Reese[-Lett].  The headliner would be someone like Della Reese, and then they'd have the Four Tops.  And they had a chorus, a line of dancers.  And they had a comedian, Slappy White, or somebody like that.  And sometimes they'd have a shake dancer.  And they would let kids come to the, you know, come to the show.  They'd have food and everything, it was nice.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Idlewild was like a black version of the Catskills [New York] or something.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  It was a black resort, it was a black summer resort.  It was like, because people from, the people that came there were from Detroit [Michigan]--primarily Detroit, Cleveland [Ohio], all over Ohio, Chicago [Illinois], and different parts of Michigan.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Story_ID: 261326
Speaker 1: Larry Steele's 'Smart Affairs' (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I worked with Larry Steele.  I worked with Larry Steele quite a bit.  I worked with Larry Steele in Atlantic City [New Jersey] at the Club Harlem.  I worked with Larry Steele's 'Smart Affairs' in [Las] Vegas [Nevada] at the Thunderbird [Hotel], which no longer exists, which was a hotel, a big hotel that was torn down. I worked the Thunderbird with Larry Steele.
Speaker 1: That was a black hotel, right?
Speaker 2: No, it was not.
Speaker 1: It was not?
Speaker 2: There were no black hotels on the [Las Vegas] Strip [Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were no black hotels on the Strip.
Speaker 1: Wasn't there a black venue in Las Vegas for black performers?
Speaker 2: On the Westside [Las Vegas, Nevada].  They called it the Dust Bbowl back then.  And my first experience going to Vegas was when I was seventeen, with my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] and Matt Ferguson.  We had driven from Detroit [Michigan] to Vegas, and we arrived very tired.  And we kept driving up and down the Strip seeing signs, motel signs, saying vacancy.  Matt would go in and then come back and say, "They say they have no vacancy.  They say they have no vacancy."  I said, "But it says vacancy."  So I don't know whether it was somebody being dumb, or we just didn't want to admit it.  Because we were from Detroit, you know, we weren't from the South.  So, finally we run across this black guy, who was like I think a security guard or something like that.  And I say, "What's up, what's going on?  We can't find any place to stay."  He said, "Well, don't you know?  They don't let us stay on the Strip."  I said, "But we thought it was okay out here."  He said, "Naw, they don't let us stay on the Strip."  This was like probably '62 [1962], '61 [1961].  He said, "No, they don't let us stay on the Strip."  He said, "All the black folks stay on the Westside.  They call it the Dust Bowl."  So, then my mother said, "Well, we're here for Duke Ellington, and my daughter's supposed to be singing with his band.  Isn't he staying at the Riviera Hotel [Las Vegas, Nevada]?"  He said, "No, ma'am."  He said, "They're all staying at the West Motel [ph.] owned by Dr. [Charles] West."  And he said, he says, "Duke's over there."  And that's where they were, and that's where we got a room.  (Laughter) We got our rooms over there.
Speaker 1: Now, a lot of people, you know, find that hard to believe, but that's the way things were.
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah, oh, yeah.  Back then, all the blacks stayed on the Westside.  And then there was, and there was a casino and a hotel over there.  And there was the West Motel, there was the Moulin Rouge [Las Vegas, Nevada], and then there was, they had a casino over there and all like that.  But I mean they could come over to the, they could come to the Strip and gamble.  And there were certain hotels that were kind of like off, kind of like considered very, you know, what do you call it?  Very, very, not so lenient.  And that was, like the Desert Inn [Las Vegas, Nevada] was one, very white.
Speaker 1: So, even the black royalty of music--Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Billy Eckstine, Nancy Wilson, those kind of people had to stay in--
Speaker 2: Well, at that point, Nancy I think was just getting started.
Speaker 1: Right, right, that's true.
Speaker 2: Nancy was just getting started.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She wasn't, at that point, Nancy was not, had not made her entrance as a known singer at that point.
Speaker 1: But the biggest names in black music ended up not staying on the Las Vegas Strip?
Speaker 2: Correct.  Now, I've got to find, I need to talk with [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.  Have you ever done Eartha Kitt?  I need to speak with her, because she was actually headlining when I was there.  I remember, because she was at the El Rancho [Vegas, Las Vegas, Nevada] headlining.  And I remember when the El Rancho burned down, we were there.  And I'm wondering if she was like one of the exceptions.  I'm just wondering, I'm just, it just occurred to me.
Speaker 1: Now, there's always an exception.
Speaker 2: And then again, we were just regular people.  She was a big star, Eartha Kitt was big then.  So, we were just regular ordinary people.  So maybe they said, "Well, y'all can't stay here, but you know, maybe she can stay." (Laughter) But then I heard--you know the play that was out a little while ago called 'Dinah Was,' it was a play about Dinah Washington.  They actually have a scene where they said that Dinah was headlining, was on the Strip, and that she was, they had to--like she had a trailer, like she was--she finally broke the color line by insisting that she had to stay in the hotel or something like that, but then they gave her a trailer or something.  It was something, some mess like that.  Yeah, it was some mess like that.  Yeah, well, I remember we couldn't stay on--all I'm telling you is that we couldn't stay on the Strip.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was like, about 1961.
Story_ID: 261327
Speaker 1: We're up to--the [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones tour was in '64 [1964], '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, '64 [1964].  And so, how long did you stay with Quincy Jones, his tour?
Speaker 2: It wasn't long.  This was just like, these were like just engagements, like, okay, a week at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] or a week at the Regal Theater [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It wasn't like a long--like here, here, here, and here.  It wasn't that long.
Speaker 1: So, when they got a big gig, they gathered the group?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he and his big band and the, you know, different acts.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now in the mid-'60s [1960s], this is like the height of the Motown popularity.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when they finally bursted out.
Speaker 1: In Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You say you never felt like, "Well, maybe I should have--."
Speaker 2: Because of all the other stuff I used to hear, and the way they ran Motown--[HistoryMaker] Berry [Gordy] was a real tyrant.  And I had, I mean, I'm real friendly, I mean we're very--I'm very cordial, and they're very cordial with me.  Berry's very cordial with me to this day.  It's like he still considers me family, because it's like I'm part of his history, and he's part of mine.  And he might have been mad at me for a while, and I'm sure he was, and my mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] was sure.  But I think that it's just one of those things where, you know, he respects me, and I respect him.  Because let me tell you, here's a man that back then when we were going through our relationship, our encounter, no one would have, could have told--if someone told us what was going to happen with  him, we would have said, "You got to be crazy.  What are you talking about?  That's not going to happen."  Because nobody knew.  Nothing like that had ever happened to black people before that.  So, he, at that point when his career started to open up and Motown started to blossom, and you know, explode--to become the gigantic success that it became--nobody knew.  They didn't even know.  And I'm sure when you talk to people who like started out with Motown, they didn't know how big they were going to become.  They were just doing it because they loved it and they wanted it, and it was better than doing, than working at Hudson's [J.L. Hudson Company, Detroit, Michigan] or maybe at Ford [Motor Company, Detroit, Michigan], you know.  And it was happening, and it was exciting, and it was fun.  And they just felt like, hey, this is great, you know.  And nobody really, I don't think they realized the kind of impact that they were going to make on the world, not just the country, but the entire world.
Story_ID: 261328
Speaker 1: Now, when did you start making records?  Did you appear on any of the Duke Ellington songs?
Speaker 2: No, I never did any recording, no, I never did that.
Speaker 1: With [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones?
Speaker 2: I never recorded with Quincy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, when did you do your first recording?
Speaker 2: My first professional recording, I was 19, 20.  I was 19 or 20, and it was on, I got a record contract with ABC-Paramount [Records] in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, this is about 1962?
Speaker 2: About, yeah, 1962 I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right after I went to New York.
Speaker 1: And what was the name of your album?
Speaker 2: It was called 'After the Lights Go Down Low and Much More!!!.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) As a matter of fact you can get it today, but it's like a Japanese import, on CD.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, so, what was the response to this album?  I mean, how did--
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't a hit.  It was, you know, I don't know how much it sold or anything like that.  I didn't really check on that.
Speaker 1: It sounds like the song's a mellow kind of song.
Speaker 2: They were all jazz tunes.  The label, by the way, was Impulse! [Records], which is like Blue Note [Records].
Speaker 1: Yeah, Impulse! is, it had one of the--
Speaker 2: Impulse! was a very serious, very serious, you know, jazz label.
Speaker 1: That's right, Impulse!, right.  That's the label that produced John Coltrane.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 261329
Speaker 1: Okay, we're talking about the Impulse! [Records] record, 'After the Lights Go Down Low [And Much More!!!].'  Now, did you do more after that, more albums?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, sure.  That was the first album.  When I got the record deal, I had a single first.  The single was called 'Slightly Out of Tune,' which was from the instrumental hit, 'Desafinado' by Stan Getz.  And then after I did my Impulse! album, my next album was done in Stockholm, Sweden, and it was called 'Freda Payne in Stockholm.'
Speaker 1: When was that?
Speaker 2: That was in 1965.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then after that, my next album ["Freda Payne"]--
Speaker 1: Was it jazz too, basically?
Speaker 2: Well, it was more middle of the road.  Because I did stuff like 'Broadway,' like 'On Broadway.'  So, I did a combination of sort of middle of the road stuff--not so much jazz, but middle of the road.  My next recording was on MGM [Records], and this was in 1966.  And it was album that was produced by Tom Wilson with arrangements by Benny Golson.  And the title [track] of that was, 'How Do You Say I Don't Love you Anymore.'  And that was like, you know, from 'How Do You Say I Don't Love You Anymore.'  And I did songs like 'You've Lost that Loving Feeling,' ['You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling'] 'Feeling Good,' 'Let it Be Me,' 'If you Love Me, Really Love Me,' 'Let it Happen I Don't Care,' [sic.] and a  couple of songs that weren't really well-known that were kind of obscure, but really nice.  So, it was just a very lovely album.  It was very nice, very lovely.
Speaker 1: Did you, were you starting to develop fans?
Speaker 2: I think probably by that time, yeah, yeah, I thought.  But not a lot, not--like 'Band of Gold' was the big thing.  But like--
Speaker 1: You know, but you know, well, even when I was young and would go in the record store, sometimes you would look for something that nobody else has heard of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --and go home and play it, and say "Oh, that person's really good."
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: It's exciting to be on the ground floor of something, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's during the time--that time was when I was being booked on 'The Tonight Show [Starring Johnny Carson'].  It was 'The Tonight Show' with Johnny Carson.
Story_ID: 261330
Speaker 1: Tell me about, now, tell me about the first time you were on a national TV show.  Which one was it?
Speaker 2: Other than the talent contest, it was ['The Tonight Show Starring] Johnny Carson,' it was Johnny Carson.
Speaker 1: That must have been exciting.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened?  They just, did they see you--
Speaker 2: I had a--because my manager--I was with Joe Scandore, who was this Italian guy who owned a nightclub in Brooklyn [New York, New York] called the Elegante.  And because of him, he used to get me booked on 'The Tonight Show' a lot.  And they liked me, so they had me on quite frequently; I was on there quite frequently.  I remember one of the 'Tonight Shows' I was on was with [Reverend] Dr. Martin Luther King [Jr.].  And [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte was on that show, I remember.
Speaker 1: Did you get a chance to talk to them, or really--
Speaker 2: Oh, I met, well, I met them on a couple of other occasions.  I got to meet Dr. King.  Once I met him in Chicago [Illinois] at an affair where it was a luncheon and he was there.  And he spoke, and he came to the luncheon and I met him.  And then in [Las] Vegas [Nevada] I met him--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, we had you on 'The Tonight Show.'  Now how did, you say your agent--
Speaker 1: My manager.
Speaker 2: Your manager.
Speaker 1: His name was Joe Scandore.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And it was Joe Scandore, and he used to get me booked on 'The Tonight Show.'
Speaker 2: And when was your first appearance on 'The Tonight Show'?
Speaker 1: Now, don't let me--I cannot quote you the exact date, but I can approximate.  It must have been around '63 [1963], around '63 [1963] or '62 [1962], '62 [1962], or '63 [1963].  But I did, I used to be on 'The Tonight Show' like, let's see, out of the year, maybe three or four or five or six times a year.
Speaker 2: That's something, yeah.  Well, those were the days when enough black folks were finally coming on television, where we didn't, you know, there were just more on TV than ever before I guess.  They were starting to--
Speaker 1: Yeah, there wasn't that many.
Speaker 2: If you were on a show, it would be unprecedented to have maybe two black folks on the same show.  (Laughter) You were on a show with Harry Belafonte and Dr. King.
Speaker 1: Dr. King.  But that was unusual, because that was like special, to me, like a special show.  And Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] was there.  I think it was Dr. King, Belafonte, Andy Young, and [Ralph] Abernathy.
Speaker 2: Were they talking about the March [on Washington]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they--whatever it was.  I mean it was like, I think they may have been; they may have been, yeah.
Speaker 2: It makes you wonder if it was around that time.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Perhaps it was after the march or before the march or something.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  But then I was on the show many times.  I was on, I was on--one of 'The Tonight Shows' I was on was when Johnny Carson first came to California in Burbank [California].  And they were going to be, they were just trying it out, like for two weeks.  They were here for two weeks and then they went back to New York [New York], and then they came back, finally came back permanently.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But those first two weeks they came out here, I think that was, might have been around '64 [1964].  Those first two weeks they came out here, I was on once each week.  And the first show, the guests were Marlon Brando, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Howard Duff, and Ida Lupino.  And I remember Marlon Brando invited me, he said, "Would you like a ride home?"  Because he had a limo.  And I said, "Yes, but I'm working in a club.  You can drop me off at Slate Brothers on La Cienega Boulevard [Los Angeles, California]."  And he dropped me off, and a week later it was in Dorothy Kilgallen's column (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, that you all were an item or something (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, now were you staying in Los Angeles [California] then?
Speaker 1: Well, I wasn't living here, no.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But I was actually living with some friends of my parents [Charsilee Hickman Farley and Sam Farley].  My stepfather, Sam Farley, he had some friends from his hometown, you know, from Louisiana.  And they lived here, and they let--they were--I was staying with them.  So, I was staying with a family.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The Wilkersons [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Joseph Wilkerson.
Speaker 2: That's good, you know.
Speaker 1: Joseph and Annie Wilkerson [ph.].
Speaker 2: Now, was Los Angeles as segregated as Las Vegas [Nevada] in those days?
Speaker 1: No, no, not that I remember.
Story_ID: 261331
Speaker 1: So you were on 'The Tonight Show [Starring Johnny Carson]' quite a few times?  What about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh.  And then '[The] Merv Griffin [Show].'
Speaker 1: --Merv Griffin?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, that was another one.
Speaker 1: He had an afternoon show, basically.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  He had a show very similar to 'The Tonight Show,' only it came on in the afternoon, not at night.  And it was a very successful show.  Merv Griffin had a good show.
Speaker 1: Right, it was a much watched show.  Most people watched Merv Griffin when they came home from school, or--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, 'The Merv Griffin Show.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he'd have different artists.  As a matter of fact, the first time I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger was on 'The Merv Griffin Show,' in the green room (laughter).
Speaker 1: I remember the show he was on.  He was Mr. USA.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was Mr. Universe or something like that.  Remember, he was all puffed up, probably on his steroids then.  He looked like the Neanderthal Man.  (Laughter) Now, he's our governor, of course, and very refined, you know, not buff like a bodybuilder like he used to be.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what other shows were you on?
Speaker 2: Dick Cavett.
Speaker 1: Dick Cavett.
Speaker 2: I did 'The Dick Cavett Show.'  I did David Frost, 'The David Frost Show,' he had a talk show.
Speaker 1: Those were like afternoon shows, too, really.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, David Frost--I'm trying to remember--it was at night, I think.  David Frost was at night.  And Dick Cavett--
Speaker 1: Did you do Jack Paar at all?
Speaker 2: No, he was a little before me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was just a little before me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when was it that you signed with Invictus Records?
Speaker 2: I signed with Invictus in the late '60s [1960s], yeah.
Speaker 1: In 1968 or something?
Speaker 2: I signed the contract in '68 [1968].  And I didn't have a record come out until late 1969.
Story_ID: 261332
Speaker 1: Now, since you had met and you kind of knew [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] on some level--Dr. King died in '68 [1968].  Do you remember what you were doing when Dr. King was killed?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, I most certainly do.  When he was killed, I was doing a play called 'Lost in the Stars,' by Kurt Weill, 'Lost in the Stars.'  And it was at the Equity [Library Theater, New York, New York] on 103rd [Street] on the west side. And I lived on West, Central Park West, on 97th Street.  And I was doing the play, and I remember he had gotten shot, we knew he'd gotten shot.  We were in the theater working.  And I remember we were all in the dressing room, and had a radio on.  And when they announced that he died, I screamed.  And somebody said, "Be quiet, you know, the show's going on."  And when I went home that night, I walked home, and I saw some guys jumping on a white guy.  And then I shared an apartment--I had a roommate [Sandra McPherson]--on the nineteenth floor, and our windows faced Harlem [New York, New York], and I could see fires.  I could see the glow of fires burning in Harlem.  I saw it, it was bad.
Story_ID: 261333
Speaker 1: We skipped over something I shouldn't have skipped over.  And that's your, I guess, moving to New York [New York] and being in a Broadway show.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were with, you were an understudy for Leslie Uggams--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 'Hallelujah Baby!.'  That's like '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: That was 1967.
Speaker 1: Right, that's the year before [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed.  And--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Because after 'Hallelujah Baby!,' that's when I did 'Lost in the Stars' [Kurt Weill].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I'm sorry I let you skip over that.  But how did that happen?  This is your first Broadway show, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my first Broadway show.  What happened was, like I said, I had a roommate.  She was, she was a dancer. She just passed away, Sandra McPherson.  And she was a dancer on Broadway, and also had a nightclub act with Tommy Johnson.  And so she kept telling me, "[HistoryMaker] Freda [Payne], you need to audition."  Like Emily Yancy was the understudy at the time.  She started out, she was the first understudy.  She said, "Emily's leaving the show, because she just got a part in 'Hello Dolly!,' starring Pearl Bailey and Cab Calloway on Broadway.  And she said, "They're going to be auditioning understudies, so you should audition."  I said, "Oh, I can't do that."  I said, "I don't know how to act."  She says, "Yes, you can."  She says, "Leslie, they went to--Leslie was singing in nightclubs when they found her."  She said, "She wasn't an actress, you know, so it's the same thing."  She says, "You can do it."  So, she kept bugging me, and I said, "Okay, okay, I'll audition."  So, I auditioned.  I didn't get it that time.  A girl by the name of Norma Donaldson got it.  So, I said, "See."  She said, "But, well, they told me they loved you, but they weren't quite sure if you were, you know, of maybe your experience or whatever, you know."  Because an understudy has to like take over the role, you know, of that person if they can't--if they have to, if anything happens to them.  So, Norma Donaldson held the job for about two months.  And then she said, "They're letting Norma go, because you know, they felt that they wanted somebody a little stronger."  And so, they held auditions again.  So, she said, she said, "Freda, you've got to audition."  I said, "Girl, I can't do it, I told you."  She said, "No, they really like you.  They really, they want to see you again."  So, what happened was she got Billy Dee Williams to come and work with me.  Because we were all, you know, everybody was just, you know, doing their thing.  And nobody was really a star or anything like that.  We were just all doing the same, we were all in the same boat.  So, she says, "I'm going to get Billy Dee."  She says, "He'll do it, he'll do it.  He's cool, you know."  So he came up to the apartment and he started reading with me, and just telling me, "Okay, do it like this, say it like this," and kind of giving me tips.  And we're just reading back and forth, like a rehearsal.  The next day I auditioned, and I got hired.  And Billy Dee was also, he was a stand-in for [HistoryMaker] Robert Hooks, who was the star, the male lead with Leslie.  And Robert Hooks was doing 'N.Y.P.D.,' the very first, the beginning of 'N.Y.P.D.', when they were doing it in black and white.  Robert Hooks was the first one to do it.  So, he was doing double-duty.  He was doing Broadway and episodic TV at the same time.  And I got the role--the role, the understudy.  Well, as fate would have it, three and a half weeks after I was hired, they told me I was going on.  And so I had to, I had to really like get it together, you know.  And I went on.  Of course, I had like a week's notice that I was going on.  Because I think Leslie had to have some, a little operation, you know, a little procedure done, and she had to take off for that one day.  So, I was able to call my parents [Charsilee Hickman Farley and Sam Farley] and they came in for it.  My parents and [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne], they all flew in for it.  I don't know if they drove or what, but anyway, they came in.  And I went on, and when the show was finished I got a standing ovation.  So anyway, as a consequence, to make a long story short, I went on five times before the show closed; I went on five times.
Speaker 1: Well, that's good.  That was a--I remember that show, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Leslie won, she won a Tony.  She won a Tony Award [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre].
Story_ID: 261334
Speaker 1: So you went from that show ['Hallelujah Baby!'] to the one in '68 [1968] with Kurt Weill?
Speaker 2: Then I went, I did 'Lost in the Stars' after that.
Speaker 1: 'Lost in the Stars.'  Okay, okay.  And so, what happened after '68 [1968], after 'Lost in the Stars'?
Speaker 2: After '68 [1968], after 'Lost in the Stars'--
Speaker 1: Is that when you started recording for--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when I--right, because that's when--what happened, in '68 [1968] that's when I got a call, that's when Brian Holland popped up.  And he said, "What are you doing, what's going on?"  I said, "Well, I'm just, I mean I'm doing stuff, you know."  He said, "Well, do you have a manager?"  I had just gotten out of, my contract had just ended with Joe Scandore.  I said, "No."  He said, "Are you signed with a label?"  I had just finished my deal with ABC-Paramount [Records].  I said, "No, I'm not with ABC-Paramount anymore."  He said, "Do you want to come with us?"  I said, "I thought you were with Motown."  He said, "No, we're leaving Motown.  We're forming our own label, and we're going to call it Invictus [Records] in Detroit [Michigan].  And we want you, do you think, you know, would you want to come with us?"  I said, "Yeah," you know.  So I flew to Detroit and sat down and talked, and we signed contracts.  And the rest is history.
Speaker 1: Invictus, I was just thinking.  Why the name Invictus?
Speaker 2: You know who came up with the title Invictus?  What's her name?  [Ruth] Copeland, she was an artist on Invictus. God, what's that girl's name?  Nothing ever happened. You know, she never really, nothing ever happened.  Like, she never really, like I think she should have become bigger.
Speaker 1: Isn't that a poem, "Black as the night that covers me as the pits from pole to pole--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --I thank whatever gods may be for my immortal, my unconquerable soul" ['Invictus,' William Ernest Henley].
Speaker 2: Right, that's right, right.  But it's a white woman who came up with that, I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's where it came from.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That gave them the idea.
Speaker 1: So, this time, Motown [Records] was (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And if I'm wrong, I stand to be corrected (laughter).
Story_ID: 261335
Speaker 1: So Motown [Records] is kind of, you know, [HistoryMaker] Berry Gordy at this point he's got his sights on Hollywood, I mean.  Right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah.  Then he was just, he was just--yeah, right.  And also there was a lot of skullduggery going on back then.  When the Holland brothers [Brian Holland and Eddie Holland], when Holland-Dozier-Holland left, it wasn't a friendly thing, it wasn't an amicable thing.  It was kind of like, that's when they, that was the beginning of the lawsuits.  That's when they sued Motown and then Motown sued them.  And they had a lawsuit, I think they had on-gain off-again lawsuit that's lasted thirty years.
Speaker 1: Holland-Holland-Dozier, you know, was responsible for all The Supremes' hits--
Speaker 2: All of the big Supreme hits that mattered, and all the Four Top hits, all of them.  And I think, some of [HistoryMaker] Martha Reeves and some other artists there.  They had like some of the major stuff, they had the major stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so they decided to form their own label in '68 [1968].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And also, they had another label called Hot Wax [Records], Hot Wax.
Speaker 1: So, did their deal seem pretty good to you at the time?
Speaker 2: You mean their contract?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: It was okay at the time, for the time being.  It wasn't, it wasn't--it was okay.  I mean I've learned now not to, like, be so skeptical or critical of things.  Because when you start, when you hear about it again, or if you read it, it sounds and it looks worse than it really is.  I've learned the hard way.  So, like they say, it's like that old saying, "If you can't say nothing nice, don't say nothing at all (laughter)."
Story_ID: 261336
Speaker 1: So, what records did you make for Invictus [Records]?  I mean, did you get a big hit?
Speaker 2: What records?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You want me to get one of them CDs and name off the songs?
Speaker 1: No, just--well, I know the biggest ones but this is history so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, 'Band of Gold'--
Speaker 1: 'Band of Gold.'
Speaker 2: 'Bring the Boys Home,' 'Cherish What is Dear to You,' 'Deeper and Deeper,' 'You Brought the Joy,' 'The Easiest Way to Fall,' 'The Road We Didn't Take,' those are some of them.
Speaker 1: So these are really the golden years of your recording, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah, those were the golden years of the Invictus era.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Of my time with Invictus.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 261337
Speaker 1: That's when you became famous as a solo act, and you became really big.
Speaker 2: That was my break.  That was like my breakthrough, like when I became internationally known.  Because then, it wasn't just the United States.  I was, my record was number one for six weeks straight in the UK [United Kingdom].  That's all over England, Scotland, Wales, you know, Ireland, and France.  It was a hit all over, you know.
Speaker 1: You're talking about 'Band of Gold'?
Speaker 2: 'Band of Gold.'
Speaker 1: Now 'Band of Gold' is an interesting record, because the lyrics are kind of strange.  Most records are not about you know, failed attempts to make love.  It's kind of--you had some reservations about it, right, when you first--
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I first--Ron Dunbar, who is one of the writers of 'Band of Gold,' he was the first person to show me the lyrics and play the track.  And I said, "Well, the track sound is cooking."  I said, "The track is great."  I said, "But these lyrics," I said, "What do you mean, 'But that night on our honeymoon we stayed in separate rooms?'" I said, "What's that all about?"  He said, "Well, that's because the girl has a problem and can't get it together."  I said, "That's stupid."  I said, "I wouldn't do that.  This is for a fifteen-year old to sing."  (Laughter) He said, "Don't worry about it.  You don't have to like it, just sing it (laughter)."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it was weird.  I think when I first heard it, a lot of people said "What in the world is this about?"  You know, but it was a big hit.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: A big hit record.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a big hit.
Speaker 1: A huge hit.  So, were you ever called upon to explain the lyrics?
Speaker 2: Oh, many times, many times.  (Laughter) As the writer of the song told me, he said it was about--a lot of people used to think--more people thought it was the man.  But it's really, it was the girl.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I thought it was the man, too.  I thought he had the problem.
Speaker 2: No, it was the girl, frigidity.  Like that's what Ron Dunbar told me, that it was about the girl being frigid, which makes sense.
Speaker 1: That's amazing, because most people think it's about the guy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.  Maybe he just didn't want to really tell me the truth (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, it just seems strange.  It seems like, it's kind of a strange combination.  Because you were one of the most--and I speak for probably a lot of people--the most glamorous of the singers to emerge, in terms of your looks and everything.
Speaker 2: At the time.
Speaker 1: And I'm not just saying that because we're interviewing you now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But it's true, it's true, you really are.  I mean people--you were widely photographed, and people really, you know, thought you were gorgeous, you know.  Yeah, it was a hit record.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was, that was it, it happened for me.  And I will always be eternally grateful.
Story_ID: 261338
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what happened next [after 'Band of Gold']?  What was--it was hit after hit for a while, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, and then they put out 'Deeper and Deeper' and that didn't do so hot, it was all right.  And then they put out 'Bring the Boys Home,' and then that did it.  That caused a little controversy as well.
Speaker 1: This is '71 [1971] now, right?
Speaker 2: Seventy-one [1971].  We were in Vietnam, still at war.  And the Republican Party did not take too fondly to 'Bring the Boys Home.'  They thought that it was inflammatory.  They felt that it was--they sent, they actually sent a telegram to the record company [Invictus Records], and said that my record would not be played in South Vietnam, because it was giving aid and comfort to the enemy.  And of course, the record became, that record became a hit much faster than 'Band of Gold.'  That became a hit much faster than 'Band of Gold.'  It went right--just like that.  But strangely enough, it was never a hit overseas, and obviously because they weren't at war.  And it was more, I think it was a bigger hit and it was more, better received by blacks for some reason.  Because more black people relate to it, for some reason.  More black people tell me that they love 'Bring the Boys Home.'  It was like, "[HistoryMaker] Freda Payne, bring the boys home."
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was the most outspoken of the black--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, the black records, and we focused on it more.  And I think if you go back--I can remember The Dells did, 'Does Anybody Know I'm Here?' which was about the war.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that's what--
Speaker 1: And then 'What's Going On' by Marvin Gaye.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all that.
Speaker 1: But 'Bring the Boys Home' was more of a strong statement about it.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Well, did you have any reservations about doing that song?
Speaker 2: Not at all, not at all.  To me, it was a good song.  It brought tears to my eyes when I first heard it, you know, the demo.  And I wanted to do it, most definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are the lyrics?  Just, maybe you can just--what are the lyrics?
Speaker 2: "Fathers are pleading, lovers are all alone.  Mothers are praying, send our sons back home.  You marched them away on fields and plains to fight a war, facing death in vain.  Bring the boys home, bring them back alive.  Cease all fire on the battlefield.  Enough men have already been wounded and killed.  Bring the boys home, bring them back alive.  Turn the ships around, lay your weapons down.  Can't you see them marching cross the sky, all the soldiers that have died?  They're trying to get home, trying to get home, trying to get home.  (Singing) Bring the boys home (laughter)."
Story_ID: 261339
Speaker 1: Now, there have been--we were saying off-camera there were several--well, a couple of remakes of 'Bring the Boys Home.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My 'Bring the Boys Home' from the year of 1971--well, first of all I did two remakes on it.  The first one I did was like a couple of years ago, like 2003.  And it was done with the producer Preston Glass, where I just did it again, but a new version, where I kind of like modified the lyrics a little bit, just to make it a little less aggressive towards like the [Vietnam] War, you know.  And then, I did another one that was done last year, last June.  And we went into Capitol Records, Studio A, and we brought in forty children from the ages of six to thirteen.  And they did the background, "Bring them back alive, bring the boys home, bring them back alive."  And then I brought in a male singer who was, his name is Carl Thomas.  And he's signed to Bad Boy Records, which is P. Diddy's [Sean Combs] record label.  And he did the male, like, the male vocals with me.  And then during the instrumental break I had a rapper, the first time.  We never used, there was never any rapper before.  We had a rapper by the name of Won-G [Bruny] doing the rapping.  And I made sure the lyrics--the lyrics changed yet another time, just a little bit.  So we threw in, "Bring the troops home, bring them back alive.  Bring the girls home, bring them back alive.  Bring our children home, bring them back alive.  Bring them all home, bring them back alive."  You know, so I just changed little things like that.  I tried to get it done, I tried to get it done, to sing and perform it and present it at the [2004] Democratic [National] Convention [Boston, Massachusetts] last August, and nothing happened.  And I thought that would have been a perfect vehicle.  But then of course, we know John Kerry was not advocating bring the boys home at the time.  He had the, he was going along with program, and I guess his hands were tied.  So, they were afraid of the song.
Speaker 1: He didn't win.
Speaker 2: No, he didn't, sorry.  I voted for him, I'm a Democrat.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Because you know, some say, you know, that the campaign wasn't as strident enough, and it wasn't clear enough, you know.  So, that's the way it--
Speaker 2: Well, that's what happens I guess when you walk the fence.  You know, like trying to balance, like "Oh, don't let me offend these people, and don't let me offend these people like woah, you know (laughter)."
Story_ID: 261340
Speaker 1: So, what other hits since we're talking about them.  That was a really a big one, and--
Speaker 2: Well, after that ['Bring the Boys Home'], I don't think I had too many.  I didn't have any more after that.  I had 'Deeper and Deeper' and then I had 'Cherish What Is Dear to You,' 'You Brought the Joy,' you know.
Speaker 1: You did some movies, too.
Speaker 2: I did movies.  I did the 'Book of Numbers' with Raymond St. Jacques, and Philip Michael Thomas, and D'Urville Martin.
Speaker 1: That was about, was that about the numbers?
Speaker 2: It was about the numbers racket, yeah, in Dallas, in Dallas, Texas.
Speaker 1: That's right.  I remember seeing that movie, yeah, I saw that.
Speaker 2: That was during the blaxploitation period.  But I think when it came out it was a little better than the typical black--it was like a little, a little above that.  You know, it got good reviews, because it wasn't like a blaxploitation film
Speaker 1: And it wasn't dependent upon the music and, you know, that sort of thing, and fashion.  It seemed like it was kind of a period piece about the numbers.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Well, what else?  Anything else?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Well, I did a lot of stuff with, I worked with Sammy Davis, Jr. a lot after that.  And--
Speaker 1: On stage doing--
Speaker 2: Yeah, live performances, yeah.  And the TV show. Remember Sammy did a show, he had a TV show.  And I did that show.  Then I got a record deal with ABC Records in, was it '74 [1974]?
Story_ID: 261341
Speaker 1: Now, what happened with Invictus [Records]?
Speaker 2: Well, I actually sued Invictus, that's what happened.  You said what happened with the hits.  That's what happened, I sued Invictus, and we had a lawsuit that went on for about almost two years.  And that's what eventually--that's what eventually brought me out here [Los Angeles, California], because I got, my attorneys were out here.  I got attorneys here, I secured them.  And they said "We'll sue, we'd rather sue here than Detroit [Michigan], because they have more power on their home base, you know.  Let them come out here."  And that's what I did.  It was resolved after about almost two years.  And I went back, and I recorded one more album.  It was called 'Reaching Out.'
Story_ID: 261342
Speaker 1: I don't want to skip over anything, so don't let me do it.  But I know that you hosted a talk show.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.  But that's coming, that's like in the '80s [1980s].  That was like 1981.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, let's go back to whatever I missed.  Now, what are you--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Then I did--okay, I was with ABC Records, and I did two albums for them.  And the first one was called 'Payne and Pleasure,' and that was produced by McKinley Jackson, but Lamont Dozier had a lot to do with it as well.  And then the second one was called 'Out of Payne Comes Love,' produced by Bob Monaco.  Bob Monaco had produced Rufus, you know, with Chaka Khan.  Then after that, I went with Capitol Records in '76 [1976].  And I did three albums on Capitol, 'Stares and Whispers,' 'Supernatural High,' and 'Red Hot.'  And then I did another musical.  Then by '79 [1979], I did a musical called 'Daddy Goodness.'  And--
Speaker 1: Is this on Broadway?
Speaker 2: It was headed for Broadway.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We started out in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] at the Forest [Theater], and then we went to Washington, D.C. and we played at The National [Theatre].  And then we were supposed to open at the Winter Garden [New York, New York] on Broadway, but the show closed just before that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what year is this?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-nine [1979].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I did 'Today's Black Woman.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that's '81 [1981]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 1980 and 1981, yeah.
Speaker 1: How did that project go?  This is completely different.
Speaker 2: A talk show, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a talk show.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened was my manager, Charles Huggins, brought this project to me.  And he suggested, he talked me into it.  I really didn't want to do it, because I was still into that, "Oh, I'm a singer, I'm not a talk show hostess."  He said, "This will be good for your career."  And he was right.  And had I known the success of talk shows prior to that, I think I would have worked harder at trying to keep it going.  This is just before Oprah [Winfrey].  And I did it, and all I got to say is that doing a talk show is very hard work.  It's, you have to be totally committed.  Its twenty-four hours, other than having to sleep.  Because you got to do a lot of homework, you know.  It's like a constant thing.  And the hours are long, because you know when you do a talk show, you do several shows in one day.  So, you got to, you know, have that energy thing going, where you know how to keep it alive, keep it going.  But it was the most educational experience I've ever had.  Because in doing that, in studying and doing research and reading someone's book or reading somebody's background, you learned a lot more about people and what's going on, the subject matters that came up that we did.  It was sort of like an education, it was a great education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Who were some of the guests?
Speaker 2: We had all kinds of different guests.  Shirley Chisholm, Don King, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Natalie Cole, the people who run Essence magazine--I forgot their names.
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor?
Speaker 2: Susan Taylor, and then--
Speaker 1: And [HistoryMaker] Marcia Ann Gillespie was there.
Speaker 2: --that guy, [HistoryMaker] Earl [G.] Graves [Sr.]--
Speaker 1: Earl Graves of Black Enterprise?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  [HistoryMaker] Vernon [E.] Jordan [Jr.], [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson.
Speaker 1: Can you--is there any one show that's more memorable than the rest, or one that just kind of, where there's a good story?
Speaker 2: You know, it's funny because some of them were boring, you know, and then some weren't.  We did a show on voodoo, and that was interesting, you know, because I learned a lot.  I learned that voodoo wasn't all bad, you know.  And it has a, it's very, it's very much entwined with Catholicism and religious relics, like religious saints.  And I even--I don't know if they were pulling my leg, but there's a Saint Freda [Erzulie Freda].
Speaker 1: I think there is, yeah.
Speaker 2: And I was surprised at that.  And I enjoyed--oh, I enjoyed Don King, because he has sort of a colorful, interesting background to say the least, and he's a colorful, interesting person.  (Laughter) Jesse Jackson, I enjoyed interviewing him, and Shirley Chisholm.  And Teddy Pendergrass, this was before the accident.  It was a, it was a, like I said, it was a very educational experience.
Story_ID: 261343
Speaker 1: I don't want to jump ahead.  But is it time to talk about the Knights of Malta [Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem of Rhodes and of Malta]?
Speaker 2: Okay.  That's '73 [197], '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, I have to go back to that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you got to go back.  Oh, yeah, we forgot about that.
Speaker 1: You're not just a regular talk show host, you're a dame.
Speaker 2: Oh, then I became--this organization, Knights of Malta.  What happened was, I met, I have some friends--I had some friends in New York [New York], and they were associated with Prince [Robert] von Brancovan and Princess von Brancovan [Dr. Audrey Kargere] of Romania.  And they headed this organization, the Knights of Malta and the Sovereign Military and Hospital Order of St. John of Jerusalem.  And they just, because of our social--you know, like me being involved socially with them, they asked me if--they said they would like to have me dubbed a dame.  They felt that that was a befitting honor for me, and would I like to do it, would I accept the honor?  And I said, "Well, why me, you know?"  Anyway I accepted it, and I was dubbed a Dame of the Knights of Malta.
Speaker 1: Okay this, the dubbing, it was covered by Jet magazine, on their cover.
Speaker 2: It was covered by Jet.
Speaker 1: And you had a bigger story than Pearl Bailey in that issue.
Speaker 2: That's right.  (Laughter) Forgive me, Pearl.
Speaker 1: Your picture was on the cover in full color.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And so this was, I mean, I didn't know what to make of it when I saw it.  I know some people were like, "Dame of Malta, what does that mean?"
Speaker 2: Well, it was just, you know, it was--like they say, when I look back, it was something that I just got involved with, just stumbled into; it just happened.  You know, it's like they say, well, sometimes if you stumble into a nest of bees, you get stung.  (Laughter) So, I stumbled into some, you know, royalty, and they liked me.  Also I was, my sponsor was Prince [Hassan] Durrani of Afghanistan at the time; he's Afghanistanian [ph.].
Speaker 1: That's a couple of governments ago for Afghanistan, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh, yeah.  Yeah, um-hm.
Story_ID: 261344
Speaker 1: I don't want us to leave anything out, so let me know, now if we're leaving something out. 'Cause you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Well, just like you, I forget stuff, too.  It's like, oh, I forgot to say that.
Speaker 1: In 1981, after 1981, that's the talk show ['Today's Black Woman'].
Speaker 2: Eighty-one [1981].
Speaker 1: Now, how did the talk show end?  What was the--
Speaker 2: It just, you know, it just sort of faded out.  Like, we were doing pretty good.  It was Plough Chemicals [Plough Chemical Company] located in Memphis [Tennessee], they were the sponsors.  And they, it sort of--one day, you know, they said, well, they were dropping the show.  You know, we hear about that all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was this show a network, or it was syndicated?
Speaker 2: It was affiliated, it was network--it was network affiliated and syndicated.
Speaker 1: That was common in those days for talk shows, I know.  Phil Donahue's show ['The Phil Donahue Show'] was even like that in those days.  That was before he got, I think, hooked up on a major network.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I used to watch Phil Donahue a lot.  I liked his show until Oprah came along, and she wiped everybody out.
Speaker 1: She did it.
Story_ID: 261345
Speaker 1: So, what did you do after the talk show ['Today's Black Woman']? I mean you continued to perform, of course?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I was still performing.  So, I went back to performing as usual.  And then I did, that's when I got booked to do Duke Ellington's 'Sophisticated Ladies' in Las Vegas [Nevada] at the Desert Inn.  And that was like a long run, so I was there for, it was like an eight month run.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now that was, 'Sophisticated Ladies' was really big in those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a big, it was a hit show.
Speaker 1: Somebody's still doing it now someplace, I'm sure.
Speaker 2: Somewhere, yeah.  But on Broadway, that was with Gregory, the late Gregory Hines, and [HistoryMaker] Judith Jamison, and the late Phyllis Hyman.
Speaker 1: That was 1982?
Speaker 2: This was, when I did it, it was, well, it started in '82 [1982] and then we finished it in '83 [1983].
Speaker 1: Now, did you do other musicals after this?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I did 'Sophisticated Ladies' then. And then I did another, I did a whole road tour across the country in '85 [1985], another whole tour.
Speaker 1: Was that 'Sophisticated Ladies'?
Speaker 2: Yes, 'Sophisticated Ladies'.  And then let's see, '85 [1985], '86 [1986], and then I did 'Ain't Misbehaving' ['Ain't Misbehavin''], and that was with [HistoryMaker] Della Reese[-Lett], Linda Hopkins, Ted Ross, and Lonnie McNeil.
Speaker 1: And when was that?
Speaker 2: That was in '83 [1983].  Yeah, that was in--or was it--wait a minute.  I think that was '82 [1982].  Wait a minute.  That was '82 [1982], just before I did 'Sophisticated Ladies.'
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, that was before?
Speaker 2: Wait, I'm trying to get this straight now.  It might have been '81 [1981].  It was '82 [1982], before I did 'Sophisticated Ladies,' yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was in the earlier part of '82 [1982].

Speaker 1: Are there any good stories from these shows that you can tell us (laughter)?
Speaker 2: I can't.  No, I don't want to tell you, because like--well, like what kind?  Silly stories?  Funny stories?
Speaker 1: I don't know, something that stands out.  I know there's always stories on the road, and when you travel.
Speaker 2: Well, I remember on the road when we were in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] staying at the Stouffer's Inn.  And we were at, what's the big theater-in-the round outside of Philadelphia?  Do you remember the name of it?
Speaker 1: The Spectrum [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: No.  For all you--anybody who's from Philadelphia, whatever the--do you remember the big theater-in-the round that's outside of Philadelphia?  I forget the name of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But anyway, we were staying at Stouffer's Inn.  And Linda Hopkins is known to be a good cook.  And she had a room, not a suite.  So she cooked a full meal in her room.  And she invited [HistoryMaker] Della [Reese-Lett] and her then boyfriend, Franklin [Lett], who is now her husband, and myself and my boyfriend at the time, to her room to have dinner.  And she cooked in the room, and the smell of food was all in the hallway.  She had two electric fry pans; she had a toaster oven; she had a cooler in her room.  And it's sort of like you think of the old days when you're struggling, and that's when you did stuff like that.  (Laughter) But you know, she did, she was still doing it.  But anybody that knows Linda, the great Linda Hopkins, she's one of our legendary jazz and blues singers.  And I thought that was funny.  And then she blew the fuse, the fuse was blown twice.  (Laughter) And, but we had a good time.  Those are some of the good times you remember, you know, that you don't just, things like that just don't happen all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then the time that Phyllis Hyman came to see the show with [HistoryMaker] Andre De Shields.  She came backstage after the show, and she had taken her shoes off.  And Della was like, "Look at you.  You're supposed to be a big Broadway star, walking around with no shoes on.  What's that all about?"  (Laughter) And then they had a few words back and forth, which I won't mention.  But stuff like that.
Story_ID: 261347
Speaker 1: Now, what other shows did you star in?
Speaker 2: After, okay, 'Ain't Misbehavin',' then I did the 'Blues in the Night.'  That was conceived and directed by Sheldon Epps.  I did that here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and we did it in Japan, and we did it for the Seattle Repertory Company [Seattle Repertory Theatre] in Seattle [Washington].
Speaker 1: What was he 'Blues in the Night'?
Speaker 2: It's a show, it was a musical about different blues, different artists, different songwriters, you know.  Of course, Blues in the Night comes from Harold Arlen, Harold Arlen, the great Harold Arlen.  And then we had songs by, there was a song by Alberta Hunter that I did called 'Rough and Ready Man.'  And then there was Bessie Smith, there was a Bessie Smith number.  The concept of the show is three women who are distinctly different.  One woman is the lady, they call her the lady on the road, the woman on the road, who was this blues singer who was big back in her day, but had seen better times.  But now her career is on the slide, and she's living in a cheap, rundown hotel, and she's still dreaming about the past.  The other woman is the woman of the world.  That was this woman who was like, who had lived high and mighty and had money, married many rich men and was very affluent, but now she's on harder times.  She's living in the same cheap hotel, and she's still pretending like she's all of that.  Then the third woman is a young, is like young and fresh, and hopeful for the future.  And she is looking for love and success and all that.  So, and then finally--there's only one male character.  And he's sort of like the skeptic, kind of like trying to control all three of these women and talking about all three of the women, and making comments.  And it was a wonderful show, it was a wonderful show.
Speaker 1: With full cast members?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and a six-piece band.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seemed like the mid-'80s [1980s] was a time of revival for a lot of black music from the '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s] and so forth.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: There were a lot of, you know, a couple of Bessie Smith shows (unclear).
Story_ID: 261348
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot to talk about my marriage.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I got married.  I got married, I became, I got married to Gregory Abbott December 1, 1976.  And--
Speaker 2: Okay.  Where did you meet?
Speaker 1: I met Gregory, well, actually the first time I met him was right here in the house.  And I didn't--but nothing happened, because I didn't realize--you know, it was like nothing happened then.  And he was with my friend, Sandra McPherson, and that's how we, how we met.  Then about six months or eight months later, I went to a party here in Hollywood [Los Angeles, California].  It was a party that was given by an actor named David Downing.  And he had a lot, you know, a lot of fellow actors, and his friends who had attended the party.  And I met Gregory at that party.  Let's say we, I realized I had met him before.  But then we really, that's when I really noticed him, was at the party, and we kind of like just hit it off.  And--
Speaker 2: Now, you were telling me earlier that he was a professor of English literature?
Speaker 1: He was working on his doctorate's degree at Stanford University [Stanford, California], and all he had to do was his dissertation.  But he had, he almost, he never really got his doctor's degree.  Because he never went--he didn't finish.  He decided to quit just at a point where he was just, he had just about accomplished all of that.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: He did, he had taught some classes.  He did teach some classes, yes, he did.  And we got married.  And we have a son, Gregory Abbott, Jr., who you met.  And my son is pursuing acting.  He's studying now, he's a very good actor.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He's about twenty--
Speaker 1: Twenty-seven.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And, well, you didn't, well, you didn't stay married, the marriage didn't last.
Speaker 1: It didn't last, no.
Speaker 2: He was a performer, too, right?
Speaker 1: No, he wasn't.  When we met, he wasn't in show business at all.  After we separated and he went back east to New York [New York], he started writing.  And then he got a deal with Columbia Records, Charles Koppelman.  And his first record came out, and he had a number one hit across the board, R&B and pop.
Speaker 2: What's the name of it?
Speaker 1: 'Shake You Down,' called 'Shake You Down.'
Speaker 2: I remember that, I can hear it now.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Yeah, it was a good record.  He was on all the TV shows and all the talk shows and everything.  And he won a lot of awards.  He did a good job.
Story_ID: 261349
Speaker 1: We're right in the middle of the '80s [1980s], I guess.  So, what have been some of the highlights of your career, since the mid-'80s [1980s], I guess?
Speaker 2: Since the mid-'80s [1980s], mid-'80s [1980s] to the '90s [1990s]?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Okay, after that, just, I guess working and--
Speaker 1: Well, I know you were recently in a show called 'Love and Payne.'
Speaker 2: Oh, that was, that was me and Darlene Love.  That was a cabaret, you know, a cabaret performance.
Speaker 1: It was favorably reviewed.
Speaker 2: Oh, God, we got great reviews, Stephen Holden of The New York Times.  That was at, we were in New York [New York] at Michael Feinstein's, at the Regency, at the [Loews] Regency Hotel [New York, New York].  And then we did it again, and we appeared here at the Cinegrill in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel [Los Angeles, California], and the same thing--we got great reviews again from Don Heckman.  And, let me see.  Basically, I've been, let me see, what other shows have I done?  Oh, I did 'Jelly's Last Jam.' That was in the early '90s [1990s].  I did the, I was in the first debut company, the world debut of 'Jelly's Last Jam' at the Mark Taper Forum Theatre [The Music Center, Los Angeles, California], playing the role of Gran Mimi.  And then I did the national tour of 'Jelly's Last Jam' with [HistoryMaker] Maurice Hines [Jr.] and Savion Glover.
Story_ID: 261350
Speaker 1: What is your opinion about today's singers?  Because when you were in--one of the reviews for 'Love and Payne' that I saw, they were comparing you and Ms. [Darlene] Love with some of the singers today that don't know how to breathe when they sing.  They were suggesting that a lot of the young people don't, they haven't really studied it to the point where they, they're not--they don't know--they don't know how to breathe as they sing.  I mean, so do you have any opinion about that?
Speaker 2: Basically, I would just have to say that they have to study, you know, get with a vocal coach.  See, I came from the old school, like I came from the school of like the Nancy Wilsons, you know.  I came up studying Ella Fitzgerald, studying Sarah Vaughn.  Eydie Gorme was another person I used to listen to, [HistoryMaker] Gloria Lynne.  Even some of my contemporaries like Thelma Houston, like, another great singer back from, you know, who came along at the same time I did.  You know, we all kind of like, we have dealt with good breath control.  You just have good breath control because you're a stylist, you know.  You know where to breathe, and how long to hold a note, and what kind of emotion to invoke into that.  So, I think nowadays what happens with these singers they're referring to today--they're manufactured, they're really manufactured.  They pick a singer now by how she looks, and how well she can shake her butt, you know.  And if she can carry a tune, and if she's pretty and got a nice long weave or some nice long pretty hair, and got a halfway decent voice, they might be able to get her to stay in tune, you know.  And as long as she--you know, nowadays it's--the day of the singer has been evaporated, it has evaporated.  Because I came up when singers stood still on the stage with a nice gown, you know, and whatever little jewelry you're going to have on, and with your hair nice.  And you sang, and people listened to your voice.  It wasn't about four or five dancers on each side, and you doing a production number.  That's a dancer, that's a dancer.  Singers stand up and sing.  Now, it's nothing wrong with moving around.  I'm not saying that you're supposed to just stand like this and sing.  But like nowadays, like a lot of these singers they're referring to, they're more like, they remind me of--if I were to go back years ago, like in my mind, and see these young girls the way they dance and sing now, I'd say, "Oh, they're shake dancers who sing."  (Laughter) Because all they're doing is like--and the thing is so heavy on sex.  It's so heavy on selling sex, bumping and grinding.  There was a time when you would never, you would only do that if you were like in a striptease club, you know.  It was sort of like, it's sort of, so unladylike.  And all the stuff--and then they've got the nerve to wonder why the rappers say hos and bitches.  I'm not surprised.
Speaker 1: You wonder which came first.  When you see popular culture, does the name come from the reality, or does the reality come from the name?  It's all wrong, but--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I think what it is, is that when they start--they've just gone wild.  They cross the line, they cross the line.  And they've got to pull it--somewhere they've got to start pulling it back.
Story_ID: 261351
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite singer?
Speaker 2: I like Thelma Houston.  The reason why I say--there's a lot of other singers I love.  I just left Atlanta [Georgia] for the Trumpet Awards, and I was with Nancy Wilson, who received a Lifetime Achievement Award.  And to me, Nancy is like one of our greatest jazz/pop singers.  She's an icon, you know, and she's been there a long time.  She's been doing it a long time, and she's one of the best stylists, one of the best stylists I've ever come across.  And she's held that position for a long--for decades.  But I also like Thelma Houston, and I'll tell you why.  There's an album that Thelma made called 'Sunshower,' and she made it back in the '60s [1960s], it was 1968 [sic. 1969].  And I got that album from '68 [1968] and I have, like, loved to play that.  To this day, I can play that album.  I take that CD--I found the CD, put in it my car, and it's like all my troubles and worries go away.  And she's done many, many albums since then, but I'm sorry to say, sorry Thelma, but I still like 'Sunshower.'  (Laughter) That's like it makes me mad when somebody says, oh, I just love 'Band of Gold.'  And I say, "Yeah, but I've done fourteen other albums."  (Laughter) But hey, that's the way it goes.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have a favorite song that you sing?
Speaker 2: A favorite song?  There's a song called 'Here's to Life' and that's only--well, like the last ten years I've liked that song.  It's a ballad, and I like 'Here's to Life' because it's so profound.  That's a song I like.  But I like--but there's so many--there's a lot of songs I like.  'Here's to Life' was written by Artie Butler and Phyllis Molinary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, you can mention some more.  I mean, it doesn't have to be one.
Speaker 2: Oh, my God, I don't know.
Speaker 1: A song that you're really excited about when you get on stage, you know, that you get a special feeling for.
Speaker 2: Oh, 'Lush Life,' I like that.  There's so many great, there are a lot of good songs.  I like 'em all.
Story_ID: 261352
Speaker 1: --We always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Get away from violence, to eradicate violence and poverty, which is all like political, very political.  And I guess to stop feeling like crabs in a barrel, they have to pull one down in order to get on top, you know, to get on top of another in order to climb--to get on top of everybody else.  But then that's just, I guess that's also natural human thing, the desire to succeed.  The African American community, the best, I think the strongest thing we have is the black church.  And not to say that they should--I mean some people might say well they use that as a crutch, or it's like everybody's like--of course we know that.  I've been raised, I was raised in the church.  It's sort of like the majority of us came up like that, not all of us, but the majority of us.  Like, we all can identify with that.  But sometimes you have to look--sometimes it might be that that may be one of our strongest points.  And also, education.  I mean we have like the president of American Express, Ken Chenault.  What's that guy, what's his name?  Richard Perkins [sic. HistoryMaker Richard Parsons] of Time Warner [Inc., New York, New York].  Did I get that name right?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: What is it?
Speaker 1: I have to think of it.
Speaker 2: Okay, Pinkins [ph.]?  Perkins?
Speaker 1: Well, we'll get it.
Speaker 2: Okay, you know who I'm talking about.  We can, I mean, you can excel, you can make it.  And the drugs, I guess that's something.  That's a tough call, that's a tough nut, that's kind of hard.  And the reason why drugs prevail is because people make money and that's how, and they feel that's the only way to get out of the ghetto, or to make it.  And we constantly we see, you know, like on TV and on radio and billboards--like cars, flashy cars, jewelry--the rappers with their bling-bling, and very ostentatious ways, not even in good taste really.  You know, just diamonds for the sake of diamonds.  Like, "Look how rich I am."  People who are really, really, really wealthy, some people, a lot of people I know, they don't wear their wealth on their body.  And all that does is cause more resentment.  And these young people, it gets them to thinking, "Well, what can I do to get that?"  You know.
Story_ID: 261353
Speaker 1: There are a lot of biographies of black entertainers that have been written--some of the ones--shows like 'Ain't Misbehavin'' and other shows.  There's a show about an entertainer, and it's a common script now, especially in a lot of communities. There's a big story, a biography, of a black entertainer that comes out of a poor background and becomes a big hit.  They're riding high and getting drugs and alcohol, and then they go down to the bottom, you know.  I mean it's a script, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know.
Speaker 1: And we can put a number of personalities in there, and it fits the same script.  How have you avoided those kinds of pitfalls, you know?
Speaker 2: I like me.  I like me, and I want to feel good.  Now, some people say, "Well, drugs make you feel good, and alcohol makes you feel good."  I say, "Yeah, but hey, if it's not helping you, and it's not making you healthy, why do it?  If it's not helping your voice, why do it?"  I don't understand--I know what you mean.  Like this person, I don't want to mention her name, but you know who I'm talking about.  She rose so high, and had such a fabulous career, and now she's like--you know, everybody knows.  And that hurts me, it just downright hurts me, you know.  Why rise so high to just fall, like fall into the gutter?  Why?  It doesn't make any sense; it doesn't make any sense at all.  It's almost like, okay, so somebody put a curse on you?  (Laughter) Do you believe in that?  Is there some kind of problem?  I don't know, I really don't know, I don't know.  And I'm not saying I'm perfect.  You know, I'm not into drugs.  There were, I mean back when I was in my twenties I did a little bit of stuff here and there, you know, like marijuana.  You know, it was like, it was just for fun.  But hey, those days are gone, I don't do that.  Also, before we finish, I'm working on a project now that is going to be going into the theaters in the future, probably in the fall of this year.  Last year, December of 2004, I did a play, a musical called 'Ella Fitzgerald--[The] First Lady of Song' at the Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and I got great reviews.  And I'm going to be doing it again, and we're putting it into theaters this year, towards the end of the year with the possibly of probably, hopefully, going to Broadway.  And of course, I play Ella [Fitzgerald].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So this is in the works right now?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: It's been done already.  We ran for three weeks, and I got good reviews.  And a company called Columbia Artists [Management Inc.] is putting it together, they're doing it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Out of New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  I had a question I was--oh, when you look back on everything you've done at this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I don't want to talk about it.  (Laughter) What can I say?  There's some things I've said or done that I wish I could go back and do it again.  But, hey, that's it.

Speaker 1: We talked about your family earlier.  We didn't know your father was a Golden Gloves boxing champion, right?
Speaker 2: Right.  He was a Golden Glove, he had a, he was a Golden Glove boxing champion.
Speaker 1: And did your--
Speaker 2: Lightweight, lightweight.
Speaker 1: Now, how did your--your parents, are they still alive?
Speaker 2: No, they're all dead.  My mother [Charsilee Hickman Farley] passed away in 1977.  My real father [Frederick Payne], he passed away.  My stepfather just passed away in 2001.
Speaker 1: He sounds like he was very supportive of you.
Speaker 2: Oh, he was extremely--he was the father--he basically was the father that kind of took care of us, was our father, although our real father was there, too.  But it was more or less--you know.
Speaker 1: And that's Mr. Farley, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Mr. Farley, Sam Farley.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a wonderful father, he was a good father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, how did they feel about your career and how it worked out?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm so glad that my mother was able to see my success.  And I was able to take her, I took her on one of the trips to Europe when I was touring, I took her with me.  And she died from breast cancer.  And I got a chance to bring her to Japan at the height of my success.  And she was able to go Japan, so I feel good that she was able to see all that.  And when I was dubbed the Dame [of Malta] she was there too, in New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I hear your father put his life story on tape?
Speaker 2: That's what my Aunt Mary Julia [ph.] just told me.  I didn't even know that.  I didn't even know it.
Speaker 1: And your sister, [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne], has become a noted singer.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Oh, Scherrie is with The Supremes.  She started out with Invictus [Records], too, a group called The Glass House.
Speaker 1: Right, I remember.
Speaker 2: And they had, they had a hit called 'Crumbs Off the Table' which she wrote.  And then she was asked to join The Supremes in '74 [1974].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you and your son [Gregory Abbott, Jr.] live together here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my son, (background noise) my son lives with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  We always ask this question, too.  At this stage in your career--and you're still very young in terms of being able to--you know, you've got a lot more time to perform and do things.  What would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: My latest what?
Speaker 1: Your legacy.
Speaker 2: Oh, my legacy.  You mean how people think of me?
Speaker 1: Well, what do you think has been the most important things that you left behind?
Speaker 2: My persona, who I was and what I was like.  A touch of class.  A person with dignity.
Story_ID: 261356
Speaker 1: Now, I didn't ask you, I meant to ask you this earlier.  But do you have any favorite charitable causes or projects in the community that you're working on?
Speaker 2: Minority AIDS [Initiative].
Speaker 1: AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome] in the minority community?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Minority AIDS.  Whenever I get a chance, like the charitable thing, they'll say "Do you have a favorite charity you want to donate to?"  I usually give, they're the ones I give it to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything we haven't asked you that you think we ought to address--
Speaker 2: There's always something you forget about, huh?
Speaker 1: Before we ask the last question?
Speaker 2: Anything you haven't asked me?  I can't, right now I can't think, I can't think of anything other than--probably after you leave, I will (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's what everybody (unclear).
Speaker 2: I'll be like, "Oh, I forgot (laughter)."
Story_ID: 261357
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.  I don't know if you ever thought about this before, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: As a good singer, a person who cared about her fellow man.  I guess that's about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Not too much, huh (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Thank you so much for spending the time with us.
Speaker 2: Okay, thank you, Larry [Crowe].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 261358
Speaker 1: (Background noise) One forgotten question.  How do you stay so fit?  You're known for being fit.
Speaker 2: Well, I've always been sort of athletic in a way.  I started ballet when I was eleven.  And then when I got into my later teens, I studied modern dancing and modern jazz.  And then when I got into my, approached my thirties, I started with yoga.  And I've been doing hatha yoga with Bikram Choudhury since 1973.  I do yoga, and also the last five years I started to go, I started going to the gym and working out with a trainer.  So, that's what I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You seem to have a lot of dietary supplements.
Speaker 2: Yes, I have a lot of supplements I take, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: Do you watch what you eat?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah, I like to eat good food.  I like to eat good, you know.  I love food, I like to eat, yeah.  And I take vitamins and minerals and herbs, and stuff like that.  You know, as we age, things start happening, so you have to counteract, you have to kind of like give nature a little help.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.

Speaker 1: That picture is a photo that was taken in Detroit, Michigan.  And the year was, I guess, let's say approximately about 1971.  That's a picture of my mother in the center, Charsilee [Hickman] Farley, and on the left is my sister, [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne].  And of course that's me on the right in the purple.  And there's a photo in the background.  That's my cousin, that's my cousin Judy [ph.].  And she's on the Payne side, her name is Judy Pierce [ph.] now.  But she was Judy Johnson [ph.], and now she's Judy Pierce.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's great.
Speaker 1: And I think that was after a performance at, I was with Al Green at the time, I think at the Fisher Theatre [Detroit, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Is that about 1971?
Speaker 1: About 1971.
Speaker 2: Okay, this one?
Speaker 1: And that's a photo of my mother, that's my mom, Charsilee.  And that was taken in Detroit at the Michigan State Fair.  And it was sort of like, one of the trailers is back there.  Because I had been performing with Bob Hope, and she was back there officiating.
Speaker 2: All right, next.
Speaker 1: That lady is, her name is Ursula Walker.  That was her high school graduation photo.  And Ursula was a person that, back when I was in my early teens in Detroit, Ursula was the premier female teenage vocalist of Detroit, and I always admired her.  And we wound up, we wound up singing together in a group on the radio for station WJR [Detroit, Michigan].  And it was a show called Don Large's 'Make Way for Youth.'  And that was the only time, the first and only time I was ever in a group.  It was a trio called the Three Debs.  It was me, Ursula Walker, and Carmen Mathis.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture, like an ad, for a bar in Detroit.  It was located on 12th Street between Calvert [Avenue] and Collingwood [Street], called the Collingwood Bar.  And that was when it was first, when they first bought it.  My parents bought the Collingwood Bar back in the '50s [1950s].  And on the left is my stepfather, Sam Farley.  And of course, that's my mom on the right.
Speaker 2: What's her name again?
Speaker 1: Charsilee Farley and Sam Farley, my parents.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my mother, Charsilee Farley.  At the time, she was Charsilee--when that picture was taken, she was, I think, I don't even know if I was born yet.  But she was, her maiden name was Hickman, so she was Charsilee Hickman.  And then she married Fred Payne and became Charsilee Payne.  Then she divorced Fred Payne and became Charsilee Hickman.
Speaker 2: Okay, the next one.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of my mother and two friends.  She was eighteen years old when that was taken.  And that was taken in Detroit, the ghettos of Detroit.
Speaker 2: That looks like it might be Hastings Street.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't think it was Hastings.  It might have been St. Antoine [Street], or Brush [Street], or something like that, not too far from Hastings.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a picture of, first of all, on the far right is the great Joe Louis.  And next to him is a lady by the name of Kitty Pink [ph.], who was a dancer.  And next to her is me, [HistoryMaker] Freda Payne.  And next to me, standing is Leonard Reed.  Next to Leonard Reed is Jack Cione, who was the owner of the [Forbidden City] Nightclub [Honolulu, Hawaii].  And the lady who he's got his arm around, I don't know who she is, I forget who she is.  I don't remember who she is--maybe one of the people who worked in the nightclub.  And the man on the floor is probably the maitre d'.  And this was in Honolulu, Hawaii, back in 1961.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of my mother, Charsilee, and my grandmother, my maternal grandmother, Ada Lee Brack, standing on the porch of the apartment where they resided.  And it looks as though, from the looks of it, I was either--this was taken in the '40s [1940s], most definitely in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Do you need the spelling of the names.
Speaker 1: I think we got the names.  We've got the mother's name.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  She mentioned the grandmother.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ada Lee Brack.
Speaker 2: How do you spell Brack?
Speaker 1: B-R-A-C-K, Brack.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was a newspaper ad when I was appearing at the Elmwood Casino, which was a very, it was a first-class supper club located across the river in Windsor, Canada, Ontario, Canada.  And I was headlining there.  That was probably, it looks like in the, I think it was the late '90s [1990s] or early '70s [1970s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is a picture of my sister, Scherrie, and that is my son, Gregory, Gregory Abbott, Jr., on the floor when he was like, he looks like, I think he was about maybe a year old, or about--yeah, something around fifteen months old or something like that.  That was taken right here in the living room.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of myself and [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt.  That was taken in New York [New York] at the Rainbow Room on the 65th floor of Rockefeller City Plaza [Rockefeller Center, New York, New York].  And I was performing there at the time.  And I was doing an impersonation of Eartha Kitt, and she arrived and entered the room.  And then she came up on stage and proceeded to do the rest of it with me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is Frederick Ezekiel Payne.  That's my father when he was young, when he was a very young man.
Speaker 1: Great shot, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture that was taken of me in 1970, or was it '71 [1971]?  Anyway, it was in Paris, France.  And it was, it was at, I was in my suite at the Prince De Galles hotel on Rue George [V].  And I was just, I was just thrilled and elated to be in Paris and very happy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is my great-grandmother on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you want to give her name?
Speaker 2: Wait until Scherrie gets here, I forgot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother, I forgot.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me that was taken back in 1971, and it was a publicity shot.  But it got a lot of play, because that's when I started to get my sexy image.  That's when I got my, what do they call it?  You know, pin-up.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That was taken when I appeared on the Ted Mack amateur hour ['The Original Amateur Hour'] in New York City [New York, New York].  And I won second place, and Jet magazine chose to do an article on me.  That was my first article.  I had no idea they were going to be doing anything, they just picked me out.  And they did a whole article, they did about a three page article on me, and there it is, that's the inside.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.  The description for this one?
Speaker 2: For that?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Oh, that was me performing; that was me performing.  Those were shots that were taken of me when I was singing on the Ted Mack amateur hour in New York.
Speaker 1: Great, next.
Speaker 2: That was from Jet magazine.  That was my first pin-up calendar shot in Jet magazine.  I was sixteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my sister and I, Scherrie, and the great Count Basie.  My parents had taken us to, I think it was the cotillion, and they had one of the big shows and they hired the Count Basie Orchestra.  And so we got up and had a picture taken with Count Basie.
Speaker 1: Very good, next.
Speaker 2: That is a picture of my uncle.  He died when I was nine years old, and he was my mother's brother.  And it was because of--his name was Uncle Johnny [ph.], Johnny Hickman.  And it's because of my Uncle Johnny that I think I first, I first got the artistic bug of music.  Because he's the one that, he had all these records.  He had classical music--[Sergei] Rachmaninoff, [Pyotr Ilyich] Tchaikovsky, [Frederic] Chopin, [Johann Sebastian] Bach.  He had Duke Ellington albums, he had Lionel Hampton and Count Basie.  And I used to listen to it, I used to listen.  He used to play this music all the time, and I listened intently.  And when I had my first piano lessons, he used to like really make me practice.  And it's because of him I think I first really captured the essence of music.  I really, I think it sort of started training--the beginning of training my ears was through, was because of my Uncle Johnny.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me when I was about fifteen in Detroit singing in a nightclub (laughter).
Speaker 1: Very good.
Speaker 2: That is a picture that was taken, it was, actually--that's, you know, those cards, those little things they put on the tables in nightclubs?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: That was the, that was taken in the San Juan [Puerto Rico] Hilton [hotel].  And this was in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1970, when 'Band of Gold' first came out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is the cover of Jet that I did when I was dubbed a dame.  I was dubbed a Dame of Malta, and this was, the year was 1974.  And if you will, do you see that plaque back there?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: That's the scroll.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If you want me to, you can take that off and put that up there at some point.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is, again, the great Joe Louis and myself.  And I think the gentleman standing next to me is like the maitre d' of the nightclub in Honolulu, Hawaii where I worked with Joe Louis and Leonard Reed, when Joe Louis was doing standup comedy.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) She said he was a knockout.
Speaker 1: He was a knockout (laughter).
Story_ID: 261360
Speaker 1: Okay.  That picture was taken I think around 1966.  The man in the picture is [H.] LeBaron Taylor.  LeBaron, I knew LeBaron in Detroit [Michigan].  This is before he left Detroit to pursue bigger and better things.  LeBaron, he had sort of a big job at Sony [Music Entertainment, Inc.].
Speaker 2: He was a representative there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was one of the top black executives at Sony Records and Columbia.
Speaker 2: And Columbia.
Speaker 1: And Columbia Records, LeBaron Taylor.  He passed away a couple of years ago.  And of course that's my sister [HistoryMaker] Scherrie [Payne] sitting--I'm sitting on the far left with all that big hair (laughter).
Speaker 2: Is that Scherrie next to you?
Speaker 1: And Scherrie's sitting next to me.  The lady sitting next to LeBaron, I don't remember who she was, but that was his date.  I don't remember who it was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The year, it says August 14, 1958, Idlewild, Michigan.  Our family, we had a little cottage up there, and we would go up there every summer.  That's my stepfather, Sam Farley, on the left.  That's my sister Scherrie sitting next to him.  And that's me looking wicked, looking like I'm about twenty-one years old.  At the time I think I was only, it was 1958.  I was probably like fifteen.  And the lady sitting next to me is my Aunt Nonie Farley [ph.].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is a picture of my Uncle James [ph.].  That's James Payne, my father's brother.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: My father [Frederick Payne] had six brothers, I think.  No, no, I'm sorry, not six.  He had six sisters and three brothers.  You know, back then in the South, they had a lot of kids.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is one of the many centerfolds I did for Jet, shot by the late Isaac Sutton.  And that was in Chicago [Illinois] in the Lake Michigan yacht base.
Speaker 2: What year was this?  We can't find the year.
Speaker 1: That's a '60s [1960s] hairstyle, by the way.
Speaker 2: Here it is, '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: That is a Jet centerfold that I did in the '60s [1960s], 1963.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was, that was me in San Juan, Puerto Rico in 1970 performing on stage at a supper club, I think at the El San Juan Hotel [El San Juan Resort & Casino, San Juan, Puerto Rico], or one of the hotels in San Juan.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That is a paper ad from Madrid, Spain.  And I was performing at a night club in Madrid called the Pasapoga in 1965.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: That was an ad advertising a show coming up.  That was when I performed at the Apollo [Theater, New York, New York] with the great Billy Eckstine, the great [HistoryMaker] Quincy Jones' big band, and Nipsey Russell, who just recently passed away, and Coles and Atkins [Charles Coles and Charles "Cholly" Atkins].  And the year was, well, I'll tell you it was the early '60s [1960s], I know that.
Speaker 2: It's written here, I think.  Fifty--
Speaker 1: No, it was in the '60s [1960s].  Okay, it was like probably around '62 [1962] or '63 [1963], or something like that.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's just a shot of me, and that was taken in the '60s [1960s].  Exactly what year, I would say that was around, that could have been around '64 [1964].
Speaker 1: Okay, and this one?
Speaker 2: That was taken in San Juan, Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Hilton, the Caribe Hilton in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  And that was taken in 1968.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of my mom, Charsilee [Hickman Farley].  And this, obviously my mother was about sixteen or something, or seventeen, when this picture was taken, she was a teenager. That was before I was born.  And it looks just like my niece, Shoshana [ph.], Scherrie's daughter.  She looks just like, Shoshana looks like her grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, the next one.
Speaker 2: That is a picture I guess of all my mother and my mother's friends back then when they, when my mother was still married to Fred Payne.  And there they are together.  And if you can kind of focus on them together.
Speaker 1: Right here?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was definitely in the '40s [1940s].  That might have around, '43 [1943], '42 [1942], '43 [1943], or '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: That was a picture that was taken of me on the stage of the Baby Grand club in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Did you ever play at Smalls [Paradise, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: No, I never played at Smalls.  I played at the Baby Grand with Nipsey Russell, probably about a couple, two or three times.  That's taken from, that was a picture that was taken probably by, it was shot in Detroit.  And I think that picture may have been taken by a guy named Bailey [ph.], his last name was Bailey.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That is a picture, I think it's on the back--can you see it on the back?
Speaker 1: Yeah, '63 [1963].
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: July, 1963.
Speaker 2: July, 1963.  And I believe that might have been the Club Harlem.  That was the Club Harlem in Atlantic City [New Jersey], the Club Harlem in Atlantic City.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That picture was taken, that was in Detroit.  I was thirteen years old, and I had just won a talent contest on a TV show at WXYZ TV Channel 7 in Detroit.  And that TV show was called the Ed McKenzie dance hour ['Ed McKenzie's Saturday Night'].  And they always had a celebrity guest come and perform on that show as well, as part of the show format.  They had the talent contest, and then they had dancing, sort of like 'American Bandstand.'   And then they had a celebrity guest, whoever was in town, to come and do a number.  And Sammy Davis, Jr. was one of the guests at that time, and he took a photo with me.  And years later, I worked with him.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: That was my first professional photo, publicity photo, done by Popsy [ph.] in New York [New York].  And that was done, I was probably in my early twenties.
Speaker 1: The next one.
Speaker 2: That was another publicity photo that was done, and I forget the name of the photographer.  But that was a photo that was shot around 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a photo that was shot around--no, that was James [J.] Kriegsmann, so that was probably--I had moved up a notch.  Because James Kreigsmann, it was a little bit more expensive than Popsy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And all the performers had their pictures taken by James Kreigsmann by then.  He was the guy, he was the man.  And that was in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: This is a photo taken in Detroit of myself when I was sixteen years old.  I'm in the middle, and to the left of me is Ursula Walker, the girl I told you about.  And to the right of me is Carmen Mathis.  And we were, we had a singing group called, we were called The Three Debs.  And we performed in the choral group of Don Large's 'Make Way for Youth's' ['Make Way for Youth'] chorus on station WJR in the Fisher Building in Detroit.  And it came on every Saturday, and it was nationally syndicated.

Speaker 2: That is a picture that was taken when I was married to Gregory Abbott.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That is a picture of myself in high school [Central High School, Detroit, Michigan].  And I was part of a group, I was in a modern dance club.  And I don't exactly remember the names of those two ladies, the two girls that are with me.  But I have a feeling that Scherrie might remember them.  I know one of the, the girl that's on the floor, her name is Annette [ph.], but I forgot--Annette something.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a wedding picture, as you can see.  (Laughter) It was December 1, 1976 when I got married.  I got married in my uncle's basement, in his rec [recreation] room, in Chicago.  The late Bishop Elgin [E.] Little [II] married us.  And almost the whole staff from Ebony and Jet attended.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of me in Stockholm, Sweden, taken out of, it was in a magazine; they did a write-up on me.  And the year was 1965, Stockholm, Sweden.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: That's a real old one, 1964.  It's a magazine which is no longer in publication, called Bronze Thrills.  And they did a cover on me for Bronze Thrills.
Speaker 1: Okay, next.
Speaker 2: That is a program of one of my many piano recitals as a child.  And this was the first, this recital was the first time I ever sang in public before an audience.  And my piano teacher, whose name as you can see is Mrs. Ruth Johnson [ph.], was the lady who discovered I could sing.
Speaker 1: Next.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  The bottom picture is a picture of me, as you can see.  The year was probably 1961, I believe, '61 [1961] or '62 [1962].  And the top picture is a picture of Joe Louis, Pat Sidas [ph.], myself, Leonard Reed.  And the other lady, her name was Joanne [ph.], I don't remember her last name.
Speaker 2: Okay, next.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay.  That was in Las Vegas [Nevada].  The year was 1960, and I was, I was actually appearing there.  I was still, I was just seventeen, and I was working in the lounge of this hotel called the Sans Souci, which was located directly across the street from the Sands Hotel.  And Sammy Davis, Jr. was appearing at the Sands, and I was with my mentor.  His name was Matt Ferguson, he was a piano player.  And my mother was also with me at the time.  And I got a job at the Sans Souci Hotel performing.  And at the same time, Miriam Makeba was in the big room.
