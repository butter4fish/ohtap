Stephanie Rytilahti:     So, what was, what was the difference, then, when you came from San Francisco in&#8230;and then moved to Durham, North Carolina in 1982 in terms of the differences that you saw between those two communities?&#8221;  Mandy Carter:     Oh, yeah.  Well the first thing when I told, well first of all, when I decided to leave the Bay area it was probably because of the alcohol.  [Although Carter states that she brought her activism to her work at the bars, the overall culture of constant drinking was something she sought to escape.]  I was managing Maud&#8217;s.  I was managing Amelia&#8217;s for three years&#8212;every weekend in that bar.  And, and for me, you know, but, I mean, I also brought my activism to my work.  So, when we did Maud&#8217;s and Amelia&#8217;s, we would do things like the gay games.  We did that.  We had organized, I don&#8217;t know&#8230;whatever you would call, like in the bar scene.  I was like always organizing the talent, and, you know, we always had a contingent.  We had the first ever lesbian contingent in the San Francisco gay pride parade.  That was amazing. So, I got to bring my skills there.  When I decided to leave, when I started to telling people, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll take any job with the War Resisters League--that I wanted to get back involved east of the Mississippi.  Well, where was that:  Durham, North Carolina.  So, I said &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna be moving to Durham, North Carolina,&#8221; and they said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t they still lynching people out there, Mandy?&#8221;  It&#8217;s like this concept of the South, and I had never been to North Carolina.  So when I got here, I said, &#8220;Well, where&#8217;s the, where&#8217;s the&#8230;what is going on here?&#8221;  And someone said, &#8220;You need to start going to the YWCA.&#8221;  SR:
Right  MC:
And I said jokingly, &#8220;The Y.&#8221;  But I&#8217;ll tell you what--Triangle Lesbian Feminists, The Newsletter, the Ladyslipper.  You had so much with the lesbian culture here in Durham.  A lot to do with Duke.  But it was like, &#8220;Oh my God.  I&#8217;m still here.&#8221;  That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s unbelievable.  The scene then, I think it was like maybe one or two bars, but it wasn&#8217;t really around the bar anymore.  It was women&#8217;s dances, Ladyslipper used to have listening parties.  You always had some kind of a&#8230;we started doing our first ever, I think, gay.  We did our first ever official gay pride in 1986.  Because we said, &#8220;Why are we going to Atlanta?&#8221;    SR:
Yeah.    MC:
&#8220;Why are we going to Washington?  Why don&#8217;t we just create our own?&#8221;  So, we formed this thing called the Triangle Area Lesbian and Gays.   And things started to move around.   SR:
So, were there more out lesbians of color in Durham than in---.  MC:
Oh, no.  SR:
Than in San Francisco.  No?      MC:
No, the huge difference, I would say to you, when I moved to Durham and even is still.  I guess it&#8217;s not because people can&#8217;t be out.  I think it&#8217;s just a different way of how black lesbians socialize--the house parties.  It&#8217;s like, you know, they need to know someone who knows someone.  They go out to the bar but not a whole lot.  So, there&#8217;s a whole subculture, but I think it might be more of a Southern kind of thing here.  [In this instance, Carter is commenting on a regional difference between the South and the Bay Area.  In her estimation, people were more closeted in the South and sought private places to socialize rather than the visible bar communities she found in San Francisco.  She attributes this difference to &#8220;southern culture&#8221; which could include family ties, religion, and a more conservative political environment].  SR:
Uh, huh.    MC:
There are a lot of black lesbians.  Well now we have, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve talked to the women who started the Infinity Diamond Club?  SR:
No.  Who is that?  MC:
Oh, you should really, you should really meet them.  Priscilla Coleman and Annie Ross.  Um, and they are in&#8230;I think.  They have a web link.  You can Google them.  But these are two women who moved here to Durham.  God, a couple of years ago.  And they have added a wonderful feature of social, political, spiritual kind of element to what they do.  If you check out their Facebook page you&#8217;ll see what I mean.  And they, so, they&#8217;ve added, they&#8217;ve made it more possible because there really is not a bar to go to per se--.  SR:
When did they move here?  MC:
I want to say, like, three years ago.    SR:
Okay.  MC:
And I want to say they moved up from, I thought "15:17&#8221; down in Georgia?  Or, South Carolina?  I just remember distinctly meeting them when they moved to this area.  And so when they moved here they, they, they had this idea or vision of having for everyone, even though they&#8217;re two out black lesbians.  Their vision is inclusive.  No matter people of color, LGBT, ally, this and that.  And they do this great conference called &#8220;We Are One Conference.&#8221;  It&#8217;s gonna be coming up in April.  I think.  And they&#8217;ve actually got a space here, Stephanie, over here on the backside of, um&#8230;I&#8217;m tying to think.  Do you know where Northpoint is?  It&#8217;s&#8230;If you keep on going out Club Boulevard.  No, not Club.  Um, you know were Salisbury is? Do you know where--.  Okay.  SR:
No, I&#8217;ve only lived here&#8212;.  MC:
Okay.  SR:
About six months.    MC:
Oh.  SR:
I live in Raleigh.  MC:
Okay.  Well, anyway.    SR:
Right, so there&#8217;s this space.   MC:
There&#8217;s this wonderful space&#8212;.  SR:
Uh, huh.    MC:
Yeah.  And they now have it, they they person it.  [meaning they directly manage the club]  And they have wonderful &#8220;16:24&#8221;.  Because the only other thing here is still the Steel Blue which used to be out there on Highway 70, and now is right here, it is not far, not far from the downtown post office.  But I don&#8217;t do bars anymore.  You know.    SR:
Right.  MC:
So, so for a lot of people its dances.  It&#8217;s the Infinity Diamond Club for people and women of color.   I think, and then started doing black pride here.  Our second annual black pride will be coming up.  So the scene is not like, it&#8217;s not bar.  Its more of there&#8217;s a bar and then there&#8217;s all these other social things you get to do.  So, it&#8217;s just a different way.  And a huge growing Latina community now.  SR:
Uh, huh.  MC:
So you&#8217;ve got Latina lesbians, and black lesbians, and white lesbians, but--.  Yeah.  SR:
So, the Y.  So, when you got here in the early &#8216;80s the Y was really&#8212;.  MC:
That was it.    SR:
The thing.  So, what types of events, and and who was using that space?   MC:
Well, the Y itself, there was a group called Triangle Area Lesbian Feminists (TALF).  So, we always had once a month meetings there.  And the once a month meetings they were potlucks, meetings.  Pick a topic&#8212;.  SR:
Uh, huh.  MC:
Whatever it might be.  But we also had a thing called The Newsletter.  So The Newsletter, a physical space to meet in the Y, meetings, dances.  Ladyslipper would oftentimes do their concerts at the Y.  So the Y became sort of like this unofficial meeting place for this group.  Um, and who was there?  Mostly white lesbians, but, you know that&#8217;s mostly what the movement was.  Um, and, god, that went on for quite some time.  And then other things started to happen.  We got the, pride started happening.  Then the 1987 huge march on Washington for gay and lesbian rights.  We organized a huge contingent for that.  That got us up there.  Then it just seemed like our movement was no longer just lesbians in Durham.  Then it became more Triangle area, Raleigh, Chapel Hill.  Things started expanding.  Um&#8212;.  SR:
So, what connected people when you say, you know, then you went to the, the 1987 march.  What got people who were, you know, doing stuff on the local level---.  MC:
Yes&#8212;.  SR:
How did they get plugged into to know about that or to participate in that?  MC:
Well, you remember how I told you in San Francisco the lesbians were here and the gay men were here?  SR:
Right.  MC:
Coming to Durham was interesting because you also had, because&#8212;these are names that are important.  Joe Herzenberg was the first out gay man to run for and get a seat on Chapel Hill&#8217;s City Council.   SR:
Uh, huh.    MC:
So, when you had someone like a Joe Herzenberg who brought in that political element.  He ended up almost saying, kind of what Harvey Milk did, it was like, when Harvey first talked about running, everyone said, &#8220;Who cares?  What&#8217;s the point?  We&#8217;re having a great time.  So, you don&#8217;t have that many of us and don&#8217;t have a political impact.&#8221;  Joe felt the same way about gay and lesbians.  And he started a thing called Lesbian and Gay Democrats of North Carolina.  So, when you had someone like Joe that we all knew.  I knew Joanne Able, some key people.  We are more likely, Stephanie, to be the bridge builders in a way&#8212;.  SR:
Uh, huh.    MC:
That we didn&#8217;t, we weren&#8217;t just satisfied with dances and listening parties.  We thought, &#8220;well, isn&#8217;t there something a little bit bigger about who&#8217;s running on our city council?&#8221;  And then I think the thing that really broke it open when we decided to do our very first pride in &#8216;86.  I moved here in &#8217;82.  TALF was here for quite a few years.  When we decided to do our first pride in 1986 what made it go&#8212;exploded&#8212;was when one of the members&#8212;Mab Segrest&#8212;white lesbian&#8212;.  SR:
Yeah.  MC:
You know, she said to our current mayor, &#8220;Good golly, would you mind signing a proclamation for our first ever pride?&#8221;  He did and the city exploded.    SR:
Uh, huh.    MC:
Black conservative church, white conservative church got together and said we're going to recall the mayor because he&#8217;d dare sign this gay proclamation.  All of the sudden, the Durham paper--very conservative, very anti-gay--came out with something, like&#8230; They had an editorial that said, &#8220;Our mayor must be brain dead for even thinking about the possibility of signing this proclamation.&#8221;  Well, need I say more?  That just led to article or papers, and people setting up tables--to conservative churches to try to get signatures to recall the mayor.  You had right next to them, getting signatures to say don&#8217;t recall the mayor.   SR:
Uh, huh.    MC:
We made buttons--&#8220;No recall.&#8221;  They had articles calling Durham the San Francisco of the South--Sodom on the Eno.  It became a national story.  And we wanted to do was just have a march down Ninth Street.  Well, that became a huge deal.  And because of that organizing and all of us pulling together, we fortunately won the battle.  He did not get recalled, but then our ante just went way up.  It&#8217;s like, wait a minute, we to be more than just going to the Y.  SR:
Right.    MC:
Who&#8217;s running for city&#8212;yeah.  So, then it&#8212;.  SR:
So, that&#8217;s when it kind of---.  MC:
Snowballed.  That&#8217;s when it went&#8212;.  SR:
So, you kind of document the the thing that changed in San Francisco in about 1978 with the Milk and Moscone assassinations.  MC:
Right.    SR:
And here you&#8217;re placing it about a decade later.  That brought these confluences about?  MC:
Exactly.    SR:
So, you mentioned the conservative churches.  Were there churches that played a supportive role in the gay community?      MC:
You know there were a few.  I mean, when I think about &#8216;86 certainly you had a few that were very, very visible.  The Durham Friends Meeting House certainly was one.  Um, downtown, downtown Durham right across from the library, it&#8217;s The First Presbyterian Church&#8212;.  SR:
Uh, Huh.  MC:
Reverend Joe Harvard very, very supportive.  Um, yeah, there were a number of them.  I&#8217;d have to&#8230;. Those were kind of the key ones.  Unfortunately, no black church was, um, in a very visible way.  Now the other thing we need to add to this 1986 thing was the march.  One reason we went up in &#8217;87 because we had already organized for &#8217;86, and they said, &#8220;Oh, yeah, by the way there&#8217;s going to be a national march.&#8220;  So we just got done organizing, we&#8217;ll turn around and just do that, and I became the state coordinator for that.  So it was easy enough.  That was, that was unbelievable.
