Story_ID: 317054
Speaker 1: So I'm going to start with five sort of People magazine type questions before we get into your oral history.  And the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the first one is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I could lie and tell you gumbo and all that, right, and jambalaya (laughter), steak.  Like the average amer- steak and lobster, but that's not every day.  No, you know that, but I, I don't know.  I like good food.  I lived in France, you know.  I like, I like, like their food.
Speaker 1: So what are you going to say?  What's your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite what?
Speaker 1: Food.  Is it steak?
Speaker 2: Yeah, if I was, if, you know, I if I was invited out like and someone else is paying, you know, like, and it's one of those menus with no prices on it, I'll go to the steak.
Speaker 1: What about your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I guess spring.
Speaker 1: What about your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I remember when I was a kid, I used to say green.  But people say I'm partial to blue just looking at my work, right.  But I like--I'm into color.  I think about it a lot, you know, what color next to this color, 'cause sometimes you just don't, you just don't put--let's say, some artists, they've ask me, like, he's photographing me, and they say, "How did you get the photograph of," you know, because the picture was glowing, right?  Now just because you put every color in it, don't mean you have memorable color, see.  A lot of kids use color, right, you know, like that.  But this is what--and I'm sort of known for the color if you look at a lot of my work, you know.  It's like a science to me.  When I was in art school, the Art Institute of Chicago [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], I remember this teacher [Louis Ritman].  He's dead now, and he's famous now.  He was not American.  He was a Russian.  And he had known Claude Monet.  Monet died in 1926.  This man, when I'm an artist, it is in '40s [1940s], the late '40s [1940s].  He was in his sixties or seventies.  I didn't know, but he taught me a lesson.  I wasn't thinking about this sort of relate--art is sort of related to science, unless you're doing storytelling.  But, he said to some student next to me--no, he gave me a piece of paper.  He said, "Put them up to your eye.  Now, what color is it?"  I said, "White."  So he had this student to take another piece--but I still got that piece--across the piece.  He said, "Look over there.  What color?"  I said, "White."  He says, "Now look at them together."  I said, "Yeah, that one, that one's different than this one."  You see, 'cause that's the reflected colors, not the local color.  See, and that's what the Impressionists were.  You go to an Impressionist, one of the, one of the big things in their painting is luminosity of color.  They show this Monet in the long cathedral at different times of the day.  So some days it looks like all orange, even though it's got the proportion; in the morning all blue reflected, but not the--so even some of my figurative paintings, I was showing someone.  I said, "See this girl?  A local color is up here.  The other is reflected color."  So I got into that, you know.
Speaker 1: So which would you say is your favorite color?  Would you stick, stick with blue?
Speaker 2: No.  No one now, because I may do a color--no one can make a color that's, that's nonexistent.  But sometimes I almost think I'm doing that, right, like that.  And then it's like yeah, you know, creating real fast.  It's, it's, it's something like that but no one favorite.  I suppose pink would be that, but that could be--you got put all that--that could be sexual, see.  I remember I was going with this girl, I thought, well, you know.  And she's--and I'm not painting, and I'm looking.  She's in the bed with her legs open, and I had already painted a lot of pictures.  And all of sudden I realized it was exactly that pink that I'm looking at, 'cause that could vary in, in color too.  So, but I'm not thinking of sex, but you know, it, it was, you know.  And, and that's been said by--I think the Japanese use pink a lot for something sexual and whatnot, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 317055
Speaker 1: So what about your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Vacation?
Speaker 1: Destination (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I've never really had a vacation for thirty years or forty years or fifty years because when I go somewhere, it's always to work.  To give you an idea, Shawn [Shawn Wilson], I remember once I was invited to Mexico.  And this guy, he was (unclear) on my work, he said, "When you go to Mexico, I want you, you go meet this," his ex-girlfriend.  Her name was Jessie James [ph.].  She was Haitian.  And when I saw what she--well, what really happened when I showed up--I was supposed to show up with my current girlfriend.  I didn't.  Well, when her, her boyfriend saw that I would be there alone, you know, so they let me have the place alone.  The place was fabulous, I mean fabulous, right.  And the, and the next day they even had a maid, right, okay, and I couldn't work there.  It was too--no, I could live there but not work there.  I work--you see the way that studio look?  You know, so it wasn't possible.  It was free.  I ended up--I saw one of those books, five dollars a day or ten dollars a day (unclear) wrote those books in Mexico.  And went to go, going to the Yucatan part, very soft part, and this was Merida [Mexico], I think.  And then I saw this, you know, this article.  It says--how did they put it?  You know, right, poor man's budget.  I went to that place--something like that, only it's worded better than that. I went to that place.  It was perfect.  It was five dollars a day.  They had a cement floor.  I was alone, so I didn't have to worry about it.  They had a toilet with, with no door, but it was perfect.  I mean, I could do my thing, right, you know.  And I remember I don't know any Spanish.  I, I needed a--I couldn't put paper on the wall.  I may paint on the floor, but I had to put it look at it.  And I went to a lumberyard.  I didn't even know how to ask for that.  And then this guy, they kind said you know, and cut, they cut it.  They probably ripped me off, but even ripped off it was cheap (laughter), like four dollars or something.  And anyway, I still didn't know what to do because the, the, the people at the bureau, when she walked in in the beginning, I told them don't worry about it.  But then it got, what am I doing?  What is this American doing in that place?  And then I met some guy on the street one time I was taking timeout, and of course, he was a Mexican.  He might have been a police, a young, young, young guy, and he spoke English.  And so, when he looked at my work on his--I said, "Oh, would you tell him what I'm doing here," because you know, I didn't know how to tell him.  I tipped the guy.  You know, I was there for like five or six days.  I tipped the guy about twenty dollars.  So, I mean, he's not the owner.  But, and I remember that.  So, so, I need (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But he became your translator.
Speaker 2: So, I never go--right.  When I go to Paris [France], I can't go as a--well, I've never been as a tourist.  I lived there.  I always paint there.  And, and I, you know, I mean, we take side vacations.  You go down to the Riviera [French Riviera].  You go over to--the last time I was there, we went over to see my friend Sam Littleton [ph.] in Amsterdam [the Netherlands] and things like that.  But the moment I get there, I'm thinking I got to get back and do some work, right, you know.
Story_ID: 317056
Speaker 1: So what's your favorite phrase or saying?  Do you have one?
Speaker 2: My favorite what?
Speaker 1: Like a favorite phrase, or slogan, or saying?
Speaker 2: No, but they, one of them books on me--let's see.  Give me this, the flat one.  They quote--no, the other one. I'm sorry, the hardcover.  Somebody quoted me, if I can find it.  (Pause) Martinique, and this one's good here, including work and clips of Martinique, Taos [New Mexico], Britannique [Hotel Britannique, Paris, France], (unclear), Morocco, Sicily [Italy], and all those I did work.  What I, what I am fortunate is I don't have a job, a job, job, right.  You--this was like it would have been in the 19th century, like if you'd interviewed Van Gogh [Vincent van Gogh], but not--that's a giant but even less a giant.  People didn't--artists didn't, didn't go, I mean, it has happened and I know Rousseau [Henri Rousseau], they called it (unclear), he work, worked as customs.  But in general, I mean, they might have starved, but they didn't work, you know, nor did they necessarily teach, which some of them did.  So, all those where I got here, I mean, they got where I have--in fact, my wife did it for you--these jobs like visiting artists.  But a visiting artist, you don't apply for; they ask you.  There's nothing to really say about it, right.  It doesn't matter.  And I've, I've seen one when I was down at the Louisiana State University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana], I heard the guy was a dig on me.  They said well, they had a certain program called the visiting artist program.  But some of them turned, turned out to be a disappointment, 'cause they act like they prima donnas.  They don't have to stay.  They don't have to worry about anything.  And I heard one guy say, "Well, anyway, what harm can they do?  They're only here two, two months or so," right, like that, looking over at me, 'cause I'm lazy.  But, so, that's the other thing, yeah.  And if you were to ask me, yeah--oh, yeah, this, this is supposed to be, yeah.  "I think every artist wants to create something beautiful in the world."  I do.  "But I'll never be satisfied with what I've done."  That's because I'm striving for perfection.  And I got--if they got other statements, one I like better in here.  And this is--I got several tapes.  People interviewed me.  A big crew come from Louisiana.  At primetime they did it.  And this woman here--we don't have time for all that, but she asked me--she's naive, but she said what--like you, she asked a question: "What are you striving for?"  I said, "Something, but I'll never--but I, I'm not satisfied."  She said, "You're not satisfied?"  And then she found out my, my ego.  I said, "No, look, I like, you know, me better than everybody else, but I'm not satisfied with my own work, right.  I'm always striving.  That's why I change."  But I--she might have think, well, I felt all these giants, and I don't care about Warhol [Andy Warhol] or any of those--I think they're good artists.  But I mean--I'm just looking for this statement.  They got it written in, in another place though.  I'll get it to you.  (Pause) It's--so go on, Shawn [Shawn Wilson], say something.  I'll try to be intelligent (unclear).
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll come back to it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Let me look--
Speaker 1: We'll come back to it.
Speaker 2: --for this (unclear).
Speaker 1: I did read one of the statements, one of the--a quote on you where you talked about--it was something in reference to abstract artists in a sort of racial. I can't remember the quote exactly, but it was, it was very--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --well said.
Speaker 2: All right, I'll get--we'll get around to that, I guess.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we have time.  We'll find it.  Well, we'll get into the, sort of the, the, the origins of, of your life.
Story_ID: 317057
Speaker 1: I was actually looking for something that--is there something, not necessarily that you've said in the past, but something that sticks with you often, something that, you know, something that maybe a theme or a phrase that runs through your head on a, a frequent basis, something that travels with you when you're working.  Is there something that sticks with you?
Speaker 2: I understand your asking that.  And you know, my friend Gentry [Herbert Gentry] used to say--wait.  How did he put that?  A painter paints, a fighter fights, but, and a writer writes.  I'm not a writer, right.  I mean, I, I'm into reading good literature and whatnot, but I know those kind of genes are not in me, right.  It's very hard for me to write a letter.  Like, I'll go over and over with it, right, you know.  And some friend, I got a friend in, in England.  And he's the type could start the typewriter at the top and go to the bottom, pull it out, and put it in an envelope.  And he's a great writer, right.  I just want to see if I got some--well, can I get up?
Speaker 1: Oh no, no, that's okay.
Speaker 2: Oh no, no.
Speaker 1: We're just going to keep going, because I--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: --I have a structure I'm gonna follow.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay, all right.
Story_ID: 317058
Speaker 1: So, we're gonna start with: you were born in 19--
Speaker 2: Twenty-six [1926].
Speaker 1: --twenty-six [1926].  And your father [Edward Clark, Sr.] you said was a gambler, and your mother was a seamstress.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was amidst--not, not (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So let's talk about--
Speaker 2: --really.
Speaker 1: --your mother first.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --if you can just tell me your mother's name and spell it out for me.
Speaker 2: Merion, M-E-R-I-O-N, Hutchinson [Merion Hutchinson Clark] was the name, you know.
Speaker 1: What would your--what would--do you remember when your mother was born, her date of birth?
Speaker 2: She was ashamed of--you know what, this, this is an interesting thing.  My father was born 1906.  He's younger than her.  Now let's say--and this gonna happen later on in this entry.  What happens when you're a young woman, and everybody else is born nineteen-something, but you're born eighteen-something, right.  She just said, "I'm old enough to know better," and whatnot, we know.  But she was older.  We think she was born eight, eight, 1895 or something like that.  But she was, she was a devout Catholic, that type of person, you know, and--
Speaker 1: Where was she born?
Speaker 2: I think in Covington, Louisiana.  (Unclear) call that Lake, near Lake Pontchartrain.  We used to, when I was a kid, we'd take a boat--for now they have the causeway, and it takes the ferry across to New Orleans [Louisiana], yeah, yeah.  And I started school.  Then we moved to--no.  Then we moved to New Orleans with her sister.  We really never had our place, right.  And all of a sudden, my father said, "Let's go to Baton Rouge [Louisiana]."  That's where his aunt, the Clark lady who took him when he was like sixteen, you know, and she raised him.  And I remember when I saw that place in Baton Rouge.  I said we're not rich anymore.  We never were rich, right, you know.  I mean, you know, in the shotgun house the chickens were running through the house, had an outhouse.  And, but you know, and we started school there, yeah.
Speaker 1: So did your mother grow up in Louisiana as well?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: What do you know about her?  What stories did she share with you about her life as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, her father [Frank Hutchinson] had six kids, I mean, and a family, I think.  And she was--when her mother died suddenly, and she just kind of thought that she'd better get out of Louisiana, right.  People were dying.  And then she said they died in September.  She hated--so she eventually died in September herself.  So, she left, you know.  And, and her brothers and sisters, they sort of left and whatnot.  But I think she took a--she left for the up north a little bit.  She went to Detroit [Michigan] to wash dishes.  Now, she didn't have--education was limited to her.  But that's because she and people like her, they were, they, they would say they're Creoles, okay; nothing wrong with that.  Well, the white community, when she was a little girl, would look the other way if you were light enough and just look the other way.  Then, I, I think around nineteen--the turn of the century, they clamped down on all of that, right, and said you know, you, you're black.  You gotta go to black.  Well, they wouldn't go.  You know, they, they wouldn't go.  And then, and I remember what--I used to see those, and some of them would be beautiful, right, you know.  But we gotta be careful saying what's beautiful.  Like, in Martinique, they thought--they'd say cafe au lait girls, you know, it's parts of the Caribbean.  Well, that's a--what about the jet black beautiful girls, right?  They done forgot that too, see.  But anyway, they were beautiful.  And I remember what would happen.  They would never--I'd see them.  I'm a little boy.  And they never said much, because they know if they open their mouth, you'd find out they're not educated.  And all the doctors and the professional guys, especially the brothers with dark skin, they, they will, they'll marry them, right, and did marry them, right, you know, like that.  So, so she, she, she was the, you know, into that type of thing.
Story_ID: 317059
Speaker 1: And I used to say myself, "Wait a moment.  We're in Chicago [Illinois] now.  We're in a black neighborhood.  You never tell me about the African blood, right."  And one time in the '40s [1940s], in 1947, we went to Los Angeles [California].  Her brother was there, her oldest brother.  So I hadn't heard anything, just, just curious, talked to him.  So I jumped off the train before it took off to Chicago.  I said, "Could you tell me some things, you know, about her background," you know?  I, I meant that.  He said, "We were descendants from Napoleon and Mrs. Roosevelt."  I said, "Oh, shit, I'm sorry I asked."  Now, Napoleon never reached New Orleans [Louisiana].  There is in, in the French Quarter, there is a, a Napoleon cafe [Napoleon House, New Orleans, Louisiana].  He didn't reach there, and I know his penis couldn't reach across those waters, right (laughter).  So, I found out nothing, even now, nothing.  But I'm, I'm obviously--you saw my great-grandmother.  And I had some painters painting me once in Paris [France].  And a lot of times they, they, they little--they get hypnotized if you're away from a lot of people.  I look a little, back then, a little like an Arab.  When I moved there I looked a little like the Puerto Ricans.  It wasn't exactly the top thing to look like.  But these guys were painting me, and they were both portrait painters.  And all of a sudden, one day they were excited.  They said you--they're looking at their painting, "You, you, you, you have light blood, right?"  You know, they could see, see that, right, like that, you know.  That's Paris.  Now if that had been Whistler [James Abbott McNeill Whistler], who hated black people, they--he would have knocked me out of--I mean he would've pushed me out of his studio, right, you know.  I didn't know Whistler.  But anyway, so that's all that kind of Creole stuff.
Speaker 2: So your mother [Merion Hutchinson Clark] was Creole?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: What can you tell me about your mother's father?  Do you know anything about your mother's father?
Speaker 1: Carpenter.
Speaker 2: What was his name?
Speaker 1: It's Frank Hutchinson.  He committed suicide, you know, later on.  I don't know.  That gets all into the--we never know then why he didn't--he, he had--when his wife died, my grandmother, he's free to marry.  He's a Catholic; you can marry.  I don't know if he believed in it.  But he didn't.  And so, they had something about, and, and my mother and them would not accept this woman who he was living with.  But I'll never know why he didn't marry her.  They say she was gorgeous, a beautiful, beautiful woman, right, but he didn't.  Sometimes I think he might have killed himself from getting into his age.  They says, one day he was taking a wheelbarrow, and he couldn't go up the hill, a little slight slope.  And that's when he committed suicide.  I think it could have been other things.  He may not have been able to--this is my imagination--to get it up.  They didn't have Viagra.  And you know, he, he--something like that, right.  But, and then he wrote a letter, you know, and people don't know how to handle all that.  The police took the letter, and they can't get it back, and now it's all over now.  You know, that's way back 1930-something, '30 [1930], '36 [1936] or something like that.
Story_ID: 317060
Speaker 1: So what about how--your father, what was your father's name?
Speaker 2: Edward Clark [Edward Clark, Sr.], 'cause he had to take on the--I'm a junior.  He had to take on the, the name.  He didn't have a name.  He, he was--it's, his real father, you know, disowned him.  You know, in Louisiana, you know what they have on, on the birth certificate?  Bastard child of so and so, even now.  That's Louisiana, right.  So I don't even think he had a birth certificate.  He was born out in the swamp somewhere.  You know, she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you know what year he--what his birthday is?
Speaker 2: Yeah, April 27th, 19, 1906.  And he, he's--what I want to say about him?  He was very bright, you know, but he, he didn't have no education either, but he was very bright, good at numbers and whatnot.  He would have been--I remember the first thing when we were living in Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  He would be sitting on the floor.  He's only twenty years older than me, see, exactly.  So if I'm ten, he's thirty.  He's a young man.  And he would be marking cards to cheat, which it--I thought nothing about that one way or the other.  He would be sitting--he'd take the diamond deck.  And with that little, you know, sable brush he'd make the diamond fatter up in the left side and on the other side.  But that's not very--so he could know as he's, he's doing this: ten high, you know, ten down, and then ace to, you know, like that three categories.  And I would be sitting on the floor, and he'd say shit.  You know, he'd miss a deal just like that, you know.  Then he'd put the bet--and if it's a Bicycle [Bicycle Playing Cards] deck, he'd, he, he takes the--and take a spoke out, right, like that.  But he--what I say about him?  But he can--then he takes cellophane and, and put the package back, you know.  Well, of course, if you're really suspicious that won't work, but he, he was very careful.  What you do, in the middle of a game with people drinking, you throw in the new deck.  No one doubts what it is, but it's marked, right.  So he must have made some money.  But one time he got caught I think 'cause he, he was cut.  I didn't never see it.  He couldn't--he was ashamed to come home.  But he could heal for some reason.  You know, a couple of years later you couldn't see anything on him.  So, you know, he's like trying to be slick and had been my mother [Merion Hutchinson Clark] was like--this is the midst of Depression [Great Depression] now.  I mean, there was no way, there was no way--I mean, until Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] came and made--'cause there was gonna be a revolution.  They said any time you see the kind of men who gonna--who want to work and not working, that's when you got a problem.  And they could tell that, and Roosevelt and them.  They did everything.  They just started putting money--they didn't even wait for paperwork.  They put money in--I mean they put boxes in the alley like the Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] thing.  They did, you know, they gave jobs, right, the WPA [Works Progress Administration] right.  Just get off the street, right, you know, like that, okay.
Story_ID: 316519
Speaker 1: Here to continue to talk about your father [Edward Clark, Sr.].  But what I'd like to know specifically: you said your father was marking the cards.  Was your father a professional gambler?
Speaker 2: Well, that's all he did at that point, right, you know.  But you know, it was like hit and miss.  We would be, we would be--they have no electric in this place, right.  I remember that.  I didn't care about that, but it'll give you an idea how this was, right.  This was really country, right, even was in the city, Baton Rouge [Louisiana].  Not that kind of country, but it's not out in the boondocks.  But he, you know, and he was younger, and she's [Clark's mother, Merion Hutchinson Clark] not, she never went out.  As, as long as we were kids--and I was telling someone else, we moved up to Chicago [Illinois], the Great Migration--but as long as we were kids, he--we never ate in a restaurant.  Now that seems terrible, but no, but nobody--and I was telling someone else that, a real bourgeois girl back in Chicago.  Now, she said, "We didn't either, not once."  I mean, we might--not her--we might go to, what you call it, a diner, where you sit on a stool, and have chili, but not her, she didn't do that.  The nearest we come to doing that, she'd take us to the five and dime in Chicago and Louisiana and get a hot dog, you know, on the, sitting like that, right.  But see, all this, see, she couldn't, you know, she wouldn't take us to the French Quarters [French Quarter, New Orleans, Louisiana], right, because she knew that we might experience insults.  You know, they may say, "No, you can't come here," so she never--she avoided that, right.
Speaker 1: What was your father's background?  What was your father's father?
Speaker 2: He was the sheriff of Louisiana.  I'm not sure--and he would--and, and his mother was, must have been sixteen when he impregnated her, right.  So, we're not sure if he was a sheriff at the time he was born there, but he was known as the sheriff.  And he's like a Wyatt Earp type.  He was a--you know, they'd--but he'd tell me stories about how he shot it out with some black guy.  I mean, that's easy to do.  You know, I mean, you know, like I mean, no, I mean you might get killed, but they talk about it.  And that must be in the papers.  We're trying to track him down right.
Story_ID: 316520
Speaker 1: When his mother died, his mother --
Speaker 2: You're father's [Edward Clark, Sr.] mother?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She, she left a, a lot of money.  Not a lot of money, but if you go way back then, you know, maybe like two houses and thirty thousand dollars, right.  Well, you could live--in Paris [France] on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944], you could live back in those days--it was a hundred dollars or seventy-five [dollars], you could live a whole month, pay your rent, and you know, and whatnot.  So, that was a lot of money, right, and he, he got it all.  And, and I remember though in one year he squandered it, you know.  I could see what he was doing, even though I'm all right, you know.  I knew he was gonna give me money to go back to Paris, which he did.  But, but he, he would be calling up the bookie in Chicago [Illinois] making bets, right, you know, like that.  And then we got ready--okay, the whole thing was over--they were taking care of his-the estate.  And what he did, when we went up to Chicago, he rented the whole car, 'cause he didn't want us to ex--to, to, to get into the Jim Crow.  But even the white conductor was back there drinking and the porter.  Everybody was drinking.  It was all on him.  You know that had to cost a lot, relatively speaking, you know.  But I'll never forget that.  We're all in there.  He say, "Your daddy is rich now," like that, right.  He was generous if he had money.
Speaker 2: So where were you taking that car from?  From Louisiana to Chicago?
Speaker 1: This is a, this is a reg- regular train, you know.
Speaker 2: Car, right, the regular--
Speaker 1: You know, with--
Speaker 2: --train car.  Yeah, I understand.
Speaker 1: Yeah, regular train.
Speaker 2: But where were you taking the train to?
Speaker 1: Chicago, but it had to change, you had to change trains I think at Little Rock [Arkansas] or something like that.  And that's when the Jim Crow is over.  But you know, from, if you're going south from Chicago, you could stay on the, you know, the Illinois Central [Illinois Central Railroad].  When you get to Little Rock or one of them, those, those towns, you have to, to go to the black coach, you know.
Speaker 2: So you were coming from Chicago to Louisiana--
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  We were already--I've confused you.  We were already, when his mother died, we were all--he went down to take care of business, and I was in Paris.  They sent for me.  And I flew from Paris to Chicago and got my butt down there, you know, early.  He didn't have to give--I told him, I said so that, that's right, she just died about a month ago, the, the, the one on the black and white.  And I said you know, he didn't have to give us anything.  We were adults, nothing, right, but he, you know.  But he, if he had it, he had it, you know.
Speaker 2: What was your father's mother like?  What was her name?
Speaker 1: Betsy [ph.], Betsy, and she was married once or twice.  I don't know, but she wasn't married.  Yes, she was.  She was married when--she would not acknowledge us because she was ashamed.  She was only sixteen when she had him, see, and she was ashamed that she ignored him, her own son.  And she sent her brother to medical school, right, but nothing for him.  So, she was--we never--but we would write.  And occasionally, he would go--when we were in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], he'd take the train to Hoboken [New Jersey], you know--and that was a big thing, then, jump on a train to go to Alexandria [Virginia]--to get money, to see if she could give us money so we could go up to Chicago.  And he--I, I remember--my sister [Shirley Clark] remember--it was like three hundred dollars right.  And that gave us--so we took the Greyhound bus, and we went to Chicago.  And then it was like the frying pan to the skillet.  We got to Chicago.  We moved to a kitchenette, and a kitchenette's a chic word.  But you look at kitchenette, you know, bed bugs and all that stuff like that, right, all of us in one, one room.  And he, and he was always trying.  Since he's a gambler, a lot of times he's not home, you know.  Oh, he's probably live, living with, with another woman and all of that.  He's a pretty boy.
Story_ID: 316521
Speaker 1: What about your siblings?  How many siblings did you have?
Speaker 2: I had one sister [Shirley Clark].
Speaker 1: One sister.
Speaker 2: That's it.
Speaker 1: And you, you had the same mother [Merion Hutchinson Clark] and father [Edward Clark, Sr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What do you remember about your--I mean, we talked about them being your, your parents' parents.  But what do you remember about your grandparents as your grandparents?  Like, how did you interact with them, your mother's parents?
Speaker 2: Well, anyway, back to his mother, my grandmother [Betsy (ph.)].  She never acknowledged us.  And one other thing was happening: one the side of her family where her brother was legit, she had promised to leave, whenever she died, money to one of those kids, all right, 'cause she really didn't know.  But apparently what had happened, they had one--they were a really smart family.  One became a principal of (unclear) high school--the other-they're all really smart.  But one was absolutely retarded, like, like this, okay.  And so, we didn't know.  And one time, in, in the '50s [1950s], she came up to Chicago [Illinois].  And I remember I was in the rumble seat, and she kept looking back at me.  And my father knew the story.  I didn't.  She was looking back.  "He's not retarded, you know.  He may be a devil or something."  I won't exaggerate.  And that changed everything, you know, because all that time they told her, "Well, we got a cross to bear," and they got a cross, because I was kicked out of Catholic school twice and high school about seven times, a delinquent, right, you know (laughter).  But that was, that's what, that's not the part (unclear) when I went in the, the [U.S.] Air Force to be a pilot.  But you know, so I wasn't dumb.  But anyway, she, she wrote me a letter in Paris [France], says, "I, I'm sorry that we never did get to know each other," right, like that.  But when she died, everybody went to where she was in Alexandria [Virginia].  When my father got down there they were--she was dead.  There were holes all in the wall, you know, what people do.  They go and they're looking for where she might have had some cash, right, or a will or something like that, right.  And you know, but he got it all.  At the, they say at they--here were these other people who had said I was retarded, and they were all at the table.  The lawyer was reading, and he had a--when he was born out in the swamps, his--another aunt was there.  And the lawyer asked, "Do you--."  "Yes, it's him."  And then he said you know--I don't know if he said he get it all, but he meant (unclear) and now they said oh, and he said oh.  Nowadays, they get--she'd get another lawyer, but, you know.  But one year, he was broke (laughter), but what a year, right, what a year--
Speaker 1: What a year--

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What are your earliest memories of growing up in Storyville [New Orleans, Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Technically, that's Storyville.  How, how Storyville came about, apparently, was somewhere around the turn of the turn of the century, maybe the time I was born.  It got so bad with the musicians and these whorehouses and you know, that they, they decided, you know.  And then the light-skinned ones didn't want to be with the dark-skinned ones.  Jelly Roll Morton, you know, he was a racist.  And that's a Creole.  You can't go by the name, Morton, no, no, French name.  And, and so, then they, they said okay, then you can't go nowhere else.  And they roped, now they roped off the area.  Yeah, so I'm technically in Storyville, yeah, yeah, Claiborne Avenue.  But I'm a little boy.  That's not like--
Speaker 1: What do you remember your earliest memories of being a little boy in that community?  What can you remember?
Speaker 2: A beautiful city, New Orleans [Louisiana].  We were living in New Orleans then, I remember, the same avenue, Claiborne Avenue, with the lights.  And in the springtime, I remember also making wine, the grownups.  And the pretty girls were in the barrel, right.  You know, I'm kind of looking at their legs even then, right.  They say when I was a little boy that I used to like--they didn't have nylon then.  That came in World War II [WWII].  I used to like to rub the, the women's legs, but that wouldn't necessarily be sexual.  What I liked to know--and I joked--I said unless I looked up, you know (laughter), that's what's meaning.  But you know, just to see--like a cat will do all of that.  But that sounds like me, you know.  But I remember they were some beautiful women.  They looked kind of Polynesian-type, you know, all that.
Story_ID: 316523
Speaker 1: What do you remember about holidays, your--like your family's life, like holidays, special events, daily life?
Speaker 2: The only holidays--my mother [Merion Hutchinson Clark] was that Catholic Catholic, you know, First Communion, coronation [sic. Confirmation], all that kind of thing, right, but Fourth of July, yes, you know, Well, Christmas, yeah, Christmas was nice, you know.  And I remember she would--she didn't have no money most of that time.  And I remember one time I wanted this train.
Speaker 1: You wanted what?
Speaker 2: A train.  I had a train.  And I'll never forget, she must have--I don't what she did, but she came with that train, and I didn't want the train.  I didn't tell her that.  You know, I'd just outgrown it.  But that's the kind of mother she was.  The other things she would do, and this is a sad story a little bit: I got on CNN.  They got me on the Great Depression.  I got the tape from CNN, me and others.  She used to go and window shop, right.  She had no money.  She, she, she'd be a spendthrift if she had money.  She'd go to Marshall Field's [Marshall Field & Company, Chicago, Illinois].  This is up in Chicago [Illinois].  And then she'd go get little samples, like little nuts, like little cashew nuts, very expensive, right, and come home with it.  She was feeding us like a bird, that's what that was, you know, some nourishment, you know, like that.  And the story I tell on CNN, I told it, I said I remember up in Chicago when I'd go to Catholic school, they didn't have a lunch program.  You had to take your lunch.  And a couple of times they, the boys would say, "Oh, Edward [HistoryMaker Edward Clark]," they'd call me Edward, "he's got a grease sandwich."  What they meant is my mother, what I knew, she had taken the night before and put the white bread in gravy.  You know, that's some nourishment.  But so, we had a hard time, but I was always healthy, even now, here, I'm seventy-nine.  I don't even know--you know, I don't intend to go.  But all them other guys are gone, so I'm (laughter), Jesus, Muhammad, Confucius (laughter), all of them, Moses, right, you know.

Speaker 1: What street did you live on when you were in New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Claiborne Avenue.
Speaker 1: Describe Claiborne Avenue.
Speaker 2: It's a wide boulevard.  They used to say in between they'd have a little green.  They'd call that neutral ground, you know, like a wide, pretty avenue.  And I remember we'd run across the street, very nice.  I liked that, you know, but it still wasn't ours.  We were living (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It wasn't what?
Speaker 2: No, we were living with--it was all, always living with other, relatives, you know, her sister and all of that.  And the same thing, when we got up to Baton Rouge [Louisiana], I mean, she [Clark's mother, Merion Hutchinson Clark] and his [Clark's father, Edward Clark, Sr.] aunt was always, they were arguing.  And the aunt--my, my mother would call her an old woman, and she said, "I ain't no old woman."  "You're too old for my boy," like that.  And then you--this'll be hard for you to believe.  She said, "Look at him."  He come up--talking about me (unclear), "Look, he come out dark," you know.  This don't get, don't--we ain't getting--this, this is not sun tan; that's permanent.  I can hypnotize some people.  They'll think I'm, they'll think--'cause I've had that to happen even in Africa, right.  Some guy was, some racist, on the, on the mammy wagon.  He--after talking about how stupid the black people, then he realized, he said "Well, my, that's a nice tan you got."  I said, "I'm born with it."  And then something said--to him, right, like he said too much, right.  Anyway, so--
Speaker 1: So, what was the, the--you said the Claiborne Avenue was very beautiful.  What do you, what else do you remember about like some of the people that were in the neighborhood?  Who were some of the--
Speaker 2: I got to--see, you got me sitting here.  I'd like to show you the whole photograph, about twelve different people sitting.  Every one of them look like Puerto Ricans.  They were no--they, they would, they would make fun of dark people, right.  My mother would say we were living in Baton Rouge.  Right next to us were some people from--black people.  And she said, "Look at those old pickaninnies over there, you know, like that.  And I don't want you playing with them, right."  I mean, there's a race, race from the Creole.  And her own father [Frank Hutchinson] she said used to say back in Covington [Louisiana] or Madisonville [Louisiana] that the dog they had knew when black people were coming.  He meant black, black people, maybe working people with sweat--but I'm--whether that or not, but that's what said; that's the environment, you know.  And, but I remember--here's a little aside--I remember one time we're in Baton Rouge.  The, the storms come up in Louisiana, right, you know.  They had a pecan tree.  It was on the other side of the fence, but it leaned on our side.  And when it rained the pecans would drop, right.  And then they'd send their kids over to pick up the pecans, right, you know, even if they were some of my friends.  Boy, my aunt was mad.  She'd say all kinds of nasty things, right.  She looked like her, and the guys she was--Mr. Clark looked white.  You couldn't tell.  He looked like--you ever seen Romare Bearden?  Looked like, that kind of looked like he's an Eastern European.  That's what Mr. Clark looked and not my blood.  That's not my blood.  But, and then I used to say now, legally what happens there?  It's their tree.  It's on our side, and they come on our fence.  And they say no, they can't really do that.  Well, anyway, they did it, right, you know, pecans everywhere, you know.  So, stories like that, right.  And then the Catholic school was terrible.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: -let--before you get into the Catholic school, let's just--so, racism was rampant amongst black people in Storyville section of New Orleans--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, but we don't think--if you're in it, you don't think of it racism, right.  I mean, but, but anyway, it didn't matter to me.  I never, you know, I was always like, doesn't matter.  But, but, but yeah, that's racism, but it wasn't, you know, no.  I mean, we, I knew we couldn't go in the French Quarters [French Quarter, New Orleans, Louisiana], and you know, we're all black.
Story_ID: 316525
Speaker 1: So at that time, when you were in the community, I know you were just a little boy, but were there community leaders that you looked up to?  Were there people in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Too small--
Speaker 1: Who led the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Too, too, too young for that at that point, you know, to get into that.
Speaker 1: Then, when you--at that time then, who did you look up to in the neighborhood?  Who were the people that you idolized?
Speaker 2: I'll tell you what I idolized and what's important for a lot of us and don't realize this: it was--you know what one of the most influential things that happened to us, me, you--and you, you too young to remember--is Joe Louis.  Now, Joe Louis was, you know, Max Schmeling, that, that second fight, he knocked him out in the first round.  Let's say he hadn't knocked him out, it'd been the other way around.  I don't know if we be--I just interpret we could do everything better, anything, in science, any--I didn't even think about it.  There's a sports guy, right, like that.  Do you know, what, what, what, the way we got through was through sports.  You take Jesse Owens--it had to be a definite; it can't be one of these things where like you say fencing and something and they say well, his artistry wasn't good enough.  Jesse Owens, who gets there first, the black man.  The rest of the party's over, same way in boxing.  I mean, Joe Louis was so, so, such certain, the money wasn't--he wasn't bragging like Holly [sic. Evander Holyfield].  The money was what round would he put the man to sleep, you know.  But I just felt it.  I didn't think anything else about it, anything, anything.  But let's say you think about it.  If he'd lost that fight, if he'd ran down out of the ring (laughter)--because you heard all those stories.  The radio would be on all down the street.  People would start screaming.  Yeah Joe Louis.
Speaker 1: So do you remember that day of the fight?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but there were many fights.
Speaker 1: Many fights--
Speaker 2: Every time he fought.
Speaker 1: Every time he fought.  So--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that--
Speaker 1: So you'd gather around the radio to listen to it?
Speaker 2: You'd hear it somebody else's house, yeah, yeah.  We didn't have a radio in the South.  I remember when we got our first radio, went up to Chicago [Illinois].  I mean, it's the first radio we ever had, you know.  We just didn't have one.  But life went on without it, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, when you don't have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what year is it that the Joe--what years were Joe Louis fighting that had this influence on you?
Speaker 2: Oh, it must have been around 1939 or '40 [1940].  I don't know like that.
Story_ID: 316526
Speaker 1: So when you think about thinking back on those days, what are some of the, some of the sounds, or sights, or smells that remind you of Storyville [New Orleans, Louisiana] in your early days of life?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I miss it.  And what, what I really miss, they put the thruway over it.  It go--it--not all of it, but that killed it.  In, in fact, where that, where we were living there's a pillar right there now, you know, big, old, ugly, gray structure, you know.  Yeah, that's too bad, because it was nice--well, they've got other nice streets, you know.  But it's still--you've been there?  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what are some of the sights or smells that remind you of New Orleans [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it does have a smell, right.  You know what else had a smell, was Paris [France].  Everybody know that, when we would, when we first went there, right.  It could be that the French people on the weekend are fucking all the time, and their sweating on the, the Metro [Paris Metro], right, you know.  But see, that--as, as soon as you say that about their filthy women, they had one thing going that the American women were ashamed to use, the bidet.  See, in other words, they might be sweaty, but they're clean here.  They keep that kissing clean, right (laughter).  I remember I went on the Liberte on over there.  They had a bidet on the boat.  I didn't know what it was.  When I first got to Paris, went to a hotel.  They had a bidet.  I couldn't figure it out.  They didn't have a--the toilet was in the hall.  Of course you could wee-wee in it, but you couldn't do nothing else, you know (unclear) but it does have a smell, Louisiana.  That's true.  I could-now since you said it, I can think it.  I wish I could go back to smell that smells, you know, right.
Speaker 1: What was that smell like?
Speaker 2: Not P-U-S-S-Y (laughter) sorry--no.  I don't know--a musk smell and maybe the soil out there.  Louisiana, that terrain, that terrain is, is beautiful.  I relate to it more than, the terrain, more than up in New England and whatnot, you know, even though that can be beautiful.  But there, it's, it's with the weeping willows and the big oak trees and all of that, right.
Story_ID: 316527
Speaker 1: Where did you go to the first grade, elementary school?  You were a cat--you went to a Catholic school.  What was the name of it (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, in Baton Rouge [Louisiana], yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you left New Orleans [Louisiana].  And what year did you move to Baton Rouge?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  It must have been 1931 or something like that.  But--
Speaker 1: And you started first grade?
Speaker 2: Yes--no, kindergarten.
Speaker 1: Kindergarten.
Speaker 2: They call it primer.  And I couldn't read.  Well, you don't read.  And I can remember to this day, I memorized the first book, "Alice said come cat, come to dinner.  The cat said no, I'll find my dinner."  We got a cat here.  He'd love that one.  She'd love that one.  But they hated--Shirley [Shirley Clark] is my sister and I.  She--we're almost the same age, eleven months apart.  And she would--we would say we're going up north.  This, the, the nun was black, but she hated us.  I could tell, like, you know.  We didn't know what it meant.  I told you when we got up there we were in a kitchenette, but we didn't know that.  We going up north; you know, we're gonna have a better and you, right, like this.  And that's the first time--I remember she couldn't stand me when one time there was a drawing con--not a drawing contest.  She said--what was it?  She said, "We gonna draw a tree."  Okay, so she put some kind of thing on the blackboard.  And everybody else did the tree with the bubble and all that.  I did the branches.  Now whoever won was to get the gold star.  She just dismissed the class instead of giving me the gold star, right.  But that helped me, because at that point I knew that I might be rejected all my life.  What could be better, right?  I knew 'cause it was obvious.  The kids knew it.  See, if, if you're with kids that age, it's not black--like, right now you encourage them to be look like Matisse [Henri Matisse] and spontaneous, and then you had to kind of draw more correctly, as you want to put it that way, right.  And I notice all about--kids will stop--and not just me, but if a kid's drawing that way, they'll stop and get quiet and go around and look at the kid who draws correctly, right.  Other words, the nun couldn't draw like me.  And so, you know, but that helped me.  You know, like I, I had a whole lot of rejections, you know, and, and just thought about those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: So do you remember that nun's name?
Speaker 2: I think it was John Joseph [ph.], Sister John Joseph.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: You know, and my sister just died.  But I know something else who I met years later, years later, when I was a visiting artist in Louisiana State [Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana].  And this girl I was fooling around with had a kid, and it turned out that some New Orleans Saint [New Orleans Saints] basket--I mean football player--and she took me over to see the kid, and it turned out that that, that, that that football player's mother was in the same school the same time, right.  So I wanna call one time to find out about that, right.
Story_ID: 316528
Speaker 1: We're rolling on tape three now.  You were talking about pre-k or kindergarten school and talking about your elementary years with the nuns.  What, what was, like, the four through the sixth grades like?  Were you still in Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Were you still in Baton Rouge [Louisiana]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we went--the school in Chicago [Illinois] is called St. Ashland's [ph.].
Speaker 1: So you left Baton Rouge and went to Chicago?  At what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: When did you leave Baton Rouge?  What grade were you in?
Speaker 2: You know, the, that was primer and whatnot, first, so when we got to Chicago, you know, I had to start like at the second or something like that, you know, like that.  But they kept me behind right away.  But this had nothing to do with racism, because I couldn't read at the standard.  And every--my sister [Shirley Clark] went ahead, you know, and things like--but when I got to the fourth grade I still couldn't read.  And if you can't read, you know, I'm sitting and that's an embarrassing thing, because then you get left.  If the teacher's talking about--especially if it's English.  They be talking about mythology.  They didn't teach science.  I was always interested in that later on.  But you know, there's nothing you can do.  And they, they wouldn't even help me.  I remember when they put me on a high chair like this, and the teacher would have me reading.  And then the kids would get restless, start talking, and then say where were we?  And I'd go to the bottom and say continue.  You know, she should have said, "Hey, you come after school," right, like that.  So, but, but one other thing happened.  What did happened, around the fourth grade, or the third grade maybe--I don't know--one teacher asked me--they could see little by little I could draw, and she asked me if I would copy--and they were white--if I would copy a birthday card from her blood sister on the board.  Okay, you know, I'm strolling over that, and I did.  And then they begin to see.  I began to be so good at it that by the time I got to the fourth grade, the eighth grade teacher would ask me to do that, right.  Now see, that's the, that's the reason why the west has a history of art anyway, the Catholic church and the Renaissance for the church.  And then, I mean, I'm not religious, never was, but not anti-religion.  But I mean, they would have me--that, I mean, you know, I'd draw the Christ child and the crucifixion, the whole thing, you know, on the board.  The only thing I did was rearrange it, but I was only copying, you know.  And you know, and then it's, you know, it's like that.  But they kicked me--and I got to the sixth grade, and this--I remember Sister Cledice [ph.] was her name.  She looked like a monster.  But she failed me.  And if you fail, you, you're kept back the whole year.  And so now here comes the next year.  Now all my friends left me.  They're ahead of me.  The next year--and then it took my sister to tell me.  She comes because they used to post on the board what happened.  So this same nun, nun was saying won't she [Clark's mother, Merion Hutchinson Clark] be surprised.  You know, she gonna see if her son was--she failed me again.  Well, it took that for her to pull me out, you know.  She wanted me to go to Catholic--she also wanted me to be an altar boy, and I didn't want to be nobody's altar boy, right.  But and I couldn't have qualified anyway, you know.
Story_ID: 316529
Speaker 1: So, then we went over to public school.  Then I started doing better.  But then I got to high school.  Now the war [World War II, WWII] is on, and everybody's going to war, even the teachers.  And my whole thing is chasing girls and whatnot like that.  I remember that, so.  And one time I almost got--this is high school.  I had this girl up in the balcony when no one was there.  We're fooling around, not quite there.  And all of a sudden, I looked, and I saw this teacher.  He spotted, and I knew he knew me because he used to be in the--took care of the gym class and all of that thing, right.  That's how he knew me.  I couldn't run, right.  The next day the police knock on the door, you know, for statutory rape.  The only thing, it took them two--a month or so to find out I was also a minor, so (laughter).  They tried to send me to reform school, that kind of thing.  But then I got serious.  I wanted to be a pilot, so I started taking classes in, you know, physics and all that kind of stuff, and A-plus student just like that.  But you know--
Speaker 2: You started taking classes.  You got serious.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You wanted to become a pilot.
Speaker 1: --because you had to, to, to be there you had to pass the tests, and--
Speaker 2: So at that point in your life, did you see yourself being a pilot more so than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's the only thing I wanted to be.  And, and I--and, and you know, like all young fools, I didn't realize that, you know, I, I romanticized it, until I saw this thing on TBS, whatever it is, you know, it was--and talked about London [England] during the war.  Was in color, and they showed those pilots then that I'd never heard that when it's--you know, I just thought when you die and they go like this.  And, and say, "You're the Red Baron," and I wave to you, "Comrade," right, shit, you scream, you're burning to death, right.  I didn't know that, see.  But anyway, yeah, and I wanted to be alone, right.  And that was the, the, the black outfit, the, the 79th--69th [sic.] or something like that, right.  But I didn't make it, even though I passed the test.  The psychologist--the, the war was winding down, even though I went overseas anyway.
Speaker 2: What year are we talking about?
Speaker 1: Forty-four [1944]--
Speaker 2: Okay, so what year did you graduate high school?
Speaker 1: I didn't.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you left high school.  You were gonna go to the [U.S.] Army--the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Forces; U.S. Air Force] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But they gave you credit in the Army--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --if, you know--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and I took some tests, you know, 'cause to go Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], where I went, you had to have finished high school.
Speaker 2: Okay, so you, tell me how you got--
Speaker 1: I didn't finish--
Speaker 2: --to the Air Force.  You didn't--
Speaker 1: I didn't finish high school.
Speaker 2: Right, you didn't finish school.
Speaker 1: Right, no.
Speaker 2: How did you get to the Air Force?
Speaker 1: Well, you didn't have to then.  Now you do, right.  All you had to do was pass.  They were desperate, right.  You had to pass.
Speaker 2: So you passed the test, you say.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I passed the test.
Speaker 2: But the psychologist--
Speaker 1: But what happened, when, before I went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Army Airfield; Sharpe Field, Tuskegee, Alabama], to go to Tuskegee the psychiatrist--and he's white.  That don't mean he's great.  He, he's looking at just what you looking at.  He said, "I see you didn't finish high school."  Now he saw the grades, the scores.  It was okay.  He said--I said, "Oh, I was putting my sister [Shirley Clark] through," that's a lie, "through college," you know, like that.  But I'm lying now, just to--.  You know, I should have said you know, right now, look, doesn't matter.  I can fly those planes, right.  And then he asked me, he said, "What, what's, what's a Mustang [P-51 Mustang]?"  The plane is called Mustang.  Well, I didn't know Mustang was a horse, see.  And he said, "Put your hands in front of me."  You know, and I was doing this right.  Disqualified.  But I had a real aptitude.  I did fly once, you know, a beginning plane.  But I had the aptitude.  I was ahead of everybody, you know.  But anyway, that really hurt me.  And then I went abroad.  They sent me off to Guam.
Speaker 2: So you, you did go to the Air Force?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: But you didn't go into the pilot training program [Civilian Pilot Training Program] that you wanted to.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 316530
Speaker 1: So they sent you off to--?
Speaker 2: They put me in this--and I was showing--you know, I'm tied to this seat.  I can't show you these things.  Because I was showing someone the other day my, my, my discharge.  At eighteen I was a sergeant major.  You can't get no higher than that unless you're an officer.  Well, the island in Guam they didn't have any black officers, except the chaplain.  And I felt sorry for him because he was a snob.  They wouldn't eat with him, and he wouldn't eat with us.  He should have just come on out and say, hey, you know, like that, and anyway.  So, anyway, but yeah, I became a sergeant major.  And, and, and it's on my discharge--(sneeze).
Speaker 1: Bless you.
Speaker 2: And we were bored on Guam, you know, God darn.  See, we--and I felt like, I felt like, damn, you know, the, they were everybody there.  All the--you know, and they, they were waiting to go into, not Okinawa [Okinawa Island, Japan], but Iwo Jima [Japan].  I was there in our outfit.  And those guys were making fun of us, right.  If we were on the streets, you know, or something, they had their weapons on them.  They took the weapons from us, right, 'cause the moment the boat landed--we landed on a landing bar.  The moment the boat landed, you know, they, they--we were on the tents on the beaches and all of that.  The war [World War II, WWII] is secure, but they still had some Japanese until just recently there, right, shooting.  But that night--luckily I'm alive here--they started shooting through the tent.  That was another black outfit.  They didn't, they didn't know who we were, right (laughter), so they took all the guns away (laughter), put the women off limit and all that shit.
Speaker 1: So how did that experience in the [U.S.] Army end?  Did you--you were honorably discharged in what year?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Army you can't be no higher than sergeant major, yeah.
Speaker 1: It's the Army or the Air Force [U.S. Army Air Forces; U.S. Air Force]?
Speaker 2: Air Force.
Speaker 1: Air Force.
Speaker 2: It was still called--it was, yeah, it was one then, yeah, you know.
Speaker 1: So what year were, did you leave the Army?
Speaker 2: In '45 [1945] I think. Well, when they dropped the bomb.  Maybe the end of '45 [1945], yeah.
Story_ID: 316531
Speaker 1: And then in 1947 you registered into the Art Institute of Chicago [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: --using your G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].
Speaker 2: --even before that.
Speaker 1: Before that.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so, you know, I went straight.  I wanted to go to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] to study science, but I never could spell, and I heard they didn't give a--see, they, they give you--if you've served, and you are young like that, they, then the [U.S.] Army, you know, you practically, you did finish high school.  But anyway, I tell it the way it is.  But--I forgot--oh, yeah, the University of Chicago didn't have a multiple test, and I couldn't see me talking about centrifugal force and inertia, struggling with the spelling, right.  So the best thing happened.  I went into the art school, right.
Speaker 1: So, what, what, what, what was, what--who helped you decide to go to art school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, just me--
Speaker 1: --or what made you decide to go to art school?
Speaker 2: --me, me.  I always knew.  All my life I knew I was gonna be, try to be the best one.  I never thought of anything but being the best at anything, from the drawing and the--that I just knew.  I was so--did, did I tell you in the drawing, I was so good at that someone else said they saw another guy in a school somewhere.  I went over and looked at it, right.  And you know, in those kind of, that type of--art's subjective but not if you're copying.  The copying is, is simple, who got--who copies the best, right.  That don't mean you're the best.  Well, that's was the yardstick for me.  I'm looking at the guy--somewhere the eyes were too big or something, right.  I knew I wouldn't do that right, you know, so I went on back, you know, with my ego right (laughter).  Yeah, when I was painting that picture, I was trying to--I'll--but that's a--I'll paint Michel [Michelangelo]--I mean Da Vinci's [Leonardo da Vinci] 'Mona Lisa' there.  I didn't, but I'm saying, you know.  I think if it had been a woman, it might have had a little more thing going.  But I got every piece of the flesh.  Nobody can even copy that picture, because it's done a way that's, that's, that would be impossible to copy.
Speaker 1: So you, you land.  You use your G.I. Bill, the G.I. Bill--
Speaker 2: G.I. Bill.
Speaker 1: --to go to--
Speaker 2: That change, that changed everything, I mean the white artist too.  All the ones in Europe were on the G.I. Bill, right.  Some of them--in fact, that's the Sam Francis, Al L. [Al Loving], George (unclear), so, I mean, all these artists over there, right.  And they're not the type that could have come from the family's money, like before the war [World War II, WWII], right.  That made it possible.  You got $75 a month if you were single, or $110 if you were married, but they paid your tuition, and that could be trade school or Oxford [University of Oxford, Oxford, England], if you qualify, right.  And yeah, you know, like that.  So they--yeah, and, and that, you had enough to pay rent in a cheap place if you budget yourself and eat (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now when--I'm sorry.  Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and, and eat in a restaurant.  And you--
Speaker 1: So when you arrived at the art school of Chica--Art Institute--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --of Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At that time I'm assuming there were not a lot of black students.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And so--
Speaker 2: But it didn't seem like a problem.  They had some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) It didn't seem like a problem.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And the--and you feel that the G.I. Bill sort of broke down some barriers because it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, you know, a lot of black even now.  You know, there's a lot of blacks are, when they look at the possibility of making some money, they're not too interested any more, right, you know.  I mean they went--
Speaker 1: Interested in?
Speaker 2: In becoming an artist, you know.  No, they're (unclear) we got some great artists.  I know most of them, you know.  But I'm talking about the, the, the new--they're not too interested, right, at it like that.  So, yeah, I forgot what you said (unclear).  No, but the school was different than now.  And, and school then, you had to start--it was almost like the Beaux-Arts [Ecole Nationale Superieure Des Beaux-arts] of Paris [France], right, which is not the school to go to these days.  In other words, you started with still life drawing the first year and, and related courses.  And the next year, the whole next year you start with still life and, and then figure drawing.  And then you start with still life painting and then figure painting, right, and now they don't go that route, right, so.  But it was like that kind of school, you know.
Speaker 1: So at the Art Institute of Chicago, who were some of your memorable instructors?
Speaker 2: This guy, Lou, Louis Ritman, R-I-T-M-A-N, the one who knew Monet [Claude Monet], the one who had lived in France, the one who showed me the paper, you know.  He's the one that influenced me mostly on that type of thing, and that's like science right, reflected colors, you know.  Even now, luminosity of color, see the picture there is luminous.  Well, the sun's on it now.  So we do get--because the reason we get some sun is because Manhattan's [New York, New York] not exactly north south.  It goes on an angle, so this month we get a little bit.  So it's, it's all different in my studio now.
Story_ID: 316532
Speaker 1: So in 1952 or thereabouts, you de--
Speaker 2: Went to Paris [France].
Speaker 1: --you decide to leave Chicago [Illinois] and go to Paris.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: What brought about that decision?
Speaker 2: That changed my life.  I didn't even know you could go.  I just thought once you signed up, that was it, right; I didn't know.  And then I met some Japanese American went to Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], had just come back, and he started telling me about Paris.  I couldn't believe I could go, right.  And so that changed my life too, you know, when I went.
Speaker 1: So tell me about that.  Did you know other--like, because Paris was, had become somewhat of a mecca for black people back in the '20s [1920s], and then it changed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: And then it, I guess in the '50s [1950s], it was having I guess somewhat of a rebirth for African American artists.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, in the twent--World War I [WWI] is when--what are you gonna do down on the farm after you see Paris, you know.  Black guys were getting those beautiful French girls and all that kind of stuff.  They'll never gonna go back.  And, and some were still there, were still actually deserting when I got there in the '50s [1950s].  I met a few that never, never come back, right.  But that's, that's not even important.  But, yeah, I never seen--I couldn't believe Paris.  I mean--
Speaker 1: So tell me, you--
Speaker 2: 'Cause I'm not a New Yorker then, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'm from--
Speaker 1: You're from Chicago.
Speaker 2: I mean, I, I couldn't believe they had that much energy in something had nothing to do with America.
Speaker 1: Say that again.  You couldn't believe that--
Speaker 2: That, that, that all the energy that the city has.  Well, we know New York [New York] has ener--its energy--but you know, I mean, it had nothing to do with us, right.  I mean, they--we not at a war with them, but it's nothing to do with--but, I mean, I said wow.  And I couldn't figure out the cities, 'cause it's old; it's cobwebbed.  You'd go right back--you start out here; you may end up right back.  I couldn't see any end to it, right.  Everywhere I went, right, it was more city, more city.  And it's not, but it's really a small city.  At night you could go around the periphery, you know, and some people can do it, you know.  This, the, the circle highway, you might can go around it in less than an hour, you know, and go across it if it was able to, you know, in, in twenty-five minutes.  But, and you're in it, you, you're immersed into that culture.  I couldn't believe that city, right.  It handed me the bread without paper, right, like that, you know.  They were, and they, they kind of nasty, but they, they, they had depth to them, you know.  They would be--you, you know.  What had happened was two sides to the story.  We stayed too damn long.  Okay, I mean, the military was on Rue Saint-Honore, you know.  We had a--it, it, you know, it look like a whole naval base, only not on the water and whatnot.   And you know, and so I think that De Gaulle [Charles de Gaulle] come, and he just stopped all that shit, right, you know (laughter).  They think that they got (laughter), they got an attitude.  They got a superiority complex, you know, yeah.
Story_ID: 316533
Speaker 1: So you studied in, in Paris [France].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Where did you study?
Speaker 2: Place called Academie de la Grande Chaumiere [Paris, France].  It's in, it's, we got it in this piece of paper here.
Speaker 1: And who, who were some of the instructors there that had a big (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A guy named--
Speaker 1: --influence on you?
Speaker 2: --Goerg [Edouard Goerg] and another guy named Odessa Zadkines [sic. Ossip Zadkine].  Zadkine was a sculptor and a real--there's, there's a museum now.  He's dead now, Musee Zadkine in Paris, right.  Apparently, he was here during the war because he was a, he was a Jew.  So he came over here.  So he spoke good English.  And I remember one time I decided, well, all this is on the government.  I'll try to take sculpture.  But you know, there's no--so unlike the Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], you'd have all pieces of paper.  You just go to the class here.  So I'm working, and I didn't want nobody to come around and tell me, even though I didn't know all that aperture thing.  So I worked on this thing two or three maybe weeks, because the teacher at the Art Institute, the teachers did everything.  In this case, they just walk in.  This is not the Beaux-Arts [Ecole Nationale Superieure Des Beaux-arts, Paris, France].  And they're like God.  Everybody, they like the ma--the master. They walk from easel to wheel, and all the students gather from easel to easel to watch the critique, right, like that.  So now he's coming to me.  And he's looking at it, and he said, "Ah, I see you're a painter."  But he's not looking at a painting.  I almost said my painter-liness is so strong.  He said, "You see, you've got the side, the side, the front.  You have to think round and organic, you know, you got it.  Yeah, it's all right."  So there goes Michelangelo, you know.  I mean, but you know, but that's, yeah, yeah, yeah, you mean as you drew it, don't think that I got the front and I got the side.  Obviously, you've got about the same proportion.  You can go measure it, but he mean as you're working.  I said yeah, that's Paris, you know.  And another one--and I used to use that when I'm a visiting artist.  They said I had good easel manners.  Another teacher would--he'd come in, 'cause I hadn't been in Paris long, and he'd look at my work.  He could probably see some influence, so he'd ask me if I knew of a certain artist.  Well, everybody knows Picasso [Pablo Picasso] and all them, but who I, I was to, to see, had met Roc [ph.].  But he, yeah, so he said, "Go, go to the museum and ask questions to the man"--he mean, he mean, you know, this is what the French do, a lot of imagery and about in New York [New York], about Matisse [Henri Matisse], who went to the Louvre [Musee du Louvre, Paris, France], and a lot of them, and Cezanne [Paul Cezanne], right.  He meant go, go, go, go and ask them questions.  He means visual questions, not, you know, like that.  I said well, they didn't do that, and they did not take attendance.  They didn't do that.  They didn't believe in it, this school.  Eventually, they got kicked off of the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] because of that, because it works two ways.  You've got to do what they say.  And when the, when the people found out, it used to be you could pick up your check.  It's where you go to the embassy--I mean go to wherever the head of office, and you'd get it.  Well, that was better than some ways.  But they found that some guys were not even in Paris, you know (laughter).  They bounce, they bounced some, they bounced some checks and gone, in Italy somewhere and they said--so these guys (unclear) Gallo.  We'd get around and they said, "Okay, look, if, if the school wouldn't take attendance," they say, "If you're not here three times, you're off the bill."  And when they said that, I never saw so many guys.  They must have had--I only saw a few guys at the school, right.  They must have had sixty guys there waiting around.  And one would be looking out for if these guys were coming, you know, like that.  It was--you know, most of those guys over there what that was about, most of them.  A lot of them had even been officers and whatnot.  A lot of them were taking art because you can't fail art hardly, you know.  And so, they were, they were just beating nine to five, you know, that point of life.  A lot of them just beating out, you know.  They avoided nine to five.
Story_ID: 316534
Speaker 1: And, but I was working like mad.  It's all written about me on all that.  But that's--
Speaker 2: Where were you working?
Speaker 1: No, always painting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean you were working and--
Speaker 1: --at studio--
Speaker 2: --you were, you were, you were--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --working.  You were an artist--
Speaker 1: Yeah, everybody know that--
Speaker 2: --yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, yeah, yeah.  They'd come to my studio.
Speaker 2: You were taking advantage of it.
Speaker 1: They'd say look like a chicken coop.  But anyway, you know, it was mine, and I'm working.  And you know, I had, I had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was motivating you at the time?
Speaker 1: I'm always to make something great, you know.  I just felt I had had--you know, I wasn't sat--and I was true.  I wasn't satisfied with, with, with--no, I mean, look, Picasso [Pablo Picasso] and them great, but I wasn't satisfied.  They were younger as far as they went, right.  I'm gonna get into abstract art.  I mean they--that, that, that not--I mean, some say it started in Russia.  It probably really started in Paris [France], and Kandinsky [Wassily Kandinsky] came down to Paris and looked at cubism.  But this is not figurative, you know.  I mean I was figurative.  You saw all those paintings, you know.  I mean, and, and (unclear) and, and they're selling for a lot of money.  I don't even own them.  One sold for--that chair I did sold for $40,000.  It's this big, and I don't even own it.  But I gave it to somebody back in the '50s [1950s], 'cause I'd given their sister something, and I thought well--and they didn't even hang it, right.  All the years I used to tell people, I said you know I gave him that painting of the chair, but I've never seen it on their wall.  Well, you can't go say put it on the wall, right, and I never said anything.  Then they sold it.
Speaker 2: So when you were in Paris, you knew moved into abstract art in like 1953, '54 [1954]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, about, yeah.
Speaker 2: What, what resulted?  How did you move from figurative painting into abstract?
Speaker 1: Yeah, good question.  That, that one on the cover of the other book.  I decided it's something I had never done.  And by the way, Gauguin [Paul Gauguin] and, and Van Gogh [Vincent van Gogh] used to argue about this, about, about working from nature.  I said no matter what I do, I'm always looking at what I do, right.  I said well, I'll try something else.  Give me this thing, this book here, 'cause, 'cause they got it reproduced here too.  And here I'm painting it, but I'll show it to you in color.
Speaker 2: Let me see.
Speaker 1: Here--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Pause) Oh, it had to be back here.  This one.
Speaker 2: Okay, can you hold that up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So I said--
Speaker 2: --for--just turn it around for the camera.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This.  And when I started I was--remember I'm using my imagination.  I'm not looking at landscape.  This one I'm looking at landscape, all right.  So then I started out, look, this is what's gonna be like a church, a cross, and buildings, but not an abstract in it, like cubism a little bit.  This was a tree, and this was the sun.  Well, it didn't work.  And then I said oh, fuck it, and I started getting the middle.  And then I said you know, I like the middle better than I like when I was trying to do--although this painting is one of the best I've done.  So, you know, I was fast getting into abstract after this.
Speaker 2: But that was the first one.  You titled that one 'The City.'
Speaker 1: 'The City,' yeah.
Speaker 2: Why is that?
Speaker 1: Well, because it is a city.  I had buildings and the tree and a church.  And then--
Speaker 2: Was the city Paris or in--
Speaker 1: Well, I guess any city.
Speaker 2: Any city.
Speaker 1: But it looks--the colors are un-American.  It's, it would look like the Mediterranean, the use of colors that they have down there.  But that, that's, that's not--no, because it's out of my imagination anyway, anyway.  And that's about--I did maybe two like that, and then I just said fuck it.  I'll just go, go abstract.  Let's see, is there one here that's--
Story_ID: 316535
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was it about abstract that--
Speaker 2: That makes you God.
Speaker 1: --really spoke to you?
Speaker 2: Look, and then there--depends how you look at it.  If I'm painting you, I'm a slave to you, right.  The other way, I can create what I want, you know.  I'm a slave to your likeness.  And someone once said way back in the Renaissance, said this artist, a Renaissance artist--where was he?  Goya [Francisco Goya]--not Goya; that's not Renaissance.  Italian, not, not Ducreux [Joseph Ducreux], but he said, he was said it this, "So I painted a hand; I painted a perfect hand.  What did I have?  Just another hand."  You know, you'll know it's perfect.  You know, that's, that was his logic, right, you know, Giotto that, "So I painted a hand, and that's true."  So, if I'm painting you--
Speaker 1: Just one second.  We're gonna--we can keep going?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Finish.
Speaker 1: Finish this story and then we'll change tape.
Speaker 2: Yeah, if I'm painting you--and there's nothing wrong.  That's some of the greatest art ever made, you know, and, and I've painted portraits of my wife and whatnot, and, but that's it.  The other way, you don't have to be here, you know.  But I'm being creative.  I'm thinking in another way.
Story_ID: 317061
Speaker 1: Continuing to roll on tape four.  And we--you had finished up the story about the, the hand.  You just want to wrap that story up.
Speaker 2: About the what?
Speaker 1: You were talking about the artist painted it, but it's just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Giotto.
Speaker 1: --a hand and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, Giotto.  Giotto says, you know, "So I paint the perfect hand."  He said but let's say that's impossible.  Let's say he did paint the perfect hand.  But then he said, "For what?"  You know, there were less people in the world then, but he might have said, said there's, you know, there's two billion people.  You know, it's another hand.  That's all that is.  See, you gotta be creative.  But what happened and, and that changed my life really, was in Paris [France] in '53 [1953] or something.  I had a show.  I heard there was a show in the American Center [Paris, France], not for Americans, because it's a very--but for, you know, some of the Ecole de Paris artists and whatnot.  But they had Americans.  But it was called Grandes Toiles du Montmartre.  That means--
Speaker 1: What was it called?
Speaker 2: Grand, grand, grand like grand means large, and toiles is artwork, from Montmartre [Paris, France].  That's the section of it, large works.  Well, they knew I worked large.  So some guys, some, some of the white guys said, "Hey, take the painting down there.  Maybe she'll put you in."  They'd already told--it was a woman, Wella Rudolph [ph.] was her name.  So, I went down to the American Center, and I wasn't--I don't if I was even at the opening.  But it was that, that painting, the, the one we're talking about, 'The City.'  And so I'm sitting in the Cafe Soleil one day, and this guy who was a French scholar, but American--'cause I can't read the Le Monde, see.  That's some old (unclear) so he said, "Ed [HistoryMaker Edward Clark], I see you're famous."  He's been affectionate.  So he read what it said: "Negro of great talent."  Well, I didn't want--I said why did it come to 'The City' that why they gonna make a reference to my race, right, you know.  This is, this not--I'm, I'm surprised to even know that's flattery; that's Le Monde.  That's the most prestigious paper in Europe.  It's like The New York Times of here.  So, anyway, someone said well, look, this guy, he's really big.  He's so, he's such a snob, he don't even use his--he uses an MCL.  His name is Michel Conil-LaCoste.  But he doesn't even use it, you know.  That's how famous he is.  He said, "Why don't you contact him and tell him."  So these--they used to have something called a pneumatic.  You could send a message through a tube.  They had them all over Paris then.  Actually, you could get a ring or something like it's an object.  And sure enough, he, he said I'd like--because I didn't have a phone--he said, "I'd like to have--we'll have a rendezvous in a cafe of your choice."  So here he comes, and I looked, and you know, he was younger than I thought.  I said, "You're younger than I thought," and he said, "You're not as black as I thought."  And so, I said, "Well, by the way, why did you say, say that," because I wasn't there.  He said, "Because the, the curator kept saying, you know, maybe a thousand times he's black, he's black, he's black."  Because let me just footnote in Paris.  There was someone--one time the Americans wanted to know how many blacks were in Paris.  So they, obviously they couldn't--you know, they went to the French wherever it was.  They say we only put nationality down.  We don't put race, right.  That's, that's where France is way ahead of us.
Story_ID: 317062
Speaker 1: Anyway, then the guy [Michel Conil-LaCoste], he did--I want to tell you what, again, how the same words are a plus now, because then he got me a show in a prestigious gallery, Raymond Creuze [Galerie Raymond Creuze, Paris, France].  It went real well, right.  Other words, here's this, my first show, right, sold three paintings.  And, and then I'm with that gallery.  And then I, then I realize it's the--and I had to tell this recently at a lecture somewhere, because I had to lead up to it.  I said, I said you, do you realize that in 1952, the word, if you were reading French, and it said noir, you wouldn't say black to American.  You'd say negro, so you'd know what he's talking about, because that would have been an insult to the American back then to be, be called black maybe.  You know, no one--but that is the word.  Noir is black, right.  And so I'm with a lot of--out in Long Island [New York] there was a lot of people, I know a lot of more Jews and whatnot.  And that's cool with me.  I, I like--they're some of the smartest people on earth.  I said--I think they were gonna say, ah, he's sensitive.  I said how many of you would like Nick Sandy [ph.] in The New York Times to say Jew a great talent?  They knew what I meant, right.  You don't get into that, right.  And so, but then, now, I had another show at the Studio Museum [Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, New York].  And our solo show, we start out Noir Le Grand Talent.  Now the black sounds great, right (laughter), you know.  It's just maybe it's all in the mind.  But now you use it.  But the point is you have to go back and realize at that time you wouldn't use it.  It shouldn't matter, but it did matter.  A lot of people would not want it to be and make the reference to the race when it's, when it's your race.  It could be Mexican or anything else.  But, so that, that, that changed my life because he put me on the map, you know.
Speaker 2: So after that, in 1955, you won a, a big, won an award because of that.
Speaker 1: Prix d'Othon Friesz.  They got that a little wrong.  See, even though I could--the name of the show was Prix d'Othon Friesz, and it was in the Louvre [Musee du Louvrem Paris, France], even though the Louvre are (unclear) not the main thing, the big show.  But that was the name of the show.  And, and normally--I'm telling you the truth.  I was in the show.  Name Prix d', but--(unclear)--say Prix d'Othon Friesz, say I got the Prix d'Othon Friesz.  I didn't.  But that was the name of the show, Prix d'Othon Friesz, because that's prestigious.  It was an invite show.  And I'd been in a--New York [New York] has The Times.  Let me tell you about the Times, whether you like the goddamn paper or not.  If you get reviewed in The Post [The Washington Post] and whatnot, you didn't get a review.  It, it, it ain't bad for you, right.  The Times, you know all over America on Sunday.  The rich people, the educated people are reading the fucking paper, the people with the money, the power, right, right, like that, right, you know.  But, I forgot my point we were saying before that.  A, about, yeah, so they--but, but the French don't--is not so much a powerful paper.  It's a great salons they have.  See, that, that's what, when Manet [Edouard Manet], in the last century--I mean the 19th century, he was a rich boy, talented genius and all of that.  They, they got rejected, so he and his friends, the ones that would become famous, so he rented out a spot and say Salon des Refuses, you know, the one, you know, like that, I mean, but it's salon is the big thing.  The salons were make it, and you can see that if you see paintings in the 19th [century]--you'll see walking around the critics.  And, and it's what they say, you know, that'll make or break you, you know, but not no one paper or anything.  It's more than The Times.  You know what I mean.  But, but I just put The Post and whatnot and that would not hurt you.  But you know, you in (unclear) serious.  Did you read The Post?  Yeah.
Story_ID: 317063
Speaker 1: So before we keep moving chronologically, I want you to take this moment to talk about Paris [France] collectively as an artist.  Were there other African American artists that you associated that were either writers (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --singers, dancers?
Speaker 2: And the first thing that happened when I got there, I noticed a difference, is in Paris, when the Americans are in Paris--we're talking about fifty years ago, right, fifty years--they were a little annoyed about how the French were treating that, because a lot of them it was deep down race.  They would not have wanted that, right, and like that.  And sometimes they didn't know what I was, and they would--'cause they'd say--you know, there was one, one guy over there that should be, should be in the history books.  He was vanguard artist, and he was black.  And he was sitting in the dome.
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: Kelly [ph.].  And Kelly--there was a gallery called Gallery (unclear).  He was the first to do this type of thing that they got now.  I went to see his show.  All he had was--he had a, a big swimming pool with fish in it.  Each fish had a rope attached into the ceiling, and it was doing like that, right, you know.  He did a lot of things like that, right.  But I saw this brother.  We're all sitting in the cafe.  He was like a loner.  And he's with his wife.  She looked like, she looked like she was a Quaker from, you know, white, white, you know, really, really, you know.  And he had this little baby, who I know now--he showed in June Kelly's [June Kelly Gallery, New York, New York], and these guys did like that: "Do you see what I see?" You know, like that, right.  They're seething, 'cause he had pigtails, not dreads, but pigtails.  He's a tall guy and like that.  But he was the one to break it.  We'll never know.  See, it's that--people like me to tell this things.  This, because he died, how do you get his stuff back together, right.  But I've said that, and the other people talking about, about that guy Kelly.
Story_ID: 317064
Speaker 1: But yeah, but the racism would be from the Americans. I remember the first thing they got mad with was that the waiters were called garcons.  So they'd rather say monsieur, well, garcon.  It's, it's an abstraction if you're French.  It's like Aunt Jemima pancakes or something.  You don't think anymore, you know, like that.  But they--'cause they didn't like that because that's what, what they call blacks, garcon.  So they started saying monsieur, right, like that.  But it was a lot of that, right, you know.  And then they also wondered if they didn't, if you weren't on the bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (G.I. Bill)], what were you doing over there, you know, like that.  I've seen that.  But it would be from not the French.  They got other problems, but that ain't the problem.  That's not their problem.  I've seen the French say--these ladies from World War I [WWI], they would be dressed in black.  And they would be sitting in the chair on the sidewalk.  And there'd be a jet black African with a French girl, pretty French girl.  Pretty French girls say, "Whew, I heard they're good lovers."  That's the French attitude (laughter), right.  I mean, not they don't all feel that way, but that's them.  See, it's different with them.  You see, and, and they, and the Frenchmen, you see, his, he's not--he, he believes, the Frenchmen (unclear) he believes he's the greatest lover, so he don't have a problem too much.  But most men have fear of the blacks, even if it's a myth.  But not--they think they're greatest lovers in the world.  And Ollie [ph.] said they're not, but they think they do, so they don't get upset.  In Germany they kick your ass, see, if they (laughter).
Story_ID: 317065
Speaker 1: What are some of the other artists that you were working with at the time in Paris [France] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, there were only a few black ones.  And one was--
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: --Beauford Delaney, who I asked you about.
Speaker 1: Beauford Delaney.
Speaker 2: Yeah, wait a moment, a guy named Richard Bogusz.  See, he was from Cleveland [Ohio].  And I remember him.  He would be sitting in the cafe sketching day and night.  He'd have--he'd be sketching like Modigliani [Amedeo Modigliani], you know, like that.  But he was out of money, right, and he just didn't want to go home.  And he was getting so bad that the Americans, they--it's not their country.  They can't send him home.  But they sent The Salvation Army over to him.  And they, what they do is they'll send--give you some clothes and send you home, get you a passport.  And you won't get another passport 'til you pay, right.  So he eventually went.  But I remember him.  He was like, he was starving.  I could tell, right.  All he'd talk about is food.  He'd say, "They don't have jelly donuts here, but I think about that," you know, like that; so he'd make a reference to food, right.  I'd say yeah.  Also he liked young girls too much too.  I could tell that, right.  You know, he'd say, "God, man."  So I'd, I'd lead him on, right.  I'd say, "I don't know, man," I said, "That girl look like she's nine," you know.  I say yeah, she--you know, but anyway, that, that don't make him a bad person.  That's his nature.  And he didn't get in trouble anyway.  But he was like, he couldn't go home straight because he owed money to everybody.  He'd have to go around the blocks and whatnot, right, like that.  There was a concierge--he hadn't paid the rent.  Like, that happens to everybody sometimes.  You know, first thing you know, you haven't paid the rent; you get behind.  And one time she came in and surprised him, right.  He said, this night he went, he said, (speaking French) "(Unclear)-moi," whether he say, you know, (speaking French) "Asseyez-vous," (laughter)--she--to explain.  But he was--she--I did a drawing of him.  And he was there, right, and he was staying in a place called Cite Fougeres [Paris, France].  It was a big community at the turn of the century where people like Soutine [Chaim Soutine] and other people lived.  Now, that's him.  Now, there's a guy named Sylvester Britton from Chicago [Illinois].  I went to Art Institute [School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  He showed up, and he wasn't on the G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944].  But I mean it was hard to find then, yeah.  Haywood "Bill" Rivers, that's a guy they thought I was him.  When I got there he had just gone down to Spain.  So it was only about four. But the other thing is, you see, the white artists for the first time--some of them--I don't--not New York [New York] was (unclear) anyone.  But for the first time they find out that, that they're enjoying the companionship in that context, right, you know.  They're bragging: come to lunch and come over.  And I could tell the people had never--
Story_ID: 317066
Speaker 1: You know, a lot of those guys were making it over there because their wives were working for the embassy, you know, or nobody was hardly making any money, and that's the other thing.  I saw a lot of women who was probably more talented than their husband, but they would let the husband be.  You know what I mean?  They'd be sitting down there all day long, right, you know, and then, then okay, so that's one way to do it.  But I've never had--never went--that never happened to me.  I could never do that.  And in my life, here to tell you about that, and I'm no saint, but I've had all of that almost happen.  I had--this, this woman was a very--this is a classic story. A very rich woman and she was over in the art school somewhere.  And then she saw my studio, and she said that like, maybe you--we could work, so I'll give you money, and I, I won't but you but maybe once a week or something like that.  So that was cool.  And I'm making it.  And I'm (unclear).  And so she invited me to her house once, apartment.  And her husband's an invalid, American, but rich.  And then, you know, I even had a--my girlfriend would come with me.  And then one time she started giving me--I could see she's trying to get--this is okay anyway.  She gave me--you know, I don't know much about music, see.  But it was Bela Bartok, strings, percussion or something.  I never heard about it, you know.  And I said wow, you know.  And the next day--the next week she came with a record, two weeks later with a record player, right.  And now I could tell, right, she's like, she was, she was really--and this ain't wrong.  There's nothing wrong with this.  This is human.  She got an invalid.  I'm not even making fun of it.  And I would have been all over her if she had looked a certain way.  She had little short legs and whatnot, right.  And one time she said--she came over and she says "I, I don't feel like painting.  Let's go out to do landscapes and brought (unclear) along."  She--convertible--I saw all these guys sitting there.  They said they mean, "Ed [HistoryMaker Edward Clark] when you gonna do that?"  That means some brothers that who are not artists.  They're just hanging out.  "(Unclear) let me," but she wouldn't have gone with them.  I mean, just, it's certain types she wanted.  So we went out, and we came back, and all of a sudden too--you got remember when this is.  It's '54 [1954] or something.  Her dress, as she's driving, is right up to her panties.  And then her voice even changed like, "I like sex and plenty of it."  I'm sorry, but I, I have, I have been all over her in a minute.  It wasn't about Ed Clark, but I couldn't and all that, you know, but some men can.  Some men--you know, and I found out I've known a lot of gigolos.  Some of--they--and, and in fact, one guy told me that some older lady was bugging him at an opening, and he kept--this is not Paris [France], but this here--he kept ignoring her, and someone said that woman is worth so much, he say he got an erection.  Now I didn't, I never knew if that was possible, see, but he told me and he's not ashamed of that.  But I've heard there are women, if you put a mink coat on them, they'll be wet for some old limp dick man, right.  But, but, but I'd never heard of that, right, but I couldn't.  There's nothing like--you know, 'til you thinking--you know, I mean I just, you know.  She dropped me off, and I never saw her after that night, you know, and that was it, because it was a total rejection, you know.  And I always talk about sex anyway.  But when she said, "I like sex and plenty of it," she's going out, going out of her mind, right.  And they say, "You crazy.  You sitting over in Paris, a woman's got her--she's, she's got an invalid husband; she's got a convertible, you know, right there, you got it made," right, you know, you know.  Anyway, and that's Paris, you know, or that's anywhere, that, you know, like that.  But I never could, even when I was like broke.  I've been married four times.  No wife ever supported me, and I didn't have no money.  But they all knew that I must have something special.  They didn't get into it.  They didn't holler.  It broke up eventually, mostly 'cause I'm looking at the next wife to be.
Story_ID: 317067
Speaker 1: But you know, and some men that's all they think about, right, is to get a woman, you know.  And I've seen that, you know, and that's some sick shit.  I remember this one guy here, he's famous.  I have to think of his name.  He was married to this woman.  They had a little townhouse right around here.  What's his name?  And he's, and he's black.  He was her chauffeur.  And I used to work in an art gallery one time, right, just temp- temporarily fifty years ago.  He, he couldn't look at nobody.  I could see that, right; I mean because she was homely, and he's average, but, you know, he was like that, right, you know, everything.  But anyway, it, it, it was a lot of, a lot of that in Paris [France].  See, some of the best pimps and gigolos I've ever seen have over there, right, you know.  I remember once--and this is, this guy Gentry [Herbert Gentry] you don't seem to know--there was a girl, beautiful girl, I mean beautiful.  She's like even on the blond side, the classic side, thin, looked like Leslie Caron with blond hair or something.  But she, she used to sit next to me.  But I knew it wasn't me.  She just wanted to know if this guy, she just wanted to know that he would come by, because he was, he was, had been in the movie star.  He had been in the Joe Louis story.  He's younger than Joe Louis, very handsome guy.  He lived there, and he was like--and I'd wonder why would she even wait for this guy, you know.  She was like--her, her father was a, was to eventually get a Nobel Prize, and she was brilliant.  They say, you know, we didn't get into that kind of thing.  I said why?  Why would she?  I mean, the guy isn't--doesn't care.  He, he didn't--wasn't rude to her, but you know, you know it.  And Gentry say, "Because he's making her feel like she never felt in his life."  See, some people forget.  If he hits the clitoris a certain way, all this is part of life, right, and that's the zenith, you will want that again, right.  It's just practical.  See, a lot of people are--they talking about the power of women.  You know what you see in Paris?  If there is a beautiful French girl, it's usually with a black guy.  They won't be with the George Bush [President George Walker Bush] type, you know.  I mean, that's the kind for money, but I mean that ain't, that ain't it.  They'll be with a Frenchman, Italian, and a black guy, right, and that (unclear) or not, but, but that's true what Gentry say, 'cause he's making--I, I hadn't thought of it that way, because if that's what happened, there's no way to get to it, ever, you know, but that, you know.
Speaker 2: So and that's sort of Paris, the essence of Paris?
Speaker 1: Well, that's probably in a way because, but Paris is a beautiful place, right, you know, they have the good food, sit down, you know, take your time, you know.  That city is something.  You'd see--I'd see when I first got there, I'd be sitting in a cafe.  I'd see a, a woman alone or a man alone.  And you kind of knowing them everything--and then all of a sudden when one or the other comes, they immediately get up and go.  Now that means they're lovers.  But also, they're not going out to the zoo.  They're not--they're going to a hotel room.  It stays sexual, and they--and she's not gonna ask him, or he's not gonna ask her to get a divorce.  I mean, that happens in France, because they know--what they say?  In seven, nine years, I don't care what kind of sex you had, there's certain boredom, you know, so it's no need to get into that, right.  Just keep it the way it is, and, and, and, and keep it sexual.
Story_ID: 317068
Speaker 1: So, having all of that surrounding you as sort of the essence of Paris [France], I guess that sort of led to you experimenting with all these different shaped canvases.  I mean, you, you said before that an area creates the sort of work you do.  What was Paris contributing to the type of work you were producing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a fertile ground.  It's, it's produced some--not now though.  It's produced some of the greatest artists the world's ever know.  And, and the modernism, the idea of making something modern, sort of started there, right, you know, like, but all those are, you know, way back, Manet [Edouard Manet], Monet [Claude Monet], just, you know, up to Picasso [Pablo Picasso], Matisse [Henri Matisse], and whatnot.  That's all right there, nowhere else, right.  We, we had the, what they call the show here.  The first time we got some modern art was a big--what did they call that?  It's maybe 1912.  You know, they never seen Cezanne [Paul Cezanne] before which turned us on.  But now we're ahead.  We, we're ahead right now, you know.  Like, it got varied, some like Pollock [Jackson Pollock] or something like that.  But, and they, but they had the attitude, you know.  They had everybody, you know.  They didn't think anything of the Americans--I mean our art.  They thought, in the Musee d'Art Moderne [Paris France], they didn't have one painting by an American.  Now you'd think they'd have one just as a subject, you know, like this is from over there.  And then when they had a show--'cause America is a rich country.  They forced--they had a show at the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] that this guy Sweeney [James Johnson Sweeney] curated the first time.  And there's Pollock and all of them, who was, could become very famous, and they had a paper called Art Spectacle [ph.], comes out on Wednesday.  When it came out, they had more of us--they didn't have Grandma Moses, but it was almost like that.  They just ignored the others.  That helped me too, see, because there they go, you know.  I was often ignored in some things, and I know I was ahead of everybody.  But they get into that type of thing, you see.
Speaker 1: What about the shaped canvas work?  I mean--
Speaker 2: The shape, the shape, the shaped canvas, in, in this book, by the way, I'm the one who said I never said that story, but I did start, but, but in this sense.  First of all, I never said it.  But I'm smart enough to know that I said how can I say that?  Maybe someone at Ohio State Fair 1882, you may find something that did it.  I mean, I say but that's not the point.  The point is who influenced, see.  So it kind of--(unclear)--on the 10th Street days, you know, when the 10th Street Galleries [New York, New York]--and I didn't put it--they put it right in the middle of the door.  Thousands saw it because all the--they'd have a big opening every month or so.
Story_ID: 317069
Speaker 1: Let's see--let, let me just this clear.  You were in Paris [France].  You're experimenting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Well, I, I skipped to New York [New York] now--
Speaker 1: Okay, I know, but you--I just want to get us to New York.  You were in Paris.  You were experimenting with the shaped canvases.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No, I might have been--
Speaker 1: This is like '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: --and didn't know it.
Speaker 1: Okay, you didn't know it.  So you moved back to New York.
Speaker 2: Well, I was never--
Speaker 1: You were in Paris--
Speaker 2: Oh, oh yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: --studying.
Speaker 2: --I was--wait a minute.  Yeah, what I did--yeah, that's my second trip, yeah, in the '50s [1950s].  Yeah, I'd gotten--let's say, first time I'll go to Paris, you know, cold turkey 'cause I'm from Chicago [Illinois], although I had an uncle here that, that, you know, took me in a boat.  I stayed five years in Paris.  And, and all of this what I'm talking about happened, you know, even the thing about Jean Lister [ph.], was the woman, you know, who had the car.  And then, then I stayed here ten years, and I went back in '66 [1966] and stayed three a half years, you know.  And the shape painting must have been right around--
Speaker 1: Like in--
Speaker 2: --that time--
Speaker 1: Like in '56 [1956].
Speaker 2: --right in between--yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, that is when you started.
Speaker 2: And I did more than one.  And the one they got there is not the one that was, that made the--here's, here's how it had happened: the moment it was shown, nobody knew who did it.  All they know, there was something different, see, and it start influencing right away, you know.  I remember I saw Al L. [Al Loving] and didn't then realize he made the first shape painting.  And it was a shame when they would say I did it.  But, but, but he was a friend of mine.
Story_ID: 316545
Speaker 1: We're continuing to roll on tape five.
Speaker 2: I can start?
Speaker 1: You can start.
Speaker 2: Yeah, a co-op gallery--
Speaker 1: But--just to catch people up at where we are, we're talking about your shaped canvas.  You'd shown it.  You'd put it up in, in Paris [France], and it was being--in New York [New York]--
Speaker 2: Well, I put it up--
Speaker 1: --and it's been shown.
Speaker 2: First it was shown here, first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I had contacts with the Paris gallery, right.  So we decided to exchange shows, right.  He sent his, his stable, the Frenchman, Raymond Crueze, to 10th Street [10th Street Galleries, New York, New York].  And we sent 10th Street to Cruz Gallery [Galerie Raymond Crueze] in Paris.  And they mentioned my painting in there, the, in the Herald Tribune [New York Herald Tribune]. But what, you know, what I want to say about that guy?
Speaker 1: You said you--
Speaker 2: How, how, how that get--how, how that worked, they had better galleries uptown, always.  But the 10th Street was something else because the artists would, let's say, I'm in the gallery, and, but once a month I'd sit, and then another would sit, or your girlfriend or something like that would sit, and you know, or you would just pay somebody to sit.  So, they were--then, then, and then it got because the strength in numbers, it got they decided to have an opening, I don't know if it was once or night or once a month, and everybody's there, because it was something to do.  I mean, you couldn't get down the street, right.  Now, no one was making much money.  Oldenburg [Claes Oldenburg] was one of the artist then, who's, who's a millionaire now.  But it depends on the gallery, right.  I was in the gallery called Brata [Brata Gallery, New York, New York].  And, but that's really, yeah, that was like a, a shot in the arm, right.  When I came back on that first, first trip I got into, to that.  A guy named George Sugarman, a friend of mine who's dead now, wrote to me in Paris, "Come on back--come to New York, Ed [HistoryMaker Edward Clark]."  Things are happening here, right.
Speaker 1: And that's when you left Paris for the first time, to come back to New York?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well, I'd never really lived in New York.  But I had an art scene.  I never--I entered the Museum of Modern Art [New York, New York] on the way to the boat.  I stopped, visiting with my uncle but never lived, you know, here.
Speaker 1: So when you arrived in New York, you--
Speaker 2: But I, I, I was--I matured as an artist in Paris, and that could be a drawback to some people now, right, 'cause you know, I'm talking about shit everybody's yawning about.  You know, look at he's talking about all this shit, you know.  What the fuck is that shit? You know.  That's what America America, you know that, you, you, you know, and, and, and it's got something for that, right, that attitude.
Story_ID: 316546
Speaker 1: So talk to me about in 1958.  You did your first one-person show at the Brata Gallery in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Was it '58 [1958]?  Is that when it was?
Speaker 1: Yes, '57 [1957], '58 [1958].
Speaker 2: I got the invitation.  You sure?  It says it there?
Speaker 1: No.  I can check.  Is it--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --there?  Let me just see.
Speaker 2: You have to look in the (unclear).  I don't know.
Speaker 1: Let me see.
Speaker 2: They have things different ways.  Yeah, they may have--
Speaker 1: This is 1958.
Speaker 2: I think they're wrong, but I thought it was '57 [1957], but okay.  So yeah, that doesn't seem right, but okay.
Speaker 1: Or '57 [1957].
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: But you're going by what you saw, right, but that, that doesn't seem right.  Okay, so, but I got the invitation here.
Speaker 1: Okay, talk to me about how that show came about, and what did that do for your career.
Speaker 2: Well, in the co-op gallery [10th Street Galleries, New York, New York], it's like everybody has to wait their turn.  I had the first one, you know, so maybe other guys would, would have it.  But they all, all these guys had big egos and whatnot.  And what I didn't realize, you'll never have the second show, you know, because then they'll start having group shows and group shows and things like that.  But yeah, I, I became known because of that painting.
Speaker 1: What was the co-op gallery?
Speaker 2: A co-op gallery means everybody get together and chip in, and you're all the owner or the renter.  And you just, you chip, you know, say what the rent--so now it might be two thousand dollars a month or something.  And you, you know, you had one like two hundred dollars from everybody and--
Speaker 1: Who were the other people in the co-op at this--
Speaker 2: Some of them became famous.  This Al L. [Al Loving], I got his obituary right in the, right in the top of the drawer there.  He, George Sugarman--
Story_ID: 316547
Speaker 1: Talk to me about Al [Al Loving].  You, you--
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Al L.
Speaker 2: Al L., I knew him in Paris [France].  When I got to Paris, he'd already been there awhile.  And his G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] had run out, and he was getting ready to go back.  And I remember with Al, one time he asked me, he said "Look, I'm in a show; why don't you come?"  It was the same place, American Center [Paris, France], but this was not the same show I was in.  And so, we're there, and he said, "What's the best painting here?"  And I turned that one.  He said, "That's my painting," right (laughter).  Yeah, well, it turned out he, he was one of the most famous ones now that it's all gone.  He's lucky.  He--they picked him up.  He hadn't--he was like me.  He hadn't finished high school.  But they picked him up, Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].  See, in art it's different.  You can teach, you know, you can teach if you got a big name.  He didn't have a quite big name then, but he was getting a salary that everybody would get like that, you know, for a celeb on the campus, right.  Let's say, Ornette Coleman, if he was, you know, go and looking at his grades, they'd just have him.  A lot of--I mean even de Kooning [Willem de Kooning] taught.  They say he was a bad teacher, one time, a little bit.  And, but I never wanted to, but I've been that visiting artist, right, but that's just 'cause I'm lazy, right.  When people--when I'd go in, and I know all those things from Paris, right, the first day--see, I had to keep the watch like this.  I'm talking to the students, and I said--and tomorrow they want to start that day, right, you know (laughter), I'm still--I'll be here at a certain time.  Then I went on back--so, darn, you know, they were asking questions.  So I went down to some restaurant on Wabash Avenue [Chicago, Illinois]--to the drugstore, getting a nice cheeseburger or something.  And this girl tapped me: "Mr. Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark], could I ask you a few questions?"  And then I realized, why that's a hard job.  But no, but I was nice to her.  She picked my mind, and you know, and I'm smiling and whatnot, right, and whatnot, but she's suppose to.  She's in art school, right, you know.  And I said oh my God, you know.  Next thing they'll be asking me to grade papers and things like that.  But I liked those; you're in and you're out, right.  And I'd always look forward to a new school.  It might be a new partner, right, you know, dedicated to the chase (laughter).
Story_ID: 316548
Speaker 1: So your work developed over the years, and you started to use the broom, like in the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that--
Speaker 1: --in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: --now that probably started in Paris [France].  You know, in Paris, they, they got another way of doing things.  The house painters, I guess it's changing.  The whites painted did, did not necessarily have the flat brush.  They'd have a pointed brush.  And I had never seen nobody can paint like them, those, that, that, that, those artists.  And if you look at some of that stuff, it looks like it's a big enamel, look like it's, you know, an automobile.  It's not.  I mean, that, that wall might be two hundred years old, right.  They go back to it; they do--they got even secrets and whatnot.  But anyway, I wanted to--I'm not thinking about a push broom.  I'm thinking about I want a wider stroke, right, you know.  So, I'd, I'd find one anyway like that, and then that's great, but I'd like it wider.  Well, I guess you could put two brushes together and whatnot.  And so, finally, you know, I got to thinking about a push broom.  And luckily, not too many artists are doing it, because see, if, you know what a, what a paint brush can cost?  A lot of money, you know.  But you know, I mean, I could get one for this big maybe twelve or thirteen dollars, you know.  But if it was known for artists, right, that thing might be a hundred fif- I got, I got some brushes here from China up there that my wife's uncle, who's very famous, Chinese artist, it cost two hundred dollars, brush that's up on, on the, you know.  That's how much they--you, you know, that's with that ink in, for calligraphy and things like that, right, yeah.  So it was just a natural, you know.
Story_ID: 316549
Speaker 1: So talk to me about your, you, you using the push broom as a method.  And you also met Joan Mitchell, and she had a big influence on your work during that time.
Speaker 2: No, she didn't have no influence on my work.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: I didn't like her, her painting.  I like it now.  (Laughter) No, she, she--nobody--got to be kidding.  We're the same age, the same height and whatnot, like that.
Speaker 1: What about, well, what was her relationship to you?  How did you--what, what role did she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was--
Speaker 1: --play in your life.
Speaker 2: --she was a really, she, she was very, could be very nasty, but she was never, never nasty with me, never, 'cause it wouldn't have last anyway, you know, not once.  I've seen her.  I've gone out to her place in Vetheuil [France] with other people, and I was with this girl and other people.  And she said, "What's your name?"  And she said--we hadn't started up the hill yet, and she said, "Claude [ph.]."  And then all of a sudden she said, "Claude what?"  And Claude was gonna say it doesn't--she meant I'm nobody.  Why do you want to know, you know, like that.  I said oh, shit.  I had to go put my--I said, "Hey, Joan, baby," you know, and let that cool off a little bit.  No, she let me stay out there.  She was really trying to help me.  But no way her--she's a great artist, but I didn't see it then, and she didn't see mine then.  So we were--I used a studio before she did.  She needed--she was getting ready to have a show in New York [New York], and she needed someone to come out to her new property and sort of make sure no robbery--she was, she was just kidding.  She really wanted to help me, right.  And so here I am with my wife--was that my second wife?  No, my third wife, her mother.  And so we're out in Vetheuil.  It's paradise, man.  You can't believe how that looked, man.  You see the Seine River, like a snake, no road on the side of it.  That's where Monet [Claude Monet] was he was in his thirties and where his wife died, his first wife.  But I've never seen it, the place was so beautiful, just beautiful.  And so she had not--she had a house behind the big house, which used to be a game house, like pool tables and (unclear) or something like that.  And so, I started painting there.  You know, her boyfriend, his name was Jean-Paul Riopelle said, "Come on, start working."  So I worked, you know.  I did a lot of work there, and my work began to change.  Now that's where the impressionism--when you think of impressionism, you think it's France all right, which you think maybe it's south of France.  But no, the, the--it started up there in that area with him and others, right in that, in the north.  So I'm immediately, all those works are, you know, was very successful.  But it wasn't easy to show them, you know.  It's just that now people are buying all that stuff.
Story_ID: 316550
Speaker 1: So in the 1970s you received a National Endowment for the Arts [NEA] grant?
Speaker 2: I got--and that's because of an artist named, named Don Judd [Donald Judd], who was one of the great artists, see.  And I knew him before he was a sculptor.  He was a painter.  We used to live in the same building on 19th Street and Park Avenue South [New York, New York].  So he'd become so--and, and one time you couldn't apply for it.  And that's--the only time that happened to me, somebody called me on the phone to tell me whatever it was, $9,000, and out of nowhere.  And so I owe that to Don.  And then, then you could apply.  I got it the second time, the, the Master's Award [ph.] for some $30,000.  That year--what's his name?  David Hammons--I don't know if you know that name, no--he won the MacArthur [grant] once, right. Yeah, so this guy--I mean, Bearden [Romare Bearden] didn't like scholarships, although he did get the, the Guggenheim [fellowship].  I saw that.  But it helps, you know.
Story_ID: 316551
Speaker 1: What was the New York [New York] art scene like when you came back from Paris [France] for African American artists?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, the first time I came back I'm on 10th Street [at the 10th Street Galleries, New York, New York], and that was on fire.  The second time I came back, the younger black artist, they knew of me, and that was like an injection too.  It wasn't the white.  It was--I was involved with that, right.  I remember they showed me in the Whitney Annual [sic. Whitney Biennial] and all of that.  So, but it's always--this, this the capital of the art world, you know.  I mean, but the blacks were on fire.  I mean, these--I couldn't believe it.  And I was talking to Danny Johnson [Daniel LaRue Johnson], and I said, "Look, I got something from the Metropolitan [Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York]."  They want some slides.  Shit, I would have given them slides.  He said, "What about money?"  See, they were thinking--I said, I said, "What do you mean money?"  You know (laughter), I mean, just give them my slides.  They give me some back, and I'm in their, on their file.  He said, "Money," you know, like that. That's all these new guys.  They, they were like--they had another thing going.  The art wasn't that great, but they had another thing going.  But anyway, Danny Johnson, he changed my life a little bit too.
Speaker 1: How did he change your life?
Speaker 2: Well, we hung out, and he was like--he had won the Guggenheim [fellowship], and he was very, very clever, West Indian blood, really smart.  And I remember he bought--he had this whole building on Prince [Street] and, and--what's the first street next to Broadway?  West--anyway, the whole building he had.  And one time, when he was working towards getting the bank loan, they got--it was about ready to go through.  He was excited.  And all of a sudden they started backing out, and this how smart he was.  He called David Ra- he'd met David [David Rockefeller], not just him, but this is how you do it if you're gonna do it: you use a race car.  He called, he called--you can call any of these people.  You won't get there, 'cause the secretary will stop you right there.  And she said, "Who?"  "Daniel Johnson, black artist."  I mean, tell David that, right (laughter).  "Yes, yes, yes, Dan, Dan, Danny?  What, what, what, what is it?"  Right, and started telling him about there's some problem.  "I see.  What is that?"  You know, the name of that shit.  Not only did they give it to him, they gave it to him cheaper.  I mean David Rockefeller is one of the most influent- there's a book.  If David Rockefeller was president, it would be a demotion, right, you know.  He a powerful man, right, but he said, "Yeah, yes, Danny?"  (Unclear) that, you know, "I'll see," you know.  And he did it, right.  And he had this place, I mean, you know, like five floors.  This is 2500 feet technically, you know, the widest part to the longest part.  His was 5,000 feet, and he had two floors.  So he kept one.  He sold the building--I mean he sold it.  He's really smart, right.  He knows what to do like that.  So we used to hang out, right, right.  I don't see him anymore, but yeah, I miss him.  He's black, yeah.
Story_ID: 316552
Speaker 1: So at some, at some point also, in like '76 [1976], you, you went to Ohio State [The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio] as a visiting artist.  So you were in Ohio.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well that--yeah, and all those I'm invited to, not one of them.  Ohio State, let's see, who got me--that's assistant named Adrian Hard [ph.], and she was like--now that girl, if you wanted to get a grant, she should be a grant writer.  She got every grant there is.  Her art ain't all that great, but she could write the shit of a grant, all of them, right.  So she got me there, right.  And you now, it was all kinds of little intrigue and things about that, right, yeah.  She, yeah, Adrian, she called the other night, you know.  She just came from South Africa.  She's really, yeah, she's very special.
Speaker 1: So in '78 [1978] you got to back to Louisiana as a visiting artist.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's sort of going home.
Speaker 2: And there's a white artist in my--who's from Brata [Brata Gallery, New York, New York].  Nick Krushenick [Nicholas Krushenick] set it up for me.  Now I didn't know that was a race thing.  It's okay anyway.  But when I got down there--and you know, that's a mighty school, you know, Ohio State, those a mec- mana- mecca schools, you know, I mean, all of them, thirty, too many students, right.  But when I, when I got down there--this is Louisiana, right--I noticed on the faculty that's what they all do, you know.  And that's that southern hospitality.  They were sitting in the living room, and all of them were doing this, 'cause they hadn't--they were nervous.  What they wanted to ask me about--I didn't know that--is what--because the blacks were complaining they'd never had a black visiting artist, see, but I didn't know that.  And if I did know it, I still--I'm talking about like, Cezanne [Paul Cezanne], like that.  And they, they, they, they couldn't, they couldn't crack it, right, you know, like that, right.  And then they were embarrassed because where would they put me?  See, there was one little precious VIP place there, but the woman there was old-fashioned racist.  She looked like upper-crust woman, right, and she was like--anyway, they used--before they knew it, I was in there.  And she was like, I could see when I'd--you know, they'd have the--they had people from all over the world come, professors, right.  And, and I could see she was just like, like that, right, in the dinner.  She wanted to intervene to do something, old-fashioned, you know.  But she put me--she did me a favor.  She put me as far to one part of that building where I would not have to come down the grand stairway.  I didn't wanna, 'cause that way I could slip a girl up and slip them out, right (laughter), you know.  That worked out fine with me, right, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 316553
Speaker 1: So then you, you--and after that experience, you get to come back to New York [New York] and do a one-person show at the Randall Gallery [Randall Galleries], which sold out, but wasn't reviewed.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Randall, Randall got--we made a lot of money.  I got a tape on that.  He's, yeah, he's talking about yeah, we--you know, because he's on the, on the street floor.  I mean, the Randall and somebody, you gotta go back in time.  They'd buy a $5,000 painting like it's, like nothing.  They, they got that kind of money.  They don't even have to know you have a track record.  The work was, was very seductive.  I do those things.  In this, this tape I got you'll see that.  And you know, you were making money.  And then he--the only reason he closed down is because his lease ran out, and they wanted to maybe six times.  And Armani and somebody else bought out the space, so that was the end of that.  But we did well, right, you know, like that, right.  He's a brother, you know that, Larry Randall [ph.], and, and the only, maybe the most honest man in the art world.  'Cause the nature of the beast is to, is, is, is, is--did you realize this: if you got a gallery, and you see that I got that, that, that architectural drawer there, and we got one of the artist and others around, maybe got ten of mine, ten of the lay in there, we'd, we, we sell them, spordotically [ph.] or you don't.  But, let's say, you know, I'm in Paris [France] or something, and here comes someone out of the blue and buy two.  Would you let me know?  You would.  You would maybe, but not necessarily, because, but yet if this was Radio Shack, you'd go to jail, you know, because you don't think of it that way.  You know, it's like, like that, and things can really happen if you don't get right.  That's why good thing I'm with Lillie [ph.], because she, she, she takes care of that, you know.  I'm like that old-fashion now.  You know, now I get worried because people are ripping me off.  I got something, yeah, occasionally I get something they ask me if I did it, right, some other person that got it down there, you know.  I didn't even do it.  But I could make money by saying I did it (laughter), but I got--my ego's too big for that.  I don't--
Story_ID: 316554
Speaker 1: So when you--we kind of--like when you look back over your career today, what are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I'm looking forward, you know.
Speaker 1: Looking forward.
Speaker 2: You, you ever heard this one?  I know it's on tape.  The different--not, not no one in this room now--the difference between me and other men my age is they're thinking of yesterday's P-U-S-S-Y.  I'm thinking tomorrow.  And believe me that's what it's about.  They've, they've, they have given up or, or maybe being with one woman all the time, a function, and they only thinking, you know, like that.  But that's Ed Clark [HistoryMaker Edward Clark], that's right.  I mean, she's, she's twenty-nine, and she won't be thirty for next year, and she's happy, if you know what I mean.  Maybe she real lover somewhere, but that's (laughter)--I had the old fool right, you know, like that.  No she might walk in any moment, anyway.
Speaker 1: What makes you--what, what, what, what makes all of this work for your, the art?  What, what, what keeps you interested in art?  What keeps you painting?
Speaker 2: Well, it doesn't, because I'm not satisfied with any of it.  I mean, like this one, it's almost--by the way, there's a picture I'd--of me, a drawing of me, in the '50s [1950s], in Paris [France].  And you can see I kind of look gaunt, right.  You'll see that, that, that little drawing over there.  And, and also I got a reproduction of another one you can tell, 'cause I'm always trying to make, make the, the greatest picture there is, trying to.  And I seduce myself.  I believe it.  Then I get up in the middle of the night, go in the studio and look at it.  Oh, shit, it ain't there yet.  But it's still--I ain't worried about nobody else.
Story_ID: 316555
Speaker 1: So how, how do places you go to influence the work?  You've been to Martinique, Morocco, Spain--talk to me about the place and the work that, that came out of those places.
Speaker 2: How it first happened--have you heard of the artist [HistoryMaker] Jack Whitten?  Okay, he's a good friend of mine.  It first happened when I realized I had this kind of sensibility, is when I went to Crete [Grece] with, with her, with her mother.  And we were in Crete, and he's lived in a little village.  His wife--
Speaker 1: That was like 1970s?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: In Crete, is this--
Speaker 2: Crete.
Speaker 1: --early '70s [1970s], Crete?  Is, did this happen--
Speaker 2: Now what you--
Speaker 1: --in the early '70s [1970s]?  Were--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it is must have, right, yeah.  And he, yeah, and he, he's with the--she has Greek ancestry.  And I'm looking for a place to paint.  I mean this is wonderful.  This guy swims like a fish.  I remember we were on this--the room they found with me was four dollars a day, looking on the beach.  Can you imagine that?  There's none a, again like that other one, just a stone floor.  The, what they had on the roof was a big container of water, which gets hot, so everything is cool, even in the morning, right.  We got everything.  Then we'd go downstairs and we'd meet him.  And he speaks Greek too.  And we'd go into the village.  He'd go out into the ocean.  And I got work.  I can't swim for one thing, except maybe from here to that wall.  But he--and, and his wife wasn't with him.  I thought he drowned.  I'm looking out at the ocean.  I didn't see him.  I mean, for half an hour I didn't see him.  And here she comes walking in her bathing suit, and all of--here he comes out of the water, and he had a squib, you know, he, you know, had caught two or three.  He can swim, man; he can swim.  Then we take that and we walk into this little town, Gill Galini [ph.], or something it's called, and had the cafe cook it, drinking ouzo and whatnot.  You know, the sweet life is in Europe, you know that; that's really where it is.  I mean, this is an energy pill, and I'm not saying to go there.  You gotta be a little bit like, a little decadent like me, but that's where it is.  And in the south of France, oh my God, you know.  You've been to south of France? You know.  You know what has?  There was something on TV.  They have more yachts out there in San Tropez [Saint Tropez, France] than all of, all of America.  I mean, you think you got a yacht that's 100 feet long; you'll see one 600 feet long (laughter).  I mean, I knew this girl who went there, right, this sister, and she's in San Tropez.  Now, San Tropez is also a beach, but that's not where--in the middle of the town is not the beach.  It's just like a little harbor, and that's where all the action is.  All of--they got all--they got a bikini beach and got the half-naked women.  That's, that's fine.  But they've got this thing.  She saw--met this guy, and they just talking.  Well, he's hitting on her, but not, not pawing on her, right.  She didn't--he invited her, said hey, got my boat's over here.  They went to Greece.  I mean, that was his yacht.  This sister couldn't believe it.  This man was filthy rich.  She didn't--nothing happened.  Someone said she didn't play, but I mean, that's what could happen.  That would never happen here, you know.  That's, that's another thing.  You take--I remember I was telling this real pretty sister who's never been to, to Cannes [France] or those places, I said you know, if I were you--'cause she had the, one of those kind of figures.  I said, "You know what you should do?  Go in September when all the tourist are gone.  Put that bikini on, rent a room for a couple of days, and don't--don't they'll come to you.  That's right, 'cause there you're exotic, see."  I had another girl to tell me--I said why don't you go back--you, you, you, you're not making it over in Paris [France], right, 'cause--she said, "If I--when I got (unclear) the states I'm not another black girl.  Here, I'm different, right; I stand out."  So that's just practical.  But that's what they should do, and that has happened.  Do you know Bill Hudson?  He's the one who curated a show, yeah, yeah.

Speaker 1: We are rolling on tape six (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So I, so I, I took work with me to Crete [Greece], paper.  I didn't know what I'd get in, but I knew I had this in mind.  And when I got there, I didn't look out at the beach.  It has a certain look to it.  I just doing my thing, right, and rolled them up.  Maybe I did twelve or thirteen of them and got back here.  And people would come say, "Oh, where's that Crete period?"  See, they saw something, 'cause unconsciously I absorbed something, right, like this kind of colors and whatnot to Crete.  Then I realized I had that kind of sensibility, and I wanted to eventually go to Africa, right.  You know, a lot of people talk about Africa, but I did the Ife [Nigeria] period.  I went to Ife.  I mean, that wasn't easy, because see, I didn't realize in Africa, you know, you should go with a group.  Not, no one's gonna hurt you, but men like, men like women.  They ain't gonna come up to me and help me.  And a lot of them didn't think I was black.  And, and, and I've been--nowhere haven't I, had the people--just like I told you when, when they painted me, could see that.  Even when we were in Greece, in Athens, a guy said, "Hey, you remind me of me," but he knew I was, I was black.  But here I'm in Africa, and they didn't believe it, and in Cameroon and all of those places.  But I'm in, I'm Ife, and now I couldn't--everything was backfiring.  I couldn't find a place.  I thought before I went there that I'd be able to find--I'm thinking I paint out in the bush.  It doesn't work that way, because what I'm doing--and no one's gonna hurt you--what I'm doing is so different, that it would, would--they--you know, it would be that.  That, that, that don't make them inferior, naive, but I mean, I'd understand that.  You know, who's doing all this shit?  And so, and so I'm in, yeah, I'm in Africa, but that, I could not find a cheap place.  Everywhere I'd go--when I first got to Nigeria, I went to some kind of, went to--what's the biggest city?  Lagos [Nigeria].  And so I was, I went in this little cheap, almost a tent.  There was a pygmy guy who was, you know, who was--he'd say sir, you know, boom, boom, boom.  And then he asked what would I want to eat that night.  And remember, this is like a tent thing.  And then I told him how much.  He said something like twenty dollars.  Well, that's ridiculous.  See, he's running a game on the foreigner, so I said I won't do it.  He said, "Sir, you will not be able to find any place," okay.  So now I'm getting hungry after about seven o'clock and whatnot, right.  He did come back later and said that includes coffee or something, okay.  Well, he's doing what he's supposed to do.  I walked out, and I know why they got white teeth and whatnot.  I couldn't find no candy.  You know, anything could hold you over to the next day, 'cause I was gonna leave that day--none, none, you know.  And I just said what am I gonna do? right.  I'm walking, and I saw these little girls sitting, selling peanuts and oranges.  Well, I love peanuts, right.  And they'd sell, you know, like maybe ten or thirty, so I just said you just get that until I was full, right, you know, like that.  And so that got me, and I ate the orange.  I went back to my place, and I knew I had to get--I paid, I already paid the rent.  I knew I had to leave early in the morning.  And about, before daylight I heard drums right below my window--doom, doom, doom, doom, doom.  I knew this, this pygmy didn't--I didn't know--I ain't got no end to the story, but this--I got my ass out of there early in the morning, right, and I walked over to where they have the mammy wagons, right.  And that's another story in itself.
Story_ID: 317071
Speaker 1: But I'm still--when I got some going to Ife [Nigeria], that's--yeah. And you know, Ife, that's the stuff with the straight lines down there like that, classic.  When it was discovered around World War I [WWI], some German was up there and said the Greeks--that blacks didn't do it.  Some Greeks or something had come from the Renaissance to do it, you know, 'cause they, they think the black man can't do that.  Shit, that work--it grew strong enough to get me to go down.  A lot of people thought--I went all the way to see it.  They got a museum that sits about the length of this one and a little bit wider.  That's 99 percent of the known Ife bronzes.  The queen of England has one.  And they find it in the terra cottas now, and they're not giving them away.  There's a guy that sits up there with a knife as long as you are tall, right.  Now he ain't (unclear) but you know, he may not have an art background, but he knows one thing: your head's gonna go (laughter), you fuck with that shit, right.  So I'm there--so, eventually--no, I still couldn't find a place.  And, and then one time I'm walking down in Ife, and these brothers come up.  I thought they, they were gonna try to hurt me, right.  And I had a little pen knife.  I just had it open, just in case.  And, but all they wanted was conversation.  But I saw--you know, they want exchange, you know, like that, right, and they were sincere.  They mean, they ain't got nothing to do, right.  And I'll never forget, they--I still hadn't found no place.  They had me in someplace in Ife that was for VIPs, and it was good air condition, but it was draining me, you know.  So one day they told me, hey, there's a professor--there's a famous guy, Ulli Byler [sic. Ulli Beier], people know him; he's famous.  He's down there to--he even had an art movement with the Africans, right.  And this guy is a big time, right.  He's, he's died since.
Speaker 2: What's his name?
Speaker 1: U--I may have wrong--U, Ulli Beier--Byler, but people know him, people know about him.  And so I went to see him.  I made an appointment.  He used to tell me to come over.  And you should see the African sculpture he had.  Well, he lives there, right.  And after a while, I could see we began to argue.  I was arguing for the--and all this thing he corrected me, something that changed my whole concept.  I said the only thing about African sculpture--I didn't mean Ife so much--is I can't tell the personality, mean it'd be great, I mean but one almost look the other.  And what he said to me I will never forget, right.  He says, "I will assure you, if this was the time of the high Renaissance, and you were to take Africans into Rome [Italy] or Venice [Italy] or whatever, they would not know the difference between Michelangelo and the others.  The concept would be so different that they would not see it.  They're seeing--you realize what they're seeing in the western art they're seeing like the devil.  They, they made you.  I mean they, like before the, before the camera.  You're overwhelmed with that.  Your mind's not thinking."  I'm saying oh, you know, I'm distant from it, you know.  I can't see it so much, but it's so, because they write about all that shit, see.  And this, this white boy telling--he's still--I could see he wasn't gonna do nothing for me even then, so it's time to go.  And just then something happened.  He says, "Oh, by the way, there was a young chap here a couple of years ago.  You may know him, named Bill Hudson."  I said, "Bill Hudson is in my studio in New York [New York] right now."  And then they did the 19th century way, he did, see.  He wrote a letter, don't seal it, put it in an envelope, said, "Go see the chief."  There are many chiefs.  And when I--nothing else was working, right, you know, but that letter from him.  I went to see the chief.  This guy has black skin, six feet something, and cerulean blue thing.  He looked like a king, you know, the right color to have, right, in aesthetics.  He looked at that.  "What did you want?"  You know they speak English there, right.  "What you doing?  Well, we'll see what we can do for you, like that.  Well, the art school's closed now.  You want that?"  Then he put me in this place where a, a lot of the people stay.  It's got a screen.  They've got cold water.  They've got a shower, you know.  And all this is like four or five dollars a day, like that, and I was able to do the work.  But I'll never forget.
Story_ID: 317072
Speaker 1: Here's another funny story.  So I'm--and nobody bothered me.  There was no lock on the door.  The school was closed.  And I remember one time I ran out of pigment, but they'd had pigment, and I borrowed some of that, vermilion.  Then one day this African guy who I'd seen earlier came to visit me.  He knew I was about ready to leave.  And he started telling me about, you know.  Then I realized he's thinking I'm not black, that I'm white, and so he's bragging about that, "You may have this, but we got this."  And I didn't get--I said, "Yeah, we do."  He said because for--I want my, my, my wife was black, right, Hattie [ph.].  He said, "It was like this."  I said, "Yeah."  I mean, he's trying to, you know, to give me a complex.  "You may have this by technology, but we've got this, and we got this, and it's like this.  This is an African."  I said, "Yeah," (laughter).  But anyway, but then, then we got--then I did the work.  That's just--called it Ife series.  I mean, all in this book there's Ife [Nigeria] paintings, big paintings, that, that, that I, I did the smaller works and then make--the whole period was under that influence, that terra cotta, like that terrain.  When I was flying over Africa, you could look down, you know, you think the desert looks yellow, but it's a reddish color a little bit, right, you know.  So that did the Ife, the Ife series.  And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So all--go ahead.
Speaker 1: And then something else happened.  So now it's time to go--I was in Nigeria, but I had a roundtrip ticket from Cameroon back to Cameroon.  So I had to go to Cameroon to catch my plane back.  I'm finished with my work.  So now I'm going--I'm, I'm determined not to fly.  Cost as much to fly from Cameroon to, to Douala [Cameroon] to Lagos [Nigeria] as it is from Cameroon to Paris [France].  So I said but the bus is cheaper.  And they told me once don't--you can't go by bus.  They mean 'cause you're a westerner, you know.  They sure was talking the truth, man, 'cause I'm on this fucking bus, and all of a sudden, this--you know, at first I ran to the mammy wagon 'cause the empty one, that was the wrong thing to do 'cause it's not gonna move 'til it's full.  I didn't know that, right.  Some European guy and some English guy sitting next to me.  And so, you know, so in several hours we move out.  Then we're going.  Then I realize when it stopped, they didn't have not restroom.  Well, I don't care.  I'm a man.  I said suppose I was with a European woman, meaning black American.  But see, the women with those African dress, they just, they squat down.  You don't see nothing, right.  I mean on top of the thing are buzzards, right like that.  And one time we're going, and I'm feeling like the great black hunter, right.  You know, I'm there and it's getting muddy, really muddy.  And I could look across.  The roads would--with a hairpin turn, I could look across, and I saw this other--it was--someone had to tell him it was the same road.  But they just had planks across it, no guard rail, but big thick wood.  I said, "What are they gonna--," he said, "We're gonna go over it."  I said oh, shit, you know.  And finally it gets stuck.  I'm waiting for the natives to do it (laughter).  We gonna all push this mother- (laughter) if you want to get there, right, (laughter) you know.  He goes right over this thing, thick, thick wood like--no guard rails, like that, right, oh, God.
Story_ID: 317073
Speaker 1: Finally, I got into, to Camer- no, no, I got at the frontiers, they called it.  I got there, and I was told I could change my money.  You know, I had their money; I had Nigerian money, and I'm going back into Cameroon.  So I went to--you gotta--they gotta check your passport.  And the guys said at the thing, he said--I said, "Where do I change?"  He said, "You can't change your money."  I said, "What do you mean?  I mean, I got the money.  I was told I could."  He said, "You should have changed it last night."  Everybody's being nasty.  I said, I said, "Okay, look, I'll, I'll keep as souvenir."  He said, "And you won't do that either."  Now he's getting belligerent: "You won't do that either."  Now what they had up there--they, they're, they're not friendly, Cameroon and Nig- and, and Nigeria.  They, they had a rope bridge and a guy with a gun, and tell, people tell me now I could have walked across, you know.  They would not--I'm American.  That would have been a big scandal.  But I didn't chance it.  I'm just there.  And then all these ladies were there.  This is that African thing.  They're laughing: ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you know like. That's, that's one thing that'll upset you in Africa.  They, they do, they say that's how they used to do when the guys would fight a little bit, you know, like that, right.  They're just--they hate me, see.  And so finally I change--I said well, either one of those blucks--blokes will change it.  Instead of me getting sixty dollars, I got twenty dollars, you know, say like that.  So now I go across that bridge, and I get on the other--I didn't real--I'm in the bush, right.  I mean there's nothing.  There's no mammy--there's nothing there.  I said oh, my God.  And then finally--it's always something--some guy came up.  He said, "I must apologize for my friends.  I'm very sorry that what--I saw what happened back then."  This is an African.  Everybody's African here.  He says, "But if you'd like, we got a car here if you want to share the expenses."  Well, you know, of course, and it was a Volkswagen.  And this guy was like Tutu.  He sound like that, right, that kind of English.  And he was saying to me, like, "I hear in your country they got cars that you don't have to shift.  Even a woman could do that, right."  But he just meant in an innocent way, right.  And I think, but he was gonna let me--'cause he took, he took me as far as--I couldn't get all the way because he took me as far as to where the train would start.  And I think he had in mind me staying in his house.  But when he saw that I looked at every girl, you know, you know, like that, then he changed his mind.  But I'll tell you that part anyway.  But anyway, good thing I learned to drink the water, see, and that's because a friend of mine taught me that, right.  One way to drink the water is to drink the water and then build up an immunity to it, if you can.  But you shouldn't try that, but I did, and it worked every time.  In fact, some of the little boys would go up to something where it's a fountain, and they'd--a big rock and they'd suck it out, the starch, so your lips will--so, but I'm all into that.  But this a good thing, because when they would stop to go to a restaurant or something, you know, people would be very upset if you ignore them.  We walked in this place, man.  The food was nasty.  And they dipped the pitcher in the water and whatnot, but I was drinking it right, like that and things like that.  Finally, that was a real adventure.  And finally, he stops in this place.  He said, "I'm gonna put you in this hotel where the ministry goes," something like that.  Said okay.  So he told--he went up to the guy, and he said, "This is the man of the cloth."  I said, "I'm the man of the sheets," you got that shit.  And as soon as he left, this guy took me to my room, with the little raggedy suitcases.  "Do you want a woman for tonight?" you know (laughter).  That's the real world, right.  That happens everywhere.
Story_ID: 317074
Speaker 1: Talk to me about how, with that same sensibility, you were in Brazil.  What, what body of work came out of you being in Brazil?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, in Brazil, a lot of people don't know this: theirs is a mighty real, one of the great cities and one of the most beautiful cities.  But the depth of the city is up in Bahia, Salvador [Brazil].  That's still Brazil, Salvador.  And I knew I was supposed to go there, right.  This great, this famous artist, a brother, most famous Bahian, black guy--
Speaker 1: What was his name?
Speaker 2: --he knew--Emanuel La Rueszo [ph.], or something like that.  And he's rich.  He, he goes around--he was in, lived in Sao Paulo [Brazil], and he lives in Boca [Boca Raton, Florida].  He goes around like Warhol [Andy Warhol] or something and buying (unclear) or buy this and do that, you know, really, really, really a rich man.  And it was very great.  So he knew--see, I had problems with language, see.  He kind of knew--anyway, I wanted to go to Bahia anyway, but Sao Paulo looks more industrial and other sounds, you know.  So he saw I was determined, so he said to his lawyer, "I want to send my lawyer with you," because I have things--he, he just--that lawyer really--he, he just took--that was like to have somebody to make sure I didn't mess up, see, I mean I didn't get in trouble, 'cause I was going to his place.  And so he's with me, and he's definitely like a white Brazilian, this guy, right.  He loved women, man.  I'll never forget this.  We, we went--especially black women, right--we went to some beach, and it was called a black beach, right, not, not because of people, because of the water; like, you couldn't see it, and it said a goddess live in there.  And we were sitting out on the beach.  I saw a woman.  He did too, young woman.  He didn't know what to do.  He was speechless.  She went down to the water.  He didn't know what to do.  He wanted to approach her, and he said he was, but he didn't.  And he said--I remember he put it, he say, "I was a fool.  I was supposed to move like a king.  I move like a bishop.  I was supposed to go after it.  Don't go after it, right."  He was like nervous.  I never saw her.  She was a goddess.  I mean, she was dark-skinned with blue eyes, but I don't think no bullshit blue--'cause they got that in Brazil--and a body that was unbelievable.  They got some beautiful women there, right.
Story_ID: 317075
Speaker 1: So anyway, we--he [Emanuel La Rueszo (ph.)] took me around.  Then he showed me where I was gonna have my studio.  That's Emanuel's studio in Bahia [Brazil].  He had about four people working there.  They were all worried about me 'cause they thought maybe I would pull rank and say I wasn't satisfied.  I saw right way I couldn't, the way I work, I couldn't work on those floors, right.  And anyway, but they didn't know that.  And I'd go out and come back.  They were getting very funny with me, right.  And then one day--yeah, what was this?  No, one day I met a girl, and she--did you see 'Black Orpheus,' that scene?  Well, they got that shit in Brazil, you know, all this chanting and whatnot.  We went to someplace, and we're leaning through the hut--that was with her--and all of a sudden, she and her sister, they just went in a trance.  I went outside with them, and I see it's another guy, they were all going into trances.  And I'm wondering, I say, you know, what does this guy do to work, you know, (laughter) go into a trance (laughter) and all that?  Anyway, they drove me--because we went out there on a bus or something, but all that wasn't running, so they drove--her girl--her, her, her sister did.  Angelica [ph.] was the girlfriend I was about.  Her sister drove me back with her to my place.  And when I got to my place, you had to--it was a dangerous place, right, 'cause you can get, you can get fucked up in that country.  I waved to them.  They had left.  I put the key in the lock, and it wouldn't go in.  If you don't have a key in Brazil, you're in serious trouble.  Now here's where I became a racist, and you too.  It's the same thing.  I had the choice: what are you gonna do?  I had to walk.  I had to make a phone call.  I had to find--go to this girl, Angelica, who was living with her mother though.  So I walked through--to get there, you're going through some dangerous things, right.  They, they the kind of people if they see some fool with this thing on their stomach, they'd pray to God, dear God, you help me--if answered, 'cause they gonna take it, right (laughter), you know. You know, that kind of Miami [Florida] tourist.  They--you know, I had to walk through--well, there's two neighborhoods, one where everybody's black, and they're more or less not as educated as the other; and the other where they--'cause they got a little thing there, little bit yellow.  I walked through the yellow part they're all bad.  And I got, finally I got to the phone.  Then I realized I couldn't--I called her, but she spoke very bad English, and I spoke no Brazilian--Portuguese.  So finally she, finally she heard, and she said, "Oh, you, you problem.  Come to me."  Then I realized I couldn't even write the address down.  She's telling me it in Portuguese.  And they had cops around there, but this is what to show you how people are.  When I--the cop, he's looking at me, you know, like he's supposed to.  I mean, he's got his--he ain't got his gun cocked, but he's thinking about that.  When he talked on the phone, nobody could be nicer.  But he say, "I put you," and he didn't say it in English--the cab, "I'll give you money if you want."  I mean, that, that's, that's the other thing, you know, the beauty of the people.  And I took the cab and, and, went, went to her place, right.  I didn't get it that night though, but anyway.

Speaker 1: So to talk about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That was--
Speaker 1: --some of the collectors of your work, and then we will photograph the pictures.
Speaker 2: And I know some of the big, biggest in the world, right, you know that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Reginald Lewis [Reginald F. Lewis].
Speaker 2: Reginald Lewis, and the one you don't seem to know, know the guy from--I mean in my collection from--I mean American Express [American Express Company], whatever his name is, another one.  Coca-Cola [Coca-Cola Bottling Company], that's Bruce Llewellyn [J. Bruce Llewellyn] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], Tim Panes [ph.], right, and then Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell] is a advertising guy in Chicago [Illinois]--
Story_ID: 317077
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There's something magic about it, right; it's deep.  When you see the--I remember 'cause I was somewhere.  It wasn't in, in that--where was I?  It wasn't, it, it wasn't in Rio [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil], but it was Bahia [Brazil], but not, not in Salvador [Brazil].  I'll never forget, 'cause around the time of Carnival, they, they--that thing goes on for a week.  And I'll never forget the first time these people came out dancing, you know, like--but no, there were something else about it.  A lot of people can do that, but something's special about it.  In that whole country they're all into that anyway, that, that voodoo.  But when, when I--you know, you, if, if, if you go to Salvador, the nearest you can get to Africa without going to Africa is there not here.  What happened is they come--the slaves were freed maybe, you know, not that long ago, but they had a different kind of a thing, but they were still slaves.  But they, they're closer to Africa.  You know, you can just feel it.  I mean, we, we got, what our blood is, we're European thing.  I mean maybe the, the train, the thing and all of that may vroom, vroom, you know, another kind--their thing is like the drums and that other stuff like that.  I, I took my former wife, her mother, there.  We weren't married.  And we--I'll never forget because she doesn't do this.  And right--Brazilian girlfriend took us to a place where they were gonna dance in same--they came through.  And I'll never forget her.  You know, she's got a master's degree.  She just jumped down and joined the line.  She couldn't help it.  And I told her, I said Brazil--Bahia is doing its magic, and she said (nods head), you know.  It, they got some shit going there, man.  And you've got to be talking about where you can get hurt.  Angelica [ph.] would take me--she'd be like my bodyguard, right, and she'd say, "Don't, don't speak."  You know, you speak one word of English, they, they, they know that's a pay--you know, that I--they want my wallet or something.  They, they might like me.  They--that ain't the point.  And she said you know, just, just, just pretend, you know, like this.  And we--she took me one time to, she took me to the favelas, you know, outside.  I said, "I'd like to, I'd like to go up in those places and paint," 'cause I saw that in 'Black Orpheus.'  She said, "But they like you, but if you didn't make--if you didn't go down to Esteio [Brazil] on the weekends, they gonna come rob you, right, 'cause you're a rich man," right, I mean like that, right.  It, it wouldn't work.  And then she'd, she'd meet people.  I'd say who is that?  She said oh, it's something; that's a thief; he's a thief; and that's a thief, you know, but with respect, thief.  And then she wanted to change my money.  She took me to a place.  I swear this looked like one of those movies with 'Captain Blood,' I mean, all these guys.  When we walked in there, they were like tough looking and just, you know, looked like they could kill you.  But when she said something to me (unclear) translating and say, "You have a problem, you come to me, us," right.  That's that other thing, you know, like it's us will take care of you, like.  It's nothing they won't do for you.  They're beautiful people.  I remember another time I'm with her.  To give you an idea, we were eating.  We were on some island or something eating together.  This guy, he looked like a young Tyson [Mike Tyson] but maybe nineteen or so.  And he's pointing to what we didn't eat.  And he--and she said, "Well, he wants it."  And the waiter was gonna shoo him away.  I said no.  And I'll never forget what he did, right.  He came up, and he had big, like a coffee can.  He put food--I just saw it.  He didn't even look.  He just looked to sit on there and--.  He wasn't asking for money.  Look, he ain't got no way but to steal.  He's not gonna get it.  There's no education, the same thing with, when I was on the beach with, with all these--all those people could speak English.  I'm with that elite crowd, right, the Brazilians.  And this little boy, he must have been about ten or nine.  He's trying to shine shoes, and they shooed him away, and I, so, I saw him.  And you know, it's late at night.  They got a law there they're supposed to go to school.  And I, I said, "Okay, tell him to come on," okay, when they told me, you know.

Choctaw] Indian [Native American], but she's black.  I can see--what do you see?  Do you see her as a pure Indian?  No.  I'm just telling you the story that they would tell.  But no one's ever--yeah, she's, but she's probably part Indian.  She doesn't look--I'm almost glad I didn't meet her there.  She looks like she's kind of mean. So do you know what year that photograph was taken?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay, we'll move to--
Speaker 1: But you could see that dress is old time, right.  That's my, my grandmother on my father's [Edward Clark, Sr.] side.  That was her mother, the one we just showed, okay.  Her name was Betsy [ph.].  I forgot, she--when she got married again, I forgot what it was.
Speaker 2: That's my grandfather on my mother's [Merion Hutchinson Clark] side.  He was the carpenter.  And he was probably born in Covington [Louisiana] or Madisonville [Louisiana].  They're very close to each other, in Lake Pontchartrain.
Speaker 1: That's my daughter, age ten.  And the photograph is Van Der Zee, James Van Der Zee.  When he took that photograph, he had a lot of people, because of his age, over there, including Bill Cosby, and they were all dressed like in the old days, right.  So I had to go out and get this dress from Bloomingdale's, knowing at Bloomingdale's I could take it back and get my money back, you know.  And she was sweet.  She didn't cry, you know, like I want my dress.  Her name is Melanca [Melanca Clark] (unclear) and she's the apple of my eye.  You know that.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's my mother.  I think she was eighteen.  And see, at one point of her life, she was into music.  That's a violin.  But she never played when we were living together, but you know.  So there is some music in the family or she wouldn't have that violin.
Speaker 2: The next photograph beside her, that is your father?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Can you talk about him?  Just tell us his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, that's my father there.  I think there he's in his--he's a teenager or something like that.  He's a real dapper.  He dressed like that.  You'd think he's dressed like--what's the name of the dancer?
Speaker 2: Fred Astaire.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Fred Astaire, right.  I got other folders I'll show you of him, real dapper.  He was always clean, I mean, never--every, everything correct, everything.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's my daughter.  I think she finished two years ago from Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  And so that's her.
Speaker 1: What's her name?
Speaker 2: Melanca, M-E-L-A-N-C-A, yeah.
Speaker 1: What year was it taken?
Speaker 2: I think two years ago.  They must have the date on this thing.
Speaker 1: Two thousand three [2003]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Her name is--that's my wife; her name is Lillie [ph.], met her in China.  She was my guide.  We--I seduced her, and she came here.  She is not a ticket girl.  She came on her own money.  Her family has more family than my family ever had, but then I'm right in the, the depression, so I'm bragging about her, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can you say that again?
Speaker 1: She's is now a bookkeeper.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's, I was with Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] at his office building up in Harlem [New York, New York].  And I remember--here's the joke now.  I remember when he put his--I like the guy, right.  When he put his arm around and I'm standing with other guys, I said to someone, I'm gonna shoot the--as a joke, right.  And someone said, "But you can't even say that.  They got the [U.S.] Secret Service everywhere."  I said, "Look please, I'm just joking.  I love this guy, right.  He's my man," right, you know.  But now he--and with me 'cause it looks like I know him, like he's saying my man, you know, but yeah.
Speaker 1: When was it taken?
Speaker 2: Last year, the--
Speaker 1: Two thousand--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but if she walks in here, she'll tell you.  She's my memory, you know.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's, that's a photograph of me when I first came from Paris [France] the first time.  And I was sharing a loft with another, Salvatore Romano, at 27th [Street] and 6th Avenue.  They had been the last year, so they tore down that building, and they got a big--look like a thirty-story high-rise now.  All that's gone with the wind.  That was the flower district, and that's the end of it.  But that's New York [New York].
Speaker 2: What year was this taken?
Speaker 1: Progress goes on.  Huh?
Speaker 2: What year was this taken?
Speaker 1: It's there; it's there, see on it, 1957, yeah.
Story_ID: 316565
Speaker 1: This is Paris [France] up, at the upper one, 1952.  I'm sitting at the Select Cafe [Le Select, Paris, France] across, on Montparnasse, across the street from La Coupole [Paris, France].  Now Select was famous.  They say Lenin [Vladimir Lenin] or something wrote the whole Russian Revolution there one time, so the story goes.  But also, Modigliani [Amedeo Modigliani] and whatnot writes it was--he hung out there.  And that's the only one I still feel comfortable when I go back now, the Select.  But that's used to where we would all hang out on Montparnasse, yeah, that street.
Speaker 2: That below is my studio in Paris in the '50s [1950s] on a street called Rue Delambre, D-E-L-A-M-B-R-E.  I think I was nineteen, and I was living in a goodness--someone said it looked like a chicken coop.  I, I was a figurative painter then, right, horizontal one.  It was 'Bullfight [sic. 'The Bull Fighter'].'  And there's my first wife at the bottom, and then there's this still life up at top, yeah.
Speaker 1: This is my studio here [New York, New York] when I was doing the oval paintings.  You see the oval back there.  And some of those others are oval, just the line is oval.  But, this is in 1975.  And there the brooms I paint with, including the wide one.  I've even done the wider than that.  There is a limit to the size, 'cause you can't control it when it gets so big.  But I've done a lot of paintings in this, where we are right now.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is, this is a, a large painting by a collector who has more paint--he has maybe thirty paintings.  He has at least seven or eight this size, and his name is John Slimak [John H. Slimak].  He's an architect from Chicago [Illinois], all right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Sir, what, what is, what is the name of the painting?
Speaker 1: I don't, I don't know.  We'll just call it untitled, unless it's in the book with--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What's the name of this painting?
Speaker 1: I got to look at it again.  What was it, 'Red, Black, and Blue'? I think it's eighteen feet.  You see, 'cause it's--I know you think it's an oval, but it's a rectangle.  It's an oval on a rec, rectangle, the rim around it.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  I'm sorry; could you repeat that again?
Speaker 1: He put the, the painting--he's an architect, right, so he, he knew that once he, if he finished it, you couldn't get it through the doors unless you disassembled it.  So, before the room was finished, he had that in place, and then they built the room, right.  It was a wide open space, and yeah.
Speaker 2: That's, that's recent.  Well, that's maybe two years old.  That one there with the vertical one is called 'Erotica' [ph.]. Some people see it would uncon- see like a women's breast are kind of sexual, a woman, but if so, it's unconscious, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm sitting next to George Preston [George Nelson Preston].  And the one in the yellow bathing suit is my former wife.  And that other one is his girlfriend in, in Rio [Rio de Janeiro, Brazil].  He's a professor and a historian and whatnot.  Oh, I got books of his here right now, right.  He's a bon vivant.
Speaker 2: That's my daughter [Melanca Clark].  Yeah, that, that I'm working on the, the thing for Reginald Lewis's [Reginald F. Lewis] jet, a $70 million jet.  So, I had people working on this and you know, goodness.  They had to put tape that.  I used to get nervous if she'd ever--let's say if you got a Rolls Royce, and you saw a little cut, you don't want no shit, right?  Maybe a Toyota let it go, you know.  And she'd be doing this thing like that, you know.
Speaker 1: What year is that?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Let's see, wherever that jet--
Speaker 1: All right, we'll keep moving.
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966] in Paris.  This is me with Beauford Delaney in Paris.  There was a show there that someone curated called Trois Noir USA, three blacks from the USA.  I did not like that title.  I did not like the idea, but that's what it was, at the American Center in Paris.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What year?
Speaker 2: I think 1967.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, the one at the bottom I'm in, I'm in a place called Vetheuil [France], V-E-T-H-U-E-I-L [sic.], Joan Mitchell's place, and she is in some of the photos, but I'm over--I'm out in her property in there.
Speaker 2: The same thing.  I got the same shirt on, right, so once I'm inside, and I'm outside in her garden, right.
Speaker 1: Okay, no, no--yeah, me, looking up at Tom Burrell [HistoryMaker Thomas J. Burrell], the Chicago advertising guy who has like maybe twelve paintings of mine.  That was my girlfriend at the time, Louise [ph.], yeah.
