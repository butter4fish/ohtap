Speaker 1: Now I'm gonna ask you just a few little questions, and they may be People magazine-ish type questions.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's hard for me to say, I care nothing about eating, I eat 'cause I want to live, not to live to eat.  My favorite food well the category of food I like is meat.  I never think about eating unless I think about eating meat, so I guess I would say, and off the meat I like beef.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I like all the time, but I always tell people why my birthday Jesus and I were born in December.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Vacation destination?
Speaker 2: The world, I've been on every continent in the world except Australia, and I have good reason the lady talked to me like a child and I told her I wouldn't go anywhere with her.  And didn't go, I'm not a child I'm a lady, and I want to be treated like a lady and I don't except anything less than that.
Speaker 1: Your favorite phrase or saying if you have one?
Speaker 2: I never thought of that, I have so many sayings 'cause if I don't have one I make up one.  I do my daughter [Narvie Harris Griffin] will tell you that, if I don't have one I just make up one.  I can't think of a favorite, well I'll tell you one of the things I like to do and I guess it would be included in a phrase. I like to pile praise on people.  How wonderful they are or how good they are, something positive rather than something negative.  So practically any positive phrase, oh you looking good, I like your dress, or I like your hair, so any praise phrase I would say that in that category.
Story_ID: 283849
Speaker 1: Please tell us something about your mother, what was her name?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Anna Burnett Hobbs [Jordan], my mother was about five feet tall, light brown skin; she had a smile that I wished I had.  She smiled all the time, very warm, very friendly; she spent her life being a wife and a mother.  My mother was not a socialite she was either washing, ironing, she was an excellent cook; everybody liked to come to Miss Jordan's to eat.  And we never sat down to a meal that somebody wasn't there, particularly on Sunday.  At Christmastime she'd cook a week and everybody would come, particularly the pastors, revival at our church we always had the revival minister there.  I can't remember when we didn't have a garden, we had fruit trees.  She did all the work.  I never saw my father [James Jordan] do anything in the house but find fault, and I told him one day I was gone marry one day, and I would not marry anybody like him.  She did the work, she had the babies, he'd hire somebody for a while to stay there.  But I never saw him bring coal and wood in, and you see my fireplace so while I don't like fire, I mean I like it but not at my house 'cause I like thermostats.  Very warm in the neighborhood if someone was sick my mother was one of the first to be there to put some grease on them or make them some tea.  We lived near on the Westside [Atlanta, Georgia], Ash Street schools all the children that went up and down Lena Street, where were, we were reared knew Miss Jordan. One day someone made a big mistake, they broke a tulip out of her yard, and she questioned everybody, went up and down that street 'til she found the child that took her tulip, 'cause she was hurt.  She said, "Well why did you do it?"  She said, "I wanted to take it to my teacher." She said, "The next time you want to take one to your teacher, ask me."  She died in '74 [1974] nobody ever broke a flower, if a child wanted one, she you know would give it them.  Another one I can remember a man across the street from us was very, very ill and the doctor had really given him up.  And mama went over she took peach tree limbs off the peach tree she had in our backyard and put them on the bed.  And the old folks say when the crisis has passed when they die, you know they were gonna die anyway.  But when the doctor came back, he was amazed that the man outlived my mother, that's the kind of neighbor she was.  I always knew in the house where I lived that you were going to church and you were going to school.  There was never in doubt in your mind, which it didn't have to be any coercions, one thing my mother and father saw to we all went to church.  We had to go to Sunday school and we had to go BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union], I don't they have BYPU now. So there were certain rules and regulations in our house.  Oh let me take you, I went to [Booker T.] Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia]. I finished Washington High, I don't remember ever going to a football game, a basketball game.  You could come to our house by going Hunter [Street; Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive] and Ashford [ph.] that's the focal points--Lowery [Joseph E. Lowery Boulevard] now.  But you don't come home Hunter, Ashford you come up Booker Street which is right at our house when you get up to Lena Street.  I remember my senior year, another boy lived down the street from us, matter of fact when we moved in the neighborhood, he rocked us every time we went out in the street.  That was his way of getting acquainted, I learned later.  But Sam would walk home with me every day to get to his house and every day I'd wish mama would be in the house.  But she standing there with her pregnant stomach hanging over the banister and Sam is saying to me, "Your mama done swallowed a watermelon."  And I want her to be, but I didn't say it I didn't bother you, you don't do that, there are things you just don't do.  When I see my grandson going out coming in at three o'clock in the morning, it amazes me.  Christmas when a, Christmas come, they live in Norcross [Georgia], I spend the, two or three nights up there.  I don't stay long 'cause the house is a deepfreeze like in Alaska, I be freezing so I just come home where I can have it hot as I wanna.  Anyway when I went to the junior/senior prom I went with my brother; folk from Atlanta [Georgia] know where the Magnolia [Ballroom] is.  That's the dancehall that we had a long time ago over on Magnolia Street.  I also knew you had to be home, not coming home at eleven o'clock.  Mother made me a beautiful yellow organdy long dress and I've always you know been tall you should see me running from the Magnolia over on Sunset [Avenue] and Magnolia [Street] to be in the house with my brother by eleven o'clock.  It's just things that you do, you didn't have to have a lecture, I knew what they wanted.
Story_ID: 283850
Speaker 1: And as you said before I had a brother, older, I never knew him.  He died when I was too young to remember at MacVicar Hospital [Atlanta, Georgia] you young people never heard of but there was a hospital at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] campus that's where he died.  What they said leak at the heart, whatever that was, so I always say I'm the oldest, I'm the oldest to live, the oldest to live.
Speaker 2: Now what hospital was that?
Speaker 1: MacVicars (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 1: About two years ago they had, M-C-V-I-C-K-E-R-S [sic. M-A-C-V-I-C-A-R].
Speaker 2: Now was this a black hospital or was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, Spelman was black.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Run by whites who gave money from the North, Spelman has always been a black hospital for black people.  Also I knew growing up that I was either going to Spelman or Tuskegee [Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama]. I didn't want to go, I didn't know about none of them.  My father [James Jordan] I told you had a store at the corner Auburn [Avenue] and Butler [Street; Jesse Hill Jr. Drive], I start working there when I was age eleven, I have been working all of my life.  So it's time that I get some rest but I don't enjoy rest, when I rest, I'm bored.  Dr. [Matthew S.] Davage who was the president of Clark University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], I graduated from Clark University not Clark College but we say it and my degree is hanging in there on the wall, Clark University.  Then I graduated from Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Dr. Davage came that Saturday night to the store, he first started off, my father was a professional tailor.  Went to Mitchell tailor academy [Jno J. Mitchell Co. School of Garment Cutting] in New York City [New York, New York] back in the early 1900s.  So he started off dry cleaning and you know a little sewing, and later they moved to Atlanta [Georgia] he used to make the suits.  Which said the big shots had their suits made, you know now we can get them made in the store.  And in talking to him he said to Dr. Davage, "My daughter want to go to Clark."  I had no idea where Clark was and never seen it.  I want to go 'cause that's where my friends were going you know you wanna stay with your friend.  So he said, "Well why don't you let her come?"  I didn't know 'til Monday morning I could go to Clark.  I had no idea where it was, Clark you may not know it's in southward, South Atlanta where Carver, the new Carver school [New Schools at Carver, Atlanta, Georgia] is now.  Beautiful campus several years later it's in the '40s [1940s] now my brothers and sisters finished the new Clark, even my nephew has finished the new Clark, which is Clark College.  Of course you know the consolidation and how Atlanta University went from a liberal arts college to a graduate school.  So I have my master's [degree] from, from there.
Story_ID: 283851
Speaker 1: There were just certain things that happened in my family now that young people look at you, well like my grandson.  I say, "Why do y'all go out so late?"  The first time I went to a dance nine to one, yeah, I was working in DeKalb [County, Georgia], a young man, a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity] at Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia] wanted to me to the Kappa dance.  I was afraid to ask my mother [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan] could I go.  My sister much younger than me, I gave her the invitation, I stayed in the living room while she let mama read it.  And I was delighted when she saw, "Oh she can go."  And I start thinking now what I'm a do when it's after eleven o'clock?  I'm going to tell you what I did, it was at the Top Hat [Atlanta, Georgia], and eleven o'clock came around, I went and sat down.  Everybody didn't have four cars in their driveway and in their garage; I couldn't come home.  There was another girlfriend of mine that lived down the street, when we got to my house, I told them let me out the car.  'Cause I knew when I got there that mama was gonna hit me I'm sure she was going to get me.  I was crying, got to the door, she unlocked the door, and I started crying, I said, "I couldn't come home 'cause I was in the car you know with all the other people."  She said, "I understand it." I think all the dancing I missed, I was up on the first piece and I wondered why they stopped playing I loved to dance.  Don't dance anymore but I used to love to dance.  So I asked Isolene [ph.] later how did she fare?  Well she had a door key.  I never had a door key.  You know how I got a door key?  My sister [Anna Jordan] younger than me she got a door key, so she had me a key made.
Speaker 2: So your mother was the disciplinarian then?
Speaker 1: And my father [James Jordan], he was worse than she was.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was never afraid of my mother, I was afraid of my father.
Speaker 2: But she was the one who would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She the one carried out, if you asked her something and she said no, you go ask him he gone tell you no, what did your mama say?  So they were together, which parents should be together in rearing children.  Was never any doubt, we knew when we asked him, can we do stuff, what did your mother say?  Foot, wasn't no point in asking him, he wasn't gone give you no answer (laughter) and he didn't, oh no, they were together on, on (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On rearing the children?
Speaker 1: Rearing us so we came up in a home sternly discipline and personally I'm a stern disciplinarian, but I'm not as stern as she was.  An example, I went back to work when my daughter [Narvie Harris Griffin] was five weeks old, my mother took care of her.  We always were in bed by eight o'clock at night, that picture I showed him just now, we were sitting on the first set of steps on Lena Street we had two sets.  We had those near the sidewalk and then we had near the front porch where she sat.  First dark, we could sit on those steps but when it start getting dark, we had to sit up there near her.  When I have to go back some nights to work something you know in the county or anywhere, I would take my daughter back over there.  She would cry, "I don't wanna go to Big Mama."  "How come you don't wanna go over to Big Mama's?"  "Big Mama might yeah but you have to go to bed early."  So everybody in the bed by eight o'clock, I don't remember every getting in the bed during the day in my growing life, 'cause you didn't go to bed during the day.  Wasn't nothing wrong with you so you stay up 'cause you going to bed at at eight o'clock.  I married a man [Joseph L. Harris] that liked to sleep, so I learned to take nap during the day, and as I get older I take a lot of them now.  I sit up here and sleep by myself, talk out of here, I read 'til my eyes get tired.  But it was just certain things in our house that we knew to do.  My father on Sunday we were among the few blacks who I could never remember we didn't have an automobile.  Everybody hadn't had six in a driveway, and I can't remember when we didn't have a radio.  When Joe Louis was fighting we had a radio and we had earphones I think they think they new now, we had earphones a hundred years ago, I'm not quite a hundred years, but I'm cutting close.  I would hold on one ear, my brother or somebody else would hold the other, then we'd run to the front porch to let the neighbors know what was happening.  Now everybody got a radio, everybody got a TV, everybody got a cell phone, I can't stand them.  People just drive me crazy with them cell telephones.
Speaker 2: Well this was during the '30s [1930s] though right when you were talking about Joe Louis and the fight?
Speaker 1: I was talking about what?
Speaker 2: Joe Louis and the fight?
Speaker 1: When he was fighting, well it was during the time he was fighting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: But that was one of the big days the things you know the Joe Louis is fighting tonight.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And he come out and say, "I glad I win."  That's why I keep telling children that education is important.  Learn how to talk.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Y'all don't know how to dress, you ought to learn how to walk, you ought a learn how to listen.  Most of us talk when other folk are talking, I'm guilty too, other folk talking you don't learn anything when you talking, you're not listening to what I'm saying.  You're trying to think the next question to ask me, I do the same thing.  So that's part of my teaching (laughter).  Okay, does that kind of answer that for you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All right.
Story_ID: 283852
Speaker 1: Tell us also where was your mother born? Was she born in Georgia (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I told you Hephzibah [Georgia] or Gibson [Georgia] to start with I do not know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's all I ever heard her say, Hephzibah or Gibson, Anna Burnett Hobbs [Jordan], father big light skinned man and brother name John [Burnett].  That's the extent, and there was a sister that this brother Neal [ph.] would bring mama, they and I would write her.  But when she start they, a lot of people thought--I guess you can say I came up in an upper middle-class home.  Upper middle-class.  All of my father's [James Jordan] people just about were parasites on my father.
Speaker 1: Okay, even though you won't give us the year of your birth.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: So but we're talking early '20s [1920s] or around in there, 'cause you're saying it's a middle-class family and this is before the [Great] Depression and you're describing the type family that you had so a lot of people did not have a lot of blacks, did not have some of the things that your family had.
Speaker 2: But that had nothing to do what year that happened, it happened. I can remember when--I used to go to the store in the afternoons, Jew store near our house.  I remember the man's name Mr. Schaffer [ph.], when I would walk in the door he would say "Fifteen cents' worth of pork steak."  Wrap it up, mama would fix that pork steak, so that, that was, the, the era which is what you're saying of the Dep--I didn't know it was a depression.  I know don't if you read a book I read, lot of us didn't know we were poor until somebody told us.  We came that way, I remember Pet [Inc.] milk was a nickel, mama didn't have a nickel, I remember all of us had our lights turned off when my job was to put the kerosene in the lamp and to wash the chimney.  That's what I grew up with, I, I didn't know nothing else.  I had no I didn't know anything until I was about grown to buy an electric iron, my mother had a charcoal bucket.  When I was, we didn't have coal, my father used to buy five tubs of coal a--in the summer.  So we had plenty of coal in all the winter, and he would buy wood and mama made the fire.  If mama didn't get up, nobody got up, but she was always up and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She was always the first one up.
Speaker 2: I never left home without something to eat, she take that little two-eyed heater and get a boiler and put some grits or some oatmeal.  I don't care what happened, we never left home without food, I do, I don't care for cold food today.  I'm not used to cold salads and all the stuff that people eat.  While I was in the hospital, every day they brought a salad, I never touched it, I'm just not used--now I was used to fresh vegetables because we always had a garden.  So when they started salad bars, I never seen anybody eat so much salad as I see people, my son-in-law's one, boy he can eat a whole tray of it.  But he's younger, much younger, my daughter [Narvie Harris Griffin] likes salad, she always has sal- I will eat it, but if you say salad to me, I think about chicken salad (laughter).  Meat sal- I told you I like meat.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And it's what you, you know you grew up with. And I always use the Pet milk as an example; a can of Pet milk was a nickel.  I'll tell you a recipe a neighbor across the street from my mother, this was good as steak.  You can't find good red link sausage anymore, made up, same kind of stuff like a hot dog.  This lady told my mother this is not stretching what you have, so you have enough to eat.  And a lot of this is done on charcoal, but y'all know what charcoal bucket is don't you?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Same stuff you barbeque.  Mama had a charcoal bucket.  She used it to heat the irons and she later had a, a two-eyed heater that you had little things around it.  You could put the irons in it to iron.  I also could remember one thing the ironing board that my mother 'til she died was one I understand I think my father made for they ever moved to Atlanta [Georgia].  April 12, 1945 when Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] died, I was pressing an evening dress to go to the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority  Jabberwock.  Jabberwock like we now have like stunt night and all.  And I remember as I pressed that dress I used to put it on a chair and a bed you know to iron, and mama wrapped it in a sheet.  And I remember as I pressed my dress, I just cried, look like the world's come to the end, Roosevelt dead, what are we gonna do?  And of course after then we know about the, NYA [National Youth Administration] where they let students work in some of those WPA [Works Progress Administration].  The kind of things I think you mentioned that today.  But to me that was the end of the world--
Story_ID: 283853
Speaker 1: I have seen two presidents of the United States.  In 1930 something, [President] Franklin [Delano] Roosevelt came to Atlanta [Georgia], I saw him on the corner of Sunset [Avenue] and Hunter Street.  This brother I talk about all the time, start walking that day when, I went back home.  Another boy across the street had him to walk on our front porch; I can always tell him when he start walking the day the president was in Atlanta, Georgia.  And of course I have seen [President James Earl] Jimmy Carter [Jr.], I've been in his presence, I have pictures with Jimmy Carter.  First when he was governor, and of course later president of the United States.  A lot of my travel was that I have done was really under him.  A man named Wayne Smith started Georgia Partners [of the Americas] during Governor Carter's governorship, I went to Brazil then, and I forgotten somewhere else.  When Carter became president of the United States, Wayne Smith flies into Washington, D.C. and gave him an idea about international travel and it's called Friendship Force [International, Atlanta, Georgia].  It's a people to people exchange, it's still going on, sad to say, he was assistant minister [of North Avenue Presbyterian Church, Atlanta, Georgia], oh I can't recall the name now, it's at the corner of North Avenue and Peachtree [Street], across from the Fox Theatre [Atlanta, Georgia].  He ended life several years ago; he had some kind of debilitating illness.  This is how I got a lot of travel, you go cheaper. It's called Friendship Force, you sign a pledge.  You will accept people from anywhere in the world into your home, you stay in they home, their home and they stay in yours.  I remember one night (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's an interchange.
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: That's an interchange for international travel?
Speaker 1: Exchange.
Speaker 2: Exchange.
Speaker 1: That's exchange, he got us into Russia, I lived right in Red Square [Moscow, Russia], I lived there splattered with the water, they clean it every night.  I have been to, well I say on every continent in the world except Australia and I told you why.
Speaker 2: Un-huh.
Speaker 1: Every time that lady would talk to me, she talked to me like I was a child and I quote the scripture to her.  When I was a child I act like a child, I am grown and I act like a grown lady, and you and nobody else gone talk to me that way, bam and hung up the telephone, through with that.  Even you don't nag around you just get through with it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I wanted to go to Australia for two reasons; my older brother [Harvey Jordan] next to me went into the [U.S. military] service from Washington, D.C. where he was living after he finished college.  He went to AU [Atlanta University; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] for a year; he set out to make his fortune in Washington.  I had another brother [Edwin Jordan] here in Atlanta--that I was dating a young man at the same time, I was teaching in South Georgia then.  They went in like one day apart.  My brother went to Officer's Candidate School [Officer Training School] in Melbourne, Australia.  When he reported I understand during the war years there was a lot of segregation 'cause it's still a lot of it, it's top so this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now what war was this that he was?
Speaker 1: This is World War II [WWII], I don't know about another one, I wasn't, I ain't that old.  Ask me about what war, it's World War II (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, this is early wars you know.
Speaker 1: No, I said World War II, when I talk my lifetime is World War II.  I wasn't born during the Spanish American War and the rest of it.  I wanted to go for two reasons; I want to go because he went to Officer's Candidate School in the [U.S.] Air Force.  And to say I have been around the world, so I have that one gap and the reason I just told you.  To get respect you respect yourself 'cause people not gonna respect you when you don't care, and I can understand that.  But other than that--
Story_ID: 283854
Speaker 1: Well let's talk a little bit about your dad.  We've mentioned that you told us that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --he was a professional he was a tailor and where he had gone to school to receive his, his training.  What was your father's full name?
Speaker 2: James Edward Jordan.
Speaker 1: And where then was he born?
Speaker 2: Where did he work?
Speaker 1: Where was he born?
Speaker 2: Wrightsville, Georgia.
Speaker 1: He was born in Wrightsville, Georgia?  Did he share any stories with you about when he was growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father was always business; he never really played with us.  He was also a musician; he played a trumpet.  He used to play in the choir at the church, they attend, we went to church close to where we lived, I lived, I told you in the Fourth Ward I was very close to a church Liberty Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia] which is on Jackson Street.  Was, they've torn the church down when I saw that, I cried, I said sometimes we're overly--well like we do all the megachurches now.  Maybe they doing some good I hope they are, I'm not saying 'cause they small they doing any better.  But that was close, we could go to Sunday school and church, my mother [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan] and father attended a church called Mt. Olive Baptist [Church, Atlanta, Georgia], which was a long ways from where we lived.  I remember one night going to church my mother was in the audience at Wheat Street [Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] where I am not a member, and to say I knew that minister, I'm a member of Wheat Street now.  I didn't know Dr. Peter James Bryant, I since done a little book on his life.  Well anyway she sat me on the front row and I remember this tall, dark brown skinned man coming down and I know what he was doing, now, I didn't know then.  And he kept pleading for us to join the church, everybody joined but me, I've always been outspoken by the way.  It got me a lot of trouble too.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And I looked up at him and I said, "I'm not joining this church, I'm going to join Liberty."  Mama was in the back.  She said that wasn't nobody but Narvie [HistoryMaker Narvie Harris], well that's the only church I knew, I didn't know about him.  I didn't know about Liberty Church, and when like I say I learned to love that church.  That's where I got my first religious experience was at Liberty Church in Sunday school.  And in BYPU [Baptist Young People's Union] I can tell one thing I remember the music teacher did.  I remember the little song I, I one of the few blacks who have no tone, I have none, I can't sing, I can hum it, you don't know what I'm hum.  But I remember she would play for us to march in assembly and then go back.  One thing I remember about her I never seen this and I haven't seen it since.  She took a tooth out of her mouth and picked it and put it back in there, so I guess that was a crown.  That has lived with me all of my life, I never seen anybody take something out the mouth, pick the food out, put it back in the mouth.  I can see her right now--and what the tune was I told you I have no tune, that's something I remember.  Bernice King [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King] spoke for Women's Day at Wheat Street one Sunday; she's good, in a month, a week or two she spoke at Liberty.  Well I hadn't been in there since I was a child, I was just curious to see how it looked, see what I could remember you know about the church.  And I wanted to go downstairs but for some reason, 'cause that's where we had to go you know for Sunday school the younger children.  But I didn't get down there but I had a very warm feeling sitting there, because I had been in that church many times.  I remember the minister was a Reverend Ernest Hall, I can see him now, I remember he's a very handsome man.  Then I remember my mother and father's pastor Reverend Nabrit [James M. Nabrit, Jr.] he had quite a lineage of children who made real good in the educational world.  That are just some things that just stay with you, you know all of your life.  And this feeling for Liberty since then, most of you know I worked in PTA [Parent Teacher Association], I'm the last president of the Georgia Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers.  When the national met here in nineteen hundred and sixty-two [1962], I headed the state committee for entertaining the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers.  And I had a reception at Liberty Church around the corner from Liberty Church is where I started to school, it was known as Yonge Street School [Atlanta, Georgia].  The street used to be Yonge Street, it's now William Holmes Borders [Sr. Drive].  They have had a state marker there. It's no longer there.

Speaker 1: Well tell us a little bit more about your father [James Jordan] you know.  Are you (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father I told you was a businessman, one of the things that my father boasts, he never worked for anybody white.  He also boasts the fact that we never lived in a rented house, meant nothing to me, I didn't know people rented houses.  I had a house, when I was getting ready to get married and I was grown, I didn't have to get permission.  My boyfriend went to tell him we were getting married, so he came back, I said, "What did he say?"  "That's a good girl, she doesn't take any stuff and she's never lived in a rented house."  And I said, "Don't you forget it, through with that."  So we married, five months after we married we bought a house.  So I lived in a room for from January to May and we bought a house, then we bought this house, with you know got something better.
Speaker 1: And you said your father had his own business. Where was his (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My father always had his own business, I heard him say he cleaned a white man's hat, in Wrightsville, Georgia.  Wrightsville is very rural, I went through there since I've been grown and I was happy to get out and have my picture made in front of Wrightsville back, I wish I knew where it was.  See I've heard of Wrightsville when I was there, I was very small; I had no idea you know what it was like.  I remember when this brother that I never knew died, we went on a train to the funeral y'all so young you don't know.  But long time ago they used to have these I think I called them like a wagon, like they put the casket.  'Cause I remember looking out the train and seeing this white casket that my brother that I told you I never, never knew.  I just know there was a brother before me, his name was James [Jordan], and then of course I came on the scene, and I'm Narvie Mozelle Jordan.  And I told the lady who took care of my grandfather 'til he passed told me, your name not Jordan, said y'all moved to Atlanta [Georgia] and got proper, so I guess we proper.  But since I'm talking about name, I remember my grandfather used to visit us in the summertime or at different times during the year.
Speaker 1: And this is your father's father?
Speaker 2: My father, anybody I'm talking about I know nothing, I'm gone say it again about my mother's [Anna Burnett Hobs Jordan] people, I never seen any of them I never talked to any of them other those people I talk to in Augusta [Georgia].  My father also, my grandfather, once a year sent us a hog or a pig and my mother butchered him.  She'd make sausage and hams and shoulders and that's, my mother just did everything.  I, she just, I guess he had to do it so she just you know just did it.
Speaker 1: She would actually; she actually killed the hog herself?
Speaker 2: She cut him up, ground sausage, she made souse meat, I still souse meat that she made.  We used to go to the [Sweet Auburn] Curb Market in Atlanta here to get souse meat, but it never taste like my mother's.  My sister [Anna Jordan] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And what is souse meat?
Speaker 2: Souse meat I think is where they take feet, I've never made any.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they my sister learned to, my sister liked to cook, she's more like my mother in the kitchen.  When I got married, I didn't know how to cook.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't look a canned biscuit in the face today, I fed them to my husband [Joseph L. Harris], I don't even like biscuits; I don't eat 'em.
Story_ID: 283856
Speaker 1: Anyway my sister [Anna Jordan] learned to sew, very creative, she, she's the one with the talent in the family, I had the mouth, but the sewing and the knitting and, and crocheting I told you she taught a year in England, she's been state teacher of the year.  She was presented to Queen Mother Mary [of Teck] of England; I have pictures with her in the paper.  Then one year her husband set up the science and math program in Santiago, Chile.  Their son was born in Chile, he's finished Clark [College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Then her husband set up a program, the year, after he was born in '62 [1962] in Managua, Nicaragua.  They sponsored a young man from Nicaragua at Clark College, got him a scholarship, over the holidays he share their home and out here with us.  He became a problem, he got over here and he learned about drugs, for a while he worked at Richardson [sic. Rich's, Atlanta, Georgia] the photography department.  That's what he did; his father here and his father did at home so they have had quite a number of real experiences too in their way of life.  But back to cooking I learned to cook, one day she came to see us and I said how do you make biscuits?  She stirred up some biscuits; they were delicious (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This was your mother [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan]?
Speaker 1: I never made more, I just this--my sister.
Speaker 2: Your sister.
Speaker 1: That I would, I told you use all the canned biscuits?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: My daughter [Narvie Harris Griffin] debutante's dress is a thing to behold, she her master's [degree], my sister got her master's in technical, technical subject from Columbia University in New York [New York].  She could just do it, you ever see a person with hand, she could knit you a, a sweater like that she sit up here and do it.  She said to me one day you know I never covered a pair of shoes while at Columbia University she bought soles and put shoes together.  She's covered umbrellas, her catering; I would say she had the talent.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm the bookworm.
Speaker 2: She inherited a lot of your mother's domestic skills (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We made a good team.  When my club met, we never knew what we're gone eat, but one day she fixed something when she was from somewhere they didn't it they got a little angry with 'em.  She had special steaks cut and she rolled carrots and potatoes and onions and they didn't eat it, it made her angry (laughter).  I said next time don't give them a whole one, give them a half a piece, 'cause they left it.  But she got that from my mother, my mother was not a lot of exotic food, but good food and it was always fresh food.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause we always had a garden.
Speaker 2: But you said your sister took your mother's domestic skills, she--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) She did.
Speaker 2: She learned a lot of that and you said the souse feet, the souse--
Speaker 1: Oh the souse meat--
Speaker 2: Souse meat.
Speaker 1: I really don't know but I'm gone tell you what I think they used.  I think they used pig ears and some of the feet and what they did, chopped it up.  I don't know she put Jello on it or not but it would be jellied and you slice it like you do bologna.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they sell at the [Sweet Auburn] Curb Market [Atlanta, Georgia] now you know where our Curb Market is here in Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: At the Curb Market.
Speaker 1: Well they sell it at a lot stores, it's not different (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is the same as hog headcheese?
Speaker 1: Yeah that's what some people call it--
Speaker 2: Oh okay all right.
Speaker 1: Same thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Same, so maybe they put head in there too since you said hog head, see I never made any.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: It didn't, it didn't fascinate me, it never fascinated me to go in the kitchen and cook.
Speaker 2: Right because when I was small they be at the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Used to have the--
Speaker 2: Hog, they kill the hogs at home but it was like a ritual where--
Speaker 1: It was.
Speaker 2: It was ritualistic they had the men, one man would kill him, one man would clean him, one man would scrape the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well I've seen mama wring the neck of a chicken which I could never do--
Story_ID: 283857
Speaker 1: One day a girlfriend of mine, she worked in the summer at different people's homes so she was out a week, and asked me to go work in her place.  It's the good segregated days you know that we all loved?  Well, you get on the back of the streetcar you get off the back of the streetcar, so we get out there in the white neighborhood you get off.  Well she never, they go round to the back, I ain't going no back door, and you can just have the job.  So I knocked on the door, the lady would come to the door, then we both be out on the front porch sweeping the front porch together.  She been in the back door, my daddy [James Jordan] said you don't go in a back door, you don't eat on the street, you don't get no hotdog out no back window.  So I never had it, and I never had any colored water, almost got some one morning.  When I went up to the central office one morning, they had two water fountain.  Every morning in front of the business office I don't know why I just wanted some water, so one morning I drunk me some water like I always do.  When I came up it was a sign up there said white, but you know it taste just like that other I had been drinking all the time.  So Mr. Church [ph.] tells me they gone move me and they tore the building down.  Now my office is in an undertaker, Cox Funeral Home in Decatur [County, Georgia].  They tore the building down, that's where the parking lot is now, I can tell you exactly where my office used to be.  Right there at the corner now of Trinity [Avenue] and what they call that street where [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jones whatever the street is.  Anyway I say to him one morning my conference I say you know I have personal needs.  You just don't hide it, you tell it.  I said, "They only have restrooms here for white women and they have white and colored water, I have a choice, I don't drink either."  I didn't him there's a restroom downstairs for colored only in the family and children welfare department.  He said, "Well we'll take care of that, are there other blacks on the county level?"  I said, "Yeah," the home demonstration agent her office was in the city school of Decatur and the nurse.  And the nurse told me she used to work out of the back of her car, she couldn't even go in the health department, so those are the people.  Well Scott Candler was the lone czar he had the job that Vernon Jones has and always in trouble.  I read about him this morning he's my good boy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jones?
Speaker 1: He's the CEO of DeKalb County [Georgia], you ever read, oh you not from here.  Anyway Candler was the, we used to have the lone commissioner we now have multiple commissioners; I don't want have to give you his, John Evans is our first black.  I read this morning's paper that this is the end of Jones, he's been quite a character, he's done an excellent job from what I can observe.  Leanne Levitan is our only woman that we've had as a commissioner.  The whole point I was trying to make is that's another story too about politics, I don't deal in politics.  I don't like politics I do vote, I'm registered, I encourage others to vote.  I started black boys and girls in DeKalb when they reached eighteen, I would get my social studies teachers.  We didn't have places all over as we do now, as a result getting the children to vote then the parents start voting.  And I've done a little book along politicians and so forth in DeKalb, we haven't always had you know our people into politics.  I kind of went off from what you were talking about, talking about souse meat (laughter).
Story_ID: 283858
Speaker 1: Tell me some of your earliest memories of growing up.  I know we've talked about a few of them, what, what is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories of growing up?  What kind of question is that?
Speaker 1: Well when you were growing up, what, how far back would you when you were little girl anything that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Are you trying to say what are some the things that I did?
Speaker 1: Right, some of the--
Speaker 2: 'Cause you don't know you growing up, you just grow up (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  What some of the things that you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well I can remember--
Speaker 1: When you were--
Speaker 2: Here's one thing I told you one is you going to church and you're going to school.  I can't remember when I didn't want to be a teacher; I believe God ordained me to be a teacher.  And I'm not bragging, I can teach, that's why I can't understand why so much ignorance, you see so much playing in classroom.  Make, make-believe school, wasting time with a whole lot of petty piffles that, not teaching the children good character traits.  Not teaching them by living yourself, not teaching them about their history, that's everybody.  I'm not, I'm not a racist, I believe everybody needs an opportunity and everybody should be taught.  Much of the confusion in the world is misunderstanding.  And I have been a lot I can cite my life from just simple thing is misunderstanding.  So one of the things I can remember is far back as I got I always wanted to teach.  When I die and leave here and go somewhere, hope up, but may go somewhere else, 'cause I'm not perfect.  Try to be but I'm not.  I'm gonna teach.  Just talking today, you and I today you know several times I said this say that.  I love to teach, I know everybody don't, if you don't like to teach, don't teach.  If you don't like people, don't teach.  You dealing with our future when you teach school, you either gone teach it to them or they gone live like you live.  I had a teacher; I had a lot of them ask me to recommend them.  I wouldn't recommend them, but I told them get them somebody else, they weren't teachers, they were in there playing.  Children copying all day long, I remember my daughter [Narvie Harris Griffin] she went to elementary school, we had segregation way back long time ago.  Teacher that came to them, this is in a private Catholic school.  Who used to tell them you dumber, you don't tell children they dumb, you don't tell anybody they dumb.  You don't know they may end up being president of the United States, may end up your boss.  And she'd come home and tell me but I always told her she is somebody and she is.  I'm somebody, you somebody.  Everybody has something good in them, everybody.  The worst hoodlum in the world has a good heart somewhere in him, and I believe that.  That's what I believe.
Speaker 1: And teachers should have that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You shouldn't ever tell a child he's not gonna be anybody, and people have done that to a lot, lot of children.  I've seen them do it, I've heard them in thirty-nine years in DeKalb County [Georgia] I heard, "You ain't nothing. You just like your mama."  "You just like your daddy, your daddy wasn't nothing and you--." You don't know what he may be.  And I always tell people you don't know who gonna give you that last glass of water.  That thug you talking about, he's a thug because you didn't teach him to be anything, you told him he wasn't nothing.  So he roleplayed what you told him, he acted just like that.
Story_ID: 283859
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I didn't come up in a home, I was always told I was somebody I was always told to strive, to reach beyond.  I was taught, even my father [James Jordan] working under him, I always thought he was the meanest man in the world, yelling and screaming and all.  He had not had no course in child growth and develop; he wanted the best for Narvie [HistoryMaker Narvie Harris].  He wanted the best for his family; I always knew that, he was not very warm as a person.  But we knew that in his way he cared for us.  An example, every Sunday we used to go to ride either to Candler Field--it's Hartsfield-Jackson [Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia], I remember when it was just mud out there as a child.  Then we'd go to Stone Mountain [Georgia].  I remember when that monument was not finished.  I remember when Reverend [William Holmes] Borders was asked when they dedicated the carving at Stone Mountain that what's his name, he was the Grand Dragon the Klans [Ku Klux Klan, KKK], it'll come to me in a minute.
Speaker 2: Venable--Venable [Sam Venable].
Speaker 1: I heard them debate on WSB when he told Revered Borders that he better not appear that morning on the ear of Thomas Jefferson [sic.], where they had the ceremony.  And I remember Reverend Borders saying to him, he was honored by the way yesterday by [HistoryMaker] Xernona Clayton they, she does something with your shoes.  He said that, "If God be God, and he has an ear I'm gonna sit on that ear and I'm going to pray.  You don't own that mountain, it belongs to God," and he prayed and nothing happened.  He never had an unlisted phone number; he said every night all night long they call him old this and that, that and the other.  As soon as they stated he said, "Father, forgive them they know what they do," bam they hang it back up and kept calling again.  They had something at our church one night and he told us--did you ever know Reverend Borders, or have you heard of him?
Speaker 2: Reverend Border?
Speaker 1: Borders.
Speaker 2: No, I'm not from this, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I can tell you--you don't have to talk about him.  A great religious leader, civic leader, civil rights.  He and six or seven black preachers got on and rode the front of the buses and were arrested.  They lynched black people in Monroe, Georgia not too many miles from Atlanta [Georgia], he and others took up money to get them out of there.  You know to take care of them he was a civic and a religious leader, pastor of Wheat Street [Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] over fifty years.  He was a people person, and that's the way I say teachers should be people.  If you work with human beings, you need to be in the people business.  You need to like people, if you don't like people, you not gone get through.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You're gonna have a lot, lot of problems.  So I remember my life as a child playing school and I was always the teacher.  And I tried to use a lot of the characteristics of my good teachers.  I don't remember any bad teachers, teachers who taught long time ago, didn't always have degrees.  But they had love of children, they have love of people, some of the same character traits I was taught in my home, they taught me.  My teacher, in ninth grade at [Booker T.] Washington High [School, Atlanta, Georgia] died last year, she had just turned a hundred years of age, even until death she was giving, she gave her body to Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia].  I became very close to her in the older years, very, very close.  Another thing that has pulled me toward older people, Miss Young [ph.] we were talking.
Story_ID: 283860
Speaker 1: My mother [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan] became ill in '74 [1974] and it ended when she left [Emory] Crawford Long Hospital [Emory University Hospital Midtown, Atlanta, Georgia], we had to place her in a nursing home.  That I swore by Jehoshaphat, never, I'll take a leave from my job, take my daughter's [Narvie Harris Griffin] bed down in that room, take care of her.  The same brother say, but you can't my mother never knew me from February 9th to May 19th when she died.  'Cause I ask her sometimes I go to sit with her from every day with the DeKalb [County, Georgia] to, to Austell, Georgia, every day.
Speaker 2: And what was the name of the facility you said that she was in?
Speaker 1: The one she was in was I almost forgot, I forgot now, but it was, it was  brand new by the way too.  I forgotten the name.  It's just another nursing home, but very nice.  I did for her when I had to select a place to send her, what I did when I put my daughter in nursery school, I visited them, I asked questions.  I looked what the facilities like how many people are prepared, what do they do, who does what, I ate there before she ever ate, see what the food was like.  And like I say I'd go every day, well the day she was very ill my sister [Anna Jordan] went, she called me she say, mother acting just like she did when she took sick.  My sister live closer to mama, I did all of the big things, but my sister would cook her dinner.  She lived closer so she took her diner and she was just like this I get in the car and go over there.  And she was, we put pillows under her just, just when I start off with pneumonia and ended up in a nursing home.  Again my life has been children and still is, I do love them, the Lord didn't send me but one, but he sent me a good one (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I told her you came she just arrived in the Bahamas today, she'll be back Friday, she has her own business.  She has taught school, she finished Stephens College, all-girls school in Columbia, Missouri; she has a master's [degree] from Washington U in St. Louis [Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri] where they lived for fourteen years.  Her boyfriend there from University of Missouri [Columbia, Missouri], he's in business, they both are in business.  Both of them my father [James Jordan] would be very happy 'cause none of the rest of us went into business.  I knew I was gonna be a teacher, somebody was gonna give me a job.
Story_ID: 283861
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now how many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 2: I had two sisters, one died at age five; the one I showed him the picture, and then the one Anna Pearl [Jordan] she died in '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: And you were the oldest after your, the first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not after her, before her, oldest before her.
Speaker 1: Yes, but--
Speaker 2: I was born before she was.
Speaker 1: I was talking about your brother, first there was your brother, and you were the second--
Speaker 2: I was the second child.
Speaker 1: --oldest child (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Then I had another brother after her, then I had Anna Pearl--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the last is this brother now Robert [Jordan], he retired as a social worker at Atlanta Public Schools.
Speaker 1: All right and let's start out with the names.  Okay the brother who passed and then there was you and who, what was the name of the one under you, the next child?
Speaker 2: The child okay.  James [Jordan] was my mother's [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan] first-born.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Narvie [HistoryMaker Narvie Harris], Harvey [Jordan], not twins everybody see you twins, twin name.  One named Edward [Jordan] but couple of my mother's say was courting and they called him Honey, so we still say Honey.  After Honey was Anna Pearl the sister I, my glorified sister and then Juanita [Jordan], I mean Honey, Juanita, one died at five and then Robert.  So the next to the oldest, the two are still living, five have passed when they were still young.
Speaker 1: And the one who you said was had the domestic skills like your mother what was her name?
Speaker 2: Anna Pearl.
Speaker 1: Anna Pearl, okay.
Story_ID: 283862
Speaker 1: What street did you all live on when you moved, when you were in the Fourth Ward (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) When we moved to Atlanta [Georgia]?  We lived on Lucy Street, 95 Lucy Street.  Lucy ran between Decatur Street and Jackson [Street], the street is no longer there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then we moved to the Westside, we moved to Lena Street, tell you something else.  My mother [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan] and father [James Jordan] said when we moved to Atlanta, they bought a house from a Reverend Jones.  When we moved to the Westside, they bought a house from a Reverend Jones, you ain't gone believe this.  When my husband [Joseph L. Harris] and I got married we bought a house from a Reverend Jones.
Speaker 1: Was it the same Reverend Jones?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't say that, I didn't say that; don't put words in my mouth.  I said we bought a, I didn't never say all his name 'cause I don't know them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm telling you what I was told, but I know the one we bought he used to be a, own a shoe shop on Hunter Street.  No, I don't even know first names or nothing.  But that's one of the believe it or not by Ripley, Reverend Jones.  Another Ripley I can tell you when my brothers, I told you they went in like a day apart in January '42 [1942].  They met twice during World War II [WWII], they met the bro- Honey [Edward Jordan], the one Honey was different from us.  He just never was like us he didn't even sit at the table and eat with us.  When he got out the [U.S.] Army out here at Fort Mack [Atlanta, Georgia], he came home one day and he came up the steps I said ooh when you get out the Army?  He had been at Fort Mack a whole week, he didn't even call home, he was just different from us.  When they met the first time, they were at the Sugar Bowl. I believe that's in New Orleans [Louisiana].  They both went to South Pacific, Harvey [Jordan] and I had established a password, you know you couldn't tell people when you get that APO.  I know when about when the boat left 'cause in a letter he wrote that word was in there, but you didn't tell it 'cause they could bomb the ships, you didn't tell it, you didn't do that.  I can't remember if Honey his name was Edward, my daddy's middle name.  Whether he was walking past the company where my brother was or vice versa, but they met, my brother then had been to Officer's Candidate School [Officer Training School].  So he was a lieutenant in the [U.S.] Air Force, he graduated he told me, I think he was the only black in a class of Phi Beta Kappa's.  So those are some things I can remember that since I'm grown you know when this happened.  But we had a diverse family--
Speaker 1: Let me ask you I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All except one of us has a master's degree, all of us, I told you we were going to school, you going to school, and we did good in school, okay?
Story_ID: 283863
Speaker 1: --Did Honey, the nickname Honey was there any story behind his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I told you--
Speaker 1: --having that name?
Speaker 2: --a couple courting lived in front of us--
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: --called him Honey and my father [James Jordan] said after then I never want a nickname for any of the children to have a nickname.  'Cause he even ask us, what is his name, I said his name is Edward [Jordan], your name.  Everybody called him Honey, when he died; I put in the obituary in the paper, Edward Honey Jordan.  So people know who you was talking, all his life, he was Honey, and he was different from us.  He finished [Booker T.] Washington High [School, Atlanta, Georgia], but he never went back to get his diploma.  He didn't care about going to school, all of us are bookworms.  And I told you we've have company, he come in always very polite, always neat and clean, he was one of the last one in the house take care of my mother [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan].  He only went to the hospital to see her one time; he said, "I don't wanna see mama like that," so he didn't go.  Said he didn't wanna see her, till she passed you know from the nurse, well she passed right in the hospital.  But like I say he was just different, we got florals from his friends, I didn't know them.  So I never could send them a thank you note, but I say this, they used to call them corner boys, they hung on the corner, so he hung on the corner with the corner boys.  When he died, that's the year my grandbaby was born, 1981, I went to, to New York [New York] to take care of her, but I was toiling to Atlanta [Georgia] back and forth all the time.  He was very ill, they had to amputate his leg, and one day, my husband [Joseph L. Harris] by the way worked at the VA [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] for thirty something years, where he retired.  So he came home one day and say, "You know the boys told me--" he call them my husband always call you some funny name.  My husband was real funny; he cut a fool all the time.  Said they gone take his leg off, so he said he went to the room and asked them say, "Did you sign some papers to have your leg taken off?"  "Yeah, you sure, yes, it's all right."  So when I came back he lived until I got back, he died right after I got back.  I took a picture of the baby and took it in the room he was in this big room where I guess this is where they put all people who are dying I don't know what it.  All the machines going, I asked the lady does he know all these machines are, she said no, so I took the baby picture and I got on a stool and let him, he loved children, he loved children.  But he, he didn't really understand, he died, let's see Michael [Michael Joseph Griffin] was born July 31, he died August the something.  But they had taken the leg off; they said had he lived, he had to go on dialysis you know for some reason.  But he didn't bother anybody, he didn't get in any trouble, he just like to be alone, he liked to read.  All of us came up reading, I came home where my mother and fa- I'd been reading Reader's Digest since I could walk, used to hate the Reader's Digest.  Have you read? You know and they get it out, he took all kinds of professional magazines and journals.  And I told him my father was the only licensed cinematog- he took up photography as a hobby and made a job out of it.  When he retired from the big store [Rich's, Atlanta, Georgia], ladies and men's ware and all--I start his life ten or twelve years ago, I'm gone finish it one day.  I really have all the facts down I just haven't put the icing on it.  He was known at one time top the Atlanta World [Atlanta Daily World] as one of the outstanding black businessmen.  First scholarships given at Washington High School, I think he's signal it's time to stop?  Okay, he's trying to talk to you--he gave it.  And the two students went to Clark College [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] where I wanted to go only I wanted to go because I knew people going.  I didn't know a thing about Clark, nothing about Clark.  He believed in education and because he believed, he saw that all of us got a good education.  I didn't say he educated all of us 'cause most of mine after college was scholarships and grants.  I got my master's [degree] on a grant.

Speaker 1: What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Yonge Street [School, Atlanta, Georgia] and Ashby Street [School, Atlanta, Georgia], we moved to the Westside when I was low six, we used to have low and high there in Atlanta [Georgia].  So I went to Ashby Street right near where we lived.
Speaker 1: And that's A-S-H-B-Y?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, Ashby.
Speaker 1: Was that in the Fourth Ward or was that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We on the Westside now.
Speaker 1: You're on the Westside okay.
Speaker 2: Yonge Street is Fourth Ward.  Yonge Street was later named H.R. Butler [School, Atlanta, Georgia] who was a black physician [Henry Rutherford Butler, Sr.] and the first PTA [Parent Teacher Association] for blacks in Atlanta was started by his wife, Mrs. Selena Sloan Butler at Yonge Street School.  So when you go into the history of the PTA that's where PTA started at Yonge Street School.  Miss C.B. Finley [Cora B. Finley] who was my principal was the principal at that time.
Speaker 1: Would you spell his [sic.] name C.B. Finley?
Speaker 2: C period, B period, F-I-N-L-E-Y, Finley.  And all black teachers by the way were single, I understand a black businessman had it so all the teachers nearly that taught me were not married, or they married late in life.  I thought that's the craziest thing I ever heard, they could, they had unequal salaries and then they couldn't get married.  So most of my teachers didn't have children, the one that turned a hundred she adopted children later in her life.
Speaker 1: And they just would not allow to marry at all?
Speaker 2: They were not married all of them Miss, Miss, Miss you know.  I have the directory I can show you in my, I wrote the history of my class when we had our fiftieth anniversary.  And all those ladies are Miss, and later they did get married.  I don't know what the point was, you have children you ought to be a little more sympathetic, I would think.
Speaker 1: That is interesting, okay.  And you said that it was called low six?
Speaker 2: Yeah we used to have one semester you were, you went in the low six or first, low second, whatever it was.  I didn't realize that [Booker T.] Washington High [School, Atlanta, Georgia] was a junior high school.  I still have all of our little certificates, I have a junior high school certificate from Washington High and I have a senior high.  Signed by C.L. Harper who was the first principal at Washington High.
Speaker 1: All right tell us (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I had a card today from his grandson; I told you I've been in the hospital where he worked with me.  So I got a card today hoping I was feeling better.
Speaker 1: Okay now when you were at Yonge Street were you in the first (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) First grade, second grade, third grade, fourth grade, fifth grade, low sixth and then went to Ashby Street and finished high six.  Went to Washington High in low seven.  I was placed in what they called then I didn't know then what I know now, accelerated class, they kept us together through the ninth grade.  We were promoted three times a year when other children like we do now were promoted twice a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I guess I must've been smart, you know when I say academically smart, 'cause you know we just did what we were told.  We didn't have choices like I don't even remember in high school ever having an opportunity to select what I want to take.  Mr. [C.N.] Cornell who was later principal taught physics and after we were grown I was grown we talked, he say why you never came to me?  I never had physics, I said they never sent me to you, they never sent me.  I, they gave you a schedule and you just go to class, I didn't know about cutting class 'cause everybody knew my mama [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan] and daddy [James Jordan].  So if I had cut somebody was gonna tell them.  Then where do you go when you cut class?  I didn't know nowhere to go 'cause I had never cut class.
Story_ID: 283865
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit, in elementary school when you were at Yonge Street [School, Atlanta, Georgia] first through low sixth, who were some of the teachers that influenced you, did you have a favorite teacher?
Speaker 2: I remember my third grade teacher I liked her, name was Miss Senior [ph.], first I liked her she was pretty.  And I did something on the playground one day and I didn't have no better sense and tell somebody.  I, first let me tell you about me, I was very skinny; my sister [Anna Jordan] was living now she'd said Narvie [HistoryMaker Narvie Harris] never played.  I would isolate myself from students, students are cruel.  I won't ever forget the school doctor who came once a year and dehumanize me, did other folk too, but me.  Here's what he do every year, you stand in line to go and you open your mouth for Dr. Moss [ph.].  And he look in your eyes and look in your ears and look at your teeth, and dehumanize.  "Come here little Jurdan, you little skinny Jurdan you tell your mama [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan] and daddy [James Jordan] to feed you fish heads and fish backs."  I died once every year, I meant to tell him when I got grown what he did to me.  So when children on the playground played, I would stand and lead the line in.  Well one day while standing there, two different things happened to me.  Once day I swallowed a straight pin, so I just told some of the children, I'm in Miss Senior's room, so they told Miss Senior.  And when I went in, I did, I drunk some water, she got upset made me go home, I lived around the corner.  So when I got home mama gave me a dose of castor oil, I won't forget that incident.  Another day when I'm standing in the line, I didn't play with children, 'cause they mean, they're terrible, they're horrible to you.  Skinny legs Harvey [Jordan] Narvie the charcoal twins, oh it was just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneous] All these were names, right?
Speaker 2: They were horrible, you know how they are, 'cause I did a little myself to a girl who didn't know 'til she was twelve that her mama was pregnant.  We told, she said her mama's gone have a tumor, and we said, "Honey," we also told her, "you mama is the Santa and your papa is the Claus, you put both together you got Santa Claus."  We sent her home crying so I was part of some of it too, children gone be children.
Speaker 1: And children will do that today, too, and that was back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Uh-huh, we didn't mean no harm and her brother still living she has since passed.  But these are just little incidents.
Speaker 1: Well let me ask this, what happened with the straight pin incident?
Speaker 2: Nothing, mama gave me the oil it passed, nothing happened.  When I went home she fussed at me for swallowing it, well I didn't know no better, I probably had, I would, you know I didn't have no business with it in my mouth.  I'm in the third grade, so I told somebody I said swallowed a pin, they went and told her, Narvie go home.  So I go home and I told mama, Miss Senior sent me home, I swallowed a pin.  Mama go crazy and give me a big dose of castor oil, that's the end of that story.  Dr. Moss, I never got to tell him that this is just, just dehumanized; you know, words can hurt worse than a lick.
Speaker 1: Now he was a black doctor, of course.
Speaker 2: A black doctor with segregated days, it's not '54 [1954] yet, everything for '54 [1954] you keep that in mind, I'm teaching now, was segregated, the schools--I had books with no backs on them, pages torn out of them, and other people had the too right here in Atlanta, Georgia.  Right here in Atlanta, Georgia this was no different when I to DeKalb [County, Georgia], they had you know hand-me-down books.
Speaker 1: All right so your school had the doctor to come and visit he--there was no in-nurse (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) They did it everywhere, they, I don't know if they do it now, I think they have it now you go to the health department.  But long time ago, the doctor would come once a year and do this little cursory check your teeth, your eyes you know and your ears.  And he would spend his time, I'm sure he did it to other children, but I remember what he did to me.  When I hear Dr. Moss is in the building I just starting crunching up, that old man gone tell me to eat fish heads and fish bones and tell me cod liver.  I've drunk gallons of cod liver oil, oh they would just buy it, and you didn't have the flavor.  Tell you about my child, I put her in nursery school; I let her pick the cod liver oil off the shelf.  And I would let her drink it out the bottle you know the flavor, peppermint.  She came home from nursery school one day and she say, "Cheryl [ph.] said cod liver oil is nasty."  "I wonder why she would tell you that.  Don't I let you pick that bottle off the shelf and don't I let you drink it out the bottle?"  She gave a look now that look was saying now somebody ain't telling the truth, but she still took the cod liver oil.  See when you're an only child you don't learn a lot, this girl that we told about Santa Claus was an only child for twelve years before her brother came on the scene.  And we were always informing her, 'cause you know we knew something, "Your mama is the Santa and your papa is the Claus, put them both together," girl said, "my mama, no," and she go home she was a daddy's child.  And I loved her daddy, he was so nice, but you, when you live alone it's a whole lot different when you know especially growing up (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) When you have other children, exactly.
Speaker 2: But as I said I learned since I've been grown I have all of our little certificates, I think I have all our grade cards too.  Like when we went to school the teachers you know give you a report card and bring home your mother or your father had to sign them, I guess they still do that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you have one for all of your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: You have 'em for your brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I think I have all of them.
Speaker 1: You have all of them?
Speaker 2: I'm a pack rat.
Speaker 1: Now you said Miss Senior was your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Third grade teacher.
Speaker 1: --third grade teacher. She was one--
Speaker 2: But I consider her, one of my favorite teachers-
Story_ID: 283866
Speaker 1: I remember my first grade teacher a Miss Rebecca Dixon [ph.], I remember her for two or three things.  Number one and when I work with teachers I say, "Teach 'em, stop beating them."  Every time we had handwriting I got beat on the knuckles with a ruler, and we did the Palmer Method that's when we really started with cursive writing, not manuscript as we do now.  Because eye hand coordination and I knew every day I was gone get beat on the knuckles.  So one day she punished me and made me sit with a real fat boy, a first grader sitting with a boy.  I went home and told mama [Anna Burnett Hobbs Jordan], "Miss Dixon made me sit with a big old fat boy."  I also remember someone took my red; I had a red sweater that fastened down the front.  And for two or three days that sweater was missing, that bothered me, that's in Miss Dixon's room.  But I also remember Miss Rebecca Dixon from what people say, I can't remember when I couldn't read.  She was known, they called her Bick, honey Bick you go by Bick you gone read.  I then remember in the fifth grade, that teacher also taught me music Miss Callie Shy she had me, all of us to learn the Gettysburg Address.  Children don't learn readings like that now, they don't read poems and sayings that we were taught.  She thought I was so good, she sent me to Miss Hill [ph.], all these are Miss, to recite the Gettysburg Address.   Fourscore and so many years ago and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seven years ago. Our father's--
Speaker 1: I waxed elegantly on that, I was an orator of the day.  So this is some things like highlights, I also remember that Miss Finley [Cora B. Finley], she later worked in PTA [Parent Teacher Association] also the GTA [Georgia Teachers Association].  There was a tie between me and a Mrs. [Ida] Prather who was principal in College Park [Georgia], that's Fulton County [Georgia].  So we had a tie vote and I remember Miss Finley saying I'm gonna break it for my little girl.  So I became the Region Three director here in this Atlanta [Georgia] area, so I remember her for that.  Miss Finley used to say, you all know lunchrooms today, we didn't have lunchroom, we didn't have one at [Booker T.] Washington High [School, Atlanta, Georgia].  We didn't have a gym at Washington High, when you walked the halls at Washington High you was stepping on everybody's feet.  When it rained we could not go outdoors to have P.E. [physical education].  Now if I wanted a free cinnamon bun or something like that, she used to have big trays, this lady that, Miss Brown [ph.] was her name.  If you get by there in time you could take it and you stand outside for children to come and buy 'em for a nickel.  Going back to Miss Finley, most times you know we ate at home, but some day's mama would give you a nickel and you could get a hot dog.  We go to Miss Finley's office; she put a hot dog in a bun and some mustard that was a big day.  I had a nickel that day so in Washington High when I could, we're packed in that school built for thousand.  I think we opened up with so many thousand kids, but I remember one thing teachers taught.  We respected the teachers and they respected us, we didn't have policemens, we didn't even have guidance counselors.  We got guidance counselors even in our schools in later years, and they still you know walk the hall.  They take knives, they on drugs and you know all the kind of things that are doing now, we didn't have those kind of discipline problems.
Speaker 2: Well, the teachers were the patrols then.
Speaker 1: They were.  I remember I went to state PTA convention at Spencer High [School] in Columbus, Georgia, this was new, this is since I have been grown.  When the bell sounded at Spencer High School, C.W. Duvall [ph.], principal, the teacher stood in the middle of the hall.  I never seen this, so I come back and try to inaugurate it in the DeKalb [County, Georgia], did pretty good.  So when you stand in the center, all people going this way, travel to the right, and all going this way travel the rest.  You don't have people bumping into each other, and you get to class on time.  I thought that was, I never seen that, I thought that was won.  That's the first time I saw choral singing.  Mr. Duvall I think he taught English had a big choir, all these people up, all those different voices you know, loud voice and the soft voice.  Then they come together and you direct it just like you do a choral group singing.  I remember I took that back, that's something new.  You know most places you go, you can learn something if you learn not to do it.	You know like walking when people are coming in late, chewing chewing gum, movie going and you talking you know and you go to hear it.  So when I go to, to meetings and whatever I go to, I go with an attitude to learn something.  Nine times out of ten you learn if you just learn don't, you know just not to do that.

Speaker 1: How was your school, Yonge Elementary School [Yonge Street School, Atlanta, Georgia], what did it look like? 'Cause we would like for the people who are viewing and listening to you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yonge Street was a three-story building; I remember it had moss growing all over that building.  I can remember that, also in '62 [1962] when I headed the committee for entertaining, the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers.  I had a reception there.  They organized the first unit PTA [Parent Teacher Association] at Yonge Street.  People in Atlanta [Georgia] heard about it, her purpose was the same purpose PTA is today for children.  They lived kind of like, and over that area was kind of ghetto, so Miss [Selena Sloan] Butler and Miss [Cora B.] Finley sat down, so the history goes.  And organized to see if they get clothing for the children and food, we still doing some of that.  We didn't have lunchrooms, I told you that.  We didn't have clothing rooms; we have them in the schools now, some schools.  They heard about it in Atlanta so other schools wanted this organization, from that it grew into Atlanta.  She organized what you call a council; I started the PTA council in DeKalb [County, Georgia], but not for the same reason.  When I went to DeKalb there was seventeen little shanties called schools, twelve of which were housed in churches.  When they were gone have church on Sunday, the Sunday they had church it became a church Friday afternoon, and Monday morning it go back as you know a school.
Speaker 1: Wait a minute hold on--all in that one, in those two stories?
Speaker 2: Three stories.
Speaker 1: In those three stories, first grade--
Speaker 2: Somewhere I have a picture of it I can show it to you.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I really don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay let's leave that one alone.
Speaker 2: Cause we didn't get a high school now 'til '34 [1934].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it couldn't been elementary and high, but whatever grades that's the people in that area that's where they.  See we also had other schools now, Yonge wasn't the only, but Young was near where like we do now, you go to school now where you live.
Speaker 1: All right but 'cause see what I'm looking at is Booker, Booker T. Washington [High School, Atlanta, Georgia] was the only high school, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah but it didn't come on 'til '34 [1934] that's trying to tell you.
Speaker 1: Okay but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I went to school before '34 [1934] and that people went before me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So this was an elementary school, Yonge Street was one on Yonge Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Near Decatur Street, then you had David T. Howard [School, Atlanta, Georgia], you had Crogman [School, Atlanta, Georgia], you had well other schools, all over like we still have.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right then, see that's--
Speaker 2: You just one elementary school, so when we moved then I went to school near again where I lived.  I lived near Ashby Street [School, Atlanta, Georgia], which later became known as E.R. Carter [Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They named it for Reverend [Edward Randolph] Carter, the pastor of Friendship [Baptist] Church [Atlanta, Georgia].  So it's just like it is now, you had schools scattered all over Atlanta.
Story_ID: 283868
Speaker 1: Let's do high six at Ashby [Street School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Well I had a teacher-
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, wait a minute--
Speaker 2: --I remember her name at Ashby Street her name was Mrs. A.D. Badger.  The thing that stands out with me with Miss Badger she was very fair skin again, a very good teacher.  When you went in her room you had class, you weren't playing and hop stopping and fooling around.  By the way the principal was Mrs. Beatley Smith [ph.], what I remember most about her, even though we had to take a dime to school, she bought us, they were new then, Popsicles.  And I always remember how ooh I just thought she was a wondrous teacher, greatest teacher, and I told mama she gave us a Popsicle.  I don't remember nothing else about her.  But you know no teacher ever really, we paid for it, but we got a Popsicle with her around.  With that dime that, that we took.  I remember all of my teachers were no-nonsense teachers, they taught, they didn't spend a lot of time practicing.  As one of our principals say when he went in the [U.S.] Army, men did not know the diff- the left foot from the right foot.  So they used a potato in one hand and an ear of corn in the other, so they'd say corn, sweet potato corn, sweet potato, so that's how they learned.  Our teachers taught herself us when it was time to graduate; they didn't have to spend hours teaching us left and right.  So that's how we used that with her.  What stands out in my mind, a Popsicle had chocolate on the outside and vanilla ice cream on the inside.
Speaker 1: Isn't that called a Dixie something?
Speaker 2: I don't know what they called it now.  In my day (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But what is called then?
Speaker 2: In my day they called it Popsicle.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not your day.  My day, they say Popsicle.  Things changed names a lot of them changed names and it's still you know the same thing.  But I remember the Popsicle, I don't know what they call it now, but I remember it had chocolate on the outside, it was on a stick.  And we just bit on it; I guess we had a party.  I don't know why we had a, but I remember Miss A.D. Badger for getting us a Popsicle.  I don't remember her teaching but I don't remember any teacher that didn't teach, they didn't waste time.
Story_ID: 283869
Speaker 1: Some of the things when we entered this big school where you change classes.  See in middle school now they change, even in elementary school.  Children, either the children or the teachers change.  So we enter this big building this is like another world.
Speaker 2: This was [Booker T.] Washington [High School, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: I had gotten enrolled in Washington high see, we're now going through we haven't always had twelfth grade by the way.  Georgia gradually added the twelfth graduate, used to graduate from eleventh grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I finished the twelfth grade.  My class was the--they opened in '24 [1924] and I finished in '34 [1934] which we were the tenth and according to the records we had the largest up to that time.  There were 365 of us in the class, so there was no way we could know them all.  Like our class president when we had the reunion, I didn't know her, she was a person who finished David T. Howard [School, Atlanta, Georgia] where she lived and then came to Washington High.  When Washington High opened, people came from all over the State of Georgia.  Because we didn't have high schools all over Georgia, high schools you know a new something for blacks.  I guess they had them for white.  But they came everywhere so their children could go now, but people who had some money sent 'em to Oglethorpe [Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia], which was at one time, it later became a private, public school.  Was a private school, so they had money to pay, yeah it was just regular (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For grades--?  What grades for the high school?
Speaker 1: Regular school, just like anywhere else, you just pay to go, regular school.  They had the elementary, Evelyn Ross Robinson was a principal of Oglethorpe Elementary, used to be up there on the campus Washington at Morris Brown [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  My nephew that I told you, they got permission for him to go to Oglethorpe; it was one of our better elementary schools they say.  But I just went to the regular school you know near where I lived.  If you wanted to go, I guess you do it now, if you wanna go to another school, you have to get permission from the central office.  Because they try to put you near you know where you live, lot has to do with transportation.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Where you live.  So we get to big Washington High, we're changing classes and I remember being stomped everyday they walk all on you, 'cause you had to do that to survive.  We never had an assembly 'cause we never had a gym, gyms come lately, and I remember J.Y. Sand [ph.], by the way he's in a nursing home now, and we never moved and we didn't talk and we listened.  Mr. [C.L.] Harper was ahead of his time, he would bring us great singers like Roland Hayes and we learn to sit and how to act.  He'd have speakers, under Mr. Harper we had glee clubs, Graham [W.] Jackson the famous accordionist who played 'Going Home' when [President Franklin Delano] Roosevelt died, was our teacher.  He was paid to teach me and my brother piano, I took a lot of piano, I pick, I can pick this organ.  And I remember, I told my daddy [James Jordan] he was wasting money.  We would go to Mr. Jackson's girlfriend, later married her, he never saw us.  We'd go in, the doors unlock we go in there and pick the piano and go home, and I said, "Papa it's no point of us keep going to," glad I can say I took from Graham Jackson because he came so notable.  He taught at Washington High.  Two of my classmates sold a record shows, Mary Ellen [ph.] and Eloise [ph.] who lived next door to my sister [Anna Jordan] wrote our class song.  But music the lyrics were by Graham Jackson.  And he's known, I don't know if you've seen the portrait I think it was on Look magazine Look [sic.] or Life playing the accordion with a tear, that's a famous picture of Graham W. Jackson.  A gifted musician but he didn't teach Narvie [HistoryMaker Narvie Harris] and Harvey [Jordan] anything.  So finally my daddy just stopped us from going, he wouldn't, he didn't know when we came nor when we left.  I didn't want to go anyway I said papa he don't never come in the room, so we didn't have to go anymore.  'Cause he wasn't teaching us, we go in there and take the  music book, open up the piano and big old black baby grand, but we weren't taught.  But he was a musician; I understand his sons were musically inclined too.  That's how that white house across from Washington High is now called the Little White House.  He was the musician who played for Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You never heard that story that's a fact, that's a fact.
Speaker 2: And you said that you had taken music earlier by another teacher, right?
Speaker 1: Oh took a lot of them, my first one was Florence Morrison later married Hogan, and she was a principal here in Atlanta, Georgia.  And played for the senior choir at Wheat Street [Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and I sang in her choir, she was in school at Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  That's when you walked; she said my daddy paid her a quarter a lesson.

Speaker 2: Skip through with the rest of them.  I'll eventually do it.
Speaker 1: You're just gonna let it come surprise me?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then we'll be able to tie in--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You know what Yonge Street [School, Atlanta, Georgia] was like and what year that was.
Speaker 2: Well it was not any different--when you say Yonge, say schools during that period, they were all the same.  We had the same curriculum; I later learned after I got grown I had never heard of county license.   You ever heard of a county license teacher?
Speaker 1: County license teacher?
Speaker 2: Have you ever heard a normal degree?
Speaker 1: I have heard of normal schools like the teaching schools.
Speaker 2: Well they, they got a normal degree; a normal degree meant you had two years of college.  When I went to DeKalb [County, Georgia], they kept saying county license, what is county lie, I thought everybody had A.B. Degree.  A county license teacher may be a person who may have finished high school and is still going to school.  In Georgia, we used to have what they call extended school at Morris Brown College [Atlanta, Georgia].  In the summer the state schools would have teacher preparation classes so you could finish your degree.  When I went to DeKalb, two people had master's degree: me and the new principal.  I have the stats on all this written how many had A.B. which was few.  County license or you may have had a normal degree, meant you had been to college, but you didn't have an A.B. as you and I know it.  So you had this conglomerate, but I say this, they taught, they followed directions much better than the smart one with Ph.D.s.  When they desegregated in DeKalb County, I was asked by one of the assistant associate superintendents to give him a list of my best teachers, 'cause we're integrating and I say this everywhere with, without any share about it.  We didn't integrate in DeKalb, we desegregated.  There is a difference, integration is where two or more people come together, plan together, we didn't do it in DeKalb.  Decatur [County, Georgia] did, Decatur had an integrating group and they made the decisions.  When I saw the papers from Judge Edenfield where they went to court, May 17th, '54 [1954] was the day the [U.S.] Supreme Court made the decision about the school [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954].  That particular day, the principal what later was Hamilton High [School, Scottdale, Georgia] and I was getting ready to go to what later was Victoria Simmons Elementary School [Stone Mountain, Georgia], a field.  The only school for blacks that had a phone was in Hamilton.  Mr. [William] Hatton went back and answered his phone, it was the press: "We're looking for the superintendent to get his opinion.  They just declared you know you can't have segregated school."  Well he wasn't there, and where he was, we didn't have cell telephones, and everybody own one but me.  And I don't one, I'm not gone be hanging on no phone everywhere I go I go to sleep on a phone.  I wake up on a phone and it's just, my ears can't take that much.  But the next morning, they broke ground and later was Hamilton High then it was Avondale Colored Elementary and High School [Scottdale, Georgia].  And Mr. [Jim] Cherry was very angry about the decision, and one of the things he say to us, "Tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm going to the polls and vote."  'Cause we're supposed dumb to know that we supposed to know that Supreme Court judges are appointed by--like they trying to get somebody now in O'Connor's [Justice Sandra Day O'Connor] place--by the resident of the United States.  I happen some good teacher taught me Supreme Court judges are appointed, so all they can do is you have to do something terrible to take them out of office.
Speaker 1: Okay, you know what we're gonna (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But they didn't desegregate in DeKalb until 1969.
Speaker 1: That's what I was reading from your--
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969].
Speaker 1: --from your literature from '54 [1954] to sixty--
Speaker 2: So when they say you know about slow and something in my book I have in there it was very slow to me.
