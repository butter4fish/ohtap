Speaker 1: Let's begin by talking about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And just give us what you know, you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I want to start with your father's side of the family (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  Well, my--
Speaker 1: Tell me, tell me his name--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when he was born, where he was born, if you know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, my father is Walter John Wedgeworth, Sr. [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.], and he was born in Texas, you know, Fort Worth, Texas.  He comes from a single mother [Armonia Wedgeworth Whiting].  And I don't know a lot about his father because they weren't married, and so, he grew up with my grandmother.  He came here in the early '40s [1940s] to Denver, Colorado, and, and was a laborer.  He was a civil servant and worked for the federal government, for the [U.S.] Air Force fine--Air Force here, Lowry Air Force Base [Colorado], for like thirty-four years.
Speaker 1: Did he share any stories about him growing up?
Speaker 2: Not very much.  I mean, my dad is just very private.  And as a senior--as a single child, you know, my grandmother really didn't have a lot of money, and so I, I think they struggled a lot.  And he didn't really talk about that when we were growing up as kids too much.  He, he--his life mostly started when he came here to Denver, like when he was earl- like a, a teenager.  And, but he doesn't talk about his early years at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he talk about his education?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I mean, he, he basically, you know, completed high school [Manual High School] here in Denver when they moved here, and that was the, the completion of his education, was a high school degree.
Speaker 1: Well, then tell me personally your relationship with your father.
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: How do you describe him?
Speaker 2: Well, my father--I'm the youngest of six, and so when I was growing up, I was pretty much, you know, the last kid there.  So I was always the rebellious one, you know, kind of the radical one.  And so my dad has always been very conservative and, and, but very quiet, you know, and very, you know, calm and, and reflective.  And, and he always was very protective, especially 'cause there's two girls and four boys [Timothy Wedgeworth, Danny Wedgeworth, Clifford Wedgeworth, and Walter Wedgeworth, Jr.].  And so, he was always very protective for my sister [Debra Wedgeworth  Kelly] and I, you know, and always would be concerned about who we dated and things like that, and so.
Speaker 1: What trait do you think or characteristic do you think that you got from your father?
Speaker 2: I think his quietness, you know, 'cause even though I'm, I'm a public figure, I'm a very private person in a very public life.  So, the real part of me that, you know, few people know, except my close family and friends, is that I'm, I am very quiet; you know, I'm a homebody, and, and that's basically him.  But he does have a--he does like people, and he, he does, you know, enjoy being around people, so.
Story_ID: 565125
Speaker 1: Now did you know your grandmother, his mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And she, she just recently passed away at ninety-nine years old.
Speaker 1: And tell me her name and tell me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Armonia Whiting [Armonia Wedgeworth Whiting].
Speaker 1: --about her.  I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Armonia Whiting, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and tell me about her.
Speaker 2: She was a laundress, and she worked at Fitzsimmons Army Hospital [Fitzsimons Army Medical Center, Aurora, Colorado] for many years.  And she went to church faithfully.  My grandmother was--I mean my dad [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] was her, her life, really, you know.  And she was very, you know, supportive of, of, of us as kids.  And I always remember going to her house for holidays and taking those photos where they make you dress up (laughter).  And, but it was unfortunate the last few years, I mean especially the last decade, you know, she suffered from Alzheimer's.  And so, it was very tough, especially for my father being the only child that, you know, towards the end, you know, she did not recognize him, and it was really hard to communicate with her.
Speaker 1: Do you know any more about her history at all?
Speaker 2: Not a lot.  I, I just think that, you know, she was a single mother.  And, and she really didn't talk about, you know, her life in Fort Worth [Texas] at all with us, 'cause at that time, you know, I mean, that, I'm sure that was really tough, especially for her family, you know, to be a single mother at that time, and have a young son, and then move with him to Denver [Colorado].  It was probably very tough, you know, for her to do.  But she was very close to her sisters.  And, and you know what, we have fond memories of them too, you know, them coming here for the summer and you know, different holidays and, and things like that.
Speaker 1: And, and what were her sisters' names?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: One was Annabelle [ph.] and, and I, it just escaped me the other one, 'cause she, she passed away about twenty years ago.  But you know, we still have cousins, like second, third, fourth cousins that live in Fort Worth, Dallas [Texas], area, and we see them in some occasions.  I mean there is a set of Wedgeworths.  And we can't con- we can't figure out the connection between us in terms of being related, but we know we're related 'cause there are Wedgeworths here in Denver and in Texas.  And we're just still trying to figure (laughter) that out, you know.  But we're, we know related somehow, so we're working on it (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 565126
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your mother.  Tell me her name.
Speaker 2: Cas--
Speaker 1: Spell her name also.
Speaker 2: Castella, C-A-S-T-E-L-L-A, Ellen Price Wedgeworth [Castella Price Wedgeworth].
Speaker 1: And when was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born I think in 1924.  And she had--when she was born, she had two stepbrothers, and then she had a brother and three other sisters [Nellie Price Moore, Anna Marie Price Swain, and Ruth Price Campbell].  And she grew up in Eufaula, Oklahoma, which is a very small town in Oklahoma, and you know, came from a sharecropper type family.  You know, my grandfather [Fred Price] was a laborer but also a farmer.  And he, you know, served in the [U.S.] military.  And my grandmother was like a housewife.  She took care of the kids.  And you know, at that time, especially my great-great-grandmother, you know, she was mulatto, and you know, she was, I mean she could really pass for Anglo actually.  In fact, some of my cousins still can to this day.  They have very light skin, blue eyes.  And you know, my mother talked more about her background growing up, how she had to pick cotton and you know, things like that when she was a young girl.  And, and then she moved here to Denver [Colorado] with her other sisters when she was a teenager and 'cause my grandmother--my grandfather had passed away by that time, and my grandmother was struggling, you know, even mentally.  And so she could--really couldn't take care of my mom and her sisters, and so she sent them here to live with one of her, her aunts, so.
Speaker 1: So let, let's get the names of your--you, you told us your mother, your grandmother.  What was your grandmother, and if you know (cough) excuse me--your grandfather's name.
Speaker 2: My grandmother's [sic. maternal great-grandmother] name was Ellen [Ellen Price], and my grandfather's just escaped me (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Fred [Fred Price]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Fred.  I'm sorry.  My grandmother's name--my granddad was Fred.  And you know, I--my mom just tells me how he was very tall, light-skinned, very strong, you know.  And my grandmother's name was Alice [Alice Price], and she got married like, when for the first time, she was like thirty, in her thirties.  And you know, she loved him very much.  You know, and it was--I don't think she ever recovered when he passed away, because when she did eventually move here, you know, she still was--would speak about him very fondly, even when you were little kids, so.
Speaker 1: And you talked about your great-grandmother or father.
Speaker 2: That's Ellen.
Speaker 1: Ellen, the great-grandma (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, my, my, my mother's name is Castella Ellen Price--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so she was named after my great-great-grandmother [sic.].
Story_ID: 565127
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your mother [Castella Price Wedgeworth] and father [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] met?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact.  It's really funny, 'cause my mom moved up here with her sisters and to Denver [Colorado].  And you know, they really didn't know anybody.  And they went to Manual--my mom went Manual High School [Denver, Colorado].  And she tells the story how she met my dad at Manual.  You know, she met him like the first week she was here or something, and he just kind of just glammed onto her.  And she got married right after she graduated from high school to my dad.  And she never dated anybody else other than my father actually.  But she was really beautiful, you know, long black hair, light-skinned.  And you know, they were like the new girls in town, you know.  And my aunts [Nellie Price Moore, Anna Marie Price Swain, and Ruth Price Campbell] were, were also just very beautiful, and you know, they were just very popular.  And my dad just saw my mom, zeroed in on her, and that's it (laughter).
Story_ID: 565128
Speaker 1: And what part of town did they settle in?
Speaker 2: In east Denver [Colorado] here in the Five Points area.  In the Five Points area this used to be like the area for African Americans in Denver, you know, where they lived, worked, and played.  So my mom [Castella Price Wedgeworth] moved in with her aunt, and she, who was a hairdresser and had her business here on Five Points.  And--
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of the business?
Speaker 2: Well, it's not right off the top of my--it was--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Aunt Edna [ph.].  It was like her--Edna's Beauty Salon [ph.] or--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you know, that's how she made her living.  And, and my, my mom married my dad [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] right after high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado].  And my Aunt Anna Marie [Anna Marie Price Swain], you know, she got married also.  And my Aunt Ruth [Ruth Price Campbell] eventually--see, when my grandmother [Alice Price] couldn't take care of my aunts and my mom, she--they were sent to different families.  So my oldest aunt, Aunt Nellie [Nellie Price Moore], she basically just left and moved to Kansas City [Missouri].  My uncle, he left and went to L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  My mom's younger sister, Ruth, they sent her to a different family.  And my other aunts came here.  And so then they eventually got my Aunt Ruth here, and, and she lived here for a while before she got married.
Story_ID: 565129
Speaker 1: What year are we, are we in that they were there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We're, we're in around 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your mother [Castella Price Wedgeworth] and father [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] get married, and how many children do they have?
Speaker 2: Six.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, let's do your siblings--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and let's do them in order--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and where you fall in.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Now just tell me a little bit about each one.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, my oldest brother is Tim Wedgeworth [Timothy Wedgeworth], and he--it's interesting 'cause we, we favor either mom or dad.  My brother, Tim, favors my mom.  My brother, Danny [Danny Wedgeworth], is next.  He favors more my father.  My brother Tim also--my, my, my brother, Clifford [Clifford Wedgeworth], also favors my dad.  And then my mom just happens to have a girl, my sister, Debra [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly], and my other brother, Walter, Jr. [Walter Wedgeworth, Jr.], and me, so I'm the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my name is a combination of my mother's middle name, Ellen, and my sister's name, 'cause my dad, I guess he got this epiphany, and he's like, "Oh, Elbra [HistoryMaker Elbra Wedgeworth].  It's like Debra," (laughter), even though my sister and I are four years apart, so (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and tell me a little bit about each one of them.
Speaker 2: My, my brother is, you know--most of my brothers are laborers, basically.  You know, my brother worked Caterpillar tractor company [Caterpillar Inc.] for many years.  He was very athletically great.  I mean he played basketball.  Most of my brothers and my sister and I were really into sports and excelled, especially my brothers in basketball and track, and my sister excelled in track.  And in fact, she got a scholarship to Tennessee State [Tennessee State University, Nashville, Tennessee], a track scholarship, and so, very athletic, very close.  I mean, you know, my parents, we were, we did everything together, go to the mountains--you know, we even had our tonsils taken out together.  You know, my mom sent us all to the hospital and get them all taken out at the same time and, 'cause you know, we were all like a year apart, basically.  And she didn't want us all getting sick, so she just had us all take them out the same time.  And so, I remember just spending a lot of time with my family growing up.  We--my mom didn't, you know, believe in us sleeping over at girlfriends' houses and stuff.  We were just at home, you know (laughter), and they were kind of very strict in that way.
Story_ID: 565130
Speaker 1: Well, tell me, what is your earliest childhood memory of your family?
Speaker 2: My family, we grew up in a public housing project, in Curtis Park [Denver, Colorado], which is right down the street.  And I remember just growing up as being in, in, in that community.  And you know, we really didn't have a lot of money, you know, and neither did anybody else, so you really didn't notice it.  But it was just a really tightknit community.  And I just remember us having a, you know, three bedroom apartment.  And my mom [Castella Price Wedgeworth]--my sister [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly] and I shared a room; my brothers [Timothy Wedgeworth, Danny Wedgeworth, Clifford Wedgeworth, and Walter Wedgeworth, Jr.], my four brothers were in one room, and my parents had the other room.  And you know, times were hard, you know.  I remember--you know, there are certain foods that now I don't eat now, like peanut butter (laughter), you know.  You know, I remember a lot of powdered milk and things like--I mean, and I was, must have been like ten or eleven years old where I, I realized that salmon didn't come in a can (laughter), you know.  And so, salmon croquettes, I mean those kind of things, you know, some of those foods I don't eat now: cereal (shakes head) (laughter) 'cause we just had so--'cause that's all we had.  You know, 'cause my dad [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.], you know, he had a lot of different jobs, and then he finally was a civil servant for the government, and, but my mom stayed at home; she was a housewife, you know.
Speaker 1: What were holidays like at your house?
Speaker 2: My--it was really, it was fun, 'cause my dad always would buy us gifts, you know, and my mom would always cook these big dinners.  And so, Thanksgiving and Christmas, you know, I remember those very vividly.  We also would have trips to the mountains, you know.  We--they would take us, all six of us, you know, in the '64 [1964] Chevy [Chevrolet] to the drive-in.  I don't know how we did that, but I remember those days too.  And so they would pack us all in the car and go on different excursions and stuff.
Speaker 1: Can you remember a specific time when you went to the mountains?  When you say to the mountains, tell me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well my dad would take--would get us all in the car, and we'd go up to like Estes Park [Colorado], you know, and just, you know, just be gone for a couple of hours, play in the snow, make snowballs and stuff, and, and I remember doing that, yeah.
Story_ID: 565131
Speaker 1: Now tell me about your community.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You said you grew up in a housing project.  Tell me who were the people--if you can remember--who were your friends?  And tell me what the neighborhood was like, the stores, and the shopkeepers.  And you said Five Points [Denver, Colorado] was an area where African Americans played and, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --shopped and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --whatever.  Give me a sense of what that was like.
Speaker 2: Well, in the neighborhood we grew up in was this Curtis Park [Denver, Colorado].  You know, the--your, your whole world was just those few blocks.  I mean the gro- grocery store was on the corner.  The park was across the street.  The elementary school [Gilpin Elementary School; Gilpin Montessori School, Denver, Colorado] was like two blocks away.  So that was your whole world, you know.  And so the people that you knew then, I mean, that's all you knew, you know, basically.  And, and everybody was, you know, struggling and you know, trying to get into a better life.  You know, my dad's [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] goal was to eventually buy a house.  And I'll never forget it's around na- the mid-'60s [1960s] when he finally was able to get enough money to buy a house.  But also remember that that was the year we didn't get any Christmas presents, 'cause my dad spent all the money on the deposit for the house.  And I remember he felt so bad about that.  And you know it's, it was just fun.  I was just a real--I had fond memories of those days because we--the same people that--some of them we grew up with, you know, we went to elementary school, junior high with, and high school with.  So it's just like a continuing kind of broader family.  And then when we did move, you know, you felt like you were going to a, you know, a different country.  But you were really only moving like ten block away.  You know, you're just moving to a different neighborhood [Cole, Denver, Colorado].  And, but my dad, you know, that was the, the goal at that time, just get out the projects, get into a house, you know, make a better life for your family.  And that's what my dad was able to do.
Speaker 1: And the community that you lived in, even though--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it was the--
Speaker 2: It was preda (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) housing (unclear)--it was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of course--
Speaker 2: It was predominantly black--
Speaker 1: --black--
Speaker 2: --African American.  And we also had Latino and some Asian families, so very few, if any, Anglos were in the neighborhood, I mean, going even from elementary school [Columbine Elementary School, Denver, Colorado] to junior high [Cole Junior High School; Cole Arts and Science Academy, Denver, Colorado] to high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado].  You know, this was a predominantly African American community.  I didn't really get more around Anglos until I went to college [University of Redlands, Redlands, California], which was a totally different world for me--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause I just wasn't used to that.
Speaker 1: Were the, were there two parent households?
Speaker 2: Very few.  We were one of the very few that had my mom [Castella Price Wedgeworth] and dad and, 'cause most of the people that we were around, they were mostly single mothers.  But there were, there were a couple, but were very, there were very few of us that had mom and dad.
Story_ID: 565132
Speaker 1: If I asked you about a sound, a sight, or a smell that takes you back to that time, what would you think of?
Speaker 2: Oh, I remember, especially for every like, holiday, my mom [Castella Price Wedgeworth] cooking chitterlings for my father [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] and me having to help her clean them.  I always was not happy about that (laughter).  But she would always fix chitterlings for my father, especially around New Year's.  And they didn't have the pre-cleaned ones back in those days.  I mean you had to literally clean them, and I just dreaded that every year.  But you know, the smell and stuff is still very real for me, even now.
Speaker 1: What about a sou- sight or sound?
Speaker 2: I think just playing in the neighborhood.  You know, 'cause we had a playground right there.  And so just, you know, going out and playing with your friends, playing marbles and, and things like that, that was, that was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Now what about religion?  What's your earliest memory of any religious experience and--
Speaker 2: Well, my grandmother [Armonia Wedgeworth Whiting] was very religious.  She was more Pentecostal, but my mom and dad were Baptist.  My dad never went to church, very rarely.  My mom sometimes would take us to Sunday school and things like that, but she wasn't really, you know, she didn't really insist on it.
Story_ID: 565133
Speaker 1: And tell me the elementary school that you went to.
Speaker 2: Well, I started at Gilpin Elementary School [Gilpin Montessori School, Denver, Colorado].  And then when my parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] moved to Cole neighborhood [Denver, Colorado], then I went to Columbine [Columbine Elementary School, Denver, Colorado].  And then I went to Cole Junior High School [Cole Arts and Science Academy, Denver, Colorado], and then I graduated from Manual High School [Denver, Colorado], the same parent--school my parents met at.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)--
Speaker 2: All of us went to Manual, by the way (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me about the first elementary school, and--
Speaker 2: Gilpin.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was there a, a fam- famous--not famous--I'm sorry--favorite teacher that you can remember or somebody that might have influenced you or encouraged you in any way?
Speaker 2: Not as much at Gilpin but at Columbine, Mrs.--I remember Mrs. Flagar [ph.].  You know, she's this very tall, very beautiful, Anglo woman.  And I remember that it was so controversial 'cause it, it seemed like, you know, she was, she was friends with another African American male teacher.  And this was like in the '60s [1960s] at that time, so that was kind of like, wow, you know.  So a lot of people kind of took double looks at that sometimes.  But she was, she was, she really had me learning and explored.  I thought about, you know, different countries.  And there was a different world outside of, you know, where I was at, and she basically opened that world for me, you know, at that time.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I was--my sister [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly] was better.  She was much more of an academic than me.  And I didn't really start buckling down until, you know, later (laughter).  But, I mean, I, I think I was a good student, good attendance.  You know, I, I used to get different awards and things like that.  But I was much more just, you know, just going to school, you know.  And it wasn't as much of an importance to me until later.
Story_ID: 565134
Speaker 1: Well, then what type of child were you?  Were you mischievous or quiet (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I wasn't mischieve--
Speaker 1: --or--
Speaker 2: I was a little bit quiet, but I was very, kind of like, why.  You know, I was like, you know, why is this happening, you know; how come we can't do this; and why are this--why is this happening, you know.  'Cause I remember when, when Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was killed.  I remember when Kennedy was killed.  I was at school--class at the time.  And I would be saying--go home and say, you know, why did they do this, you know, why did they kill this man, you know.  And, and so I was always very inquisitive as a kid, you know, and but quiet.  I, I think I was much closer to my mom [Castella Price Wedgeworth] than my dad [Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.].  My sister [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly] was much closer to my dad, because he was much more into sports, and my sister was into track and things like that.  And, and so, you know, but it was, it was a good--I mean I, I remember my childhood very vividly because it was--I learned a lot, and my parents were supportive, you know, in terms of our education.
Speaker 1: Was there anything that you can--a, a story that you can--you said you remember very vividly.  Is there something that, that stands out that you remember about your childhood?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember, you know, just, I just thought it was so--I always wanted to, you know, grow up fast.  I thought, you know, when I would do a timetable, I thought oh, year 2000 I'm gonna be so old then (laughter).  I could imagine what it would be like to be living in 2000.  And, and then I just started reading a lot.  I really got into mythology and biographies on different people and, and just really realized that it was a different world out there other than, you know, here.  And my parents really en- encouraged that in us, just like, you know, you can do whatever you want to.  There's a different world out there, and you need to explore it.
Speaker 1: And you were active in athletics.  Was there any organized sports at that time--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that you were--
Speaker 2: They had different like track teams and basketball teams.  I was mostly like into track, and then I got into cheerleading and, and things like that.  I didn't really get more into academics until like junior high [Cole Junior High School; Cole Arts and Science Academy, Denver, Colorado] and high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado].
Story_ID: 565135
Speaker 1: So, you went to Columbine [Columbine Elementary School, Denver, Colorado].  You left Columbine and went to Manual High School [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 2: Columbine and then Cole Junior High [Cole Junior High School; Cole Arts and Science Academy, Denver, Colorado]--
Speaker 1: Cole Junior High.
Speaker 2: --and then went to Manual High School.
Speaker 1: What are your memories about Cole?
Speaker 2: That's, Cole was fun.  I mean, we basically--it was much more of a social kind of thing, you know.  And, and still a lot of the kids that I went to elementary school, they went to Cole too.  And so, I remember that, and then I remember getting more involved in student activities and fundraising kind of things, like making popcorn balls (laughter), things like that, which was kind of interesting.
Speaker 1: Tell me about popcorn balls.
Speaker 2: Well, we started a cheerleading squad, and we wanted to buy our uniforms.  And so, one of our teachers, Ann Applewhite [Ann Simpson Applewhite], who I still am in touch with, by the way, she said, "Well, let's make popcorn balls, and we'll sell them.  And we can, you know, buy the materials, and you guys can make uniforms."  And we did, and it was successful.  We were like, great (laughter).  And so that was a good memory, yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and was there another teacher or someone who influenced or encouraged you during that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Sal Carpio.  He was our gym teacher and Latino.  And what's so funny about Sal is, you know, he eventually became a city councilmember, and then he became the director of the Denver Housing Authority here in Denver [Colorado].  And, and here I'm like a junior high school student, you know, participating in his classes.  And then like twenty something years later, I'm the city councilperson that represents the district where he has some of his projects.  So, the moral of that story is that be young--be nice to young people 'cause you never know where we're gonna end up (laughter), you don't, you really don't.  So that's really funny.  And I do tell people that story about Sal, and he used to get so embarrassed, but it's true.  I mean, you know, the, the memories, and the, and the opportunities, and how you're treated as a young person stays with you.  And you know, he had a lot of respect for younger people.  He respected our ideas and our feelings.  And you know, and it's good now that I can thank him for that, because that was a good foundation for me and other young people that he, he took interest in, so.
Story_ID: 565136
Speaker 1: Was there any interest in, in music or the arts?
Speaker 2: The arts, you know, mostly like theater arts, and that eventually--more in high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] and then, and definitely in college [University of Redlands, Redlands, California].  But it was getting more, a little bit more into academics and, and the importance of academics at that, I think at that stage in my life in junior high [Cole Junior High School; Cole Arts and Science Academy, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were your aspirations at that time?  Did you have any like between elementary school and into junior high school?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.  Well, I wanted to travel.  I wanted to be either in the Peace Corps or be a social worker.  And so that's what I would tell my mom [Castella Price Wedgeworth], that I would want to--I really was thinking about going to the Peace Corps for a while.  And then I decided to, to go to college instead and you know, then become a social worker.
Speaker 1: In other activities in junior high school, you said you were a cheerleader and you know--
Speaker 2: Ran track (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) really and, and basically started to pick up on your academics.  Were you still doing a lot of reading?  What were you reading now?
Speaker 2: I was reading more about different countries and the people in those countries, like about South America and about Europe.  And this was really fascinating to me.
Speaker 1: What about the, the neighborhood [Cole, Denver, Colorado]?  Now you moved from the housing project to a home.  Tell me about that neighborhood and about that house.
Speaker 2: It was still a predominantly black neighborhood.  It was only about ten blocks away from the housing project.  And so the majority of families that lived in that neighborhood, you know, were African American, you know, some Latinos, few Asians, and all brick homes, you know, basements and, and so, that's--we used to, used to have a lot of parties in our basement, you know, 'cause my brothers [Timothy Wedgeworth, Danny Wedgeworth, Clifford Wedgeworth, and Walter Wedgeworth, Jr.] and sister [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly] were older.  They were in high school then and, and running track and doing different activities, so they would bring friends home, you know, and, and entertain my--their friends here at our house.
Story_ID: 565137
Speaker 1: We were talking about, about your move to, you know, to the home (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The, the Cole neighborhood [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: --home, right.  And this was during the '60s [1960s].  And can you talk about the climate, you know, civil rights, the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party]?  What was going on in Denver [Colorado] at that time?
Speaker 2: It was really an interesting time because in the '60s [1960s], you know, the, the black community was just in one pretty much section of town.  And I remember vividly when I was in junior high school [Cole Junior High School; Cole Arts and Science Academy, Denver, Colorado] and the Black Panthers came and took over our school.  And I, I can't remember the circumstances behind that, but they took over our school.  They basically told all the students to go home.  And so I go home, and I'm knocking on the door.  You know, my mom's [Castella Price Wedgeworth] like, "What are you doing here?"  I said, "The Black Panthers just took over the school."  My mother closed the door--got her purse, closed the door, and took me back to school (laughter).  And said, "My, you know, my daughter is here to get an education.  I don't know what's going on with you people in here, but she's staying here."  And so it was so--Lauren Watson, I mean, it, it was a time that my parents kind of struggled with, 'cause they just didn't understand that.  'Cause in their time, you know, you just didn't, you know, it was a different world.  And my brothers [Timothy Wedgeworth, Danny Wedgeworth, Clifford Wedgeworth, and Walter Wedgeworth, Jr.] and my sister [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly] were into black power.  And you know, I remember when my sister and I wanted to get a fro, my mom didn't want us to have one.  And you know, we basc- my parents had to go out of town for like two weeks, and we ended up staying with my grandmother [Armonia Wedgeworth Whiting] and wearing a fro the whole time.  And by the time they got back, you know, we just kept them, you know.  But my parents really didn't understand that, you know, the Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture], you know, all--they were just--it was just foreign to them.  But, and we didn't really have a lot of African Americans in political leadership either, so we didn't have a lot of people speaking for our, for our community until later in the '70s [1970s] and the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Now, the schools were--so you entered into schools that were integrated.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but predominantly African American at that point.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And busing, what about busing?  Was there any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Busing--
Speaker 1: --busing at that time.
Speaker 2: --busing didn't really occur in Denver until the mid-'70s [1970s].  And so, you know, the people that you went to junior--to elementary school, high--junior high and high school with, you know, you just went to school with these folks, you know, 'cause they were from the same community, same surrounding neighborhoods.  And so, the folks you knew in elementary school, the same folks you knew in high school, and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in--you say your, your parents, were they involved at all in civil rights?
Speaker 2: They weren't involved in any of that.  I mean they just--I think that it's mainly because they just didn't understand it.  And they were like, well, you know, they'd grew up so hard and were, you know, and treated so badly throughout, you know, those early years, they, they just like, no, you know, it's trouble, you know, kind of thing to them.
Story_ID: 565138
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you said that you remember when Kennedy and King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] was assassinated.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What do you remember about that time?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember when Dr. King was assassinated, I remember walking home and seeing like all the, most of the trash cans on fire, you know, and, and wondering, you know, why, why is this happening, you know.  And I remember being really upset and crying and, and trying to just understand it all.  You know, I just didn't understand it at all.
Speaker 1: Did your parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] not have any, any words for you to--
Speaker 2: Well, they basically were trying to comfort us.  But I think that also too, they--it was just kind of, you know, my folks were just simple folks.  They were not in politics or anything like that.  They just were trying to make it as a family.  And I think that it was just difficult for them to try to get us through that time, 'cause it was--it affected you individually, your family, your community, I mean everyone.  And it was kind of hard to kind of get your arms around I think.
Story_ID: 565139
Speaker 1: So you go on to what high school?  Manual High School [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 2: Manual, the same high school my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Same, right.
Speaker 2: --parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] met at, yeah.
Speaker 1: So tell me about the transition from junior high [Cole Junior High School; Cole Arts and Science Academy, Denver, Colorado] to high school.
Speaker 2: Well, it was interesting for me 'cause remember I had brothers [Timothy Wedgeworth, Danny Wedgeworth, Clifford Wedgeworth, and Walter Wedgeworth, Jr.] and sisters [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly].  And so, you know, they all went to the same, you know, junior high and high school.  So by time I got there, you know, a lot of the teachers and stuff knew my, my siblings.  And, and you know, it was a great time, 'cause it was, you know, you wanted to go to Manual 'cause it was like the school.  You know, we won all the sporting--we won basketball and track, and we was just like a real history, a legacy going to Manual High School.  And you know, I was very proud to, to go there.  And I focused more on my academics at that point and became involved in a lot of student activities and student groups and things like that.
Speaker 1: What, what groups were you involved in?
Speaker 2: Like academic clubs, and you know, I was cheerleading, and I was, you know, Owl's Debutante [Owl Club of Denver Debutante Cotillion].  You know, I did all this kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Owl's Debutante?
Speaker 2: It's kind of like a, a Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] kind of thing that we do here for, for young girls.  It's a coming out thing for African American girls--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --African American kind of introduction to, you know, the kind of Denver [Colorado], black Denver kind of society world (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And was, how was that for you?  I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was fun.
Speaker 1: --did your sister go through it as well?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she did (laughter). So--
Speaker 1: Okay. So what, what did you do to prepare for it?
Speaker 2: Oh, well, you would have to, you know, like, go and learn the dance, you know, and get the date.  And then your father would escort you in, and they'd introduce you.  And you know, you'd have to do a waltz kind of thing.  And so, I remember all that.
Speaker 1: Was this a, a type of class thing every you--young woman, they get an opportunity (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it's kind of--
Speaker 1: --to do this?
Speaker 2: --more of a society kind of like a private organization event.  It's kind of like the Boule or what The Links [The Links, Incorporated] do every year, you know, for their students, like the bla- like the, the black and white kind of thing, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 565140
Speaker 1: Tell me what else in high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] that you remember. What stands out in your mind about high school.
Speaker 2: Well, boys (laughter).  That was important, 'cause that's when we would, you know, be going out and going to parties.  And you know, my family--my parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] were very strict.  I mean I had to be home by eleven [o'clock], you know.  And I didn't start dating until I was like sixteen, seventeen, something like that.  And, but they started getting looser by the time they got to me, 'cause I think my brothers [Timothy Wedgeworth, Danny Wedgeworth, Clifford Wedgeworth, and Walter Wedgeworth, Jr.] and my sister [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly] kind of loosened my parents up to not as be as strict when they got to me.  So I kind of, I was able to get a lot--away with a lot more things than they did when they were my age, so, so thank you (laughter).
Speaker 1: And what about the prom?  Did you have--
Speaker 2: I had the, I went to the prom (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You went to the prom.
Speaker 2: And I remember Paul (unclear) [ph.] was my date, and that was fun.  And, and so we were--I was able to stay out late that night.  We would go to dinner, and go to the dance, and you know.  So that was really a fond memory, you know.
Story_ID: 565141
Speaker 1: And then being excited about, you know, going to school, going to college, leaving home.  It was kind of scary because you know that your whole world is, you know, and you go to a totally different environment, you know.  But I knew that leaving home was gonna be important 'cause I knew there was another world out there that I needed to know about, and I wasn't gonna know about it here.  And most of the kids I went to high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] with, they were going to University of Colorado, Greeley [University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado].  I'm like, you know, I've been with these same folks for many years.  I need to explore other folk (laughter), you know.  And so that was exciting.  But it was hard for my parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] because, you know, I was leaving home for the first time, so.
Speaker 2: Your, your reading about traveling and, and different cultures.  Was that something that helped you decide that you just needed--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --to get away?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And also I had had a teacher at that time that was like, you know, you, you would benefit from a, a small liberal arts education.  And he told me about the University of Redlands [Redlands, California].  It was in California, and it was like, you know, not too far from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] where my bra- my mom's brother was.  So I think she felt a comfort level there that I would be able to go to school, that, that her brother would be there for me if I needed him, and yeah.
Speaker 2: You said that you began to understand also that academics were important.  So did you become a really good student?
Speaker 1: I became a much better student.  I mean I started to buckle down more.  You know, 'cause at times, you know, the more important thing was me--to me was where the next party was, I mean.  But I knew in order to, to get further, I needed to buckle down and really focus on my, my, my education, and, and I did that.
Speaker 2: Who paid for your college education?
Speaker 1: I got a partial scholarship, and then once that was out, my dad paid for it.
Speaker 2: And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 1: I graduated from high school in 1974.
Story_ID: 565142
Speaker 1: So now you're, you're ready to go off to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Go off in the world.
Speaker 1: --to college.  And tell me, what was the preparation like and then the transition?
Speaker 2: Well, the preparation was exciting 'cause I applied for different schools, and then I got into the University of Redlands [Redlands, California].  And I thought, well, this'll be great, you know, going to California, close to Los Angeles [California].  It was like an adventure, you know.  And I was really looking forward to, but in a way I was kind of scared because I, I had--I mean, I was so close to my parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.], I mean, you know, and I had never really been away from home before.  But I knew that that was a step I needed to take, and they were, encouraged me to do it.  And it was hard for them too I think, but it was--you know, my other siblings had left and, and gone on with their lives and stuff.  And, and I remember that first week at Redlands, and I thought, wow, this is totally different (laughter), you know, 'cause out of like three thousand students, we had like maybe two hundred black students.  And, but that week I met these two young ladies, one from San Bernardino [California] and this other one from more towards Northern California, you know, Orange County [California], and Lisa and--Winger [Lisa Winger (ph.)] and Erica McKay [ph.].  And for some reason, we just hit it off, you know.  I mean, we were so totally different from each other.  And here, thirty-two years later we're still friends (laughter).
Speaker 1: Were they African American, white (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they were Anglo.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And, and it was different for them, for me too, 'cause, I mean, they really hadn't been around African Americans and, and you know, they're, you know, they're friends with someone that--who's not even from here.  They're from California, and I'm from Colorado.  And so it was a unique experience, and we've remained friends.
Speaker 1: Were they in your dorm?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're on the same floor (laughter).  And that was freshman week, and so that's how we met.
Speaker 1: And what else was an experience there?  What about the classes?  Did you feel prepared to be there with these students?
Speaker 2: In some cases I did.  I mean 'cause in some, some of the instances, I mean, some of these students were, came from very wealthy families.  And I was just kind of like, how, you know.  I, I, I was like, I, I didn't know what to do or say, you know.  And, but I was prepared, and I, in some cases I wasn't, but I adapted.  And, and it just kind of helped me adapt to different things in life and different situations, and that's what I really took away from it.  And then, you know, I remember--this is really funny--when we would have people come in and speak, you know, like Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] came to campus and was going to give a talk, a lecture, and I'd call my parents.  And, and they were like, "Oh, you know, you can't go to that, you know."  And I'm like, what's wrong with going to see (laughter) Stokely Carmichael?  And they thought it was just, you know, I would just leave school or something, you know (laughter), so.
Story_ID: 565143
Speaker 1: Well, did you join any organizations?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I joined--like we had a black student union group and a couple of different organizations.  And I started developing much more of an interest in theater arts, and that became my minor.  So I had a sociology/anthropology major and a theater arts minor.  So I got more into plays and, and things like that.
Speaker 1: What was your first play?
Speaker 2: It was kind of a, a Faust type parody play and where I played the devil (laughter).  And, and I also developed, you know, more of an interest in social issues and social problems and, and had an internship in Indio, California, working with juveniles and diversion.  And, and that was kind of my focus, you know, more into social work once I got to my senior year.  And that's what I wanted to do, is come back to Denver [Colorado], you know, be a--go, get into social work, save the world from itself, especially at the Five Points, northeast Denver area.  And, but they don't want to be saved (laughter).  Plus Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] had cut all the social programs at that point, so it's very hard to get a job in that area.
Speaker 1: Who, who was the president of the school at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, god, I think it was Armacost [sic. Eugene E. Dawson].  And it was--you know, Redlands was a beautiful campus [University of Redlands, Redlands, California].  I mean, oran- you'd walk to classes, there was oranges growing on the trees, and, and so it's a, a great environment.  They're very comforting and supportive environment, small liberal arts campus, you know.  So, it was a good adjustment for me.  And there, there were a few people that were from Colorado.  Especially Charlene Elliott [ph.], who was an African American who knew my sister [Debra Wedgeworth Kelly], went there.  And so that kind of made it a little bit better of an adjustment to me, knowing a couple of people from Colorado that were there.
Speaker 1: And how do you, how did you feel from going to from predominantly all-black campus to, you know--
Speaker 2: It was a, it was a bit of an adjustment.  I mean it wasn't a hard adjustment, but it's kind of like, you know, it was just different, you know.  I, and I just knew--I said hey, I wanted to know what the world was like, and, and now this was a good, good opportunity for me to learn it.
Speaker 1: And what about your teachers, the professors there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) There were a few African American professors and, but the Anglo professors I had, they were very good.  I mean they were very supportive, especially during that freshman/junior year--sophomore year--freshman/sophomore year, 'cause around that time and you're thinking, well, do I want to quit (laughter) or do something else?  But my parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] totally freaked, and they're like, oh, my god, she wants to leave school (laughter).  And then you make it through the junior year, and then you're fine, you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And was there anything else that was memorable about Redlands?
Speaker 2: Just, you know, it was just a great environment, great school.  I met some great people.  And it, it, it showed me how to be responsible, much more responsible for myself and set goals.  And you know, I, I, I think if--'cause I could have gone to Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  I could have gone to--my sister and my brother, Danny [Danny Wedgeworth], they went to African American schools [HBCUs].  But I wouldn't trade the opportunity for Redlands.  I think it was a good choice for me.
Story_ID: 565144
Speaker 1: And you graduated in seventy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Seventy-eight [1978].
Speaker 1: Seventy-eight [1978]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: With a degree in sociology/anthropology and a minor in theater arts.
Speaker 1: So now what were your thoughts?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be a social worker.
Speaker 1: And how did you prepare to, to reach that goal?
Speaker 2: Well, I came here to Denver [Colorado], and I was applying for different jobs.  I wanted to apply for the city and the state in social work.  But a lot of those programs were being cut at that time 'cause Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was in office.  And so I decided to go into an anti-crime program in this Five Points neighborhood [Denver, Colorado].  It was a grant from the [U.S.] Department of Justice, I believe, something like that.  And so we just basically worked with neighborhoods and neighborhood residents talking about crime programs and how we can, you know, fight crime in the neighborhood.  And so that was good, you know, kind of introduction to get back into the neighborhood issues again.  And then, you know, like with a lot of, you know, social programs at that point, you know, the money ran out.  And then I had to get into the hospitality industry.  And so I worked for a Quality Inns International [Quality Inns International, Inc.] for a couple of years and then the Cosmopolitan Hotel [Denver, Colorado] downtown.  And then I went--
Speaker 1: What, what were your positions?  What did you do?
Speaker 2: Just basically just personnel administrative assistant, you know, those positions.  And then I worked for a medical products company for a while in personnel.  So I kind of went from wanting to be a social worker and, and veered into personnel management for a couple of years.
Story_ID: 565145
Speaker 1: Then around 1989 a friend of mine--that's when I started really getting interested in politics, 'cause a friend of mine was running for a state representative seat in southeast Denver [Colorado].  And you know, she asked some of her friends to help her with a campaign, and I was one of those friends (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What was her name?
Speaker 1: Ann Duckett.  And she was running for state representative.  And during that time, I had another friend that worked at city council [Denver City Council], who said that there was a staff analyst position available and would I be interested in apply for it, and I did, and, and I got the position.  And that's what started my career in city government here in Colorado.
Speaker 2: And, and tell me about a staff analyst.
Speaker 1: Basically, you draft the bills and legislation for the city council members.  You do research for them; you draft resolutions, ordinances, staff committees, and so it was good, you know, learning ground, to learn about government from the ground up, and you know, advising them on bills and policy and that's, those types of things.
Speaker 2: And who was the city council--is, is it chairperson?
Speaker 1: Well, the city council director who hired me was John Bennett.  And we have a thirteen member city council.  And at that time, it was people like Cathy Reynolds and Ted Hackworth and Bob Crider [Robert Crider].  And so it was a good, good experience.  And at that point is when Federico Pena was mayor, at that point.  And--
Speaker 2: Tell me a little bit about him.
Speaker 1: Well, Federico started as an attorney, and then he was a state representative, and then he ran for mayor against Bill McNichols [William H. McNichols, Jr.], who had been our mayor for like twenty years or something like that.  I mean he had been in office for a long time.  And it was kind of like what you see now with, you know, the Bush [President George Walker Bush] regime and Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] coming in.  And Federico was a fresh face, new ideas, young, Latino, you know, and this really excited the city.  And we had a major stor- storm that was just a disaster, and nobody could go anywhere, get anywhere.  And he used that to his advantage to unseat this incumbent that had been running this machine for like, forever.  And so it was a great time to come in and have a new, new opportunities for Denver, especially our first person of color to be the mayor.
Speaker 2: So there, there's a, a pretty--well, I guess the, the Hispanic population is even larger than the African American community.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and, and then it was just growing but at this point, definitely, definitely.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And at this time, you said in, this was in '89 [1989]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So, let me see, George Bush [President George Herbert Walker Bush], Daddy Bush was in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, and I wasn't--
Speaker 2: --in office at that time.
Speaker 1: --and I really wasn't that much into politics at that point.  I mean I started to get more into activism with neighborhood community issues and getting more interested in politics.  So I would mostly just volunteer my time for different initiatives.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, how long did he stay in office, Federico?
Speaker 1: Federico?  He basically stayed for a full term, which is four years, and then part of his second term, 'cause that's when Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton], you know, was elected.  And he, you know, had Federico as his, one of his cabinet members.  And that's when [HistoryMaker] Wellington Webb was city auditor.  And at that opportunity, Wellington ran for mayor at that point.
Story_ID: 565146
Speaker 1: So [HistoryMaker] Wellington Webb worked at--you worked with him.
Speaker 2: Well, what happened is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was with city council [Denver City Council].  And you know, Wellington had lived here forever too, but he more knew my parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] than me, you know, because at the time I was grown--coming up, you know, I was already in college [University of Redlands, Redlands, California] and everything and away for a while.  And so he really wasn't as familiar with me as he was with my folks, 'cause my folks lived down the street from him.  And, but then, you know, he would know me and see me around.  And, and one day he walked up to me and said you know, "I was just kind of watching you, and, and I think that it would be great if you came to work for me."
Speaker 1: Now he was the, the city auditor--
Speaker 2: The city auditor at that time.
Speaker 1: --and--okay.  And do you know much more about him?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, Wellington came here when he was a young child, because he'd moved here from Chicago [Illinois] because of his asthma.  And he went to Manual High School [Denver, Colorado] (laughter) and went to school on a basketball scholarship.  He eventually ran for state representative and then was appointed by Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] to run reg- his regulatory agency here in Colorado and then decided to run for city auditor and won.  So, by the time I met Wellington, he was the auditor for the city.  And, and so I decided what a great opportunity.  You know, I'd liked mayor, I liked to--met Auditor Webb at that time and thought it'd be a great opportunity to work for him.  And, and then I was his liaison to city council and the mayor's office, which was Federico Pena.  And then when Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] won and Federico was appointed, that's when mayor--he decided to run for mayor.  And I helped with his campaign, and when he won, then I was one of the people he took with him to the mayor's office.
Story_ID: 565147
Speaker 1: Tell me about the experience of working on a campaign.
Speaker 2: Well, that campaign was very interesting because, here you're in the middle of the Rocky Mountains, and you have an African American city auditor, and the district attorney, Norm Early [Norman S. Early, Jr.], and they're both African American (laughter).  And people were kind of like, wow, how'd this happen?  So it was really exciting, but it was, in some ways, it's kind of what's really divisive, especially in the African American community, is some folks were either for Norm or they were for Wellington [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb], you know.  And it's--I remember the woman who just called me on the phone, I remember she was working for somebody who was supporting Norm.  And we're, we're friends even now, but at that time, people were looking at us, going how can you guys be friends?  We're like well we've been friends for a long time.  What are you talking about?  That's how tense it got.  And you know, Wellington won, and it's just amazing, you know.  I mean it's--and even to this day, Norm Early is, I consider him a really good friend.  But at that point, it was just very, in some ways, divisive in the community, you know, but, and it took a little bit of time to heal that.  But it's, it's amazing, you know, to have the first black mayor.
Speaker 1: And why do you think that Wellington won over (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because he took--
Speaker 1: --(unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was a grassroots approach.  I mean he didn't have really a lot of money, so what he did is, he just walked the city.  And he would spend the night--he would walk the city during the day, and at night he would spend it at a neighbor's home or community, or he would be at a homeless shelter.  And he, he literally walked the city and won over the residents of Denver [Colorado].  And he was in office for twelve years.
Story_ID: 565148
Speaker 1: So you go to work for him [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when he becomes the mayor.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In what position?
Speaker 2: I started off as his legislative liaison for city council [Denver City Council] in the auditor's office.  And then he promoted me to different positions throughout his administration.  And I ended up finally being the clerk of the City and County of Denver [Colorado] and who was, you know, over, you know, all public records and served as a board of county commissioner.  And, and so I think that I really kind of proved myself and, and I learned a lot.  I mean, 'cause at that time, then I had worked for all three branches: city council, auditor's office, and the mayor's office.
Speaker 1: And most people don't work for, in a lifetime--
Speaker 2: Oh, now I know.  This was a very unique opportunity, and so I took advantage of that, you know.  And I learned a lot, and I learned, you know, the public/private sector piece in terms of how to connect people.  And, and that knowledge was just invaluable.
Story_ID: 565149
Speaker 1: And then Denver Health [Denver, Colorado] became a hospital authority.  This, they branched out on their own.  And I thought that would be a unique opportunity, because I had two main focuses or interests at that time, was healthcare and housing.  And I thought, well, you know, I'm clerk and recorder, and that's great.  But eventually I thought, you know, Wellington's [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb] gonna leave office eventually 'cause he'll be term limited in a few years, so working at Denver Health would be a great opportunity for me.  And so Dr. Patricia Gabow offered me the position of the director of philanthropic affairs to be over the foundation [Denver Health Foundation, Denver, Colorado] and also be her point person on community outreach.  And I thought, okay, I'm gonna go for it, 'cause the one thing, I, I really loved challenges and, and things.  And so I went to go work for, for Patty, and it was a great opportunity.  I worked there for like three years and then--
Speaker 2: What were some of your responsibilities?
Speaker 1: I basically had to restart the foundation 'cause it had been dormant for many years.  And so I had to start from scratch, from the bylaws to soliciting board members to, you know, raising money and which was great, 'cause now, 'cause the foundation is still going on and, you know, viable, which is good.  And in the community outreach we created a community voices program to try to recruit people that were not insured to be insured and to get the children on the child healthcare plan.  And so that was a good thing too.  So we would work a lot throughout various communities, and work with barbers, work with beauty shop owners, work with people, neighborhood folks, you know, just to keep people insured, because that was important for us.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 565150
Speaker 1: And so what happens next?
Speaker 2: So what happens next is I'm at Denver Health [Denver, Colorado], and our current councilperson for this--'cause I'd always still lived in east Denver [Colorado], you know, and our councilperson was Hiawatha Davis [Hiawatha Davis, Jr.].  He has been our councilperson for like sixteen years.  We had only had like three council people, you know, Elvin Caldwell [Elvin R. Caldwell], King Trimble [King M. Trimble], and Hiawatha.  And Hiawatha decided to work for Wellington [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb] in an appointed position.  And unbeknownst to us, he also had prostate cancer, and so he was stepping down.  And then a lot of different people had approached me, 'cause during that whole time period, I was involved in neighborhood issues.  I was president of the neighborhood association where I lived.  And, and people were saying, you know, "Look, you were born and raised in this community; you have all this knowledge about the city; you know, we think you should run for Hi's seat," you know.  And I, at first, I was very reluctant because I thought, you know, I'd seen what, you know, politics is and you know, and the scrutiny and all that.  And, and my parents [Castella Price Wedgeworth and Walter Wedgeworth, Sr.] were like, you know, "Do you really want to do that?"  And I'm like, well, you know, I want to serve our community 'cause I think you made that very clear to us that that was important when we were growing up.  And so, I decided to run.  And so it was a special election in December of '99 [1999], and there were like eleven of us, eleven opponents that I had, and I won, so.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And what was your campaign like?
Speaker 2: Basically, it was like, I can hit the ground running.  I know what committees are with city council [Denver City Council].  I know how to get things done.  I know who to talk to, to get them done.  I already have relationships throughout city government.  And I think because of my background and 'cause I grew up in the community.  And I remember my mom and dad going getting my signatures with all their friends and neighbors and stuff, so I had a built-in base of people that I knew that I could count on and just kind of built upon that, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 565151
Speaker 1: You were talking about your run for city coun (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) City council [Denver City Council]--
Speaker 1: --council.
Speaker 2: --for District 8 [Denver, Colorado].  So, you know, it was a special election, ran against eleven opponents, and I won.  I got 42 percent of the vote.  And I was the first woman to be the council representative of this area.  And so it was a very exciting time but just had to hit the ground running because had a lot of, of things to do, infrastructure projects I wanted to get done.  And so I established a good relationship, you know, with Mayor Webb [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb], you know, who had mentored me over the years, but also with our--my city council colleagues, 'cause you know, you need seven votes to get anything approved.  So, I used the first couple of years to just really establish a kind of goal for myself in terms of different projects I wanted to get done, and get them in the pipeline, get them funded, and, and get them da- accomplished, so that's what I did.
Speaker 1: There was a question about when you're elected and, and when you're appointed.  And how do you just go in and just begin to work?
Speaker 2: Well, and I think that was the, the, the advantage I had because I had been in government at that time, you know, over a decade.  And so, I had experience with city council, the auditor's office, the mayor's office; I knew how all of them worked; I knew what the city budget was and how that process went.  I knew how you passed an ordinance, got, you know, funding for an appropriation.  So I had that knowledge going in, which and some people wouldn't have that knowledge.  And so, I was able to take advantage of the opportunity to help my community and, and then help the city at large.
Story_ID: 565152
Speaker 1: So, what were some of your initiatives that you had (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, one of the ones is this library, the Blair-Caldwell African American Research Library [Denver, Colorado].  And we wanted to have a facility that would honor the legacy and the contributions of African Americans of the Rocky Mountain West.  And so it's the only research library of its kind in the Rocky Mountains.  And so that's one of the things I helped to get funded and built, along with Martin Luther King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] statue, a lot of infrastructure projects for various parks throughout the district.  We named a park after Madam C.J. Walker, who started her business in Denver [Colorado], by the way.  I don't whether a lot of people know that.  Her hair, her hair care business was started in Denver in early 1900s--a lot of funding for housing projects, working with Denver Housing Authority [Denver Colorado], and we were able to obtain two HOPE VI grants for the community, from getting dumpsters replaced to getting roads paved to, I mean, a lot of different projects like that, yeah.
Speaker 1: You said HOPE VI grants.  Those helped to do what?
Speaker 2: Create housing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's basically a housing program where you could have Section 8 and market rate residents live in the, the same area, and you really, really wouldn't know the difference between the housing 'cause the house is the same.  It's just empowering and building the infrastructure in, in depressed neighborhoods.
Speaker 1: I see that all over the country happening, because at one point, housing projects, everybody, you know, everybody knew that it was a low income--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and everybody that lived there.  So, this was, this is a way of--
Speaker 2: This is a way of just incorporating--
Speaker 1: --incorporating--
Speaker 2: --new housing product, you know, for whether you're market rate or you're Section 8.  And so I was very, I'm very proud of a lot of those projects.  It was a lot of hard work.
Story_ID: 565153
Speaker 1: But also, I was able to get elected on leadership for city council [Denver City Council].  I was elected city council pro temp [pro tempore], and in 2003, I was elected city council president.
Speaker 2: And tell me what that was like.
Speaker 1: Well, in 2003, it was the--going to be the biggest turnover in city government here in Denver [Colorado] since like 1908 because of term limits.  We were going to have a total turnover.  So, we're gonna have a new mayor; ten out of thirteen council members were going to be new; new city auditor and two new (unclear) commissioners.  So there are only gonna be three council people that had--that were gonna be in office, and I was the one that had the most experience.  And so, we had to make sure the government kept on running and that we had these new people who would keep everything running smoothly.  So that cut fell to me in many ways.  And when I was elected council president, you know, I worked with our new mayor, John Hickenlooper, which was fascinating because remember, he's a business owner.  He had not had any experience in government at all, and so he just came in new.  He didn't have any clue.  And so--
Speaker 2: Who did he run against?
Speaker 1: He ran against Don Mares, who had been in government for like twenty years.  But it's a new, new change, that people wanted a new direction, and they liked his energy and his focus.  And so, and it was in- more interesting 'cause I supported Don Mares for (laughter) mayor.  So here's this woman who didn't support him, and, but he needed to count on me to help the government keep moving.  And so we decided that the one thing we did have in common is that we both loved Denver.  So we kind of built our working relationship from there, and it's been a very successful one.
Speaker 2: And so what happens next?  And what, what projects do you work on during this time?
Speaker 1: Well, during this time, I basically was able to name our new municipal office building in honor of Mayor Webb [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb], so it's the Wellington E. Webb Municipal Office Building [Denver, Colorado].  I was able to build a recreate- recreation center, a library, a golf course, club house.  There are lot of different projects that I can't name, you know, all of them.  But I wanted to keep a legacy in our community, which is important, in terms of African Americans and their, their contributions, but also build our, our infrastructure, you know, because I knew that northeast Denver was a viable district, but we had some poor neighborhoods.  But I wanted to make sure that they would get represented well, just as any other neighborhood within the city, and I think we were able to do that, to get the attention that they needed.
Story_ID: 565154
Speaker 1: Well, I know that you quoted Mandela [sic. Marianne Williamson].  Have you had the opportunity to go to South Africa?
Speaker 2: Yes, as a matter of fact I did.  A group of people from Denver [Colorado], about fourteen of us, we went for the tenth anniversary for the end of apartheid.  I think it was 2004.  And that was a great opportunity.  I'd never been to South Africa before.  And it's one of those once in a lifetime opportunities that you get and very memorable.  And the people were wonderful, and it was a great experience there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any, any stories about the travel?
Speaker 2: Well, I remember, you know, when I went there, Carl Buswa [ph.], who is a business owner here, he has a farm there.  And so he knows the people in government and other business leaders.  And so they had this celebration in this park.  We're talking thousands of people.  And they introduced these people from Denver.  It's like, these people from Denver came to visit you.  And these people just went berserk.  They were like yelling and screaming, and they were so happy that we were there.  And that was fun; that was a lot of fun (laughter).
Story_ID: 565155
Speaker 1: --Let me see, how long is your term?
Speaker 2: I was elected in December of '99 [1999], and my term ended in March of '07 [2007], so it was around eight years.
Speaker 1: In eight years, you accomplished--what was--what were you most proud of?
Speaker 2: I think I was most proud of facilities like this one [Blair-Caldwell African American Research Library, Denver, Colorado], you know, where it really honored the legacy and the progress of African Americans within the community, and that I was able to represent the community as a black woman but also as someone who was born and raised in this community.  The community is what made me who I am, and I never forgot that.  It's with me forever.  And it's because of where I've been able to go, that core of how I grew up in, you know, Curtis Park [Denver, Colorado] and Cole [Denver, Colorado] and graduated from Manual [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado], that basically is what created me in terms of my values in, in the core of who I am to be a, a leader in the community.  And I think that it's important you never forget where you come from, 'cause it makes you who you are.
Speaker 1: So after your term is over [on Denver City Council], did you think of running for another position?
Speaker 2: No, 'cause for me, I think that I wanted to run for office to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish.  I wanted to represent my community and, and have, you know, them have their voices heard and, and do some projects.  But then you always go to the next, you know, phase in your life.  And so I knew that I was gonna be leaving office 'cause I was term limited.  And one day I was in my council office, and I received this call from Dr. Patricia Gabow from Denver Health [Denver, Colorado].  And I had worked for her, you know, previously, and we still kept that relationship, and, and I always was very, you know, passionate about healthcare.  And she called me in my office one day and said you know, "Elbra [HistoryMaker Elbra Wedgeworth], we'd like for you to come back."  And I thought, wow, this is so much cool.  And so she said, "Well, we want you to be our leg- a legislative liaison on the local, state, and federal level and represent us."  And I thought, perfect, so I couldn't ask for anything more perfect.  And so I left office a month earlier just so I could take that break (laughter), you know, 'cause at that time I'd been in government close to twenty years in one capacity or another.  And so I was, you know, hired, appointed, and then elected, you know, went through all that.  And so I thought, now is my time to really think what I want my next phase in my life to be and wanted to dedicate my skills to healthcare and providing healthcare for underserved people in Denver [Colorado] metro area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's what I'm doing now.
Speaker 1: And how has the transition been from politics, per se, into--it's really like the private sector.
Speaker 2: Well, you prepare yourself.  I knew--like I remember telling my staff on October of '06 [2006], you know, I said you know, "I'm probably gonna be gone around March of '07 [2007].  So, you know, you guys, whatever I can do to help you or whatever, you need to start thinking about it."  So I was thinking about it months ahead of time, regardless of--I didn't even know what position I would get.  I just knew that I was going to have to do that, and I needed to move on, you know.  And that was important because whoever took my place, they needed to lead in their own way.
Story_ID: 565156
Speaker 1: But also time--also during that time, remember I was involved with the convention, the Democratic National Convention [2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver, Colorado], to bring it here.
Speaker 2: Okay, so tell me about that.
Speaker 1: Well (laughter)--
Speaker 2: How did you get involved (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Let's start there.  Let's start there.  How did you get involved?
Speaker 1: Well, I'd been thinking about the Democratic Convention for a while.  Denver [Colorado] had submitted bids before in 2000--2004, I think.  But we didn't have the infrastructure at the time.  We didn't have the hotel rooms.  We didn't have the convention center hotel--Convention Center [Colorado Convention Center, Denver, Colorado].  Pepsi Center [Denver, Colorado] had just been built around, you know, ten, twelve years ago.  I really started thinking about this in the fall of 2005, 'cause I thought, okay, we've got a new convention center hotel; we've got the Convention Center; we have all the infrastructure now.  It would be the hundredth anniversary since the last political convention was held in the Rocky Mountain West, which was in 1908 in Denver.  I thought, you know, this synergy just, is too much to pass up.  So I just took it upon myself, and I went to this reception.  Governor Howard Dean was elected the chair of the party at that time.  And I went to this reception where he was going to be at.  And something just made me raise my hand and say you know, "We've hosted World Youth Day, Summit of the Eight [23rd G8 Summit], the All-Star games [2005 NBA All-Star Game].  You know, if we can host the pope, you know, I think we can do this, you know.  What do you think?"  And he was like, "Well, the, the bid process starts in January '06 [2006].  If Denver is interested, they should apply."  And you know, 'cause usually these bids come from the mayor's office or the governor's office, whatever.  And I just decided, me and some of my friends, that we're gonna do this.  And we went to the mayor, asked him to submit an intent letter.  And when I first approached him about it--think about it--he had only been in office for two years.
Speaker 2: This was mayor--
Speaker 1: Mayor Hickenlooper [John Hickenlooper].  And I'm the council president.  And I go to him and say, "I want to be the--bring the largest convention in the history of the city to Denver."  And when I first approached him, he literally said you know, "You're sleeping; you need to wake up," (laughter).  Well, you know, as a woman--you know, no offense to your, your, your videotographer [sic. videographer] here, but when guys tell you that you couldn't or you shouldn't, you know, it makes you more determined as a woman to do it anyway.  And so I was like, look, you know, we've built this infrastructure.  We can pull it off.  I know we can raise the money.  We, we, we need to do this.  And so he consented.  And so we were one of thirty-five cities to submit an intent letter that we were interested to the DNC [Democratic National Committee].  And out of those thirty-five letters--thirty-five cities, eleven were asked to submit actual bid packages.  And so we put together, you know, a group of volunteers, businesspeople, people from the visitor's bureau, and we put together this bid package.  And it was like sixteen hundred pages and weighed like fifteen pounds.  It was like this big.  And this is a strictly volunteer effort.  I mean, I'm a full-time councilperson and doing all this stuff.  But I was so convinced that we were doing this for the right reasons and that we can do it, 'cause we felt that the pathway to the presidency was through the Rocky Mountains, 'cause we were changing politically, and we thought we could do this.  And we were raising some money, and some people literally thought I was nuts (laughter).  They thought you have lost it.  There's no way, that, that people are gonna think we're too small; we're not gonna be able to do it.  And so, we went from eleven cities to three: Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul [Minnesota], and New York [New York].  And then it went to two, because Minneapolis/St. Paul was picked by the RNC, the Republican National Committee.  So, here me, I'm the councilperson, council president, versus the mayor of New York [Michael Bloomberg].  You know, he's a billionaire too on top of everything else.  They're given six political conventions in a hundred years.  This will be our second, right.  But you know, it's that light I keep on telling you about.  We just kept on going.  We just like, we don't care what anybody says; we don't care what the mayor says (laughter); we're just gonna do it anyway.
Speaker 2: Did the mayor give you any support (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah.
Speaker 2: --once you got the bid--
Speaker 1: Oh, he did, he did.  But I tease him about it now, 'cause at first he, he literally thought it would not happen, you know.  And I'm like, I'm gonna prove to you that it will.  But he came with us on our bid visits and stuff, so he was very supportive.  But you know, he was kind of like thinking I'm not sure where this is gonna go, you know, but she's council president too, so, I mean, what am I gonna do?  So--
Story_ID: 565157
Speaker 1: Were your council members also on board?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were very--'cause the majority of our thirteen members [on the Denver City Council], twelve of them--eleven of them are Democrats, so they were like, "Yeah, go ahead, Elbra [HistoryMaker Elbra Wedgeworth]; yeah, we're, we're behind you."  And, but you know, the business community and everyone just started getting on board.  You know, nationally we were winning blog polls.  And people were saying, you know, "We don't want to go back to California.  We don't want to go back east.  You know, the Rocky Mountains kind of make sense to us.  It's part of the fifty states strategy with Dean [Howard Dean]."  And he really wanted to have it here too 'cause he thought it would be beneficial to the party.  But you know, people were concerned whether we would be able to raise the money 'cause we don't have a lot of Fortune 500 companies here.  And we were able to convince them that we--and this--our enthusiasm and excitement, I remember we had a, a party we hosted it for the DNC [Democratic National Committee] members in New Orleans [Louisiana].  And so we had like thirty-five Colorado, Denver people went to New Orleans.  And there, they were like, who are these Colorado people?  I mean we were just like yeah, you know, excited and happy and friendly.  And they're like, wow, you guys kind of like this all the time?  We're like, yeah.  You know, they're like, okay (laughter).  So we were just convincing people.  And I think we got the bid mostly because of our enthusiasm and excitement, and we wanted it more than anything, and we knew what it would mean for our city and our state.  And then January 12th of '07 [2007], I get a call in my office saying that we won the bid.
Speaker 1: And how exciting was that?
Speaker 2: Well, I can tell you I just started crying because I thought, you know, all the hopes and dreams and everything that we had been going through for that year, you know, it came out all at once.  And one of the first calls I got was from [HistoryMaker] Wellington Webb.  And he said you know, "I'm really proud of you 'cause I don't think you really understand what you've pulled off, you know, 'cause nobody thought you would do, be able to do this, you know."  And he said, "But you need to stop crying 'cause I think people are gonna start calling you in a minute," (laughter), you know.  And, and then Mayor Hickenlooper [John Hickenlooper] called me, and he's like, you know, "I never should have doubted you, but I'm on board, so, yay," (laughter), you know.  And so, you know, we were able--I was president and chair of the board of the host committee.  And it's, and that was comprised of Senator Salazar [Kenneth Salazar], Congresswoman DeGette [Diana DeGette], Governor Ritter [Bill Ritter], Mayor Hickenlooper, and Steve Farber [Steven W. Farber].  And so I was the president of the host committee and chairman of the board.  And so the staff would report to me, and, and we ended up raising about in between cash and kind we ended up raising about $60 million.  And we finally got an economic benefit report that it benefited the Denver metro area by $255 million.  And so, just for putting yourself out there, believing in what you're doing, and, and believing in the right thing, you know, things just kind of fell into place.  You know, we didn't let any of the circumstances define us.  We just defined ourselves and kept on going despite what anybody said and 'cause we, we knew that we could really put Denver on the map internationally, and I think that's what's happened.
Speaker 1: And it has.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 565158
Speaker 1: So now you have the bid.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So now walk me through the process to get us to August to '0--'08 [2008] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well we basically worked in conjunction with the Democratic National Convention Committee.  And they moved into town.  And what was so exciting about that is, you know, here I am, you know, this home girl from Denver [Colorado], and Leah Daughtry [Leah D. Daughtry], the sister is from Brooklyn [New York] (laughter), you know, and so here are these two black women running this convention [2008 Democratic National Convention, Denver, Colorado] basically.  And you know, so we ended up having a staff of twenty plus people working for us.  We're raising money.  We're, you know, making arrangements for the Pepsi Center [Denver, Colorado], you know.  So, and, and then we had a brutal primary, which I don't wanna wish on my worst enemy ever again.  (Laughter) That was just horrible between Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] and Clinton [Hillary Rodham Clinton].  And try to raise money during that is just like almost impossible.  But we raised the money, made our contractual goal, but it was tough; it was tough.  And, and then when Obama got the nomination, and I thought, who would have believed that this brother would be making his speech for pres- would be a nominee for president in Denver, Colorado?  (Laughter) You know, nobody would ever believe something like that.  And then when he switched his nomination speech to Invesco Field [Invesco Field at Mile High; Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Denver, Colorado] where the Broncos [Denver Broncos] play, in which would make it the largest convention speech, you know--
Speaker 1: Did you have anything to do with that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what, when we did submit the bid, we had thought about Invesco 'cause we know that Howard Dean had thought about having it in a stadium.  But when I contacted the Broncos, you know, this was like two years out.  They're like, "Well, we don't know what the preseason schedule is gonna be and you know, so we can't, you know," the Broncos were like, you know, "you just don't do that," (laughter), you know.  And so, we support your bid, but we can't commit to that right now.  So once Obama received the nomination, they looked into it again.  They were able to move the CU/CSU [University of Colorado Boulder and Colorado State University] game off to another weekend and have it there.  And so, to bring, you know, the world to your city and to have for the first time, you know, many African Americans, first time they ever been to Denver.  You know, they probably thought, you know, we're still riding down the street on horses and you know, all this kind of stuff and that there are African Americans that live here.  I remember the funny story is Pras with the Fugees.  I ran into him somewhere, and he was saying how beautiful our city was.  And he's like, "But you all don't have any black folks here."  And I said, "We'll we're working on it," (laughter).  But people just really had a good time.  They thought--they said how friendly people were and just made you feel proud, it really did.

Speaker 1: Well, there are actually quite a few.  You alluded to Madam C.J. Walker as coming from Denver [Colorado].  But there are, there are some other very famous or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, we have very--a lot of well known people.  It's kind of surprising when people find out, you know, that folks are from Denver, like Chauncey Billups, who's with Detroit Pistons, grew up here.  Pam Grier grew up here, the actress.  Don Cheadle grew up here.  Philip Bailey, the lead singer for Earth, Wind and Fire--
Speaker 1: Wind and Fire.
Speaker 2: --grew up here.  So I think when people start--you tell people, they're like, what?  (Laughter) I was like (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Hattie McDaniel--Daniel--
Speaker 2: Hattie McDaniel--
Speaker 1: --Daniels, okay (unclear)--
Speaker 2: --yeah, she grew up here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you know, we have a, a really, like I said, long legacy and, and, and im- important legacy in Denver in the African American community.
Story_ID: 565160
Speaker 1: It was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I'm glad, you know, my role in it, you know, as small as it was--
Speaker 2: Why do you say it was small?  Because it seems like it would be a very huge part--
Speaker 1: Well, the, the thing about it is what's so unusual, is I remember, 'cause at that point, you know, when the DNC [Democratic National Committee] came out, and they said, "Well, what do you do?"  And I'm like, "I'm a councilperson."  And they're like, "What?  You know, you're doing all--no, no, no, you gotta hire an executive, a CEO, or something," you know.  And like I said this is a strictly grassroots effort.  It didn't come from the mayor's office or the governor's office.  So, Howard Dean was kind of like, you know, this, you could--governor [Bill Ritter] or mayor [John Hickenlooper], you guys are gonna kind of get involved in this thing, right, and help raise money and (laughter) stuff like that?  So it's just kind of different, 'cause I wasn't elected at that point, once I got term limited, so--which is very unusual.  So I'm president and chair of the board, and people on the host committee are all elected officials.  And so that was kind of an interesting thing (laughter).  Steve [Steven W. Farber] said, he's like, "You're the only one that kept, kept us all in line anyway," so.  So my role, when I say it's--compared to, you know, him get--Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] getting nominated and now being president, you know, that's, that's much more significant than, than what we did.  I mean, that was the ultimate goal, was to have a nom- have the president, you know, which now we do.
Story_ID: 565161
Speaker 1: So, now what, what's next?
Speaker 2: What's next for me is working at Denver Health [Denver, Colorado].  I really enjoy that.  And I also was appointed to the Union Station, Denver Union Station Authority [Denver Union Station Project Authority].  We are be redeveloping Union Station [Denver Union Station, Denver, Colorado] as our main helm for transportation for the western--excuse me--western region, and so I'm chairing that authority port, working on various nonprofits, you know, getting off the radar screen a little bit politically, you know, just kind of reevaluating, you know, spending more time with my family and my friends and, and on my own privately, you know, kind of cap- recapturing my life back.
Speaker 1: Are you married?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, any children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But that's a choice I made, no children, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's, I mean, that's--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 1: --absolutely fine.
Speaker 2: Well, sometimes it's like, you know, I think, you know, my choice was I put my emphasis on my career.  And I--and that's a, a choice that I was satisfied to make.  And it's, it's benefitted me.  Public life has been one of the best things that's ever happened to me, so.
Speaker 1: Well, that's, that's great.
Story_ID: 565162
Speaker 1: Just to go back a little bit to Denver Health [Denver, Colorado], and you wanted to go back and make a difference in healthcare, and that's a big issue, even during the campaign.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What do you hope to accomplish there?
Speaker 2: Well, I hope that we accomplish nat- a national plan for healthcare, for everyone to be insured on, whether if you--we have a basic plan, and people can have the basic plan or if you have more money, if you want to have a dif- another plan that's an enhancement to that, fine.  But every man, woman, and child in the United States is covered in somew- way, shape or form.  I think that's my ultimate goal and especially those that are underserved in our communities, 'cause right now, you know, people that are poor, homeless, working poor, I mean, they're, they're struggling.  It's tough, and, and we don't want their healthcare to be bringing folks into the emergency room.  We want preventive care for people.  We want strategic care for people and whether you're a baby or whether you're a senior.  So, that's the goal for me.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you--well, first, is there anything that you want to talk about that we did not talk about?
Speaker 2: Well, I just wanted to say again that, you know, the reason why I've been able to make this journey has been because of, you know, how I began and my background, the, the community I grew up with, you know, the people I grew up around, my family, you know, and that's what makes you who you are, you know.  And you, you take that with you regardless of where you go.  And so I'm very thankful for that, 'cause it's, it's what keeps you focused, but it's also what grounds you.  And no matter the highest successes or the lowest of lows, you know, it keeps you really centered in terms of who you are as an individual, and I'm very thankful for that.
Speaker 1: Well, tell me, what, what are your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: I think that we really need to--
Story_ID: 565163
Speaker 1: What are your concerns for the African American community?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's very important, especially with the recent election of Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], that we have to really appreciate and honor the road we've come as African American people and how much more further we need to go.  I mean, it's, it's--his election has been the hallmark of a lot of our struggle and accomplishments.  But we still have a lot of issues we have to deal with in terms of economics, healthcare, crime in our community.  And I want younger people now to, to understand that legacy but, but move on and improve, you know, our, our quality of life as a community, and just not think that Obama, because he's president, is gonna solve all of our ills.  You know, he has to be president for everyone, and that's why he got elected.  And, but as a community, we have to keep centered and focused in terms of, you know, how we want our, our, our people to succeed, because there's so many people that sacrificed so many to get us to this point.  I mean, I never thought I'd see an African American president, but you know, maybe ten years from now we might see a, an African American woman be president, you know, we see African Americans now running Fortune 500 companies.  So, I mean I think it's important to, to still keep your eyes on the prize as a further goal, not just be satisfied with what you have or settle for things when we can do so much better.
Story_ID: 565164
Speaker 1: Because this interview is going to be inspiring and encouraging for many future generations, what message would you like to send to future generations?
Speaker 2: I'd like to say that, you know, the, sometimes the road is not really, you know, a, a good one.  There's gonna be a lot of stops and starts, ups and downs, but it's worth every step.  It has--'cause it, it defines who you are.  And, and it makes you stronger, and it makes you, you clear on what's important for yourself and for other people.  And, you know, I wouldn't change my life at all.  I mean, it wasn't the road I chose (laughter), but I was prepared to take it, and I'm thankful for that.
Story_ID: 565165
Speaker 1: So when you look over your life, you said that you wouldn't change anything, but is there something that you have not done that you would like to do?
Speaker 2: Well, you look back and you say to yourself, well, you know, marriage, kids, you know, when I was a little girl I wanted to marry [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte, but that didn't happen (laughter).  I, I, I think that you also use that to your advantage.  You know, you, you can't regret.  You have to learn from your mistakes and move on.  You have to learn from all of your regrets, and, and I think that it just makes you stronger.  It, it, it really just says that you can achieve anything you set your mind to, if your mind is strong enough to accomplish it.  And I think that's what Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] said.  You know, I came from nothing, basically, you know.  And when people told you you could be nothing, you're not gonna amount to anything, you come from this community, you know, nothing's--you're not gonna, you're just gonna be here for the rest of your life, and you use that.  And you basically, you know, accomplish a lot of things.  And for me it's been more how to benefit Denver in Colorado and make it a better place for my community and just at large for other people.  And that's basically been my mission.  And, and I continue on that path, and that's what really makes me happy, you know.
Story_ID: 565166
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: That, you know, I'm just a home girl, east Denver [Colorado].  That's who I am, will be until the day I die, (laughter) basically, but that I've never forgotten where I came from, and that I'm very, very proud of that, and that regardless of what I do, do or where I go, that's always gonna be the core of what do, it's don't--you remember the people that--you remember where you came from, but you also remember those people there, and you have to bring them up along with you, you know.  There's a lot of, you know, brothers and sisters throughout this country that are struggling every day, facing things that we would never even imagine that we would be facing, but we can't forget that.  You know, we have to empower everybody, not just some people.  We have to make life better for a lot, everybody.
Story_ID: 565167
Speaker 1: Now legacy, what you would like your legacy to be and how you want to be remembered actually are two different questions.  So, what do you want people to say about you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About me?  That she was, she worked hard, and that she did the best she could, and that she always kept her word, and that she, you know, she basically wanted what was best for everybody in her community, and that, you know, I, I think it's important that people understand that you are--you have the public life, and you have the public life.  You know, sometimes, you know, I'm a very private person, but I have a very public life.  You know, a lot of people don't understand that the Elbra [HistoryMaker Elbra Wedgeworth] that most, most of my family and friend know is very quiet, you know, homebody, whatever.  And then my public life, people see me, you know, on TV, and they see me at different meetings or whatever, it's, it's a, a duality is that you have to kind of put together sometimes.  And, and some people don't understand that 'cause they--when you're at home and you're at Safeway [Safeway Inc.] and you don't have any makeup and they're like, "Is that, are you Elbra Wedgeworth," (laughter)?  You're like, yeah (laughter), you know.  You're, you're not, sometimes you, you, you're not on all the time, you know.
Story_ID: 565168
Speaker 1: Is there anything else that you'd like to tell us or share with us?
Speaker 2: No, I just think it's very important.  I mean, as African Americans we've lost so much of our history.  And that's why I think these types of programs are so important, that people a hundred years from now can say, you know, it's not really who I was, but you know, just basically what was happening during that time, you know.  What was the road that that woman traveled to get from here to there?  To, to me that's just as important as anything else, and--
Speaker 1: And that, and that's why this library [Blair-Caldwell African American Research Library, Denver, Colorado] stands.
Speaker 2: That's why this library stands.  Because the two people specifically that we honor for this library, they basically cleared a road that I was able to travel to get where I am, you know, and made it much more tenable for me to just kind of succeed.  You know, because Elvin Caldwell [Elvin R. Caldwell] was our first African American representative on city council [Denver City Council].  Omar Blair was our first, you know--he was, he was our second African American on the school board, first African--first male.  And you know, they dedicated their lives to the community, you know, and very proud of that.
Speaker 1: Well, I want to thank you for taking time out of your very busy schedule to--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter) especially today, day after the election--yay, Obama [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] (laughter).
Speaker 1: But we thank you very much for, for sharing your story, because it will be an inspiration and encouragement for very many generations to come.
Speaker 2: Well, thank you very much for the opportunity, appreciate it.
