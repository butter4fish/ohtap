Speaker 1: My name is Larry Crowe; I'm interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is Matthew Hickey.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Jon Onye Lockard, J-O-N, O-N-Y-E, L-O-C-K-A-R-D
Speaker 1: How did you get the name Onye or is Jon your given name, is that your full first name?
Speaker 2: No I changed my name.  My parents [Lillian Jones Lockard and Cecil Lockard] come from the South.  My birth name was Johnny, I had to grow up at some point but Onye came from a Nigerian family, in fact the family--the Mbanefo family gave me that name.  Arthur Mbanefo who is now the ambassador to the United Nations [UN] from Nigeria but I met them about thirty/thirty-five years ago and we developed a friendship and he called his father and told him about the friendship that he had developed and his father said that his name should be Onye Ije.  See Arthur had traveled with me around to a couple of art exhibitions and Onye Ije really means artistic traveler who has many friends and I liked that.  That was a name that fit me and when I met people from the continent I would often say my name is Onye and they would light up right away.  They knew right away what that meant, Jon nobody knows what that means so that's how I accepted that name and I've used it ever since.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell that family's last name?
Speaker 2: M-B-A-N-E-F-O, Mbanefo from Nigeria.
Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born January 25, 1932 in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 1: Sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I'm a painter; I'm an educator, professor here at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and at Washtenaw Community College [Ann Arbor, Michigan] both in the Ann Arbor [Michigan] region.
Speaker 1: What is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is 19th I think, January 19, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We are on the campus of the University of Michigan in South Quad Dormitory [South Quadrangle] in the Ambatana Lounge which is the African American students' lounge this is where I teach my classes also.

Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth there are five lightweight People magazine type questions that I'm compelled to ask you, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: You want a lightweight People magazine answer (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah right, a lightweight answer too.  The first one is, sir what is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color? I don't think I have a favorite color, I enjoy color, I enjoy color very much but I don't think I have one particular favorite color, I really don't.
Speaker 1: Okay now do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes the kind of food that I shouldn't be eating fried chicken, sea food I enjoy very much.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Yes spring, summer and fall.  I like it warm, I like to see things begin and I like to see things just before they make that transition.
Speaker 1: Now do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I would have if I took vacations.  I've never had a vacation in my life even though I've traveled all over but I'm always working.  So I don't really have a place that I go to vacation.
Speaker 1: The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I've got a lot of them.  A favorite phrase--can we come back to that a little later?
Speaker 1: Right we can come back to it.
Speaker 2: Something will come right now I just blanked out.
Story_ID: 244941
Speaker 1: I want to ask you something about your family history.  And I realize you're not Alex Haley (laughter).  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [Cecil Lockard], but we'll start with your mother's side.
Speaker 2: Yeah I know a little more about my mother's side of the family, she had a large family.
Speaker 1: Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes Lillian Louvenia was her middle name, L-O-U-V-E-N-I-A-do you want her maiden name?
Speaker 1: Yes
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Jones.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Port Arthur, Mississippi [ph.] on February 18, 1908.
Speaker 1: Now how far back can you trace the family tree on that side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well my grandmother who died when I was about twelve, her name was Isabella [ph.].  She came from Mississippi also, that's as much as I know.  My grandfather who died when I was an infant, I never knew him I've just seen pictures of him.  But he too came from that Mississippi region but I don't know exactly where.
Speaker 1: It wasn't necessarily the same town, it wasn't Port Arthur?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily the same town.  They then moved to Arkansas, they moved to Dermott, Arkansas when my mother was very young and there were twelve children in my mother's family.  Two females and the rest males, in fact the aunt [Harriet B. Jones] that I was speaking to you about before was her sister.  She passed away last year--what, two years ago 2002, and she still has one remaining brother still alive who lives in Chicago [Illinois] and he's ninety-eight.  So they, most of 'em--
Speaker 1: So that's Marion Jones [ph.].
Speaker 2: That's Marion Jones, right.
Story_ID: 244942
Speaker 1: Now let me, before we leave your mother's [Lillian Jones Lockard] side (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: --let me just ask you, if there are any stories that were passed down through your mother's side of the family about life when she was growing up, or life in the 19th century even, when her mother [Isabella Jones (ph.)] was growing up in the latter part of the 19th century?  Are there any stories that they talked about, did they talk about slavery or sharecropping or any of the--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No they didn't talk about that very much.  My mother went to Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  Her sister went to Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi], the brothers they were spread out over a lot of years.  In fact she and this brother [Marion Jones (ph.)] in Chicago [Illinois] were the youngest of the group.  Many of her brothers were full grown men and they were in their twenties and thirties when she was born.  I would only hear very distant stories about them.  I did have--two of her brothers lived in Detroit [Michigan] and were part of my upbringing.  One of them used to talk quite a bit to us when we were kids.  He was the first one really to introduce me to the importance of accumulating knowledge about African American history and he used to talk to us a lot when we were kids up until his death.  I have to say out of all of my relatives on both sides that one uncle is the one that really embedded in me certain ideas and thoughts about not only who we were but the significance of some things.
Speaker 1: Now who was that uncle?
Speaker 2: Robert Jones [ph.] that's Robert Jones in fact on that invitation that I gave you that's his picture on there.
Speaker 1: Okay so we've got Harriet [B.] Jones is your aunt, Marion Jones is your uncle, Robert Jones an uncle.  Two of them settled in Chicago, Robert was here?
Speaker 2: No more than two were in Chicago.  Peyton Jones [ph.] that was another one, he worked at the post office and was an outstanding mason in Chicago, a (unclear) mason.  Robert Jones was in Detroit but also a Jeffrey Jones [ph.] and interestingly enough one thing that I'm sure impressed me was almost all of them that I knew about or heard about were in business for themselves or had some kind of business going somewhere you know.  I think that had an impact on my own upbringing just based on things that I eventually ended up doing.
Story_ID: 244943
Speaker 1: Now we talked about this off camera but Harriet [B.] Jones you said was the first black professor at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  Now this is--your family is a kind of educated group--fairly well-educated group.
Speaker 2: Some of them were--some of them definitely were.
Speaker 1: As far as you know did it start like--where did it start?  Did it start with your grandmother [Isabella Jones (ph.)] or did it start with that group of children?
Speaker 2: I think as best as I can understand it started with my grandfather's intent that his children would be educated.  Now I don't know anything about the education of some of the older men, I don't know anything about their educational background.  In fact a couple of them were dead when I was coming up but those that were alive when I came up most of them were involved in something on one level or the other.
Speaker 1: So Harriet Jones graduated you said from Tougaloo [College, Tougaloo, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Tougaloo right in fact when I was a kid that's the first time I ever heard of Tougaloo, I didn't know what that was but she was quite outstanding in Chicago [Illinois] over a long period of time.  She had a travel agency [International Travelers Association] and her most outstanding client was Johnson Publication [Johnson Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois], she worked with the Johnsons.  I've seen a lot of pictures of her in old Ebony magazines and so forth.  My uncle was involved in the construction business in Chicago that's Marion [Jones (ph.)].  My uncle in Detroit [Michigan] was involved in automobile repair business, he had bump shop and Jeffrey [Jones (ph.)] was what we used to call a coal man, he used to delivery coal.  He had a big truck and he delivered coal when people used to have coal furnaces.  All of them kind of independently worked at something.
Speaker 1: Was Marion related to Clayvon Jones [ph.] in Chicago that's a black contractor who built the eta theater [eta Creative Arts Foundation, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No and he only had one son who died in an accident and he was twelve/thirteen years old.  So he and his wife only had one son.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, this seems like quite an active family.
Speaker 2: They were; they definitely were.
Story_ID: 244944
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask you a couple more questions about your mother [Lillian Jones Lockard].  We're going to get to your father [Cecil Lockard] but did she grow up in Dermott, Arkansas (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Dermott, Arkansas, yes she did up until the time she went away to school.  She went to--actually she went to Detroit [Michigan] first and went to Commerce High School [The High School of Commerce, Detroit, Michigan] in Detroit and then went to Hampton [Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: How do you spell Dermott?
Speaker 2: Dermott was D-E-R-M-O-T-T
Speaker 1: Okay I've got it.  So she went to Hampton what did she pursue as a career?
Speaker 2: She didn't graduate, she didn't graduate.  I think she was there two years and I don't know.  As I was growing up she had a lot of small jobs in small retail businesses.  She was working retail businesses women's clothing like Winkelman's and things like that she worked in.  Up until my father died, my father died in 1965 and then I had her--I brought her up here to Ann Arbor [Michigan] with me and I would have her work as a receptionist in my art studio until she couldn't work anymore.
Speaker 1: Now did she come to Chicago [Illinois] to stay with her aunts or uncles?
Speaker 2: No Detroit [Michigan] was her place.
Speaker 1: I mean not Chicago yeah--how did she come to Detroit?  Did she have relatives here already?
Speaker 2: Yeah she had two brothers here (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Those were your aunts and uncles I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Right my--her mother was ill she had a stroke and so they brought her here to Detroit also and her father who is also sick came here and he died as I said when I was an infant here in Detroit and my grandmother [Isabella Jones (ph.)] lived till I was about twelve--eleven or twelve and she died here in Detroit too but those two brothers were taking care of her.  So it ended up with three of them being here in Detroit.  Three were in Detroit and three were in Chicago, the others they were all gone and dead by then.
Story_ID: 244945
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My father's full name was Cecil Emery Lockard.
Speaker 1: How do you spell it?
Speaker 2: C-E-C-I-L, E-M-E-R-Y, L-O-C-K-A-R-D
Speaker 1: What is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1900, September 15 and he was born in Marianna, Arkansas.
Speaker 1: Marianna, Arkansas I've heard that name before many times and I can't think of all the significances.  I think there was like a horrible lynching there once and some other things.  So what do you know about your relatives on that side?  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Not too far.  My dad had two brothers.  One died of TB [tuberculosis] when he was a teenager the other one Henry he came to Detroit [Michigan] also and my grandmother and grandfather came to Detroit from Memphis, Tennessee.  They had gone from Arkansas to Memphis, Tennessee and then they came to Detroit from there.  When my grandfather came here he was sick and he passed away.  I have very little memory of him but he passed away when I was maybe eight or nine years old.  His name was Henry [ph.].  My grandmother her name was Martha [Lockard], I don't know her maiden name.  She lived until--she died in the early '50s [1950s].  I don't know the exact year, I have to guess and I would say '55 [1955], I'd say '55 [1955] she died in Detroit [Michigan].  My father went to Arkansas State College [First District Agricultural School; Arkansas State University, Jonesboro, Arkansas].  He did not graduate; he stayed there a couple of years.  My mother [Lillian Jones Lockard] was his second wife, his first wife passed away early and he had one son by her then he married my mother and that one son is my half-brother [Cecil Lockard Ypsilanti] who is still alive, yeah.
Speaker 1: What did your father do for a living?
Speaker 2: My father worked at Ford [Motor Company] in the foundry up until I'm going to guess and say up until I was seven or eight years old and then he worked for the Detroit Street--it was called the DSI [sic. Detroit Department of Street Railways (DSR)] then, I think they call it DOT [Detroit Department of Transportation (DDOT)] now and he drove street cars and buses in Detroit until he retired.
Speaker 1: Alright are there any stories from that side of the family about--that were passed down you know that you remember?
Speaker 2: Not really his father was a carpenter, in fact my uncle was a carpenter also again that independent thing you know but not really.  One of the things that I might mention about my family on both sides is there were not very many siblings and so there's not much carrying on to a whole lot of people.  In fact, in terms of cousins and all that kind of thing, I don't have any that I know about anyway.  So stories, not really from my father's side there weren't very many stories.  He was also an amateur photographer.
Speaker 1: Did he develop his own prints and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: Yeah he had a little dark room in the house that he developed his own prints and belonged to-there was a club in Detroit of African American men who were all amateur photographers back in the '50s [1950s] and so forth that he belonged to.
Speaker 1: Do any of his photographs survive; do you still have some of the photos?
Speaker 2: A few, a few, yeah.
Story_ID: 244946
Speaker 1: Now did anybody on that side of the family ever talk about why they left Marianna, Arkansas?
Speaker 2: Not to my recollection.  First of all my father [Cecil Lockard] had a physical setback in the early '60s [1960s] and so the last ten years of his life he was quite ill.  He died in '65 [1965] and his brother died in '67 [1967] there was nobody to talk to.  In fact, ironically I say ironically because his brother took care of his mother [Martha Lockard] my grandmother they lived in the same home and my grandmother died around '55 [1955] then he and his wife were really the holders of stuff from that side of the family, photographs and et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  He died two years after my father died.  His wife then as far as our family is concerned disappeared and with her everything from that side of the family I've never seen or heard from her since.  Somebody said something about she had gotten married again or something and so literally that half of the family drop off into space.  You can see how old I was at that time, I got married early and it was just a lot of things I couldn't pursue.  So that was the end of that.  Interestingly enough by the same token when my aunt [Harriet B. Jones] died in Chicago [Illinois], I had mentioned before that I had to go and clear out her apartment and we found all kinds of stuff that we kept.  I'm going to have to go through there with my uncle now 'cause his house is so full of papers it's unbelievable, I'm dreading the time when it comes but the responsibilities are on me so I'm going to have to deal with it.  I'm sure there will be a lot of information.  I've tried to talk to him verbally to get him to tell me about certain things but you can only go so far.  So incidents like why they left Tennessee--very frankly I got the feeling that they left--my father's family, my mother [Lillian Jones Lockard] and father left Memphis [Tennessee] because my father and my uncle were up here and they had jobs.  They were getting older, they were both sick and in that period of time is different than today, people took care of their own.  That was their job to do that, they didn't have assisted living and senior citizens' residences and all that kind of stuff.  So you know they all came here.  I think that's why they came here.
Story_ID: 244947
Speaker 1: Well in terms of your father [Cecil Lockard] and your uncle coming here from--they started in [Marianna] Arkansas and then he went to school.  Did he come directly to Detroit [Michigan] after school?
Speaker 2: My father did well no he got married to someone else and they lived in New Jersey.  When he came to Detroit his first wife had passed away and he came here to work as was the fact of so many African American people during the '30s [1930s], late '20s [1920s] and '30s [1930s].  Jobs were here so he came here to work.
Speaker 1: Well Detroit was a magnet anybody who wanted to get a good job--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well see my Uncle Robert [Jones (ph.)] and my Uncle Jeffrey [Jones (ph.)] were already here then.  My Uncle Robert came to Detroit before the First World War [World War I, WWI].  He gave me a lot of history of Detroit that I didn't know and he gave me a sense of understanding which is almost another discussion but about a whole lot of things out of the dynamics of the social and economic and political life of Detroit I got from him.
Speaker 1: Now your Uncle Robert sounds like an interesting person (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a very interesting guy.
Speaker 1: What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He had a bump shop.  He had changed his garage into a shop and in fact he used to--his primary customers was the police department and he did police cars all the time.  They used to bump cars out then and one of the things that was extremely interesting almost--well most of the time we would go by there on the weekends--I'm saying we me and my brother [Cecil Lockard Ypsilanti] for years we'd go by there.  We didn't always want to go by there 'cause he'd always talked to us and you know kids don't want to be talked to.  But my mother [Lillian Jones Lockard] would say go by there and we'd go by there every Saturday and we know that we went to see him he would always give us a quarter.  A quarter was a lot of money for a kid then.  So my first sense of even an allowance came from him but I mention that because almost every Saturday when we went by there, we'd walk there 'cause he just lived about a mile from our house there would always be neighborhood men there sitting on those old crates sitting around there talking and he was holding court.
Story_ID: 244948
Speaker 1: So we were talking about the barbershop and other places where adults would gather.  But sir, do you have an earliest childhood memory, like a first childhood memory?
Speaker 2: About what, I've got a whole lot of memories?
Speaker 1: Well the first one, the first time that you remember that you came into consciousness and remember something, is there an earliest one?  Some people have and some people can't remember.
Speaker 2: I can't put my finger on any one I mean if it was about this or about that then I could tie something into it you know but just generically my earliest childhood memory (whistles) got a lot of them.
Speaker 1: Well tell me how many people comprised your household when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay myself, my father [Cecil Lockard], my brother [Cecil Lockard Ypsilanti] and my mother [Lillian Jones Lockard].  My brother came into the house when he was seven.  My first years he was not there I guess I was four because he's three years older than I.
Speaker 1: Okay so he was the one that was born in New Jersey?
Speaker 2: Yes and his grandmother was raising him and he was brought into our home when he was seven and again as I said I was four.
Speaker 1: So did your grandparents ever live with you? Any of your grandparents (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No. No. No.
Story_ID: 244949
Speaker 1: What part of Detroit [Michigan] did you live in?
Speaker 2: East side, right on the edge of what is popularly now called Black Bottom.
Speaker 1: Well it used to be, that whole section has been eradicated hasn't it like changed?  They've plowed it all under, right?
Speaker 2: Totally gone, totally gone now they've got condos and stuff in that area now but (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So what street did you live on?
Speaker 2: I lived on a street called Arndt Street.  I spent my first twelve years there and it was A-R-N-D-T.  Our neighborhood was not totally black, our neighborhood was Italians, Syrians, southern whites, Polish and blacks and the thing that they all had in common and most of the people from the Italians and the Polish were first generation many of them just came over and the thing that they had most in common was everybody was poor.  That's a first memory that I can think of you know living in our community and people got along.  The big change started after the riots in 1941--first riots of 1941 [sic. 1943] I remember that and then 1945 the end of the Second World War [World War II, WWII] and then it was the beginning of the suburbs.  There was only one suburb and that was still--well there were three I'm sorry but all of them were in Detroit.  There was Dearborn [Michigan]; there was Hamtramck [Michigan] and Highland Park [Michigan].  Hamtramck and Highland Park are encompassed in but after the war the [U.S.] military started coming back and that's when people started moving out because before then the housing was--people lived on top of each other.  They had those covenants where people could not move out of certain areas and then African Americans were like on islands.  You had the east side which was down by the [Detroit] River which was Black Bottom, you had a little small island on the north end, you had a little small island on the west side and you had a little small island southwest and that was it.  Eventually that begins to move out and expand.  So I was--I spent my first twelve years on Arndt Street and then we moved a little further east.  I went to Eastern High School [Detroit, Michigan].  I graduated from Eastern High School which was Coleman Young's school.
Story_ID: 244950
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up [in Detroit, Michigan]?
Speaker 2: Very international, very international.  When I say first generation I meant first generation.  The Italians had a tremendous impact on the little community that I had--that I lived in.  In that they spoke a lot of Italian--Sicilian.  I remember clearly teenage boys used to have BB guns and on the weekends they would shoot sparrows.  I remember seeing sparrows laid out on the grill like that and the old ladies they would all dress in black and everything.  They would clean them and they'd eat them and that was the first time I'd ever seen people eat dandelion greens.  They would eat dandelion greens and sparrows 'cause we ate collard greens and stuff like that and we wouldn't dare eat any of those sparrows but (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now that's unusual (unclear).
Speaker 2: That's an early memory of mine of seeing on the weekends those people have those grills out.  When I say grills I shouldn't even say grills.  They'd have like a wash basin that they would put coals and stuff in and put like a wire grill that came out of a stove or something and they'd stretch out those sparrows.  Man they'd shoot sparrows and eat sparrows and they'd eat squirrels also if they could catch them.  Now the black men in the neighborhood would go hunting and they'd get coons [raccoons] and possums and things like that.  The Italian men would make wine every winter around Thanksgiving they'd start making wine.  They'd make white wine, the black men would make red wine and there would be a lot of drunken people in the neighborhood around the holidays.  As kids we were never allowed to drink but we would watch them do it you know those kinds of things.  What kind of smells?  I don't remember smells.  Sounds I remember Polish being spoken also on weekends because they had a hall like a--it was a hall it wasn't a community center but it was like a dance hall that they would rent out.  They would have weddings and Polish weddings were legendary see because we were kind of close to Hamtramck [Michigan] and a lot of Polish people lived in that area and they would really, really dance and party up into the night.  We could hear it all over the neighborhood.  Because of the time and because of the kind of housing people lived in then so you would hear a lot of arguing, a lot of men and women arguing.  I remember that so clearly and developed an attitude about it and I don't like to argue today.  It just seems as though there was always an argument in the community.  Now people didn't have--people wasn't shooting each other or that kind of thing but there was a lot of arguing back and forth between families, between husbands and wives.
Story_ID: 244951
Speaker 1: It was a period of time, when the kids did something wrong, people in the neighborhood [in Detroit, Michigan] felt completely comfortable with chastising those kids which meant spanking them and if you got a spanking by the neighbor you can bet your life when you get home you're going to get another spanking because you got a spanking from the neighbor.  If you got a spanking in school, teachers used to spank you then and they carried little sticks and what do they call those things--those switches, what's the plant with the little cotton looking--oh God I can't--how could I forget that (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) A willow switch
Speaker 1: Willow a willow that's not the name, I can't think of it, it don't matter but anyway they would give you a switching down in a minute and I don't mean they call your parents, I mean you'd get it right there and when you go home your family knew about it, your mother knew about it and then you'd get it again.  So there was a lot of that kind of thing that was going on that I can clearly remember.  Many families in my immediate community were families coming up from the South.  It was commonplace then that one person would come up and get a job and then they start bringing in the rest from down south.  So at one minute a flat may have ten/twelve people living there.  You slept on pallets on the floor.  No such thing as your room.  The first time I had a room was when we first moved, I guess I was thirteen then; the first time I had a room of my own.  Me and my brother [Cecil Lockard Ypsilanti] slept on a couch.  Those kinds of memories but some reason I can't remember smells, sounds definitely.
Speaker 2: Could you smell any of the factories around there or (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No factories they weren't that--that's not true we had a factory a block and a half away from our house.  There were a lot of little small factories; tool and dye places all over town.  They didn't necessarily put out a smell, they put out a sound, I don't remember a smell necessarily.
Story_ID: 244952
Speaker 1: What did you like to do when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Draw (laughter).  I loved to draw and I was fortunate in that my parents [Lillian Jones Lockard and Cecil Lockard] never stopped me from drawing.  They let me mess up the living room.  Everything was in a small--we were living in a two and a half room apartment so as long as I cleaned it up.  I would draw and I'd make my Lear [Learjet] planes and I liked to run and play and ride my bike and I was fortunate in that--I mean now as I look back I was very fortunate in that there were four other boys within a three block radius of where we lived that also liked to draw and could draw very well.  That within itself was a kind of a support system.  You didn't feel like somebody weird because you did that.
Speaker 1: So you all knew each other?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah we all knew each other.  We all knew each other and there was a community center within a block and a half/two blocks from my house The Franklin [Wright] Settlement [Franklin Wright Settlements, Detroit, Michigan] and that gave us someplace to draw and athletics and all kinds of things came out of there.  In fact that Franklin Settlement was also the place that bred not only a lot of art but art, athletics and music.  This is where Milt Jackson was a teenager and was playing his music.  This is where Kenny Burrell used to come and play his music and several others.  Oscar Graves the sculptor came from that same community center.  So it was a lot of little things going on there that were inspirational things.  We didn't know it then but they had a good deal of effect on things that we did in the future.
Speaker 1: So did you get a chance to when you were drawing to doing any special projects for the school or for the community center?
Speaker 2: No it wasn't like that, it wasn't like that.  It was just something that you did.
Speaker 1: So nobody really recognized it in terms of having you do anything that was going to be permanent?
Speaker 2: Not that young, no.  That's the kind of thing they do now but they weren't doing that then.  My first job so to speak "job" I was nine and there was a model shop not too far from us.  They didn't have shopping centers then but there were certain streets that had a lot of businesses on it and Grashard [ph.] was our street and they sold model airplanes supplies and stuff in there and I found out that I could make model airplanes and he gave me a job making airplanes that he could use as display and I made three or four of them for him and that was a big project for me.
Speaker 1: Did you make them from scratch or were you just (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No they had those kits but they're not kits like most of these kits today where you have big solid pieces, you had the wing and you hooked the wing.  You had to make the wing out of these little strips of or balls of wood and then you had to stretch the paper over it you know.  So it was quite a project.  You could really mess up a living room (laugh) doing that believe me.  But I realized now it was teaching me tactile things, it was giving me a sense of achievement very, very young and then I got the idea I wanted to be a sign painter.  So as a kid I was painting little cars.  People would put things in those barbershops and things or in the grocery store and I had a little tool box that I painted and my slogan was "What We Can't Paint, Ain't," (laughter).  That was the thing.
Speaker 1: How old were you when you did this?
Speaker 2: Eleven, twelve, thirteen.
Story_ID: 244953
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about elementary school.  What elementary school did you attend?
Speaker 2: I went to Norvell [Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan], N-O-R-V-E-L-L to the sixth grade and then I went to Smith, Edgar Smith [Smith Elementary School; Bunche Preparatory Academy, Detroit, Michigan] which is now--it's changed its name it is now--his face is right in front of me and I've got a black out.  He was with the United Nations [UN] Bunche, Ralph Bunche they changed it to Ralph Bunche and then I went to [Levi] Barbour Intermediate School [Detroit, Michigan] that's B-A-R-B-O-U-R.  They didn't have middle school then.
Speaker 1: Intermediate school?
Speaker 2: Yeah intermediate school.  Norvell was up to the sixth grade and then you went to intermediate school which was ninth and then you went to high school.  You went into high school in the tenth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay so you went to Eastern High School [Detroit, Michigan], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 244954
Speaker 1: Well let me ask you one thing about childhood in terms of the drawing and painting or drawing.  Where did you--did you find it easy to get materials to draw with and on (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, easy are you kidding?
Speaker 1: Well I'm asking this because it's a loaded question and I already know (unclear).
Speaker 2: No it wasn't easy.  I could think of nothing more cherished than a 6B pencil and manila paper believe me, 6B pencil and manila paper you'd anything to get your hands on that.  But you see by the time I was fourteen and I was a freshman, tenth grade at Eastern High School [Detroit, Michigan]--I graduated at sixteen so I was a little bit early but by the time I was fourteen and I was industrious now.  My family believed heartedly in working.  You weren't a boy unless you had a job.  I had paper routes and all kind of stuff in between.  But I went to a sign company at the time it was the only black sign company in Detroit [Michigan] and it was on the east side over on Lafayette [Avenue], Ovelton Sign Company, O-V-E-L-T-O-N [ph.] and showed him the stuff that I had been doing and he was impressed.  So he asked to meet my parents [Lillian Jones Lockard] and Cecil Lockard] and he offered me an apprenticeship.  I started an apprenticeship at fourteen in the sign shop.  He paid one dollar a day and I would come over there after school, I'd go over there on Saturdays and so forth and without knowing it that is what introduced me to the idea of running a studio because for a two years he would not let me touch a brush.  My job was to clean the shop, clean everybody's brushes and be a gofer that was my job.  I don't think I ever got three dollars really because I was a kid and I'd want a bottle of pop or so forth and he had a little notebook, he'd deduct ten cents for pop.  So you know I learned budgeting very early through that place.  I used to hate that man but he did a wonderful thing for me and in time I learned to respect him greatly for what he did.  But that gave me an opportunity to be around--he had three other young men working there older than me they were teenagers and early twenties who were involved in art and they were doing the sign painting and so forth.  So again I had an opportunity to be exposed to other people--males who were doing artistic things and I say that emphatically males because there was also that prevalent attitude that if you did certain kinds of things you were feminine or better yet you were a sissy that was the expression that was used then.  So drawing, painting, singing, dancing, you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Fashion.
Speaker 2: Fashion, same thing.
Speaker 1: Hairdresser.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 244955
Speaker 1: This opens up another door because in terms of consciousness, because here at fourteen now I'm coming after school to work three hours in the afternoon if I wasn't playing ball in the shop [Ovelton Sign Company (ph.)].  I would clean up and clean up behind him and sometimes I would go out with them.  I would always be listening to these guys talk now because they were older than me they were young men about things that they were doing.  Now during that time we're talking 1945, 1946, 1947--no we're talking '46 [1946], '47 [1947], '48 [1948] that period of time you couldn't paint signs out on a scaffold or a ladder if you didn't belong to the union.  The union was segregated so these guys were really bandits.  They learned how to go out and paint this sign but if any of those trucks come around from any of those white companies that were on their case about working those big signs they could have violence.  So one of the lessons that I learned as a kid was how to get off a ladder quick and I'm very serious about that.  They used to always go under when they had this--put this scaffold up and they would be up there painting and you always carry a bucket of paint--a gallon bucket of paint that had just old paint thinner and crap in it that was for defense 'cause if anybody started to knock them off the ladder, they're going to throw the paint on them and they're going to slide down the ladder.  So you learn how to slide down a ladder like firemen did on the inside of your foot you could slide down from a story.  You can get down quicker than trying to go down a step 'cause they would literally knock the scaffold out from under you and you could fall and break your neck.  There had been a couple of very bad situations and it happened.  So at this young age here I am tuned to this kind of stuff which really had nothing to do with painting but then again it had a lot to do with painting, because I think that training back then gave me the fundamental background that influenced me into doing murals.
Story_ID: 244956
Speaker 1: You're saying that to be a sign painter in the black community was basically to take your life in your hands.  You could risk injury or serious injury by you going out and painting those signs.  You couldn't get in the union so (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And many of the sign painters were drunks which was another--I'm glad I didn't get into that but many of them were drunks and in fact as young guys we learned quite early how to take advantage of that because a lot of times and I when I say drunks, I'm not talking about blacks I mean blacks and whites they drank a lot.  A lot of times they would start jobs and not finish them and so we learned how to get those jobs and still make a little money from it.  In fact, the man who owned this business--Ovelton Harris [ph.] he spoke beautifully and his job every day is to just drive around town and he'd spot these things, write them down, get the phone number, call up the people and when he spoke on the phone he sounded like an educated white man and he'd say I noticed that your sign has been unfinished for a long time and we'd like to send some men out and get that job done for you and they'd say we would really appreciate that.  When they'd come out it would be us and they didn't care then they just wanted to get the job done and thus the union would come.  So a lot of things, really really interesting things came out of that experience and I learned a lot.  I forgot to mention that Mr. Harris didn't have any arms, he was born with just a finger on the right side and a it came down to about this far on the left side and he had like a finger--a thumb and one finger on the left side.
Speaker 1: Could he paint?
Speaker 2: Yes he could paint, he could paint very well.  He could drive a car, he could get up on those ladders and without knowing it we were also learning from him no excuse get the job done.   That was the environment and I'm talking about at an early young age that I was growing up in the midst of.  So it's a lot of things that happened during that period of time that really set a standard for me for the rest of my life.  My art was always there when I was going to school, my art was always there that was my little side job.
Story_ID: 244957
Speaker 1: How did you like school, I mean, otherwise?  Did you--
Speaker 2: I enjoyed school.  School was a traumatic place for me.  Now high school [Eastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] was where I started doing things for the school.  The yearbook [The Arrow], I'd do the covers and various kinds of things like that.  When I was in the eleventh grade there would be an annual contest run by J. L. Hudson Company [Detroit, Michigan] and what was then the largest outdoor advertising company in the city at that time was Walker & Company [Walker & Co., Detroit, Michigan] and it was running in conjunction with Walker & Company and J.L. Hudson and I submitted two pieces, I'm sorry three pieces in that contest that year.  That was 1947 or 1948--maybe 1948 and I won a first prize, a third prize and an honorable mention.  The first prize was a fifty dollar check which was a lot of money then and an internship at Walker & Company.  But now this was fantastic for me I had been working with Ovelton [Sign Company (ph.)].  Everybody worked under the shadow of Walker & Company not I'm going to get a chance to work with this big company.  So they had--the day of my interview and it had been in the newspaper, they announced over the loud speaker in school that I had won this contest and that I was going for my interview.  They gave me a half day off of school.  I got in my little one suit and got on the street car and went to Walker & Company.  I get there and the receptionist greeted me and she asked who I wanted to see and I gave her this man's name and she asked who I was, I told her who I was and she said, "Just a minute, sit down," and I sat there ten minutes, fifteen minutes.  I noticed people passing by looking out there, I could see 'em.
Story_ID: 244958
Speaker 1: I must have sat in that reception area [at Walker & Company, Detroit, Michigan] a good thirty minutes.  Finally this man comes out and he stands right in front of me and he said, "Yeah well, we just wonder, where did you learn how to paint like that?"  I told him a little bit.  He never brought me back in the office or anything just standing right there.  He said, "Yeah well we just were curious about how you learned how to paint and thanks very much, you did a good job" and before I knew it I was out on the street.  It didn't really hit me until I was out of there and I have to say as a young person that's the first time I consciously realized what had just happened to me and that took me aback, that really took me aback.  But that was something I don't think I'll ever forget that 'cause that could have literally changed my life.  I almost glad it didn't now but it could have.
Story_ID: 244959
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned playing ball.  Did you play ball in high school 'cause you're pretty tall?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah I played basketball and football and ran track also, yeah.
Speaker 1: How tall are you, you're about--
Speaker 2: Six five [6'5"].
Speaker 1: Six five [6'5"], so 6'5" in those days a lot of centers were six foot five.
Speaker 2: That was considered very tall then.  There were a few people taller than me around but I never was as good at sports as I wanted to be.  I was good enough to be on the team but I wasn't as good as I wanted to be.  It always seemed that the bottom line was art.  I was also involved in music, I was a percussionist.  Yes I played in the school band and I sang in the glee club and choir.  I was very busy in high school, very busy.  But I enjoyed it and all of those things have directly or indirectly played a part in my life all my life.
Speaker 1: Okay and so you were on these athletic teams at Eastern [High School, Detroit, Michigan] and the chorus and all of that and you played percussion in the band as well?
Speaker 2: Yes actually I played in the jazz band and the orchestra.  So I had a chance to move from snare drums to timpani it was a good rounded experience.
Speaker 1: Now what was your favorite music when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: My favorite music--I liked music and I liked to dance.  There wasn't this thing so much that there is today like hip hop or rhythm and blues.  This was just before rhythm and blues really licensed itself as rhythm and blues there was just black music and gospel music and classical music and marching music, I liked it all.  I think the sense of or the concept of spirituality though eventually embedded itself within me so far as music is concerned more so than anything else.  So when I did get involved in jazz, I got involved with a particular kind of jazz.  I really didn't--most of our friends didn't know much about blues until way later.  We knew what it was but it was like--it was something that we didn't deal with very much but popular music, [Nat] King Cole those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Now when you mean a spiritual kind of jazz what artist are you talking about or what pieces?
Speaker 2: Well that was an era when you talk about the '40s [1940s] and '50s [1950s] again in retrospect when I look back that was a very romantic era and much of the music was very romantic.  So you got singers like Billy Eckstine and Sarah Vaughan.  They sang romantic songs and invariably that was the attitude of people.  We danced close and et cetera. so when I say spiritual things that were emotional, things that were very, very emotional not confrontational.  Hip hop is in your face, it's confrontational.  Our thing was laid back; it was a very laid back era of time.  That does not mean we're not involved but there is a very close relationship between that kind of music and some of the spiritual music not the gospel music but spiritual music which is primarily a cappella.  So you get involved with tonal singing which is the origin of the quartets were singing which was the origin of the doo wops.  All that four part harmony thing, we was into that very heavily.
Story_ID: 244960
Speaker 1: Did you go to the prom and all that kind of stuff in high school?
Speaker 2: I went to the prom but see we had to--I went to another school's prom.  The school that I went to regardless to all that activity had a very small population of black students.  That school of course you may notice but that school when they closed that school in early '60s [1960s] and moved that whole population downtown and built Martin Luther King [Jr. Senior] High School [Detroit, Michigan] that's the foundation of King High School.  But that school was about maybe black students--maybe ten percent of the population, the big population was Italian and Polish and so I went to the prom but I didn't go to Eastern's [Eastern High School, Detroit, Michigan] prom, I went to Northern's [Northern High School, Detroit, Michigan] prom.  That's the way it was and you went to certain places.  We didn't live in abject segregation but we kind of knew where to and where not to go.
Speaker 1: It was social separation.
Speaker 2: Yeah the big place in town when I was a teenager were social things went on was the YWCA [Young Women's Christian Association], Lucy Thurman YWCA [Detroit, Michigan] and kids were there literally from all over town but just a few years after that as housing changed and people moved around and so forth then comes the gangs and then you knew better than to go on the other side of town forget the race, you didn't go over there.  You go on the north end or you go on the west side you might get your hind end spanked.  Again wasn't any shooting but you would get beat up.  So when it comes to proms or social things like that without any question there were certain areas that you went and certain things that you just didn't do.
Story_ID: 244961
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating from high school [Eastern High School, Detroit, Michigan], did you--what were your prospects?  Were you thinking about going to college or were you thinking about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's an interesting story that has a fantastic climax.  My counselor called me to his office one day and said what is this I hear about you talking about you going to college, I said well I was entertaining the thought and he said was what you should do is get yourself a job in the factory and get married and raise a family, you're not college material, you shouldn't go.  Now I'd been college prep for three years and then they had general, commercial and college prep.
Speaker 1: Let's get this straight.  Here is your counselor in most scenarios the counselor is a person who is encouraging people to get higher education, he goes out of his way to call you and tell you you should not go to college.
Speaker 2: I was very embarrassed by it too and didn't tell anybody.
Speaker 1: Is this a white counselor?
Speaker 2: That's all that there were.  I never had a--I'm sorry there was only one black teacher in my entire educational experience and that was in elementary school [Norvell Elementary School, Detroit, Michigan].  Now she wasn't my teacher but she was in the school.  She was the only one that I ever saw.
Speaker 1: Did you have any mentors along the way in terms of teachers that helped or anything?
Speaker 2: Yeah but we didn't use that term mentor like I say my Uncle Robert [Jones (ph.)] without any question he was a mentor but we didn't know that then.  You gather things indirectly so often.  But let me go on and tell you about this story.  I resented him very much.  When I went to Wayne State [University, Detroit, Michigan] it was Wayne University then and I graduated with a bachelor's degree when I got a bachelor's degree they didn't have copying machines like they have now.  They had those little--what do you call those things, it wasn't a Xerox it was (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Mimeograph.
Speaker 2: Mimeograph--I made a mimeograph of my degree and I sent it to him.  I went to Meinzingers Art School [Meinzinger Foundation Art School, Detroit, Michigan] and I sent him a copy also of my degree.  Maybe ten years later a group of us from Eastern had a little reunion party and we got together a bunch of fellows talking and drinking and so forth and we got to talking about Mr. Smith [ph.] this counselor and one of the fellows his name was Ronald [D.] Palmer who ended up--he graduated from Howard University [Washington, D.C.] and ended up being an ambassador to Mortania [sic. Mauritius] and he said you know what Mr. Smith told me and I said what, he said he told me that I wasn't college material that I should go get a job in a factory and get married and that broke the ice.  And another one said what he told me that too and I said he told me that too, come to find out he told all of us that and we will never know how many youngsters took that advice, we'll never know.  If we hadn't had that one party that night we would have never known that he told--'cause nobody told anybody that 'cause they were embarrassed.
Speaker 1: Wow so rather than encourage your counselor went out of the way to discourage his black students at least from going to college.
Speaker 2: Yeah very true, in fact I don't know if you have interviewed this individual or not but are you familiar with the name Brazil Danai [ph.]?  He has Brazil Danai Coral in Detroit [Michigan] for all of these years he headed the music department for the board of education for many, many years.  Well he was in our neighborhood also and he told him that also, he told him that also.  So that kind of thing we got accustomed to but then I flip back to that period of time I was at Ovelton Sign Company [ph.] and those things that we learned--those defensive things that we learned without realizing that attitude flowed over into other things and you learn how to overcome that.  You learn how to overcome obstacles.
Story_ID: 244962
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Wayne State [Wayne University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan], when you--now you graduated from high school in '48 [1948]?
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 1: Forty-nine [1949].
Speaker 2: January '49 [1949].
Speaker 1: You said you were sixteen, (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Almost seventeen.
Speaker 1: In those days a lot of people though kind of came out young didn't they?
Speaker 2: Yeah they got double promoted in elementary school and that's how that happened.
Speaker 1: Now what was Wayne like?
Speaker 2: Wayne was a very different place.  Wayne was welcoming in a way.  I was at Wayne for two years, right I was at Wayne for two years and then I jump up and get married and quit school and my wife [Carolyn Barnett] was pregnant, got a job in a factory and did that for two years.  I did that for two years and I decided at the end of the first year--during the first year my son was born and on the day that he was born I have mental from his birth because on the day that he was born I was working in the factory--working a punch press and my mind was someplace else as you can imagine and I put my finger under the machine and I hit the button and smashed my finger.  I was lucky I pulled it out but I still had--so that's the anniversary of that event and on that day I decided that this was not the life for me.  From that moment on I started making my plans to go back to school and et cetera, which I eventually did.  As I said I graduated from Wayne and then went to Meinzingers Art School [Meinzinger Foundation Art School, Detroit, Michigan], graduated from there.
Speaker 1: And how do you spell the name of that art school?
Speaker 2: M-E-I-N-Z-E-N-G-E-R-S it was right on Woodward [Avenue] and Hancock [Street] at the time.
Speaker 1: So you went to Wayne State and you started in '49 [1949] I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah I started in '49 [1949], I didn't graduate though until '55 [1955].
Speaker 1: Then you went to Meinzingers.  Did you major in art at Wayne State?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So why would you go to Meinzingers Art School after Wayne State?
Speaker 2: Because I needed a job and I also wanted more exposure.
Story_ID: 244963
Speaker 1: Job was, next door to Meinzingers [Meinzinger Foundation Art School, Detroit, Michigan] was Palmer Paint Company [Detroit, Michigan].  Now that may mean nothing to you but Palmer Paint Company originated paint by the numbers and that was a great education.  I worked there for a year and that was a great education for me because it was such a learning experience and a lot of the local artists worked there part-time because there we made a lot of money.  We made two dollars and fifty cents an hour that was a lot of money then.
Speaker 2: Now at Palmer Paint Company would you actually compose the paint by numbers paintings?
Speaker 1: Well they would give us photographs and we would break the photograph down into sections and color and designs and so forth.  So it was good discipline, it was great discipline.  I had no idea how big that was going to be though but it was and a lot of the fellows worked there because by comparison when I was at Wayne [University; Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan] at a part-time job fortunately I was painting signs on the side.  But I had a part-time job there and I was making sixty-five cents an hour.  So two dollars and a half an hour was--I was doing good, I was doing very good.  I'll stop until you ask me another question.
Speaker 2: That's interesting.  So the breaking down of those colors has that influenced the way you paint now you think?
Speaker 1: Not really but it certainly helped me in a teaching career 'cause it helped me explain a whole lot of things in a way where students could understand in ways that I didn't understand.  The whole idea of becoming an artist still was not clear in my head.  I was thinking in terms of becoming a commercial artist 'cause just that idea of commercial, there was work to be had.
Story_ID: 244964
Speaker 1: But in the mid-'50s [1950s] or the late '50s [1950s] somewhere around in there I started doing portraits and that opened me up to a whole new world.  We'd go out to the Michigan State Fair and sketch out there with large groups of artists and that just open up my scope.
Speaker 2: Were you doing full color portraits or charcoal or (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Both.
Speaker 2: Both okay.  I think a lot of people who have encountered your work or at least my generation encountered the black and white work first and looked well reproduced because it was black oil already and the value was already what they should be.  So you were doing portraits at the state fair and that sort of thing?
Speaker 1: Yeah then I started traveling around all over the country and Canada.  That's how I ended up taking classes at--graduate classes at University of Toronto [Toronto, Ontario, Canada] but I'd traveled all around and I worked at a couple of World's Fairs, traveled on gambling ships, Acapulco [Mexico], [RMS] Queen Elizabeth going back across the Atlantic [Ocean] doing portraits.
Speaker 2: Now were you still married during all this time?
Speaker 1: Well no first marriage ended, second marriage had begun.  My second marriage then my second son was born and all of this was really going on in the late '50s [1950s] and all of the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Did you paint at the New York World's Fair [New York, New York] or (simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Not to New York but Seattle [Century 21 Exposition, Seattle, Washington].
Speaker 2: Seattle, right so they built a space (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Absolutely Seattle and that was '63 [sic. 1962], '73 [1973] I was in Washington--the other city east Washington not Tacoma [Washington], Spokane [Washington] yeah Spokane.
Speaker 2: Well Spokane (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah Spokane that was the second World's Fair [Expo '74] that I worked.  But that moving around gave me and of course that's also right in the initial development of the Civil Rights Movement, gave me a chance to go into the South and to see and to hear and become sensitized to what was happening there, all of which affected my work, the kinds of things that I was concentrating on.
Story_ID: 244965
Speaker 1: So you went down south during the Civil Rights Movement?  Okay, so where did you go and who did you meet?
Speaker 2: Well, the first place I went was Houston, Texas.  I went to Houston, Texas at Texas Southern University and met John [T.] Biggers who invariably became a mentor of mine.
Speaker 1: John Biggers out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], right?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Wasn't he from Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Oh he's from Texas.
Speaker 2: He's from Texas, he was born in Virginia [sic. North Carolina] but he established his reputation as the chairman of our department at Texas Southern University [Texas State University for Negroes, Houston, Texas].  He became a muralist and author and God knows how many other things.  But Jackson, Mississippi also, I had a little experience there.  I've never been in the State of Arkansas though which is kind of ironic since both of my parents [Lillian Jones Lockard and Cecil Lockard] comes from there but I've never been to the State of Arkansas.
Speaker 1: But Biggers--well he's passed now but he was a great artist.
Speaker 2: Great, great artist, in fact this project [The John Biggers Seed Project] that [HistoryMaker Willis] Bing [Davis] and I are working within Minneapolis [Minnesota] is in memory of John Biggers.  He had gone up there first and started something and that's another story but it's a continuation of the Biggers' legacy, wonderful man.  A lot of things happened at that period in time, late '50s [1950s] all of the '60s [1960s].  A lot of things were happening that nurtured the '70s [1970s].  In retrospect I'm sure a lot of that attitudinal things, a lot of the places where you draw your strengths all fed into that particular era.  A tremendous amount of traveling, having exposure to other people, no longer a child, beginning to recognize the power of my work of art as a language, learning to speak through that language.  It was a very, very important period of time in my life.  A lot of things were under the cover of something else but still a lot of important things happened.  So when I went into the '70s [1970s] as things really began to happen in the country, I had a preparation from all of that stuff they gave me some insight into who I am today.  Even to the fact--I mean I never had any intention of being a teacher, never but I was invited to do it and I thought I'd do it for a quick minute to get economically straightened out and I ended up being involved in it for now thirty-six years.
Story_ID: 244966
Speaker 1: How did it happen?  Now, you were basically making a living as an artist doing portraits and so forth (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah I was but it was tough, it was a lot traveling involved which doesn't help stability at home.  Money came hard, money came hard; we'll put it that way.  At the same time I felt destined to do but when these opportunities arose I didn't see them in conflict with what I was doing and they really never have been.   They've really have helped fuel that energy and that effort.  I made many, many very close friends all of the in distant places but my closest friends over the years have been [HistoryMaker Willis] Bing Davis in Dayton [Ohio] and Murry DePillars who was out of Chicago [Illinois], that's the second one I'm going to recommend him to you tomorrow too, who had then gone on and got his Ph.D. at Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] and then went into Virginia Commonwealth [University] in Richmond, Virginia and became the dean of the school of arts.  We all joined the National Conference of Artists and we've all been tight ever since and it's been like a family it really had been like a family.  They've been as much like brothers to me, in fact they've more like brothers than my own brothers which I don't hesitate to say because when you work in a realm that we work in and yet live in the environments that we live in there's not a lot of people to talk to and it keeps you sane when you can intercommunicate in certain kinds of ways.  In fact, that's included in my lessons--in my teachings both here at the University [of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and at the community college [Washtenaw Community College, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  We can talk about art, the process of art, we can talk about art and the business of art but we also must take time to talk about staying sane, I've lost a lot of friends that way.

Speaker 1: Initially I had a little studio here in Ann Arbor [Michigan].  I had come to Ann Arbor from Detroit [Michigan], I was still living in Detroit but I had opened a studio here and I had not begun teaching yet.  Murry [DePillars] called me and told me there was something I had to go to at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] so I said okay.  So me and another friend of mine we got in our car and we drove over to Northwestern in Evanston and this was right at the time when student demonstrations were really heavy about the Vietnamese war [Vietnam War].  We pull up to Northwestern University and it was under siege.  There was--the National Guard was there, guns out, students with red bandanas on their head, the whole bit.  The whole campus was closed except for one building and that one building that was open was where CONFABA [Conference on the Functional Aspects of Black Arts] was going on and I go in there--what it was [HistoryMaker] Jeff Donaldson was writing his dissertation on African American art and he had pulled this conference together which he called the conference of bad [sic. black] artists or something like that.  I can't remember exactly but anyway I had never seen such a group of African Americans artists before in my life.  Painters, writers, actors, Amiri Baraka was there, [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis was there people from everywhere was there and they were committing themselves--their art to the struggle that was my initiation.  The next thing was National Conference of Artists [NCA].  The first conference I went to was in Chicago [Illinois] and that's when I really got involved.  By the time we got to Howard University in Washington [D.C.] that's when [HistoryMaker Willis] Bing [Davis] came and we all became friends there, of course Murry was my friend already.
Speaker 2: Now when was the NCA conference in Chicago that you attended?
Speaker 1: That was 1960--it must have been '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Okay so right after--a year after [sic. before] CONFABA.
Speaker 1: Yeah right after CONFABA.
Speaker 2: Now the NCA was formed way before that.
Speaker 1: Forty-five years ago, yes.
Speaker 2: So now you all as young artists, you were young guys then and you were doing (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We were the rabble rousers, yeah.
Speaker 2: Did you know about NCA at the time you all were painting and drawing?
Speaker 1: No didn't know anything.
Speaker 2: So [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs and her group basically founded NCA, right?
Speaker 1: Right and it was primarily a group of artists from the South--from southern schools and so forth.  They got Jack Jordan from Baton Rouge [Louisiana], Southern University [and Agricultural and Mechanical College, Baton Rouge, Louisiana], Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama] and Arthur Britt many of the southern schools.
Speaker 2: They were from the black colleges [HBCUs].
Speaker 1: From the black colleges and at that time they could not belong to the National Teachers Organizations of Artists [ph.] and so forth, they couldn't belong to those.  So they formulated their own organization which was initially just an organization for social getting together and it developed from there.  By the time we got involved in it the nation was in an uproar and we were bringing a whole lot of political thoughts into it.  In fact, we tried to petition to get them to change the name of the National Conference of Black Artists, they refused to do it.  But that was that same period of time and it gave us an opportunity to have interactions with people from all over the country and invariably different parts of the world.
Story_ID: 244968
Speaker 1: The story of the artist here seems to parallel the story of a lot of other groups who after, and correct me if I'm wrong, after the assassination of [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] started forming black organizations and before that time it seems like it wasn't as much activity around trying to do this.  Did you have any (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was more social before then than political.  After then it became very political, in fact Murry [DePillars] became president [of the National Conference of Artists (NCA)], [HistoryMaker Willis] Bing [Davis] became president, I became president all of us kind of a continuity.  Now we are all on the board of directors which gives us a chance to kind of oversee and keep a certain thrust.  But you're right after that there became a lot of organizations that had that intent and attitude which had a lot to do with some other things that happened also at that same period of time as beginning a black studies program and institutions across the country.  The same people were brought right in to those spots and so the thrust became a little different than it had been before.
Speaker 1: So the NCA--I know [HistoryMaker] Margaret Burroughs has always been progressive in a lot of ways.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) She was one of the founders absolutely.
Speaker 1: Did it kind of bridge the age gap--did you make a connection that hadn't been made before at that point when you got the NCA?
Speaker 2: To a great extent we did not totally.  As we began the previous group which were the initial group were just beginning to phase out because of age, because of health and things like that.
Story_ID: 244969
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Margaret [Burroughs] is super woman, she managed to stay in the midst of all of that--which I have to tell you one little story about Margaret, if I might.  How Margaret and I bonded.  That was when I was on the executive board [of National Conference of Artists (NCA)], I wasn't president I was on the executive board and we had begun the concept of international conferences.  We pulled together a conference in Suriname South America and when that one was over we planned a second one there and so Margaret and myself and one other person Dwight Smith from Detroit [Michigan], we went to Suriname to find a site for our next conference there.  The touring agent took us out in the middle of the rain forest to someplace that was out there--that's where we were going.  We were in a little Volkswagen bus and it was about nine or ten of us in that thing from different parts of the country and while we were out going to this place they had a coup in the country.  We didn't know it at the time, we just turned and rode this heavily--the heavy growth and all of that if you can imagine this little road, all of a sudden in the middle of the road there is a tank and soldiers out in front of the tank with guns in their hands.  Oh my Lord what is this and they don't speak a word of English and we did not speak Sudanan [ph.] tongue.  So here we are, they made us get out of the bus and we went through a little thing with them but they finally felt that we were not a threat to them and let us go.  When we get back to the hotel the hotel is right next to the military barracks and when we get back to the hotel everybody in the hotel like the people who worked there and everything, they all got the safe open and getting the money and everything and running.  We don't know what to do (laugh).  We ended up at the house of the tour guide.  We had to walk about two miles in the midst of all that turmoil not knowing what was going to happen at any moment.  But we finally got there and the American Embassy [Embassy of the United States, Paramaribo, Suriname] took us two day and we finally got out of there.  But Margaret and I bonded during that period of time.  We talked about it many times afterwards that how interesting it is where art has taken us and the kinds of things and meeting people and situations that happened in these different countries.  The Suriname was a very interesting country in that the Dutch had done something in their colonization of the people a little different than what they did here in the United States in slavery that is they enslaved everybody, the Hindi [sic. Hindu], the Amerindians, the Africans, the Asians, the Chinese they enslaved everybody.  The result of that was all these people became very close to each other and so when slavery was over the community still has that mindset.  They didn't have any sense of separation, very interesting people.  You go to one artist's house and he shows you his work and he says, "Have you been to my African brother's house," and I'd say, "no," and then we'd go there and he says, "Have you been to my Hindi brother's house," that's the spirit.  It's a wonderful place you should visit there sometime, wonderful place--
Story_ID: 244970
Speaker 1: There's a group of black people who live up river--up the Suriname River that escaped from slavery and they've been independent since the 1600s (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Those are the river--absolutely, we made a film there, we did a film there.  In fact, Channel 56 [WTVS, Detroit, Michigan] took a crew down there during that same period of time and we made a film there with Dobru Raveles [R. Dobru] he was their national poet, he was our guide.
Speaker 1: How do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: His first name is D-O-B-R-U, his last name R-A-V-E-L-E-S.  He's dead now but he was their national poet and he took us right up into the river nation and we met the people and talk--in fact I even ended up doing poetry there.  But I got a film that I could share with you on the river people.
Speaker 1: I remember I first heard about it from Allen Counter [HistoryMaker S. Allen Counter] or (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Absolutely the two of them went there.  They did their film just before we did ours.
Speaker 1: Right they had [HistoryMaker] James Earl Jones narrating.  It's called 'I Sought My Brother[: An Afro-American Reunion,' S. Allen Counter and David L. Evans].
Speaker 2: That's right, absolutely correct.
Speaker 1: NCA [National Conference of Artists] has been to Brazil, which is right below Suriname (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We've been to Brazil twice; we've been to Senegal and Senegambia once yeah.
Speaker 1: Now when were you in Suriname?
Speaker 2: I was in Suriname in '86 [1986] in fact I was president at that time and I brought the conference to Senegal.  We chose Senegal because of several prominent artists--Senegalese artists that were there at that time and then that was at the tail end of the whole negritude concept which was very prevalent then.  So yeah we went there in actually '85 [1985] and '86 [1986].  The conference was in '86 [1986].
Speaker 1: That's when [Leopold] Senghor was still the president.
Speaker 2: That's when Senghor was still there yes absolutely.
Speaker 1: Was Suriname in the '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 2: Suriname was in the early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: Early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: In the early '80s [1980s], yes, Suriname was in I think '83 [1983].
Story_ID: 244971
Speaker 1: Let me jump back to the '70s [1970s] for a minute.  But I wanted to ask you about your artwork and some of the--I think that one of the pieces of art that most people who first heard the name of [HistoryMaker] Jon [Onye] Lockard remember are the portrait of these young black men ['What Are You Going to Tell Them']--young boys angry (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That wasn't the first one.
Speaker 1: It's not the first one you did but (unclear).
Speaker 2: The first one was 'The Black Messiah.'
Speaker 1: 'Black Messiah'?  Okay well tell us about what you were trying to do with that, I was going to ask you about the other one but go ahead.
Speaker 2: Well really one feeds into the other.  Actually I did that particular painting at the same period of time of the beginning of the Shrine of [the] Black Madonna in Detroit [Michigan].  I had another--Glanton Dowdell did the one of the Black Madonna and I did one of a Black Messiah in there but it was a different painting than this one but that's where I got the idea that I'm going to put this out there.  That was my first print that was my first print.  Actually I had done a lot of reading; I had even considered at one time going into serious study about the Bible.  I had listened an awful lot and then mentored by [HistoryMaker] Yosef Ben-Jochannan.
Speaker 1: Dr. Ben from New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Dr. Ben without any question New York City and I began to reevaluate many ideas and thoughts that I had previously had and I wrestled with those ideas through images.  I've been convinced a long time ago that most people don't pay any attention to what you say, they don't listen to you.  So rather than distill those thoughts, I take it into my art and that's what I did with that first painting and that painting opened the doors for a lot of other things.  The boys that you're talking about--oh let me say this before I forget it the first sale of consequence that I had of that particular print it was published in Black World magazine and (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Is this 'The Black Messiah'?
Speaker 2: 'Black Messiah' and it was also in an Ebony story and they get around.  I got an order from Judson Press in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania which before then I knew nothing about them.  That's the largest Christian publishing house in the world and they send stuff all over the world.  I got an order from them and then I got a big order from the University of Stuttgart in Stuttgart, Germany, and that let me know that I was on to something that around here wasn't happening--
Story_ID: 244972
Speaker 1: The boys, that was 1967, that was during the first couple of days of the Detroit [Michigan] riots.  My studio was in Ann Arbor [Michigan] at the time and actually we were on the radio--on television (unclear) and I jumped in my car and I get back home 'cause my family was in Detroit.  Well the second day I went down on 12th Street actually I went down there because I had done some murals in a couple of nightclubs down there and I wanted to see if they survived, they hadn't.  Rubble everywhere, kids everywhere so I saw this group of kids but I didn't pay particular attention to them because I had my camera, I'm taking pictures.  I looked around and those kids are standing almost within three feet of me looking at me.  So I started talking to them and they asked me who are you taking pictures of and I told them, why are you taking pictures, I told them.  They said do you live here and I said yeah and we had a conversion, we ended up having about a thirty minute conversation standing there.  It's struck me very deeply.  The name of that particular picture you're talking about is 'What Are You Going to Tell Them' because it just impacted my mind what are we going to tell these kids.  What do we tell them, how do we tell them, how do we guide them, where do we guide them to and that motivated a lot of work that I have done.  In fact I did another one of a young man--a teenager and I'm sure you saw that in prints also, he's got no shirt on and it's called '[A] Dream Deferred' and I use Langston Hughes' poem on it.  "What happens to a dream deferred?"   These young people--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's interesting 'cause I was thinking not to interrupt you or anything but 'What Are We Going to Tell Them' [sic.] is the art version of 'Dream Deferred.'
Speaker 1: No I've got 'A Dream Deferred.'
Speaker 2: I know you've got one but I think when people see 'What Are We Going to Tell Them' that's--it's the intensity of their countenance as they look at you from that canvas, I mean it really makes you, and it does (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They're looking right at you.
Speaker 2: --yeah, it raises a question, what are you going to tell them.  And if you don't have anything to tell them, what is going to happen.
Story_ID: 244973
Speaker 1: Well see, that's the way I talk through my work.  I have another one called 'Ahm Gonna Raise This One Myself.'  I say I'm going to--A-H-M going to raise this one myself, and it's a grandmother with a about seven or eight year old kid in her lap, a piece of Kente cloth around them and she's sitting up in church and I did that picture ten years ago.  But it's still there, our young men in jail, strung out on drugs, our young women having these early pregnancies and having no skills and the grandmothers or grandparents in their prime of their life and the time where they don't have the energy they used to have but they've got to raise those kids themselves, take that responsibility on to themselves 'cause the kids' parents are not doing it.  If you come to that opening that painting will be there because I'd love for you to see it because I'm dealing with these kinds of issues and as a result of Kuumba [Lynx] and going to Chicago [Illinois], I also got tuned in to the relationship of art.  The interrelationship of the arts and so I got poets that read poems based upon thoughts in the paintings and singers that sing songs, we do all of that kind of thing because it's sensitizes the audience to the intensity of the images and the importance of the images and that kind of thing has really taken over my professional artistic career.  I enjoy doing it as painful as it is.  It gives me a voice that I feel very comfortable in.  It gives me the opportunity to not only expose the art but to expose the thoughts.  It's the thoughts that are important, it's the thoughts where the philosophy and the ideology that I've adhered to over the years comes into my work and thus gives it a chance for people to be exposed to it and links me in with all kinds of situations and people who have common ideas and common thoughts.
Story_ID: 244974
Speaker 1: How did you start teaching, now how did that start?
Speaker 2: Well in my studio I used to teach evening classes just something I used to have fun doing working with people.  Then I had a couple of young men--handicapped young men who I'd encouraged to get involved with some formal education, they needed it.  They had just opened up the community college [Washtenaw Community College, Ann Arbor, Michigan] in this area and they did.  They came back to me a short time later and said they were just formulating black studies classes there and they wanted to know if they could recommend me if I would consider teaching.  So I said okay I'll do it for a minute.  Within two months of that same thing happened here at the university [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  The BAM [Black Action Movement] strike and all of that and again some people came--a committee came to me and asked me if I would consider teaching.  Fortunately I've never actually applied for a job they always came to me and it stuck and I never moved.  So that's how I came into the whole teaching thing.  Actually I taught what was my hobby, African American studies was my hobby.  It was something that I did and enjoyed doing.  Going to Chicago [Illinois], meeting people and so forth these were things that were encompassed in my life and all of a sudden I'm in a classroom.  So that became my resource that I began to draw from, and it's a part of my life now.
Story_ID: 244975
Speaker 1: In terms of black academia--well among black intellectuals and writers there was a lot of discussion about is there a black aesthetic or not.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: I remember Martin [L.] Kilson [Jr.] said there was no such thing as that.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Addison Gayle [Jr.] challenged it and other voices.
Speaker 2: You've got a good memory, yes.
Speaker 1: What's your opinion about that?
Speaker 2: Well I think the discussion is deeper than the words that we used that there's something underneath that's hiding and it comes directly out of slavery and all of the issues that preceded that W.E.B. Du Bois and et cetera.  I think the issue is we're human because as humans there are certain things to be expected from not only their behaviors but from the way they deal with life and the reality of life and it goes back to that culture issue.  There's never an issue about is there an aesthetic with civilized people.  Of course we have an aesthetic.  You asked me earlier what was my favorite color and I said I enjoy color, well I'm going to just take you on a little trip for example.  Many people who look at my paintings and it's one of the things that really irritates me.  Oh I love the way you deal with color, you deal with such bright colors and so forth.  The first time I went to Brazil, I went to Brazil before I went to Africa.  The first time I went to Brazil I was fascinated with the rich color that I saw in people's clothing, the foliage, the (unclear), everything was beautiful.  When I came back home I'll never forget this, coming back home over [Detroit] Metropolitan Airport [Detroit, Michigan] and just as the plane is landing I'm looking down and everything looked--it was in August and everything looked gray to me.  The green grass looked gray, the trees looked gray.  The ride home, getting back home, I'm looking and everything looked like dust was on it.  It took me a while for my eyes to adjust.  I said all of that to say it hadn't dawn on me at first that we have a northern light here and we see color differently.  When you get to Africa, Brazil you're close to the equator and there's a totally different light and colors are much richer and richer brighter and I bring that into my work.  I know exists, I know why exists even in complexions of people very dark people--the darkest people that I've ever seen in my life I saw in Senegal but the light there brings out a purple in their skin which I use in my paintings.  That same complexion--that same dark complexion in the United States you have to use green in it because the northern light is different and it's duller than the richness that you find when you get close to the equator.  So is there a black aesthetic, of course there is and just being a person raised in the United States and in these parables I'm sure you've heard particularly when you talk about churches and elderly black women and they talk about those tacky bright clothes they wear all the time that's comes straight out of that aesthetic.  It comes straight out of that aesthetic.  So when it's in your eyes, when it's in your mind and it's something that you're accustomed to, of course it's on your pallet, of course it's on your pallet and to have that kind of intellectual discussion is absolutely ridiculous.  Get in a discussion with somebody from Finland and talk about color someone who lives in darkness most of their lives and talk about that.  They have an aesthetic; they have a particular way of looking at color very, very different than in southern Italy or let's go to Egypt where you have the desert, the vastness of a particular kind of sand color everywhere.  Imagine what happens, it's in your eyes, in your value, it's in your aesthetic, it's in your concept.
Story_ID: 244976
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you about FESTAC '77 [Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture, Lagos, Nigeria], and--
Speaker 2: Yeah I went to FESTAC, which was my first trip to Africa.  It was also again one of those startling opportunities to elevate your concept of the arts and also was a real initiation into the dynamics of politics in the arts.  To see people like Imamu [Amiri Baraka], [HistoryMaker] Haki [Madhubuti] and so forth.  I have a little story, very short, that almost sums up that experience. Similar to the Olympics they were coming to the stadium under the banner of your country, your flag and something similar to this happened in Suriname also but I found a nice place in the stands got my camera ready I'm going to get these pictures.  All of a sudden I feel somebody tap me on the shoulder and I look around and there is this African brother there and he says aren't you an American and I said yes he said you should be down there.  I said oh my God and again it caught me, I heard what he was saying, I heard what he was saying and I had placed a priority of me getting pictures instead of being part of something.  Those kinds of things have given me and so many I can't even count but those kinds of things have given me a sense of place to let me know that there are certain things you should do.  There are certain places that you should be, there are certain things that should be said and to me that's what manhood is about.  Not always being on the fringe, not always biting your tongue when sometimes some things need to be said.  You choose the way to say it but sometimes things need to be said.  I saw that happening at FESTAC with people sitting down together sharing ideas and talking about things.  In fact I remember another session there in one of those little houses with all these stories going on and each one of these people from these different countries would take turns talking about the wonderful things that they loved about their country and finally it was my turn.  I had to fish for words, I could talk about wonderful things about my family; I could talk about wonderful things about my friends but my country.  The whole concept was foreign to me.  I was so accustomed to operating incognita or in the shadows here.  Don't be too outstanding here, hold your tongue there and when you sit down and talk about my country, I mean I could talk about it a lot better today than I could then.  But that was one of the things that made me realize the kinds of things that I ought to be working on, the kinds of things that I ought to be more conscious of, and I have been since that time.  But that came out of FESTAC, that came out of FESTAC.  So I don't want to overstate 'cause I can get to whining about these stories, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 244977
Speaker 1: Tell me, before we get into another philosophical question, what are some of your major works?  What do you consider your major works?  I know you have this tremendous mural ['The Tallest Tree in the Forest'] at Central State University [Wilberforce, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Oh I have much bigger that than in Detroit [Michigan] at Wayne State University in the Manoogian building [Manoogian Hall].  We got a whole mural cycle there it's called 'Take Back Your Mind.'  It's in the African American lecture hall.  I encourage you to see it.
Speaker 1: Right I haven't seen it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Isn't that something yeah okay and they have done something that's been so encouraging to me throughout the years.  I did it in 1980 and they've maintained it.  There's been a little--you know students scratch things and so forth but they are maintaining it very well--vandalism is what I was thinking but it's been without any question one of the major things I've done.  I've done several of these lounges like this room on this campus.  I've done five different ones, did the work at Central State.  I call these outstanding public works that's been done.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite work that you've done?  One that you think is--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well some things are your favorite at certain periods of time; it's all according to what's going on.  But I guess I'd have to say the Wayne State pieces are my favorite.  I've also got another piece at the [Charles H. Wright] Museum of African American History [Detroit, Michigan] that was financed by Seagram's [Seagram Company Ltd.]--funded by Seagram's.
Speaker 1: Did you work primarily in the Midwest, I mean the public works?
Speaker 2: Primarily yeah.  I did a couple of those walls when the Wall of Respect was very, very popular but those building have since been torn down.  There are some of my things I published in this book '[Walls of Heritage] Walls of Pride[: African American Murals]' by [James Prigoff and] Robin Dunitz, D-U-N-I-T-Z.  She went around the country taking pictures of murals around the country so I've got stuff in there.
Speaker 1: How do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: D-U-N-I-T-Z.
Speaker 1: Okay 'Walls of Pride' are there any other published collections of your work?
Speaker 2: Not collections but book covers and inserts.  Michael [D.] Harris just did the book 'Colored Pictures[: Race and Visual Representation'] and my Aunt Jemima ['No More'] is in there and Aunt Jemima ended up being--I never would have dreamed of it.  Aunt Jemima ended up being in at least seven or eight books.
Story_ID: 244978
Speaker 1: Now I know that Murry DePillars has a famous Aunt Jemima and you've got a famous Aunt Jemima?  How did this Aunt Jemima thing start?
Speaker 2: That's a social documentary.  You know, Uncle Ben's Rice and these things were all out in the public and we had to take issue with it and these were the popular things that you could really take 'cause everybody had a feeling about it, everybody had seen it and everybody had accepted it and so we could take issue with those things.  That's really how it happened and turned into far more that I ever dreamed it would turn into.
Speaker 1: Now what does your Aunt Jemima doing (simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My Aunt Jemima has a big frown on her face, her head rag--bandana is red, black and green, her fist is coming through the box where you open the box it says open at your own risk.  It's titled 'No More' 'cause I felt that degradation of an African American woman and particularly for all that she represented and how it had been used, how it had been used over a long period of time.  It had nothing to do with Aunt Jemima 'cause Aunt Jemima initially was first made public--first came to the public at the [1893] Chicago World's Fair [World's Columbian Exposition, Chicago, Illinois] in the latter part of the nineteenth century.
Speaker 1: Eighteen ninety-three [1893].
Speaker 2: Right she was a very dignified looking woman and she introduced that product--she was hired to introduce that product but certainly not as a slave, certainly not as a mammy figure.  All that came later after she had died.  That all came during that terrible era of the early part of the 20th century when all that lynching was going on.  That's when that became very popular.  I also had an opportunity to do some work way back then for Colonel Sanders.  I met him and I heard him talk, I listened to him talk about that recipe and it reminded me instantly of Aunt Jemima.  All of that was in my head when I did that picture.  How this slave who cooked this chicken like nobody else could cook that chicken and on her deathbed, she whisper the recipe to Colonel Harland Sanders which was a pinch of dis, d-i-s,  a dash of dat, d-a-t and this image used to make me seethe.  How this kind of thing could just manifest itself amongst our people.  So that was my way of taking issue with it.  I can't get on the street corners and fuss about it, I can't get on the soap box but I can paint a picture about it and I did.  Murry painted his actually Murry painted his about two months before I painted mine.
Speaker 1: These are transformative pictures you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes they are, 'cause [HistoryMaker] Jeff [Donaldson] did one also.  All of them are in Michael [D.] Harris's book 'Colored Pictures[: Race and Visual Representation'] which is beautiful that you could show that this is a movement thing.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That enough people--we have a wonderful opportunity right now by the way, even though it comes at a strange time because to a great extent it comes after certain thoughts have been devalued.  But we have a wonderful opportunity right now to become an educated people.  I think that's what underneath what Bill Cosby is doing.  He's going around the country talking because there's so much accessible to us that we can learn about and we can overcome some of these titles and hang-ups that we have and recognize the possibility of becoming human beings and that's an attitude, I'm not talking about physical, I'm talking about psychological where we are a part of everything that's around us and to deal with the best of us instead of the--the best of our personalities instead of the least of our personality.  That possibility is here.  Already we've moved in so many areas but it's hidden.  The thing that's brought to us so often is the celebrity and celebrity which goes with the athletes and entertainers and people think that's the only thing we can be.  We don't see these CEOs, we don't see these engineers and architects and designers and all these people who are a part of our society, we don't see them and somehow we have to bring that into our reality because we are a part of the human family.  And I think it's time that we take responsibility for that.

Speaker 1: Well, when you look back at what you've done so far and you're still active as an artist and as a teacher, what would you consider at this point to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Manhood takes courage, manhood takes creativity and manhood takes wisdom.  Wisdom is acquired over time but I think it's very necessary if we all are to survive on this earth.  That we understand the necessity of each other.  We are part of this thing called life and the intricacies of life and there is nothing in life that's wasted.  Everything has an absolute function and I think our generation must understand the powerlessness that's been given to us as something that is only in attitude.  That you can have all the things that this earth offers and I'm not talking about material things, I'm talking about thoughts, ideas, imaginations.  I'm talking about not trying to be, I'm talking about being.  All of these realities are part of our understanding of our human relationship to life, our involvement in life and to be responsible for that.  I think that's a part of what we must recognize and be a part of and I think that as we do that if that effort is pursued across this globe a whole new world is yet to come it's not here yet but it's yet to come.  I don't believe in superiority thus I cannot believe in inferiority because they are all a part of the same thought.  I believe in being and I think that is something I try to transfer to my students for the wonderful potential that they have if they utilize it.  Timing is so important.  We should not have to talk about tomorrow because I've never seen anybody who went to bed and woke up tomorrow it's always today, right now.  So to take advantage of our lives, take advantage of our moment we must be involved in life.

Speaker 1: Now is there anything major that you would do differently if you had to do it again?
Speaker 2: Differently? I don't really think so, I don't really think so considering my beginnings.  I'm very comfortable about feeling that I can continue to do the best that I can with that that I have and I intend to do that right to the end.  I'd like to think of the end as the beginning.  I've made mistakes but I've been fortunate enough to learn from them.  I don't know what would have happened if I hadn't made those mistakes.  I've been fortunate enough to learn from them and to witness beautiful, fantastic things in other people, other brothers and sisters, other people that have enriched my life and for that I'm grateful for it.  I feel as though I'm very, very blessed but I want to share that blessing, I don't want to hoard it, I want to share it.  To make it to this point in life, I'm approaching my seventy-third birthday in another week and to still be able to walk upright, I threw away my knee pads almost forty years ago.  So I don't have to get on my knees anymore and I don't, I haven't, I have no regrets.

Speaker 1: Sir how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I'd liked to be remembered as an African American man who attempted to be as decent a person as possible and who has tried to use his gift--his talent in a way to make society as we know it a better place, that's it.
