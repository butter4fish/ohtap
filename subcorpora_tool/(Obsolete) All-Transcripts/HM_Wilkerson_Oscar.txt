Story_ID: 34075
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask you some, just kind of what we call "People Magazine" questions and just require kind of a yes or no answer.  What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: That's difficult.  I eat a lot of chicken because I don't cook at home anymore and the chicken type places are open at weird hours and I can always get something to eat, but that's not necessarily my favorite food.  Hardly yes or no answer, but--
Speaker 1: Your answer was just fine.  What's your favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Probably spring or fall when the weather is moderate.
Speaker 1: And what's your favorite color?
Speaker 2: I don't think I have one.

Speaker 2: Most any waterfront location where it's warm.
Speaker 1: And do you have like a, a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 34076
Speaker 1: Now I want to talk a little bit about your family history.  What was your mother's name and where was she born and when was she born if you know?
Speaker 2: She was born to my knowledge, in Atlanta [Georgia].  Her name was Sarah Dulver [ph.] Elizabeth James.  And what were your other--I don't know when she was born exactly either.
Speaker 1: Do you know how the--how she spelled her first name?
Speaker 2: Sarah, S-A-R-A-H I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Did I say Sarah, Sarah Dulver Elizabeth?  She was known as Elizabeth Wilkerson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was her official long name.
Speaker 1: And you said she grew up in the Atlanta area?
Speaker 2: She, yeah, she grew up in the Atlanta area.
Speaker 1: Do you know what her background and experience was?  I mean education or occupation?
Speaker 2: No, and a correction on the--Atlanta, she was bred around in Chamblee, Georgia, which is now a part of Atlanta, but at that time was one of the suburbs of Atlanta.  And I'm not, not sure how far she went in school.  She was not in a prominent family or anything like that.  They were poor, quite poor.
Speaker 1: How would you, how would you describe her in terms of her personality?
Speaker 2: Well naturally being a mama's boy, she was a wonderful woman.  She was a wonderful woman.  I think most people who knew her would agree.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any stories that she may have told about her family or growing up in Chamblee, Georgia?
Speaker 2: No, not off the top of--in the course of conversation sometime there may be a, a subject that comes up that will recall one.  But off the top, I don't.
Speaker 1: Do you know any information about her, her parents, your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I knew her mother, and she was part Indian as many of us claim to be.  But hers was obvious, she had the high cheekbones, the whole bit.  She lived to be 102 years old I think.  And she spent her whole time in or around Chamblee.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Grandma, let me think for a moment.  Mary Coker, C-O-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: And did you have--were you able to spend time with her when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I--they moved to, to I think the Ohio area and then to Chicago Heights [Illinois] area, and that's where I was born.  My brother was born in the south, in Atlanta I believe.  He may have been born in the north.  He's 13 years older than I, and I don't remember that.  But no, I didn't spend any time down there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any recollection of your grandfather?
Speaker 2: No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Talk a little bit about--is there anybody going back past your grandparents that you're aware of or no?  Anything about--
Speaker 2: No.
Story_ID: 34077
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your father.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Oscar Lawton Wilkerson, Senior.
Speaker 1: And do you know where he was, when he was born and where he was raised?
Speaker 2: I don't know off the top when, but he was raised in the same Chamblee, Georgia area, which was on the outskirts of Atlanta [Georgia] and is now part of Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Did your parents know each other when they were growing up in Chamblee?
Speaker 2: Far as I know, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know how they first met?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: All right.  Let me step back just a minute into your mother.  What, what was her occupation?
Speaker 2: Domestic, she cleaned houses, etc.
Speaker 1: And how bout your father, what was his occupation?
Speaker 2: He worked with Armour Fertilizer Company in the Chicago area.  That, that's all I knew that he worked--worked at Bisbee Linseed Oil Company, which neither of those exist anymore that I'm, to my knowledge.  But they were in the Chicago Heights area as well.  He was injured at Bisbee Linseed Oil Company one time when a boiler of some sort blew up and pieces of metal came down, hit him in the head.  That's why I remember Bisbee.  But he died while working at Armour Fertilizer.
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about his parents?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: And do you know whether or not, or how much education he may have had?
Speaker 2: No, probably grade school at best in both cases.
Speaker 1: Did your parents ever tell you why they left Chamblee?
Speaker 2: No, I assumed it was the migration north that many of them did try to improve themselves economically.
Speaker 1: You know what year they came to Chicago?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  Had to be before 1926 cause that's when I was born and they were there.
Story_ID: 34078
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what is your earliest memory growing up in your family?
Speaker 2: Earliest memory of what?
Speaker 1: Of, you know your childhood, first, earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I was born at 1522 Fifth Avenue, and I don't know, that's a difficult one.  At some time maybe we'll come back to it and something will spring forth, but I can't think of incidents that--early ones.  I remember a little later on when I was a bigger kid and running around, things that happened that--well I can tell you about something if you're interested in something.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Other than real infant stuff.  One time my next door neighbor, we lived in, we lived on the east side of Chicago Heights [Illinois] as I mentioned, which was all--where all the blacks lived at that time, no matter what your status in life was, you lived on the east side if you lived there.  Couldn't move to the west side.  And my next door neighbor was this Lithuanian kid named Johnnie Letco [ph.].  We were ace cut buddies.  And we used to make model airplanes and fly them.  And I lived on the second floor at the time.  This was at, this was still at 1522.  And after you'd break the plane a few times and patch it up, they get to be pretty ragged, so we decided well we're gonna do something more spectacular.  They were, they were rubber band driven, by the way.  Crank it up with a rubber band and you let it fly and the, the rubber band expanded and spinned the prop and so on.
Speaker 1: Those are those balsa wood.
Speaker 2: Balsa wood covered with rice paper I guess it was, a very light paper.  So we decided we're gonna recreate one of the things that we saw in the movie, a flaming plane going down.  So we coated the trailing edge of the wing with kerosene and got up on the second floor of this, of my back porch, lit the thing and let it go.  And it's going in flame and made a nice turn and went next door to his house, and went under the--there's a little porch on the first floor.  And it went under the porch still aflame.  And his father happened to see that and went ballistic.  But that one I remember.  That was an incident.  We learned that--we did a lot of experimentation like that and sometimes we got in trouble.
Speaker 1: It didn't catch the, the porch on fire.
Speaker 2: No, it--there wasn't enough substance to the flame by the time it got down there to catch anything on fire, but it was still something we shouldn't have been doing.
Speaker 1: So you had an interest in airplanes at a very early age.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very early, yeah.
Speaker 1: About how old were you when this happened?
Speaker 2: It had to be maybe eight years old or so, I'm guessing.  I, I'm not sure.
Story_ID: 34079
Speaker 1: Now do you have any siblings?
Speaker 2: I had a brother who was 13 years older than I, yes.  His name was Rufus.
Speaker 1: And what year would he have been born, kind of count back.
Speaker 2: Subtract thirteen from 26, thirteen.
Speaker 1: 1913, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now can you describe your neighborhood?  You mentioned that it was--that's a part of Chicago Heights where most of the black people lived.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What was it east of?  Was it east of State Street or--
Speaker 2: The downtown area of Chicago Heights was essentially off of Halsted Street.  In those days Halsted Street was the way to go to get out to Chicago Heights.  There were no expressways of course.  And Halsted went straight through town where the City Hall was and the dime store and Kresge's, a couple of banks, etc.  And then everything east--there's a--the railroad track came through there too, by the way, parallel more or less to Halsted Street.  It was the C and EI [Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad] I think it was, or Illinois Central, one or the other.  And then everything east of there beginning with East End Avenue, you could--blacks could live in.  But you couldn't live west of there.  But also there were a number of white people lived there also.  Those were people who weren't fortunate enough to get away.  And we lived in a very mixed community.  My next door neighbor on one side was the Lithuanians I mentioned.  Next door, maybe the second one down was Polish.  There were a couple of--one Greek family in the neighborhood, Spathis [ph.].  They monopolized the distribution of newspapers, manually.  You know it wasn't a big business, it was just that they had a couple of kids and they, they were the ones who distributed the newspapers.  And there was a Polish bakery across, roughly across the street from me, mama and papa sort of place, excellent bakery goods.  People who did that stuff in the old country before they came over here.  But I mentioned all those to demonstrate the vers--versatile--you know the variety of people and, and nations who were represented there.  It wasn't just black but they, if they got fortunate enough, could go and live wherever they wanted to.  And our people who got fortunate enough, there were a few, they were still confined to this area.
Story_ID: 34080
Speaker 1: Tell me about some of the, say the sights and sounds and smells, either in your house or just around that neighborhood.  You said there was a, there was a train that ran through.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were a couple.  The first one I mentioned was I believe the Illinois Central.  In fact I'm more certain now that I talk more about it, that was principally a passenger service, as it still is.  And then as you proceeded further east, maybe a half mile or so from there was the B and O [Baltimore and Ohio] tracks, which was essentially a freight railroad.  And then there was 16th Street, which was the principal east/west street through the area, and 14th Street was another one.  Fourteenth Street is what is now Route 30, or it was, that was a while but it was called locally 14th Street.  When you got all the way down to the east side, the nearest thing we had to a business/commercial district was Wentworth Avenue.  That's where the activity--most that kind of activity was.  They had taverns and grocery stores and etc. on Wentworth Avenue.  I lived on Fifth Avenue, which was the next street over, next street west of Wentworth.
Speaker 1: And we were talking a little bit about your, your father and, and kind of go through again some of the, the places that he worked.  You were talking about the fertilizer company.
Speaker 2: He worked, I, I'm told in the south he worked at Armour Fertilizer.  He also worked in the, in the Chicago Heights area at Bisbee Linseed Oil Company, which was located on 22nd Street or thereabouts in Chicago Heights.  And then later he worked at the Armour Fertilizer Company there.  It seems to me the name of that fertilizer company changed too, but those were the places he worked.  He died of a heart attack and he was at that time still working at the fertilizer place.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: In the '40's [1940's], but I don't remember the exact year.
Speaker 1: About how old were you at that time?
Speaker 2: I was in the service and out, so I was probably 19 or 20.
Speaker 1: And you had left home by that time.
Speaker 2: Only to the service and came--when I came back from the service, I was back at home.
Story_ID: 34081
Speaker 1: Where did you go to elementary school?
Speaker 2: At Franklin Elementary school, which later became Gavin Elementary School, named after a local doctor, local black doctor about, a little over nine.
Speaker 1: And was that like first through sixth grade, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was first through sixth.  All--also went after that to Lincoln School, which was on Center Avenue in the same town.  Both schools, I can't remember why they split them off, but, or maybe it was because we moved I guess.  Yeah, I guess it was because we moved that I was then transferred to Lincoln School.
Speaker 1: And where, where did you move to?  You were still in Chicago Heights [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Still in Chicago Heights.  We moved to 1631 Shields Avenue in Chicago Heights, which was only about four blocks or so west of Fifth, of Fifth Avenue.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any favorite teachers in elementary?
Speaker 2: Ms. Thompson, you got that one on the head.  Her name was Ms. Thompson, she was a homeroom teacher at, at one of those schools, Lincoln I think it was.  And she was a very nice lady and looked out for us.
Speaker 1: So you, I mean you kind of got excited when you talked about her.  What--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she can--I still remember her.  She's one of the few that I remember from that far back.  In fact I guess she's one of the few that I remember period.  Later on we--in high school I remember Sears, his last name was Sears, I can't remember his first name, he was a science teacher.  And he had always came up with things that were interesting and different and that's why I remember him, and he would encourage you to explore things.
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in elementary school if you recall?
Speaker 2: Elementary school, okay I, I guess.  I don't--I've never been in too much trouble with people and I'm not trying to make myself look good.  I'm just square.  My first name is Oscar and they used to call me "Oscar the Square".  But you know, I didn't, I didn't get into too much stuff.  I guess you have to ask the question again cause I just blew it in my mind.  What'd you say?
Speaker 1: I was trying to initially ask you what kind of student you were.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  I, I was just an average student; I was not bright.
Speaker 1: And what kind, okay, what kind of child were you?  Cause you must have an interest in things because you talked about the, the airplanes that you guys flew.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think I was a pretty decent kid.  I didn't give my parents big troubles.  One of the things I used to like to do with some of my friends was go to the library, which makes it sound like I want to be better than I am, but we'd go to the library and take out bound, bound copies of Mechanics, what was the name of that magazine?
Speaker 1: "Popular Mechanics"?
Speaker 2: "Popular Mechanics", and go through those things like they were Bibles.  And they kept back issues of those things and we would go through them and find experiments that I mentioned to do and I remember we--this same kid, John Letco and myself were, were in the basement at his house and decided we're gonna try to recreate an experiment in electrolysis.  We didn't know it as, as that, but that's what we did.  So we took a piece of wood and we nailed a couple of pieces of metal onto each end of it and attached electric wires to it.  We made a salt solution and we lowered that into the salt solution with it plugged in.  Obviously it didn't get very far, it blew all the fuses and once again we were in trouble.
Story_ID: 34082
Speaker 1: And where did you go to high school?  Did you go--where did--was there a junior high then?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, where did you go--
Speaker 2: Washington School they called it.  And I think they named it after somebody else in later years, but it was Washington School.  And it was located in the downtown area.  I mentioned that Halsted Street went through the downtown area.  It was right off of, right off of Halsted Street and just off the downtown area in Chicago Heights [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Now was your elementary school or your junior high school, were they predominantly black, or were they pretty much mixed because your neighborhood was somewhat mixed?
Speaker 2: It was pretty much mixed, but it was predominantly black.  In both cases, Lincoln and, and Franklin.  But everybody went to the mid-school, Washington School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you, did you have any favorite teachers in junior high school?
Speaker 2: No, I can't remember.  There was a guy whose name I can't remember at the moment, but--I, I can't remember his name, but there was one guy who was, was nice and he was involved once again as you mentioned, I hadn't thought of it that way, but he was involved in, in the science part of the training that we had there.  I can't think of his name.
Speaker 1: Did you participate in any sports?
Speaker 2: No, I was a klutz.
Speaker 1: Okay, now from the junior high school, what high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: To Bloom[field] Township High School.  At the time the only one around there.
Speaker 1: And was that more of a, a mixed race high school at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely so.  Blacks were a minority there.  A lot of blacks dropped out by then of course for economic reasons and other reasons.  But it was mixed and a very nice school.  Very high educational level.  There were not heavy tensions there and all that kind of stuff.  It was, it was a nice school to go to.
Speaker 1: Did your parents have strong feelings about education?
Speaker 2: Yes they did and thinking back, that was kind of surprising because they did not have the education and therefore couldn't encourage me to do what they had done.  But they were aware enough to know that if you get a chance, you get as much education as you could and they felt strongly about it.
Speaker 1: Did you have any favorite subjects in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I kind of liked the, the science sorts of things.  Didn't particularly care for history, geography, those things, but those--the scientific kind of things I liked for the most part.
Speaker 1: Now you mentioned a, a, a science teacher in high school that--
Speaker 2: Mr. Sears was one of them, yeah.  Once again, I can't remember his first name either, but he was a science sort of teacher and therefore kept his students very interested in what he was putting down because he knew how to teach and keep it interesting.
Speaker 1: Do you recall some of the things he did that made science more interesting, some experiments or things that he--
Speaker 2: Not specifically, no.  It might come to me at some time, but I don't off the top.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what year did you graduate from high school?
Speaker 2: Forty Four [1944].
Story_ID: 34083
Speaker 1: Okay, and when you left high school, where did you go?
Speaker 2: Straight into the Army/Air Force.
Speaker 1: Now at 18 you were in the Army/Air Force.  Now was that somewhat unusual to be in the Army/Air Force at 18?
Speaker 2: I suppose it was.  However, the story behind that is that a good friend of mine then and now, a guy named Lewis Irons and I decided we wanted to get in the Air Force.  And the war was on and soon as you got out of high school, you would get conscripted.  In order to get into the Air Force, you had to go in, in advance and take the testing and so forth.  And if you passed it, then they would put you in the Air Force.  And we did that; passed the test.  And within--I didn't remember the specifically, but he says within a week to ten days after graduation, we were on the train going to Tuskegee [Alabama], or down to Montgomery [Alabama], actually.  And then from there we went to I think career in aviation.  But the reason why we went into the Air Force is because we made a special effort to do so prior to graduation.
Speaker 1: Now did you have any sense of, of what kind of airman you wanted to be, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted to fly an airplane.
Speaker 1: Just flying an airplane.  Did you have any knowledge about what kind of planes the, the Army/Air Force flew around those times?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I became interested in aviation early on as I mentioned with those planes that we built and burned and so on.  And, excuse me, to give a little background on that; the, there was a store in Chicago, department store in Chicago Heights [Illinois] called the Rau Store, R-A-U.  And at Christmas time they would have toys on the second floor.  And one time they had a model airplane, we'll call it a model.  It was mounted on a pylon and it had an arm that stuck out and the plane was on the end of it and this thing would go just around and around on the arm.  It had a set of controls on the side; you could make it go up and down and you could kind of land it and play with it.  And I'd go up there and play with this thing when nobody else was around; when you know, other kids didn't want to get onto it.  And I guess the guy who ran the place noticed it and so whenever somebody else wasn't on it, he'd let me come back and fiddle with it.  I remember that toy cost twenty one dollars if you wanted to buy it then.  But my folks didn't have twenty one dollars to be fooling around with a toy.  So I couldn't have one; but I would go up there and lay with that.  And that's one of the things that I did that kind of stimulated, perpetuated my interest in aviation.  Small thing, but it's one of them.
Speaker 1: So you early on had a real interest in flying and aviation.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  In high school I was a member of the CAP, Civilian Air Patrol.  There was a li--a little dinky Chicago Heights airport out there and my first time in an aircraft was at that Chicago Heights airport when some guy gave me a ride in a, in a Taylor Craft airplane; it was a two seater, a tandem, one behind the other.  And you know that really cemented the thing.  I really had to learn how to do this.
Speaker 1: And you were in high school at this time?
Speaker 2: That was in high school as I recall, yes.  They had a little airport that's no longer there.  It's part of a golf course.
Story_ID: 34084
Speaker 1: Now you, you joined the Army in 1944.
Speaker 2: Forty four [1944].
Speaker 1: And did you know about the Tuskegee Airmen at that time?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The Tuskegee Airmen.
Speaker 2: We knew where we would be going if we were able to get in the--
Speaker 1: What were your first impressions when you arrived in Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Awesome, I'm sure.  You know all of that--going there was the first time being away from home at a--for any length of time.  And all of that was a, a new experience.  So that whole thing was awesome.  You didn't go straight into Tuskegee; you went into basic training at Biloxi, Mississippi first.  And then out of there you went to Tuskegee and the various elements of training from thereon campus part of it, and the rest of it at the Air Force base there, Tuskegee Army Air Force Base.  It was part of the Army in those days.
Speaker 1: What was your experience like in Biloxi?
Speaker 2: That was not, you know we were strictly in the Army and you were in the Army on the base and you didn't get out very much to, to experience much.  I'm trying to think.  I think we'd get out on a pass maybe on the weekend for a few hours.  And I don't remember doing too much up in the town of Biloxi.  I remember one of these towns; I can't remember now whether it was Biloxi or Tuskegee itself, that you had to be on the corner--they had like a town square in the center as many towns in those days, probably still in smaller towns now.  There was a town square and you had to be on the corner where the bus stopped taking you back to the base by 10:00 at night.  And if you weren't, they would put you in jail and they'd call the military police and they'd come and pick you up.
Speaker 1: So the local police would pick you up.
Speaker 2: Local police would pick you up if you were on the corner--if you were not on that corner waiting for the bus after 10:00 at night.
Story_ID: 34085
Speaker 1: But with--I'll try.
Speaker 2: Now we're going to get started again.  I was--we were talking a little bit about your experience in Biloxi, Mississippi when you first in the Army.  I want to step back just a little bit.  Did your family attend church?
Speaker 1: Yeah, very religious family.
Speaker 2: Okay, and was there a black church in Chicago Heights [Illinois] at that time?
Speaker 1: Yeah, several.  We went to Union Evangelistic Baptist Church in Chicago Heights.  It was located on Center Avenue and 16th Place.  There was a sanctified church, couple of them, a Methodist church.  I'm speaking of black churches now.  And those are all I remember at this moment, but yeah there was several churches, there was plenty of church activity.
Speaker 2: Were you, were your parents involved a lot in, in the church?  Did your mother [Elizabeth Wilkerson] sing in the choir or anything like that?
Speaker 1: No, but they were regular church people, though, church goers.
Speaker 2: Did you sing in the choir?
Speaker 1: No.  Well let me take that back.  I think I sang in youth choirs.  There was a church called Payne Chapel which is a CME [Christian Methodist Episcopal] on Center Avenue too, bout a block or two away from my church.  And there was a woman named Nanny Webb down there who was very active in the community and she would round up kids from wherever you were and do things like having these little tots courses and stuff of that nature.  And I'd get hung up with those also.
Speaker 2: What was your, your father's [Oscar Lawton Wilkerson] personality?
Speaker 1: He was a warm sort of fellow.  He was pretty straightforward.  A straight man.  He was not a drinker, a religious person, both of my parents were.  I don't know that, that's about all I can come up with.
Speaker 2: Do you have any stories about your father, some--I mean you talked about the airplane that you lit on fire, but that was your, your friend's father that kind of saw that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I can remember one thing about my dad.  If I did something wrong, instead of cuffing me, slapping upside the head, he would kind of just tell me what I did wrong and then go silent on me.  And that had more effect on me than if it would have been if he'd hit me or something, then I could brush that off and go back doing what I was doing or whatever.  But I, I hated that and I think that that's one of the things that I carried through, no deliberately, but in my life and later years.  If people did things to me, I would--rather than try to fight them, I would just move away from it.
Speaker 2: So was your father the disciplinarian or your mother?
Speaker 1: Well I think that's a tricky one.  I think that he was the, the threat but she was the enforcer cause she was there more than he, he had to work you know.  And so did she for that matter, frequently.  But she was the one that was on the spot and fortunately when you did something wrong in those days, they, they told you about it right then and there.  And it didn't get sidelined and there was no time out and all that kind of baloney.  You did it wrong, you were going to hear about it right now.
Speaker 2: Was there a sense that people in the community would also know if you did something wrong?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the village was very prominent in those days.  And if your kids were wrong, they were wrong.  And you could discipline them up to a point.  You didn't go slappin' somebody else's kids around.  But you could tell them to stop doing something and he was disciplined enough for the most part, most of them were, that they would stop; they respected their elders.  It doesn't happen anymore, but that was true then.  So if, if an elder told you to do something, you did it whether you liked it or not.  And not only that in a small town, most of those people knew the other party, party so that if you did something wrong, you knew that you were gonna catch it right then.  You also knew that that person was probably gonna tell your parents and you're gonna catch it again when you went home.  So that was a pretty good deterrent.

Speaker 1: How would you describe your mother's [Elizabeth Wilkerson] personality?
Speaker 2: She was outgoing and I remember she would do most anything to try to get us to do what we're supposed to do, and she would go out of her way to do many of the things that we wanted to do.  One thing that comes to mind; I was fiddling with photography for many years and I had a camera.  And the trains that I mentioned come through town on the Illinois Central there was a, a--the Burlington Zephyr it was called, the train that inspired the movie "Silver Streak".  An early diesel that had a--instead of having a big black smoking engine, this thing had a diesel powered engine.  And it was more or less chrome on the outside.  Not really chrome, aluminum on the outside.  And it was a early arrival of this train coming through Chicago Heights.  I wanted to take a picture of it.  It was in the middle of the Winter, colder than all get out outside.  But I wanted to get a picture of this thing and I was too young to be running around by myself.  So she braved the cold with me, took me up to stand on that track, stand by that track, and wait until that plane, train got there so I could take a picture of it as it passed through.  And I remember that to this day.
Speaker 1: How old were you about that time?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but I was a little dude.  Too, too small to be runnin' around by myself in situations like that.
Speaker 1: But you knew how to operate a camera.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Those days, all you did was point it and press the button.  You know they didn't have all this sophistication you have on cameras nowadays.  And there were no cameras built into telephones.
Speaker 1: Was that one of those--a Brownie?
Speaker 2: "Baby Brownie".
Speaker 1: "Baby Brownie".
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a Brownie that was a larger box and then there was a Baby Brownie that was smaller and made of some plastic that if you dropped it, it would crack.
Speaker 1: And did you maintain that interest in cameras and photography?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I was a photographer around the Heights for a lifetime, take all the wedding pictures and funerals and graduations, cotillions, all that kind of stuff.  Coming out of the service, I went to the New York Institute of Photography on the GI [Government Issued] Bill and then came back here and continued in the photography while I also became an insurance man, worked in a fertilizer factory and all kinds of stuff.
Speaker 1: We're gonna come back to some of that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Between your father and your mother, which one of them do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Probably my mother.
Speaker 1: And why do you say that?
Speaker 2: Cause it's--spent more time with your mother.  Your father was out there tryin' to keep food on your table and shelter over your head.
Speaker 1: But you mentioned you, you also picked up that characteristic from your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was not--he was not present and all of that, but you spent more time with your mother cause you were there more with your mother and your father was gone tryin' to earn a living more.
Story_ID: 34087
Speaker 1: Were there any family rituals, something you did for the holidays or just that were kind of routine around your house?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was one that I--pops into mind as soon as you said that.  On New Year's when many people go out in the back and shoot their guns off or whatever they do, we always had prayer.  And we came together, we got on our knees and we prayed.  And no matter where you were, where I was, you made it back to there.  When I got to be big enough, an adult to go and party, I'd party till 11:30 or where, whatever the time it took me to get back home.  So I could be there at midnight to pray.  And if I wanted to go back to the party, on a rare occasion I may have partied all night long, but I was there at midnight.
Speaker 1: And that was throughout your childhood and--
Speaker 2: And adulthood.  Yeah, as long as I was livin' at home, that's what we did.  And unapologetically.
Speaker 1: Who led the prayer?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I think it kind of fell to each of us.  I, I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now after that, did you have like a family dinner on, on New Year's day, or--
Speaker 2: On New Year's day, yeah, but not that night.  It was just that event took place and then if you wanted to, you go back out.  I could go back out.  But yeah New Year's Day got to be a special day and there was a superstition in those days that if you wanna have good luck for the coming year, then the first person come to your house had to be a man, and he had to be worthwhile, couldn't be a shiftless individual.  Cause if he did, somebody that was--didn't fit those qualifications could bring your household bad luck for a year.
Speaker 1: I've never heard that one.
Speaker 2: You've never heard that one?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: That's an old time superstition.
Speaker 1: What if it was a woman, did that make a difference?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you didn't want a woman to be the first one that come to your house.  Had to be a man of some character, not some shiftless man.
Speaker 1: Now did you have a special meal on New Year's Day?
Speaker 2: Yeah, a lot of times I--one of the bit things for New Year's Day was chittlins or some people would call it chitterlings.  But it was chittlins.  And for those who don't know, chittlins are intestines from a hog.  And that was the thing.  I cleaned a many a chittlin' Armour chittlins by the way, it came in a ten pound tin.  And then they were pretty clean.  And then you had to go through and do a delicate cleaning so that you weren't getting a lot of husk and other things that were not too healthy.  And I've cleaned a lot of chittlins and eaten a lot of chittlins in those days.  Chittlins, corn bread, spaghetti, coleslaw.
Speaker 1: And did you have black eyed peas and rice?
Speaker 2: Black eyed peas and rice were another staple.  Black eyed peas for good luck.
Speaker 1: Were, were there any other activities that your family did together during your growing up years?
Speaker 2: Not like that ritual.  We did--always had Christmas together and the other holidays were not as structured.  Thanksgiving, we did it together.  Other holidays whenever someone in the family had a birthday, they, they tried to get something together for that.  You know it wasn't, it wasn't a party, but for the family itself, the immediate family.  They, they always had a cake or an effort at cake, you know, that kind of thing, to recognize the day in other words.
Story_ID: 34088
Speaker 1: Did your family have a car?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother had a car, a green--I don't know what kind of car it was, I think it was a Ford.  But that was the only car they had prior to me.
Speaker 1: What kind--did you like go on family vacations at all?  Did the--get to travel much?
Speaker 2: No, not, not when I was a kid, no.  We--once in a while we'd get to go to--I had relatives in Dayton [Ohio].  My uncle lived in Dayton; we'd go there.  But when I was a kid, I don't recall going there cause it was no easy way to do it, you know.  No--my brother didn't have a car at that time.  And I'm trying to remember if we ever went back south as a kid.  I think--I remember goin' back south I think once when I was around twelve years old.  And that was, was--you might call it a vacation.  My mother [Elizabeth Wilkerson] got to visit her mother and I got to meet my grandmother [Mary Coker] and that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: So you still had some relatives in Chamblee [Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, they're, they're still around there living in and around Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Do you remember anything from your visit to Chamblee?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Excuse me, it was an entirely different culture from what I was used to.  They--Chamblee was a very, very small town.  Chicago Heights was a small town and Chamblee was smaller.  And I remember going there and we spent maybe a week or so there.  They had one church, a little white church.  And I believe they had a circuit, forgot what they call him, a circuit preacher.  Anyway he didn't preach at--he wasn't assigned at one church, he went from one church to the other on a schedule.  They were still farming.  Wasn't big, vast farms.  They had a plot of land, maybe it was an acre or so, I don't, I don't know.  But I remember my uncle had a mule and I got a chance to plow a furrow behind a mule.  They did--were still growing cotton in the south at that time.  So I saw how sweet potatoes grew and all that kind of thing.  Met some--I have, had uncle, an uncle and an aunt lived there and my grandmother were the primary relatives who lived there at the time.
Speaker 1: Did they own any land?
Speaker 2: I don't think they owned the place they lived in, but I'm not sure about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did, did you ever see your aunt and uncle after, after that visit?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in later years when I became an adult, I went back to visit on occasion.  In fact I drove down there one time and took my mother in later years, it's a twelve hour drive.  That was the last time that she went to visit her mother.
Story_ID: 34089
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit--your, your brother [Rufus Wilkerson] was a few years older than you.
Speaker 2: Thirteen.
Speaker 1: What was your relationship?  Did you guys--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were--when I was a little kid, smaller kid, I always said that when I grow up and get big enough, I'm gone beat you up.  And when I grew up and got big enough, I realized what a great guy he was and he was a musician, drummer, among other things.  And of course it was growin' up and beatin' up cause he was pretty much an idol of mine by the time I got old enough to realize what was going on in the world.
Speaker 1: Did he play in any bands, or--
Speaker 2: No, nothing big time.  He, he played local clubs and that sort of thing.  I remember they--once in a while they would take a, get a flatbed truck and a guy named Tintes [ph.] played piano, Eddie Perkins played trumpet, there must have been a sax, but I can't remember the sax man.  Anyway, they would get on the back of this truck.  My brother was the drummer, and they had the base drum and the traps you know.  And they would get on the truck and they'd go down 16th Street that I mentioned earlier.  And then turn and go down Wentworth and they'd be playing their music up and down the streets there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how old were you when this was going on?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I was a little kid.  I have no idea.  I--as a wild guess, I'd say maybe twelve years old or so, but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did your brother end up doing later on his--
Speaker 2: He was a Pullman porter for a while.  What--during when times were really tough, he was a member of the CCC [Civilian Conservation Corps], CCC was like a thing that took poverty stricken people and gave them a job to do conserving--CCC stood for some kind of conserving, something conserve, conservation corp., Civilian Conservation Corps.  See, it come back.  He was a member of that for a while, which was a--was done as a relief to us cause they stayed someplace else, you know.  Like a, like an army facility sort of thing.  And they lived there.  And that took one mouth away from--didn't have to be fed.  And also it provided an income to help the family.  And that's one of the things that he did.  He worked at--think he worked for a while at the fertilizer place where my dad [Oscar Lawton Wilkerson, Sr.] worked.  What else did he do?  Those are the only occupations I can remember at the moment.
Story_ID: 34090
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  Okay let's jump back to--is there anything else about your childhood that you remember or you want to tell us about?
Speaker 2: No, but it may come back again when you hit another point like you did with the, the memorable occasions.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay let's jump a little bit forward and you're in Biloxi, Mississippi going through I guess this would have been basic training at that time.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How long was basic training then?
Speaker 2: Not very, maybe three or four weeks, very short period of time.  All you did was learn how to follow a command and how to march with the rest of the guys and how to take care of your stuff and not let your stuff get stolen by somebody else, and that kind of thing.  Cause it was as it implies, really basic training.
Speaker 1: Now the, the, the people you went with through basic training with, were they all going to be in the Tuskegee program, or were they just gonna go in the Army generally?
Speaker 2: To my knowledge, they were all pre-cadets and were, were aspiring to go into the aviation program.
Speaker 1: So they would all been, they were all black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Everything was all black.  You were all whatever you were, you know even if you were in the trenches, if you were black, you were all black.  Everything was totally segregated in the armed forces in those days.
Speaker 1: But you had white officers.
Speaker 2: White officers and later some black officers.  But the forces were separated.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay so you're in Biloxi [Mississippi] for four or five weeks.
Speaker 2: That's a guess.  I'm not certain about the time, but that's what I remember.
Speaker 1: Then you went to Tuskegee [Alabama].
Speaker 2: From there to Tuskegee.
Story_ID: 34091
Speaker 1: Tell us about your first impressions of the Tuskegee [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: First impressions, we went to Chehaw Station which was the train stopped.  And then from there to--tryin'to think.  We must have gone to the base I guess, which was maybe another seven miles or so from there.  And we were billeted there.  You took primary training, did you want to get into that at this point?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay.  We took primary training.  They, they separated us off.  Somewhere along the way we took a thing called a Stanine Test, which was something like an IQ test, it wasn't IQ test.  It was a test to test the aptitude for certain occupations.  And that was designed to try to see which people were fitted to fly.  By fitted to fly, I mean had the aptitude to fly, others had the aptitude to shoot a gun maybe or whatever.  And this Stanine score would determine which of these types of training you went into.  So a number of people who went there aspiring to fly, got separated at that point by the Stanine score.  Fortunately, I was able to stay in the, the flying category.
Speaker 1: Now was, was the flying category required the highest Stanine score?
Speaker 2: I don't know about the highest.  It, you know as I said it was not a, a--what did I just call that thing a moment ago?  What's the other test to test your--
Speaker 1: IQ.
Speaker 2: IQ test, it was not an IQ test, it was an aptitude test so it wasn't any evaluation of numbers.  It was evaluation of which path you should take because of your personality or whatever they used as a guide.
Speaker 1: Now what was your, your first training at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Well first thing we went into was primary training.  And--
Speaker 1: What did that involve?
Speaker 2: That--we went from the base onto the campus of Tuskegee.  It was a college at that time, it's now a university.  And we stayed on campus and got our meals.  All, all the livelihood thing--we stayed, did on campus.  The training was done at Moton Field which is nearby and is now a national monument.  That's not quite right, but it's a nationally maintained point of interest.  Moton Field is where you learned to fly.  Actually first effort in learning to fly.  Seems to me we were there about nine weeks.  I think each of these phases last about nine weeks.  Again, I'm not certain about the numbers, but approximately.  You--the fly--you learned to flyin' a plane called the Stearman, which is a biplane, two wing aircraft.  And it's open cockpit.  It was a tandem plane.  You sat in the front seat and the pilot--the instructor sat in the back seat.  And you had a mirror up there so you could see his face and he could see yours.  And each day you went out and you'd fly some.  You had to learn to fly that aircraft solo in eight hours of instruction, or you got washed out.  And there were also washout points like that all along the training.  So you're always under pressure to learn.  They used to say that anybody can learn to fly, you just had to learn to fly and learn in the length of time that we had to devote to trying to learn.  If you couldn't learn it that quickly, then you step aside and let the next guy up.
Speaker 1: So you only had eight hours of training before you actually took a flight?
Speaker 2: Before you actually flew the plane yourself solo.
Speaker 1: Solo.
Speaker 2: Yeah, by yourself.
Story_ID: 34092
Speaker 1: What kind of classroom training or classroom instruction did you have to, to learn about, you know--aerodynamics and things like that?
Speaker 2: You began, you began in that also at the same time.  The, the classroom activities took place on the campus in some instances, and then also at Moton Field.  But there was--each day you had ground school, and then you had flight school.  So while some of the guys were on the ground doing ground school, the other part would be flying and then they flip.
Speaker 1: Now what was ground school?  What was--what did that encompass?
Speaker 2: Ground school.  That was where you learned about aircraft and the--why the airplanes stayed in the air and how you maintain it and why you check this, that and the other, and what the controls did when you moved them, etc.
Speaker 1: Were all the instructors at that time white?
Speaker 2: No, my instructor was a guy named Charlie Johnson, he was black.  They, they had a mixed force of instructors.
Speaker 1: And how many times did you fly with an instructor?
Speaker 2: In the beginning, daily.  And then after you got your time in, after you had eight hours of training, then you flew with an instructor to develop your skills and then while you're doing that, part of the time you're also flying solo to polish your skills.  So--
Speaker 1: That didn't seem like a lot of training time.
Speaker 2: No it wasn't.  Eight hours is kind of swift, and particularly you know if you're flying a small plane, a light plane like now if you're flying a Cessna, that's one--a Cessna's a--or, or Piper.  The smaller aircraft was lower power and a more forgiving aircraft.  So that's one thing.  But when you fly something like a Stearman, that's a, a little bit of an advanced aircraft for somebody to solo in, a higher power, heavier aircraft, and it was a sturdy aircraft, though.  It's one of the reasons why they had it--but to learn to fly that in eight hours was a pretty good accomplishment.
Speaker 1: What was the maximum altitude of one, of Stearman?
Speaker 2: I don't know, but that was not a consideration for the most part cause you, you flew on--you went up and you tried to learn to do smooth turns and then later on you learned acrobatics, rolls and loops and all that kind of stuff.  So all your stuff was done above 3,000 feet so that you'd have--so you wouldn't annoy the people for one thing.  So that you have space to recover when you goofed.  But the height of the--your ceiling was not a very much of a consideration.  All your activity was done at levels that were lower than that at that stage.
Story_ID: 34093
Speaker 1: Could you just walk us through exactly what that training was and when you got in that, that plane for the first time and you know, what your feeling was number one, and what you had to do to you know, to take off, to land.  What was that experience?
Speaker 2: Well that, that was a, a thrill you know.  As I mentioned, I had flown before, not on my own, I had a ride in an aircraft before and knew something, a little bit about how airplanes were supposed to work.  And been following in movies and that kind of thing, so had an idea about what you thought flying was.  You get down there and you get this instructor, in this case Charles Johnson, and you get in the plane on the first day.  The guy's gonna take you on an orientation flight.  And you're flying around and you get away from the field and up above 3,000 feet and he says do you know anything about airplane?  And I told him yeah, you know a little bit.  And we learned the stuff on the ground control with the stick and the rudder and all that.  So he says okay you got it.  And you know that wasn't unusual cause 3,000 feet gives you--no matter what happens, you got a lot of room.  So I'm flying along and I had been interested in aviation and I knew that if you want to, to roll the aircraft, well you put the stick to one side and kick a little rudder in there and the plane would roll and do like that.  Well I decided I was gonna roll the aircraft since I was--my control.  I didn't bother to mention to him that that's what I was getting ready to do.  And I did it, started it.  And we got upside down and he went to grab the controls and his hand hit this, the latch on his seatbelt.  Everybody--when you get in the plane, you latch yourself in.  And it knocked his harness a loose.  And we're upside by then and I look up in the mirror and I see his face in distress and he's cussing, foaming at the mouth so mad.  And I didn't know how to roll it back out, and I, I know if you kept it over there, but then you know I'm holding--he's holding onto the stick or whatever he had to do to keep from falling out of the aircraft.  And the only way we get out of this thing since I mentioned I knew how to get into it but I couldn't complete the roll because of what happened, was to spread us out as they call it.  And that was to pull back on the stick, split ess is you're inverted and then you just do like that, which is part of an ess configuration.  So we split ess out.  Here I had pulled back on the stick, came out and he's up there and he's fuming at the mouth.  He's mad and he's cussing.  You tried--that so-and-so.  I won't get into what it was he called me, tried to kill me.  Take me back to the field.  So he got himself latched back in and we went back to the field, landed and the cadets were all down there waiting on the line, you know, to see their buddies come back in after their training period.  And he jumped out of the plane and said that so-and-so tried to kill me.
Speaker 1: And this was your first flight?
Speaker 2: That was the first orientation flight.  So I started off very poorly.  But in the end he was, he was my good buddy and the part of that whole thing of him ranting and raving was part of a demonstration I'm sure.
Speaker 1: Wow.  Did you actually land the plane?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  You don't even begin to land a plane at that stage.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, they gave you the controls when you're up at an altitude and I just--they probably still do that in training now just to let you do--you can, you can give anybody the controls once you get the altitude.  And if you know anything at all, in fact the kids nowadays can fly a lot easier probably than we did because they're doing all these computer games and stuff.  And a lot of that is essentially the same thing you do in, in flying.
Speaker 1: So he had controls in, in the back seat.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, all the controls are duplicated in the--in almost all the way in training.
Speaker 1: So did--would he have done the takeoff also?
Speaker 2: He did the takeoff, he did all of the flying in, in your first few hours of flight.  He did all of the flying.  And you sometimes would hold the controls lightly so you could feel what inputs he was putting into there.  But you didn't take off or land early on.  The landing phase is tricky.  Most anybody can takeoff, you can describe takeoff and you go out there and take off soon as you learn to keep the thing on the runway and when the plane is ready to fly, it flies.  But coming back in is a whole 'nother story.  And landing requires some skills and, and judgment as to where you are and how you get down on the ground safely and keep it there.  So landings came a little bit further down in the training, but well within the first eight hours.
Speaker 1: Now when you landed--when the two of you landed, what were you feeling?  Did you think you were gonna get washed out at that point, he was so mad at you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, I thought that was it.  I made my first orientation flight and I thought it was all over.  But he kept me.
Speaker 1: And what did the other cadets say when they heard about what you did?
Speaker 2: I got teased a lot.  Yeah, tried to kill the instructor.
Story_ID: 34094
Speaker 1: What was your next flight experience?
Speaker 2: Well on the same thing while we're still in primary, we went through and learned all the phases of flight as you mentioned, the takeoff, the landings, making proper turns, coordinated turns and learned to stall.  Stall is when you pull off and the plane loses flight and it falls, and you got to learn that cause you don't want it to happen near ground and you crash.  And you--I don't think we did any aerobatics at that early stage of the game, just trying to keep the plane--get it up and get it back down in one piece.
Speaker 1: So you didn't have any wing walkers or anything.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, none of that stuff.  But as we approached the eight hour of training period, when we got to it; I don't know exactly, don't remember exactly where it was that I was soloed as they call it.  This is a grass strip, by the way, at Moton Field at that time.  And so at the end of one of the landings--or you would practice landings with the instructor sitting in there of course.  You had to practice till you got good enough and he had an air of confidence that you could get the plane up/down, up there and back down safely without tearing up the aircraft and killing yourself.  So he would--you'd taxied down in the thing and you'd go and do another.  And when I--takeoff and landing after another, just to get your skills.  That's all you did, was fly in pattern and do it over and over.  So one day we did that and we got down to the end of the runway and he says stop here, and I stop, you know he unbuckled his stuff he get out and he said all right fool, go kill yourself.  And that was my introduction to solo.
Speaker 1: What were you feeling at that point when you knew you were gonna be up there by yourself?
Speaker 2: Yeah well I was apprehensive at first, and then, then I also get elated, look at me, I'm gonna do it and I did--I got up there and, and made my first circuit of the field and landed safely.  As I recall, they had to make three of them while there you know and taxi back to where he was standing he'd tell you to go ahead.  If you got the first one down and it looked fairly decent from where he was, then you'd shoot another.  As I recall, you took, did three solo landings and then, then he'd crawl back into the plane and went back to the line.
Speaker 1: So did you just circle the field or did you go--
Speaker 2: No, you just circle the field, stayed in the pattern and tried to get the thing up in the air and back around and down again.  That's all your requirement was.  And if you could do that, then, then you could go on.  If you couldn't do that, well it was over.
Speaker 1: How many people were in your class do you recall?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember originally, but I we're leaning is that two thirds of all the people started off at that point, got washed out over the whole training.  Not at, not at that level, but at the whole training.  Two thirds of us were washed out before we got our wings at the end.  I don't remember what that number was, though.
Speaker 1: When you were in--at Moton Field, did you always fly Stearmans?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's all they had there.  Everything in training at that point was a Stearman.
Speaker 1: Do you recall were there any crashes in your class?
Speaker 2: I don't recall any crashes in my class, no.
Speaker 1: Everybody got through safe.
Speaker 2: Everybody, yeah everybody got through; there were no crashes.  I'm trying to think where--I'm not sure anyone go washed out at that point.  I can't remember anyone getting washed out, they may have.  It--the thing gets to be, or maybe I was just selfish, but the thing gets to be a concentration on what you're doing cause it was intense.  And you knew that the slip you make could wash you out, so there was a lot of--not too much at least on my part, of everything else that was happening cause I was concentrating too much on trying to make this thing work for me.  And maybe, maybe that was a selfish thing on my part, I don't know.  But I just didn't happen to notice other things.
Story_ID: 34095
Speaker 1: All right we're going to go back on, on the record.  Now you've done your first solo flight and you almost killed the instructor, at least in his-- Yeah.
Speaker 2: In his eyes.  What was it like, like in the barracks amongst the, you know your friends and your, your fellow students?  What was the atmosphere?
Speaker 1: Well I think it was, it was kind of tense cause most of us--it was like our first time away from home.  We're on our own and all that.  Remember there was a guy who was known around the Chicago area named Silas Purnell.  Did a lot of civic stuff here in Chicago after the war.  He was on base when I went there and one of the first things he told me, he was there already, already.  One of the first thing he told me that you have to take care of yourself here and you know watch out.  And I remember I--after a day or so when you had, had to--you did your own washing, by the way.  And you wash some stuff and you hang it out on the line.  But you don't just hang it out on the line and come back a couple hours later and pick it up cause you could wash it, hang it out on the line and come back a couple hours later and it's gone.  So he was one of the ones that taught me that you have to kind of watch your own back.  And even though there was camaraderie between the people who were in this situation, the other cadets and so on, there still were people who were--came from different walks of life than you might have and they didn't know the boundaries that you might be trying to impose on yourself.  They would clip you if they could.
Speaker 2: Did you have a sense, or did the cadets at that time have a sense of how important this was to be you know, some of the first black pilots in the Army Air Force?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I believe so.  It was important to us, but we were at the end of the string.  The black pilots that made all this reputation that we are looking at now, came through, through ahead of us and they were members of the Fighting 99th and the Fighting 332nd.  And they went overseas and they risked their lives and some were killed and some were captive and imprisoned.  And they're the ones that built the reputation that those of the rest of us try to perpetuate.
Speaker 2: How much did you--did your group know about the 99th and the 332nd?
Speaker 1: We knew about them, yeah.  Some of them would get back, came after we got in--out on the actual Air Force base.  Would come back through there and you know they were, they were like rock stars came through there.  This is Daniel "Chappie" James, or this is so-and-so.  And yeah they were, they were looked up to.  We knew about them.
Story_ID: 34096
Speaker 1: Did you get like reports on some of their exploits?  Did that come back through in the, in the Army newspapers or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure it did, but once again, most of us were concentrating so much on trying to keep from getting washed out that almost everything else was kind of secondary.
Speaker 1: You were getting a lot of first hand information because of these guys coming back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We'd see them when they come back, come back to base and I guess they would come back to base to see look what I, you know, look what I came through, I'm back here.  I'm sure they came back a little bit to kind of show, you know, I'm with the 99th.  And we used to have marching cadences they called.  You march, fight, fight, fight, the fighting 99th, and so on.  And we revered those guys, and particularly 99th.  I don't know why the 99th got the name more than the 332nd, the 99th I guess was a part of the 332nd.  But they were the ones who made the reputation that we were trying to perpetuate.
Speaker 1: Did they ever bring any of those, those planes back that they were flying?  Cause you say you always had Sternums.
Speaker 2: Stearmans, yeah.
Speaker 1: Stearmans, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well different--I'm sure some of them did make it back.  I'm not sure how practical it was to bring those things they actually flew back.  I know I, I saw them later years that some of the stuff that was left over from World War II, they just junked it cause it was impractical to bring back.  But they did have some 51s on this side that were probably never left the area, but here again I'm guessing.  In training when I first got to the Air Force base, they were training in P40s, which is a fighter plane also, but one that was used well ahead of the P51.
Speaker 1: But you guys didn't get to train in those?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  When you go through at primary at Moton Field you train exclusively in Stearmans biplane.  Metal and fabric cover and an open cockpit.  And then when you went to basic, that was back out to the Army Air Force base and you moved off campus back to the base, and this plane was the PT17 I think it was.  They used to call it the Vultee Vibrator.  It had a fixed landing gear and lowering plane, monoplane, and a closed cockpit and a lot of power.  And you trained in that thing for basic.  And then normally in the years prior to me, they went from there to advanced and they flew AT6s, the Texan, which is pretty famous and still flying a lot.  That was a retractable gear, low wing aircraft, a two seater, tandem with enclosed cockpit.
Story_ID: 34097
Speaker 1: So when did you leave Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: When did I leave Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Yeah you said you were, you were there for like--
Speaker 2: You mean the inst--the Tuskegee Institute.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I think I said college before it was Tuskegee Institute, not college.
Speaker 1: Basic training, you went--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did nine weeks in--at Tuskegee Col--Institute's campus, and then we went from there for basic and all the rest of the training was out of the Air Force base.
Speaker 1: And what is the name of the Air Force base at that time?
Speaker 2: Tuskegee Army Air Force Base, TAAF.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did you have, have a sense of what the environment was around Tuskegee?  You know in the civilian areas?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think that the, the airmen were well thought of there.  We would go into town on occasion when you had a chance and we were treated nicely.  And I hear a lot of people talk about all the segregation and all of that.  Well from my point of view, I didn't experience very much segregation cause you can't get segregated if you're all in just one bunch, you know.  There--if you were in a group where you were--or in a situation where you were a minority or whatever, then you get segregated.  But you can't segregate when you're in a group like that. So we didn't experience, I didn't experience that much segregation.  If it was there, then I was too dumb to realize it.  It was there; I'm sure of that.  I'm not saying it didn't happen.  I'm just saying that in a situation when you're--everybody around you is just like you are, then segregation does not loom its ugly head as much.
Speaker 1: So when you went into town there wasn't a sense of--I mean--
Speaker 2: In town that was another story.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what I'm trying to get at.
Speaker 2: In town we're back to where there was a, a, a town square type thing, a little park thing in the middle of the, the town.  And usually they had--like on a college campus, which you're probably familiar with.  They--the diagonal walkways across it and so on.  And you took a civilian, or took a bus back to camp when you came back in.  And once again, if you were on that corner after a given time, I think it was around 11:00 or so there, you better be waiting for that bus.  Otherwise you're in big trouble and they weren't gonna do much to you, except to grab you and hold you until the, the police, the Air Force police came to pick you up, the military police.  Take you back to base and then process you for being off base beyond the time that your leave allowed you to be.
Speaker 1: So if--you, you guys basically had curfews.
Speaker 2: Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, no, no question about that.  Definitely so.
Speaker 1: When you were there, were there any incidents involving any of the cadets in the town that were you know, that got them in trouble with the, with the local townspeople or the local authorities?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't remember any.  I'm sure there were times when the, when guys were stopped and apprehended until the bus could pick them up.  That probably happened with some frequency.  I don't know that it did.  But I don't remember any kind of a major event, no.  I think that most of the buys--well that's kind of--I was gonna say most of the guys in the training, but not everybody there was in training that was on the base, you know.  And now that I think about it, it's kind of like the impression used to be that the only Tuskegee Airmen were those people who flew.  And that's not true. Tuskegee Airmen--for every guy that's in the air, it took at least ten on the ground to keep him up there and they're all Tuskegee Airmen.  So when I say that we were too busy trying to get those wings to do all that other stuff, that didn't mean some of the other guys who were just doing the other jobs that's necessary to keep us up there, were not--they had more time to do things than perhaps and could get into trouble in town or anywhere else they wanted to I guess.  So my point of view is pretty, pretty narrow.  And I didn't even realize that until later years looking back and finding out--realizing that I wasn't just the only one up there, there were other people there that kept me up there.
Story_ID: 34098
Speaker 1: Were all the mechanics trained at Tuskegee also?
Speaker 2: No, they were trained at other places.  In fact I think the first mechanics group were trained at Chanute Field I believe.  But no, they were not all trained there.
Speaker 1: And where was Chanute?
Speaker 2: Chanute's in Rand--near Rantoul here in Illinois.
Speaker 1: They came--
Speaker 2: That's where the whole thing began as a matter of fact.  The, the first four I believe it was, guys started there and then they shipped them down to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I, I never knew that one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I didn't either till after I got out and I learned in recent years while being a member of the Chicago Dodo Chapter.
Speaker 1: You finished your, your training at Tuskegee and now you're going to the airfield for your more advanced training.  What was your first impression when you got there?
Speaker 2: Here again, living in the barrack situation was different from living in a dormitory on campus.  And you had more restricted activity there.  You had to comply with more rules and you had to keep your bunk and area clean and straight and footlocker had to be intact.  And you had the reveres and all these--everything was structured, very structured.  And it was--it took a little getting used to at first and plus all of the--
Speaker 1: Okay just tell me a little bit more about your experience at the airfield.  This is Tuskegee Army Airfield at this point and you're going through some more training.  Tell us a little bit about the training and what it involved.
Speaker 2: Well depend on what phase of training you were in, you learned in certain phases how to fly cross-country.  That's fly from your base to any place else.  One of the things you did in Grounds School was to learn AI as it was called Aircraft Identification; to be able to spot your enemy aircraft and tell them from your own aircraft.  You had to do that and do it in a hurry because if it was a--if you were flying in a situation and you ran into some enemy aircraft, you wanted to be able to either evade them or attack them or whatever.  And you sure didn't want to shoot your own guys down, so AI was an important part of what you learned.
Speaker 1: What was the first phase?
Speaker 2: The first phase in basic was to continue your skills and actual flight.  You learned aerobatics, you learned form, began to learn formation flying.  And learning that particular aircraft.  Getting comfortable in the, in the aircraft you were in at that phase of training.
Speaker 1: And what type of aircraft were they then?
Speaker 2: In basic you were in the Vultee Vibrator that I mentioned.  And that's all you flew for the next, let's say nine weeks.  And if you made it through there, and people got washed out in basic, by the way.  Made it through there, you went to the T6, the Texan with retractable air--retractable undercarriage, landing gear, which added another element to what you were doing.  Did that for about nine weeks and then before my class came along, they used to train--advanced training.  They would split it off and part of the guys trained in P40s, which was at that time a pursuit aircraft.  They were single engine, and then they split it off to double, to twin engine.  And they flew PT18s, which was a tail dragger as we call it, two main wheels with a little wheel on the back end.  And when my class came along I thought my class was the first one in advanced training twin engine, I was a twin engine pilot.  I thought my class was the first one to fly B25s which at that time was still a tactical aircraft.  But it turns out in later years I found out that was not true.  I think there were like two classes ahead of mine that flew B25s in training.  In any event, we thought we were really top stuff cause we were--we're not flying that trainer with the tail dragger.  We were flying a tactical aircraft.  And it was harder to fly and but once accomplishing that, you felt pretty proud of yourself.
Story_ID: 34099
Speaker 1: Tell us about the classroom training at the first level.  How much classroom instruction did you have?
Speaker 2: You had the classrooms as I recall daily, cause there was always stuff to learn and you learned about the aircraft; you learned about flying in general.  You learned about navigation.  In the upper areas of training you learned how to fly range stations as they were called then.  They were four legged ranges that you used to fly from one point to another.  And the further you went on into your training, the more of these things you got in Ground School.  So Ground School was something you had all the time.  It, it advanced along with your skills in aviation.
Speaker 1: Did you have any black instructors at this point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah there were a great number of black instructors and also white instructors.
Speaker 1: Were many of the black instructors from the 332nd or the 99th when they were coming back?
Speaker 2: No.  All those guys I believe for the most part they were civilians.  You know, had been civilians.  Now where they came from, I don't know.  But they were not fighter pilots or, or Tuskegee combat pilots coming back to instruct, no.
Speaker 1: And what was the second phase of, of training?
Speaker 2: Second phase would have been, let's see, basic and advanced training.  And that's where they--you would split off and go into either single or a twin engine flying.
Speaker 1: And what, what was the difference between the basic training and the advanced training at this point?
Speaker 2: The aircraft, the complication of, use of the aircraft, the complexity of the aircraft was different from basic to advanced.  You had retractable gear, higher power and a mixture of controls to contend with and prop settings, etc., that you didn't have on the plane that you flew prior to that.  Each time you stepped up, you added another level of complexity.
Speaker 1: Again, after the advanced training, what was the next level of training?
Speaker 2: After the advanced training, you got put into whatever unit you were gonna to fly into if you made it that far.  And then you would, you know, get shipped overseas or wherever the fighting was.
Speaker 1: At what point in the training did you learn about using aerial combat and using weapons?
Speaker 2: I suppose that would have been after we--in fact I know it would have been after we graduated and got the wings.  And then you didn't stop training at that point.  The trick was to get the wings first of all.  And we didn't go into any combat activities, other than the fact you learned to maneuver.  You know you learned aerobatics and how to get out of a spin control, for instance, prevent stalls and all of these basic things that would apply as you advanced into combat.  And you--in order to get the wings, you had to know all of that.  And then in the actual combat training when you're flying on the other aircraft or dummy aircraft and so on, that came later on.  When I was, when I got my wings and, and got out of the service, the war in Europe was over and I didn't see any of that, so I don't know what happened after that.
Speaker 1: Now was your basic and advanced training, was that all at Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 34100
Speaker 1: And when did you guys leave Tuskegee?  You were--what was the unit that you were assigned to?
Speaker 2: I was in the 447, and that's part of--the head of our unit part of it, and we graduated in 45F, which was August of 1945.  I thought for many years that we were the last class to get through there, but I found later that that was not so.  It just slowed down after our class did.  And I believe there may have been as many as six classes that graduated after we did, although they were smaller and spread out more than ours.  We used to have a graduation I believe about every nine weeks, they had a graduation about every nine weeks.  After that, it kind of spread out and that whole program was slowing down and coming to an end.  In my case, they didn't know what to do with B25 pilots, so they shipped us around quite a bit.  I was assigned to the Officer's Club.  I got to be the lifeguard at the pool when we were--we were shipped to at one point to Columbus, Ohio, Lochburn Army Air Force Base, and I was a lifeguard at the pool they had there.
Speaker 1: Let me back up just a little bit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When, where, when did you leave Tuskegee and where did you go from there?
Speaker 2: I left after August of '45 [1945].  I think it was around December, but I'm not sure.  But while there, they didn't know what, as I mentioned, what to do with us cause we were in there as AUS, Army United States, we were temporary in the first place.  I would love to have stayed in the Air Force, but I could not cause we were superficial.  So one of the things that we did while I was still there was to fly a bunch of B25s out to Kingman, Arizona to be mothballed, where the remains of them still are, by the way.  You can Google it and see them on the ground.  Then they sent me to Columbus, Ohio.  Once again, they didn't know what to do with us.
Speaker 1: I'm going back a little bit farther than that.  When you left Tuskegee, where was your next base, or next--
Speaker 2: Columbus, Ohio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you go to Michigan also?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You never were in that group, okay.
Speaker 2: All that happened I think before, in fact I'm certain it was well before that time.
Speaker 1: So from Columbus, was that your last stop?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you never went to Goodman Field?
Speaker 2: Nope.
Story_ID: 34101
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did you finally get out?
Speaker 2: In December of, December '46 [1946] I believe it was.
Speaker 1: When you were in Columbus, did you hear about the, the Freeman Field evening?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you actually got your wings, what, in Columbus?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, where did you get your--
Speaker 2: You get your wings at Tuskegee.  Everybody got their wings at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: So you had to go back there to actually get your wings?
Speaker 2: No, you got--you didn't get out of there until you got 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Or got washed out, as the case may be.  Everybody that flew in the 99th and the 332nd and whatever followed, got their wings from--whatever follows pretty general, in that era, era, you came through Tuskegee, period.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you're getting out in '46 [1946]?
Speaker 2: Forty five [1945], '45 [1945], I got out of the service in early '46 [1946], yes.  I believe it was December.
Speaker 1: What did you do next?
Speaker 2: Came back home, worked in industry, I worked at a funeral parlor, worked as an insurance man.  I was the first black bus driver in the South Suburban Safeway Lines.  And I worked in broadcasting and retired from NBC radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's, let's take each one of those in kind of a progression.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Your first job when you got back home was what?
Speaker 2: I believe I went to work at Owens Illinois Glass Company.  That was in Chicago Heights, they obviously made glass and I was a laborer, worked there.  And worked there for quite a while.
Speaker 1: Was that a number of years, or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm trying to remember now, I, I don't recall.  Several years, yeah.  And after that, the next job--I worked at Polk Brothers, which was a big department store here in Chicago in those days, and I worked in the Camera Department there.  I went to, to the New York Institute of Photography on the GI Bill and came back, but I didn't get a job in photography.  Would like to have gotten a job in aviation, but they weren't taking blacks in aviation at the time.
Speaker 1: What year did you go to the New York Institute of Photography?
Speaker 2: In '46 [1946], the latter part of '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: And how long was that?
Speaker 2: I was there maybe six months or something.  A relatively short course.
Speaker 1: What made you decide to go there?
Speaker 2: Because I'd been in photography since a kid.  I wanted to do something was gonna pay me some money, give me an occupation, and that was a choice one to do.
Speaker 1: So at that point did you want to be a photographer?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, you come back to Chicago Heights.  What, what did you do next?
Speaker 2: Worked at that glass company I told you about.
Speaker 1: And what was your--how long were you there?
Speaker 2: A year or two.
Speaker 1: What was your next--
Speaker 2: The next thing after that was Polk Brothers where I sold cameras in the Camera Department.  Then I was a bus driver for South Suburban Safeway Lines.
Speaker 1: How long were--how long did you do that?
Speaker 2: I did that for, as a driver for about seven years driving down the Loop and out to southern suburbs.  After that I was a mechanic for the same company, an apprentice mechanic for the same company for a year or two.  Then I went into broadcasting for Rollins Broadcasting, WBEE in Harvey, Illinois.
Speaker 1: How did you get into broadcasting?
Speaker 2: I went to broadcast school here in Chicago, Chicago--I've forgotten the name of the school, it was run by a guy named Ed Robbins.  And then I got the job at WBEE Radio, I was a weekend man.  They called me Weekend Wilkie.  I was--it was a daylight station, it was on from sun-up to sundown, winter and summer, which I mean winter got to be a short time, the summer time was like twelve hours long or longer sometimes.
Story_ID: 34102
Speaker 1: Okay, let me ask it in a very--so you saw--did you see Red, "Red Tails"?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was your, what was your, your, your feeling about that film?
Speaker 2: "Red Tails" was an adventure film.  It was not a documentary, nor was it ever intended to be.
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me what it was like then.
Speaker 2: "Red Tails"?
Speaker 1: No, no, not "Red Tails," the experience.  What was, what--if it were the documentary, what would I have seen?
Speaker 2: If it were the documentary, you might have seen something with more like a picture made by the same guy called "Double Victory".
Speaker 1: I saw that.
Speaker 2: That was the documentary.
Speaker 1: That was the documentary.  But what would I have seen?  Can you take me back?
Speaker 2: Not that vaguely, no.  If you're going to ask some specific questions, I'll try to answer 'em, but you know what you would have seen.  That's what that documentary, two hours long, tried to encompass.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well I saw the documentary.  I saw the documentary.  I saw a lot of the people featured in the documentary.  Why was--there's a lot of lore about the, you know, the Tuskegee Airmen.  They've become you know, they've almost--they've almost become mythological in many ways.  It almost representational about what, what, what they mean to society, what they meant.  And you know you talked earlier about how you did not appreciate at the time the people who were on the ground and, and the people up in the air.  How many people actually flew in your, in your unit?
Speaker 2: Overall in training at Tuskegee, there were 900--9,992 pilots trained.  That number varies by four.  Originally I was told 996, however, pilots as I also mentioned, only constitute one tenth or less of the people who are Tuskegee Airmen cause you can't stay in the, in the air if you don't have any people supporting on the ground.  So you know--
Story_ID: 34103
Speaker 1: Now you said 9,000 were trained to fly?
Speaker 2: Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety two.
Speaker 1: Were flo--were trained to fly.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so how many people were on the ground then?
Speaker 2: Ten times that, plus.
Speaker 1: Ten, okay.  So you're saying the whole, whole contention of, of Tuskegee Airmen is about--that would be almost 50,000.
Speaker 2: Yeah, whatever the math comes to be, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This, this is support people that keep that plane in the air.
Speaker 1: And for each--so what, what did it take one to fly and how often were you flying when you were flying?  Even the, the practice drills.  How--what, what was that regiment like?
Speaker 2: Flew virtually every day.  And when you're early in training, your instructor every day.  Then you'd go out after you've soloed and you'd fly and practice those things that you were taught by the instructor.  So you flew every day.  And for most of the time you also had ground school courses to take every day.  Learning flight, learning about the aircraft you were flying, and the many facets of keeping you in the air so that emergencies come along, you'll be able to take care of 'em and all of that is bound together to make one pilot.
Speaker 1: And so during the time that--were there any accidents that happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and do you remember like the worse accident that happened?
Speaker 2: I remember there were in--not in my advanced class, but in some advanced class the cadets were flying T6's, the aircraft that I mentioned that was the first one with the retractable gear.  Flying formation and somebody got too close and they clipped wings.  The--one of the pilots was able to get out and ejected and I don't, I don't mean eject like in the jet when you pull a handle and you get shot out.  You had to put the canopy back, get your harness off and get out of the plane.  He didn't manage to do so and he went down with the aircraft.  I don't recall who that was or what class it was, but that did happen, may have happened more than once.  I, I know about that one.  There have been other lesser accidents and people weren't killed.  I was involved in one myself, but obviously I was not killed.
Speaker 1: You mean when you say you were involved in one, you were involved an accident and you came, and you came down with the plane.
Speaker 2: We were flying in advanced training and I was, we were doing night landings.  Part of the training involved flying at night and they put you in the air and they would give you a segment to fly in until it was your time to come back to the field and land.  So you'd circle in that quadrant and they would call you in to land.  Well there was somebody--when they finally called me in to land, there was somebody ahead of me as there always is.  You land and you do what they call touch and goes.  You make a--what would be a perfect landing except you don't stop.  You just pull the coat on and you take off and you go around again in order to save time; you're not taxiing on the ground.  The guy ahead of me landed and was supposed to have taken off to go ahead and he didn't.  And then the--I believe the tower told him to clear the runway, but he also didn't do that.  And in the meantime they had cleared me to land and I didn't know that he was still on the runway.  And when I landed, I see this guy ahead of me and I attempted to pull up to get a--away from hitting him.  My landing gear clipped his--part of his canopy and both planes went over upside down.  But I--both of us survived that.  He got a big bump on his head and they had to shave part of his hair off, which was his major injury.  And nothing happened to me.  That was the crash I was involved in.  But I'm sure there were others.  I was about to say many, but probably not many; there were others.
Story_ID: 34104
Speaker 1: So how many, how many planes were in the fleet there?  I mean how many planes were at Tuskegee that you--
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: You don't know, okay.  And do you remember--now who was in charge at the point that you were there?
Speaker 2: The head man was Avril [ph.] Parish.  He was white.  In later years General Leo Davis, the pilot, was in charge; but not while I was there.  I don't remember any other officer's names who were up there.
Speaker 1: Okay, did--were you in the same--I know you didn't fly, but when I first was working on the project I had the--I interviewed a man named Bill Thom, Colonel Bill Thomas, Thompson.  You don't know--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  He never flew, though you know, but he had been very active with the Tuskegee Airman chapter here, but he had never flown.  So he was one of the people.  But he was one of the chief documentarians, and a lot of his things ended up in the Air and Space Museum.  So when that happened, did that shake you up a little bit, the whole--you know the accident?
Speaker 2: No, not particularly.  It's something that happened.  I couldn't avoid it.  If it had been something that was my fault, I would have gotten washed out, but obviously I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Apparently the other guy didn't either, so I think it was a problem with the tower.
Speaker 1: But in the case where someone died, was that--was--do you remember a big like hubbub about that or how did they handle that?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: No, okay.  So did you fly--you flew, you flew abroad in the war.  Did you fly during the war?
Speaker 2: No.  The war in Europe was over before I got my wings.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And when I got my wings, they didn't know what to do with us and eventually sent us back home.
Speaker 1: So that happened a lot, okay.  So did you at that point think or try, or was there any thought that you could become a pilot on, or attempt to become a pilot for either a commercial airlines or, or a, a carrier, freight carrier?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was, that would have been the next step.  But when I got out, they weren't even interviewing blacks for any commercial aviation flights, period.
Speaker 1: And you came out in what year?
Speaker 2: '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Forty six [1946].  So that's how you ended up working, you know you were talking about working at I think, what'd you say, Polk Brothers?
Speaker 2: Various places, Polk Brothers and a funeral parlor and an insurance company and bus company, etc., etc.
Speaker 1: But, and that lasted over what period of time, those various jobs, you know sundry jobs?
Speaker 2: I don't know, a decade or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 34105
Speaker 1: You know what I find interesting though, is that you have the Tuskegee Airmen, but you really--you have a, a fabulous career, you know, in, in broadcasting.  And so that's what I would like to sort of, you know, talk to you about.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well when I got out of the service after they didn't need me anymore, I on the GI Bill went to the New York Institute of Photography.  You asked about the broadcasting, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's what I did.
Speaker 2: After the period of doing the various jobs that I mentioned here in Chicago, during that time I went to a broadcast school here in Chicago that was run by a fella named Fred Robbins.  I've forgotten the name of the broadcasting school, but it was on the south end of Wabash.  And they trained--they had--I think Sid McCoy was one of the instructors, John Doremus was one of them, and a number of other people who became prominent television and radio broadcasters here in Chicago came through that school.  I took the course and I got a job as a weekend broadcaster at WBEE radio, located and now in Harvey, Illinois, broadcasting Chicago.  And I did the weekend stint.  I was the only person on the air from sunup to sundown.  It was a daylight station.  They'd go off the air at night.  And worked in the summer time, got to be 12 to 16 hour days.  On Saturday they had--the guys who worked during the week would record a show for Saturday and I would play the tape and then do the news breaks in between.  And then I had a live show that ran in the--one in the morning as I recall, one in the afternoon.  On Sunday we did a number of remotes as they are called, from various churches around the Chicago land area.  And I did the booth announces, you might call the announcing for those churches, go to each church and get them on the air.  And then I also had live religious music station, religious music program in the morning and afternoon and anywhere else where they didn't have time that was sold out.  So that was my introduction into broadcasting.
Speaker 1: The question is how did that all come about, though?  I mean just, just--I mean even the desire to go to the school.  Where, where is this interest coming from?
Speaker 2: Well I've always been interested in music, though I'm not a musician.  And I--
Speaker 1: And where did that interest begin?
Speaker 2: I assume it's a natural interest that many people have.  In my case, I had a tape recorder and I used to record music on tape and I get invited to parties, I'd bring that music and my tape recorder and play music for part of the time.  After a while I got to be known a little bit as a person who wanted to dove into things like that.  Then I took this course that I mentioned and got a job at WBEE Radio.  That's how I began in that.
Story_ID: 34106
Speaker 1: So who owned WBEE at the time?
Speaker 2: Rollins Broadcasting.
Speaker 1: Rollins Fergus, and was there an actual man named Rollins?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Rollins Insecticide Company.  This was a--one of his subsidiary type things.  And he was the--that company, the company that owned the station had a representative here, but they--it was an all black station, a rhythm and blues station.
Speaker 1: Now who was on the air black around that time?  You know we're talking about 1955, who were some of the--
Speaker 2: Herb Kent, Lon Dyson, Daddy O'Daily, a guy lived in Morgan Park used to broadcast out of JBD.
Speaker 1: Lucky Cordell?  No, not Lucky Cordell.
Speaker 2: No, Lucky wasn't in there.  He was early on but he wasn't at that point.  I mentioned Daddy O, didn't I?
Speaker 1: Yes, you did.
Speaker 2: There's another guy that was even earlier than he.
Speaker 1: Yes, he--
Speaker 2: I can't remember his name right now.
Speaker 1: Didn't he split his verbs a lot?  I can't remember.
Speaker 2: Very likely.  Most of them did.  Al Benson was one of them.
Speaker 1: Al Benson.
Speaker 2: Al Benson, he's not the one I'm trying to think of, but Al Benson was the one that preceded most of those names that I mentioned.  I can't remember his name right now, but if it comes to me, I'll cough it up.
Speaker 1: Okay, so who, who, who was black over there?
Speaker 2: All of them.
Speaker 1: I mean who, who--
Speaker 2: They were not only black there, we were black everywhere.
Speaker 1: Wait, at WBEE?
Speaker 2: No, that was supposed to be a pun.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: What was your question again, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: Okay, I think--no so what was--so this is owned by Mr. Rollins.  But you're saying it, it was rhythm and blue--did you say it was rhythm and blues?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is--at this point in time, see I wasn't even sure if Herb Kent--now WVON wasn't--Herb Kent was at WVON at this point in time, right?  He went later.
Speaker 2: When I went there, WVON didn't exist.
Speaker 1: That's what I was gonna say, okay.  Yeah, cause I, I--I interviewed him and so you're talking about an earlier time period.  So, so who is--but Herb Kent was at WBEE, right?
Speaker 2: He was at BEE at one point.
Speaker 1: Right, that's where I think he started.
Speaker 2: Herb Kent the Cool Gent.
Story_ID: 34107
Speaker 1: That's right.  So when you--so who is--who's there with you?  I know you're working these weekends, but who else was there?
Speaker 2: Lon Dyson as I mentioned, Larry Woods who went on to New York to broadcast.  Vince Sanders, Bob Weaver was the gospel jock.  Wait a second.  A white guy who used to broadcast from a downtown facility.  And I can't remember his name now, Maury--I can't remember his name, but he broadcast from the downtown facility, didn't come out to the, to--the transmitter and the part of the studios were located out at the transmitter in Harvey, but we had a downtown office on Wacker Drive.  And part of the broadcasting came from there.  I wish I could think of the fellow's name, but he was, he was famous.  I just can't think of it.
Speaker 1: And I think--see I'm thinking cause it's been a long time since I did his interview, but I know that Herb, Herb Kent started there.  So the thing that--and I think he mentioned someone pretty well known too.  But so what is your responsibilities you know, at that point?  You're, you're, you're--is anyone telling you what music to play?  You know are record companies sort of at your doorstep?  Do you--are you responsible for sales?  I'm just trying to understand the life of a broadcaster back then.
Speaker 2: Well at that point you played music from a list that was provided, and the music came off of LP's [long playing] for the most part, or 45's possibly.  You could select what you played within your program, but it all has to come from the playlist.  You are not responsible for trying to sell anybody's record, although there was a lot of stuff going on, payola was--I don't know if it began in that area, era, but it certainly flourished in that era.  We did--not only played the music, we also did live commercials and went off--when you went broadcasting, you might have recorded some commercials for a company.  But that was just as your role as an announcer, not that you had any affiliation with the company or whatever.  And that, that was about it.  Supposedly you had no contact with record companies, not in a manner that would allow them to influence what you played or how often you played it.  And if you--they found out you did, then you would get yourself fired and probably get in trouble with the federal government.
Speaker 1: Well that was--I mean okay but it was commonly accepted back then.  The payola was very strong.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and what, what things were played and how they were played, and the relationships--it was very sort of murky.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Until someone got in trouble.  So, so I--so what were some, what were some of your favorite, favorite artists back then and you know what, what songs remind you of that era?
Speaker 2: One of them was Frank Sinatra, Billy Eckstein, Arthur Prysock, Ellington, Basie and on and on and on.  I was a, a jazz jock principally.  The station started as an R&B and evolved into a jazz station.  Martin Faye, that's another.  See when you get as old as I am, when it comes to your head, you say it then.  Disrupt everything else, say it, then it's your responsibility to remember it.  So I'll ask you next time.
Speaker 1: Marty Faye.
Speaker 2: Marty Faye and there was a personality on the scene in those days whose name was Francis Faye.  I believe she was his, he was--she was his sister.  And I probably shouldn't get into this, but they used to say well Francis Faye was Marty Faye in drag when he wasn't on.  You noticed he never was on the air when she was, etc.  That was a bunch of baloney.  That was the story that went around.
Story_ID: 34108
Speaker 1: Did they look alike?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.  I know--I don't think anyone took that seriously.  It was just one of the things that went around at that time.  You were asking about other, other personalities?  Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne.  Lena by the way, came a few times to Tuskegee while I was there just to entertain the troops and I got a chance to hug her once.  And Nancy Wilson.  A broadcaster that, that I kind of tried to style myself after was Sid McCoy.  We used to have a night time show, late night show.  And, and he was, he was the guy I would like to have been.  And--or we could go on and on till my eighty-seven year old memory ran out.
Speaker 1: But you know that's--cause Sid McCoy was quite a legend.  We weren't able to interview him, but he was quite a legend.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he later went out to the west coast to work with Don Cornelius, who when I was Program Manager at [W]BEE, either there at or [W]MAQ where I was also Program Manager, at one time Don came to seek a job at that point.  And we turned him down.  And he went on to do other things, which turned out to be "Soul Train".  So I credit myself with being partly responsible for his success in that line, even though I don't do that either.  But you also know Chicago character Mary Dee.  In her early days, I claim to be the one who helped to train her, which is only partly true.  For one short period of time she came to the studio out at BEE to learn a little bit about reading commercials, but no I was not responsible for where she is or the talent that she has.  She's since retired and they had a day for her about a month ago at WGN.
Speaker 1: That's right, and she's just written a book too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So she's been very, very instrumental on this project.  She--our first funding came, you know she, she secured for us.  So she's a special person for us.
Speaker 2: Yes, she is special.
Speaker 1: And then you, you know you mentioned Daddy O'Daily because he was also quite a legend at that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I, and I guess I--so can you talk a little bit about him, you know, and his, you know significance?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I met Daddy O, but I didn't know him.  He as you said, was influential at the time.  Daddy O'Daily was the, the man in those days.  I can't remember who else was out there at the same time that he was, but he was very active in the communities as well.  And beyond that, I can't add much.
Speaker 1: Okay, so how would sign off for the evening?  You remember?
Speaker 2: Yeah, everybody seems to have their own little getaway song, you know, that you played.  And my last statement was always was this is Wilk working with you.  And then the music would go down.  I've forgotten what the song was.  I've got a copy of it someplace, but that was my signoff.  But Sid McCoy was Roses on Your Pillow; remember to this day.  And Sid was somethin' else.
Speaker 1: Did you ever have occasion to work with him or to--
Speaker 2: No, I visited with him a few times, but I never worked with him.
Story_ID: 34109
Speaker 1: Okay, so now you, you're at WBEE for eight, is it eight years?
Speaker 2: About eight years or so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then what happened?
Speaker 2: Left there to go to WMAQ.
Speaker 1: But how--so WBEE is AM [amplitude modulation], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and WMAQ was AM also, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Now has FM [frequency modulation] kicked in at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah, WMAQ was owned by NBC [National Broadcasting Company] Radio at the same time they had W--they had an FM station associated with it and located in the same facility.  Can't remember the name at the moment, but when it comes to the surface, I'll spew it out.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So do you remember when WNYR came into existence, or you don't remember?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: That's 1962, okay.  So what about WVON?  When it comes in, does that blow everyone away sort of?  No?
Speaker 2: I don't think it blew everyone away, but I was working at competing stations, so my attitude would be a bit different.  However--
Speaker 1: They were very active in the community.
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.  Leonard Chess and company did their thing.  And they're still active in the community.  They have moved to a new location.  But yeah they did a--Pervis Spann was one of the guys at VON that you--whose name you'd want to remember.
Speaker 1: Pervis Spann the Blues Man.
Speaker 2: The Blues Man, sittin' on a chittlin' bucket in the basement, yeah; remember all that stuff.  Yeah, VON came in and they made a big splash, no two ways about that.  And not only that, one of the reasons--one of the reasons why they beat us is because they're on 24 hours a day and BEE was only on in daylight.  So give them an hourly advantage, plus they had some extremely good talent.
Speaker 1: And each of their people became their own personalities, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 34110
Speaker 1: So, so how did--what was the market that WBEE was making for itself?  Because you said that it was R and B then; you became the jazz, then it went--
Speaker 2: It went jazz after that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Jazz.  Okay, so that then became its--and how long did it stay jazz?  For quite a while, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know.  It was still jazz when I left there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when I went to MAQ.
Speaker 1: And you went to MAQ at what time.
Speaker 2: Radio, I went--must have been in '71 [1971] or two [1972] I think.
Speaker 1: Seventy one [1971] or two [1972], okay.  So when you joined WMAQ, who's in charge of WMAQ Radio?
Speaker 2: I don't remember.  The guy I went there, formerly worked at Rollins Broadcasting, which owned BEE at the time.  And then he moved up and then later he called me and asked if I wanted to work there, and I did.  Lee Davis was his name.  And I went there under him.  He was the Program Director, but there was somebody above him in the--in MAQ Radio.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I can't remember who it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you know I want to go back a little bit.  Cause I just saw here in 1965 that you were the--were you--you were the public relations, WBEE's Public Relations Director?
Speaker 2: Yeah, some of everything, right.  Me and a guy named Zip Johnson.  They gave us both the station wagon they called the BEE Wagon and we did public appearances and promotions of various sorts and so on. But I was the on-the-air jock.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about the "Controversy with Alderman Charles Chew".
Speaker 2: What Controversy?
Speaker 1: No?  A radio show, launches a radio show Controversy.
Speaker 2: The name of the show was Controversy.
Speaker 1: Yes, right, right, right, right, sorry.
Speaker 2: The way you phrased that, I thought you meant some controversy.
Speaker 1: Sorry.
Speaker 2: Not especially.  I remember Charlie Chew.
Story_ID: 34111
Speaker 1: Okay, so when your, when you--so let's talk about Charles Chew cause I've heard of many a story.  I've even seen him--did he have a Rolls Royce or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so can you tell me your own Charles Chew stories.  Cause I've heard countless stories about him.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well Charlie Chew as many know was quite the--an extroverted character.  Character is also descriptive of what Charlie Chew was.  Nice guy I thought, still think.  I remember when he got that Rolls he took me for a ride one time, I was at [W]NAQ at that time.  He said come on man, go ride with me.  And so I did.  Hadn't been in a Rolls, and very seldom since.  And he said this car is so smooth you can put--stand a quarter on the edge on the dash with the engine running, which he did, and it did.  And that's the outstanding thing, thing that I remember about that.  He also owned a summer place over on the other side of the lake.  It was popular with people who had enough dough to do that at the time.  I can't remember the name of the little town.  It was right on the lakefront.
Speaker 1: So it's not Union Pier, or any of those places.
Speaker 2: Union Pier I think it was.
Speaker 1: It was Union Pier, okay.
Speaker 2: Might have been Union Pier.
Speaker 1: Yeah, because a lot of people were--in fact there's a whole history about that, but a lot of people were earning, owning property up there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was starting, it'd turned black.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that probably where it was.  In fact, I'm almost certain that's where it was.  Cause Mary Dee also had property there.  And I was up there, she had a party of some sort and I was invited.  And he--somewhere along the way his house was located--he was sitting on the porch and he saw me pass and said hey Wilk, come here.  And I say that to say that he was that kind of guy.  Even though I had no importance, but he was a, a genunine enough person to site me and say come on over here, you know, have a drink with me.  He was that, that kind of guy.  He wasn't a stand-off person or anything like that, or here I'm a big shot sittin' on my porch in the summer resort and keep on goin', I don't want to be bothered with you; not that.
Speaker 1: Well let's talk about, I mean who he was for those people who wouldn't know who he was.  Because he was--go on.
Speaker 2: Well he was--I, I only knew him as a broadcaster with the "Controversy" program that you spoke of and that's how I met him.  I was not a running mate of his or anything, not in that caliber.  But he and a few other people were nice enough to recognize the underlings as they came along.  Another guy--
Speaker 1: He, he served though, he served as Alderman, but didn't he also serve in the state?
Speaker 2: In the state senate, yeah.
Speaker 1: He served in the state senate, cause he was one of the few sen--senators.
Speaker 2: Senator Charlie Chew, yeah.
Speaker 1: But how did he end up having all that money?  I mean--never mind, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We don't have to discuss that.
Speaker 2: I don't know, but it may be best not to discuss at this point.
Speaker 1: No but I, I've heard--I mean there've been a lot of--you know he was a--now he represented--was it the first ward?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I'm not a Chicagoan, so--
Story_ID: 34112
Speaker 1: You're not, 17th ward, sorry, okay.  So now--so let's go back to--let's go back to 1972.  Well you know what?  I do want to before we--cause I had here about WBEE that there was Bill Kenner.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: There was--well Marty Faye.
Speaker 2: Marty Faye.
Speaker 1: And, and you know he, he was the only white disk jockey there, right?
Speaker 2: Marty Faye, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what was he like?
Speaker 2: He was an extrovert.  He thought he was great and I guess he was.  Yeah, he was kind of a regular guy and he wasn't standoffish or anything like that.  He did a good show.  And that's about all I knew about him.  He broadcast out of the downtown studio on Wacker Drive every day.  And I was on the weekends out at Harvey, at the studio that was located co-located with the transmitter.
Speaker 1: So would you find him hanging in the community at all?
Speaker 2: I doubt it.
Speaker 1: No, okay.
Speaker 2: Certainly if it wasn't in Chicago [Illinois].  As I said, I didn't live in Chicago.
Speaker 1: Not on the South Side, okay.  Huh?
Speaker 2: I did not live in Chicago, I lived in Markham.
Speaker 1: You lived in Markham.
Speaker 2: Or Chicago Heights prior to that, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.  So, so you--so who were you reporting to with all these jobs?  Were you report--who, who did you report to?
Speaker 2: Bill German was the Program Manager at [W]BEE Radio.  John Wilson was the Station Manager at BEE Radio.  I reported to Lee Davis when I moved to MAQ/NBC in Chicago.
Speaker 1: And Lee Davis had been at WBEE.
Speaker 2: Lee Davis had been over me at BEE prior to--that's how I got down there.  He asked me if I wanted to work there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well you know there's a lot of turnover in radio.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so you must have been a very responsible person it sounds like to me.  Cause you had a lot of jobs.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well as I mentioned earlier, they used to call me "Oscar the Square".  My big brag point might be responsibility cause there's a lot of other things I was not--some of which I wish it had been, but that's a whole 'nother story.
Speaker 1: And what does that, what does that--what, what do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Well that, that goes into a whole tangent that--
Speaker 1: Well I'd like to know the tangent a little.
Speaker 2: I bet you would.
Speaker 1: I'm just asking, I'm just asking.  You said Oscar the Square, they called you Oscar the Square.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: They did?
Speaker 2: Yeah, not very hip to anything.  I'm not much better than that now.  Not much better than that now.
Speaker 1: I know, but you were very responsible because you had a lot of positions.  So that meant that people rely on you.  But this other tangent you don't want to go on?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would be--well I guess you would call it spiritual, I don't know.  I can't even figure out what it would be.  But there are a lot of things that in my life and possibly other people too that--other avenues I could have taken and it might have been more interesting than some of the things I have done.  And from what I've seen of some of the people who did take those avenues, it might also have been fatal.  Not that I got any big, dramatic thing that I wanted to do, but in retrospect I, I did what was best for me.  I have no regrets.
Story_ID: 34113
Speaker 1: So when you--so when it's Lee, you said Lee?
Speaker 2: Lee Davis.
Speaker 1: Lee Davis.  So what does he say, how does that come?  What, what happens?  How do you follow him there?  Does he call you up one day, or--
Speaker 2: He was at [W]BEE with Rollins Broadcasting in some managerial capacity above the Station Manager, above the Program Manager.  And I think he was Public Affairs for not only this station, but probably all Rollins across the nation, I'm not sure about that.  However, when he went to [W]MAQ radio, he asked, called and asked me if I would like to work there.  And certainly I would cause there's a network station compared to a local, dinky station.
Speaker 1: I mean it was a big, it's a big station.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how many employees at the time, and--I mean everything is different; benefits.
Speaker 2: At MAQ?
Speaker 1: Everything is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a network station owned by NBC [National Broadcasting Company].  So you know that was the place to be.  When you, when you're in broadcasting and anything as competitive as broadcasting, even to this day, you start small where you can get your foot in the door and every time there's a, an opportunity that's bigger than what yours is if you feel you can handle it, probably if you feel you can't handle it but you want to give it a try, you grab it.
Speaker 1: Well this is what--so what does he say to you?  That's what I'm gonna--he calls you?
Speaker 2: He called me, but I have no idea what he said.
Speaker 1: Okay, but are you--does he call you Wilk?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he says Wilk, got this opportunity, you know come check it out?  Or--
Speaker 2: Probably, I--like I said, I have no idea what he said.
Speaker 1: Okay, so but you--what is the job that you, you were offered there, or you interviewed for there?
Speaker 2: I was Manager of Community Affairs.
Speaker 1: And so who preceded you in that job?
Speaker 2: He's still in broadcasting, he's down at--on the public broadcasting.  I can see his face, but I can't think of his name right now.  I, I can't remember it; if it comes back, I'll--
Story_ID: 34114
Speaker 1: What was your, what were--what did they say they wanted you to do and what did they want you to accomplish?
Speaker 2: Well I was responsible for making sure that we met all the federal requirements for a broadcasting station to stay on.  You don't just come on the air and stay on the air cause you want to, you got to fulfill certain obligations so far as responding to community needs, determining what they are, programming toward response to those needs, and prove that you did.  And the percentage has to be whatever is required at the time, eighteen percent or whatever it was, of programming that responded to those needs.  And my responsibility was to make sure we're doing that; keep record of it so that when it came time to apply for license, you could prove that in paper and you did so, in sheaves of paper.  That was my primary responsibility at that point.
Speaker 1: Well that's a good job for a black person to have at network station.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a good job.
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean a, a very good job.  And so the question I have:  Were they under any heat at that point that they hired you?  Was [W]MAQ--were there any challenges about not doing certain things for the community or not?
Speaker 2: Not--I don't think so, no.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what you then do with the--with your, your, your job then?  What are, what are the programs you put on, and--
Speaker 2: Well we did a number of discussion types of programs, specific ones I can't remember.  And we were involved in the various community activities.  I was like the face for the station at various banquets and stuff.  I ate royally and attended a lot of things I would not have gotten a chance to see on my own.  Went a lot of places that I would not have been able to go to on my own because I was in D.C. [District of Columbia].
Speaker 1: What were some of those places?
Speaker 2: Oh well New York City, the home headquarters, went there a number of times and we were located and still are as far as I know, located in the Rockefeller Center Building there.  Had lunch in the Rainbow Room like the big dogs did and things such as that.  I became the Treasurer for the National Association of Broadcast--
Speaker 1: National Association of Broadcasters?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.
Speaker 1: NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists]?
Speaker 2: NABA [North American Broadcasters Association] I think it was.  Anyway the org--national organization of those who were in my kind of job and across the nation.  And we had a couple of--
Speaker 1: You became what?
Speaker 2: The Treasurer.
Speaker 1: You were the Treasurer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and NBACA [National Broadcast Association for Community Affairs] maybe, National Broadcast Association of--I've forgotten the rest of that title, but it was people who were in, in public affairs at stations across the nation.  And we had several meetings in, in Vail, Colorado and that was nice.  And all kinds of stuff like that, that I would not have been able to do on my own.
Story_ID: 34115
Speaker 1: So who else is having--who's, who's African American or black, is having a similar position to you in Chicago?  Is there anyone at WBBM, or--
Speaker 2: You know a Nobel Award winner Clarence Page?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He was once doing that kind of work at his station and then he went up, you know.
Speaker 1: He went to the "[Chicago] Tribune," right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and he was, he was also a dues man, you know a very capable individual.  And is still on the forefront.  Tryin' to think who else was out there.  I can't remember at this point who else did that kind of thing.  There was, there was a, a lady who I can't remember either.  There were several people doin' that kind of stuff.  It was the popular thing to do in those days cause you had to have some kind of representation and a recognizable black face out there.  And we happen to come along and got put in those positions.
Speaker 1: And the other thing that I was--where, where was WMAQ in the ratings at that point, at the time you were there?  Who was, who was top?  You know, cause you also WGN too in this market.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were a talk radio station for quite a while and one guy, can't remember him, he was a talk jock; kept us in trouble with the Anti Defamation League.  Can't think of his name at the moment.  Somebody manufactured a clock by the same name, a grandfather clock, but he had nothing to do with that.  I can't remember his name.  But he had a talk program ran all morning.
Speaker 1: Was his name Dick, Sweet Dick Burch?
Speaker 2: No, not Dick Burch.  Anyway, the station had a strike at one point and I was--being in the administration part of the thing, I had to run his control board one time, or for a while I should say, not one time.  And I'm tryin' talk as I try to think of his name, but I can't.  Any rate, I remember he used to get into tantrums with people and fly off the handle, which was only--part of it was a part of his show business.  And I was--he was supposed to get into a rage and I was supposed to cut the mic on him.  But I didn't know I was supposed to cut the mic.  His regular engineer knew when to put these things on.  So I sat there and he's rantin' and ravin' and rantin' and ravin' and ranted on and raved on and I'm sitting there watchin' him and he's trying to give me a cue to cut the mic.  And that kind of ticked him off really good.  But--
Speaker 1: So you didn't come back for that, that position.
Speaker 2: But he couldn't do anything about that.  I was a part of the administration, so it didn't, it didn't hurt--he didn't like me much after that I don't think.  What is that man's name?  I can't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Was he real popular?
Speaker 2: Yeah, very popular, very popular.
Speaker 1: Gosh--
Speaker 2: And he stayed in trouble with the Anti-Defamation League cause he's always makin' some remarks and they came up there and I was supposed to answer 'em and I didn't know from nothin' about anything.
Speaker 1: Both of us need help--this is a lot of Chicago--there--I remember, but I don't remember name.
Speaker 2: That guy's name.
Speaker 1: His name.  But he was very--he was always saying things.
Speaker 2: Yeah, very popular.
Speaker 1: But what about, what about--did you have many dealings with DJ [disk jockey] Sweet Dick Burch?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No, not at all, okay.  So let me ask you, cause you were there how many years?
Speaker 2: I remember one thing with Sweet Dick Burch.  I went with the, the guy who brought me there--just--I can't remember his name at the moment.
Speaker 1: Lee, lee.
Speaker 2: Lee Davis to Schenectady I believe it was in New York, when he went up there to listen to his program and then interview him and hired him.  So I was around, I had nothing instrumental to do with his being there, it was just lucky enough to be along.  But I remember Sweet Dick Burch, I never worked with him.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what--I see, okay.  So what was the programming lineup that's--you know because I know the, you know just from what I, I've learned--
Speaker 2: Howard, Howard--
Speaker 1: Howard.
Speaker 2: Howard what?
Speaker 1: Howard--
Speaker 2: Howard.
Speaker 1: Everybody knows.
Speaker 2: Howard.
Speaker 1: Howard.
Speaker 2: Howard Miller, Howard Miller.
Speaker 1: Howard Miller?
Speaker 2: Howard Miller?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: Howard, goodness.
Speaker 2: Anyway, it'll come.
Speaker 1: Is it Miller?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I can't, I can't guarantee it.  Howard something.  I'm thinkin' Howard Miller at the moment, but anyway, that's the guy.  We, we got the same person, we just can't come up with a positive identification.
Speaker 1: I don't think his last name was Howard, I mean Miller, okay.  That sounds--but I--okay.
Story_ID: 34116
Speaker 1: So what I want to understand, if you can sort of--you start in 1972, and you're there for how long?
Speaker 2: At [W]MAQ, eighteen and a half years.
Speaker 1: That's a long time.
Speaker 2: That's a long time in radio broadcasting.
Speaker 1: You--and, and--it's a long time to be in broadcasting, it's a long time to be at, at you know, one station.  So you can tell a lot of the stories about what actually happened, you know during time.  Because--and I would like sir, if you wouldn't mind, not--don't self-deprecate, because that was a significant position to have.  It would be a significant position even today.
Speaker 2: Yeah well, maybe so.
Speaker 1: So can you talk about one, what the difference was, you know, between WBEE and, and there.  And then what your responsibilities were?  Were they the same from the whole, the whole time that you were there, or did they change?
Speaker 2: I think they changed.  I was responsible for that federal--meeting those federal guidelines as I mentioned, for most of the time that I was there and preparing for the license renewals and so on.  But in later years when we changed formats, and we were talk format when Howard Miller or whatever his name was, was there.  And we changed formats from that and went to country music.  We were one of the outstanding country music stations in the country.  And I still had to maintain those records and percentages, etc.  But I also put on country music shows at Landflower [ph.] up in Libertyville annually with top talent from the country music field.  Dolly Parton--she wasn't one of the shows, but she used to come up there cause she wanted to get her records played, so we were one of the, the outstanding record--country music stations in the country and you want to get your stuff played there, so she and Kenny Rogers and--well almost everybody who was big at the time in country music, made it their business to come around WMAQ Radio in Chicago because we were a force.  I'm tryin' to think of the black guy who was--won country music artist of the year two years in a row.  Can't remember his name, but that was an oddity.
Story_ID: 34117
Speaker 1: Is that--not him.
Speaker 2: It's catching.
Speaker 1: You know-- [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: Yes we did. MALE SPEAKER:  Charlie Pride.
Speaker 1: Charlie Pride, right.
Speaker 2: Charlie Pride.
Speaker 1: Hope that didn't blow your ears away.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 1: Charlie Pride, he was country music--number one country music man at country two years in a row.
Speaker 2: So when you went from--you went from what--you went to--from what to, to country?  You went from--
Speaker 1: We were talk at first.
Speaker 2: Talk, so that--
Speaker 1: Then we went to country music.
Speaker 2: So explain how that's done.  Cause a lot of time stations, they don't let anyone know that they're changing.  And they just change.  Is that how--
Speaker 1: No, they, they made a big thing of changing.  Matter of fact, we played country music, same country music song for I think about a half a day or somethin', one right after the other.  You don't do that on the air; don't back up no songs.  But they did that to become conspicuous and let everybody know that we were country music henceforth.  Tryin' to bring the song, but I can't.  It was a song by a person who was famous with the Grand Ole Opry in--at that time in Memphis, Tennessee.  Anyway, no they brought it on very conspicuously.
Speaker 2: And how did you feel?  Because I mean I guess once a radio man, always a radio man.  But did you feel--cause you started out, you know I mean R&B, then jazz is a love of yours.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then you're in talk and then next thing you know, you're in country music.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You've done it all, then.
Speaker 1: I enjoyed it and still enjoy country music.  Yeah it, it's great stuff.  Almost all of its ballads and as the, as the--one of the songs that it's always somebody comin' home on the train in the rain and the dog got runned over, somebody left 'em and that kind of stuff.  But country music is great.  Ray Charles thought so, he made one of his biggest records was a country tune.  I Can't Stop Loving You, country music.
Speaker 2: So what is, in your mind, the difference between country music and blues?
Speaker 1: Subject matter I guess.  It's an analysis that I'm not qualified to make, but to me it's--I think subject matter as, as I mentioned just moments ago, this guy may be singin' about comin' home from Folsom prison on the train in the rain and his dog got runned over.  In the blues the guy's talkin' about the woman that left him.  And you know, the subject matter is different.
Story_ID: 34118
Speaker 1: So what--do you remember also, and this is going back a little bit, but the decision when Lee [Davis] decided that there would--that the station would not carry Chicago White Sox games after the '74 [1974] season?  Do you remember that?  You don't.
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  Pro--I don't know this, but it's probably just economic.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Do you remem--so when, in 1974 though, Lee, Lee--the person who brought you there, leaves, right?
Speaker 2: Somewhere in there, yeah.  I don't remember when it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you get along?  Charlie Warner, Warner takes his place, so tell me how that transitioned?
Speaker 2: Charlie Warner was an entirely different person.  Flamboyant individual and one of his slogans I remember is always do first things first and second things not at all.  And he was in a position to do it and that's just about the way he lived.  And everybody else came to work with collar and tie and suits all the time, and Charlie would show up there with leather pants on and open collar and he did it all the way.  Not only did he do it, when he left there, he went to New York to work in a higher position.  And the last thing he said is what can I leave you to remember me by?  And he gave me, at that time they had Puka beads were popular for men.  And he had a pair he wore, necklace of Puka beads.  Gimme the necklace, and he took it off his neck and gave it to me.  I still got it.  He was a, an outgoing, fabulous character.  And one of the things I remember too about him was that if you did something, even though it was your job and you were supposed to do it, he would always either write you a note or make it a point to get over to you and thank you for doing it.  You were supposed to do that, that's what you're here, hired to do.
Speaker 1: So he was a class act.
Speaker 2: He was a class act.  Crazy class act, but he was a class act.
Speaker 1: So how did the station change under his leadership?  Cause I didn't--so his--he is at the time then the station really goes to country then, right?  Is that under him?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I believe it was.  He had--I was a Program Manager.
Speaker 1: At that point.
Speaker 2: Or a Program Director, I'm not exactly where these, these things fell in.  Bob--Program Director was a fella named, a young guy named Bob--can't remember his last name now but he did research on various music and how many times people heard and how this affects people and all that stuff.  And he was the one that set up the, the playlists for the station and managed the on-air activities and that kind of stuff.  Bob, can't remember his name.  But he later went out, out to the west coast and did the same sort of thing for some bigger west coast station.  I can't remember the--it'll, it'll--I'll blurt it out if it comes up.
Story_ID: 34119
Speaker 1: So you're--so what, what did you--what are you increasingly learning about the radio business during all this time?  What are learning?  I mean--
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing it's very volatile.  If you're a talent on the air, on the radio then and probably now, your days are somewhat limited.  You don't get on there--like I spent eighteen years at that station, but very few if any on air personalities stayed there that long, or anywhere else that long.  You're either good enough to move to somethin' bigger or you weren't good enough to stay where you are, not very stable.  At least it wasn't then and I don't think it is now.  It's not a very stable job.  It's a--constantly in flux and they always got a competitor and a guy try to knock you out of place so he can take your spot.  That's the way the game is.
Speaker 1: So why were you successful there?  You know that?
Speaker 2: Cause I wasn't a talent, I was on the administrative side of it.
Speaker 1: I know but even on that administrative side, what made you good at what you--cause even--each person who comes in can bring in their own team and often do.  They travel from state--
Speaker 2: Yeah, to be brutally honest, I came along at a time when it was advantageous to be black cause these places did not have very many black people, if any.  And they had to get some.  And I remember Jesse Jackson would come through there for interviews on the TV side, and I had met him in, in my endeavors at the other station.  And I knew him, wasn't buddies with him or anything like that, but he knew who I was.  And he'd always make a point when he come through, hi Wilk, you know, and speak to me.  So they didn't know how tight I was and I think that may have been part of the reason why I stayed there as long as I did cause they didn't want to incur the wrath of some guy who was gonna make a lot of noise if they, if they happen to bump somebody who he knew well or something.  I think that had an influence on that, I'm not sure.  Cause I didn't know, don't know Jesse that well.  I know him, but not well.
Speaker 1: So you--so okay, I think that helps.  Now this is also at the time--what you're pointing to, cause a lot of that has gone by the wayside.  I mean I think there's--it's in name, but the community affairs.  I mean what you start with the community affairs and the filings.  When you even talk about the filings, you said it was a lot of paper.  But what, what did the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] really require?  Because they wanted to see that you were giving back to the community.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there was a required percentage of broadcasting that had to be public affairs.  And in order to, to determine what percentages, percentages of broadcasting you had devoted to this, you had to go out and do community action meetings.  Meet with community leaders and see what their perception of what the problems were.  I remember there was a guy at the time, his name was Pierre DeVise.  How I can remember that and can't remember Howard Miller, I don't know.  But his name was Pierre DeVise.  And he was a guy who specializing in population percentages.  And he at that time, this was like, what 60 years ago, 50, whatever, said that this city of Chicago was going to become 50 percent or more Hispanic.  He was dead on, dead on.  And there were others around, but that one I remember well cause at that time everybody said it ain't gonna happen, you know, but it did.  And he also predicted that they were gonna tear down some of the projects as we call them, and make a, a living quarters that these people would not be able to afford.  They're gonna upgrade the whole thing and these people would be out, and that happened.  Pierre DeVise, I remember that very well.  But met him--well I'm not sure I ever really met him.  I knew about him because of this, these community action meetings that we'd have, had to have, and we had one every month and sometimes we'd specialize, we'd do it.  Sometimes with the religious community, with various leaders.  I'm tryin' to think of some of the people who were popular then.  Guys the likes of which Father Pfleger is now.  Although Pfleger was not this prominent then if, if he was around at that time.  There was a black pastor--
Speaker 1: You mean--are you talkin' about the ministers, so it would be Reverend--well there was--
Speaker 2: Reverend Daniel was one of them.
Speaker 1: How bout Lucius Hall or--
Speaker 2: Lucius Hall was just a singer.
Speaker 1: He was just sing, okay.
Speaker 2: At that time.  He may have become a--
Speaker 1: Right, he did become a minister.
Speaker 2: --a minister later, yeah.  Lucius Hall used to be--
Speaker 1: What about Fellowship Baptist Church?  Reverend--
Speaker 2: He just retired a few years ago.  In fact he was in the news recently.  He's also a singer.
Speaker 1: Right, I heard he was--he had a--sorry.
Speaker 2: That I didn't know.
Story_ID: 34120
Speaker 1: (Indistinct conversation)
Speaker 2: Now your, now your comedian side is comin' out, okay.  So, now, it was Father, it's Father George Clements.
Speaker 1: Exactly, that's the cat. [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 2: Okay, and so you were talkin' bout Clay, Reverend Clay Evans, Father George Clements.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: The, you know Jim Compton was big.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was the Urban League.  What was the guy who preceded him?
Speaker 2: That was Bill Barry.
Speaker 1: Bill Barry, I knew Bill fairly well.  Yeah, he was an interesting character, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So can you describe, can you--did you know him fairly well?  So can you give some stories about him?
Speaker 1: I didn't know him that well, no.
Speaker 2: Cause see, people say he was really quite, quite a class act.
Speaker 1: That--my impression of him was class, yes.  But I didn't know him, you know.  A lot of these people in the job that I had, you'd get to know them because you ran into them at these various functions and affairs.  And some of them I even remember who you were, at least your face.  But when I say yeah, I know him, I don't mean that I was a running buddy or in his caliber or anything like that.
Speaker 2: But really--and you're talking about radio in its heyday, and during that time period.  You know which is even though, you know in what I'm reading, you know, WMAQ was sort of going up and down in terms of ratings, but it's still radio in its heyday when you look at the media of today.  You know not that radio has gone away, but it's a much different kind of animal out here.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So when you sort of think about back, would you still--you do consider yourself a radio guy, right?
Speaker 1: I have been, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so can you talk about the organization that you worked with as the, a treasurer.  It was NAS, NA, not NABA--
Speaker 1: National Association of Broadcast--I can't--the last two words had to do with broadcast public affairs.  National Association of Broadcast--
Speaker 2: PA?
Speaker 1: NBACA, no it was NBACA, N, NBACA [National Broadcast Association for Community Affairs]
Speaker 2: Okay, NABAC--
Speaker 1: N, NBAC, National Asso--NA--National Association of Broadcast something, community affairs maybe.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, community affairs.
Speaker 2: Community affairs, okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Broadcast Community Affairs.  Yeah, I guess that was it, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay so tell, tell us about that organization.
Speaker 1: It was made up of people who were in my position from radio stations across the country.  And there are--then, even then and are now thousands of such stations.
Speaker 2: When was it founded and--
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So who was president when you were--you remember who was president when you were treasurer or anything?
Speaker 1: No, I don't remember any of that stuff.
Speaker 2: Okay.  How many, how many blacks were involved in that organization?
Speaker 1: Not very many.  Not even ten percent of it but I can't give you any figures.
Speaker 2: Would you ever participate in the National Association of Black Journalists conference at all?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No?  Okay.
Speaker 1: No, I was not in journalism.
Speaker 2: Okay, so all your things were really--well I won't say all of them, they were primarily local, but you were involved in the national organization.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And then you would go from time to time to New York and things like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 34121
Speaker 1: I want, I want to ask what of the times were times that you know, stick out in your mind?  Can you tell during your eighteen year career, either very positive like a--you know, several positive stories and something that was a low point.
Speaker 2: Perhaps the most positive story pops into my mind is the fact that I was at the first march to Washington [D.C.].  I was on the steps when Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] gave his speech.  I was at [W]BEE radio then and BEE being a local station, small, didn't have the money to send people there.  So I went there on my own.  And I had the station as, as my credentials, so I got to be a part of the press corps, and that's how I got to be on the steps of the monument and this million people or whatever that number was that lined the reflecting pool, the mall were all back there.  And I heard the speech.  I could almost hear his voice without the speakers, I was so close.  And also got to be near him in the press tent, which was off to the side and behind all of that prior to his being up there.  So yes, that was an outstanding event in my life that I'll always remember.
Speaker 1: Not many people could say that they were that close.
Speaker 2: No, there were a lot of people were there, but not up, not up, not right up there.
Speaker 1: Not up close like that.
Speaker 2: And I wouldn't have been there had it not been for the affiliation with BEE radio.
Speaker 1: So what was the significance you think?  And I especially--cause there's a lot of discussion now of this being the anniversary.  So I'd like to maybe ask a reflective comment, you know because you were there and you know, could be your fate or you know what--was the dream realized?  You know--
Speaker 2: Not totally, but has come a long way.  We've got a, a long way yet to go I fear.  But that was very inspirational.  It gave you something to hope for.  Gave you a leader to follow that you could believe in.  Who wasn't there and obviously to me at least, was not there for self grandizement [ph.].  He was there doing what he felt needed to be done and tryin' to attract some attention to it so the rest of the nation could get in line and start living we supposed to live.  It was very inspiring and as I said, I'll never forget being there.
Speaker 1: So there is anything if you hear or see it, remind you of that day?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You know, cause that day--I've often heard that or in the work that we do that Mahalia Jackson who was there that day, suppose--the rumor says that she sort of leaned over and said Martin, remember that speech you gave in Detroit [Michigan].  Now whether that is true or not, you know, you don't know.
Speaker 2: I don't know either.  That wasn't the first time he used "I Have A Dream".
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 2: Not the first time.  But that was the most effective time he used it.  I knew Mahalia, by the way, another bright point.  She I knew a little bit better cause I went to her house a few times.  A friend of mine used to sing with her, the backup group when she sang.  And she also--I saw in her archives you did a thing on Judge Strayhorn.  And at the time she and Strayhorn lived about a block apart there on the south side.  But Mahalia might very well have leaned over and told anybody anything.  Mahalia was out there.
Speaker 1: So what--how would you describe her, though?
Speaker 2: Mahalia?  I'd say she was a very outgoing person.  A real person.  She used to always brag about I've got my own--I answer my own telephone when you call my number, and that was true, she did.  However, the underlying thing was that her phone had five lines on it, or four lines I guess.  You know multiple phones like they had in offices.  And there's one line that was personal and nobody knew that except her very personal friends.  And then these other three lines and if she felt like answering, she would answer.  But if anyone rang on that one line, it was--naturally she's gonna answer that first, which doesn't detract from over I'm not tellin' something that's out of school.  It's just that yes she did answer her own phone, but she didn't always answer every call that came through.
Speaker 1: And she--there hasn't been another Mahalia Jackson.
Speaker 2: No, probably never will be.
Speaker 1: Now what--where was she living then at the time that you were going over?
Speaker 2: Think it was 83rd I believe, or in that area, a block or two east of King Drive, of highway, expressway.  And then later on she moved over closer to the coast and I didn't know where she lived at that time, one of those towering buildings over there.
Story_ID: 34122
Speaker 1: So what other organizations were you a part of?  You know, were there any other business organizations or community affairs organizations, the Boule [ph.], the 40, what is it, the Original Forty Club?
Speaker 2: No, none those--more local thing, smaller groups.  I was president at one time of the Gavin Foundation, which is out south, named after Charles E. Gavin, a doctor out there.  I was president of the Harvey Rotary Club at one point.  I don't know, I'm--perhaps a small number of smaller organizations, but nothing big like you have reference to.
Speaker 1: And so when it came time--cause you, you, you retired when you were 62.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and why did you--was it retirement age then, or did you retire three years earlier than you should?
Speaker 2: They sold the station, WMEQ sold its station to some news entity that was buying stations across the country.  And they turned the station into a all news station at that time and they offered me a nice severance package.  They offered me a chance to stay on that station, but I don't have a journalistic background; I knew that was only a matter of time.  So I grabbed the package that they offered and came home.
Speaker 1: And then what did you do?  What have you been doing all this--
Speaker 2: As the old folks used to say, "I ain't hit a lick of the rattlesnake".  I did what I wanted to do after that.
Speaker 1: So what was that?
Speaker 2: I bought an airplane with a friend of mine, a Dr. Ellison, and we flew for a while and then sold the plane after about thirteen years cause we weren't using it enough to warrant keeping it.
Speaker 1: So you actually--you bought your won plane.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay and so would you do pleasure flying or just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, all pleasure, all pleasure and after a while that got to be a task and we weren't using it enough to maintain it properly, so we sold it.  I've been active in my church.
Speaker 1: That, that had been a dream, though.  I don't mean to cut you off, but that, that must have been a dream.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To have your plane.  I mean cause remember you didn't really fly--I mean you didn't get a chance to fly in combat, you flew every day, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well I didn't get a chance to fly in combat, not that I don't want to sound heroic.  I wasn't looking to go--I didn't get in the Air Force to go fly in combat.  Although I was there to do so, I would willingly have gone so, gone to do so.  But the fact that I didn't fly and shoot people down or get shot down, is not a disappointment.  It was a disappointment to come back to the society that I had left and found that I couldn't get a job because of the color of my skin even though I had the training.  That was a disappointment.  By the time that avenue had opened up, I was too old to meet the qualifications.  So that opportunity was never there.  However as you mentioned, I did get a chance with my partner, Dr. Ellison, to buy a 172, that's a high wing Cessna aircraft, carries four people when you're lucky enough to keep it in the air.  And we had a good time with that.  We both got our instrument ratings and commercial license, etc.  And you know that was, that was an era and a phase that we lived and enjoyed and had moved on from.
Speaker 1: So where did you--where would you fly?  What kinds of trips were you taking?
Speaker 2: Lots of times just flying to be flying.  We used to go buy the $45 hamburger.  In those days $45 was an awful lot of money, but what the deal was that in order to have someplace to go, you'd go to an airport that had a nearby restaurant like up in Wisconsin someplace.  And you'd land there and you'd go to eat, eat whatever and then you'd get back in the plane and fly back home, just to have someplace to go.  We'd fly to--Playboy had a place up in Lake Geneva with an airstrip and we'd go up there occasionally.  He had a daughter who was in music school in--near Cleveland I think it was, Ohio.  We flew there once or twice and went to visit relatives in Dayton.  Stuff like that.  Mostly, most of the time you go to these places to have someplace to go to more than actually needing to go there in an airplane.  But it was fun.  Not as much fun as flying in the military like you can't do spins and aerobatics in the 172 like you could in the Stearman that I mentioned earlier.
Story_ID: 34123
Speaker 1: So you see today--cause you've been in recent times, more accidents in the, you know in the, the small, private planes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Probably has a lot to do with the fact that there are more of them out there and I don't know--people--it's a different era I guess.  But I don't know why there would be more, other than the fact that there's more people flying.
Speaker 1: The other thing--did you ever come--what about Jim Tillman?  Did you ever see--cause he also was a pilot.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he used to fly for--
Speaker 1: American.
Speaker 2: I think it was American, but he used to fly for one of the majors, yes, and he used to work at MAQ TV at the time that I was there.  And I mentioned that Jesse [Jackson] would come through and he'd wave and speak to me and let everybody around know, hey he must know somebody.  So I used to also conduct tours for various people when they come to facility when I was co-located at the Merchandise Mart on the 18th floor.  And I'd take a tour through the radio area and then I'd take them over on the TV side even though I was not affiliated with the TV.  And we'd cut through the studios and all that.  And if it happened to be that, that Jim was there, he'd always make it a point hey, Wilk, you know.  We were not buddies or anything, but the fact that he would wave to me or recognize that I was there boosted me up and these people following me down the halls would think that I was somebody.  And I also know--I would take them down--there was one of these medical shows on TV at that time, "General Hospital" or somethin' like that.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And they had one long hall--
Speaker 1: But that's a soap opera.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.  And I'd take them down one of these long halls going between the AM and the, and the TV station.  And I'd say have you--any of you watched "General Hospital"?  And they'd say yeah.  I'd say well this is the hall that we shot in, and lying--but I'd straighten them out at the end.  But those were fun days and Jim Tillman was a, a really nice guy.  His son got to be a pilot also.  I think he flies with the airlines even now.
Speaker 1: Cause, cause Mr.--he lives in, in Phoenix now, Scottsdale, Phoenix.
Speaker 2: Jim Tillman does?  I never knew what happened to him, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, so let me ask you--see this part I wasn't here.  So you're originally from where?
Speaker 2: Chicago Heights [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Chicago Heights, okay.
Speaker 2: Born and bred.
Speaker 1: So you separate yourself.  Why is there separation from Chicago?  I mean even though it, it's a different area, so--
Speaker 2: Well it's just a fact.  You know, Chicago Heights is twenty-five miles south of here, entirely a different culture.  At least it was then.  What's left of Chicago Heights is entirely different from what it was then, too for that matter.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, Chicago Heights has become a lot of vacant land in the part of town that I lived in, in Chicago Heights, in the east side of town where blacks lived in those days.  And now most of those places are even old then that have been torn down.  Some new ones are built there, but they're not fancy places at all and they're in wasteland.  Perhaps wasteland is too brutal.  In land that's vacant around there that had had, had buildings on them and been torn down and not yet replaced.  So in order to do anything, if you want to get into a whole lot of activity and carrying on, you have to come into Chicago.  And if you're driving to Chicago, you have to tack $30 on to anything you're going to do, to park.  I was invited to a cruise which for me was free cause I was representing the Tuskegee Airmen on the cruise and other people.  And in order to participate in this thing, I had to park in the nearby parking lot.  When I came back, the bill for parking was $30.  And it's similar wherever you go, if you go to dinner someplace downtown in Chicago, your dinner might cost $50, $60, and your parking is gonna cost you at least 20 bucks.  So those of us who live out and used to parking for free or maybe a small fee at a, you know at the curb or somethin', that kind of money gets to be--or maybe I'm just stingy, but I change my mind about where I'm gonna eat if I'm gonna eat downtown or you know, a mall or some local place.  So most of my activities take place in the suburbs nowadays.
Story_ID: 34124
Speaker 1: So you've lived a respectful, respectful life.  When you look at--but you've been in the black community involved, you know and, and radio, music and talk.  Well mainly radio music, for--that was like--
Speaker 2: In the black community?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean that was like 30-something--
Speaker 2: Eighty something years.
Speaker 1: No, but 30-something years.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: But in the black community when you look at where the black community is, and what are your hopes and concerns for that community?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I guess I haven't given that part of it too much thought.  I hope that someday things will be such that the color of one's skin will not determine the content of your character, to paraphrase Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.].  But we've got a long way to go.  We've come a long way and we have to recognize the fact that we have.  I don't have children, so I--those aspirations I don't think about too often cause I don't have to worry about where my underling is gonna go or how he's gonna fair, he or she.  I hope things get better.  Crime is running rampant everywhere you go.  And it's really running rampant in Chicago [Illinois] and the suburbs.  We need to do something about that.  It's kind of rough to criticize something and you don't have a solution for it.  You know if you're gonna talk about something, then you should have somethin' to say about how you're gonna eliminate it, then I don't have.  I come up with somethin', I'll come back and bring it to you guys and maybe we can get somethin' goin'.
Speaker 1: Okay, well what about not how to eliminate it, but if you look back, do you know what caused it?
Speaker 2: What caused--
Speaker 1: What caused the disintegration of community?  You said, you know, you talked about the change.  Let's put it the change--that's too strong.  Change in the community.
Speaker 2: Well I guess a number of things.  Desegregation so far as, what do they call it when segregation is documented as opposed to--there are two terms.  One when it's defined, and one when it just happens.  And I can't remember the terminology.  But when we get past those stages and can move on to judging each person by what that person is able to do or willing to do to accept the other person's viewpoint and go on from there, then everything will be better.
Speaker 1: So that's a hopeful statement.
Speaker 2: Very hopeful, and we still have hope.  Keep hope alive.  Who said that?  Jesse [Jackson].
Speaker 1: Jackson, that's right.
Story_ID: 34125
Speaker 1: So, so what do you want your legacy to be, sir?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  That's one of the reasons why--I'm not much of a joiner.  And when I got out of the service, a few years after I got out of the service, the Chicago Chapter, Dodo Chapter as we call ourselves, of the Tuskegee Airmen, formed.  And I didn't join it cause I mentioned I'm not much of a joiner.  However in later years when I found out that I'm by myself in essence; I have relatives around the country and some herein Chicago and we're all associated and all that, but I don't have any immediate family.  I said well when I kick, all they're gonna do is run a bulldozer through here and they won't know I was here.  I said maybe I better go over there and put some kind of seed down so that they'll know where to find me.  And I went three or four years ago and joined the Chicago Dodo Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen.  And since then I've been running like crazy tryin' to keep up with the things that they're doing to perpetuate the airmen.  And getting some of that stuff rubbed off on me, like my interview here today.  If I had not been a part of the Tuskegee Airmen, you or anybody else would not have known I was around.  So I would like to be remembered that I was tryin' to be a nice guy.  Tried to carry my weight in the community and I was just Wilk.
Speaker 1: And thank you Wilk, thank you Mr. Wilkerson.  That's all I can say is thank you.  Okay we're done.  Thank you.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Story_ID: 34126
Speaker 1: My gosh--
Speaker 2: So if--and, and when I go back and, and delve further, I've looked, but I don't come up with anything--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: If I find it, I'll send it or bring it. [OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION]
Speaker 1: Okay, on my left pocket you'll see the top thing is my wings.  Pilot's wings from United States Army Air Force as it was known in the days that I got mine.  It since became just the United States Air Force.  Those are pilot wings.  Below that is the emblem for the Chicago Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen.  We call ourselves the Dodo Chapter.  The dodo as you probably know is a bird that became extinct because it lost its ability to fly.  And that's why they adopted the slogan.  Guys came back from the service, they lost their ability to fly cause they couldn't fly commercially, and then became extinct.  The Chicago Chapter and all of the Tuskegee Airmen chapters are dedicated to perpetuating the legend of the Tuskegee Airmen, those guys who fought nobly with the 99th and the 332nd overseas in Italy and North Africa.  Lost their lives, became imprisoned, but made it back here and came back to the same thing that they left.  And these people who are part of this chapter, some of them are--some very few of them are documented original Tuskegee Airmen.  We lost, in the past seven months we've lost six of our chapter members who met that qualification, including the president emeritus, who was just buried a couple weeks ago.  And the chapter is dedicated to not only perpetuating the legend, but also encouraging minority youth and all youth to pursue careers in aviation, associated with aviation.  So that's what that badge stands for.
Speaker 2: What are the three--I see a red tail in the middle.  What is the three planes?
Speaker 1: The logo?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The nearest one is a B25, my aircraft.  The next one if I remember it would be the, the Red Tail P51.  The one behind that should be a P40, which is the, the first aircraft they flew, or among the first.  They also flew a P39.  The other emblems you see on my lapel are buttons that were given to us from various places that we have made a presentation at or that honored us for one reason or another.
Speaker 2: Okay, and then what about the--I guess the--we see the emblem on the hat as well.
Speaker 1: That, I thought that's what you were looking at.
Speaker 2: We were looking at breast pocket.
Speaker 1: I think he went, he went--what he did is he went I think--
Speaker 2: I call myself goin' from the top down from memory.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then he went, he went, huh?
Speaker 2: Said I, I thought I was doing from memory top down, and then you asked about what those planes were and I thought you meant the ones up here.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I think it's the same one.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Could you tell me what's that to your right?  We can see it now--there's another emblem on the other side of your, on the side of your hat.
Speaker 1: I have no idea what that is.  Let me look; I just don't remember.  I may not know when I look.
Speaker 2: Just take it off and look.
Speaker 1: Spitfire, Spitfire was a English group to my knowledge.  And that's the Air Force emblem on that side.
Speaker 2: Then turn the other side to us so we can see the Spitfire; no, the other side, Spitfire side.
Speaker 1: The Spitfire.
Speaker 2: Great, okay.
Speaker 1: That was an aircraft in World War II, same as from the English called the Super Marine Spitfire, and apparently there was also a group by that name.
Story_ID: 34127
Speaker 1: How do you feel when you're in a plane?
Speaker 2: Wonderful.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?  No, you, you can't feel--okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a, it's an entirely different feeling, particularly if you're, if you're in command of that aircraft.  If you're flying it, you have virtually wings.  If it's the kind of aircraft that you can do whatever you want to do in, you know like, like the Stearman that I mentioned earlier.  The trainer with the two wings.  The plane can do just about anything.  You can spin it, go out of control, and then back.  Or you can stall or you can fly straight and level or do steep turns.  Or whatever--you just do all kinds of things in it.  And there are a number of planes like that, that you can maneuver and let your maneuvers express how you happen to feel at the moment.  I can imagine--I never flew a jet, but one of my ambitions was to at least get a ride in an F16, that's the same plane that you see the Thunderbirds are famous--flight team fly.  And that can do just about anything.  It's a relatively small aircraft compared to those jet fighters, but it's highly maneuverable and I would just imagine just hauling off in that thing and doing some slow rolls and some big rolls and all kinds of stuff.  I remember one time going to Oshkosh.  By the way I didn't mention, I got a flight in the cockpit of the Constellation when it was still flying.  It was goin' as a courier to London, escorting some bags of checks I guess there were, I don't even know what was in it.  And they did it on the Concord and I went to the John, which was up near the front of the plane.  And as I came out, there was a--the door of the cabin out over the ocean was open, and I stopped to look and the pilot said you want to sit down?  And he let me sit down and we talked briefly.  Turns out he flew a 172 like I did.  When he got home after flying this--one of the fastest commercial planes--the fastest commercial plane that ever was, he gets home, he flies this 172 for pleasure.  And he let me sit there and watch him fly and that was a thrill.  I don't know how I got into that, but--
Speaker 1: I was asking how, how it felt to fly.
Speaker 2: How it felt to fly?  Yeah, that too was a, was an exuberant situation.  But it, it feels wonderful.  It releases you from the ground after you get out of the controlled areas.  There are controlled areas in the air where you have to pay attention to what's going on, like you flying in the Chicago [Illinois] area up close, you have to know where you are at all times and be cleared through by the people--either the tower or the flight control area that you're in.  And you can't be foolin' around there.  But once you get away from the metropolitan area, then you get up some altitude, you can do just about anything you're capable of doing.  And depends on how free your spirit is and what your skills and limitations of aircraft are.  It's wonderful.
Story_ID: 34128
Speaker 1: It sounds like you like to take advantage of those free spaces when you got up there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I remember one time, probably shouldn't have told this, but after graduation, one of the things the guys used to do--somebody would get a flight to Chicago for instance, and he'd get in--he landed at what is now O'Hare [Airport].  It was a--some kind of manufacturer's field at that time.  They would land there and then they'd get out and they'd crack the exhaust on one of the engines and you can't fly with a cracked exhaust, so they'd call back to Tuskegee and tell 'em I got a cracked exhaust.  You have to send me an exhaust cause they don't have any parts for B25.  So they'd send another B25 up with the parts they needed and the mechanic to put 'em on.  And that got two crews a chance to fly to Chicago [Illinois].  And all that wasn't supposed to happen.  And I would--had a chance to do that one time; flying to, to bring the part.  And going from Tuskegee [Alabama] to Chicago almost in line to that airport is my home, Chicago Heights [Illinois].  So I couldn't resist the temptation.  I had to buzz Chicago Heights, my hometown.  So I came down and if you're gone do a proper buzz jaw, job, you have to make two passes.  First pass you come along and you had a low altitude, but not as low as you're gonna get cause you gotta wake 'em up and let 'em know you were there.  So you fly past and it rattles their windows and all that, and the people say what was that?  And they'd run out.  And by that time you make your bank turn and you come back again and they're out on the street lookin', what was all that about?  And you come back the next time and you're down there as low as you dare get and whiz through there and then you run like crazy cause the--anybody got your tail number.  Every aircraft has a specific number like license plates on your car.  They got your tail number, or even if they reported somebody being there, there aren't enough planes to, to get into the crowd.  Well if they had found out I had did that, I would not be around today.  They would have--well they would've yanked my license at the least.  But it didn't happen; nobody reported me.  In fact, when I got back, I was a small time hero.  But that, that's one of the, the things that I did that I shouldn't have done.  But in retrospect I'm glad I did.
Speaker 1: Thank you sir, thank you.  Thank you for coming out.
Speaker 2: The pleasure's mine.  Thank you for having me.
