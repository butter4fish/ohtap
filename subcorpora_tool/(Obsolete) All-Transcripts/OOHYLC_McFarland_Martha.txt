 Finchum Today is May 6, 2015. My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Alex  Bishop, and we   re with Oklahoma State University. Today we   re in  Quapaw, Oklahoma, to speak with Martha McFarland. Thank you for  having us today. This is part of our Oklahoma 100 Year Life. We   ll  start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  McFarland I was born March 20, 1915 in Ottawa County in the Shawnee Lake  District, on Highway 10, east of Miami. I have lived in Ottawa County  all my life. I   m still a resident of Ottawa County.  Finchum Were your parents from here?  McFarland No. My father was from around Duenweg, Missouri, and my mother  from Joplin, Missouri.  Finchum What brought them here?  McFarland My father bought a farm on the east of Highway 10, and he and my  mother moved here after they were married on December 25, 1911.  They were married on Christmas Day.  Finchum How did they meet?  McFarland My mother had graduated from high school and was teaching in a rural  country school out of what they called Atlas, Missouri, which was east  of Duenweg. You could teach school right out of high school then. My  father was a farmer there in that district and that   s how they met. She  had a brother that lived there, and I suspect that   s how they met,  through the brother or maybe through some of the school people. The  schoolteachers boarded with the families so many weeks or so during  their teaching year, and she may have met him during that period.  5  Finchum Did she have to quit when she got married?  McFarland No, but they moved from east of Duenweg to  Oklahoma . She never  lived there. He had the place ready for her to move into down here on  Highway 10. He had already bought it, or was borrowing to buy it.  Finchum What did he farm?  McFarland Well he raised corn, and wheat, and oats. Cattle was not an issue then.  People in the country didn   t raise beef cattle like they do now. So any in  the cattle line would   ve been the milking breed, and then sold the milk  from that. Beef was not a problem then, they didn   t raise beef. We  didn   t have beef on our farm ever in the time we lived there.  Finchum What kind of meat would you eat? Chicken?  McFarland We ate chicken, and we had lamb, and we had squirrel, and rabbit,  mallards, and geese  and pork .  Bishop You didn   t have possum?  McFarland No, I   ve eaten possum. It   s not bad when you   re cooking it with sweet  potatoes in the oven.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  McFarland I had one brother,  Allen . He was ninety-four years old when he died.  He had been a school superintendent and he resigned from it and went  to California. He did not like the issue of being on the fence, one  pulling this way, and one pulling that way. He said there had to be a  better way of making a living and being happier with it. He had a  master   s degree in science. Then I had a sister that was two years  younger than he, and she lived to be eighty-four I believe. Then I had a  younger sister and she died when she was twenty-three. She died real  young, she had what at that time they called acute encephalitis. Now it  appears that kind of a paralyzing disease. Her lungs were paralyzed and  she died in Walter Reed Hospital. Her husband was a marine.  Then we had our dogs and cats, and I had every crippled chicken or bird  that ever came by. I had just about every kind of house plant you could  find at that time. Now my room is loaded with flowers.  Finchum Would you have to help around the farm?  6  McFarland I   ve hoed many a row of grain. I have a scar where I was hit with a hoe  by one of the other kids that got over anxious. You walked and you  pulled the weeds or you chopped them with a hoe.  Finchum Barefooted or with shoes?  McFarland Barefooted most of the time. Usually you had about two pairs of shoes  during the year. One was to wear to school and all, and one was for  church and there. When your school shoes were worn, then you took  your others. Then you got two new pair and the same routine.  Finchum Did your mother make your clothes?  McFarland My mother was not a very good seamstress, but you didn   t have too  many clothes. I remember when my brother was in high school, and that  was getting on up in the century, he had one pair of overalls to wear to  school. He was in high school, but they washed them in the middle of  the week and my sister got up and ironed them for him. Times were  hard then. I had one dress when I was in the seventh grade, had no coat,  and we washed the dress during the middle of the week, and then you  ironed it too. Now you just take it out of the tub and dry it and put it on.  I didn   t have a coat, but when I was in the eighth grade my teacher,  Mrs. Phillips, gave me a sweater. Then when I was in the ninth grade in  school, my uncle   s aunt had an extra coat so I had another coat, but  times were hard then.  Finchum That would   ve been in the    30s?  McFarland Been in    29, and    30s.  Finchum During the Depression time?  McFarland That   s right.  Finchum Do you have any other memories from that time period?  McFarland Do I have other memories?  Finchum From the Depression?  McFarland Oh yes, I remember that we had two milk cows. One was always being  milked while the other one was waiting for the birth of a calf or  something. We sold milk to a customer and he didn   t have the money to  pay, and he was a preacher and had several children, and my father gave  him milk, part of that milk for a long, long time to help with his  children. Now that was my father, that was his method.  7  Finchum What was his name?  McFarland Thad.  Finchum Thad?  McFarland T-H-A-D Sovieskie. That   s, I think, a Russian name.  Finchum Can you spell that?  McFarland S-O-V-I-E-S-K-I-E, I think is the way you spell it, but it   s a Russian  name, and the family had a friend that they doted on, so they named  him after their friend. But he was called Thad.  Finchum What was his last name?  McFarland Snyder. S-N-Y-D-E-R, and that is German or Dutch.  Finchum What were Christmases like when you were a little girl?  McFarland We always got something, I don   t   it wasn   t always something   It was  something we needed always or we could use. I remember for birthdays  my mother would save the piece of glassware that was in the oatmeal  thing. Like a cup or a cereal bowl or something, and she   d put it up and  that   d be our birthday present, because all families used the oatmeal. I  still like it, it   s a good cereal. (Laughs)  Finchum How would she do her laundry?  McFarland You had a great big old tub that had a number on how big they were,  and you had a washing board like this (gestures) with ripples in it. You  had a big, copper, oval-shaped thing you put on the fire outside. You  wash your white clothes on that board and you throw them in that vat,  or whatever, with your lye soap. You boiled them and then you took  them back out and you washed them again. By the way, when I was  eleven years old that was my duty was to help do the washing. I helped  on that board from the time I was eleven years old on up.  Finchum So you scrubbed it     McFarland You scrubbed them like this, and turned them over and you scrubbed  them on the other side. Now don   t misunderstand me, you didn   t have  too many clothes. (Laughter) You had enough clothes to wear, but     Finchum Sure.  8  McFarland Yes, but you didn   t have many.  Finchum Would you do them outside in the winter too?  McFarland No. You did them in the house, but you went outside and took the  clothes. You boiled them on the stove, a big old woodstove, when it  was cold.  Finchum Describe the house that you grew up in.  McFarland The house I grew up in was T-shaped. Had two long rooms on the top  side, and then the leg on the T, it had two little rooms there. The first  one was the kitchen and the dining room, and the other was usually a  sitting room with two or three, maybe with just a bed or so in there for  little kids. Then the other room was the big, long, two rooms and that  was your bedrooms.  Finchum Had to share with your sister?  McFarland And your brothers.  Finchum Oh, all of them. Okay.  McFarland Your brother   I had the one brother.  Finchum Did your mother quilt?  McFarland My mother did not quilt any until that I know about, until she was in her  seventies. She learned how to embroidery at the same time, but now she  was a quilting fiend, piecing quilts, and I was too. I pieced quilts seems  like all my life. I had just several   I gave away lots of them, and I also  gave some for, you know, when you   d raffle them off or something in  an organization. I loved to piece quilts. I   d piece them now, here, if I  could see and if my fingers would work, because I love piecing quilts.  Finchum If she didn   t quilt, what would you use for cover?  McFarland You usually took two pieces of flannel or something and put this cotton  between it, and you took yarn and a darning needle and stuck it through  it, tied it, and it was a knot that held it together.  Finchum What they call tacking?  McFarland Yes, I guess you would call it that.  9  Finchum Where did you go to elementary school?  McFarland I went through the fourth grade at District Number 5 on Highway 10,  about twelve miles east of Miami.  Finchum How many kids were in     McFarland I don   t remember that part. Part of them was big as adults, big as the  teacher.  Finchum Was it a one-room?  McFarland Yes ma   am. It was one room and outdoor bathroom facilities,  woodstove in the wintertime. No lunches, you carried your lunch in a     we did, in a little half a gallon tin syrup bucket with a lid on it. We  carried it to school, and we lived a mile and a quarter from the school  where we went. If the weather was really bad, my dad put us on two  horses and we went to school, and he took the bridles off and the horses  came home, and then my dad would come back after us.  Incidentally my sister who   s older than I, she never missed a day, or  was never tardy, in her entire school life. That   s on her record here  someplace in Quapaw. She graduated from Quapaw and I did too, and I  graduated in 1933.  Finchum What was in your little bucket for lunch?  McFarland You had   well they made their own white bread. Their own white  bread and all. You had a sandwich with maybe a big slice of ham on  it   you cured yourself. And you always had fruit, and we had an  orchard, always had fruit in it. That was about all you needed,  sandwiches and fruit.  Finchum Would your mother can much?  McFarland Yes, but it was a different kind of canning than this canning nowadays.  We didn   t have tin cans then, so you used glass jars. There was the  brand Mason. You just wouldn   t can if you didn   t have Mason fruit jars,  because they were supposed to be about the best.  Finchum Where would she get her jars?  McFarland You could buy them at the stores where they had everything for sale.  Finchum What was Quapaw like when you were younger?  10  McFarland When I come to Quapaw in 1925, we had two railroads: one on the east  side, and one on the west side. We had two lumberyards: one on the  east side, and one on the west. We had a movie theater, we had a casket  factory, we had a bottling works, we had a doctor that had his own  residence here in Quapaw, and he did his doctoring out of his office and  he lived a block off of Main Street. Dr. McKellen was his name. You  could get him any time you wanted him. He was a good old country  doctor. We had a dry goods store here that you could buy material and  clothes, and we had a hotel. We had two banks. That   s all I can  remember right now.  Finchum That   s bigger than I thought.  McFarland It was a thriving little town. There was a story that goes around about it  that Quapaw could have had the streetcar track when it came through  here, but the city dads were afraid that the money would be spent out of  town. So they wouldn   t let the streetcar come through Quapaw. It  bypassed us and went through Century that   s west of Quapaw   or was  west of Quapaw. It   s just brush now, I don   t think there   s any houses in  Century, but it was west of the high school three or four miles.  Finchum When you were in high school did you play any sports?  McFarland I played basketball, and I played softball. I played basketball in seventh  and eighth grade, and then I played in high school.  Finchum Were the courts inside or outside?  McFarland The courts were inside. We had a gym here in Quapaw, but I was never  good at track or anything like that, but I did play basketball.  Finchum What kind of outfit would you play in?  McFarland Oh you had a gym suit, but it had legs about halfway to your knees, and  it was pretty well covered up in the chest area and all.  Finchum What position did you play?  McFarland Guard. I got in trouble one time because I didn   t think the referee was  doing whatever just exactly right and I told him off about it. Then I had  to go and apologize to him when we went to school on Monday, but that  is   the way it is, is the way it is. I didn   t like it, didn   t think he was fair  and a lot of others  didn   t either , but they didn   t have the guts, we  called it, to go and tell them.  Finchum But you did.  11  McFarland I did.  Finchum Did your parents make you apologize or did the teacher?  McFarland Superintendent asked me to. He asked me to, he didn   t make me. He  asked me to and I did. I used to be the one that did the fighting for my  two sisters and all. That came from my father because when my brother  was walking that mile and a quarter to school, the big kids made him  walk in the timber. They wouldn   t let him walk on the road, and they  stole his lunch, and so my dad just   when he found out what was going  on, he just got on his riding horse and down to their house he went. He  told that man he said,    I   m coming down to see you this time to tell you  how your boys are acting, but I want you to know the next time I come  I   ll rip the stuffing out of you.    My dad was quite a fighter for the  underdog. He was not a professional, but he was darn good with his  hands. His principles were on   you had to be good to reach them. My  dad never swore, never smoked, but he drank a beer once in a while  when he worked in the mines, but that   s     Finchum That   s the way it was I guess.  McFarland That   s the way it was with him.  Finchum Who would discipline the children?  McFarland Both of them. They never fussed over the   they agreed before they  punished.  Finchum And how would they punish typically?  McFarland You got a paddling.  Finchum With a belt, or a hickory, or what?  McFarland Oh, a switch.  Finchum And were you ornery enough to see that happen a little bit?  McFarland Oh I   ve always been ornery. I   ve always been active and not   I wasn   t  one of these that sits on the back row.  Finchum Well in high school, what was your favorite subject?  McFarland I don   t know, but I graduated third in my class. I made the honor roll  and one of my grandsons found my book with names in it and he asked  12  me if he could have it with my name in it, and I said yes. You just were  about due for a paddling if you didn   t make a good grade. I never failed  any subject, and I didn   t have a   my brother never, my sisters never.  Our school came first. Education was it. My brother, as I said, had a  master   s in science. My sister worked in Washington, D.C. as a  secretary in the IRS  Internal Revenue Service . She took the  examination and passed it and went up there. She was a secretary in  Joplin before she went to Washington.  Finchum Where did your brother get his master   s?  McFarland Pittsburgh  State University .  Finchum That   s pretty close to here?  McFarland Yes, but you know teachers used to not get very much money, and they  taught all these months and then they borrowed money to go to school  to further their education. I think my brother started for about  65 a  month. You know, back there in    29 and    30s was what they   They  didn   t get any money   Finchum Did any of them have to serve in the military, in the war?  McFarland Any of my folks? My brother didn   t, he was a schoolteacher, and he  also worked in this General Power here that was making  projectiles ,  doing the Army   s work. Then my husband, he worked there too. He was  a foreman of the night shift. None of my immediate went. Now my  brother-in-law, my sister   s husband, was one of the   he was the nearest  to a doctor they had when the United States transferred the twenty-five  destroyers to Canada back in that age. He was a pharmacist, and he was  the nearest doctor they had on board those ships when they moved.  That   s all they sent. Then he was at Pearl Harbor when they bombed it,  and his ship had to go into Bremerton, Washington, for about six  months to be repaired. My sister transferred from Washington,  D.C.  to  Bremerton, Washington, to be out there while he was there, but he  didn   t have to move out from the coast. He went different places. So she  just stayed in Washington, and Oregon where they lived when they both  died.  Finchum Pretty place out there.  McFarland Oh, it is. I like the coast and things. I like to visit in California, but I  don   t want to live out there.  Finchum Quapaw   s home, huh?  13  McFarland Well yes, and they have pretty flowers, but you have them here if you  cultivate them.  Finchum That   s true. How did you meet your husband?  McFarland He had dated a cousin of mine, it was a step-cousin of mine, up there.  He lived in Duenweg, he and his family did, and this cousin, step-cousin  of mine   My uncle and them all went to the same church in  Duenweg. I met him through them.  Finchum What would you do for dates?  McFarland You went to the movie, you could go for about ten cents or something.  If you waited until weekends and went you got to see a serial western,  where it cut off a week before. You also got, sometimes, a dish or  something like that as a little prize.  Finchum How did he pop the question?  McFarland    I guess we better get the dirty work done this time, this week.    We   d  talked about it, he was a kidder too.    Better get the dirty work done.     We were married in January I guess it was, January 1935. Our oldest  child was born in April of 1936. Then we had twins two years later.  Finchum Handful.  McFarland What?  Finchum Were they a handful?  McFarland My mother entered into the picture and took care of them during the  daytime. She needed the income I would pay her, because my dad had  miner   s silicosis by then, so she needed the income. We lived there a  long, long, time before we bought a house here in Quapaw. We bought  a house at the south edge here at Quapaw. We built that round-top  building. That was a grain company, a feed and grain that we ran. Then  we moved to a farm down south of Narcissa  Oklahoma . We bought  one down there and moved down there.  Finchum And you were working too?  McFarland I worked for sixty-six years, and I worked all the time.  Finchum Doing what? Doing what type of work?  14  McFarland That   s where I got part of this arthritis. I   ve been the janitor, but I  always was the boss   s secretary, and I was a bookkeeper, and I was   if  they had to hire and fire anybody, I was what you called Girl Friday I  guess. (Laughter) I worked for   I never had but two bosses really. The  last one I worked for was in Miami and that was Ed Walker. He had  realty property, he had pharmacies, and he had nursing homes. He put  the pharmacies in the Wal-Mart stores as they came in the district and  the area, and up in Missouri, and up in Kansas, and down in Oklahoma.  When Wal-Mart started, you know, they didn   t own the pharmacy or  the shoe department or those. They rented out the space to them. They  had all these nursing homes. They had five nursing homes and  pharmacies. I   ve forgotten how many now, but then they had rental  property, and they still have rental property here in town.  Finchum If you worked sixty-six years, how old were you when you retired?  McFarland I retired in 2001, so eighty-five, eighty-six.  Finchum That   s a long time to work.  McFarland Well I was ready to quit before I did, but they didn   t seem to find  anybody. Finally I said,    I   m out of here,    on a certain day,    If you do,  alright, and if you don   t, alright.    Course I wouldn   t have ever done that  to them, but they found somebody.  Finchum Were you still driving at that time?  McFarland Yes, I still drove. I didn   t quit driving, I think, until I was ninety-four. I  was afraid of what the other fellow was going to do, and I was afraid of  what Martha was going to do. So I said,    It   s time to quit.     Finchum Decided on your own.  McFarland Yes, my son wanted to take the car away from me several years before I  gave it up, because he didn   t think I was capable. The two girls said,     Now listen, if you want to take Mother where she wants to go, whether  she needs to go or don   t need to go, you want to go pick her up and do  the driving, alright, we   ll let you take the car away.    He didn   t want that  so I drove longer than that.  Finchum Sounds like they got some of your stubborn streak.  McFarland Every one of them, and every one of them has green eyes   hazel eyes.  You see mine?  Finchum Yes.  15  McFarland Anyway, my three children are like three old hens with one little  chicken, and I   m that chicken. Does that tell you how devoted they are  to me?  Finchum Yes.  McFarland I have seven grandchildren, and about seventeen great-grandchildren. I  will have, before long, eleven fifth generation great-great-grandchildren.  I already have ten, and we   re expecting  three more .  Finchum How do you keep up with all of them?  McFarland I write them down. Usually when I get a new calendar I put all the     Finchum Birthdays in?  McFarland    all of them on there, but I don   t participate in any of the birthday  parties and things anymore, because it was just too much. I just can   t do  it. Now they had a party Saturday night for one of them. My great-grandson   s  wife, she graduated from school at Claremore  OK , and her  hometown there in Baxter had a party for her   graduation party. I  didn   t go. Night would be bad for me anyway. I am extra careful with  where I step and where I walk.  Bishop You say you don   t go to many of the parties that they have, what about  your 100th birthday party?  McFarland I went to it.  Bishop And how was your party? What was it like?  McFarland We had fifty-one at the dinner at the restaurant. I   ve forgotten how  many came for cake and ice cream, out to my daughter   s that day, but  we had an awful lot. I had a niece that   s a lawyer in Washington, D.C.  and she came from Washington, D.C., and her sister was a surgeon, but  she   s retired. She came, her home  is  in California. I had quite a few  from Houston, and all around. An article in the paper the other day told  how many from all the different places that came, but they bring me  flowers. (Laughter) Well, there   s not a lot of other things that they  could bring me.  Finchum There isn   t.  McFarland I don   t need any clothes because I emptied three clothes closets when I  quit work because I didn   t need all those clothes. Then when I came up  16  here my daughter emptied about three more  She said,    You don   t need  all those,    and I don   t.  Finchum Did you ever think you would live to 100? Did you think you   d make it  to 100?  McFarland I had no idea that I   d ever live to be 100. While I was growing up and  everything, people didn   t live to be 100. I really never thought a lot  about it, it just seemed to happen. When I got on up there to ninety, and  passed ninety, I began to wish I   d live to be 100 to see what it   d be like.  The biggest thing is being in this wheelchair.  Finchum That   s the biggest challenge?  McFarland That   s the biggest one. Now I walked with a different kind of a walker  when I came here, somehow I got in this. But they promised me they   d  help me walk behind my walker again as soon as they get through with  a girl they   re working on. They don   t do therapy here, but two or three  of the nurses have kind of taken over and are helping some that need  some help. So they said they   d help me. I was walking behind a walker,  a Rollator. Somehow I got in this wheelchair.  Finchum How long have you been in here?  McFarland I came in March, I   m going on two years.  Finchum You lived at home until then?  McFarland What?  Finchum You lived at home until then?  McFarland Yes, by myself   except a cat. I had an educated cat. I   d had her   she  was about eighteen years old. She knew everything I said, and she  would do it. She slept on my bed and of the mornings when we got up, I  had a dresser  drawer  that I left open about that far (gestures) so I  could reach out and hold of it and get up. She   d hop over on the table  and get on that little edge, walk over to my walker, and wait for me.  Then she   d ride in into the living room. She wanted to be brushed and  everything first, so that   s what we did. I could ask her if she wanted  outdoors, she knew where the door was to go outdoors. She   d go out  with me to get the paper, and then come back. If I said I had to go to the  bathroom, she got down and she run to the bathroom, got on the edge of  the bathtub and waited for me.  17  If I asked her if she was hungry, she knew what I meant. Asked her if it  was bedtime   why, she was ready to go to bed, and if I wasn   t ready to  go to bed, she was. She knew what time to get up, and what time I was  supposed to get up. She knew what she wanted to eat and that   s what I  gave her to eat. I could open the side of my refrigerator, the freezer side  of my side-by-side, take out frozen chicken, and she could be clear in  the other part of the house, and she knew I took out frozen chicken  because she came and started crying. She was half calico and   I   ll tell  you in a minute, but she had that old whiney-cry, Siamese. She had that  old whiney cry they have, and that   s the way she   d cry for that frozen  chicken, and I   d have to shave off her a bite or two of frozen chicken  and she was alright.  Bishop What was her name?  McFarland What   d you ask me for?  Bishop What was the cat   s name?  McFarland What   d you ask me for? I know it as well as my own name     Finchum It   ll come to you.  McFarland But she was a   had Siamese marking.  Finchum And she was eighteen?  McFarland And she was eighteen years old. How I came by her, she was a little  bitty kitten and one of my grandson   s had it. His mother was going to  have another baby and they couldn   t have a cat around on account of  the litterbox. When the baby was born, why, the dad wouldn   t let the cat  come home, so Grandma got the cat. That wasn   t the first animal I fell  heir to that way.    Grandma will keep it for us,    so Grandma kept the cat  or the dog for a time. Why   d you ask me her name for? I know it as  well as I know my own  (Laughs)  Bishop She sounded like a pretty smart cat.  McFarland She was  I said she was educated. She was a beautiful color. She had  the ears and the tail of a Siamese, you know the sable brown, and then  she had a few calico markings on her.  Finchum Sounds like she had you trained   McFarland Oh, I was her slave. She knew what she wanted. She knew when it was  time to go to bed, when to get up.  18  Finchum When you were growing up did you have pets?  McFarland Oh heavens, I had every chicken that had a broken leg or every bird that  couldn   t fly, or anything like that.  Finchum Your family raised chickens?  McFarland Oh we raised chickens, and we had ducks, and we had geese.  Finchum When it was time to kill them, who would do that?  McFarland Well my dad was there, and my brother. Sometimes he had hired hand.  Finchum Your mother didn   t have to?  McFarland She could if she needed to, and I did too  There are several ways you  can kill a chicken.  Bishop What was your preferred method? How did you do it?  McFarland Oh I just took a long stake and put it across the chicken   s neck and  pulled.  Bishop Would you eat it? Would you eat it right then? Like cook it later?  McFarland We   d cook it later. Yeah, when that   s your food, one of your basic  foods, you don   t think about how green in the face you   re going to get.  Finchum Quite a bit different than going to the freezer and getting one today,  isn   t it?  McFarland Oh my, my, my. They   re all cut up in the freezer. If you want them, and  cooked if you want them.  Finchum You mentioned earlier that you were a member of     McFarland A member of the Eastern Star, a member of the White Shrine, and a  member of the Amaranth. I   ve been a member of White Shrine and  Eastern Star for over sixty years, and I   ve been a member of Amaranth  for over thirty years.  Finchum I   m not familiar with that one.  McFarland It   s not as well-known I don   t think, as the White Shrine is. Mine was  Gethsemane Shrine.  The Miami White Shine  didn   t have enough  19  attendance and so they consolidated with the  Shine in Joplin,  Missouri . I   m past officer in all of them, served on lots and lots of  committees. My most interesting committee that I ever served on, and I  served for years, was what we called our Material Objective. I paid a  penny a week,  .52 a year, into that fund just like every other member  did. We operated on people and we got them glasses, and years ago  there wasn   t any limit on what we could spend, but we have a limit  now. One of my most interesting cases was a little girl in Jay,  Oklahoma that needed a heart transplant. Dr. Debake in Dallas   or  Houston, operated on her when she was just about five years old or so. I  followed her all the way through high school and she got to where she  could play sports and things. That was the most interesting to see her  progress.  Course we bought glasses, and we bought teeth, and we did everything  else. The most disgusting one I ever sat on, there was three on the  committee, was over in Seneca, Missouri, and two  schoolteachers   And when the committee walked in we asked what  progress they   d made with the doctor, for finding one to work on the  girl. They said,    Well, we haven   t done anything. We   ve been waiting  to see what you would do.    Most parents would have moved heaven  and earth to have found something before waiting on somebody else.  We couldn   t take that case because it was in Missouri and we had  boundaries. The Shrine was in Miami then. We were in their  jurisdiction.  Like for instance, we had a little boy born out at Wellston  Oklahoma   that had a cleft palate and harelip. We operated on him for both of those  things. You couldn   t operate on two of them at the same time. We had  to wait until he was so old for part of it, but he had a cleft palate. It was  just wonderful what they did, and I really liked that. I can   t tell you how  many years I served on that. Seemed like I served forever.  Finchum Like to help others.  McFarland Yes.  Finchum Was church an important part of growing up?  McFarland Oh, church was very important growing up, but I didn   t attend church  all that often after I was grown. I went with my kids when they were  little, but then I   ve kind of got out of that habit, but I   ve been in here.  Finchum I   m not going to ask you to sing a favorite church song.  McFarland Oh, I hope you don   t ask me to sing.  20  Finchum You were reciting a poem? Shakespeare?  McFarland Something from Shakespeare.  Finchum Can you say that again for us?  McFarland    Know ye this, to thine own self be true, and it must follow, the day as  the night. Thou canst not then be false to any man.    I like Shakespeare.  Does that make me odd? (Laughter)  Finchum No.  McFarland I had a set of Shakespeare books I gave away one time here a while  back, because I wasn   t using them anymore. I love those sayings like  that.  Finchum How did you get interested in him, Shakespeare?  McFarland I don   t know, I don   t know.  Bishop What   s your favorite play or work by Shakespeare?  McFarland I couldn   t even tell you that. I don   t pay attention to the plays, I pay  attention to the writings.  Bishop What   s your favorite?  McFarland Well that one   s my favorite, and the evening prayer are two of my  favorites.  Bishop The evening prayer? What   s that?  McFarland    If I wounded any soul today, Dear Lord forgive. If I have walked in  my own willful way, Dear Lord forgive.    You know it   s a song?  Finchum I haven   t heard it, I   ll have to look it up.  McFarland Well you look it up. If people paid attention to some of the things like  that that they sing and say, it   d be a lot better world. There   s meaning in  every bit of it just like the one in Shakespeare that I told you. If you   re  true to yourself you   re not going to be false to anybody else.  Bishop Very true.  21  McFarland If you think about it. If you think about the Evening Prayer,    If I  wounded any soul today,    if you said something or did something that  wounds somebody then you   re praying   you know you did it. It should  be a lesson to you.  Finchum And you go and apologize to the referee.  McFarland Yeah  I probably needed to apologize more times than I had, but you  know    sorry   , to say you   re sorry is just something you say, but it   s the  hardest thing in the world for people to say is    I   m sorry.    Have you  ever noticed it?  Finchum I have.  McFarland It   s the hardest thing for people to say.  Bishop Did you ever travel in your life?  McFarland Well, I   ve been to Canada, straight north, I don   t know, two or three  times. I   ve been to Nova Scotia, I   ve been to Hawaii, I   ve been to  Australia, and I   ve been to Old Mexico time after time. I   ve been to  Buffalo, New York. I   ve been to Miami, Florida. We used to go to  Ponca City about every two weeks. My daughter and son-in-law live  down there, and two grandsons. We   d go down to   when they lived at  Houston, we   d go over to Old Mexico every now and then. My sister  lives at El Paso, and we   d go over to Mexico from there.  Bishop What was your favorite place you ever visited?  McFarland Quapaw. (Laughter) No, as I said before, California is beautiful, but I  wouldn   t want to live there. I wouldn   t want to live in a great, big, big  city either. I don   t know what would be my favorite. You can have all  the flowers here that you have anyplace else, if you have room for them.  Finchum Quapaw   s an Indian name, isn   t it?  McFarland Yes it is. So is Miami, now that   s My-am-ah, not My-am-y. Seneca   s an  Indian name, Tahlequah   s an Indian name, Peoria is an Indian name,  and what else is around here     Finchum Did you have much interactions with them growing up?  McFarland With Indians?  Finchum Yes.  22  McFarland I don   t fault the Indians one single cent that they get out of the  government because stop and think, our forefathers did the same thing  that these foreign countries are doing. Pushing countries back, this  country belonged to the Indians. There was tribes all over the United  States and we pushed them back. Course we cannot pay forever for  what our forefathers did, but they pushed the Indians right back. Just  exactly like those foreigners are doing to some of the countries over  there. Anything the Indians can get out of the government, the  government owes them.  Finchum I thought you might   ve had school with some.  McFarland Oh, Quapaw used to have Indians go to schools. The Whitebirds, the  street   s name for out here, they went here. Ellen was the girl   s name.  Robert, Jr., was the son. When some Indian died they used to have a big  feast the day of the funeral. Anyone who wanted to come could come to  it. Peoria is an Indian name.  Bishop Did you ever go to any of those feasts? Did you ever attend any of those  feasts? You were talking about in the funeral, did you ever attend any of  the funerals?  McFarland No, we never did because we weren   t Indian. I didn   t have a drop of  Indian blood in me, but a lot of people that weren   t Indians attended.  You were invited to attend if you wanted to.  Bishop So the community, the whole community was invited?  McFarland Yeah. I can remember when Ottawa County was taboo to the colored  man, too. They didn   t dare spend the night in Ottawa County. When I  was little you didn   t see any Negroes, because they weren   t allowed to  stay in the county overnight. That   s shameful.  Finchum It is.  McFarland They bleed just as red as we do. All are going to the same place. I just  think it   s terrible how our forefathers did them   made slaves out of  them. Bought and sold.  Finchum It   s hard to imagine, isn   t it?  McFarland No, you can   t imagine. I liked history in school, but I liked mathematics  better than anything. That is one of my biggest   well the biggest thing I  regret, was that I was qualified to take a CPA  Certified Public  Accountant  examination. I had the training because I worked for a  CPA, extra to my other work that   I worked for him during the summer  23  when you made up the budgets, and when people made their income  tax. You just have to type everything. So I typed all the time for him,  and I sometimes sorted out from somebody   s account and put things in  the right places and studied. I had bookkeeping and machine banking  and all that business stuff. I went out to the college and had some  auditing and accounting and things, so I was qualified to do it.  This CPA, I   m telling you about lived at Picher, had a stepson and he  wanted both of us to go and take a CPA exam. I didn   t think I   d have to  work all my life. I thought I was just going to work a few years and help  get started and then live a life of luxury, but there was no luxury on the  farm. (Laughs) At that time we had moved, my husband and I, had  moved down south of Narcissa to the farm. We bought a farm down  there, and he thought that   s what he wanted to do so we moved on the  farm. So I kept working.  Finchum And didn   t take the CPA?  McFarland I wished I would have taken the examination. Not for the monetary in  particularly, but for myself.  Finchum Sure.  McFarland Course I   d have made a lot more money, probably. I figured my social  security out and worked the years that I figured would be to my  advantage, if I needed to go to a nursing home. I called it just about  right.  Finchum Good thinker and plan ahead.  McFarland I   m a pretty good thinker. I can add two and two together, and I get  people, you know. Some people you can read them just like books.  Bishop Do you have anything on your bucket list? Something on your bucket  list? Anything you want to do that you   ve never done before?  McFarland No, I used to think I wanted to go to the Holy Land, but I just never did.  I was gone a month on the Australia trip   three weeks.  Bishop That   s a long time   McFarland Yes, it is.  Bishop Did you enjoy that trip?  24  McFarland I enjoyed it, but there was eighty-one people in that tour. It was an  Amaranth tour, and there was eighty-one people and took five buses to  haul us. When you got to an eating place the first bus is already gone  when the last one got there to eat. So you didn   t get to be with the  people that were in the tour really that much. But we went to that big  opera house in Sydney, and we went to a little island out off of  Australia and had dinner. Oh, they have lots of food in there   places  like that. They have   you can eat all the time, all day.  They don   t have many wooden roofs over there, they didn   t at that time,  because they don   t have the trees and the wood like other countries.  They have tile that is shipped in that they put on the roofs, but they have  groves. They   ve planted groves of cedar trees and evergreens. They call  them their social security because they have a big field of them and  when they get old enough they think those trees will do for them what  our social security does for us. Course they live longer now so it  wouldn   t go very far. A grove wouldn   t go very far here either. In fact  they   re trying to get rid of some of the red cedar here.  Finchum They   re a nuisance to the farmers.  McFarland That   s one thing they   re working on out of OSU. I guess it   s right out of  where you   re from. I have  two grandsons and one great-granddaughter  that graduated from OSU .  Finchum Let   s talk about what you do today. What time did you get up this  morning?  McFarland I got up a little before six.  Finchum Alarm clock or just woke up?  McFarland This up here woke up (gestures to head), and this woke up (gestures to  stomach). If I go to bed too early of the evenings, I want to wake up  about two or three o    clock. The rest of the neighbors don   t want to get  up then. I woke up around a little before six this morning, but I didn   t  get up until six. This is the first morning that I haven   t dressed myself in  I don   t know when, but I usually can get all of my clothes on except  maybe my underwear. If I   m in a low enough chair I can put my  underwear on. I put my dress on, and house shoes on, and comb my  hair, brush my teeth, wash my face, and I usually have a little spit bath  in the lavatory. We don   t get a bath every day. We have certain days of  the week we get it, because they have so many. I got to have one every  day and we have a real  nice  one of the ladies, that works part-time and  goes to NEO  Northeastern Oklahoma A M  to be some kind of a  25  technician, is a former beauty operator. She fixes my hair every  Saturday.  Finchum Looks good.  McFarland I like my hair done.  Finchum What time do you go to bed normally?  McFarland Sometimes it   s nine, nine thirty. If the NBA   s playing it   s a little later.  If I want to see something else   I don   t understand football, but I watch  it anyway. I like the action.  Finchum Which team are you pulling for in the NBA?  McFarland Well, I was pulling for Oklahoma   s Thunder, but I didn   t pull hard  enough  (Laughter) But now I missed part of last night   s because I  didn   t stay up that late. It   s usually nine thirty or so before I  go to bed .  If I go to bed too early, I wake up about two o   clock and then I   m  through for the night.  Finchum During the day what do you do?  McFarland I go down to breakfast about seven o   clock and usually it   s after nine  before we get through. Then Allison usually has something in   lessons  or exercise or Bingo or something. Now we   ve been doing manners,  good manners, the last two days. Then I go to my room and it   s just  about time to eat. Then I go back to eat. Then it   s probably after one  before I get through and I come back and I watch TV. I have a tape  player in my room. I don   t play it too often. I   ve got a lot of tapes for it.  Sometimes I play that, sometimes I watch TV, sometimes I sleep     mostly I sleep. I don   t know, for some reason when you get older you  require more sleep and I sleep more than I did before.  Finchum You do much reading?  McFarland My eyes are  bad . I have that macular degeneration that lots of older  people have. Both eyes are stable, but I went to a specialist in Tulsa for  every six months for a long, long time. I haven   t been this six months,  but one eye is stronger than the other and I don   t tax them. I used to  work a lot of word puzzles. I   ve got a word puzzle book that thick, two  of them, in my room. I love to work them, but I do not tax my eyes  because I want to keep them as long as I can. Of course I wear hearing  aids, and I   ve worn those for quite a while. That doesn   t bother me like  my eyes. I don   t have to tax   I don   t have to be careful with them like I  do my eyes. They don   t focus so good in the morning, sometimes I have  26  to ask what time it is if it   s time to get up. Now I can see right around  this room and you all, but I just don   t see as well.  Bishop What do you think your secret is to living a long life?  McFarland I don   t know what it is, but now I have three children and I   m in better  shape than either one of the three. My son has to have oxygen twenty-four  hours a day, and he   s seventy-seven or will be this month. My  oldest girl, she   s seventy-nine and she has a bad back and hip and goes  to the doctor for everything. And my twin girl to the boy, she   s got a  bad back, and she   s had her knees operated on. She lost an upper part of  one of her lungs when she was real young. Now the only surgery that  I   ve had that   s major was the hysterectomy when I was fifty-one years  old, and I   ve had my hands operated on for cysts. That   s not a major  thing, so I   ve only had the major one thing. I had the measles and I had  the chicken pox when I was a kid. My vitals are very, very good for  someone 100 years old. Every one of them is     Finchum Blood pressure   s good?  McFarland My blood pressure   s in line with what it should be, and they   re just  amazed at it. Now I worked hard.  Finchum That may be your secret.  McFarland It may be. Course I didn   t party all my life either. I did my share of  going to dances and things like that, never did learn how to dance worth  a ding, but anyway I went. Our neighborhood, when I was kid, there  was five or six kids all about the same age and families in there. We  always got together when we all went, course you walked where you  went. We   d go to another   s house and have card games or dances or  something, but we walked. All those kids just met and walked together,  so we didn   t get out in party. You didn   t party that way when I was a  kid, drink and things like that. Now I think during the war that more  people drank than any other age or event because it seemed like  everybody had to have a bottle     Finchum And smoked more then   cigarette.  McFarland I never did smoke, I never could remember to smoke. My two girls tried  it and so I   d buy a package of cigarettes, figuring I would smoke them  and they   d come home and say,    Mother, do you have anything to  smoke around here?    I   d say,    Well it   s on the table in there.    It   d had  been there on the table for two weeks, and I never could remember to  smoke. I never learned to inhale, I guess is what my problem was. Oh  27  when you   re kids you tried grapevines and all that kind of stuff, you  know. Didn   t you ever hear of that? (Laughs)  Bishop No.  Finchum No.  Bishop Did you try to smoke a grapevine?  McFarland Why kids did, then they did, and all that kind of stuff when they was  kids. They all went through a different phase than kids do now. They  weren   t near as serious about it, it was just sneaking around then. It   s  serious with kids now. I never learned, my brother never smoked, my  younger sister, she might   ve tried it, but I don   t think my older one did.  Bishop If history were written today, what would you want it to say about you?  McFarland About the same thing.  Bishop If history were written today, how would you want to be remembered?  McFarland I want to be remembered for my devotion in my family, because as I  say, I never had a child get in trouble with the law or anything, or get  arrested, or spend the night in jail. They were never accused of stealing  anything or anything like that. I think when you raise them with those  thoughts in mind, you   ve accomplished something.  Finchum And they   re the three hens and you   re the chicken.  McFarland They   re the three old hens with one little chicken and they all like the  chicken.  Finchum So you raised them right?  McFarland They are all devoted to me.  Finchum You did a good job then.  McFarland Yeah, I feel like I did.  Finchum I think you did.  McFarland That   s the reason that I   m here in Quapaw. I   m near to Miami and this  is a nice little  facility . They looked and thought this was the nicest  place. This place has some things that you might want in another, and  28  some things you might not want in another. You can   t be 100 percent  on any of them at any time on anything, actually.  Finchum So we   ve given you a few minutes, have you thought of your cat   s name  yet?  McFarland Hadn   t even thought of it.  Finchum Okay.  McFarland I   ll tell you     Finchum I was just checking back.  McFarland I   ll tell you now   isn   t that funny? You forget the name of something  so close to you?  Finchum We usually like to ask, do you have a favorite recipe that you like to  cook?  McFarland I had a   not particularly my favorite dish, but I had a recipe for  chocolate cake that used cinnamon in it. In Eastern Star and these other  things, I always had to do that, make one of those, because everybody  liked it so well and it was so moist. Particularly the men liked the cake,  but it had some cinnamon in it. Another thing I liked to make was  dressing, because I made dressing from the bottom, up   scratch.  Everyone   I was the dressing lady. I had to make the dressing.  Finchum What would you put in it?  McFarland I put the customary stuff in it, but it was in the way I mixed it up. Put a  lot of eggs in it and I never allowed anybody to stir it after it went into  the oven, because your bread and everything   s already been baked once  and you don   t need to make mush out of it. I always had to make it     had sage in it. It was just regular old-fashioned, toast and bread heels,  whatever you had.  And I was so old-fashioned that for so long I cooked my celery in one  pan and my onions in another and then mixed them together. (Laughter)  I used to get the job of being the organizer      If Martha will organize it,  we   ll do the work.    So they called me    The Organizer.       If Martha will  organize the dinner, then we   ll do the work,    and they did. I was really  chairman of the dinners and see that who did what, and which, and why  for so many of them.  Finchum And then brought the cake. What made the cake moist?  29  McFarland I don   t remember. I remember you use Crisco in it. I haven   t made it for  several years, and I hope they saved my recipe box. I   m sure they did. It  was just moist. It had eggs in it and the regular things, but I can   t  remember   But in the icing you made for it you put Crisco in a pan and  melted it, and chocolate and the other which you used quite a bit of  Crisco in the icing. So that made it moist     Finchum And good.  McFarland    but I used to have a pan about as big as   made a cake and a half. I  always made a cake and a half in that. Then they fussed over who got to  take home if any of it was left. Just something you enjoyed doing. I  used to do lots of   I did lots of work on all those orders because I  worked at them. I was past officer and I did a lot of installing of new  officers, because I knew how. I didn   t forget the names like I have my  cat. (Laughter)  Finchum It   ll come to you.  McFarland Sure it will. It   s just as well as I know my own name. I brushed and  combed her every morning for years   Finchum It wasn   t just Kitty then, it was something else.  McFarland I had one named Kitty, too. I had a cat named Kitty, once.  Finchum Alright, we won   t    ask you much more. Thank you very much for talking  with me today. It   s been fun.  McFarland Hope I haven   t bored you.  Finchum Oh no, you were great. You were great.  -------  -------
