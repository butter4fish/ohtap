 Ahrberg and today is October 15, 2009. I am visiting  with Kathy Ellis Wood and Harriett Wright Dolezalek in Stillwater,  Oklahoma. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Thank you, ladies, for  coming and sharing your stories with us today. I just want to welcome  you back to campus for your Women of Willard reunion. I   m glad you  can share your stories. Let   s start off and have you tell me about your  early life, where you grew up, your family, your school, and some of the  activities you participated in school.  I grew up in Fort Supply, Oklahoma, a little town of 365. I participated  mainly in sports. And then I went to Oklahoma State of 15-18,000  people and it was culture shock. (Laughter)  I grew up in Erick, Oklahoma, which is about halfway between Amarillo  and Oklahoma City on Old Highway 66. My dad was a lawyer there and  his law office was at the corner of Highway 66 and Main Street. In my  early years I would go up and sit in the window and watch the world go  by. I learned my geography from all of the car license plates of cars  going by. Erick at that time was a town of about 1,500. I was very active  in basketball, played basketball, was in the band, glee club, just almost  anything and everything, because in a school that size you could do that  because there weren   t enough people to go around. I went right from  high school to Stillwater. I had been in the band and had visited campus  a number of times on band contests, so it wasn   t totally new to me but,  still, being there after graduating in a class of twenty-five was somewhat  of a culture shock, yes.  Would you like to add any more?  5  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Yes, I was in the band in Fort Supply my senior year, and it was the first  year of the band. And so when I came to Oklahoma State, I was in the  band the first year, in marching band, and I remember when it was time  for the winter sports and fall sports, the instructor divided us into two  halves and then we   d go to the various sports events and be a pep band.  The first time, I had to go to a wrestling match. I thought,    Oh, dear, this  is going to be a long evening,    (laughter) because all I   d ever seen was  the horrible stuff on television. And from the first match, I  was at   every wrestling match. I loved wrestling, and of course we were so good  at that time and probably still are. I don   t know.  What were your instruments that you played?  I played flute, flute and piccolo.  And I played snare drum. My parents couldn   t afford an instrument for  one year, so I played the school snare drum.  And what were the sizes of your graduating class? You   ve already  mentioned it, I think.  Twenty-five.  Eighteen.  Which was large; twenty-five was a large class for there.  Were there a lot of people out of your graduating classes that went to  college at that time?  Not a lot. There were about four of us that came to Stillwater, and a few  went other places, but not very many.  What do you think was the reason they came? Or, in your particular  instance, why did you come to OSU?  Because having visited the campus, and we   d also been to Norman, I  always liked coming to Stillwater so much better. It was just much  friendlier.  A friendlier campus. How about you, Harriett?  Well, I recall a good half of my class going to college, and several  finished college. But in Fort Supply, there was just nothing, or in the  adjoining town, Woodward, out almost in the Panhandle. And so quite a  few went on to college from that little school of 200, first grade through  6  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  twelfth. I came to Stillwater because my daddy did. He was a charter  member of Sigma Nu.  Oh, really?  Yes, he partied a lot. (Laughter) So, I decided to come here.  So, what year did you enroll at OSU?  1955.  And    56.  And you mentioned your first impressions, that you just really liked the  campus. Was it the architecture? Was it the people that really drew you  to it?  Probably the people more at that point in time. And I can   t give you  specific examples, but it was, I think, just a feeling that we got. And I  wasn   t the only one that felt this way in the band. Also, I had decided by  then to major in home economics, so this was the     Which OSU was known for it at that time for a very fine department.  Oh, yes. Yes.  How about you?  Well, I only visited the campus once. I came with   you   ve probably  interviewed Mary Eva Nemecek already. She had come here the year  before, she and Kathy, so I came to visit her. But I didn   t really tour the  campus or anything. I just knew I was going to come here.  What about your impression of Stillwater as a town? Were you able to  see much of town at all?  You know, I really don   t think very much because we didn   t have cars,  and really most of our life was on the campus. Occasional trips to town,  but really very few.  What years did you live in Willard Hall?  The whole time. Pretty much from 1955 to    59.  So, all four years.  7  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Pretty much. I finished in January of 1959 so, technically, probably three  and a half years. And you lived all four?  All four, yes. I started in    56 and finished in    60.  What was campus like back then? Was it calm? It was just before the     60s. Nobody knew what was ahead, did they?  No.  No.  Nobody ever thought of what was going to come hit us, did they?  Eisenhower was president, is that right?  Could be. (Laughter) Is that right? Okay. Virginia says yes.  Were you assigned to Willard Hall or did you specifically request  Willard?  I was assigned.  I believe I requested because one of the previous class, the class of    55,  was losing her roommate. Mary Eva knew that she needed a roommate,  and so I requested. And probably the other woman did, too.  That first day you walked into Willard Hall, what was your impression?  It   s kind of a grand old lady, the exterior and the interior. I mean, what  was it like to walk in there and have everybody trying to move in? It was  kind of chaotic, I would think.  Yes, probably chaos, but I think I was just very excited and was so ready  to leave home. So, I was very glad and was anxious for my parents to  leave. (Laughter)  That is so typical. You know some things just never change. How about  you?  That day is a blank for me. I don   t remember it at all. And I don   t  remember any burning wish to leave my home, but there was nothing  there for anyone, any young people. I remember just feeling like the  lobby of Willard was miles long, and if I went out the wrong door, I  didn   t know where I was. I   d never been in such a place. My family  never traveled. And I was telling Kathy, I didn   t know, when I started  school over there, that if you had a class, say, in Education Hall 315, I  didn   t know that   d be on the third floor. And that   s a very basic thing to  8  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  know. I didn   t even know that.  That   s interesting, yes. So, what were your rooms like?  Small. (Laughs)  Small.  They had double beds, I assume?  No, two single beds. And dressers. Did they? I think.  They must have. Yes, they had dressers and a desk.  Oh, maybe it was the desk rather than a dresser. Was it? I don   t  remember, but it wasn   t nearly enough room for two girls to get all their  stuff in.  Oh, my, no.  Really?  But could they be bunk beds?  I don   t think so.  Didn   t some people?  Did they?  I   m not sure.  I   ve heard some people say that they did bunk beds, but not everybody.  They did bunk beds. Okay, I never did.  And that made a little more space. I remember the steam pipes clanging.  Yes.  Oh, I   m telling you they just raised the roof when they   d turn on the heat  in the fall.  Was it extremely hot when they turned it on or did it control the  temperature?  9  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Not very well. And in the spring before they got it completely shut  down.  It was like an oven, huh?  Oh, my goodness, it was hot in there.  Did you all bring fans to keep cool?  No.  No.  Well, on campus at that time they had some air-conditioned new  buildings, the Student Union and the library. Did you all go over there  to keep cool?  Well, I don   t remember for that purpose. No, I don   t.  Was that your first time to experience air conditioning?  No.  Well, not to experience it, but to live in it, for sure.  Yes, I went to summer school between my freshman and sophomore  years. That was a little different experience. I took too many hours and  was totally overwhelmed with homework, and just barely got through  the summer.  Well, did you live in the dorms?  I lived in the dorms.  The dorms were open during the summer.  Yes. I think it was in Willard; I think I lived in Willard.  Did a lot of kids take school during the summer, or did a lot of them go  home?  Most went home, I think.  What was your reason for taking summer school?  Because I wanted to get out early.  10  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Do you all remember that floor phone? Can you tell us about your  experience with that floor phone? Was it hard to have personal  conversations? Was it used a lot?  Oh, it was always     It was always ringing, and nobody wanted to get up and go answer it. It  would ring and ring and ring, and finally somebody would break down  and go answer it.  And yell.  Should we tell about not Mary Beth, who was her roommate? The little  bitty girl. And Max would call.  Carol?  Yes, Carol Crowder. Should we tell?  Go ahead.  She was fighting with her boyfriend all the time. I don   t know if I should  tell that or not, (laughter) but she would get mad at her boyfriend all the  time and she always referred to him as    that damn Max.    And so if any  time the phone rang and it was for Carol Ann, somebody   d yell,    Carol  Ann, it   s damn Max     (Laughter)  And that probably was more said than you   d think, probably. (Laughs)  Would you use the phone to call home much?  No.  No. The only time     Everybody wrote letters, right?  Well. (Laughter)  The only time I ever called home was to ask permission to go  somewhere. If you left campus, you had to have permission. And the  house lady, what was her name?  Oh, Pryor, Mrs. Pryor?  No, that was the night lady.  11  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Proctor?  No. Anyway, she had to talk to your parents and hear them say you had  permission. And then you had to fill out a postcard telling them where  you were going, when you   d be back, and it got mailed home. So, if they  were talking to somebody bogus, well, the folks would find out.  (Laughter) Oh, gosh, I bet kids would have a fit if they heard that.  Where did you go off campus? Where would you like to go?  Oh, a band trip, or we went to Wichita with the football team.  So, even when you went as a school activity you had to do that.  Even when.  Was that only required for the women and not the men?  Oh, I   m sure, because the men had no dorm hours.  What do you know, wow. Tell us some about some of those band trips.  Were they fun? How did you all travel?  We went on a train to Wichita. That was a big deal. And I was only in  the band that one semester, and that was the only trip we took. So, I  don   t remember anything significant about it, no.  Did we win the game?  I don   t remember that either. (Laughter)  Now, you both lived on the second floor.  Right.  Were you on that west end that seems to have been the most popular  place?  Willard Two.  Tell us about your shower and restroom area. Apparently you had  community showers, so you shared this with other women. What was  that like for you? I mean, was it unique in the sense that you weren   t  used to having to share a shower with anyone? It   s so different  nowadays where kids just can   t understand that concept. They want their  own bathroom and so forth.  12  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Not really because the tubs were partitioned. The showers were  partitioned. It was like camp.  You didn   t have to wait like on Friday nights to get in there?  Probably, but I don   t remember it. If it was a big night, I   m sure.  Yes, I don   t remember anything.  There were like, what, six showers? And an awful lot of kids.  Yes, that   s a lot of women.  You could always go down the hall and find somebody else   s.  Yes, you could do that.  Go to a different shower.  Did you all used to roll your hair? I mean, everybody rolled their hair  back then; I assume everybody did. I mean, it   s how I kind of remember  the    50s.  Well, I would do it once a week. And sometimes if it was a special  occasion, I   d roll it and try to sleep on it like everybody else did. Those  rollers would be out of there in ten minutes.  It hurt, didn   t it?  I couldn   t do it.  I couldn   t either. I couldn   t either. I don   t think I ever wore my hair in  the big poof because I didn   t have the patience or the skill to do anything  about it, and I refused to sleep on the stuff.  Was Willard considered to be a popular or prestigious hall in its time?  Was it, kind of, when you said,    Willard,    did people go,    Wow, you   re  really lucky to be living in Willard   ?  I don   t recall anything like that.  I don   t either. I don   t either.  It was lucky because we had a public cafeteria. And that food was really  good because they were competing with restaurants and kids that could  go off campus. And so     13  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  So, was it used by the community? Did people     I don   t know. I don   t recall any adults.  Or just anybody from campus could drop in?  Anybody could go there.  Well, the Student Union was at one time a cafeteria. Was it like that  when you were there?  Yes.  So, how was the food there at that time it was a cafeteria?  I didn   t eat there very much because it was already paid for at the dorm.  And you used tickets, because you bought each dish. I believe it was  tickets.  At this time there was a restaurant called the Hideaway that came onto  the scene. Did you all have your first slice of pizza in college?  I don   t remember the Hideaway.  I don   t either. I don   t either.  Do you know where it was? Has anybody said where it was?  Well, it was over there south of campus. It started over there. It   s not in  its original location now, but it was south of campus. I know that pizza  was kind of a new     I had my first pizza after I moved to Denver.  You did?  I did.  Oh, my. That long?  That long.  I had pizza once on campus and I   m allergic to tomatoes. I didn   t realize  there was all this tomato sauce under the cheese.  14  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Oh, my gosh.  Oh, boy.  You were sick.  Yes.  So, if you went off campus to eat, where did you like to go eat? Was  there a special hangout?  Gosh.  Well, I was reminding people that I   m sure there was a place called  Cliff   s. It was a drive-in place.  I   ve heard of it.  Wonderful hamburgers and marvelous baked potatoes. We would go  there and have that once in a great while.  I don   t remember that.  You don   t?  Were they known for their milkshakes?  I don   t recall.  In your mind, what set Willard apart from other women   s halls in the  late 1950s? You had Stout and you had Murray Hall.  I think it was the people that lived there because, by then, we had our  little group and that   s, at least for me, what made it special.  Were Stout and Murray about the same size as Willard or was Willard  the bigger dorm?  I don   t know. I have a feeling Murray was smaller.  Well, I don   t remember well. And I think another thing was that it was  right in front of Theta Pond, which     A big plus.  And just across the gardens from the Student Union.  15  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  At that time did it seem far away to get to your classes or were they  really close?  Mine were separated a lot.  So, it felt like you weren   t just really right on the middle of campus like  it seems like it is now. Did it seem like it was further out?  Well, it seemed to me, but then I   m from Fort Supply. (Laughter)  Most of my classes were in the Home Ec Building.  Yes, I can see that. I   m going to talk about some of the traditions that  they   ve said that the Women of Willard have experienced. I   m hoping  that maybe you experienced them, too. Willard Beach, do you remember  anything about Willard Beach on the second floor, women crawling out  the windows to go lay out?  Don   t remember that one.  What about Christmas traditions? Do you remember singing carols or  setting up a Christmas tree?  (Laughter) Maybe very faintly in the main part of Willard, but I couldn   t  give you specifics.  Did we decorate doors?  I don   t know. Did we?  I   m not sure. I may have that seeped into school teaching.  Did Willard participate in any Homecoming events and contests? Did  you all do any pomping or enter a float or work with another residential  hall to participate in Homecoming?  I didn   t do anything, but it seems like there was something with a float  from Willard.  We might have had something in front of the dorm. I remember     Decoration?  Yes, it was goal posts and a papier-m  ch   kicker, and I remember the  song I Get a Kick Out of You playing over and over and over. (Laughter)  16  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  How about those scrapbooks? Do you remember anything about Willard  having dorm scrapbooks?  I never knew about a scrapbook.  What do you two remember about the 1955 panty raid?  That was before I got there.  But it was still such a significant event on campus that it     Yes, and I think Willard had been a part of that because there was  another gal from Erick that told about it. But, no, that was right,  probably the spring, before I came in the fall or something like that.  I   d forgotten about that.  Apparently it was pretty significant and some people haven   t forgotten.  I wish I had been there. I think it would have been fun.  Yes, it sounds like a blast. (Laughter)  Do you remember anything about your resident hall hours?  Early.  Oh, yes. (Laughter)  Can you tell me a little bit about that?  Well, as a freshman you had to be in your room studying at eight  o   clock. Was it sophomore and beyond that it was 10:30?  Something like that.  Or ten o   clock you had to be in Monday through Thursday, so kids were  running from every direction to get through the throng of smooching  students to get to the door. And then, we were talking, it was either  12:00 or 12:30 on Friday and Saturday night, and you better not be late.  I remember as a freshman, you were supposed to be in your room, and  the proctor, whoever it was, was supposed to check everybody. And I  was na  ve enough to, when I would just go to somebody else   s room, I  would have to go tell her that I was going to a different room. I woke up  to that, I thought,    My gosh, she must think I was really        17  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Did you go down room to room to meet, like when you came in from  class and you wanted to kick back? You didn   t stay in your room; you  went down to somebody else   s room to visit. Did you all do that?  Oh, yes.  And then maybe have a little party in there?  Oh, yes. Well, at noon, a lot, we   d get together to play cards.  Yes, oh yes.  Was it Oh Hell?  Oh Hell, yes.  That   s a card game?  (Laughter) Yes.  I never did play it because I never     Didn   t you?  No, I didn   t particularly like card games.  Oh, gosh, that was so     But a lot of people did.  What were some of the card games you played besides Oh Hell?  Well, we played Pitch, and some played Bridge but not much. I don   t  remember much about that. Oh Hell is like Double Solitaire and you try  to get rid of your cards first. And so all these decks of cards and  everybody   s screeching. And Joy Teters just would lose her mind; she  would get so nervous. And everybody yelling, it was fun. At noon.  Since you all had instruments, did you get to play in your room? Did  anyone ever come down and say,    Shhh, don   t play that instrument,    if  you had to practice or anything?  No, pretty much the music majors did that at the music area.  Where did you study? Did you study at the dorm or did you go to the  library?  18  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  I went to the library a lot and some in the dorm when you could.  I didn   t study a lot, (laughter) but when I did, I guess I went to the  library. It was more of a social thing, though. We   d go to the library  until nine o   clock, and then we   d head for the Student Union and the  fourth floor.  How late did it stay open?  Well, I don   t know but we had to be in by ten. So, I don   t know how late  it was open.  Did you feel safe on campus?  Oh, absolutely.  What were some of the special hall events or activities that you  remember? You talked about playing cards. Did you pull pranks on each  other?  We did some of that.  What did you do around finals week? Did everything just shut down  right before dead week or did they have dead week? Did things kind of  loosen up a little right before the holidays and everybody knew they  were going home and you kind of let loose a little bit?  Well, the schedules were all different during that time, so there was a  different movement, a different pattern for activities. And it was, in a  way, somewhat looser than during regular time.  You   d have hours off that you didn   t normally have.  Should be studying but you   re not.  Did any of you work?  I did.  Where did you work?  I worked in the sociology department half-time. That was hard. Kids  were studying in the afternoon while I was working, and then they were  playing in the evening when I should have been studying. So, that was  kind of hard. It was very hard.  19  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Do you remember anything about diversity at Willard? Were there any  ethnic or international students that lived in the dorm with you at that  time?  None that I was aware of.  There was one. I think she was in Willard. Deliria Robinson. She was a  black girl and I can   t remember where she was from. I think she also  went over to the Wesley Foundation with the Methodist group. But I  remember her being a very good ambassador for those of us that really  had never been around a black person before, at least not as an equal.  She was a delightful person. I remember one spring we wanted to go out  and lay in the sun to get a tan, and she went strutting around saying,     See my tan,    kind of thing. She was very at ease with us and put us at  ease with her, and so I credit her with a lot of breaking down some  barriers.  That   s very interesting.  What year was that?  Oh, golly, this may have been the first year.  I don   t remember anybody like that. In the band there was a black  student drummer, and he was the first black person I had ever known.  He called me one time on the hall phone and we visited and talked. He  said,    Is this embarrassing you for me to call you?    And I said,    No, I  enjoy talking to intelligent people,    and it wasn   t any further than that,  but I wasn   t comfortable. And I   ve been embarrassed about it ever since.  What, that you were embarrassed that you were uncomfortable?  Yes.  How interesting.  And, in the sociology department, I was told this by the full-time  secretary, I think it happened the year before. Four students came from  Ethiopia, we had a branch then, and when they arrived on campus, one  or more of the sociology professors took them to downtown Stillwater to  various businesses and said,    Now this is so-and-so and so-and-so. They  are Ethiopian students. They   re from Ethiopia; they   re not American  negroes. So, I hope that you will allow them to come to your shop.    And  it was closed other than that for black students.  Wow.  20  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  That blew me away.  That is interesting. Were you all active in Willard or OSU residence hall  associations? Did any of you hold a hall or floor position?  No.  And you said you worked in the sociology department. What was your  pay back then? I assume it was an hourly job.  I was paid by the month. I was paid  75 and room and board was   72.50. (Laughs) So, I had spending money of whatever that is.  I actually had a job in the dorm for awhile. I don   t remember how much  I was paid. I   m sure not very much, but it was running the elevator.  What elevator? In the dorm?  In the dorm. Yes, there was an old clunky elevator that had the mesh on  the doors, you know, that went shut and then you turned the lever.  Huh. Could students use it?  Yes.  I just remember trudging up those stairs. (Laughter)  Did we talk about a dress code? Did you all remember a dress code?  Oh, yes. Oh, my, yes. No pants.  No pants.  Except on Saturday.  Yes, Saturdays you could. But one very courageous student would wear  a long coat and wear pants under the long coat. She did.  Really?  Yes.  Was she ever caught?  Not to my knowledge. Margaret Black.  21  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Oh, okay.  She did that during the week but not during the weekend, is that what  you   re saying? Because she didn   t     She would wear that to class.  She was an architecture major, I think.  Wow. You know, you all have been together, or you   ve had these  reunions, now, going on for the last fifty years, which that says a lot  about you. It really is neat. Can you explain what has kept you all  together as a group of women that still want to stay in contact with each  other?  My take on it is that we were unique in that we had so many ties. A lot  of us were from small-town Oklahoma. A number of us were home ec  majors, not everybody, but some. Some were Methodists, not all, but  some. Some had known each other through 4-H when they were in high  school. So, there were a lot of ties from different directions that I think  made the difference.  Yes. If you weren   t tied one way, you were tied another. And there are  several really strong organizational kind of women that just would not  let it die. Marguerite and Virginia. Strong women.  How soon after you graduated did you start meeting?  It wasn   t very soon for me.  You say it wasn   t for you. So, some people got together, let   s say, soon  after and then somebody would call somebody and say,    Hey, we   re  meeting,    and then they would pick up somebody that hadn   t been for a  while. Because you   re going through different parts of your life, some  people raising their children and their obligations are different at  different times.  Yes.  And some people stayed around in the vicinity, whereas others, like me  and Kathy, split for all parts of the country. So, it was harder for me to  get back.  But in between those times, did you send Christmas cards, make phone  calls?  22  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Yes, particularly Christmas cards.  Cards.  That   s really neat. How many reunions have you participated in and  where were the ones you participated in?  Where was the one in eastern Oklahoma? Turner Lake?  Tenkiller. Was that it?  Tenkiller.  Okay, there was one in southeastern Oklahoma. There was one up at  Roman Nose.  Yes, I missed that one.  I did go to that one.  Somebody said Altus. Did they go down to   ?  Not that I know of. Oh, went to Lugert, yes, I can remember. Then there  was one in southern Colorado. So, three or four.  Yes, I   ve only been to two.  As you all know, Willard was converted to an administrative building.  Was that controversial for you when they made that change? Did that  bother you in any way?  No.  And do you know if the Women of Willard group participated in the  renovation plans of Willard? Did they lobby for maintaining the original  living room spaces on the first floor? Do you know anything about that?  Has anyone mentioned the plaque for Francita?  Yes, the room that was dedicated to her.  Can you tell us about that?  This was at a time that I was kind of out of it, but the person honored  was my best friend all through high school. We had been in school  together since we were in like second or third grade. And so     23  Ahrberg  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Wood  And she came up to school with you?  She went to OBU for two years and then transferred to Oklahoma State.  We lived together one year and then, did you live with her?  A semester.  Can you share some highlights of your life after leaving OSU and where  you are living now? Tell us what year you graduated, again, and     In 1959.  And your major was?  Home economics education. I went to work for Oklahoma Extension as  a 4-H agent in Pauls Valley, Oklahoma, and Mary Eva followed me  there. Then I went to Denver with a couple of gals, and they stayed in  Denver and I went to Oregon and lived out there for fourteen years, I  guess. Then I moved to Florida and lived there for eleven and finally  moved back to Denver. And that   s where I will die. (Laughs)  Okay, and Harriett, how about you?  Well, I graduated in    60 and, at that time, Littleton Schools in Colorado  sent representatives out to various schools to interview. One came here,  and I interviewed and signed a contract. And then I realized that one  previous roommate and another   anyway, there were two from  Oklahoma State living in Littleton. So, we roomed together and had a  great time. And then I was married, and I taught for twenty-five and a  half years, high school and middle school English. I don   t know,  highlights, having children, I suppose, and following them through their  activities. Skiing, my husband and I skied for years and that was really a  great experience. Those would be the main things.  Now, tell me again when you graduated and what was your major?  In    60. My major was language arts education.  Is there any particular professor on campus that you recall that really  stands out in your mind that may have influenced you? Or a particular  class that really, when you got out there in the big world, it helped you  along the way?  (Laughs) I   m not sure this is a help, but as a senior, I can   t remember  what the class was but I really didn   t like who was teaching it. And I  remember her telling me,    Kathleen, you just have too many interests,     24  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  as though that were bad, because I kind of flitted from one thing to  another. (Laughter) That   s really the only thing I remember.  That stuck with you the whole time.  Yes, it stuck with me.  Is there a favorite class in your major that you really enjoyed?  Oh, gosh, this may sound strange because the instructor was very  interesting, but it was the Science of Food Preparation taught by  Virginia Lippert. And she was a formidable instructor, but it was one of  the classes I remember most. It was just a very, very good class. And I  remember her saying, and I   ve repeated this a number of times, and it  was so out of character,    When you have a failure with a bread product,  serve it warm and no one will ever know the difference.     (Laughs) And, so, have you done that?  Oh, many times, (laughter) and I   ve advised others to do the same.  Okay, Harriett, what about you?  Oh, my, I really don   t   I don   t remember names. I remember an  education professor I had, and students were not very receptive to him.  He looked like a walrus. (Laughs) He just looked comical, but when I  started teaching, I realized that a lot of the things he said were true. He  advocated so much teaching. He would say,    Teach wholes. Go from  wholes to parts back to wholes.    So, it   s like you   d be thrown out on the  basketball court to play volleyball. You did the whole thing and then you  realized what you didn   t know, so you   d go back to the parts and learn  the parts. And then you   d go back to the whole and enjoy it.  Wow, what a unique way of saying that, though. That is really unique.  Yes, it was. He was very wise. I remember him. I don   t remember any  other instructors that I was just over the moon with, but as I say, I wasn   t  into studying very much. I just didn   t have much time to study.  Were you more social or was it your work?  Work, yes. I wasn   t all that social, but that   s the one that I remember.  Are there any OSU traditions that you remember? Maybe outside  Homecoming that   was there a Howdy Week or something that really  stood out that you all will always remember about OSU, a tradition?  25  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Well, I remember Howdy Week. We were just looking at pictures of  when we were celebrating, and we were all duded up with hats and  goofy cowboy stuff. And a picture was taken of three of us, Francita and  I and Mary Eva, and I had a cigar. (Laughter) And my dad looked at the  picture, I was showing him pictures, my dad looked at this picture and  he said,    Look at that. That girl in the middle has a cigar in her mouth      He didn   t even recognize me. (Laughs)  Fortunately.  Fortunately, yes. No, he wouldn   t have cared.  You were on campus, maybe, at the same time that they changed the  name from Oklahoma A M to OSU. How did the students react to that,  and how was your own reaction?  That was the year before I came, but you didn   t like it much, did you?  Well, I didn   t think so, but I don   t think we made any big deal of it.  I thought there were petitions and stuff.  Well, I don   t remember. Yes, it was remembering to say    Oklahoma  State    rather than    Oklahoma A M.     I think there were a lot that really thought the tradition was being  massacred, you know.  Is there anything that when you knew you were coming to this interview  that you thought you really wanted to say that I haven   t touched upon,  that you would like to get in this interview? Anything about the  friendships you   ve made or what OSU means to you as you   ve gone on  and left the state? Do you follow Cowboy football at all or anything like  that? Of course, you   re in the Big 12 at Colorado.  I do whenever they   re winning. (Laughter)  I just wondered if there   s anything, since you don   t live here in  Oklahoma any longer, what have you taken from this university that still  means something to you when you hear OSU on the news?  Well, I watch the wrestling records some because that sport, I just found,  calls on so much from the individual. You   re out there on your own with  no teammates to help you. So, I   ve followed that and been very proud of  that. As far as academics, I don   t, and in any other way, I don   t.  26  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Wood  Dolezalek  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Again, I think it   s the people, the friendships.  Have you been on other university campuses? Do you feel that with  other universities, or do you think OSU is special in that regard?  I haven   t been on other campuses to get acquainted. I remember a group  coming from OU for some meeting or other, and I knew one of them,  and they just seemed pretty snooty. (Laughter) I think students were  very warm and genuine, and, of course, maybe it   s different,  independents from sororities.  Yes, true. Yes.  I don   t know.  Well, I did a master   s at Oregon State University, and then taught part-time  for three years, I guess it was. And actually, truth be known, I   ve  stayed in closer contact with Oregon State than I have with Oklahoma  State. But I was at a different point in my life, and I was more a part of  the community there, the larger community, than I was here. So, I think  that made a difference, too.  Well, I just think it   s so unique and neat that after fifty years you still  gather. My hat is off to you for making that happen and being part of  that. I want to thank you both for coming and sharing your stories with  us here at OSU. And if you have anything else you   d like to add, this is  the time to do it.  I was wondering if OSU has co-ed dorms now.  Oh, yes.  Do they?  Oh, yes.  And I was thinking how totally different that is.  The whole concept, yes.  Yes, because if anybody had a brother helping them move in or  something you had to yell,    Man on two     And nobody in the rooms  and, oh, it was just such a separation and such a   I think that sexes are  so much closer now in friendship ways. My kids were, in high school,  and I think that   s a healthy thing. I do.  27  Ahrberg  Wood  Ahrberg  Dolezalek  Yes, well we   ve come a long way.  (Laughs) Yes.  Thank you all very much, I appreciate it.  Sure thing.  -------  -------
