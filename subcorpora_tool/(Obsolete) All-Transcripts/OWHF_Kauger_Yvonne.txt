 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Tuesday, May 12, 2009 and I   m in Oklahoma City,  Oklahoma interviewing Justice Yvonne Kauger. This interview is being  conducted as part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame Oral History Project. Justice Kauger was inducted into the  Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame in 2001. Thank you for joining us  today. Let   s begin by learning a little bit more about you. If you could  talk about where you grew up and a little bit about your early life.  I grew up in Colony, Oklahoma, the center of the universe with the red  dirt. I was a cotton picking cotton chopper for my early life. It   s like my  then representative when I was appointed to the court said,    There   s  nothing like the cotton patch to give you ambition.    And I think that that  has probably factored into the rest of my life. (Laughs)  I was a daddy   s girl, he took me with him everywhere he went,  including    which OSHA would die about now   he built a little box to  take me on his tractor when I was 18 months old. I was a basketball  player. I think there   s nothing that women can do to prepare them for a  career that would help more than team sports. I think that   s really critical  to know that there   s a game going on, there are rules to the game, and  you need to know how to do it because we can   t do this by ourselves.  I lived in El Reno for a little while, while Daddy was in the Army     before he went to the Army. And that was good but I was glad to get  back to Colony and ride my horses and drive a tractor. I   ve been driving  since I was 11 or 12, first on a tractor. I do know how to handle a stick  shift, so that   s also good. All experiences are good I think.  I went to Southwestern  Southwestern Oklahoma State University  and  graduated in three years. I was a med tech before I was a lawyer. I  worked at Medical Arts Lab after I graduated from the internship  program at Saint Anthony  Hospital . I worked at Medical Arts Lab,  5  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  went to law school, so I guess that   s a pretty brief synopsis. I was in the  body business before I was a lawyer.  Well back on the farm growing up, did you have specific chores that you  had to do?  Oh yes, yes. I   ve done everything. I   ve mowed hay, I drove the tractor to  bale the hay, to load the hay. I   ve collected eggs from hens that wouldn   t  stay in the hen house   I did not appreciate looking for eggs in the bales  of hay. I   ve milked cows and done the separator and you know it   s a  wonder that any of us would eat anything or drink anything at that time.  It   s so much more sophisticated. We certainly didn   t clean the cow   s  bags before we milked them, we   d just milk them and that tail went in  the bucket about half the time, then they   d kick over the bucket. I was  not a very good milker, did not enjoy it either.  Did you have a favorite duty?  I suppose going to get the cows. Riding my horse to go get the cows was  probably the most fun.  Now the schools you attended, elementary school, junior high, were they  large schools or small schools?  Oh no, no. Well I went to kindergarten in Tulsa for maybe six months or  so. Started first grade in El Reno, had great teachers. Then in the  probably 3rd and 4th grades I was back at Colony   also really good  teachers, but very small. My graduating class had seven people in it.  And they always introduced me,    She was valedictorian of her high  school graduating class.    And I always feel I have to do a disclaimer,     Yes, I was co-valedictorian and there were seven in my class.     Well did you have favorite subjects during those years?  I liked history the best but I was a biology major in college. Biology  major, chemistry minor, and an English minor, I liked that too. And if I  had it to do over, I wouldn   t do any of those chemistry courses I don   t  think. (Laughs)  When you were growing up, what did you want to be?  A lawyer.  And how did you know?  When I got my driver   s license, that summer I met a lawyer from  6  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Cordell that had been my mother   s high school classmate. He had been  the county attorney and he was now in private practice, a very small  practice, solo practitioner. His wife was his legal secretary and she  wanted a break. Well I have had short-hand by now and typing and I can  drive, so he hired me to work during summer   cotton picking vacation   And the lawyer down the hall from me, J.T. Bailey, came down and   I  actually took a trial, I didn   t have to transcribe it fortunately. J.T. was  very impressed and he said,    Honey, it   s just so good that you can do  this and you just ought to go to law school.    And I thought,    Yes, I  should.    But I had to have a trade to pay my way, so that   s why I  became a med tech first so I could fund it.  And you went to college at?  Southwestern.  And why did you choose Southwestern?  It was close, it was 15 miles from home and they gave me a tuition  scholarship for being valedictorian of my class. (Laughs)  There was a benefit.  Yes. And they renewed it if you maintained I think a B average maybe.  Did you enjoy college?  I had a good time, I did. I worked as secretary for the head of the  chemistry department. See, all these skills come into play. And I enjoyed  them, made lifelong friends.  But all along you knew     Yes, that I really wanted to be a lawyer. And I didn   t know any women  lawyers. The only woman lawyer I knew was in that radio soap opera  Portia Faces Life, she was a lawyer.  And was your family very supportive of your career choice?  Oh my daddy always told me I could do anything I wanted to do and be  anything I wanted to be. And my mother always said I better do it right.  Like I said, I was a daddy   s girl and he thought I could just do anything.  My great grandfather was an immigrant from Russia. The family had  gone to Russia when Catherine the Great gave the German farmers land.  And then Fred left when they started taking the land away, Uncle David  had been a judge in Russia. So that was the last lawyer in the family  7  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  before me.  So after college, take me through what happens next.  I worked for Medical Arts lab for let   s see, five years and then I started  law school. My daughter learned to write her name on my first set of law  school finals. I had a good time in law school; I   ve never seen so many  movies. I think law school   s much harder now. But I ended up at the end  of the first semester second in my class. And I hadn   t really just devoted  every minute to it. I thought,    You know if I really apply myself I could  probably be first in this class.    Gary Richardson, who ran for governor,  was in my class for that first semester and he left and went off to Texas  to finish law school and I was so glad, I thought,    Well there, all I have  to do is maintain the course now.    (Laughs) I was very glad he left.  Was it tough being a woman back in the    60s in law school?  No. I   d like to say,    Oh it was horrible,    but it wasn   t horrible at all. And  I   ve said this before, I   ve never had discrimination, which is also sort of  interesting. When I was a med tech, that   s a woman   s field. I was hired  the first day I went to my internship by Dr. Rex Kinyon too. I   ve never  applied for a job until I applied for the Supreme Court. So I was in law  school, they might   ve thought they were discriminatory but they really  weren   t. I started in    65 and most of the classes before had one or two  women. In my class, they had admitted twelve women and they called us  the Petticoat Class   now see, that sounds pretty bad, but it wasn   t really  bad. Because when the class of    69 graduated from law school, the top  three men in the class were women.  At that time, they weren   t hiring women lawyers but Cleeta John  Rogers, Senator Cleeta John Rogers was a good friend of one of my  professors and he kept asking me to come to work for him. I was asked  by Judge A.P. Murrah of the Murrah Building to be his law clerk and I  couldn   t do it because I had this little girl, I couldn   t go to Denver and  do those sorts of things. G.T. Blankenship offered me a job as member  of his staff in the Attorney General   s office. So I had lots of job offers,  but it wasn   t the same. I mean there are horror stories, Justice Ginsburg  could only get a job as a secretary and the same thing with Justice  O   Connor, it just hasn   t happened to me.  This same lawyer that worked down the hall that told me I should go to  law school, then when I graduated from law school, he told me while I  was in law school he was just so proud, and then when I graduated he  said,    Now listen honey, those jobs out at the Supreme Court, you ought  to get one of those clerk jobs.    And I thought that sounded really good  but there had never been a woman as a staff lawyer. But I had met  8  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Justice Hodges my first semester in law school at a function at the  Beacon Club that the law school hosted for some students and the  Supreme Court and we became friends. After I   d been in private practice  with Senator Rogers for awhile, two and a half years, Justice Hodges  came and asked me to come and work for him and said,    You know,  I   ve had the worst luck with my staff. One got a brain tumor, one was in  a car wreck, one had a motorcycle accident, and I don   t know if it   s safe  to work for me. But if you would like to try it, I would like to give you  the job.    I worked with him for eleven and a half years before I was  appointed to the Supreme Court.  What a great opportunity.  Yes, I owe him my career. He is a wonderful man.  Did you ever think that you would be sitting here today after serving as  a clerk?  I thought it was possible. But then Alma Wilson was appointed and I  thought,    I don   t believe the Governor would  appoint  two women in a  row.    And there wasn   t an opening   your chances of being on the  Supreme Court, and I knew that, were about the same as your chances of  being struck by lightning. You have to be from the right district, there  has to be a vacancy   the odds are just so improbable that you   re going  to be appointed to any judgeship. So I thought after Alma was appointed  that probably I would not. But then Justice Irwin from my district  resigned to become a federal magistrate, he could retire here and get a  federal job with a salary and eventually a federal pension. And I was so  comfortable with my life, I thought,    Do I really want to do this?    It was  in the middle of winter and I had a diesel car that didn   t always start  when it was very cold and I went out to the parking lot and I had an  appointment to meet with someone about it. I thought,    This will be a  sign. If this car won   t start, then I   m just not   you know I   m quilting,  I   m happy, everything   s great,    and I pulled out that glow plug and it  just started right off the bat. (Laughs) So I went on with it.  Do you remember the first time you met Governor Nigh?  Yes. I did not know Governor Nigh. I had not met Governor Nigh at all  until after I applied for the Court. And then I met him in the cafeteria     we used to have a cafeteria here and I met him in the cafeteria and he  registered absolutely no recognition of my name at all. But I think  behind the scenes Donna  Governor Nigh   s wife  was very busy. And so  one of my friends, a district judge came up to me and said,    Hey kid,  you aren   t going to get it.    I said,    Oh well really Judge, why not?    And  he said,    The governor   s already had his woman and you   re just not  9  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  going to get it.    I had on my power shoes, and I patted him on the  shoulder and I said,    Well Judge, you know sometimes the best man for  a job is a wo-man.    Governor Nigh thought so too and he appointed two  women in a row. And then the vacancy came up for the position that  Hardy Summers filled and Hardy was terrified; he said that he heard that  the governor had said he really liked those women and he thought  maybe he   d just keep right on appointing those women to the Supreme  Court. And Hardy lived in mortal fear until he found that no woman had  applied for his position.  So after you were appointed, how did you feel? What was going through  your mind?  Well, ecstatic. Three feet off the ground and I still feel that way, it   s the  same way every day. It   s the perfect job. Not very many people really  get to get the job they   ve always wanted and I   ve never wanted another  one. The one I had before was the perfect job, I loved it, I would   ve  done that forever. This is better though, you get the vote.  So to track back just a second, can you go through the application  process?  Well, you have to be from one of the nine judicial districts, you have to  be 35 years old, you have to have been a lawyer five years. Then you  have to make your application to the judicial nominating commission. It  is comprised of six lawyers elected by the Oklahoma Bar Association  from the six congressional districts   even though we now have five,  they still have maintained the six lawyers. There are six members who  are civilians that are appointed by the governor; three republicans, three  democrats so that it has a balance. Then they elect the thirteenth  member, the swing vote, the twelve do. You file your application and the  OSBI goes out and investigates you, they go out and talk to your  neighbors and the ones you   ve practiced with. I told Governor Nigh at  the time,    It   s sort of like dying and going to heaven. You have to go  through the judgment to see how things turned out.    Then the  commission sends up to three names, to the governor who selects one of  them.  And do you know who the three names are?  Oh yes. And it   s interesting, the higher up the food chain you go, the  more I hesitate to say prestigious, but the more responsible maybe. The  Supreme Court has fewer applicants than a district judgeship will have.  The scrutiny is really pretty intense and it   s amazing for some of the  judgeships that people will apply who should know they should not  because they   re going to be investigated. (Laughs) But you do know,  10  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  there   s a list published of all the applicants and then there   s a list of the  three that are sent to the governor.  And you   ve been doing this for quite some time.  This is my 25th year. I have been at the Court since September 6, 1972  when I came to work for Justice Hodges. And we do everything here by  seniority, we park by seniority, we vote by seniority. I have this office  because I   m now number three and numbers one and two did not want to  move. But Kyle Shifflett, my staff lawyer and Vanessa Traylor wanted  to move so we moved and I   m really glad we did. I have the nicest office  here. This used to be the Chief Justice   s office 30 years ago before we  moved it. But I think that   s one reason Justice Lavender, who had this  office for many years, did not serve his second term as Chief Justice,  because he didn   t want to move out of this office. (Laughs) It connects  with our conference room and you can have your whole staff with you.  I   ve been working over 30 years to get the new court building, which  we   re going to move to I hope a year from July now. We   ll have very  nice offices there. Here, we can   t keep our staff with us other than this  office and the Chief   s office. There   s not room for a second lawyer to be  with us, and that   s really a detriment not to be able to call them in and  work with them.  I   m from Florida and we have a separate Supreme Court building in  Tallahassee, so when I came to Oklahoma and saw it was in the Capitol  I thought that was interesting.  Well it   s going to be different though, we   re working on it.  And where will the new location be?  Just right across the way, the old Wiley Post Historical Society building.  So describe for me a typical day.  Well, there is no typical day. There truly isn   t. And it depends on  whether I   m sitting in this office or whether I   m sitting in the Chief   s  office. A typical day, a Monday   my office comes to work early, we are  the earliest office here. Everyone   s here usually before eight. I have now  moved, I   m right across the street and I   ve built a new house, which is  right across the street from what will be our new court building so my  commute is now two minutes. And I have found, the closer I am, that I  don   t make it quite by eight, like I used to be early. (Laughs) At nine  o   clock, we have our conference, although it   s turned out lately that  most of us are in there by 8:45. We do our Certiorari cases from the  Court of Appeals that people are not happy with the result, asking us to  11  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  take another look and write an opinion and reverse them. We do our  original proceedings, which is our Writ Docket, and we do our Motion  Dockets on Mondays. So that usually takes care of Monday morning  pretty much. Then, they   ve already circulated the docket for the next  Monday so you   re always behind. Then we have a Thursday docket,  which are our opinions. We hand down our opinions on Tuesdays,  supposedly before noon but you can get them on the website. I   m very  proud of our website that was started when I was in the Chief Justice   s  office. It   s been a great service I think that our cases are up and they   re  free; lawyers really appreciate it, as do judges and ordinary people.  So what are some differences between Justice Kauger and Chief Justice  Kauger?  Chief Justice is so much harder. You never know what   s going to  happen and the phone rings constantly and there   s always a fire to put  out. Someone   s air conditioner quits working at one of the court  houses   we have general superintending control of all the courts and so  we control all the budgets of all the courts, except for the Court of  Criminal Appeals, who now has their own separate budget. But all the  district courts, we have all that administrative work and that really falls  on the Chief Justice. So there   s a lot more to do. Being a Justice is, well  it   s hard work, but it   s not nearly as hard as being Chief Justice. So then  you prepare, Thursday we have our other docket and then you start again  because Wednesday you   ve circulated for the next Thursday. There are  things that you just don   t know are going to happen. I have a building  committee meeting on Thursday this week because I   m chair of the  building committee.  My daughter is having her Early American Glass Club luncheon on  Wednesday, which is an annual event and it is her favorite club. And my  good friend Lou Kerr, when Jonna got in it said,    Who died?    because  it   s generally women of more maturity, but she loves it and so I   m going  to that. You know, that   s one of the things you have to go to tomorrow,  the Glass Club Luncheon. So you never know. We   re putting on the  Sovereignty Symposium right now, June 2nd and 3rd, which is the largest  Indian Law seminar in the United States, so that   s done out of my office  with Julie Rorie and all of my staff is involved in that. This year it   s T.  Boone Pickens, we   re doing    Land, Wind, and Water.    I   ll have to make  sure you get a poster. Our posters are done by Mike Larsen who did the  mural of ballerinas in the Capitol There are two Mike Larsen paintings  in my office. So we   re very fortunate to have them; I like the arts. I won  the Governor   s Arts Award and   I bought a great painting this weekend  that I just am so excited still. So that   s pretty much   you really don   t  know what   s coming in. Some things you can figure out, but see like you  today, never sure.  12  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  On average, how many cases come through your office every year?  I really don   t know, haven   t thought about that. Our Monday dockets,  which we have to prepare for, have anywhere from 15 to sometimes 30  cases. The Thursdays are not so many cases but the work is harder  because mostly we write first impression cases and so that requires a lot  more research. So we look at probably from 500 to 750 cases a year,  which you know, the work is tall. (Laughs) You need to be a speed  reader.  And there   s no off time, it   s twelve months a year?  We have time off, we take some time off in the summer where we don   t  have regularly scheduled conferences but we   re always, we   re here, no  one takes much time off because it   s a nice time to be able to get ready if  you   ve got   I   m so compulsive, I try not to have anything that   s old.  But in case you do, that gives you some time to get caught up.  We learn the background we need for our career in many different  places, sometimes school, sometimes it   s on the job. Where do you think  you learned the background you needed to be sitting here today?  Well I had truly on-the-job training with Justice Hodges. I think it   s  important to be a list-maker, that   s my mother probably. But I had a  really great opportunity to have worked with him and to learn   I  thought, in fact I really thought I knew how to do it all until I went to my  first conference and found out that when he left on Mondays and  Thursdays, he was really doing a lot more than I thought he was.  Because that is where we do our most intense work, it   s give and take,  it   s hammering things out, it   s being ready, a lot of discussion   that   s  the most valuable thing we do, because we come from nine different  districts and you get that input from nine separate people and I think we  have a much better product that way. So I didn   t know nearly as much as  I thought I knew.  You mentioned while you were Chief Justice that you helped bring the  online cases to the forefront. Any other key or notable achievements?  Not only as Chief Justice, but during your time on the Supreme Court  that you can recall?  Well, I   ve been the chair of the building committee forever and when I  was Chief I spoke to the legislature and asked them for the building. I  also asked for the History Center, because they   ve been my board, I  swear in that board, and I would tell them every time I went over to  swear them in that I wanted their building. I told the legislature I wanted  their building and I wanted them to have a new one. And Stratton Taylor  13  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  said to me,    You know Yvonne, normally you don   t ask for someone  else   s project, people just ask for their own. But I think this is going to  work out.    So I have worked really hard on that.  The Sovereignty Symposium I have coordinated since its inception, this  will be our 22nd year. We did it because John Doolin kept going to the  National Association of Chief Justices and they have an Indian law  committee, but he went three times and came back and said,    They   re  never going to do anything. They talk about it, they say they   re going to  have a seminar, they say they   re going to do this. They haven   t done  anything and they   re not going to do anything.    And they still haven   t.  So he said,    We   ll just do our own.    So Governor Bellmon was very  instrumental in helping us, and Ed Edmondson, and we did it. And now  we   ve been doing   and no one gets anything for doing this, they pay  their own way. We have the best legal scholars in the world and they pay  their own way and they get a T-shirt for coming and our thanks.  How long has it been going on?  Twenty-two years.  That   s a long time. That   s a good tribute to law and education.  And I   m very proud of Red Earth, which was really my idea so   mine  and Ken, you know I talked to Ken Bonds, the co-founder and that   ll be  23 years and we very carefully have this symposium so that Red Earth  follows right along because people want to come and go to Red Earth  and that way they   ll come here.  So tell me what happens at Red Earth?  Lots of dancing, lots of eating, lots of art. Great art. We have the best  artists here and they were not being appreciated and they were frozen  out of the Indian market in Santa Fe. That   s no longer the case at all.  Ben Harjo, one of the first artists at Red Earth was featured I think it was  four years ago, and our artists win major, major medals there all the  time.  And you   re considered the mother of Red Earth.  Yes. Very proud of that.  Do you do much dancing yourself?  Well, the first year Allie Reynolds was my hero, the super chief from the  Yankees, and he was so instrumental in giving it credibility because at  14  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  so many pow-wows people would advertise prize money then not pay.  And Allie stood there and paid everyone, handed the winners a check.  But we danced the first Grand Entry and I said,    Look at this, Allie, look  at this. Isn   t this just great? It   s just great.    He said,    My knees are  killing me.    And I   m saying,    Oh this is great, this is great.    And I   m  dancing in my moccasins the first one, and I danced every one that year;  I had shin splints after it was over  (Laughs) So now I don   t dance in  moccasins on that concrete floor. But I actually carried my grandson Jay  for one Grand Entry and he was a pretty chunky little fellow. I guess he  was walking, but he couldn   t have done all that. So it   s great, I grew up  to the sound of the drum and I need it. I have a friend who   s a Buddhist  and sometimes when they   re having a drumming ceremony I go there  because if I haven   t been home or to a pow-wow, I need to hear that  drum. It just does something for you.  You have a very strong Native American connection. You were adopted  by the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes. Can you talk a little bit about that  for me, how that came about?  Well, my great-grandfather hired the Cheyenne women to be the nannies  for my daddy. His mother died when he was six months old, so Fred was  very close to the Cheyenne Arapaho people and hired Howling Man  Woman, who is Reba Cross Solomon   s (who was one of the artists at  Red Earth) great-grandmother. She actually found a photograph when  she cleaned out her grandmother   s things that had my daddy on the back  of her great-grandmother   s photograph and it said    Kauger Baby.     Brenda Kennedy did a wonderful painting from that for me. So Fred  hired the Cheyenne women to be the nannies and then Daddy was just  always close to them. Colony is the oldest town in western Oklahoma  and it was created by John Seeger for an Indian school, the first  vocational agricultural school in the United States, not college but  school, to domesticate the tribes. And they rounded up the little children  and cut off their braids and took their clothes and sent them to boarding  school and washed out their mouths with soap if they spoke their native  language.  My daddy and Archer Black Owl were very close, the Cheyenne child  that was the grandson of Chief Roman Nose and so Daddy was close  always. He went away to war and when they came back they had a  victory dance and Daddy danced and the ladies said,    Oh look at  Johnny, he can still dance.    And he could, they honored him several  times at the Colony pow-wow. So even though we have no Indian blood,  I had that great affection because he did. This year   s honored one at Red  Earth is Jerry  Jereldine  Cross Redcorn. We played basketball together  and now she   s turned out to be the pre-eminent Caddo potter. Barack  Obama has chosen one of her pots from the Museum of the American  15  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Indian to go in his office along with Maria Martinez and Lucy Lewis. So  that   s pretty good for two girls from Colony, population 201 or  whatever. (Laughs)  So how does one become adopted? Do they just say,    You   re one of us  now?     Well, when I was appointed to the court, I had this gallery in Colony     this was before Red Earth. Charles Jones who did the interview asked  me about it and the tribe and I said I   d always wanted to be an Indian.  And then Chief Big Snake, when that article was published, called from  the Native American Center and said,    Yvonne, the phone is ringing off  the wall here.    He said,    Every tribe in the state wants to adopt you, but  I have told them you belong to the Cheyenne-Arapaho because you grew  up with them.    So he sort of foisted it on them I guess. But I would go to  the pow-wow grounds, when I was a little girl Chief Annita Washee was  sitting out in front of the paint store with his braids and ribbons, I mean  there was so much history there if I   d only known. I mean it   s not that  long that these men, they knew so much. But it was a really remarkable  experience.  My mother though would retrieve me from the pow-wow grounds  because I would be down there and I   I am a terrible dancer, I never  have learned truly to dance anything very well. And so when they did  the adoption, it involves a dance. And she said to me,    I don   t  understand why you want to be adopted, you have two perfectly good  parents.    Daddy understood. And you know you have to buy a beef and  you give away shawls and things and he told me,    Well in the old days  Fred would   ve given them three beefs instead of one.    But we did it and  Daddy was very proud. And so was Mother. And they went out and they  were honored and then I went over to her after it was over and said,     Well, Mother what did you think?    and she said,    You still haven   t  learned to dance.    (Laughs) Which was pretty true. But they brought the  sacred dirt from Bear Butte and it was very impressive to be painted.  Well you   ve made mention of the Gallery of the Plains Indians, how did  that come about?  Well it was on the road to Taos; it was kind of like Paul on the road to  Damascus and it occurred to me I had always wanted to have a gallery in  Santa Fe but I knew I was never going to get the money to do a gallery  in Santa Fe, but my great-grandfather had built the old post office  building in Colony. It   s a little stucco building and it looks like either a  jail or a Santa Fe gallery. And it occurred to me,    Well I can put it in  there.    At the time Daddy was getting  10 a month from Payne   s store  for them to store their feed over there and it was pretty decrepit. So I  16  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  conceived the idea of having this gallery and having Archie Black Owl,  this little boy that Daddy had thrown rocks at back and forth, they had  engaged at rock fights when Archie was at the Indian school, who turned  out to be a very   that   s a Archie Black Owl  painting  right there.  That   s a Dick West over there, Dr. Dick West who is a contemporary of  Archie   s, both of them were Cheyenne masters and hang in museums all  over the world. So I thought I had to get Archie before he died because I  knew he was older than Daddy. So I finally tracked him down and wrote  him a letter. He went to see Daddy and Mother and said he had this letter  and he would be willing to meet with me about it. Well they hadn   t  really decided to give me that building yet, but I was proceeding  onward. I knew Daddy would give it to me, it was his, I knew he   d give  it to me because he couldn   t really deny me anything.  Archie showed up and Daddy called and said,    Well Archie   s here,    so I  arranged to meet at another time to go out to Colony and he said to me     you see, I thought that I have to get him before he   s gone, and he says to  me,    I got your letter and it bothered me. So I spoke to my mother.    And  here she is, she   s 98 years old and still   so it worked out. (Laughs) So  we did it that Labor Day. But it was because there was not a market for  our artists, they were being shut out of Santa Fe and I thought,    Well I  can make a little step here at the center of the universe in Colony and see  what happens.    So the first year, people came from Egypt even. Rotary  Clubs had exchange people and they brought them out because it   s done  in connection with the pow-wow on Labor Day weekend. And then that  was the genesis for Red Earth, that combination of art and the dance. So  now I   ve given it to Southwestern State University. I gave them the three  buildings left on Main Street four years ago I think.  And that   s just a great way to preserve it and keep it up.  Yes. You know I couldn   t keep it up forever. So I   m hopeful. They got  an ICETEA grant and I   m hopeful they   re going to get things going  again.  I was reading that you have the nickname of Zorro     Yes.  Tell me how you received this nickname.  Well, Justice Don Barnes gave it to me. Former Chief Justice Don  Barnes, a great family friend. He had given me the name when I was a  staff lawyer. He said,    She   s so good she can just cut through these  complex issues, just like Zorro with a sword.    So he called me Zorro and  I kind of liked it. When Bruce emailed from England right before my  17  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  oldest grandson was born, he emailed and said,    We have decided what  we are going to call the baby. And now I   m deciding what he will call  the grandparents,    of which there were many. Jay was the first great-grandchild  on both sides of the family. His great-grandmother on  Bruce   s side lived in Holland and did not speak English. His mother had  lived in England for years, but still has a very strong accent. The dad is  British with a touch of Australian. And then my mother, we   re Okies,  you know. So Bruce went down the litany saying,    Well of course my  mother will be called Oma, because she   s Dutch and that   s the  traditional name. And grandmother will be called Grandmother because  that   s what Jonna calls her.    And he said,    I have decided you will be  called Grandmother Justice.    I emailed back,    Bruce you have a lot to  learn.    These babies will call you what they want to call you, when they  can call you. But in the interim, I don   t intend to be called anything that  sounds like a legal treatise. And until he decides what to call me, he can  just call me by my real name, Zorro.    Well Jonna thought it was  hilarious and Jay was still in England at the time. They moved here  when he was ten months old. But you know, I   d hold him and that little  child never touched a bed until he was two years old I don   t think, he  was held constantly, because he is this only grandchild. And I would say  to him,    I   m your grand mommy but you can call me anything you want  to.    And when he finally said my name, it was    Orro.    (Laughter) So  that   s what it   s been. Although Winston, my little guy who   s eight told  me not too long ago he rather liked Grandmother Justice, he might try  that. He   s very formal, very formal.  Well that   s good. Can you go into a couple of key moments in your life  that you consider highlights above all else?  No, no, not above all else. (Laughter) I can give you some highlights.  Hitting 32 out of 37 free shots in the finals of a tournament, that was  pretty big. They were betting on me in the stands.  Who were you playing?  I was playing for Colony High School. We were at Weatherford in the  college gym and we won the whatever tournament it was, Southwestern  Invitational probably. That was big. Being hired by Justice Hodges, that  was big. Having a girl, which I wanted   in those days you didn   t know  what you were having, no ultrasounds. My gynecologist/obstetrician, Dr.  George Jennings, who was married to my cousin Wanda, predicted it  was a boy based on the heart rate. They gave me scopolamine, which  they don   t do any more either, and I didn   t really care if I had clothes on,  I got up and walked around, I went into the bathroom. He said,    You  can   t do that.    Well why not?    Well you might have the baby in the  toilet,    and I said,    Oh, should I be so lucky?     (Laughs) But I went to  18  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  sleep and I woke up and I   d told him,    I want a girl, I   m only having a  girl.    I woke up and he was in checking on me and I said to him,    Well  it was a girl, wasn   t it?    And he said,    I don   t know, you haven   t had the  baby yet.    (Laughs) So having a girl was a pretty big deal. Certainly  being appointed to the Court, when I found out that I was appointed to  the Court and Jeanette Edmondson, who was a great supporter of  women, she was one of my heroes and she was Secretary of State at the  time. She called me and told me,    Yvonne, I   ve just signed your  Certificate of Appointment.    I said,    But Jeanette, the Governor hasn   t  called me yet.    She said,    I don   t care. He signed it, I signed it, I   ve filed  it, you   re it.    So that was big and calling my dad, who was in the  hospital visiting my Uncle Herman, and calling him and telling him that  I   d been appointed. And that   s what I told him,    Daddy, I can still hit the  long shot.    Because I certainly was   no one thought I would be  appointed. After that, hearing my grandson sing   he has an incredible  voice. I am not moved to tears easily, but he can do that. I don   t know.  Lots of occasions.  Well, turning to the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame, when you were  notified that you were going to be inducted, what were you thinking?  What was going through your mind? 2001 wasn   t that long ago.  It wasn   t that long ago. I was very pleased. Jack Bonny had called and  asked if he could nominate me and it was nice. You   re stunned when  you look at the list of the women that are in, and then I   m also stunned  when I look at the list of women that ought to be in, like I told you about  Judge Carol Hansen, who certainly should be a member.  And did you attend the ceremony?  Oh yes, absolutely. It was very difficult for me because one of my really  good friends, Kay Terrill, had died and her funeral was at exactly the  same time. And it was really   but I talked to Al and it was okay with  him. That, you know, made it a bittersweet day.  And do you remember who presented you?  Yes, the person who nominated me, my Representative Jack Bonny.  You   ve received many honors from many different organizations  throughout the years. What does this particular honor mean to you?  Well, it   s really important because you   re recognized by your peers. I  understand that the process is pretty excruciating and they   re very  discriminating. So it is a recognition for your work.  19  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  And how do you feel that now women look to you as a role model?  I didn   t realize that for a while. But it came to me really pretty early  after I was appointed to the Court because Senator Kelly Haney brought  some fourth grade girls over to take a tour of the Court. He asked me if  I   d do the tour of the Court and I said,    Of course.    I think we have the  most beautiful courtroom in the state, and our courtroom is certainly  much more attractive than the United States Supreme Courtroom. Ours  is light and beautiful. And as Jonna says,    When the children come,  always tell them be sure and look at the ceiling because it looks like  wedding cake,    and it really does. So I told those little girls that. And  then they asked if they could touch me. And that   s when it hit, I better  do this right because these little girls are looking up to me and asking if  they can touch me.  Did you let them touch you?  Oh sure. (Laughter)  That   s great. Well you   ve made mention of lots of people who have had  a major impact in your life. Is there anybody else you   d like to make  mention of?  Doyle Ward, who was my high school English teacher who taught me  how to write. And Dr. Gladys Bellamy, who did the same thing at  Southwestern. Dr. Donald Hamm, who was my chemistry professor and  made chemistry at least tolerable; it   s not very interesting, I mean even  though you have to have it. I   ve talked to you about Rex Kenyon who  hired me the first day and Cleeta John Rogers who also came looking for  me. And Ralph Hodges.  I think one of the things we need to recognize, at least in my career, was  that there was no one   perhaps because it was the situation   but there  was no one who helped me more get to where I am then    daddies with  daughters.    They may have been willing for their wives to have doors  shut in their faces, but not for their daughters. And so no one helped me  more than daddies with daughters in getting to this position. Even  Governor Nigh has a daughter. My mother was certainly critical and she  was a beautiful and talented woman in her own right and I don   t think  she   s made me too compulsive, but I am really you know. I   m like  Monk. If I see a crooked picture... (Laughs) You know, doing it right  can be taken to extreme, but I don   t regret it. I am a perfectionist and  that   s okay.  Absolutely.  20  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  And my Aunt Lucille was my role model, I left her out. My Aunt Lucille  Simmons, Aunt Lucille Bottom Simmons was the first woman county  superintendent of schools in Canadian County, she was the first woman  principal as far as I know in Washita County and was principal at my  grade school. She retired from being an Oklahoma school teacher and at  65 she learned to ride a bicycle and to speak Swahili and served two  terms in the Peace Corps in Kenya and Tanzania. She later married at  85, for the second time, and was happier than she had ever been in her  life until she died at 95 or 6. So she is my role model.  Wow. You may not have had a lot of women lawyers to look up to, but  you sure had a great support system around you and lots of great people  to look up to from within your family and from outside.  Yes.  Well what does Oklahoma mean to you?  It   s the center of the universe. I tell them that. Colony is the absolute  center, you know we   re practically equidistant between Moscow and  Tokyo and I don   t understand why we aren   t a hub for transportation, it  doesn   t make sense to me. I really want the train back so much. But  Oklahoma   s people, Jonna, my daughter is general counsel for the  Commerce Department and deputy director. She came back here when  Jay was ten months old. She practiced law in London, she is a British  solicitor as well as an Oklahoma lawyer and is licensed in Washington,  D.C., Massachusetts, England, Scotland, and Wales. She came back and  her friends could not believe it. She was in this very prestigious law firm  in London, Boodle and Hatfield. One of the Boodles made gin and the  other established the law firm in the 1700s and she said the gin still  flowed like water at the company parties. (Laughs) But she travelled, she  went to South Africa, she went to Hong Kong, she went to Indonesia  representing her clients, and so when she came back here, her friends  said,    We just can   t understand why you would do that, you know here  you are in London.    She said,    Well I wanted to go home.    And after the  bombing they called her from literally all over the world and said,    We  understand now, we understand why you went home, it   s your people.     And we have the best people in the world here.  Well if you could give any advice to your fellow Oklahomans, what  would you tell them?  Be proud of being an Okie. I   m in a history book about that, page 19 or  20 or 21, I   m an Okie and I   m proud of it. We have everything here. We  have very interesting weather, we have our topography. I can let you out  in southeastern Oklahoma and tell you,    You   re in Vermont    and you  21  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  would believe it. So I think we need to have more pride in what we do  and what we are. That   s what I would say. You know I believe in trying  to brighten the corner where you are and we ought to do more of that  instead of putting ourselves down. Because I   ve told Jonna and my  grandsons that no matter what happens, there   s an Okie in the middle of  it. If they catch a spy, we either caught him or the spy had some  connection. You know, we   ve got oil and gas that permeates the whole  world in the way that we handle our business. It   s unusual stock here  that can do anything.  And for women who are in school right now or who may not be in school  right now and they look to become a justice on their State Supreme  Court, what would you tell them?  Do something you really like. I love my job, I loved working for Justice  Hodges, I would   ve been content with that. I did not like driving a  tractor, I did not like pulling cotton. I did student teaching   that   s the  other thing I   d tell them, I try to protect my backside three deep. You  know, if you don   t like this one, you need to have some backups so you  don   t start over. So I took all those boring, to me, teacher education  courses because   and I did the student teaching and had a teacher   s  certificate. I liked being a med tech. I never wanted to be a doctor,  because I wanted to go to law school, I knew that. But do something you  really enjoy so that   I mean in this time it seems like people have to  change jobs more often, but it ought to be something you like doing, you  ought not to hate to go to work in the morning.  Well, when history is written about you, what would you like for it to  say?  She did her best.  And is there anything else that we haven   t touched upon today that you  would like to add?  That I have the most marvelous grandchildren ever born in this universe.  They are the light of my life, they are incredible; Jay and Winston are  children of great joy. And I realized this when I became a grandparent,  that while you   re too busy with your children to maybe do all the things  that you ought to do or would like to do, with grandchildren you can  make the memories you want them to have. And I try to do that. I   ve  taken them to Washington, D.C. I said,    What do you guys want to go  and do when we go to Washington, D.C.?    Jay said well he didn   t know  for sure, maybe he   d like to shop a little. And Winston said, who is the  younger,    I want to see the Declaration of Independence and secure a  copy thereof.    And so we went to the National Archives and did so. So  22  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  Nykolaiszyn  Kauger  those are things you can feel good about, that you can make those  memories that you would like them to have.  Well what   s next on the agenda for you?  Sovereignty Symposium   s the third and fourth of June so that   s  immediate, I mean it   s almost crisis time; that   s what   s next.  And looking forward into the future, retirement?  No, not as long   I still feel on top of my game and I love what I do. I  mean most of the Court could retire now. Justice Opala is 88, he   s been  here not quite as long as Justice Hargrave who celebrated his 30th year. I  think everyone could retire but maybe two of us now at full retirement.  But it is a wonderful thing, I love the job, I love my staff and my  colleagues. I have the best staff in the world, they   ve been with me for  more than 16 years and they are Kyle Shiftlet and Vanessa Traylor are  wonderful. Now we have George to do the stuff that we don   t want to  do, George Wright. Kyle and I don   t particularly like the computer stuff  and George is very good at it so he   s filling in that necessary spot. So I  don   t think so, it   s just fun to come to work every day.  Well I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with  us for our project.  Well you   re most welcome, it is my honor.  -------  -------
