Speaker 1: And what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: August 19, 1916, at 676 Beckwith Street, deliveries in the home were popular in those days.
Speaker 1: That's here in Atlanta, right?
Speaker 2: In Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Yes sir, okay.  And what is today's date?  What is today's date, sir?  Today.  What is today's date?
Speaker 2: What is--I didn't understand you.
Speaker 1: That's okay.

Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was Daisy, D-A-I-S-Y; Sherard, S-H-E-R-A-R-D; Yancey [Daisy Sherard Yancey]. And put in there Daisy Lois, L-O-I-S.
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth?
Speaker 2: Now, that I'm not sure but, it was, it was January 1, 1881.  That's close, approximately.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And, now what do you know about her family history?  Can you talk about her side of the family?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She was a Sherard, S-H-E-R-A-R-D before she married my father [Arthur H. Yancey] who, of course, was a Yancey.  The Sherards were a large family living in Anderson, South Carolina, and in Iva, I-V-A, South Carolina, which is a very small town and they had a farm on the Savannah River, and she grew up there and was sent to Atlanta [Georgia] to live with her aunt, Miss Buntley, B-U-N-T-L-E-Y, I think, I'm not sure, and, she attended school and received a reasonable education at that time.
Speaker 1: Do you know where she went to school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she went to whatever public schools were available, which weren't much, and I think she went to the elementary part in maybe South Carolina and Georgia and the public schools didn't go very far in those days.  There was no public high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did she have a chance to go to college?
Speaker 2: Did she have a chance to go?  I suppose everybody has a chance to go, but she did not go to college.  She went as high as normal, is what they called it in those days, and then she got married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, are there any stories from the Sherard side of the family that has passed down?  Are there any stories from the Sherard side of the family?
Speaker 2: The Sherard family was named after the white controlling group which was usually at the time, the Sherards, and they lived along the Savannah River near Anderson, South Carolina, so that she was born in the area of Iva, I-V-A, South Carolina, and Heartwood, Georgia [sic.], which is right across the Savannah River, and grew up in that area for a little girl and then they sent her to Atlanta to live with her aunt and to go to school because there were no schools where she was born and was growing up, so she could go to school and get a reasonable education at that time.
Story_ID: 627724
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Arthur Henry Yancey [Arthur H. Yancey], and he was born approximately May 1, 1881, in Macedonia, Georgia, which is right out from Cumming, Georgia, a few miles west of Cumming, Georgia, and he grew up in that area and went to school in that area 'cause segregation at that time was very rigid and then he went in school as far as he could there and then he went to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee Alabama] for one year, but did not finish Tuskegee because his father [Albert G. Yancey] passed away and he had to go back home to take care of the family and the family was in a little town about nine miles west of Cumming, Georgia, and it's on Georgia highway 20 [Georgia State Route 20], and the house where he was born and grew up is still there.  I have visited this house many times, and he went to school in that area.  They walked to school, of course.  There was no bussing (laughter) and then he went to Tuskegee, as I said, for about one year and had to leave and come home and help take care of the family because of the passing away of his father.
Speaker 1: How did he come to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: In those days he walked (laughter).  He walked from Cumming, Georgia to Atlanta along the highway, and he had me walk it one time just to see what it was like and I did, and he, Atlanta was where he could go to school and get an education because there was no school where he was that he could attend and segregation was very strong and very rigid in those days and so he was sent to Atlanta and got a reasonable education.  He topped that off by going to Tuskegee Institute and spent a few months there, but had to go back home because, as I said, his father passed.
Speaker 1: Did he serve in World War I [WWI]?
Speaker 2: No, he did not.  He did not serve in World War I and, of course, not in World War II [WWII].
Story_ID: 627725
Speaker 1: How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: I frankly don't know (laughter) but I do know that my mother [Daisy Sherard Yancey] was living with her aunt and this was Aunt Buntley, and she attended Atlanta University Normal School [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] for a few months, and he, and they met, I don't know where, really, and she got married and did not finish the school.
Speaker 1: Do you know when they got married?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Just wait a minute.  Give me time to think.  (Pause) It was around 1902, around 1902.  Circa 19--.
Speaker 1: Now, who do you take after?  Who do you take after?
Speaker 2: I take after both of 'em (laughter).
Speaker 1: Can you tell us how?  How do you take after both of them, what are you like?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm tall like my father's father [Albert G. Yancey].  My father [Arthur H. Yancey] was not tall, and I'm about the same complexion as my father and mother.  They were both about the same.  My hair is a little more like my father's, and my features are a little more like my father's.  Many have said that I was more like my father than any of his seven children.  That's about it.
Story_ID: 627726
Speaker 1: Can you name your brothers and sisters for us and let us know where you fit in the--?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The oldest was Bernise, B-E-R-N-I-S-E, which is the male form.  C-E is the female form.  He was the oldest.  Then the next one was Prentiss.  His was Bernise Arthur Yancey, M.D., and the next one was Prentiss Q. Yancey, M.D., and then the next one was Forrest C. Yancey, then the next one was Brenda H. Yancey [Brenda Yancey Jervay], and then I came (laughter) Asa G. Yancey [HistoryMaker Dr. Asa Yancey, Sr.], and then younger than myself was Orlando W. Yancey, and then the youngest, the so called baby was Rodrique L. Yancey; that's R-O-D-R-I-Q-U-E.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had two brothers who became doctors before you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's so.  One was Bernise, B-E-R-N-I-S-E, which is the male form, C-E is the female form.  It was Bernise A. Yancey, M.D., and he received the M.D. at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and was killed shortly after graduation while he was interning by a shortage or poor installation or something in an X-ray machine in St. Louis, Missouri.  Then--go ahead with your question--
Speaker 1: Oh, well, now, that story, the story about your brother's death, now he--
Speaker 2: He was the oldest one.
Speaker 1: I was told that that had something to do with the founding of Homer G. Phillips [Homer G. Phillips Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri].
Speaker 2: Homer G. Phillips was not in existence at that time.  At that time, it was St. Louis Hospital No. 1 [City Hospital No. 1, St. Louis, Missouri], which was white, segregated, and St. Louis Hospital No. 2 [City Hospital No. 2, St. Louis, Missouri], which was, and the word at that time was colored, and today it would be black, which was a segregated hospital, and he was working in St. Louis Hospital No. 2.
Speaker 1: Okay, but is it true that, is it true that his death inspired the creation of Homer G. Phillips?
Speaker 2: I have heard that.
Story_ID: 627727
Speaker 1: Tell us about your parents [Daisy Sherard Yancey and Arthur H. Yancey] and how they raised their children.
Speaker 2: Well, my father was a letter carrier and he was also a carpenter.  He learned carpentry at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee Alabama] and, of course, he had a natural bent for building things, so he did a fair amount of carpentry work in addition to being a letter carrier.  In other words, after he finished an eight hour day at the United States Post Office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service], he would come home and do carpentry work at home and on houses that he had become the owner of, he did the repair work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of father was he?
Speaker 2: He was very energetic, very stern, and demanded correctness and got it and if he didn't get it, he would make you wish you had (laughter) gotten it.  Spanking was in order in those days and he was good at it; all too good for my comfort (laughter), and that was about it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, can you tell us about his book, 'Interpositionulification' ['Interpositionulification: What the Negro May Expect,' Arthur Henry Yancey]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that book he wrote which was to set down in writing the whole problem and difficulty with the very bad policy of segregation and he invented that new word as he liked to call it, interpositionulification, and this book has to do with his boyhood and growing up and education and the whole problem of segregation and the evils of segregation.
Speaker 1: Now, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] in his speech, his I Have a Dream speech, uses those words, interposition and nullification.  He says the governments of the South have governments whose lips are dripping with those words, so did you associate that, do you think that he got that from your father's book?
Speaker 2: I know he got it from there (laughter).  No doubt in my mind (laughter) because nobody had ever heard of that word before.  He called it his new word.  He says, "I'm gonna have, invent a new word," and he said, how did he word that, "The people would insert their prejudice minds and intervene in what was going on and nullify the good part," and that was part of the interpositionulification (laughter).
Story_ID: 627728
Speaker 1: Well, we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Growing up?  Well.  The sounds were the cows mooing and the birds singing and the, because we lived there on Beckwith Street and the next house was about a half a block away, but they didn't have any children.  Then there were vacant lots for two blocks, two and a half blocks and then the Allen [ph.] family was about the same number of children as in our family and, but the Allen family was primarily girls and our family was primarily boys and my parents [Daisy Sherard Yancey and Arthur H. Yancey] would have a boy every time they would have a girl (laughter) and sights, sounds, and well, that's the way it was and Beckwith Street was unpaved and very deep gullies and an automobile would have a hard time coming down Beckwith Street if it had rained.  The gullies and mud would be slippery, and so forth.  The sidewalk was, my father had that paved and they wouldn't pave the street and he worked with writing letters after letters to get the sidewalk paved and then some letters that finally got the street paved, and I suppose he wrote people at City Hall [Atlanta City Hall, Atlanta, Georgia].  I don't really know, I was just a child.  But that's about what it amounts to--the sights and sounds.  Well, the sounds were the mockingbirds in the early evening and the crickets during the summertime and occasionally an owl would come and hoot.  That was rare and whenever one heard that he would always call to everybody else and, of course, the children that lived three blocks away giggling and playing, and the colleges were nearby.  Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] was right across the street, and Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] were not far away and, of course, we would hear the Morehouse band while they would practice and if the wind was blowing from Morehouse toward our house we could hear it and the wind stopped blowing and you couldn't hear it.  It was an odd thing.  Atlanta University did not have a band.  They did have a glee club [Morehouse College Glee Club].  That's all I think of right at the moment.
Story_ID: 627729
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about school?
Speaker 2: School?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, the schools were segregated and I went to Edmund Asa Ware Elementary School, which is the public school of the City of Atlanta [Georgia] and went there from the first through the sixth grade and I did that in five and a half years and then I went to Booker T. Washington junior high and senior high [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] and I did that in five and a half years, so then I was a year ahead of my class by the time I finished high school and--
Speaker 1: Were you a good student?  Were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know whether I was any good or not, but anyway, I was valedictorian (laughter) of the class and all, so either that or I had 'em bamboozled (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, let's see, who were some of your favorite teachers in elementary school?
Speaker 2: In elementary school, I think of Miss Hill [ph.] in the first grade, and then Miss Ruby Jones [ph.] and Ms. Mary Jones [ph.] in the second grade.  Ms. Moore [ph.] in the fifth grade, Ms. Wise [ph.] in the sixth grade.  In the third grade, I'm trying to think of that lady's name (laughter); it doesn't come to me so don't, don't wait on it.  Is that enough?  That's enough.
Story_ID: 627730
Speaker 1: So, you got us to third grade teachers [at Edmund Asa Ware Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia].  Do you have, are there any more teachers in, any more names of teachers, favorite teachers?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I remember just about all of 'em, Miss Hill [ph.], first grade; Miss Jones, Ruby Jones [ph.] and Mary Jones [ph.], second grade; third grade teacher, her name doesn't come to me right at the moment, but I remember what she looked like (laughter).  She was a little light skinned heavyset person, and fourth grade was Mr. Jones [ph.], fifth grade and sixth grade Ms. Moore [ph.] and Ms. Wise [ph.], and seventh grade Ms. Wise, and then I was going to Booker Washington High School [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] seventh, eighth, and ninth, so I had many teachers as we changed classes.  One of those was Ms. Ware [ph.], who taught algebra and I liked her very much and still do.  She lived to be 100 years old and I admired her for 100 years (laughter).  She was a very excellent algebra teacher and I enjoyed the course and enjoyed her as a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: Interesting part is that after I finished medicine and residency [at Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], I became her surgeon (laughter) and took care of her for many years.
Story_ID: 627731
Speaker 1: What were you like as a young man, as a young boy?  What were you like?  What was your personality like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Me?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a son of a gun (laughter).  People always accused me of being on the quiet side.  I didn't think so but they did.  I didn't talk a great deal and (pause) well I sort of was just a quiet person.  That's the way my mother [Daisy Sherard Yancey] was and I guess maybe I took that after her because my father [Arthur H. Yancey] was very vigorous and outgoing and I recall when I was elected valedictorian of the class in high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia], you'd have to make a speech, something, sit in the auditorium full of people, so I did.  I remember my classmate, James Huey [ph.], he said, "I didn't know you had it in you" (laughter).  He said, "I never thought you'd get it done," and Ms. Halloway [ph.], the mother of my good friend, Jimmy Halloway [ph.], had some similar comments.  She said, "Asa [HistoryMaker Dr. Asa Yancey, Sr.], I had no idea that you would," and that's about it.
Speaker 1: Well, what were you interested in and you were growing up and--
Speaker 2: Well, when I was growing up I was interested in tennis and I was not strong enough to play football, and shooting marbles (laughter) and, and going to school because it was just pretty much automatic that we went to school.
Story_ID: 627732
Speaker 1: Our home was right across the street from Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], there on Beckwith Street.  The numbers are 676 now.  It used to be 92, and they upgraded the numbers in the City of Atlanta [Georgia] and the house is still there.  It's right across the street from, well that's wrong.  I started to say it's right across the street from the president's home but we were there first, so the president's home is right across that street from us (laughter). We were there a long time before the president's home was there.  But Atlanta University president's home was right across the street from our home place and the house is still there.  The house was designed by my father [Arthur H. Yancey] and he did most of the work in building it.  He would go and work as a letter carrier for eight hours and then come home and work until it was dark, and he would have all of us around him handing him this and handing him that, and holding this while he saw it and everybody took part and he said, "All right, so if you're gonna do nothing, don't put your hands in your pocket. Just stand there, but don't put your hands in your pocket," (laughter).  And of course, you could go ahead and grab something and hold it and take part in whatever was going on.  That's pretty much the way it was.  We were a large family, there were seven of us, and we did like large families did.  We all got up in the morning and I don't see how we did it, but there was only one bathroom in the house but it served everybody and nobody complained.  Everything just seemed all right (laughter).  And get ready and eat breakfast and go on to school.
Story_ID: 627733
Speaker 1: Tell me about Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Did you meet any of the famous professors at Atlanta University?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew some of them (laughter).  You see, our house was right across the street from Atlanta University and Dr. and Mrs. Welcher [ph.] lived right up the street, and Mr. Howe, H-O-W-E, lived right up the street up on a hill and they both were white and they were on the faculty at Atlanta University and our house was right down the street.  Of course, I knew them and the house had, let's see, Henry [Henry Howe (ph.)], they had four children and we used to play together all the time until we reached about twelve or thirteen years old and then we would notice they would become very distant and they would go fitting into the segregation pattern and, of course, we were kids and didn't quite thoroughly understand every bit of it but we noticed that all of a sudden when they used to come by the house and stuff, and eat a piece of hot cornbread that my mother [Daisy Sherard Yancey] had fixed and butter on it--and we had two cows--and we enjoyed playing with each other and all of a sudden they just stopped.  They'd walk by and would put their heads down and not say anything and not do anything.  That's when they got to be adolescents.  They would go to school out there in Mozley Park [Atlanta, Georgia], which was white at the time and segregated, and they'd pass by our house on the way to and from and we would notice that they wouldn't talk, wouldn't speak, nothing.  And they were becoming white (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now, did you know Dr. Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I knew him, as a matter of fact I was his paper carrier for a few days, a few weeks, a few months or whatever, and, but I never had much conversation with him.  I was just a kid and he was--and I went to hear one or two of his lectures and I enjoyed about the first five minutes and after that I (laughter)--I shouldn't say that.
Speaker 1: Well, if it's true.
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: If it's true, I mean, you've gotta tell the truth.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Who else of the, what other professors from Atlanta U did you know or did you come in contact with?
Speaker 2: At Atlanta University?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, there was Mr. Howe, who taught manual arts, woodwork, and they had the Knowles Building, which had woodwork and carpentry, which was not a fancy woodwork, and blacksmith and automobile mechanics and all that in there.  It was Knowles Industrial Building [Knowles Hall], and it's still there now, but it's used as an office building.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what about Auburn Avenue?  Can you tell us about that?  What was that like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Auburn Avenue?  Well, that was on the other side of town, so that we didn't have much to do with that.  We were on what was called the west side, so that we grew up on the west side, and down on Auburn, we would go there to the Royal Theater [Atlanta, Georgia] and pay a nickel or a dime to see the movie, but that's about it.  I didn't get over there much.
Story_ID: 627734
Speaker 1: Did your brothers inspire you to become a doctor?
Speaker 2: Well, I would say yes, but the word inspire is a little strong.  We just sort of did what was expected of us in one way or another.  The oldest one, who was a leader became a physician and the second one kind of followed suit and I guess I sort of followed suit and that's just the way it went.
Speaker 1: Did the other brothers and sisters want to be doctors too?
Speaker 2: No, no.  They did what they wanted to do.  One taught school and the other was a letter carrier, two others were letter carriers, and one was a physician as you see it.  I guess that's about everybody, and my sister [Brenda Yancey Jervay]--had one sister and she taught school.
Speaker 1: Which one of your siblings were you the closest to?
Speaker 2: I guess Forrest [Forrest C. Yancey], because he was right above me going up the scale.  Forrest was about five years older than I and Prentiss [Prentiss Q. Yancey] was maybe two or three years older than he, and Bernise [Bernise A. Yancey] was maybe two or three years older than Prentiss, so that I was right along about the middle, not exactly in the middle but near the middle and so I guess I followed Forrest more than anybody else and I used to follow him around and he'd get tired of it (laughter) and we'd, I don't know, I just, it was an odd thing.  We threw papers as kids.  We all had a paper route, the Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] and the Atlanta Daily World when it came out and we just always naturally, we just did something.  We never sat around.  My father [Arthur H. Yancey] didn't go for that, but he didn't have to; I mean, it's just something we just automatically did.  When the Atlanta World published, I went down there and got the first issue and went on the corner and sold them (laughter).  It was a weekly, as it came out when it first started.  Now I was a carrier for the Atlanta World from a weekly on up to a daily for many years.  I guess I was maybe among the first carriers for the Atlanta World.
Story_ID: 627735
Speaker 1: Who were some of your classmates that, when you were growing up--
Speaker 2: Some of my classmates where?
Speaker 1: Well, growing up in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 2: In public school or in Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 1: In--well, yeah, you can, well either one, both.
Speaker 2: Well, in public school, Alfred "Tut" Holmes [sic. Alfred "Tup" Holmes] was my classmate and my good friend in first grade [at Edmund Asa Ware Elementary School, Atlanta, Georgia] and his father was a physician, Dr. Holmes [Hamilton M. Holmes], and Alfred "Tut," T-U-T, Tut, Alfred "Tut" Holmes.  Tut was a nickname and I were just good friends and buddies.  We played with each other, enjoyed each other's company until we grew up and, you know, went separate ways. What else?
Speaker 1: Well, anybody else?
Speaker 2: Yes, Edmund Allen [ph.], who lived right down the street and I was just a few months older than Edmund and we played together and were good friends up through college and then the white family, they lived right up the street, Henry Howe [ph.], H-O-W-E, Henry Howe and Clinton Howe [ph.] and Alfred Howe [ph.] and Arthur Howe [ph.]; they were a white family and their father was on the faculty at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] and, of course, when Atlanta University folded, well they went elsewhere--I don't know where--and we never saw the boys again.  They went elsewhere because racial segregation was very rigid at the time, they were white so that they never visited or anything of that sort.
Story_ID: 627736
Speaker 1: What was growing up in Atlanta [Georgia] like in those days in terms of segregation?  What were race relations like when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, segregation was very rigid, it was legal and it was enforced and you had to be careful to follow the segregation laws because if you resisted it, you might get your head bloodied.  I don't know of anybody who resisted it much.  I can remember one or two fights between a young white male and a young black male.  I don't know why they were fighting but, because naturally we kind of walked on away when they'd start that because we couldn't deal with one of them.  We weren't strong enough or anything else, and the schools were segregated, the streetcars were segregated, the city hall [Atlanta City Hall, Atlanta, Georgia] was segregated, you know everything was segregated.
Speaker 1: Could your parents [Daisy Sherard Yancey and Arthur H. Yancey] vote?  Could your parents vote?
Speaker 2: Yes, my father always voted and there were certain attempts at inhibiting black voters but those were always dealt with by the federal government.  They would eliminate them as they would come up and my father always registered and I remember when my brothers became of age, I remember their going down with him over to register so that they would vote.  So their voting was a part of the family activities and they always voted.
Speaker 1: Was your father a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  It's odd that you ask that because I remember Walt White [Walter White] coming by the house and I remember the two of them sitting down; I was just a kid, and telling my father all about the NAACP and I guess he joined.  I wouldn't know.  I was too young.  I guess he joined at the time, but I do know that I joined.  I'm a life member and more than that, I'm a Golden Heritage member, which is above a life member.
Speaker 1: Now, do you have any other stories from high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia]?  Do you have any high school stories before you graduated?
Speaker 2: High school?
Speaker 1: Stories.
Speaker 2: Stories?  Well.  I had good friends in high school, Jimmy Holloway [ph.], and Pete Greenlea, and that's G-R-E-E-N-L-E-A, and his nickname was Pete.  His real name was Charles W. [Charles W. Greenlea], but everybody called him Pete Greenlea, and Jimmy Holloway, Edmund Allen [ph.], Pete Greenlea; Roy Norse [ph.], we're not as close as those because he lived on the other side of town.  I didn't see as much of him as I did those.  And, we were all good friends in high school and when we finished high school, well most of us went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], and the girls, you know, just kind of broke up the high school class.  They went to various places, yeah--Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] or whatnot.
Story_ID: 627737
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about Morehouse. Morehouse, tell us about Morehouse.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Just tell us about Morehouse.
Speaker 2: Morehouse.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Well, when I finished high school [Booker T. Washington High School, Atlanta, Georgia] it was just automatic in my family that you went on to school.  You weren't expected to stop just because you finished high school.  Some families, I've heard them say it even after, after I was through medical school [University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] and back home practicing.  I would say, "How far have you gone in school?"  They would say, "I finished."  I'd say, "You finished what?"  "I finished high school," and that was finishing with them, but that was not the way in my family at all.  So, when we finished high school we kept right on going to college, and then to whatever else one wanted to do, whether it was medicine, or whatever or teaching or whatever.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: My sister went on and got a master's [degree] and taught school at Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina for a number of years.  Her name was Brenda.  Brenda Hazel Yancey, and she married a Jervay [Brenda Yancey Jervay], J-E-R-V-A-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let's see.  So, what was your, what did you major in at Morehouse?
Speaker 2: At Morehouse I majored in chemistry with a minor in biology and I remember that there were two of us majoring in chemistry and Lonnie Moore [ph.] was the other one and after a day or two going to chemistry lectures, Lonnie said, "Well, I'll come in and sit but I want you to understand right now I'm through with chemistry."  So that left me by myself, and Dr. Huggins [K.A. Huggins] was the professor and he, Lonnie said, "I'll come and sit in the classroom with you," but he says, "I'm just monitoring the class, I'm not a chemistry student."  So, the class was between Dr. Huggins and myself.  And I said, "My goodness, this is going to be awful.  I can't hide behind anybody," (laughter).  "There's nowhere for me to go."  But it was the most enjoyable class I ever had.  Just between the two of us, Dr. Huggins and myself, and I enjoyed it and, of course, got a great deal out of it.  I majored in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now this, you started Morehouse in 1933?
Speaker 2: That's about right.
Speaker 1: And you finished in 1937?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What other activities were going on at Morehouse when you were there?  Did you join a fraternity or anything?  Did you join a frat, a fraternity?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes.  I joined Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  I joined a science and math club, science and mathematics club and, of course, I was, I had my newspaper route which I was a news carrier every morning and I naturally didn't take part in a lot of college activities that some of the people who boarded in and were there all the time took part in.  I lived out in the city quite naturally and I walked to school because our home was just a few blocks from Morehouse College campus [Atlanta, Georgia].
Story_ID: 627738
Speaker 1: Now, what happened when you graduated from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well (pause), I caught the train (laughter) I caught the train and went to Detroit [Michigan] and I had a cousin there, a Mr. A.W. Prince [ph.] and I was just, my father [Arthur H. Yancey] wrote Mr. Prince and asked if I could live with him and Mr. Prince said, "Yes, I'd be glad to have him."  So I was a roomer in Mr. Prince's home and I walked around Detroit and walked the streets looking for a job and that was in the days of, the Great Depression was still going on and a job was mighty hard to find, but I finally found a little job in a furniture store and my job was to keep the stock room straight with the furniture and keep it ready to place in the showroom to see.  And, of course, while I was doing that I decided to go out to Ann Arbor [Michigan] and look around a little bit.  My brother [Bernise A. Yancey] had finished medical school out there at the University of Michigan and, so I took the train or bus or whatever was moving at the time, and went out there and decided I'd go by the dean's office and tell him I wanted to go to medical school (laughter).  He said, "You what?"  He said, "You haven't even applied."  I'm sure I realized that but that didn't make any difference.  I'm here now and I want to go to medical school.  He said, "When?"  I said, "This September."  That was maybe in July or August.  He said, "No way.  Just forget it."  He said, "We took this class and decided who was going to be a member of this class last March and here you come in here in July and talk about you want to go to medical school.  Just forget it."  (Laughter) So I said, "Thank you very much," and left.  And I knew I had a pretty good transcript at Morehouse and probably better than a lot that he had (laughter) so I went on home and wrote Morehouse and asked them to send my transcript to the dean there at, A.C. Furstenberg, at the University of Michigan school of medicine [University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], which they did, of course, and when I figured my letter had time to get to Morehouse and Morehouse had time to send in a transcript, I went back out there to see the dean and he said, "Well, you're here again," and I said, "That's right, here I am."  He said, "What do you want?"  I said, "I want to go to medical school," (laughter).  "When do you want to go?"  "I want to go this July.  I want to go this September," and here it is July.  He said, "Forget it," (laughter).  We took this class--I said, "Now wait a minute."  I said, "I have my transcripts and you can see it."  But when he got it, he realized it was better than a whole lot that he had and I knew it would be so he says, "Just wait a minute."  He sat there a minute or two and I sat there a minute or two and he said, he reached into the drawer and pulled out a blank form, he said, "Fill this out and come on to school" (laughter).
Story_ID: 627739
Speaker 1: So the dean [A.C. Furstenberg] looked up your brother's [Bernise A. Yancey] record?  Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'd have to presume that he did.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, how did medical school go?  Were you treated properly?  How were you treated at Michigan?
Speaker 2: Oh, Michigan was always very fair to everybody.  Not one time did I feel that I received anything less than I deserved.  It was just, just very pleasant and high quality and equal access all the time.  It was just, that was the policy of the university and they just didn't tolerate anybody deviating from that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were there any special teachers or mentors there for you?
Speaker 2: At Michigan?  Yes.  Yes there were.  Dr. Crosby was a woman, Elizabeth Crosby [Elizabeth C. Crosby].  She taught neuroanatomy.  She was the best lecturer and teacher I have even seen, heard, or was a student under anywhere at any time.  She was absolutely tremendous.
Speaker 1: Now, were there many women on the faculty?
Speaker 2: I don't know how many but Michigan was always very liberal and they had a, a woman medical student long before other medical schools would admit women, back in the 1800s, Michigan had.  I had, I've forgotten how many women were in my class at Michigan but there were several and one was black, Maggie Walker [Maggie Laura Walker Lewis], and there were four of us that were black, Walter Scott [Charles W. Scott], Martin Sutler [Martin R. Sutler], Maggie Walker, and myself.  And the class totaled 144 at the outset and it dwindled down to 124 that graduated.
Speaker 1: Did all the black students make it?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What did you--did you specialize in some aspect of medicine?
Speaker 2: As a student you don't specialize.  You can take electives directed toward a specialty if you want to and, of course, I did that.  I took electives in anatomy because I figured I was going into surgery, so I took every anatomy course the University of Michigan [University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] had to offer, I took it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was there a particular kind of surgeon you wanted to be?
Speaker 2: General surgery.
Speaker 1: General surgery, all right.  Did you know Dr. Louis W. Sullivan?
Speaker 2: Did I--
Speaker 1: Did you know [HistoryMaker] Dr. Louis Sullivan?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, he's much younger and I know him and met him but he was not in medicine at all when I was a medical student.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm asking because he mentioned you in his interview.  I guess he was looking up to you from a younger person point of view (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I met him and have known him quite well for a number of years.
Story_ID: 627740
Speaker 1: So where did you do your internship?
Speaker 2: I interned at City Hospital [Forest City Hospital], Cleveland, Ohio, for one year, and then after that I went down for a surgical residency at Freedmen's Hospital [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] under Dr. Charles R. Drew.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about him.  Tell us about Dr. Drew.  He's a famous doctor.  So many things are named after him.  What was he like and how did you meet him?
Speaker 2: He was just a prince of a person; very energetic, very bright, very intelligent, very understanding.  He was just unusual in every way.
Speaker 1: Now do you have any stories about him?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll just always remember him and look up to him kindly.  He was always very helpful, very understanding, very knowledgeable, and just an unusual person and a principal individual.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, who were some of the other doctors at Freedmen's when you were there?
Speaker 2: Well there was--along with me as residents were Dr. Martin R. Sutler, and then C. Waldo Scott [Charles Waldo Scott, Sr.], and on the faculty at that time was Dr. Burke Syphax and Dr. Greene--his name was Clarence Greene [Clarence Sumner Greene, Sr.]--and Dr. Sam Bullock [Samuel Bullock].
Speaker 1: Was Dr. John Clark [HistoryMaker Dr. John Clark, Jr.] at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] then?  Dr. John Clark?  John Clark?
Speaker 2: John Clark was not there when I was there.  I was there before him.  He came afterwards.
Speaker 1: What about a Dr. Jack White [Jack E. White]?
Speaker 2: Jack White came afterwards.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Could you ask him to sit back please?
Speaker 2: Jack was at, was at Freedmen's, of course.
Story_ID: 627741
Speaker 1: Well, how was that experience?  Had you been to Washington before?  Did you like Washington, D.C.?
Speaker 2: Well, I enjoyed the work there [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.] and I was busy day and night so that I really didn't take part in the activities of Washington, D.C., and the politics.  I wasn't involved in that at all, and of course we didn't have any money and couldn't go anywhere much.  I think we earned about, about twenty dollars a month, something like that, and that was all I had, twenty dollars a month.  I got uniforms free and meals free, housing free, laundry free, and when I was an intern I didn't get anything.  Now the group--that was the City Hospital [Forest City Hospital] in Cleveland [Ohio]--the group that came in after my group said, "We're not gonna work for nothing."  They said, "We're gonna, you've already chosen us and made up the class and we're going on a strike."  So they said, "Sit down and negotiate."  So, they negotiated and came up with a big monthly stipend.  I forgot now whether it was fifteen dollars a month or twenty-five dollars a month but, anyway, it was one of those.  It was not over twenty-five and it was not under fifteen, because we thought that was enough to make a man rich (laughter) and, but that's what we got. When I was an intern, they said, "Well, when you're in medical school you pay tuition, and now we're gonna give you a free uniform and free food.  You can eat four meals a day if you want to, and come in for the midnight meal and have as many desserts as you want, have ice cream, there's vanilla, strawberry, chocolate ice cream bars," and said, "and so you can just eat as many as you want." Said, "We don't care.  But that's your pay and that's it."  And we thought that was pretty good (laughter).
Story_ID: 627742
Speaker 1: Now, you were drafted right?  You were drafted right? Tell us about that.  Were you drafted into the war [World War II, WWII]?  Into the [U.S.] Army, you didn't (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no I wasn't.  I was, let me see, what did I do?  I joined the, as a student I joined the medical ROTC.  Is that right?  Does that sound, make sense to you?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: ROTC?  Reserved Officers' Training Unit [sic. Reserve Officers' Training Corps].  Yeah, that's what it was.  I joined that and let's see, now how did that go?
Speaker 1: Is this in 1941?
Speaker 2: Well, I began as a student and I finished in '41 [1941], so I began four years before that and ROTC must have been in about my second or third year, and I was the only one in ROTC from my class who was black.  There were four of us in the class.  Class totaled 124 and the Army at that time was segregated and I was in ROTC as a medical student and when it was time to go to camp between our junior and senior years in medical school as students, why the commander, Colonel--I'll never forget him--Colonel Leon C. Fox [ph.] from Birmingham, Alabama.  He called me in and said, "Yancey [HistoryMaker Dr. Asa Yancey, Sr.], you can't go to camp."  I was hoping to go to camp with the rest of the class because what they did was send you to Carlisle Barracks [Carlisle, Pennsylvania], which is a medical training camp for the Army, and you stay there for summer, four to six weeks or whatever that was, and at the end of that time, they give you two hundred dollars check, bingo, and you had that for your schooling.  That was great, so I signed up for that and when it was time to go, "Yancey, you can't go."  I said, "Why not?"  He said, "We're afraid you will get hurt."  He said, "There are some pretty cruel people down there."  I said, "I can take care of myself.  I ain't worried about getting here."  He said, "No.  We're not gonna subject you to that."  I realize now he was telling the truth, and, but I said, "I wanna go."  He said, "I'm sorry.  I'm not gonna let you go."  So, I couldn't go and I was trying to think what I did next.  My classmates, the ones in ROTC, went and the black ones, three others, had not signed up to go so they didn't have, they weren't interested.  I wanted to go because you got a (unclear) of about two hundred dollars, but anyway, I didn't go.  So, so that's that.
Story_ID: 627743
Speaker 1: Where did you serve when you--did you serve in the [U.S.] Army?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was a first lieutenant in the Army, but I never got a uniform.  I got a raincoat (laughter) but that's all.  They said, "You don't need to get the uniform."  I said, all right, I won't get a uniform.
Speaker 1: Did you serve in the--
Speaker 2: And I went to the U.S. Marine Hospital [United States Marine Hospital, Port of Boston] in Boston [Massachusetts].  Charlie Drew [Charles R. Drew] sent me up there.  No, I went to Freedmen's, and then Charlie Drew sent me to the Marine Hospital in Boston for additional surgical education, so I went there for a year after finishing the three year program at Freedmen's Hospital of Howard University [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, were you in Boston when Dr. Drew died?  Were you in Boston when Dr. Drew passed away, was killed, in the accident?
Speaker 2: When he died, I was, see that was April 1, 1950.  That right?  Yeah, that's when --
Speaker 1: Let's see.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's when it was.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was in Atlanta [Georgia], I was in Atlanta.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. All right, so we'll just wait 'til we get there.
Story_ID: 627744
Speaker 1: Well in 1945, you became an instructor of surgery at Meharry [Meharry Medical College], right?  Is that 1945?  You went to Nashville [Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: I'm trying to get these years straight (laughter).  And you said nineteen what?
Speaker 1: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 2: That's close.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: But wait a minute.  I'm leaving something out, because you got married right? You got married before then, right?  Tell us about how you met your wife.
Speaker 2: She was a Detroit [Michigan] girl and I was a student at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor [University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan], and, of course, the people in Detroit occasionally would have a little party and whatnot and invite the students out in Ann Arbor [Michigan], and that's how I met her. As a student in Ann Arbor at the University of Michigan we all got invited to this gathering in Detroit and she was one of those who put on that gathering in Detroit.  And then, of course, friends of hers had mentioned her to friends of mine in Atlanta [Georgia], and you know how women are.  They get that thing going and you don't anything about it and then it hits you all of a sudden (laughter).  So that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Carolyn.  Her nickname was Margie, M-A-R-G-I-E, but her name was Carolyn Elizabeth Dunbar Yancey [Carolyn Dunbar Yancey].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did she--what was she studying in school?
Speaker 2: She was in college at Wayne University [Wayne State University] there in Detroit and she majored in education and taught the first grade for a few years before we got married.
Speaker 1: Okay. Did she teach after you were married?  Did she teach at (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just short theories, then she would get a leave and she got leaves so many times (laughter) until the board of education realized that all she was gonna get was leaves, because I was in Mound Bayou, Mississippi as chief surgeon at the Mound Bayou hospital [Taborian Hospital; Mound Bayou Community Hospital] there in Mound Bayou, Mississippi and I went from there to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But she always came wherever I was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the state in Detroit was very erratic.
Story_ID: 627745
Speaker 1: So you started, you started off at Meharry [Meharry Medical College] in Nashville [Tennessee], right, after medical school [University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan] you went to Meharry, then you went to Mound Bayou [Taborian Hospital; Mound Bayou Community Hospital, Mound Bayou, Mississippi] and then to--
Speaker 2: No, after medical school I went to Cleveland [Forest City Hospital, Cleveland, Ohio] as an intern, and then I went to Howard University [Freedmen's Hospital; Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I went to, went to Meharry after Howard.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right.  And, were you a good surgeon?  Were you a good surgeon?
Speaker 2: Me?  I'll let other people decide that.  I don't decide that.
Speaker 1: Did you have any interesting cases of patients?  What about your patients in your practice as a surgeon?
Speaker 2: Well, they--just like surgeon, most of them do well and the occasional one may not.
Speaker 1: Is there any particular case that stands out?  Is there any particular patient that stands out in terms of what you had to do that was a bigger challenge--
Speaker 2: I'm not hearing you at all.
Speaker 1: What was your biggest challenge as a surgeon?
Speaker 2: My biggest challenge was just to learn more and more, as much as you could about preparing people for surgery and doing the procedure and taking care of them afterwards.  The main thing is to get them in good shape and so that they can withstand the trauma of surgery, because surgery is very traumatic and, of course, during the procedure you try to be as gentle as you can to minimize the effects of the severe trauma.
Story_ID: 627746
Speaker 1: Tell us about Mound Bayou [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: Mound Bayou--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --was an all colored town.  The word colored was popular at the time.  It was a small town and they had a, back in those days our people always joined a burial society and they'd pay twenty-five, fifty cents a week so that when they passed away, they would have enough money in that pool to get a decent looking casket and have a decent service.  So, that was, and Mound Bayou was an all Negro town and that was a popular word at the time, and it had a Negro mail and it was just a, the people in the surrounding community and it was just houses here and there and farms and so forth, and the Mississippi Delta country, the land was just as flat as the top of that table, and the people put their nickels and dimes and quarters and fifty cent pieces together and built, and they had a burial organization.  That was what it's for, it's a big house there, but after many years had passed, they found they had a lot of money, so they decided to build a hospital and they built the Taborian Hospital [Mound Bayou Community Hospital, Mound Bayou, Mississippi] and the idea was that the people who were members of the Knights and Daughters of Tabor [International Order of Twelve Knights and Daughters of Tabor] would continue to pay their yearly policy, but they could go to the hospital and get treatment free at the time of service, and they did that, but the chief surgeon that they hired to take care of people began to try to collect fees from the patients.  Some of them would pay, some of them got mad and objected.  So, they came to a parting of the ways and that's how they invited us from Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] to come down and help out, because he wouldn't treat the ones who wouldn't pay him.  So, we went down and became chief in the hospital, so I was running the hospital and he built a little tent across the street and took his friends over there.  We just ignored him and paid no attention.  We just kept running the hospital.
Speaker 1: Sir, what was this doctor's name?  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Dr. Howard [T.R.M. Howard].  He finally moved to Memphis [Tennessee] and practiced there for a while until he retired, I guess, I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is he any relation to the Dr. Howard that was involved in civil rights down there?  Is he related to the Dr. Howard from Mississippi that was involved in civil rights?
Speaker 2: I don't remember anything about that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a Dr. Howard from Mississippi that moved to Chicago [Illinois] who was involved in the Civil Rights Movement down there.  Famous Dr. Howard.
Speaker 2: He did go to Memphis and then to Chicago, and I can't tell you about the other--I don't know anything about that.
Story_ID: 627747
Speaker 1: Tell us about how you came to go to Tuskegee [Alabama] from Mound Bayou [Mississippi].
Speaker 2: (Pause) Put your pen down.  A lot of these things I'm beginning to fail to remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I know them, I know the answers but I just can't think of them anymore.  I'm getting to the point that I'm not (unclear) as well as I would like to.  I was at Meharry [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] and then I went to Mound Bayou [Taborian Hospital; Mound Bayou Community Hospital, Mound Bayou, Mississippi] and then from Mound Bayou to Tuskegee and Charlie Drew [Charles R. Drew] was the one that urged me to go to Tuskegee and recommended to Tuskegee that I be appointed as chief of surgery at the Tuskegee hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which is John Andrew, John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital [sic.].
Speaker 1: Of course, tell us about Dr. Dibble, Eugene Dibble [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.], tell us about Dr. Dibble.
Speaker 2: He was a medical director of John A. Andrew hospital [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and he was a very friendly person, very outgoing, and a very likable individual and a good medical director.  I enjoyed working with him very much and will always hold him in high regard.
Speaker 1: Now, did you attend, I guess, the, I think periodically he would bring black doctors from all over the South to Tuskegee, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was the John A. Andrew Clinical Society and it met in April of each year.  Of course, in April, Tuskegee was gently warm and physicians from up north would enjoy coming down and enjoying some of that good southern sunshine from out of that snow and ice.  And, so the John A. Andrew Clinical Society would meet in April and it was a big event for Tuskegee and physicians from, well, I guess from all over the country would come there.  Those were in the days of segregation before they could go to the meetings of the American College of Surgeons or the American college of internal medicine or orthopedics or what have you.  So, they would come to the John A. Andrew clinic, where they would hear papers by the membership and some nationally known surgeons and interns and so they would have a very, very good medical program outlined and they would come there for educational purposes and to enjoy the good Tuskegee sunshine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was very good.
Speaker 1: So, how long were you in Tuskegee?
Speaker 2: How long?
Speaker 1: So you got there in 1948, right?  You started in '48 [1948], right?  Nineteen forty-eight [1948].
Speaker 2: Forty-eight [1948], well.
Speaker 1: Is it true that you were there from '48 [1948] to '58 [1958]?  Is that about right?
Speaker 2: That's about right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's when I came to Atlanta [Georgia], '58 [1958], that's about right.
Story_ID: 627748
Speaker 1: Tell us about when you found out that--now Dr. Drew [Charles R. Drew] was on his way to Tuskegee [Alabama] when he, when he was killed, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, tell us about that and how--
Speaker 2: Well, as I recall it was one Saturday morning and we received word that Dr. Drew was dead and, of course, it was very shocking and we were all deeply saddened by it and then the details began to come out that apparently he was driving and had been up late in the evening at a junior/senior activity over at the medical school at Howard [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] and went to bed and got only two or three or four hours of rest and got up early to drive to Tuskegee.  He was in a big master Buick [Buick Roadmaster], Sam Bullock's [Samuel Bullock] Buick, and in the car was Sam Bullock, Charlie Drew, Johnson [Walter R. Johnson] who was an orthopedic resident, and Ford [John R. Ford].  Ford was a general surgery resident and they were, the four of them were in the car driving from Washington, D.C., headed for Tuskegee.  The John Andrew clinic [John A. Andrew Clinical Society] was about to start and they were headed for that and apparently they left early that morning and Charlie Drew said, "I want to drive," and of course nobody there refused Charlie Drew anything (laughter). So, whoever was driving got up and moved over and let Drew drive.  Now Drew had been up at a junior/senior prom until sometime after midnight and then they were on the highway around six o'clock that morning and then had to go over and picking up different people, so he obviously didn't get but just a few hours' rest at best.  But he was a very strong individual and he was an Amherst star football player and track man [at Amherst College, Amherst, Massachusetts], athlete.  Just a good, just a good excellent athlete.
Story_ID: 627749
Speaker 1: So they set out for Atlanta [Georgia] and Drew [Charles R. Drew] decided he wanted to drive and, of course, they moved over and let him drive.  It was Sam Bullock's [Samuel Bullock] car.  It was a Buick Roadmaster and so they let Drew drive and apparently near Burlington, North Carolina they were all dozing off.  It was early in the morning and they heard the rattle or the wheeze at the shoulder of the road as he ran off and Sam was sitting in the front seat with him.  Ford [John R. Ford] was in the back seat and Johnson [Walter R. Johnson] was in the back seat.  Johnson was an orthopedic resident.  Ford was a general surgery resident.  Sam Bullock was faculty.  So, they all were startled when they heard the wheels rattling and the wheeze and they said, "Charlie, look out."  And he righted the car suddenly.  He had obviously dozed off a little bit and (unclear) shoulder of the road. He righted it, over righted it and it cut too short and he didn't come back gradually as he might have done if he had more rest.  He righted it all of a sudden and, of course, the car turned over and began to roll, over and over and over, and Drew was a very strong person.  He held on to the steering wheel and the car smashed him.  As it rolled over, he was trying to right it and he bore the weight of the car on him and turned over and cut his thigh, cut all those muscles off and crushed his head and crushed his chest and he, that was around eight o'clock in the morning and he was dead, pronounced dead at ten.  He was obviously dead before then.  And, well, that was just about it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, I guess it was really a bad day, I mean, the conference, what would happen at the conference [of the John A. Andrew Clinical Society]?  Did the people just stop the conference or did you have the conference?
Speaker 1: Well, because we got word and Dibble, Gene Dibble [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.], was the medical director at John Andrew [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and, of course, he decided that Drew would want us to go ahead, so we went ahead with the conference.  So the clinic program went ahead.
Story_ID: 627750
Speaker 1: When you were at Tuskegee [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], did you know anything about the Tuskegee syphilis experiments [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male] on the?
Speaker 2: I heard almost nothing about it while I was there.  I'm trying to think, I have offered many times to see if I heard anything.  I think I did hear a little bit about it, but not enough to, not that much and I heard about it after I left Tuskegee because I didn't hear anything about it in Tuskegee and what was going on about syphilis, and so on.  I didn't know.  That was an experiment from Emory University public health [sic.] people and we didn't have anything to do with them.  We were surgeons.  And, we didn't even know they were there.  So, I had a good friend and he says, "You can't tell me you didn't know all about it."  I said, "Claude [ph.], I ain't heard nothing about it until I came to Atlanta [Georgia]," (laughter).  I said, "That's when I heard about it," so far as dealing in the Tuskegee syphilis, which I think is a misnomer.  It wasn't Tuskegee syphilis; it was the United States Public Health Service study and syphilis and that's the way it ought a be named, but they called it Tuskegee syphilis and gave Tuskegee a black eye when they didn't deserve it.  Tuskegee didn't have anything to do with it one way or the other.
Speaker 1: Didn't Dr. Dibble [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] have to approve it or something?
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: Didn't Dr. Dibble have to approve it or--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Dibble.
Speaker 2: Dibble?  He was medical director at John Andrew [John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital, Tuskegee, Alabama] and I don't know what he did or didn't do, but I doubted he did anything wrong.  He was a fine, upright individual and so that, I have no way of knowing what went on at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I do know one thing.  That Dibble was a fine, upright individual.  That's all I can say.
Story_ID: 627751
Speaker 1: Did you go to the funeral of Dr. Drew [Charles R. Drew] in 1958?
Speaker 2: Did I go?  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, when did--in '58 [1958] you came to Atlanta [Georgia], right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's about right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell us about how that took place.
Speaker 2: Well, the people at the Hughes Spalding Pavilion [Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital] at Emory University, and that was the name of it, the Hughes Spalding Pavilion of Grady Memorial Hospital [Atlanta, Georgia].  That was the full name of the pavilion.  It was segregated and the Emory University headed the whole thing, Grady as well as Hughes Spalding, and so forth, because they, everything there was under the (unclear) of the Emory University School of Medicine [Atlanta, Georgia] and that's the way it was.  And what else?
Speaker 1: Okay.  Let me go back and ask you a question about a publication.  Can you tell us about your publication, 'A Modification of a Swenson Operation for a Congenital Megacolon' [sic. 'A Modification of the Swenson Technique for Congenital Megacolon,' Asa G. Yancey, Sr., et al]?
Speaker 2: Yes, I felt that we could make a modification of the original instead of taking all the layers of the rectum out.  We would just take out one layer and leave the others and reduce the length of the operation, reduce the trauma of it, and make it easier to be performed and with less blood loss.
Speaker 1: Okay. And now W. Montague Cobb [William Montague Cobb], I think, was the editor of the journal that that appeared in.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: For many years, about twenty years.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little about him.  We always hear stories about Dr. Cobb.
Speaker 2: Dr. Cobb was a very bright person, quite energetic, wrote extensively and frequently, and was just a superb student and person who encouraged and recorded the history of black people in medicine through publications in the Journal of the National Medical Association.  He was editor of the journal for many years; I'd say about twenty years give or take, and did a beautiful job.  He was a scholar.  I believe he finished Amherst College [Amherst, Massachusetts] and I'm not sure where he went to medical school.  It seemed to me it was Western Reserve [Western Reserve University], or Case Western Reserve [Case Western Reserve University], or someplace like that.
Speaker 1: Up near Cleveland [Ohio], yeah.
Speaker 2: At West. At the time it was Western Reserve, and then it later became Case Western Reserve and, here again, he was a true intellectual, a scholar and an editor of the Journal of the National Medical Association for, oh, I guess many years, probably well over twenty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, in 1957, Dr. Cobb organized the Imhotep conference [Imhotep National Conference on Hospital Integration].  Did you attend that?  Did you ever attend the Imhotep conference that Dr. Cobb organized?
Speaker 2: I probably did, though I frankly don't remember it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember when he started it.
Story_ID: 627752
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, well tell us about Grady, Grady Hospital [Grady Memorial Hospital] and the Hughes Spalding Pavilion [Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] and--tell us about Grady Hospital, about your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Grady Hospital is the public hospital for Fulton and DeKalb counties [DeKalb County, Georgia] which, of course, it would include the City of Atlanta [Georgia].  Its financial support comes from the two counties, Fulton County [Georgia] and DeKalb County and they pay (unclear) an amount each equivalent to roughly the number of patients from each county that go to Grady.  Most are from Fulton County, but maybe 20 percent or so are from DeKalb County.  It left about 80 percent, give or take, from Fulton County.  It was established way back in about 1892, and it was named after Henry Grady [Henry W. Grady], who always said that the metropolitan area needed a hospital to care for people who did not have the funds to pay for their healthcare, but they should have high quality care and he promoted that concept very strongly so that when they finally built the Grady Hospital, it was after his death, well they named it after him because he as editor of the Atlanta Constitution [Atlanta Journal-Constitution] had pushed the idea of a public hospital very strongly and had done a very good job in doing that.
Story_ID: 627753
Speaker 1: What are some of the highlights of your career at Grady?
Speaker 2: Well, I was invited to come to Grady and to serve at Hughes Spalding Pavilion [Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] as chief of surgery while I was in Tuskegee [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama], and Hughes Spalding, who was chairman of the Fulton DeKalb Hospital Authority, was very active in urging and inviting me and giving me the privilege of coming to Atlanta [Georgia] as chief of surgery at the Hughes Spalding Pavilion.  They were segregated.  Grady was segregated, and everything was segregated.  And, so finally the decision was made to move to Atlanta and become--I was chief of surgery at Hughes Spalding and that was a segregated private hospital for colored people--that was a respected word at the time--for colored people.  It was built for those who were able to pay and who wanted to go to a high quality private hospital, so that's the basis for Hughes Spalding securing funds to build the Hughes Spalding Pavilion all for Grady Memorial Hospital [Atlanta, Georgia], which gave it accreditation by being a part of a fully accredited hospital.  See, it was a pavilion or hall or extension of Grady Memorial Hospital; therefore, it used Grady's approval by the accrediting agencies for its survival and benefit.  So, I was invited to come there by Hughes Spalding, himself, who was, as I said, chairman of the Fulton DeKalb Hospital Authority, and those invitations were issued and sealed for several years while I was in Tuskegee and so finally we decided to come on to Atlanta, and I don't remember the exact precipitating thing but some offer was made and so I moved to Atlanta and became chief of surgery at Hughes Spalding and on the staff at Grady, which was still segregated and so we came on here and started to work, and then as things opened up more, why my work became primarily Grady Hospital and less and less at Hughes Spalding.  So, I was medical director after time passed.
Story_ID: 627754
Speaker 1: In 1962 you wrote an article about the conditions at Grady [Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], I think, for the--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952]?
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 2: Sixty-two [1962].
Speaker 1: Yeah.  You wrote about the conditions at Grady and how things needed to be upgraded, I believe.  In the Journal of the National Medical Association, you wrote about what was needed at Grady, right?
Speaker 2: I'm not hearing part of what you're saying?  I'm not clear.
Speaker 1: Here is your piece here. Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: A surgical residency program at the Tuskegee VA hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Alabama] and the Hughes Spalding Pavilion [Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia].  Is that what you're talking about?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Well, Tuskegee, because Hughes Spalding Pavilion was segregated, and Tuskegee VA was segregated.  At that time the Veterans Administration [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs] had not integrated these hospitals, and together they made a fairly reasonable educational program for residents and the State of Georgia and the State of Alabama at those times had no pavilion, no provisions to train the black physician in any specialty.  You couldn't get educated, or an accredited education in any specialty, so that we began for the accredited specialty training at the Hughes Spalding Pavilion and at Tuskegee to get accredited certified surgical education to the black physician, and that was the only program in those two states that could do that.  There was no other approved or means for a black physician to get an approved education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in 1964, in '64 [1964], you became the first board certified surgeon in Georgia, right?  African American?  You became, in 1964, the first African American board certified surgeon, right?  Tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, the certified boards began by having examinations and the premise of the examination was to test one's knowledge of general surgery and if it was one passed examination, then you would become a certified surgeon, and so that's how that occurred.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then--
Speaker 2: Up until that time, why a person who was courageous enough, he'd just go in and watch a few operations and he'd go out and try it himself.  Patient didn't know no better.  And, they didn't know who was the surgeon and who wasn't.  Everybody called themselves a physician and surgeon; everybody.  If he never had a knife in his hand in his life, he still was a surgeon.
Story_ID: 627755
Speaker 1: So Dr. Yancey [HistoryMaker Dr. Asa Yancey, Sr.], you were, you developed the first accredited surgical training program for African American doctors in Georgia, right, and Alabama, from what I understand right?
Speaker 2: And Alabama.  Not by myself.  I had the help of Emory University [Atlanta, Georgia] and the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now in 1967, you were elected to the Atlanta, was it, school board, in 1967?  The Atlanta school board in 1967.
Speaker 2: That was the Atlanta Board of Education.
Speaker 1: Board of education, okay yeah.
Speaker 2: Atlanta Board of Education.
Speaker 1: Tell us about that, tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Which was the trustee body for the Atlanta Public Schools and I was appointed for two years when Dr. Rufus Clement [Rufus Early Clement], who was a member of the board of education, suddenly passed away and the board appointed me in his place and I served the rest of his term and was elected two additional terms after that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I think the additional terms were four years each, so that was a total of ten years; two with Dr. Clement, and two four year terms by myself.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were some of the issues facing the schools in those days?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Well, they were the same issues that faced everything else; racial segregation, racial separation, and, of course, equality of education and, of course, high quality education and the idea was that they could be separate and equal.  That was the theory of it at the beginning, but they were always separate but they were never equal and since they were never made equal, why it couldn't pass the law so they failed.
Story_ID: 627756
Speaker 1: So, what would you say that you accomplished, what was the board [Atlanta Board of Education] able to accomplish when you were on the board towards desegregating the schools?
Speaker 2: Well, what did we do?  Oh gosh.  That's been a long time ago.  We did several things.  We made Memorial Day an official holiday for the schools.  National Memorial Day in the South was not an official holiday, but that was one of the first things that I did was to get the board to agree to have Memorial Day as an official holiday for the Atlanta Public Schools.  I'll never forget that because above the Mason Dixon Line it was a holiday.  Below, kaput, nothing (laughter) but we changed that and the board agreed to it, just like that, no problem, and we had Atlanta as a public school with Memorial Day as a holiday.
Speaker 1: Now, sir, why was that important?
Speaker 2: Why was that important?  Well, why not join the United States of America? (Laughter) So, that's it.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.  Now, what else?  What else had happened during your stay on the board?
Speaker 2: What else happened?  Lord have mercy (laughter).  Tell me what didn't happen (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, maybe I can rephrase this then.  What happened when the Atlanta schools were ordered to desegregate?
Speaker 2: Well, we had to desegregate the students.  We had to desegregate the teachers.  We had to desegregate the administration and the principals, which we did.  And, we did it through a lottery system.  We didn't let the principal pick schools and (laughter) the lottery, well you know how it is, it works for a while and after everybody got in, they'd begin to transfer among themselves, which you would expect and which happened and nobody objected to it.  And the students could go wherever they wanted to.  They could transfer up from M to M, as we worded it.  They could transfer from a racial minority to a racial majority, and they didn't have to prove anything.  They didn't have to get legal action on anything.  It's just a matter of request.  You make a request, okay, you go.  So, the student in an all-black neighborhood with an all-black school who wanted to go to north side to a school.  They, he or she could transfer and some did; not a whole lot, but some.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well tell us about, did you play a role in the campaign Maynard Jackson?
Speaker 2: I was not a neighborhood campaigner.  He didn't need that.  But I did vote for him, as I recall.  It's been so long I frankly don't remember.  I don't even remember who was running (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was that a, how did you feel about that election?  How did you feel about the election of Maynard Jackson?
Speaker 2: Well, he was very knowledgeable and he was very able.  He was from one of Atlanta's finest families, so that was quite fitting and regarded as something that was too long in coming.
Story_ID: 627757
Speaker 1: In 1972 you were the medical director of Grady Memorial Hospital [Atlanta, Georgia], and also a dean at Emory University at the same time, at age fifty-six.  So, that seems like a lot work for one man.
Speaker 2: No, that's the way the job had those two titles.  You see, Emory University supervised Grady, so anybody who was on the medical staff at Grady would have to be a member of the Emory University faculty.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because Emory University School of Medicine [Atlanta, Georgia] was responsible for the medical care at Grady.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And you couldn't be a doctor at Grady unless you were a member of the Emory University School of Medicine faculty.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In 1975, you were the first African American to be a full professor of surgery at Emory University, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I suppose I don't remember.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well did the--okay.  Let's see.  Well, how long did you teach at Emory?
Speaker 2: I was on the faculty there from whenever it says I started until I retired, whenever that was (laughter).  I hope you have it, because I don't.
Story_ID: 627758
Speaker 1: I know we have, there are several, there are a lot of things that you did during that period of time, but you wrote an article in 1987 called, 'The Challenge of Providing Health Care for the Poor:  A Public Health--,'--'Public Hospital Perspective' ['The Challenge of Providing Health Care for the Poor: Public Hospital Perspective,' Asa G. Yancey, Sr.].  Why don't you tell us about that?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That was a long time ago.  They, because they have problems with providing healthcare to any large group and of course problems were encountered.  Problems had to do with the number of doctors to participate, the amount of money to back the problem and whether the patients had sufficient funds to purchase the medicines once they got the prescriptions, things of that sort, and those problems are common to any system of medicine in the administration existed at that time.  We dealt with them in various ways in keeping with what we had at the moment.
Speaker 1: In those days, Chicago [Illinois] had Provident Hospital [Provident Hospital of Cook County], Cook County Hospital [John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County]. St. Louis [Missouri] had Homer G. Phillips [Homer G. Phillips Hospital]. Harlem Hospital [Harlem Hospital Center] in New York [New York], Freedmen's Hospital in Howard [Howard University Hospital, Washington, D.C.], and some of these institutions are closed down now.  How did you end, the Hughes Spalding Pavilion [Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] closed down in 1989--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and you had to step down from your position.  How do you feel about public health, I mean for poor people?
Speaker 2: Public health for poor people?  Well, of course, I've always felt that regardless of a person's income from zero on up, they deserved the best known medical care of that particular time, and they ought to be able to get it somewhere, and that somewhere in Atlanta [Georgia], of course, was a public hospital, and Grady [Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia] attempted to do that for many years; started way back there with Henry Grady [Henry W. Grady], himself, who advocated before he died.  He died at a young age, seems to be in, he was in his late thirties, about thirty-nine or thereabouts, and died of pneumonia.  In this day and time, they would have treated him and there would have been nothing to it, but antibiotics were not available and, as I recall, he had pneumonia involving both lungs.
Speaker 1: Do you think that we--how do you feel about the closing of black hospitals?
Speaker 2: Well, obviously many of them just had to go because they were below standard and were there because of the segregation laws.  One or two were of a reasonably good quality, St. Louis, Atlanta, Chicago, but it's far better to have them desegregated.  The whole idea of segregation was not a good idea.
Story_ID: 627759
Speaker 1: Are you in favor of the Obama healthcare plan that they started to try to get passed in 2008 [sic. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010]?
Speaker 2: I don't know what the Obama health plan is--
Speaker 1: Well it was--
Speaker 2: --so I can't answer that.  I wish I could, but I frankly just don't plain know what it is.  I presume it had to do with governmental one source of payment.  The government would pay for the healthcare of everybody, and that's a real problem, let me tell you.  In America, that's a real problem because that's a beauty of a problem, for one source to be in charge of the payment, because you, well there are just many factors involved there and the system that we have of multiple sources is working reasonably well but every year that passes, it becomes more and more unified and I don't know what's gonna happen five years from now, one year from now, ten years from now, but it, it's a complex problem.
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about how public health should be handled?
Speaker 2: Public health?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I think the public health under the federal government's a good idea and it's too broad a concept to be made too local because diseases that spread and diseases that are implanted by human beings on purpose, warfare, for example, I think it's a good idea to have more than just local activity and control.  You've got to have somebody who can speak and act for the whole country if a real emergency comes.  A highly contagious disease like the, in the old days, the bubonic plague and things of that sort.  You never know when something is gonna hit us that we aren't prepared for, haven't been vaccinated for, have no vaccine for, and bingo, some virus which has been fairly innocent, decides to mutate and change itself and starts attacking you and me and him, and all hades breaks loose.  It's more theoretical than actual, but still it's possible.
Speaker 1: Dr. Yancey [HistoryMaker Dr. Asa Yancey, Sr.], do you have a medical philosophy?
Speaker 2: Well, yes and no.  Yes in the vain that I think that everybody deserves, regardless of income, the best known medical care for any particular illness and for preventing illnesses, which is high priority to keep well rather than get well, and that's a high sounding thing but it's still something that we all think about from time to time, but that's the main thing and you try to have it arranged so that as Henry Grady [Henry W. Grady] did back in 1892, so that everybody, regardless of income, can get whatever available treatment is necessary for any particular illness they have.
Story_ID: 627760
Speaker 1: When you look back on your career, what today would you consider to be your legacy?  When you look back on your career in medicine, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I'm gonna let them decide that (laughter).  I'm not gonna take part at all.
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you this.  What are some of your hopes, hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: That we will continue to do what we've been doing for the past many years and many decades, and that is to improve our knowledge of healthcare to carry ourselves and develop habits, hygiene habits that are good, and to maintain our own personal individual health at as high a level as we know how.
Speaker 1: Do you have any hopes and concerns about the City of Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: City of Atlanta? Oh, I think it's coming along fine.  Coming along very well.
Speaker 1: Do you have any advice for, do you have any advice for young people that want to be doctors today?
Speaker 2: Just do well from the first grade up.  You might even start back in kindergarten and each step just take it and do well every time and it'll work out all right.  You won't have to worry about tuition and things of that sort.  You may not know how it's gonna come about, but if you've done well and worked hard and produced at a given level, it'll come about in some way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, if somebody tells me I didn't go to school because I didn't have a--well, maybe they didn't see it but there were things that they could have done, maybe didn't know about and nobody told them.
Story_ID: 627761
Speaker 1: Sir, when you look back on your life, is there anything that you would do over again if you could do it or change?  Is there anything that you would change in life, you know, when you look back on things?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Oh, sure.  Things I could do better.  I could have been a better student.  I'm not sure I tried as hard as I should have and I'm afraid there were times when I would study and do what the teacher told me and I could have taken time out and done some research studies, reference work, reference readings and so on, and I'm not sure I did as much of that as I should have.  As a matter of fact, I'm sure I didn't and I wish I had done more.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your family, about your children.  Please tell us about your children.
Speaker 2: My wife [Carolyn Dunbar Yancey] and I had four children, two boys [Arthur H. Yancey, II and Asa Yancey, Jr.] and two girls [Caren Yancey Covington and Carolyn L. Yancey].  As you may know, my wife is passed on and one of the girls is passed on, so we now have two boys and one girl.  The two boys are each physicians and the girl is also (laughter) and the girl that passed was a school teacher.  She taught school at the Booker T. Washington High School [Atlanta, Georgia], my old high school, and we lost her a few years ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, is there anything I haven't asked you that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sure there could be countless other questions.  I don't think of any big one that you've missed, but this could, this could go on for days.
Story_ID: 627762
Speaker 1: Well, the last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, that's up to the people that are left.  I'll leave that up to them and their judgment.  I won't try to get into that.  No, that's up to them.  I don't think I should.  And I'll let them do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 627763
Speaker 1: If you have time we have five little questions that we always ask at the beginning, but I didn't ask them because I didn't know how long we were gonna be here but--
Speaker 2: Well, you can just ask anything you want (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) These are five lightweight questions.  They don't have much to do with anything.  The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Food?  Ice cream.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The second one is do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Favorite--
Speaker 1: Color, color.
Speaker 2: Green.  Green
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Good ol' summertime.  I love it.
Speaker 1: Do you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I love a good hot August day.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Vacation destination?  I've always liked going to the sea coast and that's where I would go most times on vacation, to the beaches on the sea coast down in along the Gulf of Mexico or the northern sea coast, Alabama, where Alabama touched the Gulf down at, what's the name of that little place?
Speaker 1: Mobile?
Speaker 2: No.  Where Alabama--oh shucks I know it as well as I know my name.  Alabama touches the Gulf of Mexico.
Speaker 1: That's Mobile, Mobile, Alabama.
Speaker 2: No, that's way down.  This is up north, along the northern Gulf Coast.  I know it.  I'll get it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Favorite phrase or saying?  Well, I think the main thing is, let's get on with the job.  That's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Let's get on with it.  What are you waiting on?
Story_ID: 627764
Speaker 1: Okay that's the first picture.  Good. Okay, go ahead, let him tell us about it.

Speaker 1: That's my wife and myself sitting and our four children.  This one, we lost her a few years ago.  That's Caren [Caren Yancey Covington], she died, and the other three are still alive.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, so, Caren--
Speaker 1: Arthur [Arthur H. Yancey, II], Carolyn [Carolyn L. Yancey], and Asa, Jr. [Asa Yancey, Jr.].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Left to right.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  That's a lot.  Do you remember the occasion of this?  Do you remember what the occasion was?
Speaker 2: I think that's a Christmas tree, isn't it, right there?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yes, it is.  Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: So, that tells you right away.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Do you want to try and name everybody right there?
Speaker 2: That was Christmas, 19 something or other.
Speaker 1: It looks like '61 [1961] by the tie.
Speaker 2: I can tell you about what year it was by looking at the children.  This was about fifty-eight years ago.
Speaker 1: That's Caren and her husband standing next to her, and that's my wife next to him and that's Caren's twin.  That's Caren, who's getting married, and that's her twin right there, who was a bridesmaid.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  On the far left.
Speaker 1: And that's Sally [Sally Coates Yancey], Asa's wife, and Asa, Jr., and Arthur.  This is Rick Covington [Richard Covington], right there next to Caren.  She is getting married to him.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Rick Covington.
Speaker 1: That's my wife and that's my other daughter.  That's that Beckwith Street cat.  Now be sure to put all those things back where you got 'em.  I hope you remember where you got 'em, 'cause I'm not as good at putting 'em back as I used to be, so it'll be a big help to me if you don't mind putting 'em back.  Ordinarily I would do it and would be happy to, but as I say I'm just not as good at that as I used to be.
Speaker 2: Yes, sir. Describe this one.  Describe this one, who's in this one?
Speaker 1: That looks like me.  Is it?
Speaker 2: I think so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.  That's my wife.
Speaker 2: Okay. All right. (Unclear) get a shot of this.  This is a great picture of him in action.
