 Wilson and I am with the Oklahoma State  University Library. Today is September 4, 2009 and we   re at the  Muskogee Public Library in Muskogee, Oklahoma interviewing Dr.  James Christian. This interview is being conducted as part of the  Muskogee African American Heritage Oral History Project, part of the  Spotlighting Oklahoma Series. Thank you for joining us today.  Nice to be here with you.  Let   s start out with having you tell me a little bit about growing up,  when and where you were born and about your family.  I was born in Hobbs, New Mexico. Grew up in Hawkins, Texas. Spent  some time in the schools in Hawkins, Texas. Then we moved to  Oklahoma. Spent some time in a rural school called Black Jack  Elementary School then to Muskogee. Went to school at Jerusalem  School. From there to Manual Training and graduated Manual Training  in 1956. Family, I was raised by a single parent. Six boys in the family.  All of us went to Manual Training, all of us graduated from Manual  Training High School in Muskogee. Four of us went on to college. Two  of us have doctoral degrees, all four of us have Master   s degrees and all  of us have some college. My mother went to college at Jarvis Christian  College so she instilled within us a desire to get a college degree.  What else about me do you want to know? I finished Manual Training,  went to Northeastern State College. At that time it was not Northeastern  University. Finished Northeastern, needed a job, was hired in Muskogee  at the school that I graduated from to teach science, biology, chemistry,  general science. I also taught some history and English. In those days  you were hired because you had several areas to teach. At a poor school,  you had to teach several areas and not just one. From Manual Training,  we desegregated the schools in 1970. They changed Manual to a tenth  5  Wilson  Christian  grade building and I taught at the tenth grade building. All of the  students in Muskogee had to go through the tenth grade at the Manual  building. It was called the Muskogee High School Annex. I taught  Biology there, eventually moving to the education center to serve as  Director of Curriculum, secondary curriculum and that   s an odd move. If  you want to know about it, I   ll tell you.  From there to Oklahoma University. Was offered a job there working  with the Consultative Center for Equal Education Opportunity. Was able  to go to school there while I was working there and ended up with a  Doctoral Degree. An individual by the name of Norm Gaines moved to  Muskogee to be Superintendent and I did a workshop here and he called  me one day and said,    Hey do you want to apply for the Director of  Secondary Curriculum here?    and, of course, I said no. I was quite  happy at OU. I decided to come down and interview and was employed  here as a Director of Secondary Curriculum for the second time. Then  our assistant superintendent got sick and there were several steps in the  meantime, a number of years. He got sick and I was moved to the  assistant superintendent position here at Muskogee in the 1980s, I don   t  remember the exact year. You should have told me to bring all these  dates out.  That   s okay.  In the late 1980s I was asked to apply for the superintendant   s position  here and I said no. They kept on me. Norm was leaving and I applied  and I became the first black superintendent in Muskogee, the first  superintendent in Muskogee who went to school in Muskogee. And, of  course, was unique throughout the state and served just about on every  committee in the state at that time. They needed the black   that was in  the    80s so you understand what was going on. Left that position in  1991. Own a small store here in Muskogee, a beauty supply and I started  working there. It   s been a good venture for Muskogee. I could not lose  contact with kids so we hired some 56-57 kids to work in that store.  Some of them worked as long as seven to eight years and it gave me an  opportunity to keep in touch with the community.  About four years ago I was called upon   well I   d worked at the school  before then state superintendent Sandy Garrett asked me to go out to  Boynton-Moton to help them out about ten or twelve years ago. I went  out and helped them out. They were on the state list for improvement.  After that, about four years ago, the board members came in and asked  me to help them out. They needed a superintendent so I told them,     Yeah, I   d do it for three months. I don   t need the job, I don   t want the  job.    Ended up working with them for three years and just quit this last  June.  6  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Where is Boynton-Moton?  Boynton-Moton is about 25 miles outside of Muskogee going towards  Haskell. You know where Haskell is? It   s west of Muskogee. It   s still in  Muskogee County. A school of about 130 youngsters, K-12. It was once  mostly a white school. Now it   s mostly a black school because they  combined Taft, which was called Moton, with Boynton therefore it   s  Boynton-Moton. They have about 120 kids, 115 kids. Grades K-12 from  Taft and Boynton. Probably will not exist after this year because I  understand they   re down to some 80-90 kids now, K-12 and that   s not  enough kids.  Before we came in, you told us a little bit about the history of Manual  Training High School. Could you tell us again?  Yeah. I don   t know the date it was founded, but it started out as an  elementary school. I don   t know if you remember back in the day,  whenever that was, if you had a high school diploma, or if you went to  high school you could teach in public schools. The early teachers were  high school graduates and they taught elementary and eventually from  elementary it went to a high school. Again, I don   t remember the date.  But it was founded on the principles of Booker T. Washington. You  remember the Atlanta Compromise Speech that Booker T. Washington  gave in Atlanta, the Cotton Exposition saying,    Cast down your buckets  where you are and blacks, you need to train the hands and become  carpenters, become shoe repair people, become cosmetologists,  whatever. Use your hands to make a living.    That principle was adhered  to by many individuals in this country including presidents of the United  States.  A number of schools were set up after the Booker T. Washington model  which was Manual Training. Training manually. There was a school in  Denver. There was one in Kansas City. All called Manual Training  again, based on the principles that you train the hands. I know I   m going  to miss some. At Manual Training, and I taught there as well as went to  school there, we offered commercial cookery, we offered cosmetology,  we offered barbering, commercial art was offered. Woodworking and  carpentry. There was the NFA. You probably will remember it as the  FFA. At black schools it was called the NFA and it   s not Negro, it   s  New Farmers of America. The other was Future Farmers of America.  They offered homemaking which was teaching kids how to make beds  and do the manual kinds of things to work in motels, hotels. It was  training people to go to work.  And were all those vocations offered until 1970?  7  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Yes. Some of them were picked up by the vocational school. And  remember as you pay attention to all of the courses that were offered,  vocational schools picked up a lot of those courses. We also offered auto  mechanics at Manual Training. I don   t remember all of them, but the  auto mechanics teacher ended up teaching auto mechanics at the  vocational school after 1970 or there abouts. The cosmetology teacher  ended up teaching cosmetology at the vocational school. The  woodworking teacher did not teach woodworking because it was  carpentry then and he was not into building houses. The commercial  cookery teacher resigned. I can   t think of all of them, but many of the  courses were picked up by the vocational school.  Let   s go back to your time as a student at Manual Training High School.  I   ve read that you were in the National Honor Society?  National Honor Society, President of the Student Council, a country  student. I tell people quite often that we talk about desegregation and  discrimination. There was discrimination within Manual Training High  School. I was from the country and there was discrimination against  country kids and city kids. You didn   t come from the country and do  certain things because that was reserved for the kids who lived in  Muskogee proper. We lived outside of Muskogee and from Jerusalem  School, of all places, that went from grades one through eight so it was  after the eighth grade that I moved to Manual Training. So yeah,  discrimination existed. But I became President of the Student Council,  National Honor Society, mainly because of good teachers. I had a couple  of teachers who really helped me a lot. They molded and pushed and  demanded certain things. And they helped me become whatever.  Who were some of those teachers?  Student Council was Claude Riley who taught English at Manual  Training. He had a definite impact upon my life. W. G. Parker who was  the NFA instructor had a definite impact upon my life. Minnie Bonner  who taught typing and all those   see at the black school you had to take  all of these courses because they didn   t offer a lot of other courses for  you to take. Typing had a definite impact on my life. And then, of  course, there was L.R. Kirkpatrick who hired me, recommended me for  a job after I finished Northeastern. He was principal when I was in  school.  And you referred to some things that city kids could do that country kids  couldn   t. What were some of those things?  Coming from the country   and I don   t know what country is now.  Coming from the country, you didn   t know a lot of people because in  8  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  our graduating class from the eighth grade at Jerusalem school there  were probably five or six of us whereas the junior high here in  Muskogee, Dunbar, Douglass and all of those schools, they graduated 25  or 30 kids from each elementary. So we didn   t know a lot of people and  it was difficult to adjust. And all of these kids within the city knew each  other. They played on basketball or football teams or what have you.  And coming from Jerusalem, eight kids, no way. So you had to begin to  assimilate as best you could into that group and it was hard.  How would you get to Manual Training High School?  By bus. Initially by bus. I finally got a job working here in Muskogee  after school. I don   t know if you remember Muskogee then. Muskogee  at that time had a bus system, a number of buses. People didn   t have cars  like they have today. Now I   m dating myself, so you   d ride the bus. I   d  go to work. I   d leave Manual Training, walk to the job at Campbell   s  Caf   where I did the clean-up duties around the caf   for about three  hours in the afternoon. And then I   d catch the city bus to about a mile  from home and I   d have to walk that mile each day after I got off the  bus. So I didn   t have a car, no. You had to ride the bus.  What were some of your favorite places to go around Muskogee?  God. There was Leo   s, but we didn   t go there that much. See we lived  on north 17th Street where I still live. And that   s approximately   I don   t  know how many miles from Muskogee proper. But we didn   t come here  a lot. We   d go to the movies probably once a month and that was the  Grand Theater downtown. You just didn   t come to Muskogee that much.  You didn   t have free time. You had stuff to do around home. My mother  worked, therefore we had to do stuff at home and take care of younger  siblings and all that kind of stuff. So there was not a lot   if you got to  come to Leo   s that was once or twice a month, to the movie about once a  month. They   d have stuff at school and football games and basketball  games. You   d go to probably one or two a year. But you were from the  country and you didn   t have transportation.  What were some of the biggest holidays that you celebrated growing up?  They were holidays that they celebrate now. Thanksgiving, Christmas,  Easter and then, of course, the other days, Mother   s Day, Father   s Day.  A big deal then was Children   s Day.  Really?  Yes, at the church Children   s Day was a big day. Because one of the few  places that you know you were going each week, you were going to go  9  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  to church. I guess that was the social outlet for a lot of us. The church  provided that atmosphere that you needed to develop your skills in  relating to people because you had Sunday school and in the evening  you had what is called BYPU, Baptist Young People         s Association   Union . And you   d go there and that   s where you   d meet the girls and  all that kind of stuff. It took place about 5:30, 6:00 every Sunday  evening. And then they had events at church throughout the year for  kids.  Which church did you go to?  I went to Jerusalem Baptist Church. It was a church within the  community. Initially I went to Black Jack Baptist Church in the Black  Jack community and then went to Jerusalem Baptist Church in that  community. The school was called Black Jack and the church was called  Black Jack, the school was called Jerusalem and the church was called  Jerusalem. So it was named after the communities.  How did you decide to go to Northeastern University?  I didn   t want to go to Northeastern. I wanted to be a dentist. I wanted to  go to someplace like Meharry or Lincoln University and all that. But  financially I was unable to do it. Didn   t go to Northeastern initially,  went to Muskogee Junior College. Bessie Huff was the president of  Muskogee Junior College. It was housed at the Central High School  building. We took our biology in the Central High School building,  which was a white school, by the way. The junior college itself was  housed in a two-story building directly opposite the Central High School  building and that   s where we took our English, History, but I went to  junior college there. Graduated junior college then went on to  Northeastern. Took the courses to get into dentist school or med school:  biology, chemistry, etc. Still financially unable to do it, so what do you  do? At Northeastern you end up teaching. So as a back-up to not being  able to go to dental school I took all the coursework to become a teacher  at Northeastern as well as the courses to get into dental school. A teacher  at Northeastern by the name of Ms. Helen Ainsworth   I shall never  forget her   was working with me to go to dental school and tried to help  me get into Meharry   s but finance was not there. Meharry was the black  school at that time located in Tennessee. So I ended up becoming a  teacher and started teaching in 1962 at Manual Training High School.  And when Manual Training changed to Muskogee did you have to  reapply?  No, didn   t have to reapply. They just assigned you the courses to teach.  Charles Adams became the co-principal at Muskogee high school when  10  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  we desegregated. They had co-principals. Charles Adams, who was  principal at the Manual Training High School and James Sandige, who  was principal at Central High School, became co-principals at Muskogee  High School. And they simply assigned us positions based upon  whatever we were certified to teach. I was certified to teach biology,  chemistry, general science and I was assigned to teach biology at  Manual Training High School which was the Muskogee High School  annex. The chemistry teacher was a long time teacher at Central High  School and no one was going to unseat him from teaching chemistry. Of  course, I taught chemistry at Manual Training but not at Muskogee High  School.  Who were some of your role models growing up?  I think you have role models for different reasons. I don   t think you can  point to one and say that this person inspired me, totally. Of course, my  mother taught us honesty, trustworthiness, all of those qualities. She  definitely has to be a role model. She inspired us all to go on to higher  education after high school. Then, I guess, you would say Kirkpatrick,  I   ve mentioned him before, who was the principal. Parker who was the  Vo-ag teacher. Riley, all of those individuals were role models for me.  But not simply wanting to be like them. They had certain characteristics  that I began to look at and say,    Hey, I admire them.    An example, and I  do some of this, W. G. Parker inspired me to always have a plan. Know  where you want to go. Write your plan down. See if you   re  accomplishing whatever you have on paper. He also taught us,    How  much are you worth   ? I do that periodically. I sit down and I say,    Hey,  I own this, this, and this. How much am I worth?    And that   s important.  He taught us those kinds of skills.  Riley was inspirational in teaching me how to teach because he was, in  my opinion, a great teacher, demanding stuff of kids and yet a friend of  all youngsters. He would not get too close to you to become your buddy,  but a friend to you and you could go to him and tell him just about  anything. So I think for different reasons those people were role models.  Kirkpatrick was a role model. I admired him because he was the  principal and he stood for something. I wanted to model after him after  he became an administrator of public schools because he stood for  something. And I believe if you don   t stand for something, you will fall  for anything.  What were some of your biggest challenges when you were serving as  superintendent?  Doing the job. (Laughter) The superintendent in Muskogee was a unique  kind of position. I   d served as assistant superintendent for about four or  11  five years under Norm Gaines. Norm Gaines was an exemplary  administrator, in my opinion. He demanded things of his staff. And I  guess modeling after him   well let me say, I   ll never forget when he  was leaving he said,    The job is yours if you want it.    And, of course,  they had some 40, 50 applicants for the position. I think I was the only  black who applied for the position. And I waited until probably three or  four minutes before the deadline to apply because I didn   t want the  position. I   d looked at the time he allotted to the job and I said,    I don   t  want to do that. It   s too much time.    An example, Norm was at my  house for three or four hours every Saturday. My mother, who was  living there, ended up telling me,    Why don   t you become  superintendent because every Saturday he   s over here anyways.     But I applied for the position, got the position. Challenges, being black  and, by the way, I think I was the first black superintendent of a  desegregated school district in Oklahoma that was primarily not a  minority school. You had schools like Tullahassee where you had a  superintendent but that school was primarily black. You had Boley and  I   m sure you   ve heard of Boley, being at OSU, Stillwater. But those  were primarily black schools. Muskogee, as you look around the  community, is not a black community. I think blacks make up about 18  percent of the city but about 24, 25 percent of the school district. You   re  aware that the city of Muskogee has two school districts, I   m sure,  Hilldale and Muskogee. When I started teaching, Hilldale was an  elementary school. When I became an administrator in this district,  Hilldale was still an elementary school. So Hilldale   s existence as a high  school is relatively young. It   s not an old school district. Norm Gaines  was here so it had to be in the    80s when Hilldale became a high school,  a K-12 school. We always referred to it as a white flight school. Most  schools at that point   Muskogee desegregated in 1970. So it was  apparent that Hilldale was going to become   they added one grade each  year until they became a high school.  Challenges as a superintendent, I can just refer to some instances. I  received a call one day from a patron in Muskogee and not knowing me,  she ended up saying,    Dr. Christian I don   t know you, but they should  have kept the niggers at their school. They don   t need to be at this  school.    I mean went on and on and used the term nigger several time. I  finally said,    Ma   am, you need to come in and talk with me and we can  just talk about all this stuff.    I shall never forget, the lady walked in,  looked at me, and her mouth dropped wide open. I mean she was      Oh,  I   m so sorry     Became one of the best supporters of the school and a  best supporter of me. I can refer to instances like that. I had more  support I think from the white community than I did from the black  community because black people expected me to do things that I  couldn   t do that were not legitimate, that were not       I remember one  12  Wilson  Christian  instance where a black came and said,    Hey, you   re the boss now you  can let me do this.    I said,    No, I can   t. It   s not legal,       Well other  people did it.       Well that   s not a reason for me to do it.    And I think the  expectations were that   even with the president now, I think the  expectations are that,    Hey, he   s black, he   s going to let blacks get away  with this and that.    You can   t do that. The law is the law. The rules are  rules. Regulations are regulations and you have to follow them.  I ended up becoming interim superintendent at Boynton-Moton because  of the record here. I mean I was fair, I was honest. I followed the  regulations and got to know state people. Schools are political and I  think that   s one of the reasons that I wanted out of it, out of Muskogee  was that it was too political for me. I had an excellent board. There were  five members on the board and I see them periodically here in Muskogee  and one or two of them say I was the best superintendent they ever had.  But I was the only one that they worked with. (Laughter) Liz McMahon  who works for the Phoenix and I don   t know if you   ve met her, she  knows as much about this school district as anyone because at that point  the Phoenix had a reporter assigned to education. I mean that   s all they  did was education. In a small community like Stillwater or Muskogee,  education is the biggest thing going. You have the university there and  that   s still education. That   s where the emphasis for our local media  would be. Here was the school district and Liz often refers to people  when she introduces me as the best superintendent Muskogee had, so I  don   t know. But it was interesting. The challenges were no different  from challenges that white superintendents faced except I was black and  I think the expectations from some people were greater. And I think I set  some expectations on myself that were too great.  Do you want to talk about desegregation any in the high school?  I   m glad you mentioned desegregation because I firmly believe that  there are no schools that are racially integrated. I think the two terms are  different. I think people use them synonymously, integration and  desegregation. They   re not. Desegregation is merely the mixing of  people together. You desegregate. You bring black kids and white kids  together. It   s no big deal to do that. The biggest deal is to integrate the  schools. And that   s where kids begin to form interpersonal relations;  staff forms that. You don   t have a lot of emphasis on hate, black kids  fighting black kids, white kids fighting white kids. You still have some  of that. Schools are not integrated. I think they   re desegregated and you  finished in Stillwater, you have a few black kids in the Stillwater school  district. You know people often refer to black kids sitting by themselves  and I   m sure you   ve heard that. If black kids are sitting by themselves,  let   s go one step further. Then white kids have to be sitting by  themselves. So it   s a situation where we begin to meet and do some  13  Wilson  Christian  things to bring about integration. You   re always going to have some  people sitting with people they know. It should not be based on race  though.  Manual Training produced several black doctors. I can think of Dr.  Wiley and Dr. Chandler and these are medical doctors. Dr. French. I  don   t think since we desegregated in the    70s that we have produced one  black doctor. And I think that could be true of several school districts  across the state. I can remember when we had a youngster who qualified  for valedictorian or salutatorian, I don   t remember which. There was a  controversy here regarding her grades, someone changed one of her  grades. Norm Gaines was superintendent here and she was a black kid.  The parents demanded that the grade be changed or something like that  whereby she could become valedictorian, salutatorian. It created a big  mess in Muskogee. The teachers got angry. The Teachers Union got  angry and a lot of stuff happened behind it. She ended up getting the  grade. She became the valedictorian or salutatorian, I don   t remember  which one, but I don   t think since then we   ve produced a valedictorian  or a salutatorian.  I maintain that there are very few schools that are racially integrated.  People often refer to Tulsa Washington as an example of a school that  it   s a magnet school and they brought in some white kids and all this  kind of stuff. But you walk through the building, unless it   s changed  significantly, they offer Chinese and you can imagine who is taking the  Chinese courses. They also still teach beginning math or elementary  math and you can imagine who is taking the elementary math. You look  at the football team and the football team is still primarily black. The  golf team is primarily white. I don   t know if we made the kinds of  strides that we should have. Are things better? Yes. Just by getting them  together they   re better. A dude by the name of Coleman who was  involved in the rationale for desegregation in the United States said,     Simply by putting a black kid next to a white kid does not necessarily  improve education.    I mean it   s what you do after you put the black kid  and the white kid beside each other in the same building that   s going to  impact it. There are also studies that say grades one, two and three and  you look back on your own education, black kids and white kids achieve  just about the same. It   s in about the fourth or fifth grade that the gap  starts to widen. There are reasons for that that I don   t think we want to  study in this country. You didn   t ask for all of that, but I gave it to you.  (Laughter)  I   m glad. What world or national events have significantly influenced  your life?  I think the Supreme Court decision of 1954 influenced all of our lives  14  Wilson  Christian  because that was the case that says separate but equal is inherently  unequal. I finished high school in 1956 from an all-black school and I  think since then went to Northeastern, went to Muskogee Junior College  desegregated. I think the decision began to show me that,    Hey, you can  achieve, you can compete.    At Manual Training we were taught that  you   ve got to be good, you   ve got to be better than in order to compete  in this society that had more racial contact than ever before in the  society. I think we were taught that, that you   ve got to be better in order  to compete. And I think that the Supreme Court decision, going to  Northeastern, Muskogee Junior College, showed me that I could  compete.  Going to OU, and we   re still looking at the Supreme Court decision,  showed me further that I could compete. I got interested in and involved  with a professor at OU by the name of Glenn Snider. Now you know  Glenn Snider was not black, at OU. OSU doesn   t have that many either.  Glenn Snider took an interest in me and whenever he was absent from  school, I would take over his classes and I would teach. And two or  three times after teaching then as a graduate student I was the person that  if Dr. Butler was absent, I would take Dr. Butler   s class. If Dr. Bibbens  was absent, I would take his class. I think it showed me that I can  compete. I was a student in those classes and yet I was the one assigned  to teach the class. That inspired me. So the Supreme Court decision of     54 had a great impact.  Just graduating from college had an impact. You   re a recent graduate, it  impacts your life. Being elected superintendent had an impact on my  life. Getting a job teaching in Muskogee impacted my life. There are a  lot of them. I think people are saying the selection of Obama impacted  my life, but I don   t know if it did. I mean he   s so far away. I   m glad he   s  there, but it didn   t have a significant impact upon my life. You said  significant. I don   t know, just things that happened to me. I don   t know.  Next question.  Well what in your life has brought or given you the greatest satisfaction  or fulfillment?  Helping people. Helping kids. I really think that teaching and  involvement in education is a calling just like the ministry or anything  else that you have whereby you can help somebody and if you   re not  helping then you   re hindering. I mean there are only two things you can  do, you can help or you can hinder. I   ve seen teachers who   ve hindered  education of young people. On the other hand I hope that I   ve helped  some kids. When you see kids that you taught 20 years ago, 30 years ago  come by and say,    Hey, I appreciated it.    It takes that number of years  for them to finally realize that what you were saying was true and you  15  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  know the impact on kids today is significant. Just last week, kids that I  worked with at the Boynton-Moton schools as superintendent were in  the office. One of them has been in jail for several months. He got out of  jail and was falsely accused. And the first place he wanted to come (he  graduated last year) was to the store and said,    Doc I had to come see  you and let you know that I   m out and I didn   t get any charges.    So that  kind of impact that you have on the kids, that has been a guiding  principle throughout my life as an educator.  One young man, Billy Hamilton is a white kid and wrote a little book  and talked about the impact I had on his life. Those kinds of things mean  a lot. There   s a Dr. Roger Montgomery who is a doctor in Fort Smith,  Arkansas, a medical doctor. They recently interviewed him and  somehow I got a copy of the article and they asked him what teacher had  the greatest impact upon his life and he said me and he   s a white  individual. So I think you impact individuals whether they   re white or  black and you want to make a significant contribution. Did you help  somebody? Did you cause people to achieve? Did you cause people to  do right? Did they look at you and say,    They can   t be like me and I  can   t be like them but hey I want some of those principles in my life of  helping someone.    One of the things the 50-some kids who   ve worked at  the store we teach them is that we helped you. Then you turn around and  help somebody else. And that   s the way that life has to exist.  What is one thing that you most want people to remember about you?  That I tried to help. I mean, you can point to a lot of things that by living  did you really help someone? I think that   s the key issue to life. Did you  make the world a little bit better by doing what   s right and when you do  what   s right in my opinion you   re out there helping somebody. I think  there   s a song,    You don   t want your living to be in vain. If I can help  somebody as I pass along this way, then my living will not be in vain.    I  think that   s what it   s all about. Encouraging, and it   s not money all the  time. It   s not money that you   re dealing with. It   s somehow telling,  teaching, motivating   whatever term you want to use   that person to do  better.  Tell me a little bit about where you were born.  I was born in Hobbs, New Mexico. My parents were in Hobbs because  of cotton picking. They went there to pick cotton. They were sort of  migrants and while they were there I was born. I was born in a tent.  They set up a tent for blacks as a hospital. Blacks could not go to the  downtown hospital, whatever it looked like. So I guess the tent was set  up near the cotton picking area, but that   s where I was born. I remember  very little about Hobbs, except I ended up getting my birth certificate  16  Wilson  Christian  from Hobbs and it says Hobbs. I   ve always wanted to go back to Hobbs  New Mexico, I   ve never been there. But from Hobbs, we moved back to  Texas.  One thing I didn   t share with you and just for your information, my  dad   s family was very wealthy. Back during slavery, they were brought  from South Carolina to Texas and they were freed while they were in  Texas. The slave ancestors were my great-grandfather and all of them,  my great-grandmother. They were freed while they were in Texas. The  slave master   s name was Christian, so we don   t really know what our  name was. You   re aware that slaves at that point took the name of their  master, so they took the name Christian. He ended up giving them what  he thought was the poorest land in the area. He gave them I don   t know  how many acres, but he gave them land or they bought land. They ended  up striking oil on the land that he gave them. This happened also in  Oklahoma. You remember the Osage Indians? We thought we were  giving them the worst land in Oklahoma and gave them land that had oil  on it and they became very wealthy. He ended up giving them land and  they struck oil on the land.  I   ve been down to Texas, go down probably every two or three years.  Shiloh, Texas is where they were born. I don   t remember a lot about it,  but even the church there has oil wells on it. But coming from a wealthy  family to a poor family   moving to Oklahoma my dad, bless his soul,  was a sorry rascal. I mean that was just the reality of it, didn   t have to  work, alcoholic. I mean the six of us have every opportunity to be  nothing because the dad was nothing. But it shows the impact of a  mother who says you will be something. And I don   t buy all this  philosophy that single parents can   t raise a kid, they can. And she raised  us. But very, very wealthy.  I can remember living in Texas. My grandfather built us a house on the  property where his house was. And I can remember his house in  Hawkins was probably one of the first houses that had an inside  bathroom. Now blacks were not the major group in Hawkins, whites still  owned it. My grandfather had a dude that was head of his estate, a  trustee, a white dude who was the executor and he protected him  because back in that day if you had a little money, they would take you  to court and take it from you. But this white dude took it over and  protected my grandfather up until I guess we were adults. Because we  ended up firing the white dude because we could manage it. And when  we fired him there was nothing to manage. (Laughter)  So there   s not still property in your family in Texas?  There   s still oil property, yes. And we   re in court now trying to settle  17  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  Christian  Wilson  some issues. I   ve gotten more out of my dad since he died than I did  while he was living and that   s sad to say. I mean he could have really  educated all of us and provided for all of us a lot better but he didn   t.  And after he died, then the stuff was split up and financially we    My  dad would take us down to Texas once a year and buy us school clothes.  Buy us two pair of pants, a pair of shoes, a coat and two pair of Unions.  Now you don   t know what Unions are.  No.  Unions are winter   you know what thermal wear is?  Yes.  Okay, Unions were thermal wear except they were one piece, the top  and bottom were all connected. He would buy us two pair, and that was  the extent of it. And he would not do this, the executor of the trust would  take us to the store and buy us all of that. And my dad was, bless his  soul, he was out drunk someplace probably.  Were you young when he passed away?  No, I was teaching when he passed away. I don   t remember the year but  it had to be in the    60s when he passed away because we went to his  funeral. I guess he was my dad, and my mother taught us that he was my  dad, but I don   t think there was a lot of love because we didn   t know  him. Except,    Hey, that   s your daddy.    Because mother was dad and  mother too.  Well is there anything that we haven   t talked about?  I think this has been an interesting venture.  Well thank you very much for talking to me today. I appreciate it.  -------  -------
