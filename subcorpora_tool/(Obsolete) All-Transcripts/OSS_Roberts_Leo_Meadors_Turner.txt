 Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Today is Friday, October 6, 2006. I   m Karen Neurohr with the OSU  Library. We are interviewing Mr. Leo Roberts and Mr. Turner Meadors,  and we are at the Best Western in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This is the O-STATE  Stories oral history project of the OSU Library. Thank you for  coming here today to be interviewed. I understand that you gentlemen  were on the first rodeo team at OSU, and it was OAMC at that time,  wasn   t it?  That   s right.  Well tell me a little bit about what it was like to put together that first  rodeo team.  Well, we all liked to compete and we wanted to go somewhere, so  Lawton was having one and we went. Didn   t we?  The head of the Animal Husbandry Department, they called it then, not  Animal Science   he kind of looked down his nose at rodeo things and  they wouldn   t let us have a club.  Everybody did up here.  Yes. So we got a hold of Clem McSpadden and some entry blanks from  the Cameron Aggies, and I guess I can tell this   he forged   they had to  have a sponsor   s name. He forged a teacher   s name out of the Speech  Department on there.  Each one of us forged a different name every time we went to a different  rodeo. We had to do that to get entered.  5  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  And then we went down there and won it all.  Oh, you did? Well, that was a big day then.  So it kind of got in the papers and they took some pictures. And from  then on we could participate, but we had to pay our own way.  We never had any financial support.  No.     from the college or any recognition from the college.  Oh, you didn   t?  No, just a bunch of freshmen        but we had a big time        went down there     So, what events did you compete in? Mr. Meadors, let   s start with you.  I competed in the calf roping and, I think   were you in the calf roping  or bulldogging or     Yes, I was a calf roper and a bulldogger. At one rodeo, I got the  bareback ride.  I thought one of us did. I thought at first it might be Larry  Kilgore  but I  knew then after talking to you it wasn   t Larry that got in     Both of us got in.  Did he?  Yes. Both of us got bucked off. (Laughter)  Well, how many seconds did you stay on?  Well, Freckles Brown was judging and Bud Reger and I stayed the  whole night with Freckles. I was in mid-air when the whistle blew.  Oh, you were?     and Freckles said,    Boy you had it won.     6  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Meadors  Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Meadors  Neurohr  Roberts  You almost had it then?  I   m glad I didn   t because it might have gone to my head and ruined me.  That   s the only one I ever got on.  You said that you won the big all-around champion team award that  first year and where did that take place at?  Lawton.  In Lawton.  What was the name of that college there? They   ve changed the name  since.  They gave us a trophy, and that trophy I guess is down at the Cowboy  Hall of Fame  National Cowboy and Western Heritage Museum .  Somebody said it   s going to be up here this weekend, but     Well, I   ve heard that trophy   s down there and so   that   s good that you  all put the trophy someplace where it could be preserved.  I think Ed Apple was responsible for that because he was, at that time,  corporation commissioner     Somebody got us together   how many years ago?  Oh, five.     and we were honored by the House of Representatives down there.  Oh.     and they marked our absence from the time we went to Lawton as  excused.  We were excused. (Laughter)  Well, good.  It was a big deal.  Do you have any stories about memorable incidents at any of the rodeos  that you want to share?  Well, I could say this. I never went to one of those that I didn   t place  7  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  somewhere. And I only went to one that I made enough money to get  back home on. (Laughter) That was at Kansas State.  Yes, we won. That   s where Harold  Emery  got hurt.  Yes. Harold thought they had     That time he went across the pitcher   s mound   the steer kind of dropped  down and he missed his head and hit the ground and here comes the  hazing horse.  Ran over him.     clompety clompety clomp    (Laughter) I think every hoof on the  horse hit Harold.  And we got back home, oh a little after daylight the next morning. He  couldn   t get out of the car. Well, he got out and opened the gate and got  down in the ditch and couldn   t get out.  I had him open the gate. I was driving and I told him   I said,    Harold  you   re going to have to open the gate. I can   t walk.    So he couldn   t  either   but anyway, he fell over in the barn ditch. We had forty acres  rented out there where we kept our horses. At one time we had the  fairgrounds rented   the barn and that sweet old gentleman Mr. Blue  lived out there on the fairgrounds and he took care of the horses in the  mornings when we couldn   t get out because we had classes. And Harold,  he   liked to have killed him, but he was sore.  Ruben J. Cleaners  was  still here. There were four or five of us. He let  us build an arena out there where   on his place out southwest of town,  and we kept horses out there for two or three years.  Probably after the    50s.  Yes, you were gone.  I left in    50.  Anyhow, but Harold and Reger and I had horses out there.  I didn   t know about that. The old boy that ran the cleaner shop   do you  remember him?  No.  8  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Meadors  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Neurohr  Meadors  Neurohr  Meadors  Neurohr  He had the cleaner shop there on about Fifth Street, and he kept horses  out there. That   s where Glen Robertson kept his horse. Do you  remember the trick riding horse he got off of Buck Brady?  Yes, yes.  Well, did you have entry fees for the rodeos?  Yes.  How did you pay for the entry fees?  Out of our pocket.  So did you work while you were in school, too  I never did. I was going to school on the GI Bill.  Okay.  I was, too.  Oh, you both were on the GI Bill.  If it hadn   t been for the GI Bill, I never would have made it.  I got tired of writing home and hollering,    Hey Mom, send money.     That helped some. Leo   s mother made shirts, western shirts. She was a  wonderful seamstress. And she   d just sew those shirts day and night as  long as she had to make. They were beautiful shirts   all out of denim      and seersucker   you know, she made some of those shirts out of  seersucker.  Did you all have matching shirts then for the team?  No. We just had our reputation   tough.     a tough reputation. (Laughter) Well, you have to be tough to compete  in rodeo. I think there   s more injuries in rodeo than just about any other  sport.  Well, my deal wasn   t too rough. But you talk about riding bucking  horses, that   s pretty rough. Too rough for me.  Well, I   d like to hear a little bit about your years at Oklahoma A M  College and some of your memories about the campus and what the  9  Meadors  buildings were like   and where did you live when you went to school?  Mr. Meadors, where did you live?  Well, I got out of the Navy in    46, June 20. I went to Cheyenne,  Wyoming that July. I ran into a friend of mine that had gotten out of the  Navy since I had and he said,    What are you going to do?    And I said,     Well, I have no idea.    And he said,    Well, let   s go to school.    I said,     Okay, where do you want to go?       Well, let   s go to Oklahoma  Agriculture and Engineering in Stillwater, Oklahoma.    I   d never heard  of Stillwater, Oklahoma. I lived 150 miles southeast of here. Never  heard of Stillwater. So I said,    Okay, let   s do it.    So we did.  We came up and enrolled and I lived over on Lewis Street. We rented  one room and privileges of one bathroom. Now this was in    46   and  that was it. And I had a car. I bought a car   first car I   d had. I was  twenty-one years old when I got out of the Navy and I bought the first  car I ever owned and my folks had a car dealership in Oklahoma City     604 West May. Well, that was my first stop and I acquired the car and I  came on to school. Okay, I got up here at school. We broke up after the  first semester in that little room and one bathroom and two old gripey  people. They couldn   t stand us and we couldn   t stand them so we quit  even. But anyway, I guess the semester started then the next semester  started and I had to come back   I don   t know how we   where we  stayed after we moved out down there, but we dissolved partnership. He  went his way and I went mine.  And I had a car, and I was very popular   you know, I had a car in    46.  So they were having a football game that Saturday and I stopped to  watch the band go by. Well, here comes the twirlers, and I saw the most  beautiful girl I   d ever seen and I said,    Whoa T, you   d better back up  and let   s look this deal over.    (Laughter)    and I married her. Beautiful.  And we got married and came back to school and I   m kind of mixed up  on time and all but anyway they were still having school so we got  married and we came back up here and over across the street from the  old part of the stadium. That little short stadium you know they had the  football field. Well, there was a street there, 606 McGeorge. There was a  fellow building apartments there, so I noticed I   d better get a hold of him  and see what the deal was. So I made a deal with him   that was when  you couldn   t get a car, they had cars, but you had to know somebody to  get one. So this fellow said,    I need a car.    He found out that I could get  one. Well, I said,    Well, I need an apartment.    We made a deal. I got  him a car and he got me a new apartment so we were happily united  then. I guarantee you the dust was so damn thick down at 606  McGeorge. We didn   t have any curtains or drapes. We hung sheets over  the windows, but we were happy, you know, in love and all that good  stuff. And so then in 1950 we moved to Wetumka and I had already  10  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  started ranching and I bought a ranch down there and that   s where we  raised our three sons, and we   ve still been there.  Okay, Mr. Roberts. What about you?  My first year up here was in    46 and housing was a problem. All the GIs  were coming back to school. Well, we jumped from 5,000 to  what   15,000 just overnight        made a village out there on the hill   that Vet Village, do you  remember that? I think 3,000 people lived out there.  Another boy from Tulsa and I   there was a house way down toward  town, a good ways off of the campus   and they had put glasses on the  front porch, glassed it in   and they had a bed in there   and that was  where we roomed. No heat. Light bulb hung down on a string. But we  were there one semester and then we moved up here on Knoblock where  some folks had a big old two story house, and I think there was twenty-five  of us that lived upstairs    (Laughter) and shared one little old  bathroom.  Oh my.  And I just lived all over there   I never did live at the dorm. The last  semester I was here, Glen Bratcher was over the Animal Husbandry  Department, later became head of the Department   he kind of took me  under his wing and was sort of a second father to me and kept me in  school. I wanted to quit and go to work. He made sure that I stayed. The  last year I was here I lived with he and his wife, and I met my wife here.  Her first semester here was my last semester, and we had a college rodeo  here then. Well, my brother and I were up in wild cow milking. In those  days you only had two people in wild cow milking. Now they   ve got  four.  They have, four?  A lot of them do. But anyway I was roping and Bob was mucking and I  called for this cow and let my horse   s head down and two little old girls  crossed in front of the box. I had to check my horse. Bob reminded me  later that we did win the cow milking anyway. One of these little girls I  married the next spring, and we   ve had a long, wonderful life together.  She   s here tonight.  One of them was Jimmie?  That was Jimmie.  11  Meadors  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  You   re kidding. Her father sold Hush Puppy shoes. You ever hear of  Hush Puppy shoes?  Yes, sir.  Her father had five shoe stores. When I graduated, Koch Oil Company   then known as Rock Island Refining  had bought their first big rights     that deal in Montana   and I went to work for them. I went to Dillon,  Montana, the first day of February and I came back home the first day of  April. (Laughter) Jimmie and I got married that spring. And for forty  years   we wound up in Ardmore and I managed Daube Cattle Company  for forty years. They had a retirement program, and at 65 you   re history,  and I wasn   t ready to quit work. I started buying cattle and I   m still  buying cattle.  Patty and I were married fifty-nine years. That   s a long time.  Yes.  And in 1972 or 1973, I guess, was honored as a distinguished graduate  in Animal Science, and I   m very proud of that.  That   s quite an honor. That   s very nice.  And Bob Totusek later became head of the department and we became  real good friends. We   re staying with them this weekend. We visit quite  a bit. But I feel OSU is   I   m indebted to them. Because I was raised     we had a great family but very little money. Things have gone very well  since I got out of school.  Well, I   m sure that you both remember when the name changed.  Yes.  What did you think about that? What was going on with the name  change?  Didn   t give it a whole lot of thought, I don   t think. Did you?  No, I had an old history teacher back there. He said,    I don   t know what  you kids are working so hard for      said,    Congress will pass a law  some day and nullify all of it.    And they changed the name of the  school. They changed the name of our degree. (Laughter) But it didn   t  really matter all that much. I wish it was still Oklahoma A M.  Do you?  12  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Yes.  The campus was solid Quonset huts.  All the classrooms were Quonset huts.  Yes, that   s what the Quonset huts were for, classrooms. The old English  building, you know, we still had classes there. I had two classes in it, I  remember, back by the fire station.  Yes.  What did they call that old building, the English building?  Old Central.  Old Central.  And the Animal Science Building, when it was built, was the most  expensive building on campus. Of course, it   s gone now. They tore it  down and built a new one. A lot of fond memories.  Every Quonset hut had a line after it. After you   d been in the service a  year or two it didn   t make any difference. Wherever you   d see a line you  just stop. You know you get in line. (Laughter) We were in and out of  more lines up here on campus   you   d find the campus very  discouraging I   ll guarantee it because you may wait thirty or forty  minutes and be in the wrong line and for the wrong class. Most of them  were hot. You know how hot it gets in Stillwater.  We   d all just got out of the service, and we stood in line for the whole  time we were in service. Everything you did you got in a line for.  That   s exactly right.  Well, did you ever meet Frank Eaton? You know he   Pistol Pete became  the mascot?  He was here. I never met him, but we   d see him on the floats at the  homecoming parades.  I never have seen his face.  No.  My grandsons graduated here two years ago and I shook hands with him  13  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  and had my picture taken. But his head is not up in that head, is it? His  head is down below the shoulder part.  That reminds me. I   ve got two grandkids in school up here now.  Oh, do you?  Yes.  So you have several family members that have come to school here  then?  All my children        followed in your footsteps?     Yes.  We   ve had two grandsons graduate from here.  In fact, my oldest son, when he graduated, he was honored as the  Animal Science student of the year or something     What do you think it is about OSU that generates that connection, as far  as family members continuing to come to school here and people   s  fondness for the university?  I think it   s a friendly school.  More accustomed to the family feeling, I think. You know, I drive down  to the OU  University of Oklahoma  campus. I   ve got a grandson  graduated at OU campus. He   s down watching Texas play tomorrow but  there   s just no   it   s just kind of cold. It feels like to me     You don   t even know when you   re on campus down there.  No, and up here     You do.     you know you wave and people wave back to you and it   s a more  friendly atmosphere, more of a togetherness atmosphere   and I did like  those dance hours. (Laughter) Seven o   clock each night, wasn   t that  what time they were?  In the Animal Husbandry     14  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Neurohr  Sorority dance hours. I could make about three on two blocks, but     You were there in the     I enjoyed it.  Over there in the Animal Husbandry Department, we had teachers that  were concerned about our welfare and they wanted us to succeed. And a  lot of us did.  And that made a difference, didn   t it?  Yes, it did.     somebody   s away from home and, you know, up here trying to make  it. And it   s lonely enough, especially if you   re staying with some irate  old couple that won   t let you use their bathroom    (Laughter) but  certain times and paying them rent. It is very discouraging.  I   ve kind of been active in things since. Well, I served on the Diagnostic  Lab Advisory Board for twenty-seven years, and I guess I was President  of the Animal Science Alumni Association for thirty years. I try to stay  in touch, and I know a lot of the faculty still personally. It   s made for a  good life.  That   s good. Well, do you have any further stories or thoughts about the  campus or any of the buildings or anything like that that you   d like to  share with us this evening?  I   d hate to be a student now, this day and time, because it looks like, I  don   t know. I don   t know how these kids get around. I don   t know how  they   you know. It   s so big and everything has just grown and become  complicated. It looks like a complicated mess for me. I don   t know. I   d  hate to be a student up here now. But of course, I   m eighty-one years  old.  It   d be the same anywhere you   d go     Yes. If I were eighteen or nineteen, that may be right down my line, you  know. But the difference in your age and how you feel about it or what  your thoughts are, but it looks like a holy terror I would think. But these  kids seem to be making it all right. No problem.  Well, I think it   s remarkable that you were able to get the first rodeo  team started for OSU, and I   m sure that you must feel proud that it has  continued.  15  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Neurohr  Roberts  Meador  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Yes, we really are.  I miss our other members. I wish they were with us, but they   re gone so  you know, we just   we enjoyed it. And we usually meet once a year at  somebody   s house and have an overnight stay and a dinner or two and,  you know, just talk over old times. How many have we got left now,  three or four?  There   s four of us.  Four.  Who are the other people?  Clem McSpadden and Larry Kilgore. Harold Emery was one of us. He  died just a year ago. Bud Reger was a member. He died several years  ago.  And then George Rule. He competed with us. His son  John David Rule   runs the National Saddlery Company at the Stockyards in Oklahoma  City.  George was on that horse team     No, he wasn   t on   I don   t think he was on any of our teams, but   well,  if somebody was going, he went along and competed.  Let   s see. We went to OU one year after you left. They had a match deal  between OU and Oklahoma A M during the regular rodeo down there,  and they were supposed to give us belt buckles and they had bareback  riding, bulldogging and calf roping. We went down there and it was a  fouled-up affair. George was with us. I know I borrowed a dogging  horse and never did get a steer. I won the calf roping. Never did get a  buckle     I won a saddle at TCU  Texas Christian University  and never got a  saddle. He either lost my address or (Laughter)    and mailing  stuff   and George Rule and I went to TCU in    49 and I brought a  picture. Betty had an album, and I moved it or something the other day. I  was looking through some stuff and this picture fell out on the floor.  Well, face down. I turned it over and it was me bulldogging, Bud hazing  and the cruddiest old red steer. He looked like his hair was that long and  had lice all over it    (Laughter) and his eye, it looked like Jonah the  Whale, you know what that old eye looked like on the whale it was  watching   what was George Hinkle   s horse   s name?  16  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Blitz.  Blitz. We   d borrowed him.  Oh, boy.  And I was riding Blitz. But I placed in the bulldogging but I won calf  roping.  This old Blitz horse. I rodeoed RCA some and I was up in Topeka,  Kansas one year. This fellow, George Henkel from the Osage, he was a  character.  He was a clown.  Well, this horse he had   if you didn   t get down, he   d buck you off. You  couldn   t exercise him. All you could do was ride in that box and nod.  And nod. That   s what I did.  Yes. I was riding old James Bynum   s mare up there and he left. I still  had a steer to go. I said,    George, can I ride old Blitz?       Yeah.    Well, he  was in the calf roping, the first time I ever saw him rope a calf and he  stepped off this horse and broke his leg. The bone stuck out the side of  his leg. There I was with this old horse and no help, and I rode him in  the box and he just parked. Somebody said,    Leo, I   ve ridden that  horse.    I said,    You   d better back him up a few steps.    And I did, and  that was a mistake. I got out late and overtook this steer three fourths of  the way down the arena and I started down and old Blitz went the other  way.  Yes, he did me the same way.  So I just baled out. I didn   t want to stay up there and get bucked off.  (Laughter)  I did the same thing you   re talking about. That was the best chance. I  was going for my life. (Laughter)  Yes, save your life. (Laughter)     because he was going to buck if I did that     But that old horse, I guess they run a million steers.  Oh, probably did. Everybody in the country     17  Neurohr  Roberts  Neurohr  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Roberts  Meadors  Neurohr  Roberts  Were there any women on the teams that you were on, that competed at  all?  No, not then.  Were there women competing in rodeo during that time?  I   m sure there were barrel racers     Really, not on college teams. Barrel racing had just kind of got started.     pole bending     In fact, my wife was a barrel racer and a pole bender.  My granddaughter is a barrel racer. Angie. Have you met her? You   ve  probably seen her advertising Wrangler pants. That   s my granddaughter.  Oh, okay. Well, any last thoughts then?  Both nod their heads no ...  Well, this has really been enjoyable, and we thank you for participating  in our project, very much. Thank you, Mr. Roberts, and thank you, Mr.  Meadors.  Thank you. We appreciate it.  -------  -------
