 Gill  M. Pegues  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  My name is Jerry Gill. Today is October 18, 2008. I   m visiting Sam and  Myles Pegues in the Alumni Center on the Oklahoma State University  campus. This interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project for the  Oklahoma Oral History Program. Welcome Sam and Myles, we   re glad  to have you with us.  Thank you.  Thanks for having us.  Explain to us the relationship here now. You   ve got the same last name.  What   s the relationship?  This is my grandson.  This is my grandfather.  Okay, do you spend a lot of time together?  Yes. He   s really like my second father.  That   s wonderful. I want to start with you, Sam. I want to talk a little bit  about where you grew up, about your background and then how you got  to Oklahoma State University.  Okay.  Can you give us that story?  Yes, I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to wonderful parents, Patella  5  Gill  S.Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Latimer and Allen Pegues. I   m from a family of nine. Most of my  brothers and sisters graduated from Booker T. Washington High School.  We had a wonderful childhood. My graduation from Booker T.  Washington was on a Friday night ; my dad approached me on Saturday  morning. He said,    Son, you know you probably have three things you  can do. You need to tell me what you   re going to do by eight o   clock  tonight.    I said,    Okay, okay, Pops. I can do that.    He said,    I see you  doing one of three things. You can get a job  if you get a job and plan to  stay here you will pay for that luxury . You can enlist in the Army. Or  you can go to school.    I said,    Hmm, okay.     I went throughout the day thinking about this. And then about eight  o   clock at night I was back at the house and Dad hadn   t arrived, but the  phone rang. On the other end was my track coach Mr. Horace Johnson. I  said,    Hey, Mr. Johnson. How are you?    He said,    Oh, I   m fine Sam.     He says,    What are you doing?    I said,    Oh I   m just sitting here waiting  on my dad to come. I   ve got to make a decision for him probably in  about 20 minutes.    And he said,    Well Sam, I   ve got some good news.     I said    Oh.    He said,    Yes, I   ve got a full athletic scholarship to  Oklahoma State University. Do you want to go to school?    I said,    Yes   When do I leave?    (Laughter) So that was it.  Answer from heaven, wasn   t it?  It was an answer. That was actually my intro to Oklahoma State. The  track coach, Ralph Higgins, had evidently seen or heard about me and he  talked with Coach Johnson and he offered me a full ride.  Okay Sam, we   ve got to back up. You   re being a little modest. Tell us  about your track record in high school.  During my tenure at Booker T. Washington High School I was trying to  follow in the footsteps of my brothers, Allen Jr. and Julius Pegues. They  were All-Staters. Allen was probably the best athlete in the state. But at  that time  the school system was segregated . But he was the best. So we  were trying to follow in his footsteps. I started playing ball in the  seventh grade. I was on first string basketball and we played a little  football. In the eighth grade, my dad decided that I should go home and  wash dishes. My aunt lived across the street from Carver Junior High  School. She was a cateress and she cooked lunch for all of the teachers  at Carver. They came over at lunch time. So I had to go home  immediately after school and wash dishes and then go back to practice.  When I started that, the coach said to me,    It   s unfair. It   s unfair that we  play you when all of these guys have been here for practice the entire  time.    I was only twenty minutes late because I could really wash  dishes. But anyway, I kind of persevered. I didn   t quit the team. I just  6  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  kept going and eventually I graduated from Junior high School.  Unfortunately, when I moved to high school, that coach moved to high  school also. I had an experience in football that was tough for me to  swallow in that the coach was working with another player. That player  started at Oklahoma State at the same time I did. He was in football and  I was in track. But in working with the other player, he told him to do  something and he didn   t do it right. So he said,    Okay we   re going to  run it again.    So the next time, he kind of did it right, but he still didn   t  do it right. The guy who was on defense was standing there ready to eat  my lunch. So I did something different than the coach told me.  As I was  returning to the huddle  the coach was hitting the guy with a 2 X 4. I  took my helmet off and I said,    If you need to hit me with that 2 X 4 in  order to get me to understand what it is that you want me to do, I   m in  the wrong spot.     So ironically, it was that experience that led me to track. The next day in  class, I don   t know why we were out there high jumping over a rope, but  we were. I cleared six feet, doing the scissors. The track coach, Mr.  Johnson, just happened to be looking and he said,    My god     He came to  me and said,    Sam, I know you aren   t playing football. But you   re going  to run track.     That Spring  he took me out and he switched me from a  jumper that uses the scissors   that   s where you throw one leg up and  then you follow with the other one   and he switched me to Western roll.  I was able to go up like 6   6    and I held a lot of the state records at that  time in the high jump. I either won or tied, I never lost. Coach Higgins  got wind of that I guess and he offered me a full ride.  What year was this Sam?  That was 1956.  You   re senior year was?  1957.  You graduated in    57?  I graduated Spring semester    57. And that fall I started at Oklahoma  State University.  In 1957 how many African American students were enrolled at  Oklahoma State University?  At Oklahoma State University I remember one distinctly, and that   s my  wife Jo Ann. She was here. But the numbers were very low. I would  7  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  imagine there were approximately 20. We had to do lots of stuff for  ourselves. The culture was different. We didn   t really feel, and I   ll be  truthful with you right now, that we were accepted here. The state  legislature in 1957  mandated an open door policy which dictated to all  institutions of higher learning that the doors are open to  any and  everybody. Now my wife, she got in before that was done. When I came  in, the doors were open. But still   and later I   ll explain some of the  things that happened to me during my journey that I think toughened me  up, broadened my vision, and made me the kind of person that I am  today. I don   t dislike anybody, I don   t hate anybody. All that stuff is out  the door. I use acceptance as my key to my being healthy. I accept a lot  of things. If it   s something that I feel is negative, then I work to try to  change that. Isn   t that what Obama   s theme is?  Exactly. Sam let me ask you this, was Orlando Hazley there, were there  other black athletes on campus here at Oklahoma State at that time?  Mr. Orlando Hazley was the first black individual on the track team. I  don   t know if there were any other sports persons on any other teams. In  1957, let   s see, I was thinking I would name some of them. Orlando was  here, Pittman, football. Gordon, McFarland, Jones came in basketball.  Oliver Manuel had a scholarship.  James King didn   t come until about     James King came afterward. Yeah he came after us. But during that  period, Ray Bothwell, one of the discus throwers, Henry Bill.  Did you guys kind of hang out together?  Yes, birds of a feather flock together. They not only flock together  because they   re there, but they find comfort, solace, and there   s peace.  And you don   t have to fight stuff that you   ve confronted in your  hometown or wherever. Yes, we hung out. L.C. and I became real good  friends. He   s from Memphis, Tennessee. We just did a lot of things.  We, the group, did our own parties and we   d go down to the black  neighborhood and party. The fourth floor of the student union was our  meeting spot.  Your favorite hangout?  The fourth floor of the Student Union was our hangout spot. We would  go in this room and there was a juke box in there and we could play the  music we liked. We understood that the cowboy was the mascot for  Oklahoma State University. There was no way we were going to change  that. So we just went in there, dropped our quarters in the juke box,  8  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  played our music, danced, had a good time, and then went home.  Was there much interaction between the white athletes and black  athletes?  Yes sir. Yes sir. There was plenty of association for the guys who were  on the team. The team members understood that,    Hey, we   re out here to  win.    And if you   re good and you make your contribution, we will win.  So there wasn   t that animosity there. Now I was put in kind of a goofy  situation in that Coach Higgins always roomed me up with Aubrey  Dooley. You remember Aubrey right?  I sure do.  Aubrey was a good guy, but to me he had some feelings that weren   t  positive. An example was when we would go on trips. We would go to  hotels when we went north. And Aubrey would always be first in line to  get his key. He   d get his key, and he   d go up to the room, and I mean  this was every time. He would put his bags on the big bed. So I would  walk in and say,    Wait, wait, wait. We didn   t discuss how we were  going to do this bed thing.    I said,    Okay, if you   re going to get the big  bed we got to wrestle for it.    And I   d beat him every time, and then I   d  give him the big bed, and I would say,    That   s okay.    Now if I got to the  room first, I would always set my bag on the floor. My bag would just  set on the floor when he comes in I   d say,    Which bed do you want?     We arrived at one place. We got off the bus and went in to the hotel and  changed into track practice gear. Then we went over to the field house  warmed up and got all sweaty. He rushed back to the room and he turned  the water on in the tub. And I go,    Wait a minute, wait  Who   s water is  this in this tub?    So he said,    It   s mine, don   t you       So I just stuck my  foot in the tub, and don   t you know, he didn   t bathe. It   s okay  I   ve had  a number of experiences that I did not allow to get to me. I just accepted  and I said,    Hey, it   s all right. But I   ve got to change this bird.    And  Dooley was a good friend of mine. But it was just something that he was  brought up with and it wasn   t happening. The Graham brothers, a  wonderful relationship. Louis Mann. Metcalf, let   s see Grahams, I  already mentioned those, didn   t I. That   s not Alzheimer   s, it   s some-timers.  You said that your favorite hangout was on the fourth floor of the  Student Union. What were some of the favorite activities that you did in  groups? You said you made some of your social activities   what are  some of things you did together both on and off campus?  Well, I can talk about any of it. Whether you want to hear it or not is  9  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  something else. The social life was basically centered around little  dances. We   d get together and watch TV. A favorite pastime was to play  cards and some of us would play dominoes, and stuff like that.  Whenever the University put on something, we would attend. Other  fraternities and sororities never got invited. But it   s okay because we  were a happy together group. Times were tough, but you learned from  tough times.  I was talking to Ira Scott and he said,    You see, one of the things that  was tough was to find a date.    There were probably not that many  African American women on campus. He said they went to Langston.  Did you frequent the Langston campus?  Yes, we went to Langston, Oklahoma City and Tulsa. I thought you  were referring to activities on campus.  On weekends Langston always  has parties.  We   d hop in cars and run over there. I remember distinctly  that some of the guys tore up my car because they went to Oklahoma  City and I had some    may pop    tires that popped and they went off the  highway on one side and went across the highway to the other side and  just tore my car up. But anyway, it was just something that we probably  didn   t give that much thought to because if the university put something  on, we were welcome. We could go in there. And we   d meet up with the  guys on our teams and stuff. We rubbed shoulders just like it should be  and had fun.  You talked about your team, and you mentioned earlier about traveling  up north. Do you have any memories of traveling south?  Oh yeah.  Will you share some of those with us?  Orlando Hazley was the first black on the team and I came in right after  him. When we would go to the Texas Relays, all the white players went  up town and we went over to the    colored    part of town, and we   d get a  room over there. Well, I   m going to reveal this. Probably shouldn   t, but  I   m going to reveal it. What coach didn   t know was that he would  always tell us what time he was coming back to pick us up. Well,  Orlando and I had a friend in town who would pick us up, take us to his  house where we stayed. But Coach thought we were in a hotel. So when  he said he   d come by and pick us up, he said he   d pick us up at 2:15,  we   d be out there at 2:00 and we   d be standing there with our bags.  Orlando told me, he said,    Sam, I   m going to tell you about Texas.  Anytime you go south from Stillwater, you must always go, before you  go to party, somewhere and buy yourself a hamburger or two and take it  back to your room for breakfast the next morning.    Okay.  10  The next year Hazley didn   t go, so I   m by myself. I leave the room and I  go party. When I got finished partying I come back and oh man, I didn   t  buy my breakfast.  All the stores were closed.  Anyway they picked us  up early that morning and we started heading back to Stillwater. I was in  the car with Mack Delozier, Mack was a super guy. Mack was number  one. He got 50 stars behind his name from me because we stopped at a  place for breakfast. Coach Higgins met me at the door and said,    Sam,  you have to eat in the back.    Well I went to the back. I went to the back  but I knew I wasn   t going to eat. All the cooks in the back were black.  So they brought all the eggs, and all the bacon, and all the sausage and  set it at a table for me to get what I wanted. I said,    No, I   m not hungry.     They picked it up and they took it on outside. I got up and walked back  through the restaurant. I made sure I made eye contact with every person  as I made my exit. I kept repeating to myself,    And we   re supposed to  be a team.    I looked them dead in the face and I walked on out. They  picked me up when I was about two miles down the road from the place.  When I got in the car, all the guys attempted to say how sorry they were  that that happened to me. I cut them off and said,    Okay, I need to tell  you this, I   m not a very talkative person right now. The next person who  says anything to me, I   m coming over this seat and we   re going to fight  right here in this car.     So there was silence in the vehicle from that spot, all the way to Lawton,  Oklahoma, I think, when Mack pulled into this place to eat again. Mack  said,    I don   t want anyone to move and no one says anything.    I said,     Oh well, here we go again.    Mack got out of the car, he went in the  place. He said,    I   ve got a track team out in the car, and I want them to  eat. If they can all eat, we   ll come in. If they can   t we   re going to go to a  different spot.    Mack came back and he said,    Sam, you lead the line.     So everybody lined up behind me. We went in and ate, came out and  everything was well. The following week, Coach Higgins on the day  before we were supposed to go to the Big Eight meet in Kansas City  called me in his office and he said,    Sam, I need eight points from you.     Never mentioned what happened. He just said,    Sam, I figured it out. If  we can get eight points from you we can win the championship.    I said,     Coach, you   ve got it.    Now why did I do that? Why didn   t I explode on  him? I didn   t explode on Coach Higgins, because Coach Higgins was a  very   he was right on top. He was an excellent individual. But he got  put in the place. Somehow   I don   t know who arranged to go in that  restaurant, but evidently they   d been there before. So he   d just stopped  without giving it any thought, and so I wasn   t upset and angry at him.  Just like I   m not upset and angry with anybody today. It was an  experience that nobody would ever have to endure again, and that   s the  reason I   m back at Oklahoma State right now, to help Oklahoma State  get better. Because that   s what I   m about.  11  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Sam, I   ve got to ask you, did you get the eight points?  Yes, I did, I got him eight.  What about competition? Did you ever sense any of that prejudice in  your competition?  No  I never did. When people are engaged in competition, if you   re  thinking about whether a guy is black or white or an Indian, Chinese, or  Japanese, you   re not thinking about what you   re doing. It   s kind of like  golf. If you take your problems to the golf course, you   re not going to  play worth a darn. So, no, I did not. In the competition field, I did not  experience it one time.  Myles, let   s switch over to you for a minute.  Alright.  Myles, can you tell us a little bit about where you grew up? About your  background?  I   m from Denver, Colorado, born and raised. I lived for a spell with my  grandparents on and off, with my dad being a single parent. Growing up  we would come to Oklahoma once or twice a year to go to our farm. I  grew up just idolizing him, loving OSU, always wanting to go to OSU.  Barry Sanders was my favorite player, and still my favorite player in  life. So I really wanted always go to Oklahoma State. My friends would  ask me,    Why do you want to go to Oklahoma State?    I said,    Well,  that   s just something I have to do.    I got to high school and I played  football. I always wanted to play football. You know running back,  linebacker. I thought I was going to play. And to be truthful, I   m pretty  sure I could have played Division 1. But some things happened. My  coach came to me one day and said some things I believe he shouldn   t  have said. And you know, I really looked at it as a growing situation and  a growing point in my life where I said,    Is this going to be work? Or is  this going to be fun for me?     This is your high school coach?  Yes. Is this going to be work or is it going to be fun? I started for this  man for two years. As a sophomore I started for him, and the way he  came at me it really  made it seem as though  none of that ever  happened. So I decided to stop playing football. I knew it was going to  be a huge change, and it was. But then I transitioned. There was my  freshman football coach, who I was really close to, he came to me and  said,    You know, Myles you   re really talented. I   d like to see you try  12  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  something.    He didn   t tell me what it was at first. He said,    Come to this  meeting and see how you like it. Don   t say anything. I   m not going to  tell you what it is, I   m not going to go into details.    What it ended up  being was my introduction to DECA, which is business competitions. At  first, I was really skeptical because I was thinking,    This, I don   t get the  rush, I don   t know what I   m going to do in my free time.    But really it  ended up working out.  On my birthday, my grandfather got to see me excel in marketing  management and retail sales. I ended up placing seventeenth in State.  And it was a really weird feeling because I felt so low that summer to go  into conquering the world, it felt like. Doing something different. So  from that point on I really transitioned my life. I went to Shaw  University in Raleigh, North Carolina for a year so I could get my  grades to a point where I could get to OSU, where I could get in. I ended  up coming here my sophomore year. It was a beautiful thing. Every day,  I don   t take it for granted. It just feels like a dream almost.  What are you majoring in?  Business finance, now.  Business Finance.  Yes. I actually came in thinking I was going into broadcasting. I wanted  to be a DJ and then I thought it really wasn   t anything I was interested  in. So I changed to business finance.  Can you tell us a little bit about your matriculation into Oklahoma State  University and things you   re engaged in socially, and that sort of  fashion?  At first, we had some difficulties getting into the school because there  were some things we had to get over to get into the school. I had a 3.7  GPA coming from Shaw University, but they said because I didn   t have  24 transferable credits they weren   t going to let me in. Well, we ended  up working our way around that and it all ended up working out. I got in  I started meeting people and getting to know people that my  grandparents knew. They   ve really helped me get to know more people.  Doors opened up. Dr. Birdine was one of the first people I met when I  came here. Very good guy. Unfortunately, he   s not here anymore. But he  really helped me meet people that could help me go to levels that I never  dreamed of.  So pretty good social network, but also kind of support in terms of  academics.  13  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  Yes. When we first came we were talking to Anthony Walker of the  RISE Program, and he got me into that. He really understood where I  was coming from. I   m a transfer student. I   m new to this whole big  college thing. He really helped me transition. He said,    How are your  grades going? We   ll give you this money if you   ll pull your grades  together.    It really helped me push through that first year, because  honestly that first year, I don   t care where you go, it   s tough. It   s tough  that first year at a big school. It was a lot different than Shaw. The  culture was a lot different. I really didn   t understand what country was  until I got here, but I ended up liking it. And I   m vice president of HSA,  Hispanic Student Association. I   m on the design team for the Student  Union. Meeting Anthony Walker, Dr. Birdine, Dr. Figueroa has really  helped me become a great student.  Do you feel comfortable with the environment here now? Is it a pretty  accepting environment for     Yes, yes.  For black students, for African American students?  I believe it   s okay. It   s not where it could be. And that   s the thing, me  being on the design team, I   m really trying to help OSU get to the point  to where we are all more accepting. I come from Denver, Colorado.  Denver is very liberal. We have a lot of diversity and it   s a lot more than  this. But I think the sky   s the limit as to where OSU could be. We   re  trying to make those strides, but at the same time it   s not as fast as you  would want it to be. But sometimes things come slowly. So it   s good for  now, but I would say it   s just okay. Survivable but needs lots of work.  Now I   m going to ask you a question. Your granddad went and partied  some in Langston. Where do you guys party now?  The Reserves has a lot of parties in the apartments. There   s some  apartments out on Sixth, There   s some parties over in the community  apartments at OSU. They have parties and it just depends on where it is.  In the Ballroom sometimes. We   re really supportive of each other. In the  ICAE, Inclusion Center for Academic Excellence, all the groups have  opportunities to come together and talk about what is going on and  support each other. I really think that   s how the culture is developing.  With society changing in the U.S., I believe that we should be going the  same way.  We   re headed in the right direction, we just need to prod the  horse.  But we party all over. Not in the Hole in the Floor like he   d tell  you. (Laughter) We don   t do that anymore.  You think that more of the multi-cultural experience coming out of high  14  M. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  school and growing up makes it different coming to a major university  or let   s say Oklahoma State University now     Yeah. Coming from Shaw University, which is 99.5  black, to OSU,  that   s almost a cultural shock in itself. It   s a very enlightening  experience because you get to see the pros and cons of both sides. But I  think that Oklahoma State is trying to move forward because we have a  great international student presence. I think we   re trying to make great  strides. I would really like to see more students of diversity from  Kansas, Colorado, Mississippi, New Mexico, Arkansas coming from all  different places to attend OSU. To get here, be admitted, attend and  graduate from OSU. I think that would really help us make bigger  strides.  Sam, back to you, let me ask you, you talked a little bit about your  experience but not about the academic side. Your major here, and your  professors and what your relationship there was.  Well, it was hard, rough, and tough. When I came to Oklahoma State, I  enrolled in college. I was assigned an advisor. And that advisor enrolled  me in 21 hours   21 hours in architecture. So I went home because my  brother Julius is kind of a wiz. He   s just so smart he doesn   t know how  to tie his shoes. But he is very intelligent because he   s an aeronautical  engineer. I said,    Well, J. look at this schedule, what do you think?        Oh yeah, you can do it Sam.    Because I think he just glanced at it, he  really didn   t look at it. He said,    Yeah Sam, you can do it.    So I came  here thinking I could handle 21 hours as a first semester freshman in the  School of Engineering.  For one half of the semester, that was the toughest thing I had ever done  in my life. I was up in the morning at six. Down to breakfast by six-thirty,  on my way to class at eight, out of class at noon, back in class at  one. Then I had to go to Gallagher Hall and work an hour. I had to run  track practice for a couple of hours. After practice I would leave and go  to Bennett Hall   s athlete   s dining hall to eat. At 7:15, I   m on my way to  the library where I study until the library closes. I walk back to Bennett  Hall and go down to Lloyd Ramson   s room, he was tutoring me in  algebra and I   d stay up until 1:30. I   d get in bed about 2:00 and I was up  at 6:00.  So here   s the irony of the situation. The same person who gave me 21  hours   and this is what brought me to my senses at midterm. I had all     F   s but one. I came to the Student Union and I was getting on the  elevator to go upstairs. I didn   t come to the Student Union during the  week, it was only on weekends because I had to have a break. I was  getting on the elevator, and my advisor was getting off and he said three  15  Gill  S. Pegues  distinct words to me. He looked me in the eye and he said,    You still  here ?     I walked into the elevator and those words just kept bouncing  around in my head. Bouncing around in my head.    You still here? You  still here?    You   ve got to be kidding me  This guy   s my advisor. So I  went Monday morning and I dropped to twelve hours. Now I finished  that first semester with a 1.5 GPA. I can remember distinctly when I got  my grades. I went to a telephone booth. If that booth had not had the  holes that it had on the bottom it would have filled up with water up to  here. Because as I talked to my mom, I cried the whole time. She said,     Sam, let me tell you one thing. The line between sanity and insanity is  thinner than a piece of onion skin paper. Before you cross the line, you  come home because I love you as you are.    I have never forgotten that,  and it became my backbone:    Not all things are for all people    because  my mother says I love you as you are. Which is my way of translation,  acceptance. Just accept. Acceptance.  The transition into OSU was very difficult. It was very difficult but I  made it. And you asked did I have any help from my teammates. 85   of my team members were white. I   ve got to tell you emphatically, they  helped me. When nobody else would, my teammates would step up with  me. I had this experience. Some people would say, well this is cheating  but I didn   t view it that way. I had a teammate take a class, and in that  class they had us turn in synopsis of articles. Well, I don   t care how  many people read it, the results are going to be the same. So after he  finished he said,    Sam, you   re going to be required to do these 20  cards.    So he handed me his cards, all written in long hand in such a  fashion that I had a difficult time sometimes reading them. So I rewrote  them in my long hand. A card that he got an    A    on, my card came back  graded with a    C   . So I took the cards to Mack.  Can you tell us a little about your relations with Mack? How he worked  with the team?  Mack was a supporter of the track team in that he would drive us to track  meets, and when athletes came through here he would help Coach  Higgins, he would give them a job filling candy machines. He was over  the concession and vending operations at OSU. So I had like ten guys  working under me and he would give these guys jobs. So man, they  weren   t poor. They were poor  emphasis on poor . I mean they were     and just to show you how poor they were, my wife   s family lived out by  Wild Horse Creek. She would bring cakes up here and we had a dresser  that we set in this room that was downstairs in Bennett Hall and we  instructed all of the guys,    If you   re hungry, go to this room. The door is  open. Go to the chest of drawers. Eat some cake, eat some pie.    Now the  reason they did that was because it didn   t need refrigeration. So we talk  about it right now. I   ve got guys all over this nation that talk about that  16  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  chest of drawers. We kept one another alive. We looked out for one  another.  Did you have some professors along the way that you felt were  supportive of you?  I had some professors that really backed me. They would call me in.  They   d say,    Sam, come in and let   s talk.    I was in the School of  Journalism and Advertising. I had this to happen to me. This is up front  and if it happened it happened. The class was given an assignment. You  had to write a paper. Everybody agrees. As the class strolls out, the  instructor calls me aside and says,    Sam, I want you to write an  integration paper. Tell us how we can solve the segregation, integration  problem.    The theme of my paper was pointed in that direction, but  when I got down to the summary of it, I let that professor know that the  solution to the total problem is wrapped up in one word: Acceptance. If  you just accept me as a person or a man, like I accept you as a person,  why do we have a problem? I said that we have great men out there, top  men that represent the black race. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Martin Luther  King, Rev. Ralph Abernathy. We have all these guys out there. They   re  working on it. Now, if they can   t do it, what makes you think I can? So  that was the summation.  I had things like that that happened. But I didn   t hold it against those  people. The question that people used to ask all the time, what are you  guys going to do next? What are you going to do next? Newspapers:  What are you going to do next? Well, you did this, what are you going  to do next? All right. If I tell you what I   m going to do next, I give you  my plan and you set up roadblocks over here. Now if it was used a  different way it would have been different. But I got to the point where I  felt, no, I   m not telling you what I   m going to do. Because if I tell you,  you will set it up so that you can block it or make it more difficult to  obtain or change.  What did Mack Delozier say about    I want to go back to your question  about the cards? Remember where you handed in the cards.  All right. Mack told me this,    Sam, here   s what I want you to do, and  let   s just try this because this may be the solution to your problem.    He  said,    Take that stack of cards over to my secretary.    And I did. The  secretary typed the card up perfect. No grammatical mistakes or  anything. Perfect. Got an A the rest of the way. But the card reinforced  the idea that my mom instilled in my head: In this world, you   ve got to  be twice as good to get the same job. So I accepted that from my mom.  Then when Mack comes along   now I   m telling you that I   ve met some  people in my life, Jerry   Jerry you   re a great individual. But you don   t  17  Gill  S. Pegues  measure up to Mack. That   s basically because Mack was there all the  time; when I needed him, Mack was right there. When I didn   t need him,  Mack was right there. If I had a special problem and I needed someone  to talk to, I would go and talk to Mack. I called him Mack, but his name  was Henry Delozier. He was married to the daughter of President  Bennett for this institution. He was the fairest man that I have met that is  white.  We   ve got you through your OSU experiences, what did you do after  graduation? Can you bring us up to your life and your career?  Sure, sure. After I graduated here, I interviewed with Kroger Company.  They were looking for some management trainees and they hired me. I  went to Kansas City and I started working. I was there about a month.  They told me that I was on a two year management program. They  explained to me that I would go to produce, meats, and the groceries and  the cage in two years. That   s not too much, not too bad. You   ve got to  know a place before you can run it. So I agreed.  About a month and a half later, a guy comes from Texas. He goes  straight into the cage  Doesn   t have a minute in the store. He comes  from Texas University or somewhere. So I was inquisitive as to how it  was that he could bypass me. We   re trying to get to the same spot. If my  program is produce, meats, groceries and then the cage, then why is his  not. So I waited until the District Manager came. He came through and  he was talking to me about what a good job I was doing in the produce  department. I said,    Wait a minute, I   ve got a question to ask you. How  did Mr. X get into the cage when he came after me and I   m back here in  produce?    He said,    They didn   t tell you?    I said,    Didn   t tell me  what?       He   s on a two year program, you   re on a nine.    I said,    Wait a  minute, okay. Let me make sure I understand this. You expect that it will  take me nine years to learn how to run this store.    He said,    Well, that   s  the program you   re on.    I said    Well I need for you to do one thing for  me. I   m going to leave right now, and I   ll be back at one o   clock. I  would like you to have my check ready.    So I left and returned to  Stillwater.  I came back to Stillwater and went to the Journalism Department to talk  to some people and they said,    Well we want you to work on a master   s  degree.    I replied,    Well, what makes you think that if I got a master   s  degree in advertising, that somebody would hire me at a higher salary  than they could hire me now? I don   t understand it.    So anyway, I  decided that I would go back to school and get a teaching certificate.  When I finished my work on my teaching certificate, I came through the  Student Union and a buddy of mine, Ray Mitchell, was sitting up on the  fourth floor, had his suit and tie on. I asked,    Well, hey Mitch, what   s  18  Gill  S. Pegues  going on? What are you doing sitting up here today with a suit and tie  on?    He said,    I   ve got an interview with Denver at one o   clock.    Well  mind you, it   s about five minutes after twelve. I lived out in Student  Housing. I said    Ray, sit right there buddy, I   ll be right back.     I ran to student housing, took a shower, put my suit on and I came right  back. At about five minutes to one, Ray got up. He said,    Well, where  are you going, Pig?    He called me Pig. I said,    Ray, I want you to walk  into this interview and you don   t even know I   m behind you.    And he  did. He walked in and Finnis Ketchum was the guy who was  interviewing. Ray and I walked in and sit down. He said,    Who   s Mr.  Mitchell?    Ray said,    I   m Mr. Mitchell.    He said,    Well, who are you?     I said    I   m Sam Pegues, sir. And you have to excuse my presence  because I did not see the sheet to sign up to come and interview with  you, but I need a job. I   m probably going to be the best teacher you ever  run into in your life.    We talked. He hired me first. He laid down the  contract and signed me up right then. Then he gave Ray a contract. So  Ray and I went to Denver together. We drove there together, and that   s  how my teaching career started. I told Mr. Ketchum that I didn   t want an  elementary school job, but that   s where they placed me. I started at  Westwood, transferred to Cheltenham, then I went to Chadron State  because a friend of mine was there on a graduate assistant program and  they were looking for somebody to take his place.  Where was this?  At Chadron State College in Chadron, Nebraska. Well anyways he said,     Sam, I   m going to talk to Doc Colgate about you and he may be  contacting you.    Doc Colgate called me about two days later. He said,     Sam, how you doing?    I said,    I   m fine.    He said,    I see you   d like the  graduate assistantship.    I said    Sure.    So I planned a trip to Chadron and  went up there. All the way there across Wyoming and into Nebraska. I  thought, there   s no way I   m going to go up there. There   s no way.  Anyways, I got there, I met Doc. Drove all the way home and thought,  no way I   m going to go up there. My wife says,    Sam, there may be  something to this. If he offered you a graduate assistantship, he   s  probably going to see to it that you get your degree.    The light bulb  comes on so in August of that year I was to Chadron. I coached the track  team. I was assistant football coach, and I helped with other things and I  taught PE. Anyway, after getting my degree I came back to Denver. I  transferred from Cheltenham to Place Junior High. From junior high  school, I went to high school. Then I was the coordinator of physical  education for the whole district for one year. I then went to Thomas  Jefferson as Assistant Principal, the Athletic Director and that   s where I  retired. So I   ve had it good, man.  19  Gill  S. Pegues  M. Pegues  S. Pegues  How about your relationship through the years with Oklahoma State  University? Did you maintain contact with the university and people you  went to school with?  Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I compiled a list of all the people I went to school  with. I   ve got a list at the house of all the black students that were here  for the whole time I was here. I maintained contact because I joined the  Alumni Association, and thanks to you, I became a life member.  Everybody I see who attended OSU, every summer, every spring I start  calling people telling them,    Hey, put this date on your calendar, and  have you paid your dues to the Alumni Association?    I know one thing:  If you   re going to help or assist with change, you can   t be on the outside  of the shell. You   ve got to be inside of the shell where the yolk is.  Where the genes are. You   ve got to be inside and work inside out rather  than outside in. I   ve always encouraged all the people that I know to  come. We   ve been here I don   t know how many times   we come out  and play in the Black OSU tournament every year. I know that I   m not  going to win now   we won the first two years we came though   Haven   t won since.  From that time    til now, no. But I come because I try to encourage  people to take another look at the diversity issue. We   ve got more black  people on this campus, and things are getting better. And things are  going to continue to get better. They are going to get better because we  are progressing in the right direction. Because of guys like Myles.  Myles is here. I don   t know what his mission is. But he   s always talking  about his involvement with campus issues and that   s really encouraging  to me. This is my main man. I picked him up about a week after he was  born, I picked him up because  his Hispanic mother was going to put  him up for adoption . I told my son,    He   s not going to be adopted by  anybody. He   s going to be raised as a Pegues because he is a Pegues.     So I picked him up and I have been working with him ever since. I   ve  traveled extensively with Myles. We   ve been everywhere because I want  him to see how other people live. I want him to see the house on top of  the hill and I also want him to see the one that   s down here in the valley.  I want him to see the one that   s right here on Main Street, so that he can  see that there are things that you can get if you go in the right direction,  if you focus your education in the right direction. Keep your head  screwed on straight. You can be what you want to be because  opportunity will knock if you are ready.  The other day I told him, I was listening to these people talking about  the dream. Keeping the dream alive. I told him,    You know what we  need to do   we   ve been there. We   ve been through all the stuff that   s  been out here. We had an intellectual visionary man come in and go to  20  M. Pegues  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  the mountain top and give us the vision for the future. His dream, we   ve  made our dream and it   s now time to wake up. When you wake up from  your dream you   ve got to go and get it done. In this day and time, there  is an abundance of talk about change. There   s change. Obama   s talking  about it. McCain   s talking about it. Everybody   s talking about change.  We   re trying to change where we are and what   s happening to us. I walk  into Oklahoma State University and downstairs in the window of the  shop where you went.  Student Union.  In the Student Union. The theme of it is change. And they   re talking  about renovating this building to be today, the dream. They are talking  about dreaming of change. I tried to tell my man here and everybody  that I meet, we   ve got to wake up and work for change, because change  is going to be good for all of us.  Sam, I agree. One other thing. Do you recall when we created the OSU  Black Alumni Association under the umbrella of the OSU Alumni  Association? You were in some of those early discussions.  Yes.  Do you remember what some of our goals of that organization were?  Some of the things that we   ve done as alumni.  Well, yes. I think the goal had a pronged focus, because it addressed the  fact that, hey we need to expand. There are a lot of minorities coming  through here. They   re coming through here, but where are they? We  need to get those people back in via the Alumni Association. Get them  back and let them know what   s going on. It was a matter that we were  trying   like Bill Cosby says,    Eggs are a wonderful thing. Flour is  wonderful. Flavoring is wonderful. The ingredients of a cake.    He said,     They are probably all good when you see them as separate entities. But  if you mix them together, what do you have? You have a bouquet. And  the best flower arrangements you could ever have laid your eyes on are  not those of a single color. Yeah, we can get a bouquet of yellow flowers  and it will probably be pretty. But boy, once you start sticking some red  and some yellow and some green and some purple and some white and  put it all together, that   s what we   re shooting for.    And the OSU Alumni  Association, their goal was to get more involvement. More involvement.     Pull them together.    When you pull them together now, you   re talking  about two umbrellas, right? You got a big umbrella and you got a small  umbrella. And when you pull them together, you understand that we   re  under the same umbrella where everybody else is.  21  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Sam, a couple of things. I talked to some of the guys that had been here  and some of them still had some issues and concerns about their  experience at Oklahoma State University. We frankly discussed some of  those that weren   t as good as they should have been. At some points  OSU wasn   t as accepting and accommodating as it should have been.  But I remember Sam Combs saying,   Guys get over it. We all went to  Oklahoma State University. Our degrees are from Oklahoma State  University. We need to be part of the University.    Do you remember that  conversation?  I do. I do remember that. And Sam had the point that you could dwell on  that stuff that happened way back then just like I was saying that we   ve  been through it. Hey, we   ve been through it. There   s nothing you can  change about that  Wake up  Take a part   participate in what   s going on  today and make today better for tomorrow. When I came to Oklahoma  State with Myles, there were some things that were out there. And the  people who were attempting to help me, I had to let them know up front.  I   m not trying to get this particular problem squared away for Myles  only. I   m trying to get it squared away because there   s somebody else  out there that may be confronted with the same problem who many not  have the education or the intelligence to know how to resolve the  problem. If I can get the problem resolved right here, when that guy  comes along, he   s going to march in here and he may not need to know  where to go to get the answer because the answer has already been  provided to the person who is overseeing this particular aspect so that he  won   t have that bump in the road.  The answer or the opportunity, right?  Yes, that   s correct.  I   ll express my personal opinion that I   m really impressed with what  your leadership has brought together. If some of your focus hadn   t been  on students, on scholarships for students, on the social environment and  creating networks and support systems for those students, now there  different and hooking into the Oklahoma State University Alumni  network. OSU Alumni, OSU Black Alumni. I   ve been impressed about  how you guys have engaged students, particularly, and made that a part  of your mission.  Exactly. It   s the educational part that we   re trying to get. Education     we   re trying to open the door of wider opportunity to do things because  of our education. If we can get our education, we know that out there the  opportunities will exist for us, and we   re trying to open up those avenues  to opportunity. And with Myles, you know what we   re focusing in on? I  want him to get as much in his head as he can get and have as many  22  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  experiences as he can get, because this guy here is going to set up his  own business.  Myles, let   s go back to you for a bit.  All right.  Your grandfather   s generation and even the generation right in front of  you, they experienced a change in OSU and they helped make the  experience for those coming behind them even better. So how do you  feel   you were talking earlier about how the experience is good, but not  great; it could and needs to be better. How do you feel now, sort of  projecting for now what you could do, and then when you graduate and  move forward how could you make that experience good for people to  come?  I feel like everything I go through is a learning situation for me. When  young freshmen come through now I try to tell them,    Hey, look out for  this. Do this. Did you like this?    Because most of the times we don   t  understand when we   re going through something what the purpose is or  what the lesson is for. I try to make sure that everything I do is a lesson  towards somebody else. Even if it   s a mistake. You know more can learn  from that. And honestly, I looked at my grandfather. I looked at his  generation. I looked at every story he told me because he   s told me those  stories about a hundred times. (Laughter) I smile because I like them all.  I like them all as if I heard it for the first time.  But it   s my time now. It   s my time to take that torch. It   s my time to  start those stories and open the doors for other people. You know, I have  little brothers, little sisters, little cousins that I   m trying to get in their  head to come to Oklahoma State. You come to Oklahoma State and  doors will be open for you just because of your name. Just because of  who you are. Just because of what other people have done to get this far,  to get you here. So I   m trying to get in their heads. My little brother   s  four years old. I tell him,    Hey you   re going to go to Oklahoma State.  You   re going to be a Cowboy     because I really feel like OSU   s family.  I feel like when they come here for Homecoming, it   s just a regular  thing. It   s just a regular thing, they   re coming to see me and enjoy  everything that goes on, the festivities. So I believe that what we   re  doing is right and the only way we can do that is hold that torch high and  keep it moving. Hopefully one day we   ll have six generations, seven  generations, legacy students.  Connections for life.  Exactly.  23  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  S. Pegues  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Myles let me ask this and then I   ll get back to your grandpa. To this  point, you   ve just been a couple of years at Oklahoma State. What are  some of your favorite memories to this point? And I don   t mean recent  memories, but your favorite experiences at Oklahoma State.  First and foremost is the OSU football game. My first football game, to  see that crowd of orange, just to see Pistol Pete run around and see  Bullet. That was just a childhood dream being fulfilled, because it was  almost surreal, like I worked so hard and I finally made it. I   m finally  here. And then actually a very close thing which meant a lot to me was I  got to play in the Black Alumni Tournament yesterday.  The golf tournament     Yes.  To raise scholarship money?  Yes, with my grandparents and a cousin, Patrice Latimer. Just right there  with them and playing. And even being mentioned in the same sentence  as my grandparents, it   s just a dream.  So Patrice is your     That   s my cousin.  Cousin.  Yes.  Many relationships here.  That is my grandfather   s mother   s side of the family, the Latimer   s.  Your mother   s side.  Yes.  My mother   s brother   s son   s daughter.  Yes. Patrice was actually the first SGA president.  Student Body.  Yes, Student Body President. The first African American woman  Student Body President.  24  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  S. Pegues  M. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  I interviewed her yesterday.  Yes. Patrice, I love her to death. When we went to DC she told me some  things that passed the torch from her aspect, from her end of the  spectrum. So it   s just been almost like a prodigy coming up. You have  so many people telling you so many things about it and it really feels  that way.  I   ve got to ask you. Did you shoot a better score than your grandfather?  The match was a scramble format. I think we were just out there, we had  great family time. Great family experience.  It was a family experience.  Just experiences like this. I know I   ll remember it for the rest of my life.  That   s what it   s all about. And he   s had experiences like that.  Sam, your favorite memories at Oklahoma State. Looking back over the  years at Oklahoma State and your relationship with Oklahoma State  since, what are some special memories, special times for you?  Special memories. Well I   m going to tell you, and this is going to sound  kind of off the wall, but my favorite memories   every time I think of  Oklahoma State University I think of Mack Delozier. I talk about him all  the time. Because of my relationship with Mack, I always used to get  back to Stillwater, and I   d see him. Well, Mack, he got sick, and he  moved to somewhere in Tucson, Arizona with his son. I used to call him  all the time. Mack passed and my most devastating moment was that I  read about it in the OSU Alumni magazine. That was a low point for me.  That he was gone and I didn   t even know it.  We   re talking about highs though, right? I just had a good time at  Oklahoma State. Some people say,    Well how could you have a good  time when you had all these different things going on that quote and  unquote appear to be negative?    Man, you know, I accept that. I accept  those things. I say if that   s the way that person wants to be, that person  has to pay the price for that, not me. I wouldn   t stop talking to that  individual. I would just relate to them and let them see that I   m a good  person. Yeah, my skin is dark, but so what? I could also turn around and  say,    Well, yeah your skin is white, but so what?    I mean it was, so  what? So what? I loved to go to the football games and the basketball  games. My favorite sport while I was here should have been track, but it  was wrestling.  Yeah.  25  S. Pegues  M. Pegues  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  Myron Roderick. Joe James, what was his name?  And this was all before the turn of the century.  Hatta.  Tadaaki Hatta.  Yeah. Oh Yeah. I loved to go see that guy wrestle. I mean, it was a well  rounded experience for me. Had a few things that I didn   t particularly  care for, but that   s life.  Sam, give us some favorite sports memories. Some of your track  memories, some of your performances.  There was a guy down at OU, Mark Brady. Now in high school I only  competed against Mark in the state finals, and James Green; I beat those  guys. But Mark   s dad built him a high jump pit in his back yard or  something and he got to the point where he could jump seven feet, but  he never beat me. James Green was up there, he was up there high. But  he never beat me. Man that was just   I was a sprinter. I ran the hundred  and the 220. I broad jumped, I high jumped, I ran a leg of the 440 880  relay. I once ran in the mile relay and that almost killed me but when  we   d have a dual meet, I   d do it all. But my specialty was the high jump.  I got to run against Ira Murchison , Charlie Tidwell. I got to high jump  against John Thomas. John Thomas    runway was the same as mine. I  remember distinctly that I met the guy and I was talking to him and I  said,    John, why don   t you get out of the way.    I   m warming up okay.  I   m warming up at like 6   4   .    Man, why don   t you get out of the way.     He turned around and looked at me and said,    Well who are you?    I  said,    I   m Sam Pegues, Oklahoma State University; now get out of the  way.    I said,    Because when you start at 7 feet, I would have been gone  at 6   8.    But it was just stuff like that. I   m this way today. I razz people, I  needle them, I poke them   all in fun. All in fun. It just made it a more  memorable thing for me.  I received an honor   well let me talk about my family just a bit. My  brother Allen, he was good and they won the state high school  championship. No, the national at the time they didn   t let the people  come together. But for this tournament they brought them together and  they won the national. Ellie Hugh Latimer, Patrice   s dad, was the center;  my brother Allen Jr., was a guard. They won it all, okay. He was a heck  of a football player. He left high school, had some offers to go to school  from traditional black institutions but he decided to go play with the  Harlem Globetrotters. So he played with their farm club, that club that  gets beat all the time. Yeah, he played with those guys. Julius came  26  Gill  S. Pegues  M. Pegues  S. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  M. Pegues  Gill  along. Julius went to the University of Pittsburgh. He is in the Hall of  Fame at the University of Pittsburgh. The other night he was inducted  into the Historical Society of Tulsa   s Hall of Fame. Then I came along.  I came to Oklahoma State. I was inducted into the Hall of Fame at  Oklahoma State in track. My brother Luther went to Central Oklahoma  State. He   s in their Hall of Fame in basketball and he   s also in the Hall  of Fame of the Oklahoma Coaches Association. So you   re not just  dealing with some ordinary Joe   s here.  Or ordinary Pete   s here.  Yeah, so all of this inspiration. All of this that went along with us  becoming the people that we are came from the leadership and direction  from Allen and Patella Pegues. We try to pass it on. One of the things  that I pass on to this young man, whenever I do something for Myles, I  will say to him, you don   t have to pay me back. I tell you to do what?  Pass it on.  I say you don   t owe me. He   ll say,    What do I owe you Papa?    And I  say, you owe me nothing, just pass it on. Find some other person out  there, younger than you or the same age as you, and pass on the  knowledge that you have. Pass on your wisdom; pass on the stuff that   s  good. Because when you pass it on, you never know what that guy   s  going to do with it. If you tell him to pass it on and he does good, what  does that do? It causes the stream to flow.  What is this pass it on or pay it forward.  Yeah, pay it forward, very much so.  Is that influences of your grandparents, your family and your father, is  that important to you?  Oh, extremely, extremely. I mean I hold myself to, he wouldn   t say do  this, but I often find myself doing this. Seeing my Uncle Julius and my  late Uncle Allen, I feel like there   s been a gap between all that talent to  now. Not saying that my uncles and things, they didn   t do anything. But  saying that I want to get Pegues    status back up to what it was. I feel that  that   s my personal challenge. Not so much for people just knowing me,  but for me to be able to touch people   s lives and change things. I really  believe that there are people that watch things happen, there are people  that make things happen, and there are people who ask what happened.  Wonder what happened.  27  M. Pegues  Gill  S. Pegues  M. Pegues  Yeah, so I really want to be one of those movers and shakers.  Guys, this has been wonderful. We   re really thankful. Anything else that  we   ve left out that you would like to mention?  No, I think were in good shape.  Thank you very much.  -------  -------
