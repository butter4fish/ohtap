 Ahrberg and today is October 15, 2009. I   m visiting  with Georgia Kerby Laman in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This interview is  for the O-STATE Stories project of the Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program. Welcome, Georgia.  Thank you.  We   re glad to have you back on campus for the Women of Willard  Reunion, which we call    WOW.    We   re going to start off and I   m going  to have you tell me about your early life, where you grew up, your  family, your school and talk about your siblings.  Okay, I grew up on a farm in northern Oklahoma near the small town of  Deer Creek and went to a country one-room school for seven years and  then I went to Deer Creek, graduated from high school and then I came  to OSU. I had one sister. She came, but did not finish.  Were you one of the first people in your family to go to college? Did  your parents attend college?  No. No, my mother was really, really anxious for me to go because she  did not even finish high school. So my parents were very interested in  my getting an education.  What did your parents do for a living, may I ask?  Yes. My dad farmed and my mother helped.  What influenced you to attend OSU?  I was already enrolled at Northern Oklahoma Junior College which was  very small and then they had, I don   t know what they called it, Senior  5  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Day or something down here. You could come visit and when I did that,  I just had to come down here because I didn   t want to go to a small  school where everybody went home every weekend. So I just really  wanted to come here.  What year did you enroll then?  I was a freshman in 1955.  When you arrived on campus, what were you first impressions of the  campus itself and of the town of Stillwater?  Well it all looked pretty big to me because I had lived out on a farm, just  a small town. But I had been down here for 4-H Roundup and stuff like  that.  So you were active in 4-H when you were in high school.  Oh, for a few years and then I wasn   t. But since we lived on a farm,  we   d come down   it seems like we brought our chickens or something  once down here. So I was familiar with OSU.  What years did you live in Willard Hall?  All four years.  Were you assigned to Willard Hall or did you specifically request  Willard?  I think at that time we could request where we wanted to stay and my  sister was two years older and she stayed in Willard. I think there was  just something about Willard that     What were the other dorms? There was Stout and Murray.  There was Stout and Stout was considered the kind of sorority and then  Murray   I don   t know. It seems like a lot of people just ended up  in  Willard      Did you have a roommate or did they assign one for you?  They assigned one, but they sent out a little piece of paper asking about  your background and then they assigned me a roommate who was kind  of like me. She was raised on a farm and stuff.  What were your first impressions of Willard Hall when you first walked  6  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  into the dorm?  Oh, probably I just thought how big it was, you know. I don't recall ever  being frightened or anything like that. It was just big   someplace I   d  never been and they had an elevator, one of those old ones when they  scooted all the things back and, yeah, I just liked it.  What floor were you on?  Two.  What was your room like?  It was pretty plain, not too big. It did have a sink in it and a small closet  and a desk and a bed and that was it. And pipes running overhead where  you would hang all of your out-of-season clothes or your big skirts or  stuff like that.  Did you bring all your clothes for all four seasons up? Or did you have  to just bring up so many and then bring the rest later?  Actually, school didn   t start until the middle of September then, so I  probably brought what I would wear up until Christmas or something  like that because really I didn   t have that many clothes. My mother  would sew so if you needed something you kind of had to see what you  would need.  What was it like trying to have a personal conversation on the floor  phone?  Oh (laughs), it was not a very personal conversation with people running  back and forth and making faces and signs. They could tell who it was  and they would want to come listen in. Quite interesting.  Was the phone a pretty hot place? Was it ringing all the time?  It depends. If there was some big event going on, it would ring a lot and  there was one in the hall, but on the middle wing they had little tiny  rooms with a phone in them.  Were they pay phones?  No, just a little enclosure there where they had a little phone.  So did you use the phones to communicate with your folks or did you  write them, mostly?  7  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Wrote them mostly because that would be long distance and we really  did not call back and forth that often.  So you didn   t go home very much probably either?  Well, no. There were two or three people that went up there and  sometimes I would get a ride home. I do remember this one boy had no  heat in his car (laughter) and I particularly remember catching a ride, but  that   s what we did. We   d just find somebody. But no, I didn   t go home  all that often.  Tell us a little bit about the restroom area. Was there a common shower  on your floor? About how many women shared that facility?  Oh, well that was quite an interesting affair. I don   t know the exact  number, but there were probably four showers, maybe six stools, one  bathtub, which most people did not care to use the bathtub. I guess the  thing I remember most, because Willard was getting old you can look up  at the ceiling and see the wire that held the cement, mesh   whatever you  call it. The top of the shower was starting to crumble. Yeah, you   d stand  in line and you   d say,    Well holler when you   re out, I   m next for the  shower.     I guess Willard was an older building on campus when you were in it at  that time.  Yeah, it was.  How was the heat with no air conditioning? Was it hot and cold in the  rooms?  We would have fans, but because I did not have air conditioning where I  lived, it wasn   t that noticeable. You would open your windows and then  in the winter when they would finally turn the heat on all the pipes  would clank, clank, clank.  Was Willard, at the time that you were there, considered to be a popular  or prestigious hall?  We thought so. (Laughs)  Why would you say that?  Well because it was kind of then right at the center of the campus and it  was by Theta Pond and a lot went on at Theta Pond. It was right across  the street, kind of, from whatever the business one was; it was just in a  8  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  real central location.  It was the place to be, huh?  Well, I think so. We were quite proud that we lived there.  In your mind, what set Willard apart from other women   s halls in the  late 1950s?  We just thought it was higher class to be real honest about it. (Laughs)  Was the term    WOW    popularly used in the late 1950s?  No, I   d never heard us to referred to as that until somebody started  calling us that two or three weeks ago. (Laughter)  Well that is what everybody else has said, so it   s kind of interesting. I   d  like to discuss some of the    WOW    traditions with you. Do you recall  anything about the Willard Beach and where it took place?  Unless you   re talking about when we would crawl out somebody   s  window because we lived on the second floor and their room was over  kind of the porch and it must have been tar or something. So yes, we  would crawl out their windows and we would sun tan.  And that was on the south side, right? Or was it on the north side?  Well when I was a freshman, I lived in the main   so that went east and  west, yeah. So that would have been   I brought pictures of us sitting out  there.  Oh, I   d like to see them.  Oh yeah, I have them.  Did you all have Christmas traditions? Did you decorate a tree or sing  Christmas carols?  Always.  Did everybody just come downstairs at once? Or was it by floors?  No, I don   t remember that so much because what I thought you were  talking about was the parties we had in our room all the time.  Well tell us about those. Were these Christmas parties?  9  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Oh, we had parties for any occasion you can imagine. Mainly it started, I  think, I was in the middle and then when I was a sophomore, I moved to  the west wing and then we really did have a lot of parties. Halloween  parties, popcorn parties, or somebody would feel like they were  neglected, so they would have a party for them. We just had parties for  everything.  Were they mainly during the week or did you have them on the weekend?  No, we would have them during the week. Something else I brought  were some of our parties. I had an invitation and the party started at  10:30 which, you know, you   re supposed to study from eight to ten. That  was quiet hours. So then you would have your party after that.  And so you cooked popcorn and drank soda pop?  Yes.  That   s what you did? And then everyone would hear about the parties  and come down the room, right?  Yeah, sometimes you would get an invitation. Sometimes it would be a  surprise party for somebody and things like that.  How many girls could you get in a room like that, you think?  Quite a number. That   s another picture I brought. I would guess there  could have been twenty in there.  Really? Did Willard participate in Homecoming events or contests?  You know, I can   t say that we did so much, but that might be an area I  just don   t remember that well. But most of the contests I remember  revolved around sports, you know, intramurals.  So you all had pretty good teams going?  Well, we thought we had pretty good teams, but I think the fourth floor  were P.E. majors so it was always a running contest with the P.E. majors  on whatever floor they were on. I remember some of those. It was really  a lot of fun.  Did you play other dorms, is that how it worked?  Well they might have had a championship occasionally, but we would  do some of that.  10  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Did they make t-shirts like they do for events now?  No, I doubt if any of us could afford a special t-shirt.  So they just maybe put on a tee or something. Was there a number?  No.  Not even that. You just knew.  But somebody may tell you that we had shirts and I don   t remember, but  no, we just got out and played volleyball or basketball.  Did you participate?  Oh yeah, I loved it.  Did you do all the sports?  No, I did basketball and volleyball and softball some.  What happened when a WOW member became engaged?  We   d have big showers for them.  You would?  Yes and those we could even have down in one of the rooms in Willard.  I don   t know if they still do, but they had little parlors and you could go  down there and have showers.  Bring the gifts and stuff?  Yes.  That   s cool. Do you remember anything about the dorm scrapbooks?  No, just my own. (Laughs)  Do you remember or did you hear about the 1955 panty raid? What did  you hear about it? Did it leave an impression on you?  Just that they had one. It didn   t amount to very much. (Laughter) It  wasn   t as exciting as people made it out to be.  Do you know what caused it? Was there an event on campus?  11  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Yeah, but I can   t remember what it was. But I think it was the only one  that we ever had, that I know about.  What were the resident hall hours when you were on campus?  Well, quiet hour was eight to ten and I think we had to be in by 10:30 at  least and then they would come around and have room check.  Did they knock on your door?  Oh, yeah. They came in physically to check and see if you were there.  Were you all issued a key?  Yes, we had a key.  In your own rooms, you had keys, too? You could lock your room when  you left. Did they lock rooms back then?  Yeah, but we didn   t have a key to the dorm. If you were late, you had to  ring a bell and then the house mother would come out and greet you.  Which leads me to some of my other questions. Do you remember much  about your dorm mom?  I think her name was Mrs. White. She was a nice lady.  And you had one during the day and one during the evening?  I can   t remember that, but up on every floor we had proctors and they  had a room and they were supposed to kind of mentor us and do things  like that.  Was there a dress code at Willard?  I think there was. It seems like we had to wear skirts and look halfway  decent when we   d go to meals and stuff like that. (Laughs)  Were there any penalties for coming in late past curfew? Did you ever  come in past curfew?  I guess I was just too chicken to not be there on the right time, but yeah  they would certainly talk to you about it. I think I was such a chicken, I  would have been scared to death for them to talk to me.  What public display of affection, or was PDA a serious infraction at  12  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  your dorm?  Well it was frowned on. There was a couple that everybody knew. They  didn   t have a car, so they couldn   t go out and park like  the rest of us   (laughter) so they did all theirs right in the hallway and we   d come in  and,    Ugh.     But they never got in trouble?  Well I guess they really didn   t do that much.  And they weren   t actually in the dorm itself.  Well yeah, because you   d walk up the stairs and there was this   and  they would stand there. A lot of people would be standing right there  and then when the ten o   clock or 10:30 thing went then you   d rush in the  door. (Laughter)  What were some of the special hall events and activities that you  remember? Dances? You talked about some showers.  Yeah, they had, what was it called? Monday night dance or something?  Willard Dance Hall and you   d go down there and dance with whoever  came from some other     Was it open to everybody?  Yeah, I think, pretty much.  So it wasn   t for a particular men   s dorm or anything like that.  No, as far as I know, it was just whoever wanted to come.  Did you have a live band?  No.  You   d play records?  Probably records, yeah. It was just called    Dance Hour    and you   d go  down there.  Okay, I assume it was chaperoned.  I   m sure it was. (Laughs) Everything was chaperoned.  13  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Some of the things that you   ve brought forth, are there any special  memories, an event that particularly stands out while you were at  Willard? You talked about the parties, but was there a particular party  in general that may have left an impression on you?  No, but what left one of the bigger impressions was because they had a  television downstairs and that was when Elvis was on the Ed Sullivan  hour. So I remember going home one weekend and we didn   t have a TV,  so I had to find somebody that was going to get back in time so I could  see Elvis Presley on the Ed Sullivan show and that was when they only  showed him from the waist up. (Laughter) Yeah, so that kind of made a  big impression on me.  So did you enjoy Elvis Presley music? Rock and roll was just sort of  coming in.  Oh, yes. I still like it.  So that was the music you all listened to when you danced?  Yes, and some of us had record players and you   d turn it up as loud as  you can. I tended to like to play the same song over and over again and I  think my roommate would sometimes tell me to turn it off   Was there a particular Elvis song that you really liked that you  remember? That really stood out?    Jailhouse Rock?     No, I remember    Love Me Tender,    it wasn   t really rock and roll. And     Blue Suede Shoes,    some of those. But that was also when Johnny  Cash was just getting popular.  It   s kind of interesting to talk about the music. There was such a western  influence on our campus. Did the women in Willard mix with the  cowboys? Were there a lot of women that dated     Well yeah, because they   d have Western Week and because a lot of us  came from the country, a lot of the boys would be from, or they knew  them from 4-H or something like that. So yeah, we   d have Western  Week and you   d wear jeans.  Did they have the Rodeo Club back then?  I think they did, yeah.  Those were some special memories. Were there any tough times for you  while you were at Willard? Was there something that you recall that was  14  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  negative?  About Willard?  About Willard or an experience that you had that was kind of a bitter  memory for you at all?  No, I can   t say that I really had any bitter memories. Just an art teacher  that drove me nuts because she was kind of a funny old lady. We were  out there in those Quonset huts, which you don   t know a thing about,  and she was so picky about everything you did. I just remember coming  back to lunch almost in tears because I couldn   t do something that quite  pleased her. But no, I didn   t have any bitter memories.  So she was a professor that stood out that you recall. What was your  major?  Elementary education. So, we did a lot of other stuff.  Was there a professor that you really liked?  Valerie Colvin. She taught P.E. She would get summer jobs for girls.  They would go down to a Girl Scout camp down in Conroe, Texas.  So she taught you classes.  Yeah, P.E. She taught P.E. classes and if you were an elementary  education major, you had more of an opportunity to take more classes  like that.  Do you recall any kind of diversity in Willard? Were there any ethnic or  international students that lived in the dorm?  I know we had one black girl and she was just the nicest person. In fact,  that was the first time I had ever had anything to do with black people.  There really wasn   t too much.  But everybody was very accepting of her?  Oh, yeah. They were.  At dinner, everybody would sit at the table with her.  Oh, yeah. I can   t recall anybody ever thinking that she wasn   t just like  we were.  15  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Were you active in the Willard or OSU women   s residential hall  associations? Did you hold a hall or floor position?  I think I was sports chairman once. (Laughs)  Did you work in the hall?  I did. I sat downstairs and would take telephone calls and stuff like that  and put up the mail and then I ran the elevator.  How much did they pay you?  Very little. I don   t even remember how much it was.  Do you remember how many hours you worked?  Yeah, it seemed like maybe ten or fifteen a week. I don   t remember  exactly.  Was that hard for you to do that and go to class?  Not really.  Can you tell us why the women of Willard have stayed so close through  the years and continued to have reunions even fifty years later?  Well I always considered myself very lucky because I moved into a  dorm and right across were these girls from little bitty towns, lived on  farms, and a lot of us went to the Wesley Foundation. None of us really  had boyfriends or anything and so we just kind of started going to the  Wesley Foundation and including anybody around there. I think that was  what a lot of it was. We just were all from the same background. I   d go  home with them and they   d go home with me. I just was very lucky that  it worked out that way.  Do you think this particular bond that you have is unique to Willard?  Have you heard anything of Stout or Murray having this particular  bond?  No, I don   t think so because people I   ve talked to, they say,    Oh, that is  just so great. You have stayed together all these years.    I guess we just  liked each other so well.  I figured it was those popcorn parties. (Laughter)  Yeah, we know too much about each other  (Laughter)  16  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  How many reunions have you participated in and where?  I think the first one was Quartz Mountain and then there was one at  Western Hills Lodge and then they had a few that I did not attend for  one reason or the other. I think I   ve been to four or five of them and then  the one in Oklahoma City that was just about three years ago.  When Willard was converted to administrative use, was that  controversial with some of the women of Willard?  I don   t think so. I think we hated to think it wouldn   t be a dorm, but it  really did need fixing up, so.  Did the WOW group participate in the renovation plans of Willard? Did  they lobby for maintaining the original room spaces on the first floor?  I don   t know that they lobbied. But if we could have, I   m sure we  probably said something.  Have you had a chance to see the new residence halls at OSU? And if  you have, do you have an opinion about them?  Yes, because we   ve had our grandkids up here twice for Grandparents  University and I just thought,    Oh, my goodness   luxury.    They have  no idea. But I think you miss some of the close connection.  Because of the way they   re arranged?  Yeah, and it is fifty years later, but yeah, they   re nice. They really are.  I   m going to ask you some transition questions here about your general  OSU experience. What year did you graduate?  1959.  During the time that you were on campus, OSU changed its name from  Oklahoma A M and joined the Big 8 Conference and became the  Cowboys. Do you recall how the students generally reacted to that?  As far as I know, there wasn   t too much dissension. I always thought it  was kind of neat. I went to A M two years and OSU two. (Laughs)  And you said some of the classes that you especially remembered were  an art class and you mentioned two professors and you liked, I guess  you liked the P.E. classes.  17  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Yeah, I liked that. But I did have an art class that I really, really liked. It  was for elementary education majors and I cannot think of what the  lady   s name was. I remember I made a big macram   duck and I  remember my future husband said,    What in the world did you make  that for?    I don   t have any idea but we had to do a project.  Were most of the professors that you had women or men?  I   d guess it was 50/50. Because I had the Marsdens and they were man  and wife, but they were both in education.  Tell us a little bit about the library. The library was a fairly new  building on campus along with the Student Union. Can you tell us a little  bit about those buildings and in terms of visiting them, did you go to the  library often?  Yes, we would go because generally what would happen, you   d go and  study a little bit. Then lots of times you   d go over to the Union then and  have a snack afterwards and dance or something like that.  So when you wanted to study for an exam or anything, did you go to the  library or did you stay in your dorm? Or go to the Union?  No, I never studied in the Union. I studied in my dorm room, but we had  a lot of papers to write and readings. You had to look up these readings  and stuff. So that was done in the  library .  Did they have any kind of resources for you to use there at Willard for  your school work?  No.  So you had to go to the library or buy them with your books.  Yeah.  What were some of the popular student hangouts that you went to on  campus or off campus?  Well the Union was one of the most popular and then they opened the  Hideaway and it was brand new. I had never had pizza until I came to  school down here, so I do remember when they started the Hideaway  and then we would go to the drugstore on Campus Corner.  Swim   s?  18  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Yeah.  There was a place called the Y-Hut. Was that there when you were  there? Was it a coffee shop on campus, the Y-Hut?  The name rings a bell, but I can   t say that I ever went there.  So how did you feel about pizza?  Oh, I loved it. (Laughter) Yeah, I love it. And since I live in Oklahoma  City and it   s in Oklahoma City, I can say,    Oh yes, I was at OSU when  they started Hideaway Pizza.     President Willham was president when you were there, can you  remember anything particular about him as a president?  No.  He didn   t stand out?  No.  Did you see him on campus much?  Yeah, you   d see him some, but mostly you   d read about him in the  newspaper.  Did you attend many of the athletic events?  All the basketball games, because then they were free and it was  odd/even. So if I had odd I   d try to find somebody that had even so I  could go to all of them. The one I remember most was when we beat  KU.  Was Henry Iba the coach then?  Yes, and Wilt Chamberlain was     Oh, that   s right. That game.  I remember where I sat and everything because we always stood up in  one corner.  In the    50s, the campus was pretty quiet politically. There weren   t any  big movements on campus. It was before the Vietnam War.  19  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  I don   t remember very many big movements at all.  Everything was just kind of calm.  I guess. (Laughter)  You were having a good time at Willard.  I guess. It was such a good time to me. I just had a good time at Willard.  Can you share some of your highlights of your life after leaving OSU?  And where are you currently living?  I left OSU and got a job teaching in Oklahoma City and I have been  there ever since. And of course, then when my husband graduated a  semester later, he moved down there and we   ve been there ever since.  You met your husband here at OSU?  Yes. He was driving down the street because my roommate   she was  with me and we were going to the infirmary, but her boyfriend was in  the car with him. They stopped and we went downtown and so my  husband always said he picked me up.  (Laughter) How cute.  So yeah, I met him here.  Was he from Oklahoma?  He originally was. But he was older. He had been in the Army and he  had also lived in California several years, but he came back here to go to  college when he got out of the Army.  How long have you all been married?  Fifty years this December.  Congratulations.  Thank you.  Is there anything else that you would like to share about your experience  here at OSU or at Willard, something that you recall or that stands out?  Not too much. One thing, you talked about when they renovated  20  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Ahrberg  Laman  Willard, they contacted me because they were trying to find people  that   actually what they were trying to do was find people that would  donate money to help pay for it. So we contacted a lot of our friends and  a lot of the WOW people and we collected money and have a plaque  over there. We came up, I don   t know if it was a football game weekend,  anyway we came up one time, had a little reunion and they dedicated  that plaque. We can walk over there now, for our two friends that     Are you able to come back to OSU often? Or come down for  Homecoming or to see your grandchildren?  Yeah, I don   t come very much for Homecoming. Both of my kids  graduated from here so we came back and forth a lot then. We don   t  come so much, but we always try to go to the OSU basketball games  when they   re in Oklahoma City. We like to do that. But yeah, we  brought our grandkids up here twice for Grandparent University. That   s  really good because then you wear the t-shirts and people say,    I   ve  never heard of anything like that.     Have you seen the campus change a lot since the    50s? I know there   s a  lot of new buildings and everything, but just the overall feeling of the  campus, does it still have the same feeling when you walk across it?  It does to me. And, you know, when I walk in the Student Union, it still  smells just like it did on those stairs. I mean it   s not a bad smell, it just  smells exactly like it did. And then you walk by the buildings where you  used to take P.E. classes and those have been changed now, but I still  think it   s the prettiest campus.  Did you ever travel to the out of town games to go to the sporting  events?  We went once, I think, to Norman to the OSU-OU basketball game, but  we didn   t travel otherwise.  It was very hard, probably. Well I think this about concludes our  interview unless you have anything else you want to add. I just want to  say how much I enjoyed interviewing you and I   m so glad you   re here.  Oh, I am too.  It   s just been a real pleasure to meet you and talk to you about your  experience.  Well thank you. It   s been really neat that you   ll do this, I think.  21  Ahrberg  Laman  Well thank you very much.  Thank you.  -------  -------
