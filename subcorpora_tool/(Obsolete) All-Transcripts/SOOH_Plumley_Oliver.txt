 Anderson, and I am here with Oliver Plumley at the  Oklahoma State University Library on March 29, 2013, to discuss his  life as a Native American artist. Oliver, where were you born, and  where did you grow up?  Plumley I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by way of Claremore Indian Hospital.  My mother needed a C-section, and Claremore said,    No, we couldn   t  do nothing.    I was tooken to Saint Francis and popped out on July 24. I  grew up in Red Rock, Oklahoma. It   s been the home of the Otoe-  Missouria Tribe since 1880-something, since their removal, not  removal, but they sold their land at the Big Blue Reservation in  Nebraska and moved to Indian Territory.  Anderson Red Rock is where you spent most of your life growing up?  Plumley Yes. I spent most of my life growing up until   I think I   ve been away  from there a few years after high school, and then a few years in the  military, and about four years away while I was at the University of  Oklahoma.  Anderson Okay, what were some of the things you did as a child?  Plumley Some of the things I did as a child, we just, we played. We ran around.  We always had a thing about, my parents always told me about being  home before dark, before street light. We would just run around and  ride bikes, play, some traditional stuff. I know when we had different  powwows and different dances, I would go with my parents to there.  There were sometimes I   d sit and listen, and sometimes I would go and  play. There was kind of a balance between being a kid with the same  time sitting down, listening, and paying attention, knowing that in  future years, I didn   t really realize it. Later on in life I realized, you  know, they try to have a balance between playing time and having fun  5  and actually sitting there listening to the songs, listening to the singing  and things like that.  Anderson Right, so you normally played with friends, or did you have siblings?  Plumley I was the youngest child, but I   m the only one between my parents. My  dad   s first wife, they had split a long time ago. My three siblings from  their marriage was out married, had kids already. My mom   s children,  they were older, about to graduate when I came in the picture, so I was  the only child at home even though I had a bunch of half-brothers and  sister. Most of the time I played with friends and cousins, or distant  cousins or something like that. We all lived on the same block or same  part of town.  Anderson How do you think growing up in a primarily Native community  impacted your life?  Plumley Well, the community was a mixture of Native and non-Native (we  would say Caucasian and whites). It was probably a good fifty-fifty  split down the middle. Sometimes it would be sixty-forty Native.  Sometimes it would be forty-sixty Caucasians. It just depends. There   s  a lot of sense of community. I know I could go and play with some of  my friends, and then at the same time when their folks had something to  eat, you know, I   d always get invited to eat and stuff like that. It wasn   t  to where,    You   re not our kid. Go home.    It was a more sense of  community. I knew that.  At the same time, my parents weren   t around when I would go run  around, but at the same time, I know there was other people there that  was watching. If I get in trouble, I get in trouble by them. Then they tell  my parents. When I get home, I got in trouble again. (Laughter) It was a  pretty good little community that we grew up and we knew each other.  We knew each other if you were relatives or if you were friends, or just  that young lifestyle. At the same time, we knew that every year we  would go dance at our annual encampment and see relatives or friends  that their folks and parents would only come in once a year in the  summer for the annual encampment.  Anderson What is the annual encampment?  Plumley Annual encampment is held every third weekend in July where the tribe  gathers and has four days of dancing. A lot of the traditional songs are  sung. Dancing, they have some more contest dancing now, but this is a  time where the Otoe people camped. They would make their  encampments. Everyone would bring in their tents, bring in their shades  and arbors and stuff. People will cook all four days, even five days.  6  They will move in. There would be the oldest buffalo clan member or  the one who was deemed the leader. The head of the buffalo clan would  make a journey from their house to the grounds the Sunday before the  festivities started. They will be the first ones to move in, so they will  come in, bless the ground and bless the ground in the dance arena. Then  they were allowed to be the first one to move in, then followed by the  chairmen and other council members. That tradition is still going on  today, as we speak.  I know an older lady. I call her Grandma. Since she   s an older lady, we  just call her Grandma. Rosetta LeClair, she was an Arkeketa. Her  maiden name   s Arkeketa. She   s from the buffalo clan. I remember one  day my dad was telling me that she walked from her house, just on the  outside of White Eagle, east side of White Eagle   which White Eagle  is about eight miles north, just right across the Arkansas River to the  North side of the Otoes. She walked. She got up early in the morning  and walked on the side of the highway with her husband behind her.  Walked all the way and went all the way into the dance arena where it  was, just on the north side of the Red Rock Creek, a little off of  Highway 177, the northeast part away from Red Rock off Highway 177.  She walked all that way to continue that tradition.  They would have the dance and have the annual encampment for four  days. Usually Wednesday, they would have a mourners feast. They  would feed those who were mourning so they   d be able to participate.  Then Thursday, all the new kids come in, all the ones who their parents  want to bring them into the arena, so they will have those ceremonies of  putting a plume on a girl or a brooch on a boy and take them around the  arena, telling them about they   re walking the footsteps of those who   ve  gone on there. Even those who won   t be paid to sing at the center drum,  they will be brought in at the same time, as well. People will have what  we call specials or giveaways. We   re paying for certain positions, or  we   re paying for our children to be part of the arena. Someone who  wants to come back into the arena after a yearlong of mourning, they  have the opportunity Thursday to do all that.  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday is the dancing, Friday, Saturday, and  Sunday afternoons. Since the Kiowa people came up and gave the  Gourd Dance to the Otoes in probably in the 1910s, 1920s, every year  they   ve got a Kiowa head singer. They would sing Gourd Dance songs  until the evening when the traditional, an Otoe singer, someone who  knows Otoe songs would come out and be the evening singer, and all  the different dances will go on. Most of our songs talk about war, talk  about times of peace, times of battles and things like that, telling our  history of things that have gone on. It   s the time, as a kid, when you go  and play and have fun. At the same time, there   d be times we had to sit  7  there up front next to our parents and watch. Some of us, we would  dress out and Gourd Dance or dance. This was the first time that we got  exposed to some of our traditions.  Anderson Were there people in your life that sparked your interest in becoming an  artist?  Plumley I know my grandpa, not my dad   s real dad, my dad   s adopted dad, even  though that was his uncle   his dad and his uncle had the same mother  but different fathers. My dad   s grandmother came back from the Ioway  Tribe back to the Otoe tribe. She had my grandpa and his uncle. His  older brother took him as one of their own and gave him his name. My  dad was raised by his uncle. His uncle was named Oliver, as well, so  that   s who I was named after. I never met him, but I heard tapes and  cassettes of him singing peyote songs and Native American church  songs that had Otoe words in it. I know my dad would sing a little bit,  so that   s kind of my first connection, as far as with my dad.  Then, there would be other singers that I would hear at the drum.  Richard Roubedeaux was a singer that I talked with. Don Patterson was  another singer. I remember hearing Johnny Kemble, and even his  nephew Jimmy Kemble. They were Poncas, but they knew a lot of  songs. My dad, he was raised by   his uncle and his wife, Suzette, was  Ponca. My dad grew up in Ponca. Everyone thought he was Ponca until  later on in life they realized,    No, you   re Otoe.    Oliver and Suzette  didn   t tell him. His cousins all told him,    You   re adopted.    We would  always go up to White Eagle  Park  to their dance pavilion or to their  cultural center to where I was listening to Ponca singers, and then at the  same time listening to Otoe singers. A lot of good songs. I remember  hearing some of, even when I was a kid, hearing Harry Buffalohead. He  was a really great singer and composer of songs.  Then even when we   d go down to Carnegie to the Kiowa   my mom,  her mother remarried a Kiowa. He was a Kiowa medicine man. His  cousins were from the Cozad family. There were a lot of good singers.  Old Man Cozad, Leonard Cozad Sr. Sticking to the Kiowa ways, he  married just one woman, and had about nine or ten kids. She passed  away, so in Kiowa tradition, he married her sister and had another nine  or ten kids. There   s a lot of Cozads. They would all come together and  sing and have some very, very beautiful songs. Listening to him and  listening to Leonard Cozad Jr. Him and my dad were really good  friends, so just listening to them singing. Some of these older singers  that some have gone on and some are still around, but just getting that  influence of sitting at the drum and singing in how the proper way of  conducting yourself around there was pretty critical. Just learning that,  respecting the singers, respecting the drum, respecting the songs.  8  Anderson Do you remember the first time you sang?  Plumley I think I was twelve or thirteen. I started a interest. I was singing a little  bit through school but not a whole lot. I know that when I really started  singing, my dad got me a little-bitty drum. Unfortunately, I lost it. It   s  kind of like if I wasn   t meant to have it at this certain point in life, I was  meant to have it earlier but maybe not later. It may come back to me. It  may not. I   m hoping someone is using it right now. He got this little  drum for me, and I would just sit in my room and sing songs, and  practicing hitting the drum and keeping that timing.  People hear it as just yelling or something, but there   s melodies in it,  what we call vocables. There   s not really words, but you   re singing a  melody. I can compare it to when we   re teaching, like a music teacher  teaching someone how to sing,    Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do.    You have  those type of syllables. Well, there is very certain syllables in our  Native singing kind of similar to that, not necessarily but you   re able to  carry a tune with it, have that melody, so a lot of part of the song is that  melody.  Anderson Many people haven   t ever heard of your form of art before. Can you tell  me a little bit about what you do?  Plumley I   ve always sang traditional songs as far as traditional powwow songs,  traditional Otoe songs, even some peyote. I   m even starting to learn  some of the northern tribes. As far as hand drum songs, I know Otoes  have more of what we call War Mother songs that talk about the  mothers and what they went through during when their sons were away.  Also with Round Dance songs. I   ve always felt that with some of the  newer and contemporary music I listened to growing up, it was a lot of  Motown, a lot of funk. I knew the Temptations, O   Jays, Marvin Gaye,  Stevie Wonder. Then at the same time, I listened to Prince, George  Clinton, Parliament-Funkadelics, some of those, even Earth, Wind, and  Fire, some of that funk, and then some of the   90s hip hop, Kris Kross,  Kid    n    Play, Naughty by Nature, Salt-N-Pepa.  Some of those groups that made strides for their particular genre of  music, or even starting new music. Even what we call dance music  today, people call it techno. People call it electronica. It has that 4/4  beat, which started from disco but then went underground as the hip hop  movement started right around then but went mainstream. You have  two different genres of music that started one way and ended up  another. Hip hop was very underground music, then in the mid-  80s and    90s, people started listening, able to put a beat on a tape and play it,  and some guy rap to it, not needing records or a DJ. That whole  9  movement went underground. Some of that went underground, but a lot  of it went mainstream with the artists whereas dance music went  underground.  Then into the   90s and early 2000s, you see a lot of the raves and saw a  lot of the big European techno, electronica things come up. I   ve always  been fascinated with that 4/4 beat as far as dance music because it  reminds me of the 4/4 beat of our Native American drums, our big drum  at the powwow, that feeling you have when you hear that drum and that  feeling. You can even feel it. It   s a big drum. You could consider it a  bass drum. Just hearing that beat, you kind of feel it. Same thing with  bass, same thing with some of the music nowadays, where previously  you had that 4/4 beat. I   ve always been intrigued and pushed to that  beat as opposed to a lot of Native Americans who I   ve ran into. They  can go dance at the powwows, and they can listen to the music, but  when they go into a nightclub or something, it   s like you did something  very wrong against the taboo of playing dance music.  They want, really, hip hop or rap to hardcore rap, and stuff that, like     none of the music that they listen to talks about what they   ve gone  through. They   re just,    Oh, I like this song.    I   m like,    You   re not even  listening to the words.    Sometimes I can   t see that, as far as yeah, they  dance to the 4/4 beat during powwows, but then when they go to a club,  it   s totally a broken beat and a slower tempo of hip hop or rap,  something like that. Even country has some of that 4/4 beat. That   s  some of the things I like to do as far as I want to bring traditional  singing, some of the songs and some of the melodies into kind of a  mainstream music such as dance music to where it   s easier for me to  sing to it and flow to it. At the same time, I can at least manipulate it or  even change it. Even if I write something that doesn   t have any Native  influence, the melody is a native melody or something.  Anderson So you incorporate a lot of traditional music     Plumley Yes.  Anderson    within more current music. How did the public receive your new form  of art?  Plumley Some liked it. I know there some that just like,    You shouldn   t put that  and that and that together. That   s been for over here. That   s been for  over here.    At the same time, I   m like, not a whole lot of people know  about Native music. Not a whole lot of people understand it. They just  hear it as gibberish. If I can somehow connect it with something that  they know, maybe that can help them out and understand it more. It   s  really difficult when you hear someone, even someone who   s come  10  from hip hop/rap, listening to what they call East Coast or West Coast  music trying to bring them into hearing Native American music. All  they hear is,    Oh, that   s just a lot of people making noise with their  mouth.     You can even bring them into the dance music.    Oh, this is the same  music over and over and over.    No, you have the same beat over and  over, but each song is different, different bass lines, different melodies,  things like that. They   re continuously mixed because a) we want people  to dance. Now, in Native American singing, you don   t have that  continuous beat. You have a song that plays for a little bit until they get  through the song. There   s a stop, and then they start another song. They  can continuously go through that whole routine for thirty minutes to an  hour. Like at the Denver March Powwow, there   s thirty-seven, forty  drum groups that are there that are singing. One starts as soon as  another one gets through, the next drum group starts, sings a song, and  keeps going through in a tribal until the committee or someone says,     Okay, we   re done. Let   s have some contests,    or,    Let   s do something,     We have a special,    or something. You can keep on going like that.  Sometimes people just kind of freak out sometimes. Some really enjoy  and like hearing the difference and seeing Native music being brought  to the forefront, brought to contemporary music. Some have done it  well, and some have crashed and burned. I   ve heard some music where  I   m just like,    Wow.    It sounded   they clashed too much. Either they  put the wrong melodies together or put the wrong songs together. I even  heard some people try to do like a little mashup and not even a whole  lot of manipulating. They   re like,    Oh, this is a great song,    and I   m  like,    No it   s   .     As far as me, I started as a DJ. This is some of the music I wanted to do.  It started because of that. We have a term in DJing. You   re mixing two  songs together, and you want to keep them on the same beat, the same  tempo. If one goes off the other, you start hearing like a horse, or it  doesn   t sound right. The beats are not hitting together. It   s all jumbled  up. We would call that a train wreck. A lot of times, I   ve heard some  people   s music that   s just, is just wrecks. There   s some newer groups, a  newer group that   s coming out, kind of doing something a little bit  different. I appreciate some of the new people trying to push it together.  I guess with me, I   ve had stuff. I just haven   t really published it yet.  I   ve performed it live but haven   t really published it yet. I   m at that  point to where I need to finish the rest of my album and put it out there  and see how people react to it.  Anderson How have your educational experiences impacted your career as an  artist?  11  Plumley Probably out of high school a couple years, I was doing vo tech. Then,  there is a eight-year span there that I started DJing, and that was all I  was doing. I started writing music and composing. Never had any  formal classes. I was just learning on my own. I knew that I wanted to  at least get a degree or something because I wasn   t making enough  money to keep up my musical habit. Being a DJ and also being a  producer, there   s newer stuff you want to get, or there   s certain types of  equipment you want to get. If you don   t have the money for it, then  you   re out. If you don   t have enough money to promote yourself or get  CDs or get cards or get t-shirts or something to promote yourself, then  you   re not really moving forward. It takes money to make money,  unfortunately.  I decided to go into college. I actually got into University of Oklahoma  in the school of music before I was accepted there, before even in the  university, as a composer. I had a different outlook of music. I   ve  always been hip hop, rap, dance music, stuff like that, so doing a whole  180 of learning classical music, writing classical music, to even writing  electro-acoustic music. You take numerous different sounds, or even the  same sound, but manipulating it to where you   re creating like an  orchestra with sound. Now, it   s not going to sound musically. It   s going  to sound totally off the wall, but if you really listen to it, there   s some  musical elements to it, there   s a rise and fall, how music builds up,  breaks away. You would prelude, two verses, a chorus, and stuff like  that, but still you   re listening to sound, as opposed to an actual  orchestra. Kind of broadened my horizons as far as that, thinking of  new ways to incorporate Native voices and drums.  I did a track called (I can   t remember now)    Path of the Moonlight    or  something. I was thinking of it as far as there was drums, there was  singing, there was flutes, there was some deer toes. There was some  wind, some different elements. I didn   t really think of how it would  sound. I know my mom listened to it when I performed it. I played it,  and she was like,    You know, I was thinking of maybe this is what it  sounded like, people who were traveling from the east to the west in  Indian Territory, something similar like that of different aspects and  stuff and walking to unknowns.    I thought that was pretty interesting  that I know my mother had no idea if the music was right or anything.  For her to listen to that and make that assumption in where I kind of  thought that could be it, but I wasn   t for sure. When she said it, I think I  changed the title to something like    Evening in the Woods    or    Evening  of Walking    or something. I can   t remember exactly what it was. It   s  been a while since I even brought it out. I know I have it on my  SoundCloud account. I got some people to at least listen to it. It   s  electroacoustic. It   s a bunch of sounds, but I think it   s artistically done.  12  With the art form and stuff, trying to put it all together, it can be tough.  I was trying to learn it as far as an educational experience, but I kind of  got to a point where I couldn   t really pass the sight singing or ear  training because my ears have been trained differently than  contemporary and the western music or anything like that. Some of the  notes that I sing, or people sing, in different songs fall in between the  keys. It   s another different music. I can   t remember exactly what the  scale would be called for that. That   s probably a master   s student in the  musicology department. (Laughter)  I would hear the C on a piano, and it would give me, like, a little, small  melody to sing. I could sing it fine going up, but then when I come  down, I change keys in minor. I change the minor key, but when I came  back up, I would finish right where I started on C. A couple of the  professors were trying to understand how I did that. I was like,    Well, a  lot of our singing was you would start a song and everyone would  match you.    When I   m singing in the choir, I   m fine as long as I hear  someone, a certain group of people, singing my certain part. I could  match them and then sing with them. If it   s just me, I may or may not  be in key or have the right notes because we   ve always been   you sing  the song. You sing how you sing. You   re not singing to a scale. You   re  singing of how you feel.  A lot of times, the traditional powwow songs, you start lower pitch in  each, we   ll call it push-up, or each start. You have the song as far as the  start, and you have the second, which mimics the start, and then you  have the first verse of the song. If it was southern or northern, you have  three honor beats. Northern has it to a certain point where the song  ends, there   s like a short break, and it comes back on the one. It   s  usually one-two, one-two. Even though it sounds like a 4/4 beat, it   s  one-two, one-two. A little bit easier to understand, but it comes back in  on the one with the second verse. Southern has the three verses. Of the  three, it   s like one, two, three, and then start with the second verse.  When the second verse is over, you start the lead again, so it   s another  cycle.  I was always taught that you would start the first one lower. The second  one you come a little higher. The third and the fourth, some say,    Kick  it up,    but we start hitting the drum harder. We kind of crescendo. You  would sing higher pitch there, and then little bit higher on the fourth.  There   s got to be a level where if you continue on the song for a fourth,  fifth, sixth, seventh time, you   ve got to stay at that same level four.  Maybe you can even drum it down to the third one, but you never want  to drop way back down. Once you kick it up, you   ve got to stay at those  two. Trying to balance that and putting that into music and stuff, I just  13  made a decision,    I probably can   t get through this. I can try really hard,  but I know that my heart is wanting to write music on my own and do  things, not be really classical trained.     Even though I love the music theory, I love doing the musical stuff, I  really wanted to write a   I still, probably to this day, am going to do it  eventually, write a cello and like a clarinet, but have them talking like  two women. The older woman is the cello, and the younger woman is  the clarinet. Yet at the same time, I want them talking seriously, in the  same time, joking around like a grandmother and granddaughter. She   s  getting on to her, but at the same time they   re both joking and laughing  about certain things, like they are talking about men, or they   re talking  about boyfriends, or they   re talking about certain relations. At the same  time, there are certain points of seriousness involved. I even thought  about doing like a little group of flutes, or group of clarinets, or group  of trombones. They   re guys, but they   re all talking like   it   s kind of  how Native men talk about women or something like that. They   re all  laughing and joking, things like that.  I did write a four-piece flute that each piece was a different Western  flute. It was alto, piccolo, soprano, and   no, bass, piccolo, soprano, and  alto. In it, I talked about where I came from with my dad and learning,  to making the transition to be student to teacher, being someone who  looked up to my dad, to being in his position. Now people are looking  up to me, that whole changing of things.  Anderson What are some of the struggles you   ve had as a Native American artist?  Plumley Publicity, getting my name out there. I have my DJ name as Olywurld.  Not a whole lot of people know it. Some do; some don   t. Just  marketing, getting out there, even to get like a logo to symbolize kind of  Native, but at the same time kind of more of a symbol as well. It can be  a struggle just to be out there because a lot of the artists and a lot of the  companies are looking for, like, American Idol types, the boy band  types, or the girls, or the sexiness, you know. They   re looking for all  that because that   s what sells, but they   re not really looking for artists or  our music and stuff.  I even know some guys that constantly struggle to make it like that.  They may have a few albums out, but they still can   t make that  mainstream. Some are trying for mainstream. Some just want to make  music and let people think and listen. One of my good friends, Quese  IMC, he went to Brooklyn to MC, and he met a lot of the people who  are doing things, a lot of the influential people of the hip hop era that  started in the   80s and   90s, DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa. Who else  did he meet? I think he met Grand Wizard Theodore. Some of these  14  guys were the first DJs, the first musicians to put some of the hip hop  beats together. Afrika Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation was very  influential. For him to meet those people in that circle of him being a  hip hop MC was great. It was just like, man, if I met some people as far  as dance music producers in my travels along with the guy who  produced for Paul Oakenfold, Tiesto, Bad Boy Bill, Benny Benassi.  Trying to think of who else.  Deadmau5. He   s been really big. I met him when he first started out. He  didn   t have the whole head or whole mouse thing. It was before that.  Him and a guy named Chris Lake from London, they were just kind of  like me, just goofy, wanting to play dance music. Meeting them in  different places, going to different places to DJ and to listen to music  and listen to other artists was great, but the same time they   ve got so  many people trying to fight and trying to get noticed. A lot of times you  can step on the wrong people or hurt the wrong people. We forget what  the main thing was that   s just making music, making people dance, and  making people like it, and at the same time trying to promote diversity  and let people hear your culture. It   s been a real struggle as far as that to  at least get your name out there and at least get a fan base.  Anderson Have there been any instances where you feel as though you   ve had to  choose between the traditional way and the Western or American  music?  Plumley It has. There   s been some times where I was like, man, if I just make  that one pop, catching, hook American song, maybe I can have  everyone else listen to my stuff. At the same time, if I make that song,  people are going to want more of that type of song and not what I really  want. It   s a struggle of where do I cross that line. Where do I leave my  traditions and be mainstream? I can   t leave my traditions because that   s  me. That   s how I   ve grown up. I   ve never had an option because that   s  always been me. It   s always how I lived, how I   ve been raised. As far as  those ideas, those thoughts that we call teachings of our ways, it would  be bad to go one way and just totally lose yourself as far as your  upbringing.  One day you   ll look yourself in the mirror and go,    Who am I now? I  knew who I was then, but I took this route, and now who am I?    You  may look at yourself one time, and you   re Native, you   re proud, you  sing, you dance, do all this stuff. Then five years later, you   re just in  your room composing music. You   re not getting out there. You   re not  dancing. You   re not seeing the people. You   re just making things  because people like it. You try to find that line of where do you give in,  or do you stay your course.  15  I can   t think of this composer   s name. He   s done numerous stuff. I think  he was about eighty-six or eighty-seven at the time. It was Struinski or  Starenski or something. I can   t think of his name. My professor, Dr.  Marvin Lamb at OU, he presented this gentleman   s music to us. Really  interesting, really among the bizarre. I   ve never heard anything like it  before. It was a mixture of electronics, of contemporary Western music,  and then things, just something different added to it. He was saying that  there was a time when he did give in and write 1920s and   30s jingles.  He made little commercials, but it got to the point where that   s not the  music he wanted to make. He composed the music that he wanted, and  he said in one of his interviews,    Write the music that you love, that  you feel. Your audience will find you.    I   ve always kind of kept that in  my mind of, yes, I could make that mainstream pop song and sell it to  Justin Timberlake or Bieber or Beyonc   or something. At the same  time, I want to write the stuff that I want to write, and at the same time  use my Native songs, customs, and try to preserve them at the same  time of writing newer music.  Anderson Putting a contemporary spin on traditional music has, I   m sure,  inspired others to follow your footsteps. What advice would you give  young artists that want to venture out and find their identities as Native  artists?  Plumley I would say let other people listen to your stuff. I know that you might  like it, like,    Oh, yeah, it   s great     Then someone might say,    No   .     Just let others use it, but the same time be respectful with the songs.  Don   t really try to chop up the songs. Keep their meaning into it, their  singing, or the parts, even the words and stuff, but don   t try to, as they  say, chopped and screwed, or change it all up. Don   t tear it up too much  because you   ll lose some of the meaning the song originally has  already. You want to bring that into your music and make it better, as  opposed to getting something and chopping it all up and making it  totally different.  I   ve heard a dubstep Native song, and it was just like, why chop it all up  when you could have used that small melody of that singing, that  person   s singing, and made it into something that fit with it? Just be  yourself. Be respectful of the artists and other people and other music.  Don   t downright criticize right then and there. See some of their  mistakes and capitalize it onto yours. At the same time, if you see  someone struggling, and you know that little bit of advice can help  them, help them. There are so few Native artists as far as music,  musicians, and composers in music. You want to help out anyone you  can.  16  In our nature and our customs, we   ve always had that sense of  community and sense of helping people and helping one another. I  know in the past hundred or so years, we   ve always been taught in  school and stuff about you, me, I, fight and fend for yourself, but there   s  not that many of us. The more we can help each other, I think the more  we can grow as an artist, as an artist group, as an artist base that maybe  we can at least get acknowledged.  I know there   s some artists out there that completely write  contemporary music. They   re Natives, but some of it they try to  incorporate traditional stuff. Some of the melodies I hear are not really  traditional. They   re all kind of Western contemporary. They   re just kind  of piggyback on the thing of them being Native. That   s great, you  know, but I really haven   t heard some of their traditional songs in some  of their stuff. I haven   t heard some music from some guys from the  Northeast that are like,    We   re Mohawk,    or,    We   re Iroquois,    or  something like that. I   ve even heard some of their songs and some of  the songs they sing and stuff. Even listened to some of their music, and  am like, okay, where is the influence at?  I was up for an award with a piece of music I wrote. It was the Native-E  Music Awards. There   s some group in Gallup that tried to make a  award show that kind of was supposed to rival the Nammys, the Native  American Music Awards. Never did. I think it lasted a couple years,  two or three years, and that was it. Myself, Terry Tsotigh, and a few  other artists   I never knew them. I never knew who they were. There  was a thing online. You could go listen to their submissions. Terry   s  was blues, blues harmonica, kind of contemporary. I could hear some of  the melodies were Kiowa because he   s a Kiowa Straight Dancer and  I   ve seen him Gourd Dance. Some of the melodies I could hear were  literally the Kiowa Gourd Dance or a little bit of some of their songs,  just a tad. I could hear it. It kind of made everything better.  With some of those other submissions, I was just like,    Where is the  Native influence? Where   s that pentatonic structure of something?     Wasn   t too much into it. Some of it was a little bit new age, and I   m  thinking to myself,    Where were they going with this music?    At the  same time, are they really traditional people, or Natives that just found  out they are Native and want to write some music and submit it because  they just found out they   re Native or something like that, that they  weren   t brought up in those upbringings of songs and that kind of  culture stuff. You can tell from a person   s music how they influence  some of the traditions, some of the culture into it.  I like Terry Tsotigh because he plays a lot of blues and stuff, so I can  relate. He mixes in some of that, some of his flute music and a little bit  17  of Native vocals into it. I did a song called    Bounce    that I made the hip  hop beat similar to mid-  90s hip hop. In the style of hip hop, I made the  beat and then recorded it. I played it, and then I freestyled a Native  American flute on top of it. Didn   t really have any notes or anything  like that or any paper saying,    Okay, this is the type of holes to play.    I  just went with it. I think it took me maybe one, two recordings, and that  was it. I was happy with the recording and just the fact that it got  selected to participate. I think I came a close second to Terry   s. He won  the award, but just to be in the same breadth as him and all that he   s  done in the past twenty, thirty years of playing the blues was something.  I   ve heard of artists and stuff that represent Chickasaw or Choctaw or  something like that, but sometimes some of the music seems too far  Western, and there   s not enough Native influence. Then again, I could  be wrong. Just from what I   ve heard from some of these other artists, I  think they need a little more traditional stuff mixed in with it. You can  blend it very well, very tedious, but I just know that maybe they haven   t  found that way. Maybe they haven   t put it all together quite right. I  haven   t been able to talk with anyone or visit with anyone. Some could  be stink. (Laughter)  I know Carlos Nakai is known to be just very terrible. People put him  on the pedestal,    Oh, he   s a great flutist.    I   m like,    There   s a lot of  great flutists. That   s not the point of playing.    You   re not trying to be  the world baddest flutist. You   re playing the music for people.  Ultimately, that flute was courting. It was a type of courting for a male  to court a Native woman. I see a lot of women playing the flute, and I   ll  say,    Okay, now, is she courting a man?    (Laughter) There   s been a lot  of nice flute music that   s come out that I listen to. There again, what   s  the line of calling it traditional and calling it contemporary? Like what I  played was contemporary, but yet I use a traditional instrument in a  contemporary manner.  Anderson Right.  Plumley I would like to see more artists bridge that gap as far as using traditional  instruments contemporary, but then also same time using contemporary  instruments traditionally. The more we can preserve our songs, the  more we can preserve our culture, at the same time blending it in, I  think that   s going to help us carry us in the years in the future.  Anderson Well, it sounds like you   ve had a wonderful and prosperous year. Is  there anything else you   d like to add?  Plumley Just as far as other artists and as far as people who are listening to  music, just stay open minded with some of the Native music. Listen and  18  always be respectful. A lot of our songs, a lot of our language is kind of  dying, so a lot of our history are in our songs and in our culture. If it is  from the Cherokee Stomp Dance, to a Navajo prayer song, to some of  the powwow songs of the three affiliate tribes of Hidatsa, Mandan,  Arikara, to even in Canada to the Crees, to the east of the Mohawks,  and Iroquois, Pequots, stuff like that, we have all these different songs  and stuff, just preserving them. There   s a lot of our songs talk about  things have happened in life, things like battles and war, things that   s  gone on. Even the Poncas have a song called a children   s song. It talks  about the children that died during the flu epidemics that hit the world, I  think in the late 1800s and early 1910s, 1914, 1920, somewhere through  there. They wrote a song about,    Where are all the children? Where  have they gone to?    Songs like that that have a lot of meaning still need  to be continued on.  At the same time, I know there   s a lot of young singers, a lot of  powwow singers that are making new powwow songs, making a lot of  hand drum songs. Some are very beautiful, and some are very funny.  Even some of the traditional powwow songs have a lot of meaning and  have a thought process behind it. One of my friends, Charles Nikolole,  he was sick in the hospital in Connecticut after the Mashantucket  Pequot, their big powwow called Schemitzun. He got sick. He got in the  way of something that wasn   t meant for him. He was trying to do  something with someone else, using as we call it bad Indian medicine.  He kind of got in the way. He wasn   t expected to live, but one of my  good friends, Sheevers, made him a song. It   s a very, very beautiful  song. New artists like that, singers writing more contemporary music  can perpetuate our singing to the point of combining traditional songs  with newer Native American songs. Then we can also influence that  into other mainstream stuff, just to let people know that we   re still here.  We   ve never gone and will probably never leave.  Anderson All right, well, thank you so much for your time. I really appreciate it.  Plumley No problem.  -------  -------
