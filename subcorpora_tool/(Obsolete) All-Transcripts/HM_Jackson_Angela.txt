Speaker 2: My name is Angela Ruth Jackson.  A-N-G-E-L-A, R-U-T-H, J-A-C-K-S-O-N.  I am known as Angela Jackson.
Speaker 1: And do you have any nicknames or?
Speaker 2: My family name is Dolly.  That is because my mother's name is Angeline and to, my nickname stuck because my mother is sometimes called Angie or Red, so they couldn't, very few, some people call me Angie, but mostly in my family I'm called Dolly.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: My date of birth is July 25th, 1951, around sunrise.  My place of birth is Greenville, Mississippi in the Delta of Mississippi.  It's called the Queen City of the Delta.
Speaker 1: Now when people say the Delta of Mississippi, they're talking about along the river, right?
Speaker 2: Along the river, the fertile area along the Mississippi River.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: November 22nd, 2005.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at HistoryMakers, 1900 South Michigan [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 1: This sounds like an interrogation.  One more question, what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: I am a writer and a teacher.
Story_ID: 111950
Speaker 1: Okay, now before we go into depth, we got five light-weight questions that we ask as sort of a warm-up and they only require a short answer.  The first one is what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I really couldn't say.  One dish?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess.
Speaker 2: I like avocados.  You mean a dish?
Speaker 1: Yeah, a food, you know, so it could be a dish.  It could be--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Let me tell you this story.  When I was in Africa, I could have stayed a little bit longer, but all I could think of was getting some grits and eggs in, back home in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So it could be grits and eggs.
Speaker 2: It could be grits and eggs.  It could be red beans and rice.  It could be eggplant parmesan; it could be (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good enough.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: It could be gumbo.  I forgot seafood gumbo, I love.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is orange.  I also like hot pink or a rose-colored pink.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer or spring or late spring.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: I've been to Africa once, and I'd like to go back to Africa.  I was just thinking recently I'd love to go to Brazil because I studied Brazil in graduate school.  I've been looking at pictures of Salvador da Bahia [Brazil] recently and I'd like to go there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I'd like to go back to Africa.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Usikate Tamaa. It's a Kiswahili saying.  It means--
Speaker 1: You have to spell that, wait a minute--
Speaker 2: U-S-I-K-A-T-E, new word T-A-M-A-A.  It means "do not despair."
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how you learned that, that phrase?
Speaker 2: No, it's just a phrase I learned in Kiswahili class at Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] with Johannes Mlela as my teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay, how do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: J-O-H-A-N-N-E-S M-L-E-L-A.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He helped me to learn that phrase because I had to struggle from being a D student to a B student in Kiswahili.  I had to learn not to despair.
Story_ID: 111951
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with your mother's side of the family.  Can, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Angeline Virginia Robinson-Jackson.
Speaker 1: Okay, and can you spell it for us?
Speaker 2: A-N-G-E-L-I-N-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, Virginia, okay, all right.  Can you give us her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: November 26th, 1921, Indianola, Mississippi, same place that [HM] B.B King was born.
Speaker 1: These Mississippi names always almost sound like they're biblical names--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: My, yeah, my mother was named after her aunt who was named after her mother.  So, it's a family name.  It's a passed down name.
Speaker 1: Even the names of the town 'cause of their relationship to, to the Civil Rights Movement-Indianola [Mississippi], Philadelphia [Mississippi], Greenville [Mississippi]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I mean--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I mean you hear 'em so much and you know that some dramatic incident took place there or a struggle was going on there--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But--what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace the ancestors?
Speaker 2: Do you know I, I started to get this straight with her last night, but I went out, so I didn't get a chance to get this straight with her.  I do know that her grandmother was Queen--I think her grandmother or her great-grandmother was Queen Victoria Street.  That was her name, Queen Victoria.
Speaker 1: Queen Victoria, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. I do know that--
Speaker 1: Last name was Street?
Speaker 2: Street, yes.  I do know that one of her ancestors was East Indian and I asked my mother about this and it was a young, it was man; he was married to a pure African.  I asked her about him, and I said, "You mean he was West Indian."  She said, "No, he was East Indian."  I said, "Well how did he get here?"  She said, "He came here like everybody else (laughter)."  So, there is an East Indian gentleman buried in our ancestry, and he was married to a pure African.  I also--
Speaker 1: Would he, would he be before your, before Queen Victoria Street?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Queen Victoria Street would be your great grand, great grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, great or great, great, great grandmother would be Queen Victoria Street.  I probably will have to get this straight when I can fill out my form.  I'll, I'll get all of these line--lineages straight.
Speaker 1: Now is there a story behind the name Queen Victoria Street?
Speaker 2: No, she was named after Queen Victoria.  You know, I have a cousin named Queen and then this great-grandmother or great-great-grandmother named Queen Victoria I think it's not unusual for black women to be named Queen.  I think it's a way of, of restoring and reclaiming the nobility of our people by naming girls Queen.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, [HM] Val [Gray] Ward's original name was Valeria, Queen Ward--
Speaker 2: Mm-hm. So, it's a form of resistance.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: My mother also had a Creek ancestress, a Native American woman.
Speaker 1: Okay, is there a name for her?
Speaker 2: No, I don't know her name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There are many back in the 19th century when Creeks and blacks were intermingled--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The Creek War was called by Andrew Jackson--a "nigger war," he called it.
Speaker 2: Oh, did he?
Speaker 1: Yeah--
Speaker 2: Oh well (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, Creeks and blacks.  Are there any stories from that side of the family about life in Mississippi in those days or, or the end of slavery or the fight against it or Reconstruction?
Speaker 2: No, there, there are no passed down stories from that side.
Story_ID: 111952
Speaker 1: So, what do they talk about?  Do they talk about life in Mississippi at all?
Speaker 2: There were stories about the flood in 1927 [the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927].  My mother [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson] told us the story about how her father took them to the church and they had to be waited--they had to wait for the boat to come to rescue them, yeah, so I've always heard about that flood in '27 [1927].  That's why I wasn't really surprised when the levy broke in Louisiana and they had the flood there because I was familiar with the flood of '27 [1927].  I had heard about it not only from my mother, but also from my grandmother on my father's [George Jackson, Sr.'s] side, my father's mother.  I'd heard about that devastating flood.
Speaker 1: Public television recently did a piece on it--
Speaker 2: Oh did they?
Speaker 1: --a year and half ago.  I'd never heard about it.  I've been talking to people I know that have roots in Mississippi that talk about it.  [Dr.] Anderson Thompson's mother was in it with his grandmother--(unclear)--rooftop with the cow--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes and they talked about--my father's mother talked about how she saw dead bodies floating in the water and, and all that and how the water was so high for weeks, yeah.
Speaker 1: The whole Delta all the way up to Tennessee I think was flooded.  Okay.
Speaker 2: So, that's been in my memory for many years.
Speaker 1: Did they talk about--one aspect of the TV show was the fact that a lot of black people took it as an opportunity to get out of Mississippi, yeah because of the confusion of the flood.
Speaker 2: No, no they didn't because my family stayed in Mississippi until after War World II.  Yes, my mother's sister went to California after World War II, and my parents [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson and George Jackson, Sr.] came here, my father came to Chicago [Illinois] in around, he came when I was a baby.  He came in about 1951, and he prepared a place for us.  He got a job at the post office, and then he put the down payment on the house, initially put a down payment on a house in Gary [Indiana], but my mother didn't like the house, so he found a house on 55th and Wentworth [in Chicago, Illinois] and he brought that house, and my family has lived there ever since.
Speaker 1: Okay, let me go back to your mother's side of the family for a minute before we get--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --did your--you said your mother was born an Indianola [Mississippi], right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now did she know--
Speaker 2: They were farmers.
Speaker 1: Did she know the family of [HM] B.B. King?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No (laughter).
Speaker 1: I thought I'd ask, you know.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: But, did she talk about--what did she say about growing up in Indianola or did, did she grow up in Greenville?
Speaker 2: I do know that my mother went to a one-room schoolhouse until she was ten years old and I didn't find that out until a couple of weeks ago.  I said, "You never told me that you went to a one-room schoolhouse," and she said, "You never asked."  I always--I had only heard the part of my story, about the story where my mother was valedictorian of her high school class graduating from Sacred Heart [High] School in Greenville [Mississippi].  So, I assumed that she went to Sacred Heart for her whole education, but that wasn't the case.  She did go to a one-room schoolhouse in, in Indianola, I assume, until she was ten and then I think they moved into the city.  They were farmers.  Her father was a farmer.  He was a dapper farmer, but he was a farmer.
Speaker 1: Did he have his own land?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, they weren't sharecroppers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, well that's an important distinction 'cause there were so many people were sharecroppers.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I know both, neither one of my sides were sharecroppers.  Yeah, so they were lucky.  We were lucky, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there a story in the family about how they acquired the land, you know?  In a tough state like Mississippi I know it's not easy to do.
Speaker 2: They never talk about it.  They never talked about it.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your--your mother was valedictorian of her class?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she had a $100 scholarship to go to teacher's college in Alabama, but she didn't go.  She married my father, and they started their family instead.
Speaker 1: Okay now Sacred Heart's a Catholic school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so is--was your mother Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 111953
Speaker 1: Okay, all right now let me go to your father and can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: George Jackson, Sr., G-E-O-R-G-E, Jackson, J-A-C-K-S-O-N, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: April 16th, 1921.
Speaker 1: And where was--
Speaker 2: Winterville, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Now where is Winterville?
Speaker 2: Winterville is around there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is it near Indianola [Mississippi] and Greenville [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: It's all around there.  I don't know the exact location of Winterville.  I just know it's in that, in the vicinity of Greenville.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  What do you know about the ancestors on your father's side?  How far back can you trace that group?
Speaker 2: My--from a conversation with my father's mother I learned that her grandmother--what she said was, "Crossed Atlantic River in 1821."  It took me a while to figure out the Atlantic River was the Atlantic Ocean.  So, she crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1821.
Speaker 1: That's, that's interesting 'cause we, you know a lot of people have no story in the family about that or they don't, they've lost it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She did tell me that.  She told me that--oh I can't remember how old she was when she told me that because she lived to be 100 years old.  So, she was full of information.  She was the one who told me about the, the flood in such detail.  She told me about the day that my grandfather [John Jackson] came to her farm and chose her.  Her name was, my father's mother's name was Mary Mariah Jefferson Jackson.
Speaker 1: Mariah, M-O-R-I-A-H?
Speaker 2: M-A-R-I-A-H, like Mariah Carey.  He came to the house and he saw her and he threw his hat on her lap and she was his pick.  He chose her.  He was older than her--I think they said he was fourteen years her senior.  He selected her, and she told me how she ran across the fields and leaned against fence and just cried and cried because she didn't want to go with him, but she married him.
Speaker 1: That's the way, that's the story about how weddings I guessed were arranged in those areas I guess, in that time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, they just preselected them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He selected her, and they had fourteen children.
Speaker 1: Did he have to pay something, some kind of a dowry or something?
Speaker 2: I never heard about him having to pay any kind of dowry.  He might have, probably more than likely he did.
Speaker 1: If he had a choice, you know, you kind of suspect that maybe (laughter)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he probably did.  But let me tell you about him.  The story goes that he left Texas and came to Mississippi of all places because he had killed a white man, and the story goes that the posse was chasing him out of town and he got tired of running, so he turned around and chased the posse (laughter).
Story_ID: 111954
Speaker 1: That sounds like a bad man.  So, he [Jackson's grandfather, John Jackson] settled in Mississippi of all places, okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What did he do for a living?
Speaker 2: He was a farmer, and he, but he would do was--I got this from my grandmother too, he would oversee other people's farming in the fields.  He would set astride the horse while everybody else would work and he would oversee their working.
Speaker 1: Okay, so presumably then he would be hired to white people and he would sit, he would oversee the--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: No, he didn't hire people.
Speaker 1: No, he was hired by white people to oversee and work on--
Speaker 2: No, this was his own land.
Speaker 1: Okay, you're saying he, he oversaw the work of other people.
Speaker 2: He oversaw the work of his wife and kids, I guess.
Speaker 1: Oh, owned, owned his land.
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Okay that's different.  I thought he was, he, he would hire himself out to--
Speaker 2: No, he wasn't hired by white people.  No, he had, he had his own land as far as I know.  He had his own land.  As a matter of fact, in, in Greenville [Mississippi] proper, in the city, my grandfather had his little house, on the corner was my Aunt Mary's house, next door was my grandmother's house, in between my grandfather's house and aunt Mary's house was my father's house.  On the other side down from my grandfather's house was my Uncle Leon's house.  You know, so, this was all from property that my grandmother had initially, had initially owned.  Now the funny part of that story was that we always used to wonder when we were little why my grandfather lived in one house and my grandmother lived in another house.  They had a very ci--civilized separation.  And my grandfather would have a young woman who would bring him dinner every evening.  This was when he was old and wasn't as mean.
Speaker 1: Okay, was there a name for that part of the, for that settlement of relatives--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: No, you know, that area of town my aunt told me was called Brown's Addition, but my mother [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson] told me it wasn't called Brown's Addition.  She told me it was called something else, so I can't think of what it was, what it was called.  But, my Aunt Tumpey [ph.] was called--said it was called Brown's Addition.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right 'cause sometimes you know all the relatives are in a certain area they have a name for it.
Speaker 2: No, not, there was no specific name for the area that my family lived in other than I knew that it was all initially owned by my grandfather.
Story_ID: 111955
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your father [George Jackson, Sr.] was born in 1921, did he talk about--what did he say about growing up?
Speaker 2: My father told me a mystical story once about being in the wagon and seeing a burst of stars in the Mississippi sky.  My father was a great storyteller, and he was all, always recounting so many stories.  I know that, he never talked about it, but I know that he had two brothers I think it was who had drowned while swimming and from what I understand it wasn't that uncommon to have people drown while swimming in those days.  He called his father [John Jackson] "Papa."  His father was, what was puzzle to me because his father was a little short man about 5'2, 5'4 and my father was six feet, 6'1.  My grandmother [Mariah Jackson], my father's mother, was on the tall side.  She was about 5'7.
Speaker 1: Did he talk about school or anything like that or?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't talk about school.  As I understand it for a time my father went to Sacred Heart, but then he went to Mississippi Trade School for the Colored, from which he graduated.  That is why my father was a carpenter and could, he could do all kind of stuff.  You know he could do carpentry, electrical stuff.  He could even fix the plumbing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's called Mississippi Trade School.
Speaker 2: Trade School for the Colored.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I was reading the other day about something called Mississippi Industrial School, something like that. Trade School for the Colored.  All right, so he learned how, he learned carpentry?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Story_ID: 111956
Speaker 1: Now is there a story that your parents [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson and George Jackson, Sr.] tell about how they met?
Speaker 2: Oh, they met at school.  They, they were--they weren't in the same class, but I know my, my mother talks about how she did go to school with my father's brother, Uncle Baby Do--his name was Charles [Jackson], Charlie--but we called him Uncle Baby Do.  I don't know why he was called Baby Do, but he was.  He's still called Baby Do.  He's got a shop called Baby Do's Towing [sic Baby Do's Tire Shop] way on the far south side.  But, they just grew up together.  They grew up around each other.  So, I think that must have been after she was ten and was no longer going to that one-room school house and was at Sacred Heart [High School], so the connection would have had to have been going to school with his relatives at Sacred Heart and going around and growing up around there.
Story_ID: 111957
Speaker 1: Okay, we were talking about your parents [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson and George Jackson, Sr.] meeting and--oh anyway they did meet and they got married right?
Speaker 2: Yeah they sneaked and got married.
Speaker 1: They sneaked?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Why did they have to sneak?
Speaker 2: They weren't supposed to be getting married then, but they did.
Speaker 1: Who was opposed to it?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  She was supposed to go on her scholarship remember? But they chose to get married and they did.
Speaker 1: So when were they married?  Where they married--
Speaker 2: They were married May 26, 1940, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, they had been married about eleven years before you were born than right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I was the middle child.  They had, they had a daughter, Emily, who died when she was eleven months old of dehydration.  Oh, that's a sad story.  She took sick.  She, and they didn't take her to the doctor.  They gave her some medicine, and she dehydrated.  Did she go to the doctor?  I don't think--they gave her a home remedy.  I don't think it was--I don't know if I got the story right, but I think my mother had wanted to take her to the doctor.  I can't remember the story, but I know she dehydrated and she died at eleven months, and that is just the saddest story.  And you know how, you know how you know when your parents never get over something, they never got over the loss of my oldest sister, Emily, and my parents had either a lockbox or a little briefcase where they kept important papers and they kept a little red bootie and it belonged to Emily.  They kept that little red bootie and I remember seeing that up until I was way into adulthood.  I don't know where it is now, but they kept that souvenir the remembrance on their baby who died.
Speaker 1: So, now you got seven other brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: I have six sisters and two brothers, and--
Speaker 1: So, that's nine of you all together right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm the middle child of nine, so I'm five of nine.  It's four above me and four below me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's--I have two brothers above me and two sisters above me and four sisters below me.
Story_ID: 111958
Speaker 1: Okay, now when did you--how did your parents [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson and George Jackson, Sr.] decide to move to Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: What happened was, this is the story that my mother tells:  My father came home from the Occupation Forces [American military troops of World War II].  He was in the Occupation Forces in France and Germany in 1944 through 1946.  He had gone to Paris [France] and all over.  He used to tell stories of being in Germany and how they would call him "schwarze" [German word for black], but you could always tell from those stories that he took great pride and a sense of honor in serving in the Occupation Forces, which liberated Europe, you know, at that time and he came home from having served in those liberating forces.  He came home to a segregated South, and, excuse me, and my mother says that he found the segregated South intolerable, having experienced the freedom and the dignity of having served in the Armed Forces, you know, and being outside that segregated sphere.  So, he did not want to live in the South anymore, so that's why not too many yea--oh the family had a store, they had a store on the corner, but he still wasn't satisfied with living and working in the South, that's why the family embarked upon the move to Chicago and he went ahead of us to make the nest, which he did do by finding a job at the post office.  He had another job before he worked at the post office, but I can't remember what it was, but I think being a veteran probably helped him get that job at the post office.  And he got the job at the post office, then put a down payment on the house at, in Gary [Indiana], but my mother didn't like the house, so he got the house on 55th and Wentworth [in Chicago, Illinois].  So, that's how the family moved to Chicago [Illinois].  I was one year old at the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was 1952, summer.
Story_ID: 111959
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: The first one that I can think of is--I think there are some that are earlier, but they're like fragments and I can't really get a hold to them, but the most cohesive one that I can think of is when my mother [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson] went to register me at St. Anne's School, which later became St. Charles Lwanga School on 55th and Wentworth [in Chicago, Illinois] around the corner from where we lived, corner from where our house was and is and the nuns said what's her name, and my mother said, "Her name is Angela," and I said, "Uh-uh mama, my name is Dolly (laughter)."
Speaker 1: So, you knew yourself by your nickname?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm (laughter).  So, that was a jolt and that is a significant memory because it also marked my entrance, entrance into a world outside of my home, you know what I mean? So I was entering the world as Angela then when I started school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is the same school that was St. Charles Lwanga, that is St. Charles Lwanga now, but St. Anne's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  St. Charles Lwanga was torn down.
Speaker 1: That's right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's true (unclear).
Speaker 2: It was torn down in 1990.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's a while ago, but it was St. Anne's then.
Speaker 2: Yes, it was St. Anne, yeah.
Story_ID: 111960
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and the smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Oh I was thinking about this the day before yesterday.  Our neighborhood was unique because we had so many bakeries situated in the neighborhood.  There was, there was Tip Top, Silvercup, Wonder Bread.  I thought it was four.
Speaker 1: There's one there now that has, that still has an operation, Schulze.
Speaker 2: No, they closed.
Speaker 1: Schulze is clo--Schulze--Wasn't it Schulze Bakery?
Speaker 2: Uhn-uh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tip Top, Silver Cup, Wonder Bread and Wanzer's Milk was there on 55th Boulevard [sic Garfield Boulevard], and Wanzer Milk I guess fed into the different bakeries that used Wanzer's Milk.  The model for Wanzer Milk was "Wanzer's on milk is like sterling on silver," and my two brothers--Prentiss worked at Wanzer Milk loading up the milk to the--that was one of his early, early jobs.  But the smell of the neighborhood was the most wonderful smell of bread baking.  It permeated the space.  It was a delicious smell.  I put that into one of the characters in my novel "Treemont Stone."  One of the characters comes from around that neighborhood, so she enters into that world of that, the smell of bread baking.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other signs and sounds or smells or?
Speaker 2: Across the street from our house was a grocery store, and there was a huge mansion with a huge yard where the last white people lived.  I call them the last white people on the block lived.  On the corner was Jackson's Drugstore and they had a soda fountain in there, an ice cream fountain in there, and my brother worked behind that fountain and he served up ice cream and made--my brother George worked there--and he made--I remember an early memory was my brother Prentiss and I went to the mailbox on the corner to mail a letter that my mother wrote to her mother and sister in California.  She went a letter to them weekly on pastel stationery, and we went to the mailbox on the corner to mail the letter and my brother George tapped on the window and he told us to come inside and he gave us each huge scoops of strawberry ice cream (laughter), and I remember that.  At that time that drugstore was owned by a pharmacist named Mr. Jackson.  Later on that drugstore moved right across the street from St. Anne's Sounds when the Dan Ryan [expressway] ripped through our neighborhood and destroyed that half of the neighborhood and destroyed also a way of life.
Story_ID: 111961
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you were small when the Dan Ryan [expressway] was built and came through?
Speaker 2: Yes, early '60s [1960s], yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifty-fifth street from those who are not from Chicago [Illinois] is a boulevard [Garfield Boulevard], grass in the middle--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: It was a very lovely boulevard, and people, people would go and stretch out on that boulevard and even sleep overnight in the boulevard.  I remember us having picnics along the boulevard.  I remember, this is a funny story, I remember and I put this in my novel, this woman in this sassy dress, beautiful suit was walking to cross the street in the boulevard and all of a sudden her panties fell down and the men driving by in the car and she was trying to pull them back up and men driving back in the car said, "Need any help?" (laughter) and she ran across the street and ju--jumped in some bushes and she was coming out stuffing the panties into her purse (laughter).  We laughed.
Speaker 1: Failure of the elastic, I guess.
Speaker 2: I guess so.  It's a terrible--I know she was embarrassed.  I'll never forget that.  I was--that must have been a very early memory.  I know that I was a little girl when it happened, and we just laughed and laughed, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, any other stories from that, that neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'll tell you the story of the power punch.  Next door to us before you go to First Timothy Baptist Church where I used to visit with my friend Bonnie who is still my friend today, next door to us was this big building, a three floor building, a three floor walkup, and there lived this family called the Benfords [ph.], and they had as many kids as us and I would play with Emma, the girl Emma, and Prentiss would play with the boy and we would always get into fights and I would always lose my fights and Prentiss would always win his.  So, one day Prentiss got tired of me losing my fights and he decided to clue me into his scientific invention and this scientific invention was called the power punch, and he said you put all your strength into your hand and you wind it up, you wind it up, you wind it up, then you let it loose and then you put all your power and that power would hit the person and knock 'em out.  Well, I got into another fight with bullying Emma and I decided she was beating me, so I decided to use the power punch on her, and I, I said uh-oh, uh-oh now, uh-oh, so I wound it up and I wound it up, and it wound it up, and I let it loose right at her stomach and she doubled over and she was looking like she was about to crumple, then all of a sudden she rolls up and reared back and looked at me and she beat my butt (laughter), and that's in the novel too (laughter).  So, the power punch worked in a, in a short term way, in the long term it did not work.  The concept was, was, was good, but the results weren't the best of world.
Speaker 1: The anticipation was probably (laughter)--.  If you'd have threatened her with it, it probably would have been better--
Speaker 2: Yeah than if I had actually tried to work it on her.  It worked for a minute, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's quite the story, the power punch.
Story_ID: 111962
Speaker 1: How would you describe yourself as a, as a little girl?  What were you interested in and, and what was your personality like?
Speaker 2: I was interested in books.  I was interested in books.  Every Saturday my sister Rose, my brother Prentiss and I would walk from 55th and Wentworth to the Kelly Branch Library on 60th and Normal [in Chicago, Illinois], that would have been a walk of about a mile and a half.  We walked there and back, three miles in total, every Saturday and get our books.  Also, Saturdays when my mother would come from Mrs. Rupp's [ph.] house, my mother worked for a woman named Mrs. Rupp, who had a daughter named Susan, and my mother would bring me books from, that Susan had finished reading, Nancy Drew, Trixie Belden, Janet Lennon and the Lennon Sisters, Cherry Ames, The Bobbsey Twins, the Hardy Boys, all those books, and she would bribe me to wash dishes.  If I washed dishes, I'd get one of those books.  Well, I'd sneak and try to read the book without washing the dishes, but I loved--she knew that she had me if, if I had, if I could get a book.  I remember when she would take me shopping at Sears to buy a new dress, I would stop in the book section.  I would be more interested in the books than in the new dresses.  So, I have always been in love with books, and I knew when I was eleven that I wanted to be a writer.  I remember writing--when--let me back up, when I was ten I had some kind of glandular disturbance and I wound up in Cook County Hospital for three weeks and oh I missed this around the world celebration that they were having at St. Anne's School that we had been practicing before.  I was hospitalized, so that was a great disappointment of my childhood.  And the following summer when I had turned eleven I went to Mississippi with my cousins, JoJo, Joseph, and Yvonne, my father's brother's children who were being raised by my father's sister, Aunt Tumpey, her name was Jenny B. Wesby [ph.].  She paid for me to go with them, I think probably because I had been sick, and I remember writing a letter home to my best friend, Bonnie, Janice Jefferson, and in the letter I talked about an incident in which I had been run off the road by some white men in a pickup truck and I remember writing to Janice and calling it sarcastically "southern hospitality," that's southern hospitality for you.  And I told her in that letter that I was going to write a novel; I remember this.  And I knew then that I was going to be a writer.  Well, a few years later I forget about being a writer and I wanted to be a doctor.  I think because when I told people I wanted to be a writer I didn't get much feedback, and I had a love for sciences so and I wanted to help people and I had read a book about Tom Dooley, this doctor, a missionary, in Africa and I was influenced by Lorraine Hansberry's Beneatha, who wanted to be a doctor, so I wanted to be a doctor throughout high school into college and then my natural instincts kicked in, in college when I just was not that interested in chemistry and calculus and did not do that well in them.
Speaker 1: How old were you when, when you wrote that letter from Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I was eleven when I wrote the letter, yeah.
Speaker 1: This was like 1962?
Speaker 2: 1962, yes.
Story_ID: 111963
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Was that your first trip to Mississippi?
Speaker 2: I had gone home when I was four with my Aunt Tumpey.  I vaguely remember.  I think I remember riding the train, the City of New Orleans, with her because she took me down on the train and she would, she would pretend that I was her child, you know, she had an affection for me, an infinity.  She was known for being very cruel, even to some people, but she was always nice to me.  I don't know why she took a shine to me, but she did.  So, she took me to Mississippi when I was four.  She helped me go when I was eleven, and she took me with her when I was nineteen.  So, I went to Mississippi three times with her and because of her.
Speaker 1: Did you go to Greenville?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now this is, when you were there in '62 [1962] they were just on the verge of doing the big vote of registration campaign and all that.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: This was about two years away--
Speaker 2: --that's why those white men were driving people off the road because a change was in the air, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have an experiences down there that, I guess, were of a civil rights nature, or did you meet any of the people or, or hear any stories about people--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --like the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] volunteers or any--
Speaker 2: No, the thing that struck me I still remember was changing cars in Memphis, yes.  In Memphis, we had to change cars to the black only cars, you know what I mean?
Speaker 1: So they had certain, certain cars on the trains.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The train, we hear in the song, but I never thought about it 'cause I never went Down South.  The train is called the City of New Orleans right?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, and in Memphis you change cars so that you were only, you were only, you were only on the, in the cars with black people.  I remember when I changed cars.  I remember holding the door for a white woman out of courtesy, and she acted like I was supposed to hold to door for her.  You know how they do? You know how, she thought that her right, and I was being courteous as a child is courteous to an adult?  Yeah, I still remember that.
Speaker 1: You feel a little--(unclear)--you think your being nice and somebody thinks that what you should be doing.
Speaker 2: They, they, yeah, she thought it was her right as a white woman.  Yeah, I still remember changing cars.  No, there, oh another thing I remember about that trip to Mississippi was they had politicians.  I remember seeing on TV the southern politicians and he was saying, I think it was Ross Barnett, and he was saying, "Segregation now, segregation forever" on the TV (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's him--that's, he was famous for saying that--Ross Barnett, the governor [of Mississippi, 1960-1964].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I remember it was startling, 'cause you didn't really see as much of them in, on the TV in Chicago as you did on the TV down there.  You know--
Speaker 1: I think, didn't he say that in response to James Meredith trying to get in a school [the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi] down there?
Speaker 2: I don't what he was talking about.  I felt like he was running for some office at the time, but I could be wrong.  If it was '62 [1962] I could, I could be wrong.  I don't know what he was talking about.
Speaker 1: That was the rhetoric, you know, when you're running for office you, you know.  Ross Barnett.  He never, you know he never--yeah that was his--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I've seen the news reel of him saying segregation now, segregation forever.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  I remember even as a child with being struck with how blatant they were with it by saying stuff like that, how obvious, how overt they were with it.  That, that really was--I was, I was like "Mm, that's amazing" that they would be that, you know, overt with it instead of trying to be subtle that it was all over the, the television screens with that kind of--with that rhetoric, yeah.
Story_ID: 111964
Speaker 1: Now, when you were actually there did you, I mean, in the black community in Greenville [Mississippi], I guess, did you really, did you ever encounter white people, I mean, was it, was there any--I know some people say once you get in the black community you don't even think about it.  It's not until you go downtown.
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember seeing any white, any white people, but I did see--I can't remember if the Chinese people, yeah they did, the Chinese people owned that store on the corner at that, at that point.  There are--this is unusual about Greenville and other places in, in the Delta, that there are Chinese populations and they don't just own the restaurants or laundries as, as we all stereotypically think here in the North.  A lot of Chinese people own corner stores in places like Greenville.  And the other thing that unusual about them is that they talk with a southern accent, and it is hilarious.  When I went down there for my great--my father's mother's funeral, I went to the corner store to shop and I was talking to the woman who was doing our groceries and bagging them and, and I said something about being from up North and being here for my grandmother's funeral, and she said "Who's your grand, and grandmother?"  I said, "Mary Jackson," and, and the man said "Ms. Mary died?" and, and the Chinese woman said [in heavy Southern accent], "I told you Leon mama died (laughter).  I told you Ms. Mary died (laughter)."
Story_ID: 111965
Speaker 1: So, now you were talking about going to Kelly Branch Library [Chicago, Illinois]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --which is the nicest, well it was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It was.  It has hardly anything in it now.  It is really sad to see it in such a shape of, of disrepair with so few books.
Speaker 1: It was the kind of place twenty years ago I was in there it just had a, it's a wonderful feeling, you know, the staff and what they are doing.  It's still a nice library.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but I was in it maybe ten, fifteen years ago.  I just stopped by there because I just wanted to see it, to be inside it, and they just didn't have hardly any books to me.
Speaker 1: So, how did you like school?  I take it you liked school since there were books at school?
Speaker 2: I loved school.  I really loved school.  As a matter of fact, I got a double when I was in fourth grade.  I should have been going into--I think I was in fifth grade for like a month and the teacher, Sister Norma, called my mother [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson] and she said mama the teacher wants you to call her and, and so my mother called her and she said you better not have done anything in school, and I said I didn't do anything.  And the teacher said that I seem like I was bored, and she, she, she didn't want me to be bored and that she thought I could do the work for sixth grade, so I was moved into sixth grade and then I made the terrible mistake of being at the head of the class in sixth grade too, so they hated me (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you were younger than--
Speaker 2: Yes, I was younger than them too.
Speaker 1: Did you have many friends in school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did.  I was friends with Rosa Casselberry.  It's interesting 'cause she's just here, up here from New, New Orleans [Louisiana], and I haven't been in touch with her.  I do want to get in touch with her.  She's a social worker who moved to New Orleans.  And I was friends with Cecelia Tucker who lived on the side street behind Wentworth where we lived.  She became a model, but I haven't seen her in many years.  I saw Rosa at her mother's funeral.  And I was friends all throughout grammar school and high school with Shirley Ella B. Fleming who became the assistant [sic deputy] Commissioner of Public Health.  She's retired now.  She was a nurse.  She went to Saint Xavier where I almost went to college, but didn't go, and now she's working on a Ph.D. in social justice, and she goes to Trinity [United Church of Christ], [HM Reverend] Jeremiah Wright's church.  I just saw her a few months ago, so a lot of my old friends are still my friends.
Story_ID: 111966
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you were a little girl, were you aware of Gwendolyn Brooks in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: I remember seeing a film strip on Gwendolyn Brooks.  I can't remember if it was in grammar school or high school.  I think it was in grammar school.  And in that film strip, I did, I talked about this in an essay that I did for Say the River Turns [Say That the River Turns: the Impact of Gwendolyn Brooks, ed. Haki Madhubuti], and I remember her face, and I remember how pretty she was and I remember her talking about, and I remember her being so dark and pretty and I remember her talking about getting the news about winning the Pulitzer [Prize] when the lights were out at her house and how it was such a blessing, you know, it's such a such a sudden, sudden wondrous godsend.
Speaker 1: So the lights had been turned off at her house? Or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that, that she talked about that on the film strip, and I remember that she was a poet.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned Lo--
Speaker 2: And a Negro woman at that.  We weren't saying black then.
Speaker 1: Okay and, and you mentioned Lorraine Hansberry too, you know about her.
Speaker 2: I knew about, I knew about "A Raisin in the Sun."  Now, I didn't really know or think about the fact that "A Raisin in the Sun" was written by a black woman.  That idea wasn't put out that much then, but just the cast being black was significant and the story being black was significant and the fact that they lived on the South Side was significant, because they used to show "A Raisin in the Sun" on Channel 9 all the time.  And, and the film--
Speaker 1: The film version with Sidney Poitier.
Speaker 2: The film, that's right, and the, and the film they showed the El [the elevated tracks] and the Kit Kat Club and you see where the El is like on 63rd Street and we knew it wasn't that far from our house, so all of that stuck into, stuck in my mind, yeah.  So, even if I weren't aware of the writing, I was aware of the story.
Speaker 1: Did they ever mentioned Richard, Richard Wright or Frank London Brown or any of those kind of writers in school?
Speaker 2: No.  I knew I wanted to be a writer because of the influence of Louisa May Alcott and "Little Women", and the heroine in that story Jo wanted to be a writer too, so it was--and Jo was very independent.  It was more of, what, a pre-feminist, a, a pre-feminist, pre-womanist and early recognition of my own independent-mindedness and also my own love for books that I wanted to be a writer, yeah.  And then later I wanted to be a healer and that combined with it and then that was infused with seeing Gwendolyn Brooks and the awareness of the story of "A Raisin in the Sun," all of those influences, but know I didn't know about Richard Wright.  I didn't know about "Native Son."  I didn't discover Wright until college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 111967
Speaker 1: You know you raise an interesting point when I think about it all the images or most of the images of independent women that, you know, say what they wanted to say were independent women who were writers, even in comic books.  Lois Lane was a reporter--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and she's running around doing whatever she wants to do--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know.  She needs to be saved every now and then, but to make a story, but she's out there doing what--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and on the front page the play became a movie.  The reporter, you know, the writer is a woman that's out, that's out there. Did you, I mean, does that kind of ring true?
Speaker 2: Yes it does and also I have to give credit where credit is due to the nuns who were mostly my teachers.  I was mostly--I went to school with nuns, and no more independent women than nuns, you know (laughter).  They're married only to Christ.  You know, they have a spiritual independence.  They live independent lives.  They're not wives, they're not beholden, they're, they--a friend of mine, Jacqueline [Y.] Collins, she's a state senator here in Illinois, she was talking about recently, she was talking about how the, the church thrived and survived because of women, because of what women did for the church.  Mercy Hospital was founded by the Mercy Order of Nuns that educated me.  Mercy High School did, was founded by Mercy nuns, you know, and I, and I went to grammar school with Mercy nuns.  Saint Xavier University was founded by Mercy nuns.  I went to grammar school with Mercy nuns, and I, I went to high school with the Institute of Blessed Virgin Mary [IBVM] nuns, and the black, the African woman [Wangari Maathai] who recently won the Nobel [Peace] Prize, you know who I'm talking about, I can't think of her name, but she did it, she's from East Africa and she did it for her work in conservation and her work in organizing women.  She was educated with IBVM nuns, the order that I went to school with in high school.  So, I have to say that there is some play in there, and interplay in my consciousness with the, with those independent nuns.
Story_ID: 111968
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you were in high school did you, now you where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Loretto Academy [High School] on 65th and Blackstone right in the heart of Blackstone Ranger territory, 1447 East 65th Street.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard in Chicago [Illinois] many times that the real dense gang territory is not bad for girls.  It's murder for boys, but was that, what was your experience?
Speaker 2: The threat to us was the Rangerettes (laughter).
Speaker 1: That's new wrinkle (laughter).
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Who didn't like women infringing upon their, their guys, I guess.
Speaker 1: So, the Rangerettes were, were they violent?
Speaker 2: Yeah they would start fights.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have to do anything special to--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No I didn't, I never had any problems with them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I never had any problems going to school in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, that was in the heyday of the Blackstone Rangers though.
Speaker 2: Yes it was.
Speaker 1: When a lot of the notoriety was being garnered.
Speaker 2: You know what before the Blackstone Rangers, there were the Disciples, and when I was in gram--grammar school I remember one day the whole school, St. Anne's School got let out early because the nuns had heard that the Disciples were going to take the school.  They were gonna come up there to fight.  They were gonna turn out the school, so they sent us home unless we be stormed by the D's (laughter).  That's how crazy guy, gangs were, even in those days, so we can't just assume that, but at least they weren't shooting like they are now.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you were in high school did you, were you still thinking you were going to become a doctor or had you--?
Speaker 2: When I was in high school I went to something called Biomedical Careers sponsored at the University of Chicago on Saturdays, so yeah I was still interested in becoming a doctor and I scored really, really high on natural science readings.  I still scored in like the 98th percentile in natural science readings.  I didn't score that high in math.  I only scored in like the 54th percentile, but natural science readings I scored very high.
Speaker 1: Okay, it seemed like things have changed because in those days you could, you could be, you could really do well in biology or something without knowing much math, but you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I did do very well in, in biology except for--now this is a terrible story.  I got a D in biology, and it's funny because the biology teacher years later thought that I had won the award for biology, but I didn't, and it was her fault; I will tell you why.  I had, I was being creative and doing a report and I wanted to be like a scientist.  This was the writer in me coming out, and I wanted to be like a scientist and I wrote my observation notes on an experience in fragments, you know, like in sentence fragments.  I jotted, I, I did it in notes and she wanted it in complete sentences and she gave me a D.  So, I wound up with a D and then she wanted to know--she, she did a mental block on what she had done to me and thought that I had gotten the award for biology because I should have because I was the best student in biology, but I didn't get it, but I still remember that.  That's okay I got the award in English, but I still--
Story_ID: 111969
Speaker 1: Okay, so were you writing in high school?  Were you writing creative?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, I was.  In, in, in--when I was twelve, this wasn't creative writing this was, I kept a diary and they were letters to Jesus and they were very personal letters, intense letters to Jesus that I kept a little note book, but they weren't poems and they weren't meant to be published, but my sister found my diary and they laughed at it, my younger sisters, Betty and Sharon.  And my sister Rose salvaged it from them and hid it.  But--
Speaker 1: Do you have still have it?
Speaker 2: No I don't.  I wish I knew where it was.  I wish I knew what had happened to it.  I wish I still had it, but I do remember one thing about it.  I do remember one thing about it that I know about myself based upon it is that I am intensely competitive, but I learn over the course of time and experience to try to compete with myself, you know, not to worry about what anybody else has or does, but just compete with my own work, you know, with what I have done in the past to try to make it better to do, to create something different and better with each turn, with each, embrace of a work as a writer.  So, that's what I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because if you compete with other people, it will just make you, make you nuts.  I was talking to Sterling [D.] Plumpp last night, and he was upset that [HM] Haki [Madhubuti] and I are not included in the Oxford, in the Oxford collection of African American poetry edited by Arnold Rampersad, and I wasn't that upset about, and he said but that's like writing you out of history and I know it is, but I'm in other anthologies.  I'm in the, I'm lucky and glad to be in the Penguin anthology edited by Keith Gilyard and you can't, you can't make people put you in them, you can't--they have all kinds of reasons why they don't include you and some of them is, is, might be as simple as they don't know about your work, which means they haven't done their homework and just you know, just all kinds of peculiar reasons and rationales, so, and, and my other feeling about is who decided that Arnold Rampersad was the authority on African American poetry (laughter).  When did he come along?  I never remembered his name from Black World [magazine].  How long has he been here out here working in the vineyards, so that's why I compete with myself because you can't depend on other people.
Story_ID: 111970
Speaker 1: Okay, when you were in high school now were you, did you do the typical high school stuff, go the prom and?
Speaker 2: Yes I did.  But, I was thinking about that the other day what a nightmare going to the prom was because in those days if you went to an all girls' school, which I did, you had a hell of a time getting a date if you didn't have a boyfriend.  My best friend Shirley had a boyfriend who was in the Navy, and I'm trying to remember what she did at prom time, who she went with, but I couldn't think of it.  But, I went with--my Aunt Nellie got this guy named Robert Lawrence who lived on Wabash to take me to the prom, and we have a nice picture.  He was a very nice guy, and the same for my cotillion.  I had a fix-up with a guy named James Allen that he liked somebody else, but he went, he took me to the prom, to the cotillion as a favor, so I had fix-ups for my cotillion and for my prom.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which, which I was telling a friend recently, Brandy, and she said everybody had fix-ups (laughter).
Speaker 1: It did sound like a common story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you run for class office or anything like that?
Speaker 2: Yeah I did, but I never won.  I was, I was never really--I've been thinking about that too.  I've never really been popular in that sense.  I would sing that little song, Ms. Popularity.  I remember that doll, Ms. Popularity.  I was never Ms. Popularity.  I was always--when I would give my addresses, I would call my fellow students scholars and they didn't want to be called scholars.  I was a little too high-toned for them, a little too--I don't know, just a little too; I just wasn't popular.  I just was a little too, I was--what I was, was one of the co-editors of the high school anthology called "Myself", and I co-edited it with my co-writing partner, Linda Porter, who went to Mundelein College and got a Ph.D. in journalism, now teaches at the University of Miami and her name is Cece.  I can't think of her last name.  I just heard from her recently.  And I also co-authored a play with her, and I acted in it.  I played Mother Mary Pat who was our principal, and I got a big round of applause because I walked like her.  She walked real fast with long strides, and she was short, 5'2 like me, so I walked like her and then the whole school went wild when I walked out walking like her and I was dressed in a nun's habit and everything and we had written a story about the girls and the nuns and it was fun and the whole school liked it.  And I did the class pro--I wrote the class prophecy for the class preceding us and everybody liked that.  So, I was active in school, but I was never one of the girls that people would call popular.  I've always been interested in this whole idea of popularity and how people achieve it.  I think it's just a simple kind of, a certain charisma that certain people have that they don't have to do anything to get it; they're just popular (laughter).
Speaker 1: It seems that way.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 111971
Speaker 1: Now tell me now who were, who were your mentors growing up, I mean, were there te, teachers or people in the community or family members?  Who, who inspired you, you know, to, to write or to do anything else?
Speaker 2: I had a teacher, I can't remember which one this was.  I remember when I was reading something that I had written and I, I remember I was about in third grade and I, I stood up and she was, she was stapling something to the blackboard and she was listening to us read and I stood up and I said that I been a Catholic and I had been sworn in by the, by the sacrament of baptism, and she said read that again.  So, she was struck by my use of language.  I can't remember which nun that was.  Sister Norma in my grammar school years was, was a really good teacher because she brought out the best in her students, and she kind of, she was creative and gave us the chance--oh we had, we were voting on who would crown Mary and Mary was crowned by an eighth grade girl traditionally in the May Crowning every year and usually the girl who was chosen is supposed to be I guess the best character and the most virtuous and all this stuff, you know, good student and all this combination of things and so everybody voted and it was like a three-way tie or something and I remember Sister Norma got a little mad because I was in there with Rosa who was naughty and Cecelia who was naughty and not, well anyway, who was naughty and Sister Norma broke the tie.  She cast the vote for me, and it was like they didn't want--oh I have to tell this story.  I have to tell the story of the spelling bee.  I told you I wasn't popular because I came into that class and I was at the head of the class.  I remember during the spelling bee at the beginning, at the, at the, I was like the last person standing against Joseph Brown, who was one of the bad boys, and he was a real good speller.  I can't remember what word it was, but I could feel them willing me to fail and I messed up, and they were so happy that Joseph Brown won; so, I was not popular (laughter).
Speaker 1: You could feel them.
Speaker 2: I could feel them willing me not to spell that word right.  I think it was because I was proba, my persona, I probably was proud.  I would walk with my head in the air and, and I knew I was smart, though I didn't rub it in to anybody and I wouldn't talk in school.  I wouldn't chat and be chummy with them, you know, and I would do my work and so they did not like me.  One time I did do something out of character in about third or fourth grade.  We were sitting in the, in the, in the little chairs, the little baby chairs that they have in the front of the room to do our reading, and this bad boy named Barry Ray stood up to read and I was sitting behind him and Vicky Mays, the other smart girl who had gotten a double was sitting next to me, and I wrapped my leg around the back of his chair and I looked at Vicky and she said, "Yeah, yeah."  So, I pulled his chair back so that when he sat down he sat on the floor (laughter), and Sister Metroma [ph.] said, "Who did that?  Who did that?  Who did that?"  So, I stood up and she said, "You, young lady, you're going to be a murderess."  So, I was just crushed.  It was terrible.  And then later on that year on Valentine's Day Barry Ray gave me a Valentine (laughter).
Speaker 1: Go figure huh.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so it was, it was, yeah go figure.  So, this question of popularity and, and, and, and getting along with others has always intrigued me.  I've never necessarily been a popular person, but I've always been friendly, so.
Speaker 1: Okay, now you graduated in, from Loretto [Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois] in--
Speaker 2: I graduated from Loretto in 1968.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 112043
Speaker 1: You graduated from Loretto Academy [High School] in 1968 and now this is a time of your high school years were the years of the tremendous, you know, polit, political change for black America and cultural change.  People were, had, had, had the nomenclature change from Negro to black by the time you graduated or was it changing?
Speaker 2: It was changing.
Speaker 1: Changing.
Speaker 2: It was in the process of changing, and one thing that's very, was that's that's funny about my, my--there was an exchange that happened while I was in high school and they brought this group of white students in, and the black students who were like the fire eaters in my class were very conciliatory and very, really, really, really, really nice to the, to the white students who came here, and I was a fire eater.  I was the one who was passionate about black people not being, you don't want us to live next door to you.  You don't want us to do this, this.  You know I found myself--
Speaker 1: --You were saying off-camera that you were kind of conservative in retrospect.
Speaker 2: But, but in that, in that, in that environment I was the one who was the most fiery.  Then in another cir--
Speaker 1: How do you suppose, how do you suppose, I mean why do you suppose that holds true?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I don't know why those other girls were so conciliatory to them.
Speaker 1: 'Cause what you're saying is, I don't know if, if I may, the actions of the white students you were conservative or you saw yourself--
Speaker 2: I wasn't always conservative.  I wasn't, I wasn't always conservative.  I was just passionate about whatever I believed.  So, I was conservative about the war in Vietnam, which was, which was just really, really heating up and I was conservative because I had been indoctrinated to it previously.  We had a debate about the war in Vietnam.  But, before we had a debate, my friend Shirley and I had gone downtown to either the Conrad Hilton [now the Hilton Chicago in Chicago, Illinois] or the Sheraton and the State Department had sponsored these information, what consortiums for students from all over the city, all over the county indoctrinating us on the war in Vietnam.  It was a matter of national honor.  The United States had made a commitment to the people in Vietnam in such in such a year and all of that.  We had been indoctrinated into that whole history of what had happened, so I found myself arguing passionately for the war in Vietnam when we had our debate in school about it and then years later I was reflecting that Phyllis Crocker was right about the war in Vietnam and I was wrong.  In another instance, I found myself arguing passionately for people not to riot after the murder of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] because my classmates were saying we should, you know, we, why should we turn the other check any, anymore, why shouldn't we go out in the streets and I was arguing that we would be going against the principles of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., if we did engage in that kind of activity.  So--
Speaker 1: Did you--now Dr. King came to Chicago [Illinois] when you were in high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did go to that.
Speaker 1: 1966, did you go to--?
Speaker 2: It was a huge thing.  It was a huge event at I think Soldier Field.  It was a whole lot of people there and yes--
Speaker 1: Where they marched downtown to Soldier Field--
Speaker 2: --I was there.  Yeah I was there at Soldier Field when they had a huge Civil Rights rally.  I did go.
Speaker 1: Were you parents politically active or did they talk about, you know--
Speaker 2: No, not, not really.  My father [George Jackson, Sr.] used to buy the "Panther" paper, and I remember, I remember he and my mother [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson] engaging in an argument about the Black Panthers and I can't remember what she said, but I remember what he said, and he said, "No, Angeline it's economic.  They're saying it's economic.  They're, they're saying that this country is ruled by economics."  And I remember, I remember that part of their discussion that they had that day.
Story_ID: 112044
Speaker 1: Did you father [George Jackson, Sr.] read a lot?
Speaker 2: My father read the newspaper cover to cover.  The only book that he read that we, it was a family, it was our family joke, he read that book all day and into the evening in his room.  We were peeking around the corner trying to see what book he was reading.  It was "Another County" by James Baldwin.  And when he finished it, he said I got to read that.  I could hear that stuff outside on the corner (laughter).  I think he had heard so much talk about that he, you know he wanted to see what, what all the big talk was about, so he read "Another Country."  But other than that, I don't remember him reading any books, but he did read the newspaper cover to cover every day.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your mother [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson] did she, did she read?
Speaker 2: My mother was voracious reader.  My mother read everything, and she still does.
Story_ID: 112045
Speaker 1: Okay, so tell me where you were when you heard that [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: It happened in the evening didn't it?
Speaker 1: It was in the afternoon.  I know it was in the afternoon.  When we got the news in, in Dayton.  I mean it was--yeah he was killed I think--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --maybe shortly after two, one or two o'clock something like that.
Speaker 2: Then I, then I must have been in school.  I must have been in school and it must have been why we had that argument, why we had that passionate debate.  Then it would have come over the PA, because I'm confusing the murder of Dr. King with the murder of Robert [F.] Kennedy, and I remember sitting on the couch and that happened in the evening, yeah.  Yeah, we had the passionate debate about King at Loretto Academy [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  I remember the classroom and--
Speaker 1: And most of the rioting in Chicago [Illinois] was on the West Side.
Speaker 2: On the West Side, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Not, not on the South Side where you were.
Speaker 2: No, no.  Thank goodness.  I do remember they wouldn't riot on the South Side; they had big old tanks rolling down the streets on the South Side.  I remember the tanks rolling down the boulevard on 55th.  The tanks rolling towards the armory, yes huge tanks and I remember battalions of soldiers driving past.
Speaker 1: So, there wasn't any street violence as such, but they had, they sent, they dispatched battalions and soldiers?
Speaker 2: There were soldiers on our streets.  That's why there wasn't any street violence they, they had the soldiers out.  The Army or the National Guard was out on the South Side.
Speaker 1: What did you think about that and what were people saying about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I was deeply--I remember being deeply offended because I felt as if they were treating us like we weren't citizens, like they were treating us like they were the enemy, so I still feel--I wrote about that in my novel too--I feel as if they treated us as if we weren't Americans, as if we were the dispossessed, which we were.
Speaker 1: That was quite a spring, you know it begins--
Speaker 2: Yeah it was that April [1968].
Speaker 1: --with Dr. King being killed--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and ends in [Robert F.] Bobby Kennedy being killed in June, at graduation--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: He was killed in June and I graduated in May, yeah, yeah it was.
Story_ID: 112046
Speaker 1: When you were on the verge of graduating had, had you just decided where you were gonna go to college?
Speaker 2: I was going to go to Saint Xavier's College, an all-women's college on the far south side [of Chicago, Illinois] on 103rd and Central Park [now Saint Xavier University, co-educational] where my sister Rose went.  She would have been a senior when I was a freshman, but I was offered a scholarship at Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] and a scholarship at Lo, Loyola [University in Chicago, Illinois] and I remember being in the office at Loretto Academy [High School] because I worked there and that, that--I worked all through high school.  During lunch, I cleaned trays so I never got to sit down and, and chat and play during lunch that much.  I had to eat and then get up and clean trays.  I cleaned trays and a Hispanic girl named Adeline Rodriguez, we both clean trays during lunch and then after school I worked in the office to offset part of my tuition.  So, I was working in the office one day and I was talking about going to college with--we called her mother--Mother Mary Pat, and she said, "You should go to Northwestern and compete with the guys."  I remember that, you know, as if to say you gonna have to compete with them.  You're not just not going to have to complete with girls or women in your life, you're gonna have to compete with men.  And she was very right about that and another thing that happened at Loretto that was significant was in my freshman year we had a different principal and we had etiquette classes and we had to learn which fork was which fork and what to do at the table and all this kind of stuff to prepare us she said for our entrance into the world where you'll be going into the world and you'll have to know how to do certain things, you know what I mean.  We weren't just being prepared to be, we weren't being prepared to be maids or domestics, we were being prepared to be executive secretaries (laughter) or professionals, or professional, or professional women.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that's how you chose Northwestern?
Speaker 2: That's how I chose Northwestern.  I had no idea of going to Northwestern or any school like that until they offered me a scholarship I think based upon my test scores and because when I interviewed with the admissions officer, I interviewed with the woman who would become my college roommate and is still one of my best friends today, Roella (ph.) Christine Henderson Davis, Roella Henderson, and he said, "How did you guys get such wonderful test scores?" You know, because we had, we really tested well.  So, Northwestern recruited us to be in their freshmen class and we didn't go immediately into freshmen class.  That summer they had something called New Cap and it was like a preparatory acculturation program where it was half black and half white and it was designed to get us, to groom us for college work and also to groom us to live in an integrated environment and some of the situations were explosive because some of the people were already black and wanted to prove how black they were and I think ultimately what happened was with the whole New Cap experience Northwestern didn't, didn't get what they had anticipated.  What they got instead was Negro students who became black, you know, in that process, yeah.  We took interesting classes.  I remember I took a class on existential philosophy.  I remember I would spend hours in the library again in Willard Hall by myself reading this book on the rise of the Third Reich.  I was fascinated with those Nazis and how corrupt and terrible they were.
Speaker 1: You, you read the "Rise and Fall of the Third Reich" by William [L.] Shirer, that thick--?
Speaker 2: Um-huh, that's, that's what I was reading that summer and when I wasn't with, when I wasn't doing my course work or just hanging out I was reading about that.
Story_ID: 112047
Speaker 1: So that summer you were sort of in this Upward Bound kind of program of this--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a pre, a pre-college--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but it wasn't Upward Bound.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: It was, it was more sophisticated than Upward Bound because we all tested out of, we were all pretty academically prepared, though I made some poor choices when I went to college because they asked me--my advisor tried to get me to take three classes, but I wouldn't, I took four.  I just was determined to take four and did not do well.  I just did not do well in pre-med.  I wasn't destined to do well in pre-med.  At that point, all I wanted to do was write and that is what I did and take black classes (laughter).  And that's what I did.
Speaker 1: So, did you turn blacker over the summer too?
Speaker 2: Un-huh, I got my hair in an afro July 17, 1968, and I remember debating that summer.  My mother [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson] wanted me to get a perm.  To decide whether or not I should get a perm or an afro and I chose to have an afro, and I remember when I came home one weekend my cousin, Willie Mae, shaped my afro for me.  She had gone to cosmetology school and she cut me out an afro, and I've worn my hair natural ever since. July 17, 1968.
Speaker 1: You remember the date?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It has a significance in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's a jumping off point or something, a milestone.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay now what did that mean for you at that point?  'Cause you know for a lot of people it's come and gone, gone right back and now they're saying this was just a hair style and all that sort of thing, but what did that mean for you at that stage?
Speaker 2: It was a reclamation of myself, of my pure self, of my African self, even though some of my ancestors are East Indian and Native American.  My predominant anstressic, an, ancestry is African and I am African American and that includes some other people, but predominantly African and it was a declaration of independence and my own independent, and independent-mindedness, my own self-determination choosing to myself and choosing to choose for myself who I would be and what I would do with my life, so and then all those things and still does.
Story_ID: 112048
Speaker 1: This is just--I'm just curious here did, did you, were you aware of Malcolm X before he was assassinated?  He was assassinated in '65 [1965] when you were like a sophomore in high school.
Speaker 2: I remember one time when I saw Malcolm X when he was talking about the death of Martin Luth--of JFK [John F. Kennedy], and he said, "Chickens come home to roost," and I did not like him because I liked JFK.  As a matter of fact, I really felt a strong affinity for JFK because he was Catholic, and he was the first Catholic president, and our family is Catholic, so I did not like Malcolm X when he said that.  But, I remember, I cannot remember when I read "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" because I fell in love with him then when I read the autobi, "Autobiography of Malcolm X" and I felt as if I was embarking on a search for heroes and my own heroic self, probably 'cause I was seventeen in 1968, in that New Cap experience.  I was embarking--when I read Mal, "The Autobiography of Malcolm X" and was introduced to African American literature and African American history that I was embarking on a search for heroes and my own self as a hero, and I, I don't wanna say heroic self because we use the term hero until it has become a cliche now.  I had a line in one of my plays that hasn't been produced yet when it was a firefighter and he was dying and he said he was a hero, now I had to change that line because everybody is a hero nowadays.  They just, if you do, if you walk across the street and help somebody across the street, oh you're a hero, you know, it's just, it's just worn out now.  But, I was truly embarking upon a search of heroes, and I meant in the grandest sense of Malcolm X, [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr., Medgar Evers, you know, those heroes.
Story_ID: 112049
Speaker 1: Now during this period of time, did you have, were there any teachers at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] that guided you in terms of this kind of cultural awareness? Or in the community?
Speaker 2: Now, [HM] Lerone Bennett was, was there, but I could not take his African American history class at that time.  My sophomore year I had already taken freshman year, introductory studies, African American literature class with a white Southerner named Austin Fitz, and so I was at least, it was there that I realized and recognized that Lorraine Hansberry was a black woman who had written "A Raisin in the Sun," so at least I began to appreciate her based upon that class and I remember reading "A Raisin in the Sun" in that class.  I'm trying to think of what else we read in that class.  I think we read "Invisible Man," [by Ralph Ellison] but that was a weird book to me.  I didn't connect with a teacher until the following year when I visited the African-oh, no, no, no that's not true.  In my freshmen year, Margaret Walker was there and I had her for African American literature and I tried to get into her creative writing class, but I, she wouldn't let me in because it was for upper classman and I remember I just burst into tears.  I cried and cried, and she said, "Is it because of me?"  I said, "I can't, she said well I'll work with you after class." I said, "I can't, I, I'm in pre-med I can't, I can't you know do an extra class with you" so I couldn't wor, work with her, but she did help me as much as she could because, just because of a comment she wrote on one of my papers that I had done about Amiri Baraka--LeRoi Jones, and she said something like, "You cannot just make assertions, you have to prove what you say" and that was, and I got a B on that paper, but that clued me in, into the essence of prose writing, composition writing.  You have to prove it.  So, she had--because I--she was a brilliant teacher she had very precisely and concisely given me the instruction that I needed to have in order to write successful and meaningful prose and proving it, just, you cannot just make asser--you have to prove what you, what you're saying.  You can't just say Amiri Baraka is a great poet.  You have to show us, you have to prove it.  So, even though she was not my poetry teacher, which was really I think, was really in my own best interest that, that I did not learn ballad forms from her and all that other stuff, thank God, she was a very good Afr--she was an excellent African American literature teacher and--
Story_ID: 112050
Speaker 1: Um--
Speaker 2: Were you aware at the time that she has, I think she's from, she's from Louisiana or--
Speaker 1: No, she was born in Alabama, but she taught at Jackson State in Mississippi [Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi]--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --and she was a visiting professor at Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] and she had attended Northwestern in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was a part of that writers group in the '40s [1940s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes she was, yeah.
Speaker 2: --with Richard Wright and all them.
Speaker 1: Yes, and Gwendolyn Brooks, exactly.
Speaker 2: A knew all them. Were you aware at that time that she knew all those people and what that meant?
Speaker 1: No, all I knew was that she had written "For My People" and I loved it, and I wanted to study with her.  So, the following year in my sophomore year came another African American literature class, which I definitely could not take, but wound up auditing.  It was taught by Hoyt [W.] Fuller and my roommate, Roella Christine Henderson, later Davis, kept urging me to go and show him my poems since he was an edi- editor.  She said, "He's an editor, you're a writer, you should take him your work," so I did.  Christine, by the way is a cousin of [HM] Jeff Donaldson and I and Christine worked for Jeff in sophomore year.  I was his slide assistant, and I filed his slides and during his class in those days they didn't have electric slides, so I had to show, change each slide and show the slides in, in his class while class was going on and I had to take notes at the same time because I was taking the class and Jeff, as you know, was one of the founders of OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture].  Hoyt Fuller was a founder of OBAC and when I gave my poems to Hoyt Fuller he kept them for three weeks and I asked him about them, asked him about them, the man was busy, but he was kind enough to read my poems.  When he gave them back to me, he said very kindly, "You have a way with words.  You should come to OBAC where you might be judged by your peers."  Now I knew about, I don't know how I knew about Don L. Lee [HM Haki Madhubuti] and Carolyn Rodgers, but I did know about them because he said your peers and I was thinking, my peers? They're older than me. They're not my peers, but I did go to OBAC on the third Wednesday of October, 1969.  I took the "L" [elevated train] from Evanston to 35th Street, I got off and walked the three blocks over.  And the workshop was at 77 East 35th Street and the door was opened by Walter Bradford, the poet who had done the Blackstone Ranger workshop, organized that workshop with Gwendolyn Brooks and also present was another poet named E. Van Higgs, and they were very warm and kind to me.  Later on the place started to fill up.  It was a lovely fall evening, the place started to fill up, people floated in and sat down in the chairs and on the couches of that storefront and after a while, Don L. Lee came in and he slid through the, through the room.  Ann Smith came in and she walked through the room.  Then Hoyt Fuller came in and he strolled through the room, and he sat at the front, and I was sitting on a couch and he looked up and looked at me and he smiled and that was how my OBAC experience began and I was a member of OBAC for roughly twenty years.
Story_ID: 110303
Speaker 1: Okay, so OBAC wa--OBAC, O-B-A-C stands for?
Speaker 2: Organization of Black American Culture.
Speaker 1: And it was founded by, who, who founded it?
Speaker 2: OBAC was founded by Abdul Alkalimat, a social scientist, Conrad Kent Rivers, a poet, Hoyt Fuller, a writer and editor, E. Duke McNeil, a [civil rights] lawyer.
Speaker 1: Now, he was a Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] too I think wasn't he?
Speaker 2: Unh-uh.
Speaker 1: Oh that's right, I'm getting him mixed up with somebody--
Speaker 2: No--I can't think of another man named Joseph Simpson, or something like that who did like the community affairs workshop or something.  [HM Dr.] Ann Smith was like in charge of a drama workshop that they worked on development, so she helped them do their presentations of their first public appearance as OBAC.  [HM] Jeff Donaldson was one of the other founders of OBAC.
Speaker 1: So, we got visual artists, poets, you know writers--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They didn't have a music component because they felt that the AACM was in existence and they didn't need a music component.
Speaker 1: The AACM--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians.
Speaker 1: Okay and during that, this time in Chicago [Illinois]--now you're out in Northwestern, but in Chicago proper you got the Afro Arts Theater going on, right during this time?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes it was.
Speaker 1: You got Phil Cohran [HM Philip Cohran] and a lot of the AACM musicians--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: You got a, a budding dance community starting up--
Speaker 2: One thing about the Afro Arts Theater was that when the Northwestern students would first come FMO, For Members Only, the black student union at Northwestern would sponsor a tour into the city to engage the freshmen with the black community in Chicago, and we would go to the Afro Arts Theater.  We also went to the [Black Peoples] Topographical [Research] Center, the Brothers at the Top, and they would give a talk on how we had all been herded into concentration camp high rises, and how one day we would break out of those camps and be a burning mass moving toward the South to establish our own nation.  I remember that one of, one of the students, one of the freshmen got so mad at, at the Brothers at the Top he stormed out of there and I went out after him.  I said, "Just listen to what they have to say.  Just listen to what they have to say."  He did not want to hear another word of it (laughter).
Speaker 1: There was quite a presentation.  I remember the Topographical Research Center in the '70s [1970s].  I came to Chicago visiting them--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: The message was--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --power, but the solution seemed to be, you know, they wanted to do things about the solution of everybody moving South and this guerrilla--at the time did you think it was--
Speaker 2: I was just waiting for the revolution.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All I know is I was gonna be a poet in the revolution, that it would be a black--I was thinking about that--all this stuff that you're asking me now is stuff that I was thinking about within the past week or so and I was thinking what was I thinking? And I was thinking that we would have a revolution and this, after this revolution we would have a new world.
Story_ID: 110304
Speaker 1: Now the concept of creating a new world, though that was something that, you know, in those days, correct me if I'm wrong, it seemed like it was, wasn't that far off,  when you look at some of the activities that were going on.
Speaker 2: Well, to a certain extent we did create a new world because to a great extent the South was changed, to an also other great extent a black middle class was created.  There was an article in the [Chicago] "Sun-Times" that talked about how we don't know how long that black middle class will be able to sustain itself.  I didn't read the whole article, so I don't know what else they said about it, but there are fewer black people in poverty.  But, so, and we are more integrated into this society, so it is a very, it's a very different world than the world I first met when I first was a student at Northwestern [University] in Evanston [Illinois] because when I first went to school there they were like little wars between black people and white people on the sidewalk of who would move over, you know.  It was a clash of cultures, and of you know, it, it was a rude awakening.  We, there would be waitresses who would be rude to black students and black students who would be rude to waitresses based on cli, on skin color.  I deal with some of this in my novel.  So, it was--there were like moments in history that we went through in order to get to this place now where there's a, what, what they call a new norm that--I'm not saying that racial tensions don't still exist, but we could not have imagined this world then.  We could not have imagined rappers all over the TV talking about what they talk about, you know, and making huge amounts of money for doing what they do and--it's a new world.  We could not have imagined--I was about to say we could not have imagined computers, but we could have imagined computers if you went to Northwestern and you went down to tech and you saw those giant computers, you could have imagined computers that do what they do.
Story_ID: 110305
Speaker 1: So, when you joined OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture] now you're surrounded by all these black literary and artistic luminaries and did, I mean, what was the, what was the climate like, was it the--you were welcomed but did, I mean, was it fairly warm climate of people?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm. They were very, very kind to me.  Remember I was the prodigy as you said (laughter).  They were very warm and supportive and nurturing, so, and what was wonderful about OBAC was that I was in a safe environment where I could encounter people, African American people, black people, from all walks of life.  We all met there.  It was like a crossroads of, of different people.  There were--George Kent came there from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  He even did a mini course in African American literature that I helped him design based upon the different courses that I had taken in African American literature.  He was there a few times.  Abdul was there a few times, even though he had, had moved, left the city.  Carolyn didn't come as often, but she did come, Carolyn Rodgers.  Johari [Amini] didn't come often, but she did come.  Haki was there when he was not out of town teaching, and of course Mr. [Hoyt] Fuller was there all the time.  There was one man who was a bus driver who was a frequent visitor.  There were college students.  There were unemployed people.  There were, you know, just all kinds of people who came to OBAC.
Speaker 1: How many people would typically be down there?
Speaker 2: I was trying to think of how many people who would be there who could fit into that room, and I'm thinking about twenty-five; between twenty and thirty people would be there.
Speaker 1: And what would be, what, what would a typical meeting be like, you know?
Speaker 2: First I have to tell you the funny story of the woman who wanted in one time and she thought OBAC was Alcoholics Anonymous (laughter).  We had to let her know gently that this wasn't Alcoholic Anonymous.  The meetings would be--well there would be a chair and the person who was the chair was the OBAC member who was assigned to be the host that month.  They would also, they would chair the meeting and they would be the host.  They would have the business meeting, which would be the fourth Wednesday of the month at their house.  So, the chair would oversee the reading order and he or she would have all guests or visitors read first and then OBAC members would read last as a courtes, courtes, courteous [sic courtesy].
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--bring in a poem or an essay or--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: A poem or essay, a short story, a portion of a novel, whatever you were working on, a play or whatever you were working on or read up to a certain, a certain amount of time, a certain number of pages.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you had so many minutes to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well we wouldn't number the minutes.  It wasn't strict, but you knew not to take up too much time.  People just knew it in a kind of unconscious gracious kind of way that you couldn't read a thirty page story, you know, and plus that wouldn't hold people's attention span because we didn't make copies. You had to be able to hold people's attention based upon what they could hear.  So, people would read two or three poems and people would read a short story or a piece of a short story or a whole short story depending upon how long it was and then people would give feedback.  First they'd ask questions, then they'd make positive comments, then critical comments, and then say more positive comments in a kind of informal order of how you did it, questions, criticisms, comments, you know.
Story_ID: 110306
Speaker 1: Okay, and how often did OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture] meet?
Speaker 2: OBAC met, depending upon how many Wednesdays there were in a month, three or four times a month, and there was a business meeting on the fourth Wednesday of the month.  Yes, fourth Wednesday of the month was the business meeting.  There would be, yeah, yeah, and then there was a rent party on often the fourth Sunday of the month.
Speaker 1: To actually pay the rent for the space?
Speaker 2: Yes, and at the rent party we would engage in a Chinese auction [also known as a penny social] and you would have to pay whatever you bid.  You--Mr. [Hoyt] Fuller would bring back sculptures from Africa and people would bid on them and every time you opened your mouth--Mr. Fuller would bring back statues and different artifacts from Africa and he would auction those and every time you opened your mouth you had to pay.  So, if you bid a dollar and fifty cent, you paid a dollar and fifty cent, then if you bid a dollar and fifty-one cent you paid a dollar fifty-one cent and you would just keep paying until whoever won.
Speaker 1: But, everybody had to pay?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: If they said something, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, that's an interesting concept.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a lot of fun and, and different members would walk around carrying the cans to collect the money.
Speaker 1: Okay, so OBAC--now I've heard [HM] Val [Gray] Ward said that Kuumba Theater came out of OBAC some sort of way, is that you know--
Speaker 2: If that's true, I didn't, I don't know about that.  That may have happened with the committee for the arts, which evolved into OBAC in 1966 was the committee for the arts, and OBAC was officially founded in 1967, so it's quite possible that out of that committee for the arts came OBAC and Kuumba Theater.
Speaker 1: Now was Gwendolyn Brooks involved with OBAC?
Speaker 2: Gwendolyn Brooks was informally involve with OBAC because she ran the Gwendolyn Brooks writers workshop and it ran concurrently, and many other OBAC founding members were also members of the Gwendolyn Brooks workshop, which met on Sunday, once a month Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: [HM] Haki [Madhubuti], Carolyn [Rogers], Sharon Scott, Rancin Boykin, Walter Bradford were all members of the Gwendolyn Workshop, and they were also founding members of OBAC.
Speaker 1: Okay, now were you there when the or had they already written--I know there was an official statement written by OBAC about what is a black aesthetic or what is the black aesthetic.
Speaker 2: That was already written by the time I got there.  That was written in 1967 by the founding members.  I didn't get there again until October of '69 [1969].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Haki said I got there in the middle of OBAC, but actually I got there at the beginning of OBAC, just not the very beginning.  So, I was an early member, but not a founding member.
Story_ID: 110307
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I was still active also at that time in my campus.  That's why it took me so long to graduate.  I was a member of FMO [For Members Only] and on the central committee for a short time, and we were working to institutionalize black studies on Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois]'s campus.  We were doing a lot of protesting and you know organizing to make sure that black studies, we got the education we wanted out of Northwestern to make sure that Northwestern hired black faculty and had African American history and African American literature institutionalized there, which it did become and they have a solid African American studies program at Northwestern now because of the efforts of black students like me in those early days.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, oh one person we haven't mentioned is Sandra Jackson [-Opoku].  I always used to, you know-cause you both were Jacksons (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a lot of confusion about that.
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous)--put you, you know--(simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a lot of confusion about that.  Sandra came to OBAC in about 1971, but she didn't stay long because she went away.  First she went to school at the U of C [University of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois], then she went to school at Columbia [University in New York, New York].  Then she went away to school at the University of Massachusetts and, she sent to school in Africa, so she was away for several years and she came back in around '75 [1975].  She came back from Africa in around '75 [1975].  She came back not too long, I think, before OBAC burned down and Hoyt Fuller left town in that bad year I think it was '76 [1976].  So--
Speaker 1: You said OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture] burned down.  What happened?
Speaker 2: Yeah, OBAC, the storefront burned.  I don't know how it caught fire.  I think it was a heater that caught, that caught fire and it burned, the storefront burned.
Speaker 1: I hadn't heard that story.  I know in '77 [1977] there was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and everything was--it was--the water that the firemen used to stop fire, to stop the fire caused more damage than the fire itself.  So, some of the stuff from OBAC was retrieved and taken to--(unclear)-Northeastern [University] or--I think Northeastern.
Speaker 1: The Center for (unclear) studies.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so.
Speaker 1: Now did you, did you ever attend the Communiversity--(simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: No, I never attended.  I went to a conference at the Communiversity which was a black student conference. I went as a member of FMO [For Members Only], but I never attended the Communiversity.  I did enough to endanger my education at Northwestern (laughter).
Speaker 1: There's so much going on. Chicago--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --was so active, I guess--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes it was very active.  I took some flak from somebody at--the Communiversity had something to say about me never going over there, but I had enough to do.  I didn't, I didn't need to be everywhere.  You know you can't be all things to all people.  You can't do everything and, and do it well.
Speaker 1: Okay, so now how, back at school how were your, you said it took you a while you said to get out of there, but--
Speaker 2: I didn't graduate until '77 [1977].  I took--I called them vacations (laughter).  What they call a mental health, mental health days, I took.  So, finally I had only a few classes to take and I finally finished them in '77 [1977] and I was glad.  One of my only regrets is that I did not march and I did not let my father [George Jackson, Sr.] and mother [Angeline Virginia Robinson Jackson] see me march, yeah.  I, I didn't even think about that until very recently that my father didn't never--my father never got the chance to see me march.  My mother went to my graduation from the University of Chicago, but my father never, my father was dead by then, so he never got the chance to see me march, and that would have meant a lot to him.  I know when I was reading at the Library of Congress in '85 [1985] when Gwendolyn Brooks was the poetry consultant, that was before they called them poet laureates, when I was reading there I know how excited and happy he was that I was reading there and I wish he could have heard me read there, but we couldn't afford it.
Story_ID: 110308
Speaker 1: You, now what was your, I guess, your first poem that you published?
Speaker 2: I had a poem published in "Myself," that anthology we did in high school at Loretto [Loretto Academy High School in Chicago, Illinois] and it was about gang violence, about a boy lying in the alley bleeding and I was really surprised about it, you know, that I chose that topic, that that had struck me--that I had that social consciousness then.  But, my first poem published in a national magazine was published in "Black World" magazine and it was "Black World" then in February I think '71 [1971], I think and it was called "Life is too New."  "Do you ask too much of me black is this the same old buck passing from one generation to another when life is too new," and I can't remember that poem has not been published anyplace else.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1971.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Black World. Now, when I came to Chicago you had, it was a little book of poems out called "Voodoo Love Magic."
Speaker 2: "Voodoo Love Magic" was published in 1974 by Third World Press.
Speaker 1: Was that your first--
Speaker 2: That was my first?
Speaker 1: --book?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And why the name and what was it about?
Speaker 2: It was, it was taken from the title of a poem Voodoo Love Magic-"I'm gonna put a hex on you with some voodoo magic.  I'm gonna-"(laughter) "work some voodoo magic on your mind, I'm gonna mess with you.  I'm gonna make a love tune in your heart have you singing me from me from morning to noon to midnight, you can't help yourself, baby I'm gonna own your soul, make you do to, make you do to me what you done for me--" something like that.  I can't think of the rest of it.
Speaker 1: It's, it's interesting--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah I was just having some fun with I think a record that Nina Simone did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so when you weren't going to school in the early '70s [1970s], what were you doing?
Speaker 2: I had different jobs--I'm trying to think of where I worked.  I know that I was an au pair for an African woman teacher, Omarlar [ph.] Leslie and her husband Joshua Leslie in 1970 and I was going to OBAC and from '71 [1971] to '74 [1974] I worked weekends at Rush Presbyterian St. Luke Hospital.  I, I drew blood and I did CBCs and differentials.  I worked in the hematology lab and I did urines and spinal fluids.  I had to read them for cells, different kind of cells.  I got that because my major had been pre-med.  My cousin had worked in the lab and so she got me that job, my cousin Jerry, Jerry Miles.  And in the summers I did all kinds of things.  I just did all kinds of jobs.  At school I also--for, for non-pay I helped organize FMO's library.  I didn't get paid for that.  That was part of being on the central committee at FMO.  I helped organize the library.  I worked cleaning glassware in one of the biology labs for a short time.  I worked for [HM] Jeff [Donaldson] as his slide assistant for one semester.  So, I just had different jobs.
Story_ID: 110309
Speaker 1: Well the period leading up to '77 [1977] that, just trying to assemble I don't, I can't think of everything.  The little stuff I can think of is OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture] burns up.  In '76 [1976] "Black World" shuts down and ceases publication; '77 [1977] you graduate from school, also the tenth anniversary of OBAC--
Speaker 2: And one of my best friends died in '77 [1977].  He was a student at Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois], Merrill Duane Douglas.  He died in November of '77 [1977] and that was, that was like the, he was like the first person close to me who died, so that was momentous.  Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: Also, did you go to Festac [Lagos, Nigeria] in '77 [1977]?
Speaker 2: I went to Festac in '77 [1977], so--
Speaker 1: That was your first and only trip to Africa right?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was very significant and it marked, I think it marked a turning point in my art.  I entered into a level of maturity in my art as a result of my trip to Festac [Nigeria] as a result of experiencing Africa and so it, it, and I started working on the poems called "The God of Fire," which later became the play "Shango Diaspora: an African American Myth of Womanhood and Love."
Story_ID: 110310
Speaker 1: All right let me ask you about a couple of things and if you don't really have a lot to say about them then that's fine, but I thought I'd ask you anyway for the sake of history.  What is your take on the demise of Black World?  Do you have any sense of why this great magazine collapsed?
Speaker 2: First I wanna say something very personal that happened to me with the demise of Black World.  My first published fiction was scheduled to appear in Black World and it was called "The Role of the Black Woman in the Revolution," and it was like a montage of different settings of a character Maggie, which--who would be the heroine of my novel "Treemont Stone" and it was like a pre-feminist reflections, meditations on being an African American woman, so that was never published and then I subsequently tore it up and used it in different forms and different versions of the novel.  So, it was a personal loss to me in that sense, though I did publish my first fiction in "First World" which was like the brain child of Hoyt Fuller and Carol Parks published out of Atlanta [Georgia].  So, that was a personal loss to me, and it was a personal loss because I had no central organ to publish in that was as widely distributed as, as was Black World and as a young writer that was very important.  In that sense, I was like a thousand other young black writers who didn't have a central organ to publish in that was widely distributed and respected like Black World was.  So, it was a crucial loss to a generation of writers and scholars.  Now why it was discontinued so abruptly I heard from two different people the same story and I don't think they got together to tell this story; I think it's the genuine truth of what happened when they went into a meeting with [HM] John H. Johnson who told them--and Hoyt Fuller in his way verified their story--who told them that he discontinued Black World because that he had received pressure from advertisers who did not like Black World publishing the Palestinian side of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, so I, I got that version of the story from [HM] Haki [Madhubuti] and from [HM] Abena Joan Brown and Hoyt Fuller kind of ver--verified it because he said something like he appreciated the years that he had spent with Black World and he understood that Mr. [John H.] Johnson was a business man and he had to make business decisions.  So, Mr. [Hoyt] Fuller never had anything negative to say about Mr. Johnson in that regard, you know, because it was like he was in effect forced to shut his, his baby down and Black World was John H. Johnson's first magazine.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So it was very--
Speaker 1: --As "Negro Digest."
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah, so it was very important to him too.  So, he either had a choice either to shut it down or to exert a kind of editorial control over Hoyt Fuller, and Carol Parks that he knew he couldn't exert.  So, that's just one of the sad notes of African American history and I think it's an ugly chapter in African American and Jewish relationships to be quite frank.
Speaker 1: Well put. I've heard those stories too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 110311
Speaker 1: Now, Festac 1977 how did you, when did you first find out about this?  Tell me about the process of being able to go.
Speaker 2: Oh God, it's, it's like we always knew about Festac [77, the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture in Lagos, Nigeria] being about to happen.  I, I knew about Festac from Hoyt Fuller and OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture], and I knew it was going to happen and I knew that there was a process.  That process was made very known inside the black arts community.  So, we went through that process and a peer evaluation.  We knew that we would be judged by our peers and we did do that.  I was close to Festac because in 1976 in the fall I went to work in the office, oh no, I went before fall in 1976.  It must have been in early '76 [1976].  I went to work for [HM] Abena Joan Brown at her office at the YWCA of Metropolitan Chicago and out of that office as human relations consultant she did a lot of work with black organizations and black events and one of them was "First World", which was, which was the brain child of Hoyt Fuller and Carol Parks and a group of black intellectuals and activists and another of the things that she worked on was Festac [77].  So, I was intimately involved with Festac, with Festac preparations and information because of my job as her secretary at the Y.  And I was on, I was for a time had like the literature panel and then I was--we--because of peer evaluations I was voted to go, to be able to go to Festac.
Speaker 1: Okay, so basically a delegation, I mean a small delegation from OBAC attended right?
Speaker 2: It wasn't just OBAC who attended, no it was just people--
Speaker 1: --(Unclear)--from OBAC itself 'cause not, not everybody from OBAC went right?
Speaker 2: No it wasn't OBAC delegation who attended.  It was a group of different people who attended, different writers who attended.  And I can't think of the other writers from Chicago who attended.  I've met one of my, who would be one of my best friends at Festac and that was Joyce Carol Thomas, a writer from California.  I saw this little brown woman walking in some boots and I said, "Are you a dancer?" And she said, "I'm a writer" and so we met and she was Joyce Carol Thomas.  She's, she's from Berkeley and I found out she was, that she was my roommate in Festac Village.  We were writers not necess--oh the well-known writers lived at the posh hotel in Lagos and the less well-known of us artists and writers and artists, dancers lived in Festac Village right outside Festac.  It was like a real nice housing development with sand all around it, a nice housing development and the government said they would use that housing development for the Nigerian people after the--Festac was over.  So, Festac Village was built to accommodate Festac, but also for the Nigerian people.  I've understood since then I met this nun who had worked in Africa and lived in Africa and she was one of those people who Festac should have happened, should not have happened, that it was a waste of money.  But, I don't feel that way. I believe that it was important, a very significant event that brought together 17,000 people, Africans, and people of African descent couldn't, who, who were in that place in history and it had an enormous impact on me and others.  I have met young Nigerians who still remember Festac, so it had importance to them as well.  I think it had, is a source of pride that Nigeria was able to accommodate, to get itself together to bring together all of those African and people of African descent at that time.  So, it's a source of pride that Nigeria was able to do that good.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've heard that the accommodations were--exceeded anyone's, I mean most people's expectations--
Speaker 2: Our showers were cold, but so what.  We had rice and sardines for breakfast.  That was an adventure, so what.  You know when we went to visit the nice hotel I did taste groundnut stew because I could eat peanuts at the time, and it was delicious.  It was delicious.  I had groundnut stew with, with fish or chicken.
Story_ID: 110312
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said that when you were in Festac [Lagos, Nigeria] in '77 [1977] you got the idea for a play--
Speaker 2: For a series of poems called "The God of Fire", a long love poem told in a series of smaller poems and it would be a long narrative poem and I didn't attach it to any specific mythology, any specific cultural base.  I didn't do that until around 1979, '79 [1979] when I had been working on it for a while.  I have always had an interest in Yoruba mythology.  When I was a student at Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois], I did a long paper on Yoruba culture and I remember running through the rooms--we lived in a suite in NU [Northwestern University] apartments--running through the room singing "Shango" and I remember I got to the window and there was a clap of thunder that greeted me and I fell back like Shango was answering me.  So, in about 1979 or '80 [1980] I decided that the god of fire would be Shango and I showed--
Speaker 1: Was that, what it, which is what the deity is and--?
Speaker 2: He is the fire of thunder and lightning.
Speaker 1: An orisha, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, he is the orisha of thunder and lightning.  My sister, Betty Jean [Jackson], who is an actor and dancer, choreographer, and director--now she's into film--read a poem to "The God of Fire" and she said this has to be on stage, and I sent the poems to [HM] Woodie King, who was one of the co-producers of "For Colored Girls" [for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf by Ntozake Shange] and he said it needed to be grounded.  It needed to be put into story form to be on stage.  So, I set about transforming the poems to play form and that is what I did with "Shango Diaspora" from like March to June of 1980 when I was supposed to have been working on my master's thesis from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] I did the play instead, that's why I didn't finish my master's until years later.  But, I also had issues with the university, that's also why I, at least didn't finish 'til years later.  At least I wasn't like that woman who recently set fire to the building (laughter), but in any case--
Speaker 1: This happened this past week.
Speaker 2: Just this past week.
Speaker 1: --Somebody actually tried to burn the place down.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, because they gave her too much work. Strange.  But in any case I did complete the play in June.  Soyini Madison was, was, was, was egging me on to complete it because she wanted to be in it and Betty [Jackson, her sister] was, had urged me on at the very beginning to do it, to even translate it to stage and I had hopes that Betty would be in it too, and she wound up being the choreographer for it and Soyini of course originated the part and it turned out beautifully.  The first time it was done in October of 1980, so I was very, very lucky with "Shango Diaspora" because it was my first play, my first--I had had a theatrical production "Witness: a Voice Anthology of Poetry and Fiction" by me done by eta [Creative Arts Foundation] in 1978, but my first authentic play was "Shango", and I was very, very lucky with it because I finished it in June and it went up.  It was produced in October so beautifully by the Midwest Black Theater Alliance and it pulled from the talents of all the different theater groups in Chicago and the production turned out to be simply magical and I could not have dreamed anything more beautiful.  It was even more beautiful than my dream of it, so I was incredibly lucky and blessed by that moment in time, and my mother was there and Hoyt Fuller was there and this was only, this was less than a year before his death.
Story_ID: 110313
Speaker 1: The play went up in October, October 11th, 1980, and he [Hoyt Fuller] died May 11th, 1981.  And after he saw "Shango [Diaspora]" he said something like, "If I should die tonight I would have been in effect fulfilled by this, by this event."  And I remember thinking, "Don't say that" and I was so moved I was in articulate at that time.  It was an exceeding joyful moment for me because everything was just right.  Soyini [Madison] was just right as Ms. Waters.  Roosevelt, I think, I can't think of his last name, was wonderful as Shango.  All the women were just perfect.  The choreography was superb, everything.  The music was sublime.  Everything was just, just perfect.  And my only regret is that it was not videotaped.
Speaker 2: It was never videotaped?
Speaker 1: It wasn't.  I asked [HM] Abena [Joan Brown] about videotaping, and she it wasn't room enough in the place for the video, for the camera to go in the, in the, in the place, so that is--
Speaker 2: Even with the version that eta [Creative Arts Foundation] mounted a few years later.
Speaker 1: That may have been videotaped, but that wasn't--
Speaker 2: The first one wasn't.
Speaker 1: --the first one wasn't and I think the first one--years later someone, a critic whom I will not name tried to tell me, "Maybe it wasn't as good as we thought it was (laughter)."  Another critic told me, "Oh but actually it was so common."  Another critic told me, "It was just like "For Colored Girls"," so critics will tell you all kinds of things.  That's why I don't pay too much attention to them because I myself am a very critical person as an artist and I'm a very harsh critic of my own work, you know, so, and having spent twenty years in a workshop I can be, tend to be my own guide.
Speaker 2: Well, from someone who saw it and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Plus I saw it.  I know what I saw.
Speaker 2: I thought it was--it was the first time I really seen African mythology or cosmology used in a, in a contemporary story that, with, with some effect, you know, where it really was effective, you know, and with the dancing and music and the colors it was really what [HM] Paul Carter Harrison was describing as a New Yorker as real--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --African theater--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --in, but with a, not just continental African theater, but--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with an appeal to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --African people all over.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah and it didn't have to try to pretend to be African in order to be African.  It was African, yeah, yeah.  So, I was very pleased with it and very, very happy about the whole thing.  It was really wonderful.  So, it's had different versions.
Speaker 2: Has it been produced in other cities?
Speaker 1: It was produced at Karamu House, but I didn't see in Cleveland [Ohio], I didn't see it, and one of the eta [Creative Arts Foundation], the, the Useni [ph.] Productions went to Barbados, but that would have been the same as one of the, as, as it was done at eta, so a group in Louisiana wanted to do it this year or next year, but they're right outside where Katrina was.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it made it--yeah.
Speaker 1: So, I don't--I'm not anticipating that it will be done there soon because Louisiana is in such trouble.  They have deep troubles.  Yeah, and they showed me the theater where they wanted to do it and everything so.
Story_ID: 110314
Speaker 1: Okay, now we're around 1980 now and of course the play was redone in the mid '80s [1980s] I guess by eta [Creative Arts Foundation]--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but, okay now where are we in terms of poetry now in this, in the chronology here?
Speaker 2: Well, of course "Shango" was initially poetry and it was poetry until 1980, though it never saw book form.  I sent it out, but it never, it never became a book.  I published in 1978, "The Greenville Club" was published as a chapbook inside a collection of four black poets.  That was published by BookMark Press [BkMk Press] of Kansas City [Missouri].  In 1985, "The Man with the White Liver" was published by Contact /II as a pull-out of their magazine.  It was republished as a separate chapbook in 1987. Now I'll tell you how "The Man with the White Liver" came into being.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: "The Man with the White Liver" is a tiny chapbook of three poems, "The Man with the White Liver", "Dr. Watts", and "Mules of Men."  These are poems that come out of African American folklore, and they came directly out of the Midwest Black Theater Conference that was held in 1980--I think it was '84 [1984], that was held in 1984 at, in St. Louis [Missouri].  I went to a workshop by [HM] Phil Cohran and I learned about Dr. Watts, that sound that was recorded by a musicologist named Dr. Watts, and I wrote the poem about that sound and Dr. Watts.  Then I wrote the poem, "Mules and Men" based upon Zora Neale Hurston and "Mules and Men" and "Their Eyes were Watching God," and I wrote the poem, "The Man with the White Liver" based upon a conversation that I was having with Joan McCarty and Jeff Donaldson and Joan was telling us how she went to a funeral and the women were whispering in the kitchen about they said you know he got a white liver and we went, Jeff and Joan and I went all around St. Louis that evening trying to find somebody who knew what a man with a white liver was, and finally we got to this bellman and one of the maids of the hotel and she pointed to the man and he stuck out his chest and she said he got a white liver and he stuck out his chest, so we surmised what a man with a white liver was.  I did further investigating asking older people and I asked a friend of mine, my friend Janet Sankey's mother was really afraid when I asked about a man with a white liver and she said tell Angela to stay away from a man with a white liver, you know, and I put that into the poem, because a man with a white liver, as we were just talking about, is an oversexed man, but the other side of the, of the folklore is that he is an oversexed man who causes his wives to die young, you know.  So, I don't know how I got to that part, but I got that part, so, so it's two versions of it, so and I put that into the poem.

Speaker 1: What else was I doing with poetry?  In about 1983, I went to the De Rossi Foundation in California and I went to the mountains, up into the mountains of California and I was in the midst of nature just all around me was nature and this was April of '83 [1983] I believe it was and I fell in love with spiders at that time; they were all around.  And one of the women there had a book called the "Book of Symbols" and it talked about spiders and their meaning in different cultures and the book was in French and she translated for me the meaning of the spiders in different cultures and one night I sat down and in a burst wrote about seven poems about spiders, one for each culture.  So, that spring in 1983 led to a nine-year investigation and meditation on spiders that culminated in the book, "Dark Legs and Silk Kisses:  The Beatitudes of the Spinners" which was published by Northwestern University Press in 1993.  That book was awarded the Carl Sandburg Award and it was awarded the "Chicago Sun-Times" Friends of Literature Book of the Year Award in 1993, 1994, so that was what I was doing poetry and I was continuing to write other poems and publishing other poems as well.  I had a poem that won a Pushcart Prize [1989] that was published in Callaloo called "The Love of Travelers."  It continues to be one of my favorite poems.  It was about a trip to Mississippi that I took with Sandra Jackson-Opoku and her sister Cheryl and her mother Doris.  We went down to Greenville and Leland, Mississippi.  I went to Greenville, they went to Leland to see relatives there.  I wrote poems while I worked at Stephens College [Columbia, Missouri] from 1983 to 1985.  I wrote poems and wrote fiction.  I wrote the novel, "Treemont Stone," which I had completed once in 1982 and sent out unsuccessfully to Toni Morrison who was just leaving Random House.
Story_ID: 110316
Speaker 1: Now what is "Treemont Stone" about?
Speaker 2: "Treemont Stone" takes place from 1967 to the early 1970s, and it's about the hope for heroes and the preservation of heroes.  It's a coming of, it's a Bildungsroman, a coming of age story, the story of Magdelene Grace called Maggie Grace.  The funny thing is recently I discovered a white actress named Maggie Grace.  She plays on Lost or used to play on Lost, so I said, "Oh my God." Johari Amini said, "Can you change your girl's name?"  I said, "No I'm not changing her name.  Her name has been Magdelene Grace, called Maggie Grace for over thirty years; I'm not changing her name."  So, I been writing, I, I worked on that novel for over thirty years and I kept writing poems and I, I had a collection of poems published, my selected poems was published in 1998 and "All These Roads Be Luminous" was published in '98 [1998], and it was nominated for the National Book Award.  Since then, I've finished a collection of poems called an "Island in Time", but I don't have a publisher for it yet, and I'm working on another collection of poems.  I'm also trying to revise a play called "Lightfoot:  The Crystal Stair".  It was too long to be, for eta, but another theater company is interested in it and eta is interested in it if I edit it.
Speaker 1: It's called Lightfoot?
"Lightfoot:  The Crystal Stair", so, and I'm working on a collection of essays called "Apprenticeship in the House of Cowry Shells:  The Life of the Writer."  And the cowry shell of course is this, which is a symbol for money and also I read an article on Black Literature Forum it's a symbol for language, so I have taken this to be the symbol for myself as a writer and a symbol for black women because black women wear cowry shells all the time, so.
Story_ID: 112051
Speaker 1: Okay, I was--I read--there's a piece about you on the internet in preparation for this.  We scrambled around trying to get some research together and one thing I read was a, just a couple of paragraphs you wrote that, where you, I think you, where you talk about your early influences and how they are still your influence, still the garments that you wear I think that's how you put it in terms of black aesthetic and the importance of cultural in that regard--of a black culture as opposed to embracing the popular culture.  Am I--do you remember the piece?
Speaker 2: No, you got me mixed up with somebody else because I, in my fiction I even use, I manipulate popular culture.  I use horror movies and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what it-that's what you--
Speaker 2: --different kind of stuff to--
Speaker 1: --well, that's what the article referred to.
Speaker 2: Yeah I do use--
Speaker 1: But you use it in a different way than just, I mean you're not--
Speaker 2: Yeah I co--comment on society through horror movies and science fiction movies and even soap operas.  You know I use them to, to make statements about the culture, about the dominant culture, yeah and about African American culture.  Yeah, so I don't just use African American culture, I use popular culture, American culture as well.  I use it against itself, that might be a use it in a subversive kind of way probably, yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what the article seemed to suggest, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Where did you find this article?
Speaker 1: On the internet.  It was right here-I don't know if this is proper but here you go. Here it is.  Well I don't know if it's a good idea to read it now from cover to cover (laughter).  It's just a couple of paragraphs.
Speaker 2: I don't even remember writing this.
Speaker 1: Is it you?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right as long as it not, somebody is not masquerading as you.
Speaker 2: I can't believe--gee I'm smart (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, that's what I was thinking when I read it, but.
Story_ID: 112052
Speaker 1: So, you're, you're teaching, now you've been teaching for quite a while, what you teach, where do you teach now?
Speaker 2: I teach at, at, right now I teach at Kennedy-King [City Colleges of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois].  I teach, I'm just a comp teacher at Kennedy King, yeah.  I have taught, I taught--at Stephens [College in Columbia, Missouri] I taught fiction writing and playwriting and black literature and black women writers and black women playwrights, and I taught--at Columbia College [in Chicago, Illinois] I taught poetry writing, comp, and--oh at Stevens I also taught composition.  At Columbia College [Chicago, Illinois] I taught introduction to poetry, poetry writing, one comp class, and black folklore and mythology and literature, which I loved doing.  At Framingham State [University in Framingham, Massachusetts], I taught poetry writing and fiction writing and black--African American literature.  At Howard [University in Washington, D.C.] I taught poetry writing and fiction writing and advanced essay writing.  And at Ken--and at School of the Art Institute [of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois] I taught poetry writing and now I just teach comp at Kennedy-King [City Colleges of Chicago in Chicago, Illinois].  It's not my favorite thing to teach, but I do like my students most of the time.
Speaker 1: I wondered if you were someone who, I mean a lot of people of your stature have tenure some place, I mean, you know, they have a nice situation on a campus, do you hanker for that kind of thing or would you rather be, just write?
Speaker 2: That's the question that I've been asking myself for the last year or so, for the last, especially the last few months.  I have been asking myself actively, would I rather just write? Or would--I know I don't want to be contained.  I don't what to be too burdens with--too burdened with a lot of classwork, but I'd like to be in the position I think to be able to teach, to teach some and to write.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 112053
Speaker 1: What are, what are your future plans?
Speaker 2: I'm still waiting to hear about my novel "Treemont Stone" if and when it will be published.  It's being read now, and that will make kind of the difference for a lot of things I think.  My editor, my poetry editor, Reginald Gibbons, seems to think that "Treemont Stone" will make a big difference for me, and I hope that it does.  I'm thinking about getting another graduate degree, though I'm not sure how I can manage that, but I'm really seriously thinking about it hoping that it would make a difference for in the way I would be able to live my day to day life.  But, I know I'll always write no matter what.  Right now I'm, I'm taking notes for another novel and writing poems and revising a play and when I get around to it I'll work on another essay for my essay collection that [HM] Haki Madhubuti has said that Third World Press will do.  I don't know when, but I'm not even interested in, in the, in the essay collection being published until the novel is published, so I have a lot of writing that I do.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're working on a novel that you're taking notes for a novel at the present time?
Speaker 2: Yeah and I, I am also adding to a collection of short stories.  I have most of it wrote.  I just need to type 'em.  Most of the story is done for a collection of short stories.
Story_ID: 112054
Speaker 1: Okay, now will you--now was this Sandra Jackson or you too, or you, are you writing like novels too, I mean, like short novels for popular consumption--(unclear)--?
Speaker 2: At one time in the early '80s [1980s], it was published in 1982 I co-authored pseudonymously with Sandra Jackson-Opoku a novel called "The Tender Mending."  It was written by the mythical Lia Sanders who was a combination of the both of us, and it was a well-done little effort and all the while we were doing it we were very aware that we were writing a light entertainment novel.  The problem that I have with much of the fiction that is being written now that is entertainment, that are entertainment novels is that the writers don't know that they're writing entertainment novels.  They think they're writing serious fiction; you know the difference.  And I think they ought to be aware of when you're writing just for a passing fancy and when you're writing for something that you hope wants to be more for people, wants to reach people in a deep and profound and lasting way.
Speaker 1: [HM] Abena Joan Brown used to always talk about the responsibility of the black artist to go deeper--
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: --than this surface experience.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And in fact any artist I supposed would have to, but especially for us it seems like it's, if you don't, you're, you're in a lot of, you're in more trouble if you don't go deeper.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  I suppose that I could turn out something and make some quick cash, but I'm older now and I really don't have time to fool around.  I really want to write something, words that endure, words that transform myself and other people, words--
Speaker 1: Can I ask you what, I'm sorry, did I interrupt the last part?
Speaker 2: No, that's okay.
Story_ID: 112055
Speaker 1: Yeah, can I ask you what you're working on, I mean what the subject matter is that your writing now is into--
Speaker 2: No, I'm still working with the same characters and fiction that I had been working in before, but I wanna say I'm, I'm writing about how, how difficult and surprising and wondrous and short life is.  Even if you live 100 years, it's still short.  And in poems I'm writing about the same thing, I'm writing about the different dimensions of the human heart.  And I'm also responding to events.  I wrote a poem about black history and in its relationship to [Hurricane] Katrina and I wrote a poem about the drought in Niger and just, you know, I, I write, in poems I try to write--and in fiction and in plays--I try to create what I call a holistic art, not just is on the surface propaganda, but which addresses the whole dimensions of the person.  I mean, we're not just slogans or rhetoric we also have day to day concerns.  We, we die in car crashes.  We get cancer and die.  We, you know, we grieve, we fall in love and marry, or we don't marry.  We, you know, I try to write about all of that.  We have to try to pay bills or try to figure out a way to pay bills without robbing a bank.  We, you know, we, we are real.  We are human, and we are whole, and I try to portray that in my art.  I try to affirm that and I try to transform our weaknesses, my own weaknesses to heal them and I try to dream dreams for us as well.
Story_ID: 112056
Speaker 1: Okay, we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: I would hope that we would be--I'm thinking about, I'm thinking about the black middle class, but I'm also thinking about the working class.  I would hope that we would be a little less materialistic and a little more sharing.  I think people gave during the first days after [Hurricane] Katrina happened, but I think that we should remember to keep giving and remember to make giving a part of our lives, to give in whatever ways that we can.  That may come from my Christian upbringing, but I think we have a responsibility to give to each other.  And also I'm not saying give away yourself, you know, or, or you dishonor yourself, but don't be so materialistic and don't--I think we should care more about Africa.  One of the things that Hoyt Fuller said, would always say that we are not free until Africa is free and that is what Pan-Africanists have said all through our history that our fate in the United States lies upon how Africa is, how Africa is in our present and Africa is not--as far as I'm concerned--not doing that well right now because of AIDS and drought and famine and the institutions of colonialism that still reside there that have been carried over in black face, you know, because of tribalism and, and I'm concerned about tribalism here.  I'm concerned about sexism and the, the, the pervading misogyn--misogyny, you know the way, the betrayal of women and the way women accept it gladly and participate in it and I'm concerned about the way women treat other women, the disrespect that women heap upon other women.  So, lots of things concern me about our community.
Story_ID: 112057
Speaker 1: Okay, if you look back on everything you've done to this point is there any major thing that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: I'd finished school quicker and have a Ph.D. (laughter), so these people wouldn't be fooling around with me (laughter).  Yeah, I would, I would be more, I would be more focused academically.  You know because I see these people--some people managed to, to do well in the world--I don't even know how to put it, but I think you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Would--a credential helps a lot.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah even though I have, I have a B.A. from Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] and a master's from the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] they keep, they always seem to keep raising the hoops for me, but you know, and I had got the Shelley Award from the Poetry Society of America and all these other awards for my writing, but I, I could, it never seems to be enough for me for some odd reason, but I was just, when I was coming, oh I was coming from some place in the--(unclear)--and I was thinking of that Eddie Kendricks song, [singing] "Just keep on trucking baby" (laughter), and the important thing is that I am a writer and nobody can take that away from me.  And one thing that I was struck by when I first started my college days at Northwestern in those days we used to talk about, they used to talk to us about, entrance students about being devoted to the life of the mind and I'm committed to the life of the mind.  I'm also more interested in health issues as I have, as I face health issues myself.  I would take better care of my body and I'm learning to do that now.  I'm doing much, I'm doing a much better job of it now.  I'm devoted to a holistic sense of health in terms of the life of the mind, the life of the spirit, and the life of the body.  I'm determined to be a whole person and that's what I'm, that's one of the things that I would present, that I would hope for, for our community that we would, each of us want to be whole people, be, be concerned with the life of the mind, the life of the spirit, and the life of the body.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's what I'm gonna try to present in my art.
Story_ID: 112058
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at your life at this point again what would you consider today to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness, my art.  I don't have any children, but I do have, but I have had some influence over, some influence not over, some influence with my nieces and nephews and great-nieces and nephews.  So, I know that there are lives that I have impacted, and I have impacted the lives of some students.  Whether or not they credit me or not I, I think that I have influenced some people and helped some people along the way, but I know that I have impacted people, influenced people through my art, through my writing.  I know that I have reached people.  I know that my words have found people and connected in a place where they needed to be connected.
Story_ID: 112059
Speaker 1: Before I ask the last question, is there anything I haven't asked you that you think you should, you should raise before we ask the last one?
Speaker 2: Oh, I forgot to tell you about my piece I did on Ida B. Wells and how she is an inspiration to me because she is one of my foremothers who was so daring and, and who spoke so bravely and who was so independent-minded, and yet she was a happily-married woman and I, I liked that about her.  I liked, I liked the fact that she married late and, and helped raise her brothers and sisters and, and led the anti-lynching campaign and would go where men were afraid to go to get the news to report it to black people so that we would know what was going on, what was being done to us so that she could rally the nation in the interest of the anti-lynching movement.  And I did a one woman show with Bethany Pickens at piano in 1998 on her, and I've been toying with the idea of doing a play about her and her husband Ferdinand [Barnett], but I don't know yet.  I gotta get out Lightfoot first before--
Speaker 1: You would like to do it though at some point?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It is important so.
Speaker 2: Yeah and that's, that's a story.  I, I wanna see more love stories, more solid and beautiful love stories and that is an authentic love story out of our history, you know, and it should be lifted up for all to see.
Story_ID: 112060
Speaker 1: Okay, well I want you to read us a poem too and you will do it after you answer this last question.  You got something you gonna read for us right?
Speaker 2: I don't know which one to read.
Speaker 1: Well, what's your favorite?
Speaker 2: "The Love of Travelers."
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: Oh you want me to read the "The Man with the White Liver" (laughter).
Speaker 1: --No, no, not necessarily.
Speaker 2: I don't have enough energy to read "The man with the White Liver."  I wanna read this letter.
Speaker 1: Okay and last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  I thought about that.  One day I was in my study when I lived at 939 East Hyde Park Boulevard, and I remember thinking, "I would like for fifty years from now" and actually that was like twenty years ago and not that long ago, so I, I wanna say it now I would like 100 years from now a young black woman or black man to pull one of my books off the shelf and just be able to fall into it and find themselves in it and then I decided it doesn't have to be a young black man or a young black woman, just a young person, just, you know, an eager young person, but I really wanna reach young, young black--I want--because, well I hope that the images, the need won't be as great for those images then as they are now, but I just want for younger people to be able to find themselves in my work and to be able to become more whole human beings along their adventure.
Speaker 1: Okay, well thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: It's been a pleasure.
Story_ID: 112061
Speaker 1: No, I'm gonna read "Faith".  I'm gonna read a poem called "Faith."
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause I've been, I've fallen in love with this poem again recently.
Speaker 2: Okay can you kind of introduce it for us?
Speaker 1: Well, this is a poem that's drawn from a memory in my childhood when we would watch boys jump in the backyard.  We would watch boys jump from one garage to the next garage, okay.  "Faith."  Long leg--longlegged boys leapt from rooftop to rooftop. The dark between their legs widening as they spread.  We never questioned the quiet behind the house until the boys made their legs scissors and cut it.  What we thought could not be cut, as it was made from the stones on the floor of the alley below, the eaves above the garages that slanted, so standing there was an art and lifting off a greater one.  They could have fallen, but they would not have fallen. Gifted by heaven to lose gravity in the dark, gain grace enough to make girls weep to follow, all of us, even looking up born anew in midair, no longer grievingly human, mute.  The wind in our mouths. Each breath big, sweetened with amazement.  Once black boys, innocent as angels, leapt from rooftop to rooftop.  Full splits on the floor of dark air, each time a happy ending.  Isn't that enough?
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Thank you.

Speaker 1: This is at an early reading of mine.  I don't know what year it is.  It must have been--Marcus looks to be--this must be about 1975 and next to me is my cousin Willie Mae who is a character who appears in several of my poems.  There is my nephew Marcus and his mother Sharon Marie, my sister, who works at UIC, has worked there for many years.
Speaker 2: That's me in my high school picture again.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Didn't we do that one?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we did that one, yeah.
Speaker 1: At the top is my cousin Mildred.  The bottom is--
VIDEOGRAPHER:  --(Unclear)--bottom right.
Speaker 1: The bottom right there is my parents, George [George Jackson, Sr.] and Angeline Jackson at a party at our house.  When I was a teenager and we had wonderful parties at our house and our parents were always there to watch over us to make sure that nothing bad happened at our parties.  Our parties at 55th and Wentworth were famous among the college students because my brother was at Loyola [University], my sister was at St. Xavier's [College in Chicago, Illinois], and I was at Northwestern [University in Evanston, Illinois] and we had students from all of those schools there.
Speaker 2: That's Cecilia Anne Velasco, Eugene Redmond, and a woman from his, Eugene Redmond's writers workshop and me at an Illinois Arts Council function in the late 1980s.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Next.
Speaker 2: That's my sister Debra, my father, me, and Mama at LaMont Zeno Theatre on the west side during the premiere of Shango ["Shango Diaspora" by Angela Jackson] at that theater.  It was 1981.  It was, yeah it was not too long before Hoyt Fuller died.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Next.
Speaker 2: At the top is my passport picture on my way to Africa to Festac [Festac 77 in Lagos, Nigeria].  The photo was taken by the famed photographer, John Tweedle.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay next.
Speaker 2: That is the Jackson corner store in Greenville, Mississippi.  My father and mother owned that store and when my father was in Chicago my mother was running it.  There's my mother holding my sister, Rose, and next to Rose is my Uncle Joe, Joseph, my father's brother.  In the foreground is my sister Delores, Loli, and next to her is my brother, George.  He was the Assistant Commissioner of Water in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Yes that's a picture that I took of Hoyt Fuller in OBAC [Organization of Black American Culture] headquarters December 2, 1971, and he wrote Ms. Jackson you really do have to learn to focus the camera.  He didn't know I probably needed glasses like I'm wearing now, but I like the idea of the shot because that was that wonderful OBAC sign that was in the back room and there he was and he was the reason that OBAC existed for so many years.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay next.
Speaker 1: These are ancestors, but I don't know whom.  I think they're on my mother side.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Next.
Speaker 1: That's me at my graduation from high school [Loretto Academy High School in Chicago, Illinois].  We wore wedding gr--wedding gowns for our graduation, not the traditional robes and we carried a bouquet of roses.  We graduated in St. Cyril's Church.  It was May 26th, 1968, the same day as my parents' anniversary.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay next.
Speaker 1: That's me and my father at my cotillion in December of 1967.  It was held in Hales' gym [Hales Franciscan High School].  It was a lovely occasion.
VIDEOGRAPHER:  Okay next.
Speaker 1: That's me in a photo taken by the photographer, Jim Curly [ph.] in Columbia, Missouri, in 1984.  The rings are by Babatunde, and I used to wear them all the time until I lost my magic, but I'm getting my magic back (laughter).
