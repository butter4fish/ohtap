Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Today is November 20, 2007 and my name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with  the OSU Library. We   re doing an oral history project called Women of  the Oklahoma Legislature and today I   m with Bernice Shedrick from  Stillwater  Oklahoma  in her law office here in Stillwater. And she  served in the Senate from    81 to    96. Is that correct?  That is correct.  Thank you for joining us today.  My pleasure.  Let   s start by having you tell us a little bit about your childhood and  then we   ll work forward.  I was born in Chickasha, Oklahoma on August 9, 1940 to Irene May  Williams-Link and Arthur Cole Link, Sr. And of my two parents, I was  the oldest of four siblings. Both of my parents had been married before,  both had deceased spouses, and both had children of a prior marriage.  But there were the four of us who were reared in the household together  along with an older half-brother, Robert, who was about seven years  older than I. We all grew up there until both of my parents died. My  father died when I was approximately 11 years old and my mother when  I was 13. My older brother was serving in the Korean War during that  period of time. He was married. His spouse, who was just a 19 year old  young woman attending, then, what was called Oklahoma College for  Women in Chickasha, Oklahoma, came out to our home and helped take  care of the four of us for a very short period of time. And to her, to this  day, I owe a great deal of gratitude and appreciation for her attempt to  keep the four of us young siblings together, though we were later  separated. Each of us went to live with a family member.  5  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  I went to live, though, with my older brother and my sister-in-law,  Sherry. He later returned from the Korean War and then decided to  finish his undergraduate college. First of all, we moved from Chickasha  before he came back from the Korean War. I moved from Chickasha,  Oklahoma to Wynnewood, Oklahoma with my sister-in-law who was  only six or seven years older than I but quite a role model, quite a role  model. She was a very intelligent woman, still is   full of life and had a  lot to offer in the rearing of her young little sister-in-law. And so we  moved there because that was her hometown and her parents still lived  there. So I got to be the new girl on the block. And I was fortunate  enough that year to be elected president of my class, which was  freshman class of my school and I was elected as cheerleader. So that  really helped my self-esteem from having lost both of my parents in a  very short period of time and also to be physically separated from my  brothers and sisters.  Sherry and her family just really accepted me with open arms and we did  a lot of things together as a family. I   m deeply grateful, not only to her,  but to my older brother who is now deceased, but to her family as well.  We later moved to Norman, Oklahoma when he decided to go ahead and  secure his education and later to Edmond, Oklahoma. And that   s where I  met my husband, who we were married for some 32-33 years. We were  divorced, but we remained very, very close friends. He recently passed  away last year.  And that   s what brought you to Stillwater then.  Yes, that   s what brought us to Stillwater. His family was in the jewelry  business and there was a Shedrick Jewelry Store here and so in 1965 or     66 we moved here so he could manage the Shedrick Jewelry Store. By  that time we had three children. Our daughter, Crystal, our middle child,  Michael Scott, and our youngest son, Stephen Link. All Shedrick  children. Our middle child is deceased. He died when he was 24 years  old in 1985.  So you   re going on forty years here in Stillwater.  Yes ma   am.  And so your interest in politics started when you ran for president of the  high school or before then?  You know, actually, my quest to be involved perhaps in political  decisions or decisions that were made by the legislature actually  occurred after I was teaching school here in Stillwater and involved  developing the curriculum of what then was touted as an open school  6  process, which now is Skyline Elementary. But at the time, it was  developed on a lot of theories by Bruno, Piaget and other learning  experts. Our school board at that time decided to try that adventure. I  was on the team with other teachers who, that year, decided to try to  write the curriculum for that new school. And it was our then-superintendent  of schools who encouraged me through that process. We  were trying to select materials and I became a little upset, you might say,  in the way that the state mandated to us that we use only one textbook in  a classroom with 30 to 40 children, assuming that everyone was a very  visual learner, and I knew that wasn   t true. And I thought that   s a real  hardship on a child that   s not a visual learner to give him a book and  say,    Read,    when that wasn   t his best avenue of learning.  When I expressed my concerns to the superintendent, he said,    Well  why don   t you just go down to the legislature with me sometime and  let   s appear in front of one of the committees on education and maybe  you could offer some testimony.    And that   s what I did, first time I was  ever there. It was long before I ever ran for public office or even thought  I wanted to run for office. But I remember walking in that huge Capitol  and it was actually the second time I had been in that Capitol. The first  time is when I was a sixth grader and I went with my sixth grade class  and I was very much in awe, I thought it was a beautiful building. But  that second time I went I was teaching school.  When I went into that committee and I listened to some of the questions  that were being asked of me, and the responses I would give and then  still wanting (Laughs) some information or thinking they needed more  information and making some decisions I thought,    I believe I could do  this. I believe I could do this and I think I could do it very well.    And  later on, I was encouraged by a number of people to consider that race,  and I did. And when I was elected, it was in 1980. There were no other  women serving in the legislature in the Senate. Now there were in the  House of Representatives but not in the Senate. Now there had been two  other women prior to the time I was elected in 1980 that did serve in the  Senate. One was Mrs. Lamar Looney from Hollis, Oklahoma and that  was in the    20s. And the second person was a woman who was from  Oklahoma City and she served only one term.  So when I came, that was it. We had no dual facilities, no bathroom  facilities for men and women. And so I suggested to the President Pro  Tempore at that time that if I was going to serve, I knew how to properly  wait my turn or take numbers, teasingly. It was at that time they decided  perhaps they ought to renovate that antiquated building and realized that  women would be coming to the Oklahoma Senate and perhaps it would  be in the best interest of everyone serving that we have at least two  facilities, for which we did. And so that was the headline story for quite  7  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  a while in that I got a bathroom (Laughs) among other things.  And is it still the same one?  It   s still the same one.  They haven   t expanded any?  No, ma   am. In fact it originally was an old telephone booth that they  turned around and put a door on the other side. Only it was much larger  and much nicer than that of my colleagues, the men were utilizing. So  it   s been there for the women that have come to serve. Unfortunately, in  my opinion there have not been enough women elected in the state  senate. But for those that have, they work very hard to get there  regardless of their political affiliation. And I   m proud of them for  making that effort because it   s a tremendous effort and an unbelievable  sacrifice that you have to make to be in public office, in my opinion.  And to run a race like that you literally just place everything about you  out there in front of the public and say,    Here I am.    And unfortunately,  in my opinion, a lot of people are attacked not necessarily for one   s own  self or one   s own decision making ability but something to do with their  family member or something that is, in my opinion, not appropriate to  try to win a race on. But that   s not the way races are won in politics  today.  So you ran back in    80     I did.  Did you have a particular strategy on how to go about winning?  Oh yes. I believed, and I still believe today, that I had to get to know my  voters, the people that I would be representing. I believed it would be a  big disservice to them if I was fortunate enough to be elected, to go  down there and cast votes on their behalf if I didn   t know my  constituents. So I walked doors in my entire district two times that year  to get to know as many voters as possible so that if I was elected, and I  was by a very small margin I might say, I wanted to know when I was  casting that vote   I wanted to know who I was voting on behalf of. And  I did explain to my constituents that, at the same time you know, I was a  law school student.  I had just started law school and so I did tell them that I would do my  very best if elected to represent them, but that there would be times that I  knew that due to the circumstances, I would probably have more  8  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  information in my hand about the measures I   d be voting upon and  wouldn   t be able, necessarily, at that moment to consult with them when  there was a vote going on. And that I would use the knowledge that I  had learned along with the ideas they had expressed to me about what  they believed their government should do for them, with them, and on  behalf of them.  Was it was a close race, do you remember election night?  One-hundred and fifty votes, that   s how close it was in the primary. In  the general election, that was the year that Ronald Reagan was elected  president and I had approximately 77  of the vote in my district in the  general election.  Did you ever run against another woman?  No, no. But I did have other opponents during that period of time that I  was in office.  Your first one   was it an incumbent?  He was. He had previously been and was at the time the chairman of the  Higher Education Committee so that was pretty tough and he had been  there for sixteen years. But you know, the same thing I heard on the door  step from the people who elected me was the same message that rang  true to me when I decided to leave the Senate. I knocked on many a door  and for many people, they said,    You know, I don   t have any hard  feelings or any misgivings about the current Senator; however he   s been  there for sixteen years and I think it   s time for a change.    Well at the end  of my sixteen years, those same thoughts came back to me and I thought,     You know, I believed it then and there   s absolutely nothing that I have  seen up here since then that has changed my mind. And I think that  sixteen years is enough. And I think it is time for me to go home.     Plus the fact that I was then   I   m fortunate to have two grandchildren  and expecting our third and I really, really wanted to spend quality time  with my grandchildren because you just don   t get overs  do-overs  when  it comes to rearing children and grandchildren. That   s something I  missed out on when I was a child was the input from parents from  thirteen on and especially grandparents. My grandparents were deceased  before I was born. And it was very, very important to me to at least be  able to pass along to my grandchildren some of the history of their  family and thoughts from time to time about wise decision making and  choices that you make and the consequences that come when you make  a choice and how you should think about those choices before you make  them.  9  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Did you live there while you were in session?  No ma   am. I drove every day, back and forth. The only time that I did  spend time at the Capitol overnight was near the end of the legislative  session. I was fortunate enough to be on Appropriations Committee and  the Appropriations Committee has their work cut out for them,  especially the last six weeks of the legislative session. It seems as if you  are in continual non-stop meetings. It seems as if all the information  you   ve been dealing with all legislative session long is now being  updated and that you need to get the most recent information put  together and you need to be in the process of writing the legislation. So  that   s very time consuming.  When I first started serving, we didn   t have a time limit as to the day  that we were to be out of session. So we often went into the summer  months. And the last six weeks of the legislative session, there were at  least a couple of weeks that I would stay down in Oklahoma City  overnight because I never knew whether I was going to be called to  come vote at two o   clock in the morning or have to go proof something  that had come off of the press with my staff at midnight. So you were  pretty much on-call 24/7.  On the swearing in day, do you remember who all was there?  I do. My first swearing in day, absolutely. My family was in the balcony.  I remember standing there looking at the board that had my name on it  and the first thing that really stood out at me was   there are forty-eight  members and I   ve got to have twenty-four votes and mine to pass  legislation. And I started looking around thinking,    How am I going to  do that? I   m the only woman here. How can I be that influential?    And I,  for a few minutes, had a few self doubts about,    Oh, I hope I   ve not  done my constituents a disservice because I intend to be here and make  some decisions that are going to help them.    But I did learn quickly to  read every bill and I didn   t get up to speak unless I really knew what I  was talking about. I very carefully chose the bills that were extremely  important to my district so that when I did make a debate, it was forceful  and it was something that the members of the Senate took seriously and  they knew I was serious.  Do you remember the first one?  No, I   m not sure I remember the first one. But I can tell you this, the first  year I was there was the year that our Pro Tempore decided that the  Oklahoma Legislature was going to attempt to ratify the Equal Rights  Amendment. And of course, I   m sure you   re familiar with the process.  It   s first passed by Congress, but then it has to be ratified by a number of  10  Finchum  Shedrick  the states before it can actually become law, when an amendment to the  Constitution is made. So we were on the short-list. And that was quite a  tumultuous session that year.  I never shall forget sitting behind me was a gentleman who had been in  the Senate for many years, was really a Constitutional expert and here  we are in debate on national TV. I   m sitting, turning looking at him and  the cameras are all on us and I   m the lone woman there and so he is  making his plea and closing remarks. And he said to them,    Gentleman  of the Senate        And I   m right there, you know, as if I   m invisible.    If  you have prayed over this matter as I have, then you   ll be voting    no    on  the ratification.    That really bothered me for a couple of reasons. One, I  was not a gentleman, I was a lady of the Senate and he had failed to even  recognize that. Though I think he is a fine man, I mean I don   t  personally harbor anything I just felt like it was a tragic mistake for  Oklahoma in the eyes of the whole United States for a woman to be  sitting there as a member of the Senate and not even be recognized as a  woman.  And I never held myself out to necessarily be a woman, I held myself  out to be a Senator and I wanted to be a good Senator and I wanted to be  a Senator where my word was good and if I gave it, I kept it. And I  believe that   s the reputation I created. But when he made that statement  and told them that he prayed over it, I jokingly leaned over and said,     Senator, I too have prayed to the good Lord about this. And she  said         well it just went all over him, you know. And I was teasingly  saying that to him but I just wanted him to get the message and I think  he did.  The ERA ratification did not pass. We missed it by one vote. But there  was a lot of good debate about the equality of wages for women. I mean,  never before had there been this comparison that, at that time women of  the same job descriptions, same education, same everything but for  gender, was making fifty-nine-cents on the dollar as compared to the  gentleman   same qualifications, same job description, making one  dollar. And I think it really created a forum, if you will, to be able to  discuss those issues that were long overdue.  How did the House women stack up with that decision, do you  remember?  There were twelve that year in the House and a good number of them  supported that ratification. I can   t remember the exact vote. They had to  have passed it for the bill to have come to the Senate. It passed the  House first and came to the Senate. And we got down to one vote. We  were trying to get the tie vote because we felt like if we did, we believed  11  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  at that time that the Lieutenant Governor would possibly go with us and  break the tie. I never heard him personally make that commitment and  that was Lieutenant Governor Spencer Bernard, who is now deceased     fine gentleman.  So what other committees did you chair?  I chaired the Education Committee for a number of years. I chaired the  Sub-Committee on Educational Appropriations which dealt with two-thirds  of the state money to be distributed. I, at one time, was on the  Retirement Committee for which during those years we had many, many  problems that we had to fix, if you will, the insolvency of the retirement  funds for the state, and we did during that period of time. I also chaired  the Judiciary Committee as a lawyer after I received my law degree in  1983. And I served on a couple of other committees   the Economic  Development Committee. I was very interested in any aspect to bring  and encourage economic development for our state.  So during those   like    80 to    83 you were a mother, a legislator and a  student.  I was.  How did you juggle all of that?  It was difficult, and with a lot of prayer, a wing and a prayer. I prayed a  lot. I drove a lot of miles, worked really, really, really hard   very, very  hard. But it was something I really wanted to do and something that I  had a commitment to do. I know my husband at the time said to me  when I ran for public office   he said,    I don   t understand anyone  wanting to do this.    And I said,    Well.    Though he was very supportive,  he just said he didn   t understand. I said,    Well, it   s something like  joining the circus. It   s just in your blood.    And his remark was  something like,    Well thank goodness you didn   t want to join the  circus.    But all of my family was very, very supportive. And my  youngest child at the time was sixteen, he had just received his driver   s  license so it was very helpful that he could drive because he could at  least drive himself home after school and I didn   t have to be there to do  that.  Did they visit you when it was in session and watch you, watch mom in  action.  Yes they did, they did. All three of them served as a Page for the Senate.  My oldest child had already served as a Page before I was elected. But  yes, I encouraged them to be a part of the process. We had a lot of  12  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  dinner table discussions. In fact, my children always said,    I can   t ever  remember a meal during those years that when we did sit down at the  dinner table my mother wouldn   t say,    Now this is not for publication,  however, what would you think if           And I would always throw a  query out there. You know,    If you have this problem to resolve, how do  you feel about x?    And it was interesting to watch their reactions.  Would either one of them be in politics someday?  No. At least, they   ve not expressed that to me. Except that, my daughter,  at the time that we passed one of the most comprehensive reform bills,  in terms of education that is, House Bill 1017, in the legislature. My  daughter was president of a local PTA here and so she chose to take her  PTA members   mothers, grandmothers and everyone else   and go  provide assistance for whatever was needed to be done in the classrooms  so that the teachers could come to the Capitol to speak to their legislators  about those issues. And she also organized a lot of parents and  grandparents who likewise came to the Capitol to express to their  legislators and to others the importance of this magnificent education  reform bill.  So she was active in different ways.  Yes, yes.  Can you describe a typical day? Like how early would you get there and  all that?  A typical day   I   m hoping this is typical as best I can remember. But  usually the alarm clock goes off about 5:30 or 6 o   clock and on some  days, depending on whether or not I had to chair a committee which  starts at 10, I would come to the office and see clients sometimes. Before  I was an attorney, I did not have to do that. I would then go to Oklahoma  City, start my committee hearing at 10 o   clock, then sometime during  the noon hour, I would go to my office, close the door, get the bills out  for the day and read my bills that were going to be on the afternoon  agenda.  The entire afternoon while in session, we were voting, discussing,  debating bills. At the same time, my staff members were sending notes  in and out to me,    We need to have you check this.    So I had a lot of leg  work during that period of time. I was either on the floor or going out to  meet with the staff and doing something that we had to do to get a bill  ready for committee. After session was over, generally speaking, I  stayed to make certain that if I had a committee hearing soon, I met with  the staff and we decided what bills were going to be on the agenda and  13  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  we went through each and every bill trying to decide what we could  hear.  And then there were many times there were committee meetings after  session depending on the period of time because the legislative session is  divided into weeks in which you must get all bills out of committee from  the origin of their house and you   ve got another couple of weeks in there  where you must get all bills off of the floor from the origin of their  house. Then that flip flops and you go through another two weeks of  reading through bills from the other house and committee. Then you go  through another two or three weeks of reading those bills from opposite  origins that made it out of committee on to the floor. Once you get  through that, then you have what we call the General Conference  Committee bills. That   s when you have to go meet with usually three  members of the House and three members of the Senate and you hear  those bills and you decide whether that bill is meritorious and if it is,  what is worth saving and what can you do and how you are going to fix  the problem that has developed as a result of the request. So that   s what  we would do.  Sometimes I would have a dinner meeting that I would have to go to  with constituents who would come to the Capitol. There would be a  huge banquet, they expected you to be there. Depending if that banquet  was over at 9 or 10 o   clock or if I had just a general dinner meeting with  other members of the Senate or other members of the constituency from  my district, often times I wouldn   t get home before 10:30 or 11 o   clock  at night. I would have to fall in bed and sleep fast.  And read fast.  And read fast. And then my weekend was spent   on Fridays I would go  to court and do my cases in court. Saturdays and Sundays I was here at  the law office. So it   s a huge, huge sacrifice   huge sacrifice. I don   t  know how the men and women who have very small children adjust that  balance between quality time with their children and serving in the  legislature because it   s extremely demanding.  What was the culture like being the only woman?  At the time, the average age of the gentlemen in the Senate was I   m  thinking sixty-five and I was forty. They   d been there, most of them, a  long time. That was before term limits. You might say it was a club, in  that respect, in terms of fraternalism, so to speak. So there were a lot of  events that I was not included in and I knew it. You know, I knew it. But  I gained their respect, more importantly, by reading every bill and soon  while in session. Many of them would come over and say,    Shedrick,  14  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  what   s in this bill?    Because they hadn   t had time because it   s an  immense amount of dedication you make to be able to read every bill  that comes on the floor before it   s voted upon. Sometimes you don   t get  to it until   there it is.  Did you socialize much with the women from the House?  We tried every chance we would get and we loved it. We just loved that  opportunity. It was great. I must tell you this, that one of the most  exciting times   I served with many fine women in the Oklahoma Senate  and House   but it was especially rewarding for me when one more  lawyer got elected   woman lawyer. And that was Senator Miles-  LaGrange, a beautiful black woman that now serves as a Federal Judge.  And it was interesting because I could be having a conversation with any  of the other women members of the Senate and it wasn   t always in  suspect. But Senator Miles-LaGrange, who I noted on several occasions  when we were in conference together, they   d always go,    Mmm, don   t  know. What are they cooking up?    We   d laugh   we   d laugh.  Do you still keep in touch with her?  I do, I do. She   s a fine young woman.  What about some of the others?  I do. I really try to maintain that contact because I don   t get to see them  as often as I would like and on occasion, though I haven   t been able to  do that in some time and I   m not even sure if they still have it but we  used to have, what we called an Old-timers Night in the Senate   when  men and women who had served since statehood would try to come  back, if they   re still living, would come for an evening in Oklahoma  City and a dinner. It was like walking through the history books of  Oklahoma. It was wonderful.  It would be nice if they still did that.  I   m thinking that it   s been at least two or three years since I   ve been to  an event like that. And I   m hoping that they   ll do it again because it was  wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.  This year would have been a good year     Yes, yes, yes. And we didn   t do it.  Are there any other bills you want to talk about specifically that you are  proud of?  15  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Well, I think perhaps the major piece of legislation that I was really,  really dedicated to, among others, was House Bill 1017 because that was  the biggest, major reform bill we had ever passed in the legislature at  that time. And what it did, it put schools on notice at that time that your  curriculum had to be such that your graduates could matriculate to a  comprehensive university and if not, then your school is going to go on  probation. And that really put back in the individual districts the  opportunity for the local school boards to really do some self-examination  about their schools and the kind and type of curriculum  they knew they were going to have to offer.  And it just so happens that several of our smaller schools were able to go  together and co-op so they could teach physics and they could teach  some of those more advanced classes that allowed their students to be  able to score high enough on a SAT exam to qualify to go to a  comprehensive university in Oklahoma. And yes, it was among other  things, we lowered the class size, we had early childhood education;  wonderful, wonderful, wonderful things were in that bill.  And how did you get your twenty-four votes for that one?  A lot of hard work, a lot of hard work. It took a major, major  conference   democratic conference with all the members of the  Democratic Party and every one of them had to vote for it because  unfortunately at that time we couldn   t get any republican votes. I think  we did get one out of that. Even though Henry Bellmon was our  governor then, whom I respect so very much   he was having a difficult  time getting members of his own party to support it so it was our  Democratic Caucus that came up with those votes and passed, finally  passed that bill. It had passed the House and was up to the Senate and  we did do that and the bill was signed in Tulsa  Oklahoma  and it was in  1990. We had Chambers of Commerce, so many people who stepped up  to the plate on that issue and said,    This is something we must do.     Has it been revisited since then?  Oh yes, there   s been major amendments and different types of  legislation passed that have improved upon it, without a doubt. Yes, but  it was the first time that we had really looked at each and every  individual school without just saying,    Okay, this one we   re going to  close you down.    We didn   t do that, we said,    You stay where you are  but you   ve got to make certain that the students you have are going to  get a proper education. So you, as the local school board, have got to sit  down with your teachers and with your public and decide   how are you  going to see to it that these students get the curriculum they need?    And  most of them did. Some of them didn   t. Some of those schools no longer  16  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  exist but it was their own choosing.  And you did one  a bill  having to do something with the living will?  I did, I did. And it was one of the first, I believe. It was one of the first  years, maybe the second year, the legislature had attempted to legislate  something in that nature. It was the Association of Senior Citizens in  Oklahoma that approached me and asked me to consider doing that.  Because we had nothing on record at that time that allowed, as we do  now, the opportunity for one to make a living will prior to the time you  might need that. And so, yes ma   am, I did. But we weren   t able to pass it  the first year. It took about three attempts before we were able to get  something like that passed into law.  Each session or three years?  Three years. Oh, at least   it might have been four.  Any major disappointments?  Major disappointments? I   m sure there were many. And when I say  many, it   s obvious I can   t remember much because   yes, I know I had  several disappointments but as much as anything, maybe it was a  personal disappointment that I experienced that really, really caused me  some concern. And that   s when a member of the Senate at that time,  who no longer serves, was a chairman and had told me he would be  placing my bill on an agenda and did not do it. It wasn   t until I got into  the committee room and I had many people there   in fact, I   m thinking  it was that living will bill   and it was not on the agenda. I had to find  out about it at the meeting with all of my witnesses called who were  going to testify on behalf of the bill. And I thought that was very  disrespectful.  There were lots of times, many times, when I was chairing a committee  that I was not going to hear a certain bill and if I had been requested to  hear the bill by the bill   s author and I was not going to, then generally  speaking   not every time but generally speaking I would at least try to  make a phone call, if not a written response, saying,    Thank you very  much for your request but I will not be able to put your bill on the  agenda.    And give a brief explanation,    If there are any questions,  contact me.     You also ran for governor?  I did, I really did.  17  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Let   s talk a little bit about that.  Such an exciting time, such an exciting time. It was in 1994 and it was     actually I   m thinking it was like late-April, mid-April that I decided to  make that run   maybe March at the earliest. And the person that was the  person to beat, so to speak, was the then-sitting Lieutenant Governor,  Jack Mildren. He had, of course, been Lieutenant Governor for a number  of years and was running on the democratic ticket. And me, being a  registered democrat, decided I wanted to challenge his candidacy and  did. And so from mid-late-March until September, I put together a full-fledged  campaign, raised over  800,000, closer to  900,000. I traveled  the state, had the glorious opportunity to meet many, many Oklahomans,  had a great experience in seeing people from all walks of life all across  the state and at the end of the day in the primary, we had a run-off  because I had enough votes to force him into a run-off.  And then he won it in the run-off and so I went back to the Senate very  happy that I had made the run and very content that I was going to at  least finish out the last two years of my political experiences in the state  senate because I really respected the Senate. The Senate is the  continuing body of law in this state. Senators get elected for four years.  House members get elected every two years. A governor can only run  and be elected for two consecutive terms   that   s eight. A state Senator  now, even with the term limits, can serve for twelve. So you have that  continual body that stays. To me, that   s the constitutional mind, if you  will, of the legislative process, and I thoroughly enjoyed being there.  What prompted you to run for     For the Governor?  What was your thought process?  Well, again, it went back to a personal issue. I have two beautiful  granddaughters and I wanted them to realize that if you really want to do  something, then you should decide how you   re going to do it and be  willing to accept the consequences of your choice. And I told them, I  said,    This is something that your grandmother really wants to do. I  don   t know if I can win it, but I   m surely going to try. And if I don   t, I   ll  be okay. I   ll be okay. We   re going to make lots of friends along the  way.    I wanted them to know that even if they decide to stay and live in  Oklahoma and later if they want to contribute back as young, mature  adults and older mature adults, that they too, if they wanted to make a  choice like that, they could do it but they had to make certain  commitments.  18  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Did they help campaign any?  Oh, all over the state, all over the state. And how about a little girl that,  you know, was quite little and she says to a person in Wal-Mart in  southeastern Oklahoma,    Would you be willing to vote for my Mimi for  governor? She   s a good Mimi and she   ll be a good governor.    (Laughs)  I had a lot of help from my family. They just put everything on hold and  did what they needed to do and they always have.  Did you have a slogan for your campaign?  I think I had many. I believed in a strong economy. I had a record that  showed that I had worked for a strong economy. I was one of the most  fearless voices in support of quality education in Oklahoma and I really  believed that quality education would indeed be a key to one   s economic  freedom. And I felt very strongly, believed very strongly that we should  have a governor who was going to emphasize strong public education.  Were you the first woman to run?  No.  No. I   m thinking maybe Laura Boyd was.  No, Laura Boyd was after me. When I say that, I know there were other  women. I   m trying to think when. (Laughs) That   s funny that I can   t  even recall but      I   ll have to look.  I don   t believe that I was the first woman to run.  One of the first     One of the first. That is correct.  And your thought process on the day that you left for the last time?  I said good-bye to many wonderful friends. I knew I would miss the  camaraderie. I knew I would miss the respect of my many colleagues.  But I knew it would be   as long as I knew where they were, I would be  able to maintain that relationship and that respectfulness with them. I  wasn   t at all going to miss the fray. I   d had all my share of that. Not to  say that I didn   t enjoy it because I did. I   m a little bit of a tiger when it  comes to attacking certain issues. I   ve always believed that you can  compromise on the issues, but you can   t compromise your principles.  19  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  There were times I had to draw the line in the sand and say,    That   s it.     I   ve been known to take no prisoners from time to time. (Laughs) I don   t  know if that   s good or bad or what. Some of them call me the    Steel  Magnolia    from time to time. I had other names too, I   m sure, but  probably that   s not something you would want to print. But I enjoyed it  all. I enjoyed it all.  How many times did your office change?  My office change?  Different locations.  Oh, well the first year I was up on the fifth floor where all freshmen go,  on the south side. And then the next year, I went downstairs to the  largest office, except for the Pro Tempore   s office, and that   s where I  stayed.  And how   d you get that office?  I worked for it. I worked for it. There was a retiring Senate Pro  Tempore   that   s usually where the past Senate Pro Tempores had their  office and it was next to the outside door that went down the hallway to  all the committee rooms. It was very convenient to get to committees  from there and to get into the chamber. And so I just asked for it.  And you got it.  I did. I did.  You weren   t asked to give it up anywhere along the way?  No, no when I left I had been there   I believe I was in that office  fourteen years, in that particular office for fourteen years. I spent two  years up on the fifth floor because those offices don   t change but for  election years. So every two years there would be an election.  Did you have the same assistant that helped you?  I had two.  That   s pretty good.  And the one that stayed with me over the longer period of time is still  there serving for Senator Morgan. And she   s a valuable asset.  20  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  She knows her district well.  She does. She came up here many times and she knew the constituents  and she was a dear friend.  Do you want to talk a little bit about the Science and Math School?  Oh, well that   s   that was fun, that was fun. Senator Penny Williams and  I worked together to help create that school and we were able to get  Governor Hunt, at the time who was the governor of North Carolina, to  come to Oklahoma and help us discuss this concept with the members of  the legislature to encourage them to help us fund the school. And it   s  been a jewel in the crown for Oklahomans. Many, many young people  have graduated from there who   ve gone on and made major  contributions in science and math to our society. They, at one time, had  the highest composite scores of any school in the nation, year after year  after year. They are always in the top echelon in terms of national and  international competition in science and mathematics. These are students  who, if they had not had the opportunity to come to a boarding school in  Oklahoma City and be taught by highly professional people who were  specialists in their area and mentored, if you will, by physicians across  the street at the OU Medical Center, they would not have the aspirations  that they have and the ability to go on and contribute to society like they  do. We will have a Nobel Prize winner out of that school. There is  absolutely no question in my mind.  And they will have used the library named after you.  They will have used the library many, many, times that is named after  me. And I   m so appreciative and so humbled by that. Actually the  primary movers on that was the Sarkeys Foundation from Norman,  Oklahoma. They went to the board and stated they would be willing to  give a major contribution for the building if they would name it in my  behalf. And unbeknownst to me until after the board approved all of that  was I even notified that that would be happen. We had a dedication a  year ago last March and it was wonderful. It is wonderful always to be  on campus with those students. They are so inspiring   so inspiring.  How tough was it to get it passed?  Very, very, very tough and you can see why. Because in years when we  did not have, in my opinion, sufficient funding, if you will, for all of our  public schools and higher education schools, it was difficult to talk to  members of the legislature who knew their own local schools were not  being properly funded that they would    take money out of the budget  and away from their schools    to have this school in Oklahoma City. And  21  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  it was having to convince them that we all are there to help our districts  but we all have the greater good, which is that of the state of Oklahoma.  You apply based on your ability and that   s how it happened. We were  able to educate them and they realized that this is a step that we   re going  to have to make because this will make a significant difference for  Oklahoma.  Did you attend the first graduation ceremony?  I did, I did.  You were in office too during the Murrah Building     I was. I was on my way to Oklahoma City that morning. It happened,  you know, at nine o   clock. I was ready to exit off of I-35 onto Lincoln  Boulevard when I saw smoke. I had a ten o   clock meeting at the Capitol  and this was right about nine o   clock. I just absolutely could not  imagine, could not even begin to imagine why it was coming from that  direction. But it was major, it was major. And by the time I got to the  Capitol, which was within ten minutes, we were getting notices then  about what had happened. And immediately our Senate went into  session and then we just dismissed for the day. Many of us went down  immediately to the blood bank there to get in line to give blood because  there was a huge, huge need for it.  I remember the days following that and the anger I felt for someone who  was just so indignant to be so non-respectful of human lives, especially  children   babies. My heart just grieved. I didn   t realize that I was  depressed and I finally had to realize why. It was because I just could  not imagine the disdain and the disrespect that any human being could  have for that many human lives.  Lo and behold, I just happened to be in court in Perry  Oklahoma  in  Noble county the next day or two within that period of time   maybe the  same evening of the next day, very close, in which I was waiting for the  judge to finish up a hearing so that I could propose a bond hearing for a  person that was in the Perry jail that I was representing   to lower a bond  for this person. It was a minor misdemeanor, it wasn   t anything serious.  And as it turned out, the judge didn   t complete that hearing that day and  I had to wait until the end of the day, which was almost five o   clock  before I got to do my hearing. The judge leaves immediately afterwards  so therefore the person downstairs that we all know later went to trial for  this, remained over night in that jail. And by doing so, they were then  able to put together enough evidence by the next morning that they did  not release him on bond, if you remember. History   history in the  making.  22  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Do you have a favorite campaign story?  Yes, I do. 1980, as I told you earlier I had knocked on doors all across  this district two times. Part of my district was in Lincoln County and in  my campaign I had a little carpenter   s apron that you wear and in it are  these pockets so I could carry my bumper stickers, my door knockers  and all other campaign material that I needed, my brochures. So I   ve  been knocking on doors and I started to go into a restaurant and as I did  this gentleman came over and he said,    Give me one of those.    And I  said,    Excuse me?    And he said,    Give me one of those bumper stickers.  That   s Shedrick, that   s the man I   m voting for.    I just handed it to him  and I said,    Thank you.    (Laughs) I didn   t tell him I was Shedrick.  You wonder if he voted for you.  I don   t know. Well I won that   I won Lincoln County big. So maybe he  did. Maybe he put that bumper sticker on and drove it all over Lincoln  County and helped get a lot of those votes in. But I appreciate it.  Was each campaign a little different?  Yes. This first campaign was not nearly as expensive. That was in 1980.  In 1984, I did not get an opponent. In 1988, I did get an opponent. That  campaign was very expensive compared to the first one and then the  next campaign, which was 1992, I was opposed by the same candidate  that had opposed me in    88 and I did win that again by even a few more  points. And that campaign was indeed very, very expensive. More  campaigns were conducted in those times by targeting the voters,  knowing who your voters were, sending mailers to a specific age group  regarding certain issues and became much more sophisticated.  And more expensive too.  And more expensive, yes.  And you were inducted to the Women   s Hall of Fame.  Yes I was.  The Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame.  Yes, very humbled, very grateful for that.  You   ve had lots of awards over the years from what I   ve read.  Probably the most exciting one was the Henry G. Bennett Award from  23  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  OSU.  That was for what?  The Henry G. Bennett Award is given to distinguished alumni and I  appreciated that very much, especially coming from my university.  And your daughter went there and your granddaughter went there, I  understand.  That is correct. My older granddaughter graduated from there. I have  two granddaughters and one grandson, and my daughter. Of my three  children, it was only my daughter who graduated from Oklahoma State.  My middle child, Scott, graduated from the University of Oklahoma.  And our youngest son, Steve, graduated from Arizona State University.  Now with the grandchildren   my granddaughter graduated and we had a  picture made together of the three generations. In fact, the three  generations have worked here in this law office for many years. When  she was in college, she worked here after school and did many, many  things for me. And my daughter has been in the office here with me for  years and has also run our family business for us.  A legacy family for sure.  It   s fun to have your family at work with you if you can decide what the  perimeters are and how everybody gets along with them and she   s my  best friend   it   s fun.  You   re lucky.  I am.  She   s lucky too.  Currently I   m serving as an Administrative Law Judge part time. And I  do that on Mondays and Tuesdays in Payne County and Logan County  and I do that with the child support enforcement.  And you do something with ethics?  I am, I   m on the Ethics Commission and that   s a major responsibility  too. I   m one of five who work with the ethics laws and trying to  formulate rules that are reasonable but yet rules that require transparency  and disclosure. I think that   s important.  Are you the only woman on that one?  24  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  I am. I don   t think I   ve been the only woman though. But prior to me  serving, former Senator Helen Cole, who I have a great deal of respect  for who is deceased now, was on that commission.  Did you serve with her any, did you all overlap?  I did in the Senate. I enjoyed her so very much   very, very respected  woman. If she gave me her word, she would keep it. I treasured her  friendship too.  Did you have a mentor while you were in the legislative?  I don   t know if I had a mentor but I must tell you there were a couple or  three senators that I really, really enjoyed listening to them debate  because they were so elegant and knew the law and knew the facts.  There were several during the time that I served that I really enjoyed  watching them debate.  Any outside of     Well I enjoyed serving with all of our governors. But I must tell you,  perhaps my most favorite was that of Governor Henry Bellmon. He was  a man that, likewise, would give you his word and keep it. Not that the  others didn   t, because they would too. But I had a special respect for  Governor Bellmon. One of the bills that I passed into law was that of  creating the OSU-Tulsa Hospital   the Osteopathic college. We didn   t  have that. I carried that bill along with Representative Lawrence Gish  and that   s how we created it. And Governor Bellmon was the governor  during that period of time. I knew that I had certain technical aspects  that had to be done all in a limited time span to get that bill off of both  floors and out of the grossing and enrolling and to the governor   s office  and not come back, not be vetoed. And so, I remember working with  Governor Bellmon   s staff and getting the commitment that this is what  we   re trying to do and did we have any problems with that? I respected  very much his judgment. He had a lot of wisdom   he had a lot of  wisdom. You know, knowledge is one thing but I think wisdom is  superb. Having wisdom is wonderful. I think all of us should aspire to  have wisdom.  Were you ever called into the governor   s office unexpectedly?  Oh no, I don   t think so. I would go out there on various meetings but I  don   t recall being called unexpectedly for something.  You were voted Top Ten Legislator for several years.  25  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  I believe I was, yes. Frosty Troy with the Oklahoma Observer did that,  yes.  Well what advice would you have for women who are considering going  into the political arena?  Go for it, go for it. Knowing that when you make that decision, you have  to make that choice like any choice, knowing what your consequences  are going to be. And I just think it   s a worthwhile endeavor. I think I  would encourage any woman to go. I personally respect both men and  women who serve. I really do. And I don   t have any discretionary  feelings one way or the other as to whether you are a man or a woman.  I do want to encourage women to be involved for several reasons. One, I  do believe that many times, especially when it comes to budgetary  issues, small budgetary issues   and I don   t mean to discredit women  because women deal in major budgetary issues each and every day   but  when you   re talking about legislation that   s going to affect the  pocketbook of young men and women   and let   s face it, we have many,  many women in Oklahoma who are single, family heads of the  household. And I just think we need that input. We need to be able to  hear from women who face that on a day-to-day basis. We won   t unless  we get women in who are willing to deal with those issues.  Many of the bills that dealt with women   s health issues were supported  by women. We started many of those issues. We did not have an  insurance company that would pay for a woman   s mammogram before I  served in the legislature. And it wasn   t just me, I had the help of others.  But we had to get men to help. But I don   t think that issue would have  been brought to the forefront as a major issue without those of us who  were women pushing that issue. The neo-natal units here in Oklahoma,  we didn   t have those before women served. I believe it was  Representative Cleta Deatherage who was the main mover and pusher in  the very first one we had, which was at St. Anthony   s Hospital in  Oklahoma City. And without that we would have lost lots of little  premature babies across the state because we had no way to care for a  severe preemie child.  The list goes on and on but most of those deal with health issues,  education issues and budgetary issues of families. And I just firmly  believe that when you get a group of women together who are willing to  talk about their issues, you   re going to have a force to deal with. I think  that it can be a positive force and it would bring issues to the table that  might not be, perhaps, at the top of the list. For years many of the issues  were like,    We   ve got to do roads and highways   we   ve got to do this.     There were issues that didn   t deal with the real needs. Not that we don   t  26  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  need roads and highways, we do, that   s an important part too, but I think  there are issues and they have been addressed and I think they will  continue to be if we get strong women who are going to take that leap  and get out there and run.  Do you have any other advice for them as far as juggling all the other     Oh, it can be done. Women everywhere juggle. It doesn   t matter whether  you   re in politics or what you   re doing. There isn   t a woman out there  who isn   t juggling between her grocery bill and getting the children up.  Even if she doesn   t have children, there are other issues. I do believe that  our young baby boomers right now are juggling majorly taking care of  their parents and taking care of their children. So they   re all sandwiched.  We call them the sandwiched generation but they   re there. It   s just  another aspect of that. And I think that they   ll find support groups.  Support groups are there to help. I   ve seen it happen before and I think it  will happen again.  Okay, let   s see. What have you been doing since leaving office and how  has being in office helped or not helped?  Okay. Well, for one thing, being in office and then being out of office  really helped my law practice economically. It really did, especially after  my governor   s race. I had more clients than I could possibly take.  Name recognition?  Yes, that   s what it was I   m sure. Plus I believe I   m a good lawyer so I  (Laughs) think that helps somewhat too. But yes, that did help. And  since then, when I left, I left because I wanted to spend more quality  time with my family and that   s what I   ve done. That   s what I   ve done.  And I have two offices. I have one at Grand Lake and I spend time over  there, near Afton. And I have one here and I split the time between here  and there. I work with my daughter and my granddaughter and my  grandson. I try to go to Dallas  Texas    Plano, Texas at least once a  month. I burn that highway up because I have an eleven year old  granddaughter there. In fact, when she first started school as a six year  old, I went down and volunteered sometimes once a month, sometimes  once every two months to help her teacher and it was great fun. Great  fun to see her interact with her friends in the classroom and get to be  there like a little fly on the wall and be a part of all of that.  Any plans to retire anytime soon?  Oh, I   m just going to do what I want to do. For me, I want to keep the  gray matter stirred up and I enjoy serving the judgeship that I serve. I  27  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  take the cases that I know I have the quality time to take now and if I  don   t, I don   t take them because I don   t want it to interfere with my  quality time. I want to be able to go and be able to do things with my  family so we can be together. We talk a lot every day. We plan activities  everyday that will include, not just us, but there are things we like to do  to reach out to other people too.  So you accomplished most everything you intended to while you were in  the Senate?  Oh my, yes. I promised the good Lord that if I passed the bar exam  (Laughs) I wouldn   t go on to school anymore. I spent a number of years  in school. I didn   t start college until after I had a family. I was twenty-five  when I started here at OSU and I will forever, forever be so loyal  and so indebted to OSU because I remember when I got admitted, I just  skipped all the way across that campus I was so excited. I had very  young children at that time and I was fortunate to have them in some  preschools close by. My daughter at the time was in first grade. We lived  across the street from the grade school and just within five blocks of the  university. So I would take her there, take the boys three days a week to  their afternoon or morning classes. And then I would attend college  classes and then I   d race home and pick them up and get the boys down  for their nap and be able to get a little bit of studying done before Crystal  came home from school. I enjoyed all of that.  You got a bachelor   s in education?  Yes, and a master   s in education. And then my doctorate degree, of  course, was a JD.  And you were in your forties when you went after that?  I did, I did. I was forty when I enrolled in law school.  Were you one of the older ones?  I was. In fact, my husband at the time just encouraged me so he said,     You   ve always wanted to do this. Go do it.    And I said,    Yes, but I   ll  be forty-three.    And he said,    You   ll be forty-three anyway. So why not  have what you want?    I was so grateful to have that. First of all, it   s  knowledge. It really gives you a lot of knowledge. It also gives you, in  my opinion, it gives me a better understanding of how the common law  evolved from the beginning. And in a civil court of law, it also reminds  me that we are a civil nation and that we resolve our differences in a  civil court of law. And to me, that   s the backbone of how we educate  people along with their educational process but plus the fact to know  28  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  that you don   t take a gun and go out and deal with somebody, or a knife  or anything else. You go to court. You can litigate it in a civil court  room. If you can   t go to mediation and work it out, there   s a person  behind that bench in that black robe. Once the evidence is presented,  there   s going to be a determination that you   re going to deal with. And I  think that is a system that has survived for many years and I think it   s a  great system. I very much approve of the jury system and I am just so  grateful to be able to enjoy this profession.  Are there many women in that same position across the state?  As attorneys?  As judge     Oh I   m sure we do. I haven   t   I   m just an Administrative Law Judge.  I   m not elected District Judge or Associate Judge or Appointed Special  Judges, but we have a number of them that serve, yes. Not enough, but  we have a number of them.  And I think now that at least 50  of the law school classes are women. I  believe that that ratio is at least 50  now. When I started night school at  Oklahoma City University, we had 122 in our class and I think we might  have had twenty women. So maybe 20  at the time were women in  1980. And now we have 50  or pretty close to 50 , if not more.  If we could get that in the Senate and the House it would be great.  That would be remarkable. Many times I would say, at least five or six  times in the time I served in those sixteen years, we used to have on a  alternating year basis, a national meeting of all women elected officials.  And that included mayors, congresswomen, governors, lieutenant  governors, legislators, presidents and vice presidents, which we had  none. You know all of that combined   we never had more than 1,000  nationwide. Now that was in the    80s and    90s. I   m sure it   s more now. I  really aspired then to think,    Oh, we   ve just got to have more of our  gender elected because I just believe in us.     I was asked to go in 1994 to participate in a conference in Argentina in  which I helped young assemblywomen develop their programs along  with four or five other representatives from four or five other countries.  And it was so interesting to watch these women. They were magnificent.  Many of them had come to the United States and were educated in many  of our eastern universities and had gone home and made a commitment  that they were going to improve their country, whether it was running  for congress, whether it was being a medical physician, whether it was  29  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  being the head of the school, whether it was raising money to provide  for health issues. They were doing it. And it was magnificent to  participate. In fact, I met a very close friend of Eva Peron   s and it was  wonderful to hear that history of how Eva and her husband went to Peru,  when they were exiled from the country. And in fact, she helped them  somewhat when they were trying to get back to Argentina.  Special memories.  Mm-hmm, very.  Any other favorite memories you want to get on tape?  I think that   s all I can think of today.  Well you did something with teenage drinking and driving age.  Oh I did. Years and years and years ago.  Okay. And then there   s a bill to place restrictions on use of campaign  funds.  That was the ethics   mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Yes I did, yes I did. I  remember that now. I remember that distinctly. There were limitations.  That was before the Ethics Commission was created.  And you served with Alene Baker who is not with us anymore.  That is correct.  Do you have anything to say about her?  She   s a marvelous woman   marvelous, marvelous woman. Way ahead  of her time. She comes from a long, long line of a family who are public  servants in the Tulsa area. I believe she lived in Turley or Skiatook, in  that area. And she was marvelous   she only served one term, if I can  remember right, in the House of Representatives. Maybe she served two.  A marvelous woman. She was such an advocate of the Equal Rights  Amendment. That   s what stands out most in my mind about her because  she was of the generation that recognized the differences, I do believe.  And then Freddie Williams isn   t with us anymore.  And Freddie was another marvelous person. Freddie was just as  determined in her own little way to get legislation passed and she was  successful in doing it. Freddie was the one that developed breast cancer  30  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  very early on and she was a marvelous spokesperson for women to insist  that women get those mammograms. In fact, she was one of the major  house members on that bill that we finally got the insurance companies  to pay for a woman   s mammogram. They wouldn   t do it. And Freddie  was a major sponsor of that. And perhaps Senator Williams can tell you  more because she served in the House I believe with Representative  Freddie Williams and she knows Alene Baker very well. Yes, in fact,  she I think served as a pall bearer at Alene   s service. She had women  who served as pall bearers. And Senator Williams was one of them.  And then Maxine     Maxine Horner is a marvelous person. I served with her and she was a  great lady. Yes, a marvelous lady. When we passed House Bill 1017, she  gave one of the most remarkable speeches I have ever heard. And she  talked about sitting at the back of the bus and that was such a  compelling, profound speech. I could not move out of my chair.  Was that recorded somewhere?  Oh, yes. A marvelous, marvelous debate. And brought a real  perspective, when you   re standing there seeing this eloquent woman  who was a former water commissioner for the city of Tulsa and had  come to serve in the Oklahoma Senate. She was marvelous. She   s the  one who sponsored the current scholarship program for children   young  people who enroll in it when they   re like, I believe in middle school, and  if they keep their grades up and they   re not involved in any type of  illegal activities then they get their college tuition paid. She was the  major sponsor of that bill. And she pushed for it   took her two or three  years to get it passed but she didn   t give up. And that woman has  tenacity. I have a great deal of respect for her.  Any of the other ones you want to comment on?  Have you had the opportunity to speak to Senator Trish Weedn? She  started in the Oklahoma Senate and while she was there she decided to  go to college and she finished her degree at OU by commuting both to  OU and to the Senate and taking care of her family at the same time. A  lot of respect for her   a very fine young woman.  Similar to you then.  Somewhat. I have some fond memories of her and of all the women I  served with. In the 1980   s we had Senator Cole, we had Senator Weedn,  we had Senator Williams, we had Senator Billie Jean Floyd, we had  Senator Miles-LaGrange. Later, Senator Kay Dudley was elected to the  Senate while I was there. And we all had a picture taken together and it  31  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  Finchum  Shedrick  is priceless to me. Absolutely one of the greatest treasures I have. We  were the six serving women of the Senate at that time. It   s beautiful. It   s  taken in front in the center of the dome area and looking up behind us  are the five prima ballerinas and it   s just a beautiful, beautiful picture.  Well if you don   t have anything else. My last question is when history is  written about you, what would you like for it to say?  Well, I hope that I   m remembered as a caring woman   a caring woman  that had a passion to make a difference and was able to accomplish some  of that.  Well I think you   ve accomplished a great deal.  Well I hope it   s been helpful to others. And if it hasn   t, then I   ve got  some more work to do (Laughs). I   ve got a lot more work to do.  Hopefully the women that come after you will pick up the torch.  Well I hope so, I hope so. I really hope so. I   ve encouraged young  woman many times to follow their dreams, follow their aspirations. I got  to do that. I just often marvel at how that happened to me. I was a little  girl from Chickasha, Oklahoma and I lost both of my parents and  separated from my brothers and sisters. How did I get to be so lucky? I  have an obligation to give back, that I know. That is tattooed to my heart  and my head. Otherwise I don   t think I could be doing any of this.  Well thank you very much for your time.  You   re welcome. It was nice to have met you too. It was a real pleasure.  Thank you for doing this too.  ---  ---
