Gill  Fischer  Gill  My name is Jerry Gill, and today is January 20, 2010. I   m interviewing  Malinda Berry Fischer in her office here in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This  interview is for the O-STATE Stories Project of the Oklahoma Oral  History Research Program. Malinda, thank you for taking time from  your schedule to be with us today and participate in the interview. I  appreciate it very much.  My pleasure.  I   ll give you a little bit of background. Your life has been steeped in  Stillwater and Oklahoma State University tradition. The families of both  your parents are prominent in the history and heritage of Stillwater and  the state of Oklahoma, as well. William Edward Berry, your great-grandfather,  and his five brothers settled in Indian Territory in 1878.  William Edward Berry was a successful cattleman, Indian trader,  businessman and co-founder of Stillwater National Bank. Your  grandfather, Thomas Nelson Berry, purchased land and mineral rights  throughout north central Oklahoma and founded the oil and gas  business, Thomas N. Berry and Company, which you are chairman of  today. Your father, Thomas Edward Berry, was a wildcatter, an  entrepreneur. He greatly expanded the business. Your great-uncle James  E. Berry, longtime President of Stillwater National Bank, served five  terms as Lieutenant Governor of the State of Oklahoma. Your uncle,  William A. Berry, served as Chief Justice, Supreme Court of Oklahoma.  On the other side of the family, your maternal grandmother Malinda  Blanche Wise Diggs was the second female graduate of Oklahoma A M  College (Oklahoma State University) in 1898. So, you   ve had dozens of  family members over four generations who have been former students  and graduates of OSU and highly successful individuals. Wow. Is that a  tough act to follow? I mean, how do you feel about being a part of the  family legacy?  5  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Well, we don   t really pick who we are or where we come from.  (Laughter) It   s been a privilege to be intertwined and such a part of  Oklahoma A M. I grew up   it was Oklahoma A M and Oklahoma  State through a lot of years. It   s been a privilege.  Malinda, I want to visit with you a little further about your family  members later in this interview, but first I   d like to talk about you. You  grew up in Stillwater starting in the late 1930s, 1940s. Where did your  family live at the time, your parents and you and your brother, Tom?  I lived in town at Ninth and Adams. Some called that the Berry Addition  at that time, because it went to the west up where the original hospital  was and kind of in that area. As a real little child, I lived at Eighth and  Monroe. The house is still there. There   s pictures of me playing in mud  puddles. I liked mud; we   d smear it all over us. So, I didn   t move too far  from center. It was only about half a block where they built the house. It  was a brick house. It   s still standing. It   s in bad repair, but it   s still there.  What do you remember about Stillwater when you were growing up?  What did kids do in Stillwater for fun and entertainment, because  Stillwater was a fairly small town at that time, was it not?  Well, we had a basement, which was unusual for houses in Stillwater  because of the clay soil, but we did have a basement. In those days,  when I grew up, we had the polio scare, and children did not play in the  heat. So, we were given roller skates, and mother cleared the basement  which had a concrete floor, and we would just roller skate in a circle for  hours at a time, all the neighborhood kids. (Laughter) We did a lot of  playing outside in the neighborhood. My dad would bring in all kinds of  animals. We had a cage, and we had everything from possums to  squirrels to ferrets to donkeys to worms. We had a worm pit. We used to  have a little flooding in the area, you know. You   d get those gully-washers,  and those crawdads would come out, and we   d go in the water  and get those. I don   t know. There never seemed to be a lack of  something to do. We used to pick vines and hang them on what had been  my little girl play house, and we   d play Tarzan. One of the kids would  be Cheetah   I won   t say who. (Laughter) All kinds of stuff like that. We  went to school, walked to school and took our lunch some days, but  usually walked home for lunch. It was very different.  What were the movie theaters in Stillwater at that time?  Well, we had the Aggie Theater, the Leachman Theater a bit later,  Campus Theater where Hideaway is now, right there at Campus Corner.  That was a smaller one. The Mecca Theater. That was about it. We  loved the Mecca Theater because that   s where Hopalong Cassidy and  6  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  The Three Stooges played on Saturday. (Laughter) That   s what they had,  Hopalong Cassidy.  And, again, where was that located?  It was on the west side between Seventh and Eighth, right in there,  maybe a little bit further down  at 716 S. Main .  Malinda, earlier we were talking, and you mentioned you had some  close friends that you hung out with throughout junior high and high  school. Can you share some of those names with us?  Well, some of it was even preschool. I mean, we   re talking   that   s one  of the things in Stillwater. People didn   t move around quite as much in  those days. It was a different atmosphere, and both of my parents were  natives of Stillwater. They were born in the Stillwater area, so we never  moved, in all of my growing up. Neither did anyone else, it didn   t seem,  very much. The university was not as transient as it is today. Not that it  is transient, but certainly they don   t always stay for an entire career from  beginning to end. But anyway, it was Suzanne Fenton Carpenter, as in  Fenton Office Supply, that is still run by the grandsons of the original  founder. There was Frances Mayfield Smalley, and Tim Smalley was the  doctor here for many years. He   s just recently retired. There was Jill  Roberts, and her dad ran the poultry division of Oklahoma A M at the  time. Lamoine Brittan, her mother Rena Penn Brittan was a professor in  the art department. There   s a room named for her in the art department.  So, there were several of us that have remained friends really since first  grade. Lynn Pitts was another one of them. You may know Lynn; he  played a little football at OSU.  You graduated from Stillwater High School in 1956. Can you tell me  about some of your activities and honors at Stillwater High School?  Well, you   re getting back a long time ago. What all did I do? I did just  about everything that was available to do for a young girl at that time.  We didn   t have physical education, P.E., at high school level. We did  have it in junior high. Funding didn   t allow it. We didn   t know the  difference. Walked to school every day, which now we   re finding was a  good thing. We didn   t have school buses that took us to school. Either  we were driven by parents or   cars, forget it. You learned to drive at  sixteen. I took driver   s training, went on because nobody else competed  to be a top driver of the state of Oklahoma. They had contests in  Oklahoma City. I managed to have good grades. That was emphasized  within the home. I was in National Honor Society. First pass, junior  year, I guess, is when they pick that. I participated in most everything  there was to participate in.  7  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  I recall you that were a cheerleader for a couple of years.  Oh yes, I was cheerleader a couple of years, but not like today   s  cheerleaders, no way. We kept our feet on the ground pretty much. I  think I was a cheerleader because I had such a loud voice. (Laughter)  Do you remember one of your favorite cheers?  We didn   t do too much other than just,    Rah, rah, sis boom bah,    kind of  silly stuff like that. It really wasn   t very clever, but we thought it was  pretty good. Saddle oxford shoes, the socks, the skirts, the big sweaters.  I still have the big    S    with the cheerleader megaphone on it, but I never  needed a megaphone. (Laughter) I   m so noisy.  As I recall, Football Homecoming Queen or queen attendant?  I was queen attendant. Patsy Wright-Sutton, married to Eddie Sutton,  was the Football Queen. I was Pioneer Queen.  Tell me about Pioneer Queen. What was Pioneer Queen?  Well, that was the queen of the school in your senior year, and you were  voted in. I don   t know where you   re getting all this information, but you  must have gone back to an old annual or something. (Laughter) But  anyway, I was that, and Patsy was the Football Queen. I think I   m right  about that.  Do you remember any family reunions or get-togethers? Did you come  out here to your grandparents    home very often? Do you remember  getting together with your cousins and aunts and uncles?  Yes, I came out usually every Sunday. Mother would drive out   at that  time there was only one road, which was considered Perkins Road. It  was not paved. You didn   t have the South Main Street that goes by on  the other side of it, so the entry point was on the east side. But we would  come out, and we were expected to behave. Sometimes we were invited  out   my cousin about my age, we   d come out and spend a night or two  here with our grandmother Berry. That was quite an experience because  we got to fish, we got to go to the beehives. We had some rough  experiences with the beehives. (Laughter) We had chickens, and we had  black snakes, and we had all those things. It was basically a working  farm. The chicken coop, it was gardened a lot, and we had all that, and  we learned to cook a few things. We were expected to do whatever we  were told to do.  I think one of the hardest jobs we had, this house had quite a few  8  Gill  Fischer  Gill  crystals in the chandeliers, which this home was built in the 1920s, my  grandparents    home. We would be put in charge of cleaning all the  crystals. Now, we took each one down by hand, had to lay it out, get it  numbered. So, I guess we learned our numbers and a few things. That  kept us busy for a day. Everybody was supposed to do their part. She   d  usually have grandkids out in twos and threes, which was probably very  smart because she had quite a batch of them. (Laughter)  Speaking of the batch, on Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, Christmas, did  the extended family get together?  Yes, all of the eight children. My grandparents had eight children: five  daughters and three sons. My father was the eldest son but the fourth  child. He was the first son. Most of them lived within the region; several  lived right in the Stillwater area. We would all convene here. Everybody  brought something for Thanksgiving. Also, interestingly, my  grandmother, even then   Oklahoma A M had international students,  and we   re talking about in the    40s and    50s, even the late    30s. These  international people were limited, but many times at Thanksgiving she  would invite whomever was here at the time out for Thanksgiving  because that   s a very traditional American-type holiday. They would be  of many various faiths and customs, and most spoke very good English,  and we as children were expected to sit and listen to their stories of their  birth country. In fact, they sat right where I   m sitting now on the couch,  which is right over there. I mean, I can remember.  One of the more interesting ones I remember was Krishna Huthisingh,  and she was Nehru   s sister. Later, through some opportunities I had  when I was a college co-ed, I went to Bombay, India, and she invited me  to her home. That was kind of unusual because she had been a guest at  my grandparents   , and so therefore, she said,    When people extend  kindness to us, we consider their children our children to care for.     That   s why I was invited. It was quite a story. I   m having dessert, and  she did have someone helping and it was a young man, and all of a  sudden this pudding appears for dessert. Of course, I didn   t know what I  was eating any of the time, mostly, but I   d ask. I was always pretty  inquisitive. But there was all this gold on the top, and I   d never seen  sprinkles or anything. I   m from Stillwater, America. I didn   t know what   it was . Here I am in Bombay with all this gold on the top, and only  mine had the gold on it. I said,    Mrs. Huthisingh,    (now remember I   m  still in my teens)    Mrs. Huthisingh, am I supposed to eat this?       Yes,  my dear. When we welcome our children, we eat the gold.    You eat the  gold. And it was peeled. Interesting, because they have softer gold.  Special experience. When you talked about going to India, but you were,  from what I can tell, fairly mature and polished for your age, probably,  9  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  going to college. Did you travel with your family? Did you take voice,  dance, music lessons, any of these kinds of things for your personal  development growing up?  I don   t know if you remember D. Terry Martin. He is who started Allied  Arts and his wife was Monty Martin. She considered herself an  elocutionist. And Monty and D. Terry Martin had no children but they  lived in Stillwater up on College Circle. I can show you the house. It   s a  mess now, but, anyway, it was a fabulous house, very like a little  English cottage. They were kind of eccentric people, very much in the  arts. They were friends of my mother. I can remember as a young child  being taken to   and I called her Monty because she wanted me to, not  Mrs. Martin. And she had me saying,    How now brown cow,    and  things like that. Mother said,    Now, daughter, we live in a region and  you need to know how people talk differently in all parts of the world.     So, perhaps I was learning at a very young age about speaking and  sitting up straight and all those things because I had my lessons at   I  was probably under ten years old. Then, beyond, Monty followed me  and would tell me if I did a good or bad job whenever she happened to  spot me on something. There   d be a phone call, and I   d be put back in  the harness if I was not standing up straight or whatever. I don   t know,  those things   you   re bringing back memories that are kind of  interesting.  We did not have   or I realize this now, because I never felt like we  didn   t have resources in Stillwater because I just didn   t   children are  where they are, when they   re there. My mother and my dad were  extremely resourceful in exposing us. I think at Oklahoma State,  Oklahoma A M at the time, I was at a very young age taken to most  every theater performance, even though I was too young to be there.  There was good theater at that time. I was taken to all of the art shows,  which are still in the same area as the Bartlett Center. I can remember  Mr. Reed, Doel Reed, who was the first head of the art department, as a  young child. I was exposed to whatever came on campus. That was the  way it was. My friend Suzanne was kind of the same way. There were  several of us girls, and if one mother was going to be doing that then  they   d take the others. You can call it enrichment programs or whatever  you want, but you used the resources that were around you. That   s how I  would put it. (Laughs)  Did you ever take voice or music lessons?  Well, Mrs. Reed, yes. Her house is still here on Duncan Street. I took  piano lessons but I didn   t get very good. No, my voice was pretty bad as  a singer. I was a better cheerleader. (Laughter) Mr. Epperly let me go on  the trips. He was a wonderful   now his son, you know, is in Tulsa, does  10  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  great work in music in Tulsa. He said to me,    Ms. Berry, you have  excellent volume, but your quality is lacking.    (Laughter) You know, as  a kid you just were told straight out. If you didn   t hit the mark, you  didn   t hit the mark.    But you   re welcome to go with us on our trips as  long as you        There were just so many kids in school, students. So,  that   s how I got to go on the music trips: if I stayed real quiet. I kind of  helped him get kids on and off the bus and stuff like that. I can   t sing  worth a hoot.  So, in the fall of 1956, you enrolled at Pine Manor Junior College in  Wellesley, Massachusetts. Can you tell me about that decision? How did  you get from Stillwater to Wellesley, Massachusetts?  Well, my parents had friends in Oklahoma City, primarily, and Tulsa.  Mother kind of thought, I had grown up in Stillwater, and so had she,  and it was a small environment. They just encouraged me to apply. They  thought it would be a safe place for their teenage child to go. (Laughs) I  was always game for anything. I said,    Well, I wouldn   t know  anybody,    and they said,    No, but hopefully you would meet people and  become acquainted.    So, what they really did, when I reflect back, they  pushed me out of the nest. Had I stayed in Stillwater, (there   d been  nothing wrong with that) I never would have as quickly seen Boston,  New York City. I got to go to different Ivy League schools and visit  different people. I mean, there were just all kinds of things that  happened, and I tended to make reasonable grades. It was just one year,  but I then had the obligation to come back to Oklahoma State  University, or I always felt I did because it was very clear I was to  graduate from college, no ands or buts about it. That was expected by  my parents. I usually fell in line. My grandmother had been the second  woman to graduate, and she was still living until 1960, so there was no  question that I was to come back to Stillwater to get my degree.  There wasn   t any thought that being at Pine Manor was perhaps a  stepping stone to go on to Wellesley College or another private school?  No, no. They just thought it would be   I had to say,    Yes, I wanted to  do it.    I was never forced to do anything like that. I was probably a little  hard to manage at times. I don   t know. Teenage girls can be   I   ve never  had any girls. I   ve got a granddaughter on the way, which is exciting. I  just went for the one year. I think mainly, their thought was to give me  broader exposure, and it did. There   s no question about it.  So, you came back then the next fall (it would be the fall of    57) and  enrolled at Oklahoma State which changed the name from Oklahoma  A M to Oklahoma State University at that time. What was your major  and did you have a minor?  11  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Well, I was in education because women didn   t think they had as many  options as they do today. I wanted to have a teaching degree, so I was in  English education, so it put me in the School of Education. I took mostly  history and English courses.  Were there some professors or administrators in the university at that  time that had an influence on you that you recall?  Well, I   m trying to think of all their names. I didn   t get as well  acquainted with some of the professors as, perhaps, I should have. To be  honest, different things occurred that had me gallivanting around to  Kansas City, or actually around the world, which I imagine you   re going  to ask me about later. So, being stationary, doing my lessons and being  in class   I was in class with great regularity, and I made good grades.  There was a Dr. Beers who let me write a paper to get credit when I had  to leave for having gotten this opportunity, because my grades were  good. Dr. Beers, I can remember him and that was very, very helpful to  being able to achieve my degree.  Then I think probably the most influential was actually Dr. Oliver S.  Willham. We all remember him. He was the president of the university. I  had gone into his office and was going to be a candidate for an honor  which I did achieve, which took me out of school for a year. Before I  went on that, he went through my record with me. He called me in. He  wanted to be sure that I was grounded for what might befall me. That  was kind of interesting. I don   t know if that goes on today. I hope so; it  probably does. He let me know that I should play to win. That   s  pressure. (Laughter) And if I didn   t, that was okay, too. But,    Play to  win if you   re put in that position,    so I didn   t forget that. And he was  such a gentleman, but again, he was president of the university, so he  had to be a little competitive.  The next thing he said was,    Now, when you   re in all this, you   re going  to be alone a lot of the time, and just remember at all times, first and  foremost, you   re representing yourself, so you   re responsible for  whatever actions and what you say and what you do.    Pretty good  advice when you think of today   s world. You   re responsible for your  own actions. He said,    You   re representing your family, and don   t  forget, you   re representing Oklahoma State University, and we expect a  lot of you.    Pressure again. (Laughter) And I said,    Well, okay.    He  said,    And I know that your grades are okay, and if you need any help in  finishing up this semester ...    He might have known something I didn   t  know. But he was telling me,    Get your act together and behave  yourself.    I never did anything extraordinary that was going to make the  newspapers. That was very good advice. Once in a while you have to  stop and check yourself.  12  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  I know that President Bennett was of course deceased at that time, but  did you know him earlier?  Henry G. Bennett?  Henry G. Bennett. President Bennett.  Yes, I knew Dr. Bennett, and it   s indirect, but one of his extended  relatives was my godmother, one of the Hoke women.  Did you ever get a chance to know Dr. Bennett at all?  I was too young. Not real well but I always knew who he was, with  distinction. I mean, as a kid. When you   re pretty young, you   re not too  wired in to certain things, but, yes, I   d certainly met him.  I want to ask you about your two competitions as queen, but first of all  could you share some of your activities as a student, where you lived,  some of the organizations and activities you were involved in?  I pretty much stuck to the groups in the School of Education and in  English, in terms of those academic kinds of things. Then I was in a  sorority, Pi Beta Phi. I pledged as a sophomore.  Was that a family thing?  Well, yes, a little bit, a little bit. (Laughter) My mother was Pi Phi;  several aunts on the Berry side were Pi Phis. We had quite a few that  were Thetas on a different prong of the family, so yes, I was a legacy.  My mother was Freshman Queen in her day at Oklahoma A M,  Cynthalice Diggs. And then, they don   t have these things anymore, and  it   s not really an organization, but the Redskin stuff. They had  distinguished students; I   m not sure that   s what they   re called.  What is it, a Redskin Congratulate?  Yes, Redskin Congratulate, you got it. I was one of those at one time. So,  I got into different things.  You were a Redskin Beauty in 1958, Redskin Congratulate in 1959, is  that correct?  Somewhere in that range. It was before 1960, which really dates me.  Well, the Redskin Congratulate, there   s just a handful, maybe a half  dozen or so.  13  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Yes.  They were listed each year and held up as what we call today the  Outstanding Graduating Seniors, top ten kind of thing.  It was that idea. I   d say that was the preliminary to that, yes.  Did you perceive that as being quite an honor?  Yes. You know, I just kind of rolled with the punches. (Laughter) Like I  say, I   ve been pretty blessed, but I   ve had expectations made of me, and  I try to achieve whatever the expectations are. Some are a little harder  than others, and I have expectations of myself.  Malinda, what about student hangouts at that time, on campus and off  campus? Where were some of your favorite places to go to be around  other students?  Well, the Student Union existed; it was pretty new then. It was a pretty  nice place and still is, so we would go through the Student Union, and  you   d kind of hang out. In those days, they didn   t have these franchises  for food. Maybe when you were there, too, a buffet of farm women  came in and it was their job. They kind of knew you. That   s sort of  where you ate. Or I ate at home. Because I lived in the Pi Phi house but  at the same time, I don   t know where I ate, whatever that they brought.  Did you spend much time up on the fifth floor, the coffee shop? They had  the little caf   there.  I would get in there whenever I had time.  What were some favorite hangouts off campus?  Well, there was Louie   s Club Forty out now where the Food Pyramid  grocery store is, right in there. (Laughs) There was Aggie Barbecue,  which was on Washington. We didn   t have what   s known as    The Strip     today, that was Washington Street, but there were a few hangouts, but  the Aggie Barbecue. Then there was McCaffrey   s Drugstore. Now, I ate  hamburgers in there all the time, even starting when I went to Eugene  Field Elementary School, which is where Consumer   s  grocery store  is  today. That was Eugene Fields Elementary School, grades one through  six.  Was Swim   s a popular hangout still at that time?  Yes. It just wasn   t as crowded with things, but the Aggie Barbecue, it  14  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  was kind of a drive-in place, and they had good hamburgers. There was  Cliff   s; those were good hamburgers.  Cliff   s became the Ancestor after that?  Yes.  Was the Hideaway just opening up about that time?  The Hideaway was just opening in the early    60s and the late    50s, yes.  Richard Dermer was in high school about the same time I was, the  owner.  In those early years, did you ever go to the Hideaway?  Yes, but that gets kind of fuzzy. It was just beginning. It wasn   t quite the  hangout it is today; pizza wasn   t that well known. He really rode the  crest there with that one. You know, you didn   t have all these pizza  parlors all around, the different franchise names that we know today. He  really did a tremendous job with Hideaway, and he has kept the integrity  of what he has, too. It   s been interesting.  You had two very special student experiences, Malinda. In 1957, you  were selected as American Royal Queen, and in 1959, the National Maid  of Cotton. Can you tell me a little bit about the American Royal  competition? What was that, and what was the competition like?  Well, the American Royal is the largest cattle and horse show in this  segment of the country, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, kind of all this  middle part, but people come from all over the world there. The  American Royal still goes on today. I was in Kansas City recently in the  last ten years, and the American Royal is still there. It is not what it used  to be, a gathering place to learn, and they would have these judging  contests for cattle and horses, and these fabulous animals would be  paraded throughout the arena and all that kind of thing. Well, in addition  to that, for publicity reasons, they ask each   and many universities  participated, and Oklahoma State was one that did because of all of our  agriculture that we have.  Judging teams and such.  Yes, the judging teams. They trained the kids, and they all slept with the  animals and the whole bit. So, they had a contest on each university  campus, probably to promote the American Royal, for the American  Royal Queen. Well, in those days, for a girl, there were just so many  things to do. Today it is just so different, but, anyway, somewhere along  15  Gill  Fischer  Gill  the line I was put up I think by the Pi Phi house. So, this is a thing going  on at the Student Union. Gerald Bradshaw and Dick Heath were older  than I was at the time. Now it   s not such a big spread, but they were  older at the time, and they were in the Stillwater Jaycees. I remember  that group. Several other guys were in it as well; John Green was one of  them. So, I was one of the contestants. Well, I won to represent  Oklahoma State University at the American Royal for our campus.  I was told that I was to be there on a certain day, and you were told what  you were to do. You know, I got the letter out of Kansas City, the  American Royal, all that stuff, so of course my parents said,    Oh, dear.  How are we going to manage this?    We loaded up the car, my  grandmother that I   m named for, my mother, myself and a chaperone.  We had to have a chaperone. The chaperone was Marguerite  Goodpasture-Shelton, Jack Shelton, the famed basketball player   s wife.  So, off we went. Now, maybe we were in two cars, but I was the  contestant, so I about half knew what was going on, but it was left up to  us to get there. We get there, we   re at the hotel   Muehlebach, I think it  was   Muehlebach. That was very nice, fabulous. I had never been in a  big hotel like that. It was a lot of fun.  Well, you   ll have to talk to Marguerite, because I won it. (Laughter)  That was sort of,    Oh, dear, now what?    Marguerite had two little  children at home, hadn   t made plans to stay for ten days. Mother   s just  laughing. So, then, here comes my dad for the coronation. It was very  funny, and my brother, and then he had Eddie Bellatti with him. Eddie  lives in Bartlesville now. The Bellattis used to run the Stillwater  NewsPress. They were younger; I used to babysit those two. Anyway, it  was just one of those experiences. I was Queen of the Cows. (Laughter)  They kind of leveled me out. I had my little brother and Eddie running  around, and they just were having quite a time in that hotel.  Tell me about the pink Thunderbird. Did they drive you around in a pink  Thunderbird?  You had to be in parades because they had a lot of parades. The pink  Oldsmobile might have been when I lived out of state for a long time  when I got married, but they did have some distinguished Stillwater  people that I think I went down Main Street, Stillwater, in the pink  Thunderbird. That was Earlene and John Leonards    car, but when I was  Maid of Cotton, I was given a Ford station wagon. I think we did have a  pink Thunderbird. I   m not remembering real well what kind of car I rode  in the parade, but I can tell you I had to go through that arena in the back  of a convertible every night at the American Royal.  I heard it was a pink Oldsmobile that they drove you around in.  16  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer   Yes, at the American Royal it was an Oldsmobile.  I just forgot it was  pink. I need to look at a picture, but what was worse than that, I came in  second. Usually they had a movie star go around the arena. Now this is a  dirt arena, kicking up dust, and cows and horses and Stetson hats. You  know, it was big time western. I   m in my frou-frou dress of the 1950s  and everything. The celebrity they had chosen was the dog Lassie.  (Laughter) Remember Lassie? Well, I am the American Royal Queen for  1957, so what happened was, kids are in from the farms from all these  different states, and the arena is full and everything. They would start  screaming,    Lassie  Lassie     So, I   m out there in that arena waving, but  nobody is hollering at me. They   re all hollering at Lassie. My father just  thought that was great, to be upstaged by Lassie. That   s just been it. You  may think you   re a big deal, but here comes Lassie. So, anyway, kids  today, there are still the movies. Lassie, you see those old movies, but  that   s the vintage that we   re talking about.  Malinda, that sort of set the stage then for the following year for your  competition for Maid of Cotton. That was a significant honor. Can you  share some about that?  Well, that was in 1959 that I was the 1959 Maid of Cotton, so there was  that little period, you know. Fifty-seven, then, I was in school, and then  Christmastime of    58 is when I went to Memphis, and I was asked by the  Oklahoma Cotton Council if I would let my name stand as the  Oklahoma Candidate to go to the Maid of Cotton contest. The only  young girls that could be candidates had to be born in a cotton-producing  state. I think born, not just lived there. That was the only   requirement . Most states had state contests for getting to go to the next  thing.  But if I understand you right, Malinda, in Oklahoma you didn   t have the  competition. They just asked you      They had the competition, but in my year they jumped that step,  whoever the powers that be are of the Oklahoma Cotton Council. I really  didn   t know. I just got a phone call. They said,    Based on your  performance at the American Royal, we would like for you to consider  being the Oklahoma candidate. If you accept, we are not going to have a  preliminary contest this year.    Well, that was heady stuff. I   m thinking,     What did I do?    you know?  Yes, didn   t you feel pretty special about that?  Well, I can remember Mother was not home. She was in Caracas,  Venezuela, visiting Stillwater friends that were there. My father was  home. I went to him and I said,    I got this phone call.    He listened and  17  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  he said,    I   m not going to tell you what to do. You   re going to do what  you want to do anyway.    That was kind of,    If it   s something you want  to do, we   ll figure it out. We   ll get you to Memphis somehow.    You  know, that   s sort of the attitude, (Laughs) because I was always doing  something. Kids are kids; you don   t know what they   re going to do. So,  I said,    Well, you think Mother will care?       Oh no. She   s in Caracas,  Venezuela, wherever that is. We   ll somehow manage.    I mean, you  know. I said,    Well, okay, I   ll tell them I   ll do it.    He said,    Do you  have anything else better to do, like go to school?    And I said,    Well,  my grades are okay.    He said,    I know. That   s why I   m going to let you  go.    I mean, school came first. That was our job at that time.  So, poor Mother comes back from   we didn   t have emails and phone  calls. You didn   t call Caracas, Venezuela, and talk on the phone, so she  got home and she   s hit with this. We had, I don   t know, three or four  weeks. I don   t know what it was, a little while. They had certain things  you had to do to compete. So, we set up a little sewing room in the   I  had to wear 100 percent cotton. You know, who has everything in cotton  all at the same time for that kind of thing? So, we set up a sewing room  in our dining room, and it was kind of a flurry of activity. A lady came  in, and we made sure I had a dress and made sure that everything fit me.  I   m sure it was a huge burden on my mother, but I was too young and  stupid to realize it. Everything got together, and we loaded up the car  and off we went.   This is  beginning to sound familiar. (Laughs)  We drove everywhere. We didn   t think about going in an airplane. You  just didn   t do that then. So, off we went. Then, of course, the phone calls  came into Stillwater:    We don   t have any idea, but it   s appearing that  she   s a frontrunner.    I can remember the conversations.    It   s appearing,     I don   t know. I had no idea. I said,    How do you know that?       Well,  Daughter, we   re just observing. We don   t know.    So, in swooped  several of the aunts with their little hats. I have pictures to prove it. My  father appears. They   re all sitting there, and it   s the night of the final  contest. I did win it. I was narrowed down to the finalists, and I won it. I  did not come back to Stillwater for a very long time after that. Off I went  to New York City.  Straight from there?  Straight from there. You didn   t pass go. I mean, first thing happened the  next morning, taken into the American Cotton Industry offices in  Memphis. This is how it worked then; they no longer have this contest.  It   s just not the way the world works today. They explained, in this  particular year, it was going to be the first time they went around the  18  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  world. You   ve got to remember, jet airplanes and all that kind of stuff  was very, very different. In addition to that, I toured all of the United  States, parts of Canada, Hawaii. To see all of the United States was  really something else, too. So, I was then taken out of school. That was  at the end; we had semesters. We usually took exams in January, not at  the end. Fortunately, my grades were good. I had preliminarily been  called in by Dr. Willham. He knew I was going to this contest. That   s  the one he told me to play to win, which I guess I did play to win. I don   t  know what I did. Then I was able to take my exams with my chaperone,  who, by the way, I   m going to visit next week in New York City. She   s  still living, and we both laugh. This has been over fifty years ago. I was  able to take my exams with her being the proctor,  to ensure  that I  didn   t cheat or anything. For my history class, I got to write a paper.  Then did you take off the rest of that semester, the second semester?  All second semester, yes.  Your travel, was it over a period of a year?  Pretty much.  Pretty much that next year.  It was a full year job and I went back.  Can you share some of the places internationally that you traveled to?  You talked about the United States and Canada, Hawaii, Bermuda.  Bermuda, Nassau. Those were hard to get to in those days. England,  Greece, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Japan, Australia. Oh, Australia was  kind of interesting. We landed in Darwin. You   ve got to remember what  an eye-opener for somebody from Stillwater, Oklahoma. It was just     You were nineteen or twenty at this time?  Yes. One of the young men that I had met at the American Royal was  from Australia. Now, when I say that, you know, I would go down in my  gown and swoop through all these beautiful animals and kind of talk to  everybody. I had a great time at the American Royal. We reacquainted,  and then subsequently a few years ago since I   ve moved back to  Stillwater, he came through Kansas City and we met there. My husband  and I went, and he was there with his son. Those very long-time  experiences   he pulled out some pictures of me at the American Royal  that were just hysterical. (Laughter) I said,    You mean you had these all  these years?       Yes.    You know, it was a big experience for him to be in  19  Gill  Fischer  Gill  the United States. He studied, and he since bred cattle in Australia for  his career. It   s very interesting, but some of these people are still living  that I traveled with.  These competitions and our conversations suggest that perhaps you are  a fairly competitive person. How did these two competitions influence  your life and your future? These are pretty big deals, and most young  people didn   t have these kinds of experiences in life. Did it impact you in  any way?  Well, our current provost, Marlene Strathe, she was visiting with me.  She   s a terrific gal, and we   ve become friends. She really hopes that  every OSU student has an international experience. When I reflect on it,  I would say that I had an international experience beyond anything you  could expect. You could say,    Sure, it was a beauty queen contest,    but  it really wasn   t. I had to speak. I had to meet people all over the world. I  have a film of it. Some of it   s pretty funny-looking now. I did everything  from ride camels and get fleas to nearly falling when I   m bowing to the  Queen of Siam, which was Thailand. I had experiences that are just   I  don   t even know how to explain it. I was briefed when we traveled  around the world, had an international economist with us who worked  for Cotton Council International. You know, cotton was a big product,  and these things were beginning to be imported and exported all over the  world.  I had the opportunity in Hong Kong to meet (he   s deceased now, I  received notice some years ago) P.Y. Tang. He had fled Shanghai  Communist China and had resettled in Hong Kong and had all of the  cotton there. I stayed in touch with him and was later at   his son lives in  different parts of the world but we were at Harvard Business School at  the same time. So, it   s been kind of a generationally interesting thing.  When my mother later traveled to Hong Kong, Mr. Tang met her and  made sure that she was comfortable. It   s been quite an experience, but  just to have the exposure to go to these places. The president of the  Philippines   I was in the Philippines. So, I had, at a very young age     and I always knew after talking to Dr. Willham before it even started  that I was representing myself, and you do have to hold yourself together  a little bit when you   re going around under guards and all kinds of stuff.  You   ve got to take care of yourself and honor and respect your family  and Oklahoma State University. I made sure that came out of my mouth  every place that I was.    Oh, yes, she   s from Oklahoma. Oklahoma State  University.    It was in all the newspapers. It was a very enriching  experience. I had some scary experiences, but you have to cope with it.  Can you tell us some special experiences or stories that you recall about  your travels abroad?  20  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Well, I mentioned all of those things, from getting fleas and riding a  camel. I can remember in Karachi, Pakistan. I think, at that time, I had  never been exposed to seeing Aboriginal people  in Australia . They   re  just so tall and so stately and so interesting as people. I had never even  thought about what it was like to   of course, it   s not called Bombay  anymore. It   s Mumbai. I had never been, and to suddenly have these  flutes playing and I look out of my window, and there   s three or four  snake charmers down there waving at me with these cobras coming out  of the baskets, just like you see. (Laughter) That kind of catches your  attention. I mean, how many people have been in cages with kangaroos?  I don   t know that that was my best time being photographed. (Laughter)  Kangaroos are ornery little things. I mean, they kind of don   t like you in  their space. They   ll get you. They could beat you up. They really can.  I   ll never get in a cage with a kangaroo. I got out of there real fast. It tore  my cotton dress. They started yelling at me,    Get out of there  Get out of  there     I said,    Well, you put me in here.    I lived through a lot of stuff.  What else were you asking me? The experiences   I hadn   t really  focused on them in a long time. They pop up every now and again in my  brain.  Malinda, we were talking about your tour abroad as Maid of Cotton.  You had like twenty-seven suitcases in your entourage. Can you describe  that? That must have been quite an experience.  Well, we had the old fashioned Amelia Earhart luggage, which of course  today would be considered obsolete and too heavy, but that was the best.  In each suitcase   I didn   t supervise this. I was just told what I had to  wear on a given day, but designers from all over the world, particularly  the countries we were going to, contributed to the clothing that would be  used for that year of the Maid of Cotton.  And some of this stuff when you were in New York, when you went from  Memphis after you won straight to New York, was a lot of that design  and measuring done in New York?  Yes. We stayed at the Saint Moritz Hotel. I don   t think it   s there  anymore, or it   s called something else now. I   m not sure what. So, all of  these various designers had given an outfit, or one would be chosen once  they had picked who the final representative was going to be, which is  the Maid of Cotton. Then we had a dressmaker right in there in the  room. All of that happened in the course of just two or three weeks.  Then in each country I would usually go in somewhere, and they would  have made a certain thing they wanted shown at some event. So, a lot of  those outfits were custom made on me. Some you could wear   there  was a picture of every one of them on me. Those were sent ahead of  time.  21  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  The twenty-seven suitcases and every bit of clothing, each suitcase was  numbered, and we knew what was in every suitcase. When we would  travel, the manager for me, Libby Clark and a secretary, Judith  Davenport Mitchener, Sumner, Mississippi, (just talked to her over the  Cotton Bowl time) they kept track of all that. What shoes went with  what   you know, I was just told what to wear. Then, that suitcase  number that would be in the room with what I was going to wear at that  stop, whether it be Boston or Des Moines, Iowa. That   s how it worked.  When we traveled internationally, they changed out. They had American  cotton, but many of the outfits were cotton outfits or things made with  cotton of that country. So, I would be dressed on the airplane, depending  on what the weather conditions were and everything to get off the plane.  When we arrived in Karachi, Pakistan, I   m in quite an outfit with  mirrors and   a fabulous outfit. I think I   ve still got it.  Did you have charter aircraft or were you flying commercial?  No, we flew BOAC, British Overseas Airways  Corporation , primarily  in the international flight. But, no, we didn   t have any charter planes or  anything in those countries. We pretty much traveled by car, and we  didn   t explore the whole country. We just pretty much stayed in the  cities or in the environs.  We were talking a little bit earlier about the purpose of this. This was  more than just being Maid of Cotton, traveling all across the world.  What was the purpose of the Cotton Council? Were they promoting  cotton internationally? Was that the purpose of the tour?  Well, really, the whole tour in the United States and other   primarily  the entourage, which had an international economist, very focused on  the commodity, cotton. Don   t forget, commodities are a big thing  worldwide and are today, even more. Look at what   s going on with oil  and gas. (Laughs) We had a photographer that traveled with us  internationally and then the chaperone. There were four of us traveling  together at all times. It was the international economist that was the first  person, really, out of the airplane. We flew commercial the whole time.  So, a lot of your trips and events, when you were there in a country,  were about promoting cotton. It was about exposing the industry.  Yes, and it was sponsored by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,  Cotton Council International and the American Cotton Industry. When  we got into a given country, if they had an organization in cotton, those  people were drawn into it. So, it was actually, when you think about it, I  won   t say it was the beginning, but it was in the earlier stages of  international exchange of commodities. Really, information flow and  22  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  travel capability and transport capability   when you think how it was  fifty years ago as compared today, it   s pretty different. This was in the  early stages of looking at international trade. Cotton is grown in a great  many countries.  Then you returned to Oklahoma State University. Was it the spring  semester of 1960, or did you return that fall in    59?  I think I came in in the fall of    59. I got back in the summer from the  international trip.  Did you graduate from Oklahoma State in spring of 1960?  Yes. I did have to go to summer school. I did that just to wrap up some  credit hours. I was lucky; I had enough units to graduate, actually on  schedule. So, in a sense, I went through college in three years, I mean, if  you put it all together, but I was able to take an exam off-site. I will say  the university helped to accommodate kind of an abnormal situation. I  was a reasonably decent student of whatever I was taking at the time. I  was not flunking out or anything. They helped me along, which was  appreciated.  Could we look at those first few years after you graduated from  Oklahoma State University? Where did you go after you graduated?  Well, I got married. (Laughs) I was whisked off to the Northeast and my  husband, Dick Fischer   and I   m still married. We   re going to be  celebrating our fiftieth anniversary this year, 2010. He was from  Buffalo, New York. He had gone to Harvard undergraduate, and he was  going to go to Harvard Law School. So, we were married at the time he  was at Harvard Law School.  Where did you and Dick meet?  We met, actually, when he was a sophomore at Harvard, when he was  playing hockey for the Harvard Hockey Varsity team and I was at Pine  Manor Junior College. That   s really when we met.  Okay, so when you were at Pine Manor, that year that you spent in  Massachusetts      I knew Dick for about five years before we got married, four or five  years, but, you know, at a big distance.  How soon after you graduated did you and Dick get married?  23  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  We got married in June of 1960, so just when we   June of 1960, and  then I graduated that summer. He came here and worked out in the oil  patch for my dad, decided it would be better to go to law school.  (Laughter)  So, then you all went back to      Cambridge, Massachusetts, is where we lived the three years that he was  in law school.  Is that when you did your Harvard grad classes?  Yes, I was a married student then. I got accepted at Radcliffe for the  Harvard-Radcliffe Program. That   s before they admitted women to  Harvard in Business Administration. That was a really good experience.  We ended up in Rochester, New York, and we lived there for thirty-two  years. All of Dick   s legal career was there.  Can you share some information about your business and professional  activities in Rochester? You had your graduate degree from Harvard-  Radcliffe   s Program in Business Administration. You moved to  Rochester and were there until 1995, so you spent many years there.  Can you share a little about your activities and what you did there?  Well, I had two sons, which we all have that early adulthood period. I  had two sons. I was fortunate to be invited to participate in various civic  things. I got acquainted. I was president of several   I   m talking over a  stretch of time. I was very blessed in being invited to serve on, really,  more than my share of board of directors. I always tried to participate. I  usually was in some leadership capacity. I don   t mean it to sound the  way that it came out, but I was. I mean, from my resume, at one time I  served on probably too many boards to be effective, but I balanced a lot.  When the boys were sort of out of the nest, or at least mature, I did a lot  of consulting in organizational management and development. This was  for for-profits and not-for-profits. I did that for probably twenty years.  My office was in my house. If I were consulting with a given  organization or institution, I   d make sure I had a desk and a telephone  (we didn   t have cell phones) and access to a little help if I needed some  clerical support. I didn   t often need that, but sometimes I did.  Who were some of your clients that you had when you were consulting?  I had six clients at the time that I came to Stillwater and I had to leave. I  felt badly about that. The George Eastman House, that was one. The Al  Sigl Center was another. They service over 30,000 developmentally  disabled. That was a non-profit. There were a couple I couldn   t do when  24  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  I was leaving. A lot of group homes. I worked for the YMCA for several  years. Many times, I   d be asked to do something, and then it would  extend, so usually when I did the consulting, I was with them for several  years, depending on what the needs were.  You were the first woman to serve on the Chase Manhattan Bank   board  in Rochester. Is that right?  Yes. What happened was I was invited to serve on the Lincoln First  Bank board of directors. I did that, and that was a great experience. I was  the first woman. Now, am I proud of that? Not necessarily, except I  lived the women   s movement. I have been battled. I had to go on  television when I was, say, president of the Junior League of Rochester,  with the then National Association of Women battling for the rights of  women, which I felt I was very much a part of just by what I tried to do  with my life but maybe not in the same way. We all may think the same,  but we don   t always go about things in the same way. I was told I was  being exploited because I was a volunteer. That really jerked my chain,  so I just whammed back and said,    Well, I don   t think so. You   re only  exploited if you let yourself be.    Well, that kind of ended the  conversation.  I was very much in favor of many of the advancements for women. Led  the charge with the Junior League, led the charge in other places, and  ended up the first woman on more than one board. The bank board was  kind of a big thing at the time, and I didn   t really realize it, but it was a  very exciting thing. I   m not real proud there weren   t other women, but  there are now women. But Lincoln First Bank was acquired by Chase of  New York, and then it became Chase Lincoln, and later they dropped the  Lincoln and it was Chase. But it was a Rochester bank that I originally  went on, and then it went in with Chase, and that was of the Rochester  division of Chase later. I was on the board with the presidents of the  major companies of the time, Sybron, Bausch and Lomb, Eastman  Kodak, R.T. French. It goes on and on.  Seems to be a pretty heady company.  Well, it was very exciting and a lot of fun. I learned so much and still  have some friends. There are two or three gentleman that I, to this day,  feel blessed that I was taken under their tutelage. I never felt shy. If I  didn   t understand something, I would just call them and say,    What are  they talking about?    And they would say,    Well, where have you been?     (Laughter) I said,    I don   t know. I   ve been changing diapers or  something.    (Laughs) So, they were great teachers, great, great teachers.  Surely you   ve got some good stories you can tell about being the only  25  Fischer  female on the board there for a few years, perhaps some awkward  moments, more for the guys probably than you. Have you got some  stories you remember and can share from that experience?  Yes. I mean, we haven   t rehearsed this. I   ll give you two. One of them  was when I was invited to serve on the bank board, and I can remember  clearly why I accepted. Now, that may be surprising. A gentleman  named Lou Langie   and he   s still living. He   s a great guy, tremendous,  rough-and-tumble. He was president of the bank at the time. He called  me up, and he says,    Malinda, I want to come to your house and talk to  you about something.    And I didn   t really know him very well. I said,     Well, Mr. Langie, I   m going to be downtown. I can come to your  office.    I thought,    Why does he want to come to my house?    I didn   t  know him that well.    Oh, no, I want to come out and see you.    And I  said,    Well, I   m going to be downtown. When are you in your office?     He said,    Any time you say.    So, I thought,    That   s unusual.    Usually  you have to go through layers, but he was a pretty accessible guy. So,  the next week he said,    Why don   t you come in on such-and-such day?     A few days went by, or a week, I don   t know, not very long. I went into  his office. I had no idea why I was there. I sat down; I remember sitting  down in this chair. It was a very masculine chair, and I   m trying to be a  lady. I   m going to tell you something. I had on a skirt, and that thing was  so plush that my legs go flying up because it was too big for me, too big  a chair. Well, I finally got myself positioned so I could sit up straight  and keep my ankles crossed and all those things that I learned from  Monty Martin, probably. So, he said,    Malinda, I   m just going to tell  you straight out. We   re interested in having you serve on our board.    I  said,    Excuse me?    I was just totally unprepared. He said,    We would  like for you to serve on the board.    I said,    Well, what does that mean?     He said,    Well, it means that you   d be the first woman in our (at that  time) 128-year history to be on the board.    And I just looked at him. I  was really stunned. I was stunned. I didn   t know what to say. I didn   t  internalize very long. I never do. That   s probably my strength but also a  big weakness. (Laughter) I looked at him, and I said,    What do you  expect of me?    Because I knew if I got a bunch of bologna from all this  women   s movement going on   see, we   re talking 1970s,    80s, right in  the late    70s into the    80s. He looked at me, and he said,    Nothing more  than I expect from any of the other gentleman on the board. The same  as, nothing more.    I said,    You got yourself a deal.     Now had he said   but Lou was a smart one. Had he said,    Well, we  want you to represent the women, and we want you to        you know, all  that bologna. Not where the women really wanted to go, but at the time  wasn   t   he didn   t do that. He expected the same thing of me. So, I said,     You got yourself a deal.    He said,    You got any more questions?    I  26  said,    I   m sure I do, but I   m so stunned and I appreciate your confidence  in me. I have to just think about this for a while. When   s the first  meeting?       Oh, we meet on the twenty-        and he told me. Well,  women had never been on the twenty-sixth floor of this building. So, the  day comes around of my first meeting. Well, I   m pretty nervous. I will  admit, I am pretty nervous. I don   t know if you want to hear the whole  story, but it really is history of America. Lou could not be at the first  meeting. He was taken out of town to New York or something, but that  was okay, because he had all of his people and everything. I knew Lou  wasn   t going to be there, and I   m thinking,    Boy, how am I going to  handle this?    But he was coming in late. He just couldn   t go in with me.  He was going to be there at the latter half of the meeting.  So, I get on the elevator, and they have this gentleman who was very,  very Italian. Rochester had a very large first-generation Italian  population. They had a very large German population. They had very  large various ethnic groups, Polish and everything. I can remember,  terrific guy, and we get on the elevator, the two of us. Always their new  members are escorted the first time to the meeting; that was just their  custom. It wasn   t because I was female. It   s just the way they do it  because you   ve got to find your way, know which elevator to get on and  all this stuff. So, we   re going up the elevator, and I   m just kind of  standing there, and he looked at me and said,    Are you nervous?    I said,     Yes. I am.    He said,    Don   t worry about it. I   m the first Italian that  ever touched the twenty-sixth floor.    He says,    You   ll manage.     (Laughter) We were friends forever. It just hit me. I never thought that  way about an Italian. I just never had. I thought,    Oh, things are  changing in America.     But where it really changed, I get up on the twenty-sixth floor and they  always serve lunch up there. You had the board room, and they serve  lunch. There were all of these different women standing around in their  aprons. They wore the little white aprons, and they were the waitresses  for the lunch that would follow with this board. I said hello to them, and  my Italian friend started laughing. He said,    Boy, they   re excited to have  you up here.    I said,    Oh.    And so it was time for the meeting, and I   m  getting ready to walk in, and they cheered, put their hands up like this  and they said,    Go for it     (Laughter) And I thought,    Oh, my.    Then it  hit me what I was doing. I hadn   t really   you know, I   m still pretty  young, and I just kind of caught my breath. I thought,    Oh, they are  depending on me. I   ve got to do my lesson.    I had been taught my whole  life  that  you   ve got to do your lesson. So, I walked in the door; the  door was closed. When I came out they were all there, and I looked at  them and I said,    It went okay.    They said,    You   ll be served first, Mrs.  Fischer.    (Laughter) And I said,    Just call me Malinda.    It was a big  day. That was one story.  27  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  The second story was Dr. Chapman. Dr. A. K. Chapman was the  emeritus and well-known president of Eastman Kodak. I could tell you  things he did in World War II with his chemistry and all, but anyway.  He was a very interesting, dynamic, flamboyant person, brilliant. He had  his place he always sat at every board meeting. We   re at lunch, (before  he was unable to come) and he   s sitting across from me, and the  president of the bank, Mr. Langie, was sitting to my right. Dr. Chapman  looks at me, and he says, (he talked with a funny voice)    I don   t know  why you   re on this board. We   ve gotten along just fine without women.  I don   t know why   Louie, why is she on this board? Tell me, Mrs.  Fischer, what are you going to do for us?    (Laughter)  We   re talking about a challenge.  And I think Lou Langie was holding his breath. He didn   t know what I  would say. I just looked at him, and I said,    Dr. Chapman, I   m going to  try to do as well as you have done, and if I achieve that, maybe it will be  a success.    Lou just relaxed. I just know he was thinking,    Oh, thank  goodness she didn   t just hit him over the head.    (Laughter) And Dr.  Chapman looked at me, and he says,    My dear, that   s a pretty good  answer. Maybe I could live with it.    And then a few more meetings went  by, and he patted me on the shoulder. The women all hated the pats, but  I didn   t care. He patted me on the shoulder. He said,    I think you   re  doing okay.    That was the supreme compliment.  So, you did have to take it. I never got too excited about it. Back to what  I was saying earlier about that television interview with the woman with  NOW  National Organization for Women , I never felt like I was being  exploited. At the same time, I tried to do my lesson and to deliver where  I was expected to deliver. It was not easy, and you spend a lot of lonely  time trying to figure things out. But anyway, it   s been a fun ride, and  I   ve had a good time.  One other experience I wanted to ask you about is, I think you served as  Development Director for the Eastman Dental Center for two or three  years. Can you tell me a little bit about that?  Well, they hadn   t had a Director of Development, and they wanted to  raise some money. I was asked if I would do that on any timeframe, and  I had agreed to do it. I found consulting worked better for me than taking  the position. I liked being a consultant better because it gave me much  more flexibility, so I did that for two or three years. My mother was not  well at the time so it got kind of complicated. Several people I knew  were on that board, and that was a very good experience. That group has  now merged with University of Rochester.  28  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Then you and Richard returned back to Stillwater in 1995.  Yes.  What brought that about?  Well, the company   Thomas N. Berry   Company, and The Marietta  Royalty Company. I had two uncles that were still living at the time, Bill  Berry and Jack Berry. They kind of gave me the pressure. They felt   I  won   t say that they were aging out, but I   m aging out now. You kind of  take your turn. We   ve been very lucky that this company was  incorporated in 1937, and I got calls from various ages of shareholders.  It   s a very closely family-held company. Every company has its  personalities. When my father passed away, I came as a shareholder.  What year was that, Malinda, when he died?  He died in 1977. I think everything was transferred right around that  time,    77-   80, right in there. He died in    77, so I started coming regularly  to the annual meetings. I wasn   t on the board of directors. I didn   t live in  town, and my brother was on the board here, which represented our  family, and that was fine. But I did do a project for the company, at a  distance. I was calling all over the country to these different  shareholders. So, it was just sort of a generational, transitional time.  Now all of the original siblings are gone. They   re deceased, and it   s a  different makeup. It   s all cousins. (Laughs)  Did you come back with that in mind or with the understanding that  you   d be president and CEO of the company?  I came to the annual meeting, and I had agreed that, if elected, I would  do it. At that time, we hadn   t formulated that we would move to  Stillwater. I maybe could have done it from Rochester. It was my  husband who encouraged us to move here. We were going to give it five  years; we   ve now been here fourteen. (Laughs) We were going to give it  five years, and we weren   t sure   really what I had to do with the  company was kind of reposition it for the future. I   m not saying we   re  there, but we   re still here which is, thank goodness. You know, the oil  and gas industry takes a lot of ups and downs and got all computerized  thanks to the great help of our accountant who   s now been with us  almost fourteen years, since I came. So, it   s been a labor of love on my  part.  Let me press you just a little bit. Can you talk about the company, your  responsibilities and some of the challenges and opportunities? I   m sure  that this is a time of transition in the energy business. Your leadership  29  Fischer  was a transition. I   ve got to guess that while it   s a good news/bad news  story with all the family and cousins, is it sometimes kind of tough to  keep all the interests together? Can you speak about your transition into  leadership and the transition in the company?  I   ve never had too hard of a time. That   s kind of a hard question. I didn   t  come back with very many expectations. I just sort of had my inner  rules, and I   m not sure what those are. I knew that communication had to  be key when you   re dealing with shareholders that have varying degrees  of interest, varying degrees of knowledge about the industry of which  the company is in. I had adequate knowledge, not super knowledge but  adequate, because of my business school experience, because of my  travel experiences, because of my volunteer leadership experiences,  bank experiences. I was very blessed. This was so lonely the first five  years because I lost all of my friends, all of my contacts, all of my years  of experience in one community with Dick being one of the managing  partners of the law firm. It was a whole different life. So, the first five  years that we were here, I can   t say they were easy years for me because  I had so much to do right here, and you don   t talk about what you   re  doing because it   s nobody   s business, and I still don   t. Like, I have  people today say,    Do you really go in every day?    Well,    Yes I do,     doesn   t mean that I have to do a whole lot every day, because I don   t,  I   m the first to admit, as chairman. But I do, just because I do everything  out of the office. I   m talking to you in my office, I do all my civic work,  whatever.  Dealing with a family company, I had very good advice from Mr.  Sperandeo who   now you see PetSmart, that franchise? Well, his family  in the Rochester area   and I was consulting a board. He ran a family  company. When I knew that I was going to be doing a family company,  I went to him and I said,    I   m being asked to run a family company. It   s  not with the pet business,    and I knew he was going to sell out. I said,     What do you do? How do you start?    He started laughing. He said,     Well, you better get a survival kit.    (Laughter) Anyway, so we had a  nice visit. Then he pulled out, and I can show you the whole set. I have a  full set since I   ve come here. It   s called the Family Business Journal.  It   s a little newspaper thing put out every month, (it now comes out on  computer) and it   s just about family businesses all over the world, real  simple to read, real easy. So, he said,    Just take it. It   ll cost you a  hundred dollars a year, but just take it and read it.    I said,    Well, that   s a  good idea.     Now, I had a book or two; we were always passing books around about  family businesses. We now send it to our whole board. What this little  journal does, it tells you of different problems, issues, good things, bad  things that family companies deal with all over the world, so when you  30  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  get into a little nit within your board, (and if my brain clicks in, and it  clicks in less and less these days) that,    Oh, that   s not just our problem;  it   s not a new problem or issue,    it doesn   t always have to be a problem.  I   ll show it to you before you leave. I go take a look, see if anything on  that issue is in there, and family businesses have issues that aren   t  always business. It   s very helpful, because then I can come back and  say,    By the way, in the Family Business Journal, did you know that so-and-  so in Spokane, Washington, is having the same problem or same  issue? Here   s what they did. Here   s some ideas.    It gives you great  thinking points. So, I think with family business, the one thing I   ve  learned is there will always be things arise. They   ll always be different,  depending on which people are talking about it. Somewhere there is an  answer, and you neutralize the emotion if you can go and read this  Family Business Journal. So, for that I am forever grateful that it was  called to my attention by a friend in Rochester before I left to take that,  and it   s come in real handy. I won   t say it   s the answer, but I will say  that it helped me a lot.  You talked about leaving your friendships and lifelong connections, I  guess, for thirty-plus years in Rochester. Can you talk about your  engagement or your reengagement, if you will, in the Stillwater  community, your return to your roots and your hometown and your  home university? What was that like for you?  I never thought      You said    lonely    at one time.  Well, you know, who wrote it, Virginia Wolf:    You cannot go home  again.    Well, some of them are deceased, varying degrees of senility,  you know what I mean. It   s life. I had no expectations. I had people say  to me,    Why are you here?    Like I had been a big failure. I would just  say,    Well, I   m working out at the company.    It was because I felt an  obligation. You grow up in a company like this, where your dad was  involved with it. For some reason, I was asked. I don   t have any real  reasons, but I   ve always felt there   s a certain obligation you owe to your  past. Some people don   t have that same feeling. I think that also my  husband was ready to make a change. You know, he   s a tax lawyer. He  was really quite successful, and we could afford to move here with  everything that had gone on in our lives for the past thirty-plus years,  and we were lucky people. He has always liked Stillwater. He loves to  play golf. He taught here for six years at the School of Business as an  adjunct professor, not a full professor or anything. He   s part of the  Oklahoma Bar, if he ever thought he   d do anything. He kind of likes not  being the whipping boy with tax law. We   ve really enjoyed being here.  31  Gill  Fischer  As far as reconnecting, sure you reconnect with friends that you haven   t  been around in a long time. I always came back to high school reunions  when I could. I   ve made a lot of new friends since we   ve been here, and  after I   d been around about five years, I got involved with helping out a  little bit with OSU and have done several things there which have been  nice opportunities, complex, but nice. I   ve met a lot of people through  that that I wouldn   t have, so I   ve had an enjoyable experience. I   ve been  invited to serve on a couple boards here locally, but also out of  Oklahoma City. They   re statewide agencies, and that   s been nice.  Heritage Trust Company, I am on that board, and that was an interesting  linkage. Nancy Payne-Ellis was actually chairman of the OSU  Foundation Board of which her father-in-law, Mr. Payne, had started in  the early, about 1960-61, I think is the history of it. I was on the board of  governors or something, and she came up to me and she said,    You  know, we do know each other, you do remember.    It had really been a  long time, so we pieced   my dad had done work with Mr. Payne. He  was Big Chief Drilling. So, anyway, we reconnected through OSU.  Also, she had been in the same sorority. I   m a little older than Nancy,  but the same vintage. So, one thing led to another, then my resume and  everything, and I was then invited (it   s been almost ten years now) to  serve on their board, and I   ve continued to have a nice experience. Now   Stephen  Bond Payne, her son, is giving some time to OSU Foundation.  You moved into some leadership roles with the Foundation.  Additionally, on the board you were chairman, which is the chief  volunteer position for the Foundation. Then you were interim for about  a year, I guess, interim president and CEO, when they made a transition  from Ron to the next CEO. Do you remember what some of the  challenges and opportunities were at that time when you were moving  into a leadership role at the Foundation?  Well, I was serving on the board of directors of the OSU Foundation,  and I was like vice chair. The chairman was Ross McKnight at the time.  He and Kirk Jewell called me and asked if I   d come in to see them, and I  did, and they asked if I would serve as president and CEO. I said,     Interim, because how am I going to handle my company?    It was kind  of a hard time, (Laughs) but in the meantime I had become chairman of  this company, and a cousin was president, you know, so you   ve got to  work on these transitions. So, I agreed to do it for an interim period, not  knowing how long that interim would be. I fortunately had a little  experience being on the board. I was familiar with some of the  employees at that moment in time, not all, of course. I had some  knowledge, but I really was relying to pull me through it on my  consulting experience. So, I felt,    Well, this is where they needed to be  helped out a little bit, for now,    so I accepted to do it, and it was about a  32  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  year. When it was time for the natural change of officers is when I felt     then I rolled in and became chairman of the board. I only took that for a  year because I felt like maybe I had been around long enough. I didn   t  want Monty waiting, and, anyway, it all worked out. Here we are. Now  we   ve got Barry Pollard as the chairman.  You had wonderful experiences, the chief volunteer officer and the chief  paid officer for the Foundation.  Kind of unusual.  And that close together, very unique. Looking at your experience in  those two positions but also your time on the board of trustees, you look  back on some highlights and special experiences. I think, during that  time was the Bring Your Dreams to Life campaign.  It had just ended. I wasn   t a part of that campaign. It had ended, and they  were very successful with it. And may we be as successful with the next  campaign.  I understand it   s going to be announced here pretty soon, maybe as  much as a billion dollar campaign. How do you feel about that  campaign coming up?  Well, I   m not really wired in on all of the management of it. Let   s hope  it   s successful, because I think we don   t have any choice. If we   re going  to keep advancing, the good things that OSU does   I think with all of  the building going on on our campus, we got a half billion dollars of just  new buildings.  About  700 million, I think, current and online, coming online.  It   s close to a billion. Of course, Washington throws around the word     billion    so much, but to me, that   s a lot of money. A billion dollars is a  lot of money.  What   s the expression?    Failure is not an option.        Failure is not an option.    (Laughter) That   s Susan B. Anthony. She, by  the way, was in Rochester. The Susan B. Anthony House is there. I did a  little consulting for them.  When you recall your years on the board of trustees and your officer  positions, what are some of the significant achievements,  accomplishments, goals of that era?  33  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  At the OSU Foundation?  At the OSU Foundation when you were part of the trustees and in an  officer role.  Well, that was 2004. I mean, that was      But you were on the board for about eight or nine years, were you not,  during that period?  Yes. Well, I would say that the need for private dollars to a state  university has   quadruple is probably the wrong number, but really,  Jerry, it used to be you didn   t need private funding at Oklahoma A M  because it was a state institution. It was a land-grant university. They  would bring in money (you know better than I) for grants for various  research in veterinary medicine or agriculture and all that with the  USDA  United States Department of Agriculture , but state dollars came  in. Now it   s my understanding that state dollars are about 30 percent. So,  hopefully during the tenure there has a been a lot of effort done to  reposition OSU so that it   s in a position to do fundraising, both private  dollars but also the grants, like from NIH  National Institute of Health   or all of those things, to have the skills to deliver the background and the  paperwork that   s necessary for that kind of thing, because that   s very  important for the viability of it.  Also, there seems to be an increased need for scholarship money for  students, to recruit the best and the brightest as best you can, from all  over the world, for that matter. I think that the awareness of what was  going on to recruit these students where our university   you know,  really Oklahoma State, in terms of private fundraising compared to other  schools, hasn   t done it that long. Now, yes, we   ve been doing it always.  People give to their alma mater, but not to the degree that it   s done  today. A lot of that is good old-fashioned awareness, public relations, so  that people have their desires of what they want to perpetuate, but also  there   s various needs and shall be continuing new needs of the university  in research and whatever it is. So, hopefully, during the time that I  served on the board, we came up with ways to remain nimble and make  it possible that the Foundation and the university together   I   m not  isolating. I don   t think one entity is responsible for all fundraising. I  think it takes the deans. I think it takes students. I think it takes  awareness. I think it takes your president as your lead. I think it takes  everybody that   s working with that institution at that time. It   s hard to  manage, really.  Part of your contributions and your trustees, I think I hear you saying, at  that time was perhaps structuring and organizing internally to help  34  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  support the fundraising components.  Yes, another thing that I think is always my hope   and, you know, I  don   t want to say   because you never do any of these things alone at an  institution like the Foundation or an alumni center. It takes the whole  group. But to me the philosophy should always be where you have these  various cubicles in a larger entity that is really there to serve the  university that it   s representing. You have a lot of development officers.  They tend to be younger, sometimes new to all of this. I try to always  say,    Be sure to do your lesson. Know about the people that you   re  talking with and, just as importantly, understand the topic that they   re  talking about. If you don   t know, you should say you don   t know.    Back  to what way I grew up, go do your lesson. Get the help you need to be     you don   t have to be sophisticated, but you better know what you don   t  know. You really have to honor what   s going on.  That   ll never be always done to perfection for every single person. We  know that. I still yap at them about different things. (Laughter) At the  same time, I think communication and also the different areas within the  Foundation that have various responsibilities   you know, everything  from record keeping to talking to the prospective donors to this. To me,  everybody has to kind of know what everybody else does so they  understand the total of what   s going on. I just, hopefully, got in place  that that   s something that always needs to be worked on. It   s not just  done and that   s the end of it. You have to constantly be training and  bringing in new people, and some of your best people leave for whatever  reason, and I don   t think that   s going to change with something like a  foundation or an alumni association. So, you have to be pretty open and  pretty nimble and welcome new ideas. But you know, an idea   s only as  good as its implementation, so sometimes ideas just aren   t so good if  you can   t get them done. (Laughs)  Dick Poole, former Vice President of University Relations and  Development and Business Dean says,    Oh, hell, anybody could have a  good idea. Execution is what it   s all about.    (Laughs)  Right. Sometimes, at a place like the Foundation, there   s just too many  ideas, but the important thing is you know what they are, you keep  working on them in bits and pieces in a timely fashion. I would get  frustrated with the lack of timeliness from time to time, but that   s  nothing new. That   s probably best; then you make a better decision.  Malinda, how do you feel about the leadership of Burns and Ann  Hargis? How do you feel about them as a leadership team at Oklahoma  State?  35  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Well, I think they   re pretty sparky. First of all, I think they have a real  good time doing it. I think that they care about OSU a lot. More  importantly, they care about the community in which Oklahoma State  sits. I say that   as recent as yesterday, Ann Hargis was sitting right in  the seat right here, where you are. She had stopped in. We had a group,  because you know Stillwater is working towards expanding already the  success of its museum without walls, i.e. the Stillwater Children   s  Museum, better known as the Oklahoma Wondertorium. Ann is on that  board. She cares that it happens and becomes a success because, after  all, it   s just the synergy that goes on by having things for children in the  recruitment of new professors or whatever, for Oklahoma State. They  care that their children have things to do and see and be part of in a  community in which they live. So, all of this stuff feeds on itself. The  fact is, when you are a citizen of Stillwater, Oklahoma State University  definitely has a presence. (Laughs) I think that they care a lot and do  what they can. They don   t have a schedule. Their schedule is whatever it  is of the moment and the priority. I find that they   re both quite  accessible. I wouldn   t put in an unnecessary phone call or email to them,  but I can tell you when I do I get a response. And I   m not alone with  that. People are talking about it. I think they work their tails off for  Oklahoma State. I think that they care about it academically and  personally in all aspects. I hope everyone allows them to get acquainted.  It   s hard to move into a town like this.  How do you feel about the future of Oklahoma State University right  now?  I feel pretty positive. I think it   s   with Ross McKnight and Billie  McKnight leading the campaign, they   ll give it their best shot. They care  a lot about it. I should think the future is bright. More and more people  are needing education. I think we should stick to what we do best, like  the veterinary school. I think the agricultural component   we have to be  able to grow our own food and know what things do. I think our future is  quite bright. You certainly have some loyal alums, and you   ve nurtured  that along the way, and that   s important.  It   s part of the total picture.  Absolutely.  Changing the subject a little bit back to your family and your perception,  does your family heritage form a part of your passion for giving back to  Stillwater and OSU? Is it part of your spirit for giving back?  Oh, sure. I mean, OSU and Stillwater   I   ve always considered myself  from Stillwater, Oklahoma. I used to say North Central Oklahoma when  36  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  I lived in the Northeast.  They had no idea where Stillwater is.  Stillwater used to be really centrally isolated. It still is today, but I   ve got  to say I-35 and I-51, and all of those do make a big difference. It used to  just be  Highway  33 to get to Oklahoma City. I   m pretty loyal, but it  just dates back so many generations that I don   t know any different.  That   s kind of where I was going with that. It   s sort of ingrained,  because your family has given, and I   m not talking about just  necessarily financially, but, of their time, their talents and leadership  over three and four generations now.  Right.  Do you sense and feel a part of that legacy and that history of being  engaged and involved in giving back?  Yes, probably. It   s a sense of responsibility. You know, some family  members do it more than others depending on where they live in the  state or what their opportunities are or their interests. Again, I   ve been  blessed with, perhaps, more than my share of opportunities, but  hopefully I   ve met the responsibilities as much as I could. I   m still  going. (Laughs)  Well, you   re a business executive. You manage two companies, you have  a degree in business, yet you   re passionate about the arts and history.  Why? Where does this come from?  Well, I think business is wonderful and has a lot of history and a lot of  legacy, but I do think that the history of the world and of people you do  find through art, through music, through museums. It   s the collective  memory of the world. If you can capture it in the area in which you live,  then hopefully you   re helping to preserve a little something. I commend  you on what you   re trying to do for Oklahoma State and the families that  have been a part or have touched one another.  Can you share about some of your activities in the arts and humanities,  and museum work that you have done here in the Stillwater area and  statewide?  I   ll try to. If I don   t have something in front of me, sometimes I forget.  I   m creeping up on age here. I was chairman of the Sheerar Museum,  which I enjoyed, earlier, in early 2000. I served on the Oklahoma Arts  Institute, which offers opportunities to high school children and adults at  37  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Quartz Mountain. I have given a scholarship for teaching, an endowment  which is for teaching excellence in the arts for a tenured professor, the  arts at Oklahoma State. It was named for my mother and grandmother  who both, of course, went to Oklahoma State. That   s given for  excellence in teaching in theater, music, painting or drawing, the arts we  mean in that way, poetry, any form of that type of thing. My husband  and I established the Thomas E. Berry, named for my father,  Professorship in the College of Agriculture. It   s on water resource  management. He had been a long-time promoter and advocate. Although  he was in the oil and gas business, he understood Oklahoma   s needs for  water and all of that kind of thing. He had several experiments that he  did on some of his land with the university. So, when the match came  through, that one has been funded, I am very pleased to tell you. There is  a staff there to do it. That   s one of the professorships that   s up and  running. I appreciate the match that we received from Boone Pickens  and appreciate the match from the State of Oklahoma, so at least mine   s  in place.  Malinda you also, I think, have served on the board of the Oklahoma  Heritage Association. Is that right?  No, Heritage Trust Company but not the Oklahoma Heritage. We   re a  member of that, but I haven   t served on that board. I serve on the  Communities Foundation of Oklahoma and the Oklahoma Medical  Research Foundation. That might be the other Oklahoma one that you   re   thinking of ; their main headquarters are in Oklahoma City.  What are some things about Malinda Berry Fischer that most people  would not know and might perhaps surprise them?  Oh, dear. (Laughs) I don   t know. I can   t really answer that question. I  think that maybe sometimes I appear that I don   t take things too  seriously when really I do. I can be battered pretty fast. I   m pretty  sensitive. My husband knows that. I get kind of overwrought over  nothing, some little nit. I get a little too picky sometimes. Maybe I have  formulated in my head I want something just a certain way and, you  know, about 100 percent of the time it doesn   t turn out that way. I   ve  never gotten over that. I try to do my lesson, like I said. I will admit, I  don   t think people know how much lonely time I do spend. I tend to  kind of say too much sometimes at meetings. I wish I didn   t. It gets me  into trouble sometimes. (Laughs) I do try to do my lesson and  contribute. With me, what you see is what you get. I   ll usually   if you  ask me a question, you   ll get more of an answer than you want.  Malinda, would most people see you as competitive? As one who has  known you fairly well for the last few years, it was interesting to see  38  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  your competition of Maid of Cotton, American Royal Queen, Pioneer  Queen, Redskin Queen, Redskin Congratulate. These are competitive  kinds of things. I suspect that the only reason you probably weren   t a  high school athlete is because they didn   t have girls    athletics when you  were going through Stillwater High School. Is that a fair assessment?  Are you a competitive person?  Probably. I never thought a whole lot about it. As Dr. Willham said,     Play to win.    Well, what else do you have to do in life? If you don   t  win, where are you going to be? Now, I don   t mean winning has to be  the top, but what you want to be is knowledgeable, well-educated,  inspiring to others if you can be, to take new challenges with the fun that  they can be rather than,    Oh, woe is me. I don   t know anything.    One of  the best lessons I learned was from a high school American History  teacher. The exam was coming along, and I was a pretty good student.  I   ve said that before. Never at the top but I was always in the top part.  The exam was handed out, and I didn   t know a single answer, and I went  flying up to his desk and I said,    Mr. Murphy, this is the wrong exam.     He said,    Ms. Berry, you just settle down. This is an open-book exam,  and the answer is in this room. You   re going to learn in life it   s not  always knowing the answer. It   s knowing how to find the answer. You  better get to work or you   re going to fail the test.    Now, today, that  would probably be abusing your student. Boy, did that put me down. I  made a B minus on the test because I wasted all that time twitting, but  I   ve never forgotten what Mr. Murphy said.    You may not always know  the answer, but you better have the sense to learn how to find the  answer.    I think that   s probably something people don   t know about me.  I   ll just kind of dive in. I don   t dive in and swim out. I will dive in and  have just enough knowledge to be dangerous, but I may have to get  more information before I can get out.  You go down twice, but you come up that third time.  Right. I would say that   and that   s lonely time. I   m sure you   ve done it.  I   m sure anybody that has had to be a chair of anything has to spend that  time to be sure that you have a sense of the direction that you want to go  and know the personality of whatever it is you   re trying to manage. I try  to do that.  I sense a couple things that come out in our conversation that revolve  around discipline from your parents:    Do your lesson.    Now this might  be something that wouldn   t surprise people as much, but the depth of  it   is that a fair assessment to say as we talked about your life and when  you were growing up, talking about your parents, what they taught you  and then later in life, you do your lesson, you discipline yourself, you do  the hard work? Is that a fair assessment, that discipline has been a part  39  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  of your success?  Yes. Thank you for saying    success.    I   m reasonably disciplined. My  boys used to   and you learn from your kids. These little faces would  look at me, and they   d say,    Mom, what am I doing today?    I remember  the first time, and I   d say to them,    Well, it's whatever you put together  you   re going to do today.       No, you tell us. What are we doing today?     Well, it dawned on me, I had been telling them,    Now we   re going to get  up, we   re going to have breakfast, the school bus will come, etcetera.     Finally it dawned on me, I have that discipline that every day   like I  woke up this morning, and I   m yapping at my husband,    Now don   t  forget so-and-so is coming at nine o   clock. Jerry Gill   s going to be with  me; I can   t be here. Don   t forget.    All this stuff. He finally said,    I got  it,    and walked out of the room. (Laughter) So, I think I   m a little over-programmed  sometimes. If that   s discipline, I try not to miss a beat with  whatever the game plan is for the day. Tonight, I know I have to be at  the basketball game and in the seat before eight o   clock. I do try to  figure it out.  Can you share some of your favorite OSU memories as a student, later  in life, recently? Can you look back at some events that stand out in your  life, in your relationship with Oklahoma State?  Well, we always had a lot of fun. The students didn   t leave campus on  the weekends like they do today. There was really a lot of stuff going on,  hanging around, talking and   it wasn   t necessarily dates or anything. I  don   t know. We seemed to always have a lot to do. Just in general, I  never felt   of course, I was from Stillwater, so I was always at home  here, but at the same time I can remember I was in the Pi Phi house, and  the Sigma Nu house was next door, and they were getting ready to have  their frontier weekend. Well, we had, at my house, a pet crow named  Crow, of course. It was my brother   s pet. My brother   s five years  younger, about. That crow would follow the cars. It had followed me. I  had been home, and I   d driven back to the Pi Phi house. Well, the guys  are out, and Crow had come down to where they were sitting around the  fire. I   m hearing out the window that they were going to roast Crow. I  know this sounds nuts. I went barreling down,    You   re not going to eat  my brother   s crow     and all of this stuff. Then they start haranguing me.  I was really almost in tears. I ran in the house and I said,    Mother,     (fortunately she was home; there weren   t cell phones in those days)    get  Tom up here. I can   t get Crow to come to me but he can.    She said,     What do you mean Crow   s up at the Sigma Nu house?    I said,    They   re  going to eat him. They   re going to eat him.    She said,    They won   t eat  Crow. They   re smarter than that.    She was doing a play on words, and I  didn   t even get it. (Laughter)  40  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  So, she comes up, probably got picked up by Cycling Sam. She zooms  up in her car. Tom jumps out, and he   s a little scrawny thing. He goes  over to the campfire, and Crow was there and flew over and got on his  shoulders. Well, did that shut those guys up. That was a town university  scene. It was a scene. You know, crows are real smart. Since we   ve been  back, there was a woman doing a study on crows, putting stuff on them.  I don   t know what all happened. It was some research project. That was  really a dumb experience that you didn   t expect to hear about.  Sometimes you just have to protect your animals from the fraternity  boys. (Laughter) And, actually, we always had a good time with  Homecoming. We used to stuff that crepe paper, and it was nothing as  fancy as it is today. I don   t know how they do it.  The floats were much bigger then than the house decorations.  Floats were a lot bigger, and they were crazy. That part was always a lot  of fun. The Walk About wasn   t quite the magnitude it is today. There  just weren   t as many people that came in for it. We always had a good  time. Everybody seemed to know each other. It   s always been a friendly  campus. Yost Lake was always a destination, both as a kid and in  college. Yost is still out there, but it   s a little more of a private family  thing, and it always was. It just seemed a little rowdier than it is now.  Did you ever go to Horsethief Canyon?  Yes.  Have some good times there?  That was a crazy place.  Any details you want to share with us?  No, but you know it is kind of a scary place. When you look on the maps  of the Berry brothers, which we   ll do another time, that was all down in  there, those dugouts. That place is for real. I actually have a painting of  it that Connie Thibeau Catsis did. I   ll show you the picture sometime. I  have a painting at my house of it.  Looking back on your life, what have been your major  accomplishments? Don   t be modest here. What, from your perspective,  do you think have been your major achievements?  I haven   t really analyzed that, Jerry. I guess just holding it together and  being married fifty years. That doesn   t happen too much anymore.  (Laughs) And my boys both have master   s degrees, and they both have  41  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  families. We hear from them, but not a whole lot.  Where are they living, Malinda?  One lives in New Mexico, and the other in South Carolina, so we   re in  close touch, but, like my husband said,    You can   t have it both ways.  They   re either independent or they aren   t.    That   s a success. I feel that  hopefully I   ve met obligations and/or expectations of me when I   ve been  put in different positions. I feel I have a lot of friends. I   m sure there are  people that disagree with my approach to things. You don   t always hear  about those, but I   ve never had any fistfights with anybody. I tend to  respect opinions of others, but I feel that   s because I   ve had a lot of  opportunities to hear a lot of a different viewpoints and religions. It is a  big world out there.  How do you feel about having come back and taken over management of  Thomas N. Berry   Company? We talked about that earlier in the  interview. That surely that was a significant experience for you in your  life.  Well, yes. We left an area that I really loved living in, Rochester, New  York, and the Finger Lakes district is a beautiful, beautiful part of  America, really. It   s very distinct. It   s very agricultural; a lot of people  don   t know that. One of the five most   because all of the glaciers came  through there for the Finger Lakes. We left a lot of friends and  acquaintances. I think any place you raise your kids   our kids were  there from birth through high school. We didn   t move around. You just  have a lot of friends from when you have kids the same age and all that.  So, all of that was left behind when we moved here, but we still have  contacts. In fact, we were just invited last summer, we went to the  Adirondack Mountains, stayed with friends we knew from Rochester  we   d done things with. We   ve kept up with some, and they   ve been here.  They love Oklahoma. I   ve had a lot of good times. I have a few times  that weren   t so easy. I don   t really have any regrets, and I really rarely  look back. If I had lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Rochester,  wanting to be in Stillwater   you know you want to make the best of  wherever you are, whatever happens in life, and you   ve got to live with  your decisions. I think that probably I   ve been reasonably successful  with that.  You talked earlier about your activities at the time when women were  coming into leadership roles in business and nontraditional areas. Was  that important to you in your life? Is that one of the significant things  you look back on and think about?  Well, you are where you are at your place in history. You don   t have a  42  Gill  Fischer  choice when you   re born or anything, and you either are a part of it or  you   re on the fringe. I was never intentionally in the dead center of the  women   s movement, but because of my education, both having a college  degree and the advanced degree at Harvard, I think it did open up  opportunities for me at a place in time that was a bit unusual. I was the  first woman to join the Harvard Business School Club of Rochester. I  was their first female president. I also represented them on the National  Harvard Business School Association Council. Served as secretary of  that. That   s a whole other series of things. Again, that was in the early     70s up until about    77, kind of in that period in the early to mid-   70s. I  would say that by education and just being interested and accepting  those challenges   sometimes they were uncomfortable, but I didn   t  think much about it. I found the women   s movement changed men more  than it did women.    Oh, hello, you   re here.    (Laughter) I have always  just, again, tried to accept the opportunities and do the best I can. I just  tend to do different things, don   t I, when you look at the whole resume.  I   ve had a lot of nice experiences. Hopefully, I   ve fulfilled what was  expected at that moment in time.  Reflecting on your legacy, how do you hope people will remember  Malinda Berry Fischer when they look back?  She did what she said she   s going to do, or what she accepted to do, that  I accomplished what I was there to do at that point in time. You know,  the kiss of death is when you start getting self-congratulatory. (Laughter)  I   ve learned that one; that   s straight out of my father   s mouth. He said,     You   re in big trouble when you get self-congratulatory.    So, thank you  for telling me that I have achieved. I hope to achieve a bit more in my  old age. Just what, I don   t know, even if it   s just being a good grandma.  I talked to my three-and-a-half-year-old grandson, Bretton Berry Fischer  in South Carolina and I said,    What are you doing, Bretton?    He said,     I   m doing.    And I said,    Well what have you been doing today, what  activities?    He says,    You know, I just don   t remember.    (Laughter)  And I thought,    That   s hysterical.    I said,    Well, I   m going to tell you  something, Bretton. You   re going to have to start remembering if we can  talk because I won   t know what you   re doing.       Well, I don   t remember,  today.    I thought,    Well, I   m going to have to teach that child.    So, see,  I have a mission, that he   s going to have to remember. I said,    Did you  eat breakfast?    He said,    Yes.    (Laughter) I said,    Well, did you play  with your truck?       Yes.    I said,    Did you go outside?       Yes.    I said,     Well, those are all things that you   ve done today.    He says,    That   s  right. That   s what I   m doing.    So, I thought,    I have a mission here. I   ve  got to make sure that that little grandson knows what he   s doing every  day.    I was telling Dick this and he said,    No, no. You did it with your  own kids. You had to stop. Don   t start now again.    So, the truth is, Jerry,  I don   t know what I   m going to be doing if I can   t manage somebody  43  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  else.  We   ve just touched on a few things in your life. Are there some things  you   d like to share that would help us understand your life a little better,  that you feel are important? Is there something we haven   t covered?  Well, I think that in all of my travels, I   ve always said that I   m from  Oklahoma, North Central Oklahoma. People kind of look at me   you   d  be surprised at how many people have never been to Oklahoma. You  know, and I had the opportunity to go through Leadership Oklahoma  and went all over the state. Really, that was a great experience for me,  coming back into the state. You go out in Western Oklahoma, (and they  call it the Crossover State) and you look up in the sky and all the  airplanes are crossing over and everything. But I   ve always been proud  of being an Oklahoman and all the history that I   ve been part of.  Oklahoma State has been a big part of it. Hopefully, just as all of us that  are pure Okies hope to   you don   t find too many people that don   t like  living in Stillwater. It   s still a little town, in its own way. It   s a good  place to live, and I think the university makes it that way.  As far as about me, I guess I   ve come back to home base. We   re not  planning to go anywhere or to leave or return to New York State or  anything because this has become home. Dick really likes it here, always  has or we wouldn   t be here. He really likes the golf. Once in a while he  does a little ethics at the university. He   s actually an ethicist, in addition.  There   s ethics to a lot of things in life, whether it be medicine or  engineering or you name it. He looks at that from a legal perspective;  hasn   t done a whole lot of that recently. I think that we   ll just continue to  try to make Stillwater and whatever we   re called upon to do the best that  it can be and participate in whatever ways that we   re asked to do,  providing whether we feel we   re the right ones to attempt it.  Back to your Stillwater and Oklahoma roots.  Yes, so it   s just sort of transitional. I don   t have any big plans for the  future other than I   m going to have a granddaughter, which will break  the locker-room mentality of my household. We have two good  daughter-in-laws, and so that will be fun. Whatever comes my way at  OSU, if I feel appropriate   I   m getting a little more selective on where I  spend my time as I think all of us do. (Laughs) I appreciate it, and I look  forward to hearing about all of your project, because it   s great to at least  get it down.  ------- End of January 20, 2010 interview -------  Getting back to the Berry family, they came into Indian Territory back in  44  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  the 1870s along with your great-grandfather, William E. Berry. What  stories do you remember about them coming into the territory?  Well, the six Berry brothers were old enough, and they were in the Civil  War. Following the Civil War with all the disruption that occurred in  Kentucky, the area of Kentucky that they lived and grew up, they came  west. This is a typical American story. William Edward Berry, who was  my great-grandfather, was the eldest of the six brothers. First he came  into Kansas and then dropped on down to the area of Pawnee,  Oklahoma. He began working at a trading post there, and he kind of  established it, is my understanding, but believe me, it was long before I  was around. Then the other brothers joined him pretty quickly thereafter.  If there were any women and children, they were left behind either in  Kentucky or in Kansas, the state of Kansas near the border. Again, that   s  my understanding from word of mouth, and it makes sense, and it   s  consistent with a lot of Oklahoma history.  They were basically cattlemen, and they ran cattle from Pawnee down to  the Texas line and even into Texas, is my understanding. They also were  big traders. As they worked and earned their living through running  cattle and trading, they also began to look at the banking situation. This  is all before statehood, but statehood came not too long after they   well,  ten, twenty years can be a long time, but it took awhile. They also got  into banking, law and other forms of ways of making a living. I think  you have to be a jack of all trades in a sparsely populated area. That   s  why they came; it was following the Civil War.  Now, I understand that the ranch, eventually   they traded cattle up and  down, but the ranch was started from somewhere around the north side  of the Cimarron River up to Pawnee. They had leased about 60,000  acres. Is that right?  Yes, that   s correct.  William E. Berry was your great-grandfather. He settled on, is it called  Berry Bluff Ranch now?  Yes, we call it Berry Bluffs. The Thomas N. Berry and Company owns  the ranch at the present time, and it   s leased out again for cattle and  grazing, pretty much.  It   s located where Stillwater Creek runs into the Cimarron?  Yes, the confluence of that into the Cimarron River. It   s just a tad north  and a tiny bit west of Ripley, Oklahoma, where quite a few of the  Thomas Nelson children were born and schooled, at least through eighth  45  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  grade.  Then when the Run of    89 came, of course, then they had to give up all  their leased land, and it was a pretty traumatic experience, from what I  understand, for the brothers.  That   s the word, but they hung in there. They fortunately had managed  to become part of other ways to make a living: banking, brokering,  buying, selling, trading, all of those things that went on in that period of  history.  I understand that William E. Berry, your  great- grandfather, his sister  helped him claim the land where the original headquarters ranch is, but  not too long after that, William E. then moved to Stillwater. Somewhere I  read that he was a member of the first town site company. Do you have  any recollection of that?  I don   t have any recollection of that. He was very, very early in  Stillwater in becoming active in the trade and the business of Stillwater.  And, as you said, he became involved in the banking business and the  forerunner of Stillwater National Bank. He and another individual  actually started that bank. Is that right?  Yes, back in the late 1800s, and then approximately 1901 he had the  bank.  Now, he joined the Mormon Church?  No, not William Edward.  It was his son, okay.  His son, Thomas Nelson. William Edward was a Methodist. In fact, you  can still look at the Stillwater First Methodist Church there on Duck and  Seventh. He gave a beautiful stained glass window that was brought in  from France. You can see it on the east side of the church. You have to  look up to see it.  Do you remember stories about your great-grandfather, William E.  Berry? You, of course, didn   t know him personally, but what stories do  you remember about him as an individual?  Well, William Edward Berry, he passed away before I was born, so I   m  just going on what I   ve heard. I heard he was a very direct person. Some  could call him grouchy. Today you   d say he had no time for small talk.  46  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  However, from stories that my father, Thomas Edward Berry, has told  me, he used to ride around with his grandfather, watch him trade, watch  him do banking right out of his buggy with horse or, depending on  where they were going, (the cars in those days were a little bit different  than we think of today) the Model T, or he went in on horseback, if  necessary. I guess you   d just call that banking right on the site. I think  that my dad   I guess you could even call that home schooling. He was  constantly challenged by his grandfather about how to trade and how  everybody should walk away feeling they got the best deal. Certain  principles (I won   t necessarily call them values) that should stand today  in banking. It was done much, much differently.  Now, your grandfather, Thomas N. Berry, and your grandmother,  Harriet, had eight children including your father, Thomas E. Berry. Did  you know many of the family members including your aunts and uncles?  Oh yes, I knew all of my aunts and uncles, some better than others, but  yes. In my earlier childhood, they were all within a very close proximity.  All of them lived in the state of Oklahoma, so they would gather either  for company meetings or for reunions or for one thing or another. To  give you an idea of the challenges that you   re giving me, this  shows  photo  is a 1941 family reunion. This is all of the descendents, basically,  of William Edward Berry and actually even his father in Kentucky.  That   s what happened then. Then a more recent reunion was held, and  this is all the descendents of William Edward that were able to attend in  1987, which again is getting to be a ways back. So, as you can see, I   m  just a little speck among a lot of people. I was very young in the 1947  picture, I   m happy to report, but I   m there with a big bow on top of my  head.  In 1987 my sons came, and they got a little taste of what it   s like to have  such a large family. You really just don   t know all of them very well,  but some better than others. But as far as all the aunts and uncles, with  some we were in and out of each other   s homes almost like they were  our parents. With others that were more distant, we saw them on special  occasions.  Did you have a sense of connection with the rest of the family? When  you got together for reunions were there family stories and these kinds  of things?  Yes, there were family stories, but at the same time, I would say some of  the stories were more to the present, catching up on what everybody was  doing. If one of us grandkids was doing something that was naughty,  everybody knew about it. (Laughter) If you were doing something a bit  more illustrious, everybody knew about it. They   d just kind of yip and  47  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  yap in the kitchen or eating or whatever. There were expectations of us  as children. We were never told what to do, but if we got out of line we  were told to stop it. It is kind of learned by getting into trouble once in a  while, I guess.  What do you remember about your grandfather, Thomas N. Berry? He  was still alive when you were young, right?  Yes.  What do you remember about him? Special memories, special times with  him?  Well, he was a very gentle man. He was always very kind to all of the  grandchildren, attentive. In his later years he carried candy in his pocket  and would give to children and that kind of thing. He became a very  devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints  Church, and he and my grandmother Berry pretty much were the  principal beginners or founders of that church in the Payne County area.  As far as learning things from him, we learned a lot from Grandmother  Berry, basic things. From Grandfather Berry, I would say I learned quite  a bit about honeybees. Back as children, he had learned from his father  how to do beehives, and he had several here at what is now Thomas N.  Berry and Company out over behind those trees. We learned and  watched and were able to learn a bit about honeybees.  We learned how to fish. Grandmother Berry was a tremendous  fisherwoman. She could go out and seemed to pull one in every time,  (Laughter) so she kind of took over in that part. We learned how to fish,  and we learned how to take care of chickens, and we   d get hurt out here  once in a while, or we   d pester the bees and they would swarm us. You  learned to dive under a tree, and if you didn   t, you were in big trouble.  So, you learned some things the hard way by hanging around out here,  which I   d come to visit pretty often.  Your grandfather, he settled initially on land across the river from the  original headquarters near Ripley. Is that correct?  The family lived in Ripley. The Thomas Nelson Berry family lived in  the Ripley area for a lot of the early childhood of their eight children.  They actually moved into Stillwater over around Husband Street in there  when they began having children that needed to go beyond eighth grade.  Thomas N. Berry, the one that first got the family involved in the oil and  gas business, do you know a little bit of the background about how he  got into the oil and gas business? Where did his interest and knowledge  48  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  about oil and gas come from?  I think part of it was the impetus of the state of Oklahoma back in the  early 1900s to the teens. That   s when it was starting in the state. I mean,  sure, in the late 1800s, but I think it was just   a lot of people, the  Mulberry Oil   Gas Company   it was a combination of his sister, Sarah  Jane Berry Mullendore and her family and also Thomas Nelson Berry.  They teamed up in the very early years. That company no longer exists.  Then Blackwell Oil and Gas was another oil and gas company way back  in the teens and into the twenties. That was a combination of some  properties and things with the Thomas Nelson family and Dora Berry  Goodson, who lived in Blackwell. That was his sister. All of that was  going on. James E. Berry was in some of it at certain points; that was a  brother. There were two brothers and two sisters that were William  Edward   s children.  As I was reading through some of the family history, it alluded to the  fact that he was very frugal and he bought a lot of land surrounding and  adjacent to his property that he had.  He did.  Then he began to branch out, in particular, to look at oil and gas  properties. Supposedly he talked about the highs and the geographic  details; you can look at it and kind of tell  if it was a good spot to dig .  How did he get his knowledge about geology and petroleum geology?  Supposedly he made a lot of good investments.  He always looked for the high ground. He figured there would be a little  blip of oil in there. You know, in the old days there was a lot of truth to  that. You   ve got to remember, it was uncharted territory. It had never  been drilled before. Today that   s not true. It   s much harder to find the  product than it used to be. You   ve got to go much, much deeper,  horizontal drilling. Technology   s changed. It honestly used to be   you  kind of looked in the little streams to see if there   s any oil in it or  something like that. He had his theories. I don   t know where he got his  training other than reading what was ever available at that time in  history or just going on some instincts. He was lucky here and there. He  also had my father and some son-in-laws who kind of fanned out and  looked for leases and/or mineral acres to buy. So, first, you have to gain  the capability of being able to drill before you can put the pipe in the  ground, as they say.  In 1929, Thomas N. Berry and family moved into this home that   s now  the headquarters of the Thomas N. Berry and Company. Of course, this  is probably pretty common now. You   re here nearly every day, but at  49  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  that time, do you remember being here and being on the property and in  the home with your grandparents? Was it always a special experience  for you to be out here with them?  Yes, we came out, I mean, not every day or anything like that. A lot of  times, on Sunday everybody paid their respects to their grandmother and  grandfather, and out we   d come. We   d run around and did naughty  things, smoked grapevine, nearly burned our tongues off. (Laughter)  That   s the worst, believe me. I never smoked after that. (Laughter)  You   d go out in the pecan orchard and cut it down, and it   s a wonder  we   re all alive. We just kind of ran wild out here, had a good time.  So, one more time about your grandfather becoming a Mormon. Was  that a little bit scandalous in the family? This was a family of  Methodists, right? And sometimes in Oklahoma in that era, frankly,  Mormons were looked at with a little bit of suspicion. Was this a shock  to the family?  I really don   t know. When I grew up, it was the way it always was. Of  course, some of the descendents of Thomas Nelson are Mormons, and  some are not. I mean, everything was certainly up to the person,  although you   re related, to make their choices in life. It was never  something that was imposed, certainly not on me. You just did your  thing. We   re always taught to respect all religions no matter from where  they came or for what they are. I   ll tell you, Mormons are very good  people and very dedicated to family, to education, to learning and  sharing with others, to dealing with the underprivileged. There were a lot  of lessons that I learned by going both to the Methodist and the Mormon  Church, so go figure that one out.  Your father, Thomas E. Berry, grew up here in Stillwater for most of the  time, right?  Ripley. He   ll say Ripley is his home base.  It was about the eighth grade when he moved to Stillwater?  More or less, I assume I have my facts accurate on that.  He attended Oklahoma State University, and he was a Sigma Nu. Is that  right?  Yes.  Did he ever talk to you about his OSU experience?  50  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Well, at that time, of course, he was working with his father going out  and getting leases in the wild and wooly Texas and around Oklahoma.  To tell you the truth, I really think he had a lot more fun doing that than  going to school. He claims he was the first captain of the golf team, only  because he owned a set of clubs. Is that true? I have no idea. There   ll be  no record of that. (Laughter) I can tell you he kept in very close touch  through the years with various people that had crossed paths at OSU.  Actually, Bill Spears    father was a Sigma Nu at the same time as my dad  was. Bill has told me a couple stories about what went on in those days,  when they couldn   t get any meat, with the Depression. They were  characters. My father did not graduate. He ended up going to work. He  certainly utilized Oklahoma State University, or Oklahoma A M, in a  lot of ways with his research on ponds, his research on using waste for  enrichment of soil, as long as you got the toxicity out of it. He worked in  the research component very quietly with OSU on various properties  with these various ideas that he might have had.  He had hounds. He used to wolf hunt a lot. All of his hounds were cared  for at the vet school at OSU. At the time, I always thought he knew  absolutely everybody on campus. I   m sure he didn   t, but he certainly  utilized the research that went on here. He was very involved in water  for the area, although here he is in oil and gas. Well, they need water to  do what they   re doing. He had some theories on that. He never  graduated. I   m not sure it was in his temperament, but at the same time,  as far he was concerned, Oklahoma A M was the place. He never left  Payne County, ever.  Do you recall which years he attended school at Oklahoma A M?  I   d have to look that up. Well, he was born in 1904, so add another ten,  twelve. It would be probably 1918, 1920, the Flapper era, you know.  Good time to be there, wasn   t it? You mentioned earlier the fact that  your father worked with your grandfather in the oil and gas business,  and he later was to become CEO of Thomas N. Berry and Company. I  understand he really helped greatly to expand it. There   s a story about  your father, and he was only eighteen, I think. He went down to Texas  and helped get some oil leases that turned out to be fairly productive.  You think about that, at age eighteen.  Well, that   s why he wasn   t such a good student. He was out running  around bringing in leases. He understood his math very well. (Laughs)  I was going to ask you a couple of questions about that. Seriously, in  terms, he was referred to as a wildcatter. Can you explain to us what a  wildcatter is?  51  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Gill  Fischer  Oh. He would take a lot of risks. I think wildcatters in those days   most  oil men were wildcatters, because i
