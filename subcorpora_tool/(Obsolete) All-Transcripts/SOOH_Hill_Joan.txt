 Little Thunder  Hill  This is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is  Wednesday , September  14,  2011 , and I   m interviewing Joan Hill as part of the Oklahoma  Native Artists Project, sponsored by Oklahoma Oral History Research  Program at Oklahoma State University. We   re at Joan   s home on Red  Bird Lane. This is land your maternal great-grandfather settled on in the  1850s after Indian Removal. Joan, you   re Creek and Cherokee. You   ve  won more awards, national and international, than any other American  Indian artist  up to 1980 , and I appreciate you taking the time to talk  with me.  I   m honored that you asked me.  Where were you born, and where did you grow up?  I was born at the Baptist Hospital here in Muskogee, and they brought  me home, I think, one day later. Here, except we lived in a house up  there. (Laughs) They built this house in 1954, my parents did. I went to  the little elementary school, one-room country school. That was Harris  School, then. When my mother was a little girl, this was their family  ranch. Papa, that was Cheasquah Harris, he was Red Bird   s son, and  Louis Jobe and a brother, Bill Harris, all went together, and they  established the little one-room country school in 1904. And they hired a  teacher, boarded him in their home, so everybody could go to school.  They had a lot of people that worked on the ranch and there was no  place for them to go to school. Papa sent his daughters to the Nazareth  (Catholic) Institute, the older ones and Mother. When she came along,  she refused to go just because she didn   t want to leave home. (Laughter)  So, then they did the one down here. Later, it was changed back to  Harris-Jobe again. Consolidated. So, I   ve lived here my entire life except  for travels. I traveled for twenty years, three or four trips a year, all over  the world. I   m glad I got to do that.  5  Little Thunder  Hill  What did your folks do for a living?  Daddy managed his property. When he was about, I guess, seven years  of age  he was born in 1897  they struck oil on his allotment.  Daddy   s  father, G.W. Hill (an attorney) was guardian until daddy came of age.  Then he went to court and had the restrictions removed.  They were  never wealthy, but the only vice my father had was smoking. (Laughter)  He didn   t drink, he didn   t gamble or any of that. He took the money that  he made and bought more land with it. At one time, he had five farms  and then Mother had hers and the home place here. For all of our  childhood, Daddy would go to each of his farms and visit all of them  each week. And we   d all go. It was so much fun. The tenants, one of  them always had roasted peanuts for us. We would stop. I remember  they would buy the fixings for a picnic and we   d have a picnic  someplace. And sometimes we   d fish.  One of the farms had a creek with fish in it, and Daddy taught my  brother how to noodle. (Laughter) I remember those were all very happy   memories . Mother was a housewife. She graduated from Oklahoma  College for Women, two-year at Chickasha, which now is the Oklahoma   College of Arts and Sciences . It   s co-ed and everything. Anyway, after  she graduated, she and Daddy got married, so she was like a housewife.  Then when my brother and I started to college, she took a job with Egan  Manufacturing Company. Daddy worked for the Southwestern Power  Administration in later years. At first, he managed his farms. He still had  his farms, but farming, like this one on the river, there   d be a drought  one year and a flood the next. Nobody in farming makes money. But  because of it being on the river, it was good for cattle.  Part of this  here in Muskogee  was my grandfather   s  Mother   s father,  Cheasquah (Papa)  ranch. It was the oldest ranch in Oklahoma. It   s not  the longest operating, but it was the oldest then because Red Bird had  started when they came here in 1858. My grandfather wanted all his  children to settle around him, so they did.  Most  all took their  allotments here. That   s why I said this is Harris Township, Mother   s  maiden name, and then there   s Harris Street, Harris Avenue, Harris  Road, and Harris Addition. (Laughter) One of the people was always  teasing me that they were going to move the Harrises off. (Laughter)     You   ve got too many things around here named for Harris,    he said.  (Laughter)  But they were all civic-minded people. My great-uncle, my grand-father   s  brother, was the first County Commissioner in Muskogee, and  he had the water put out to Hyde Park. And because it came out this  way, then the family got to attach on it, too. But for years, because we  6  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  all attached onto it, if one person was taking a bath up the line and you  started taking one down here, you could get scalded to death. When one  person turned it on, then you would have to  wait  through it. So, we   d  all have to cooperate. They used to have party lines, too. Anyway, that   s  like growing up in a rural community. It   s in the city limits now, but it  still feels like it  rural . As I said, because  of  the ice storms and  everything, all the trees fell. I feel like I have to get all of those up.  Our family cemetery is here. Red Bird is buried there and his wife. They  were both second cousins to Will Rogers, and they were second cousins  to each other. But remember, Prince Phillip and Queen Elizabeth are  second cousins to each other, too  (Laughter) Back in those days, I think  people were  so  isolated that, mostly, who they knew were relatives.  Anyway, my grandparents are buried out there and my parents are  buried there, so I want to be buried there, too   if I ever decide to die.  (Laughter) I   m going to keep going as long as I can.  You   ve mentioned in different interviews that your family were mainly  church people and you weren   t really raised around the ceremonial  grounds that much.  This is what I want to tell you, though. This is what   s important because  when I was taking the portraiture course from Dick West at Bacone,  after I taught school for four years and took art lessons  in Tulsa , I came  back home and enrolled at Bacone for the portraiture course. That   s  when Dick West said,     With your family background  it   s a shame that  you don   t do Indian painting.    I told him,    I wasn   t brought up on a  reservation like other people.    He said,    Well, you can do research. I do  research. You can do research.    So, that   s what I started doing. My  father was so happy. Grandpa Hill  George Washington Hill , his father,  was chief of the Creek Nation. 1923-28, I believe. He died in office.  They used to go to the ceremonies, not the powwows like they have  now. Daddy took Mother and I every week. We   d go to all these  different places that Daddy knew about. They   d be way out in the  boondocks, someplace you   ve never heard of.   That   s when  you were doing research for your painting?  Yes, research for my painting, yes. So, we got to see the buffalo dance  and all. I remember when we drove up to one of  the ceremonial  grounds  my mother. Now, my mother is part Indian, but she doesn   t  look a lot Indian. I asked them if I can take pictures and he said,    Well, I  don   t know. If you promise not to exploit them by publishing them.     And I said,    What I want to do is to paint them.    So, he said,    Well,  maybe.    I said,    Just a minute, let me go tell my father.    He looked over  and he said, (Daddy looked like an Indian)    What   s your father   s  7  Little Thunder  Hill  name?    I said,    William McKinley Hill.    All of them were named after  Presidents back then. So, anyway, he said,    Mack, is that you?     Daddy (they all called him Mack) he knew everybody out there. They  knew him. They were so happy. They invited us to stay for all the  ceremonies. They invited us to eat with them. It was so nice. Daddy had  a good friend with the Cherokees, Squirrel Wildcat. All the Wildcats,  they   re so good at music. Tommy  is the grandson of Squirrel . Anyway,  they invited us to come to the stomp dances, the Red Bird Smith stomp  dances. So, we got to go to all of those that, ordinarily, people who had  no connections to Indians couldn   t go to because they weren   t sure if  you would be doing it to exploit them or to make fun of them or  something like that. That   s how come I got to do so many things. I have  all the photographs I took, too, with a little Pony II camera. (Laughter)  But that took pretty pictures.  That   s wonderful.  That   s how I got into Indian painting. After Dick West lectured me at  what I should be doing. (Laughs) Anyway, he came over every  Saturday. He would bring his dog, Skipper, over and he   d walk around  the field  with my father . Never shot anything, but he gave the quail  nervous breakdowns, I think. (Laughter) They   d walk around all over  the fields, and then he   d come in and listen to the opera. Mother always  listened to the Saturday afternoon opera. Mother was a coloratura  soprano. She majored in voice and piano when she was in college. So,  she loved it. We always grew up listening to Saturday afternoon opera.  So, Dick West would come in. I had a wax head that I was going to cast,  and he would sit there, work on one side and I   d work on the other. It  was the funniest thing. (Laughter) Then, Mother, she   d always bake a  cake or something when he came over. He wanted me to enter the Indian  Annual. He said,    You   ve got to enter that.    And I said,    Well, I wasn   t  sure if I was good enough.       No, no, go on. I want you to do a painting  for it and do it good, but don   t put a hundred figures in it.    (Laughter)  And  the painting  had thirteen  That   s how I got started in Indian art. I  didn   t win the first time I entered, but the Spillers, G. C. Spillers in  Tulsa, they bought it for  100 dollars. Now, this is 1959. That was a lot  of money to me.  Then I started entering other shows because he said,    Don   t get  discouraged if you get rejected or anything. Just go on again.    He  always told the story about how he had packed up one that was rejected.  He just sent it to another show and it won the grand prize. Anyway, that  was the way he taught us to be, philosophical about it, and not be hurt  over it. He said,    Nearly everything   s been done that can be done in  8  Little Thunder  Hill  Indian art, but there   s always room for a good one.    That   s why he said  to concentrate on making yourself better. I   ve known artists who would  be real angry if they didn   t win anything. And I thought,    There   s your  wrong attitude,    because I want to learn. They used to talk about  Michelangelo had    divine discontent.    He was never satisfied with  anything he did. So, I thought,    Well, that   s good. Maybe, that I   m not  really satisfied.    So, I kept trying to improve, you know.  That was another question I had, your first exposure to Indian art as a  genre. Was it over there at Bacone, or did you have any pieces in the  house?   We had lots of books of other art but only a few pieces, pottery and  baskets, of Indian art.  I used to draw on the walls as a child. (Laughs)  My parents, in self-defense, they bought me equipment to paint with.  (Laughter) I remember Daddy, when we were growing up, when it  would frost on the windows in the wintertime, he   d draw on them. And  when it melted, you could see the image still there. Of course, mother  would always clean it with Windex.  Anyway, I mentioned about the Institute, the Santa Fe Institute. The  second year it was open, they wanted Dick West to teach. And he was  always giving me the jobs that he didn   t want, I guess. (Laughter) So,  Lloyd New, who just founded it, came to see me, and I went out there   later  to see whether I   d want to do it.  But I had just started traveling and  was  really getting started on my  career, and I thought,    If I do go out there       I remember I walked into  two galleries, showed them my photographs, my little Pony II  photographs, and both of them accepted to handle my paintings. I know  the one, Leona Kahl, had the gallery in Taos. She said,    They will drain  you dry if you   re a teacher. You   ll never really get to paint.    So, I  thought about it and I thought about it, and I finally turned it down. The  strangest thing, I was offered all these jobs. If I wanted one, I probably  couldn   t get one.  I was offered  one  at Berkley back in the    70s. I thought,    No, no, no.  They   re too wild for me.    (Laughter) Then we had the University of  Maryland. And Kentucky wanted me for the Native Studies program.  That was while my mother was ill, and I couldn   t do that. Then Haskell  offered me the job when Dick West left there, at Lawrence. Bacone had  offered me twice, and I turned them all down. Like I said, if I hadn   t  been traveling and I hadn   t already gotten started, I   d probably have  taken it. I feel like you grow more if you  are teaching painting .  The strange thing is, now, when I started   I want to mention this  9  Little Thunder  Hill  because things have changed so much   traditional painting, you could  not use anything they call mechanical aids. A lot of the artists used  airbrush for snow scenes and things, which they look beautiful to me.  Then, when they wouldn   t let them do it   they   d even reject them from  Philbrook and Gallup   they started using a toothbrush to splatter it.  That   s not considered mechanical. I wonder now about the things that  are done with the computer because several artists do things with this  computer stuff, and then they do collages with photographs. I keep  wondering about that because I think it   s in the Indian Art Law and  some of the other stuff.  I remember at Philbrook, they were very strict about that. Perfectly flat  paintings   you could not do shading on anything. Now, it   s almost  reversed and the traditional artists are practically dying out because  people are not learning it anymore. People aren   t teaching it anymore,  and it   s a shame. I believe that an artist should be free to do anything  that they want to do. I remember when they started the special category  at Philbrook. Jeannie King and Dick West were the ones that pioneered  for it, because we all wanted to do other things, too, besides the strictly  flat, two-dimensional. But I find myself going back to it. It   s satisfying,  somehow. I know one thing. I sell everything I paint in traditional  because people want it, since it seems to be a dying art. So, there should  be something where people encourage it. Anyway, that   s how I got into  Indian art. (Laughs)  Going back to that visit by Lloyd Kiva New real quickly, did you know  he was coming?  He called me and told me he was on his way over from Bacone.  (Laughter) His sister was with him. She had brought him up. Both of  their parents died, I think, when they were very young, and she was  older than he was, a lot older. Then, strangely   this is just kind of a little  aside   on the travel workshop that I was on, his teacher at the Chicago  Art Institute was there and her husband, and we got to talking. She said,     By any chance, do you know Lloyd New?    I said,    Yes, I know Lloyd  New.    She said,    We used to keep him all the time because he was  always starving. Young men are always starving.    (Laughter) She said  that he would stay with them for weekends, and they   re lifelong friends.  She was so sweet. Gertrude Hadley was her name and her husband was  Russell Hadley.  After I found out his whole record, I was very impressed because when  we went to Scottsdale, he told the story   and this is interesting, I think,  for Indian artists to know. He made a coat for some woman   s dog, a  poodle, out in Scottsdale. So, she told him,    Anything you want, if  there   s anything you need or I can do for you, I   d be glad to do it.    The  10  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  other artists had turned her down; they wouldn   t do it. He designed  clothing. So, he said,    Well, there is this little place out in the middle of  the desert here, near Phoenix. I   d kind of like a place to put a shop and a  gallery.    She said,    Where is it, exactly?    He told her and she owned it   She let him put his shop   everything. That   s how he got started. He told  the story, too. That   s where the Fifth Avenue shops came from in  Scottsdale, Lloyd New getting the woman to  help him . They owned the  property, all of it. It was out in the middle of the desert back in those  days, I guess. (Laughter)  That   s interesting. So, you went to NSU in 1952, and you got a degree in  education?  Yes, I graduated from there. I went to Muskogee Junior College for the  first two years and then to Northeastern. I graduated from Northeastern.  I got the outstanding alumnus award in 2000  (Laughs)  What made you think teaching would be a good thing?  Well, I wanted to teach art. Actually, I just wanted to paint. I used to  want to teach art, solely art, and they told me,    You can   t make a living  as an artist. You   ve got to be practical.    That   s how they talked me into  taking typing and shorthand in high school.  These were teachers, not your folks?  Parents and teachers. But my parents were wonderful in that they wanted  me to do what I wanted to do. Mother was a singer, and Daddy loved art  himself. So, they loved the arts. I know a lot of people who don   t want  their children to do anything they can   t make a living at. I know one  time they asked my brother, who was very talented, too, in art, why he  didn   t paint and he said,    Well, I just can   t figure out who would support  my family while I   m painting.    (Laughter) Anyway, that   s one of the  drawbacks. You don   t get rich unless you   re Andy Warhol with a  gimmick of some kind. Mechanical aids  They said he projected and  copied a lot of things he did. I   m not sure whether that   s really art     (Laughter)  While you were teaching at Roosevelt, you lived in Tulsa for a while.  Four years. Purely by accident, I happened to meet a family who had all  these art connections to everything. After Dr. Charles C. Mason hired  me a week before school started, he said,    Do you have a place to live?     I said,    No.    (Laughter) He said,    Well, we have people who want  teachers to live with them.    Remember, this is 1952. There are very few  apartments and things   you   d have to stay in a hotel. Anyway, he gave  11  Little Thunder  Hill  me this list and my father was taking me around   I couldn   t even drive,  then. So, we went in this place and the man who answered the door had  on an undershirt, a can of beer in his hand. He was listening to a ball  game. (Laughs) It was a very small house, and my father said,    We   d  like to meet your wife.    He said,    She   s in Kansas City at a meeting.  She   s not here.    Daddy said,    How often does she go on these trips, and  how long does she stay?    My father could sure talk when he had to.  (Laughter) So, he said,    She goes about twice a year and she stays        My father said,    Get your purse, we   re leaving.    We got up and walked  out. I don   t know what the man thought.  The second person, her maiden name had been Hill. Her daughter, later  on, she had an art gallery out in Santa Fe, Margaret Jamison. She was  married to Angus Davidson  then , who went to school with my father at  Saint Joseph when they were just seven, eight years old, back in  boarding school. So, they had all these art connections, and Grace was  my landlady. Actually, they treated me like a member of the family. I  learned a lot about life that I didn   t learn growing up. All kinds of  interesting things. They had a chauffeur who was called a driver, not a  chauffeur. And you don   t call your boat a yacht, you call it a boat, which  is interesting. (Laughter)Anyway, I met all the family. They all treated  me like a member of their family the whole time that I was in Tulsa.  I was taking night classes at Philbrook, and I met a lot of really nice  people. There was some physician   s wife who wanted to take lessons,  too. And she said,    Well, I drive right by you. There   s no sense in taking  a bus.    I wanted to go to church again, and you had to change buses to  go to church, and I   d have to get up real, real early. So, my landlady  said,    Well, I was a Baptist and now I   m a Catholic. Why don   t you go  with me to the Catholic church?    So, I asked Mother and Daddy, I said,     Do you mind?    Daddy went to a Catholic school, and Mother   s sisters  all did. They said,    No, no. Go where you want to. It   s fine.    So, I went  to church with her. As I said, they treated me like a daughter, and it was  very interesting because they knew all these people in Santa Fe and  everywhere. All the artists. They knew a lot of people. One of the  daughter   s husbands helped build the Sands Hotel  Las Vegas, Nevada .  They had gallery connections there, too. Anyway, that was interesting,  and it helped further my education in a lot of ways that I wouldn   t have  had otherwise.  Now, this is prior    you haven   t yet been to Bacone, yet.  Yes, prior, that   s right. I resigned in 1956. I taught four years in the  Tulsa Public Schools. But I want to mention, at Northeastern, the only  art we had was one semester of watercolor, one semester in oil painting.  We didn   t paint, we studied other artists work, which I   m very grateful  12  Little Thunder  Hill  that I got that. Then we had art appreciation and one semester of  perspective, which is, strangely, the only really thing that you did with  your hands,  and history of art. During my jet setting days I got to visit  many places we had studied . Working with it, I learned to appreciate a  lot of art that I hadn   t at first. I remember Marie Laurencin. She paints  paintings of women with no noses. Later on, I met a lot of these people,  like for instance, Fleur Cowles , she did this gorgeous magazine. She  was an artist. My friend,  Thurman,  and I happened to be in Rio De  Janeiro the night of her opening show. I told her that my landlady had  given me the complete set of her gorgeous magazines. They were so  expensive they only published them for one year. I   ve got the whole set.  They   re probably worth a fortune. She wanted to buy them from me   (Laughter) I said,    Oh, I just love them  I   ll have to see.    I was trying to  think of her name. She  Fleur Cowles  was real famous for doing  animals like tigers and lions and all kinds of things like that.  Anyway, at a lot of these things you meet other people, and I found out  that people are interested in people who are artists. And writers.  Strangely, I have a lot of friends who are writers, too. Writers and  musicians. I was in the Pen Woman branch that they had in Tulsa. I  remember that most of them were writers. They had one or two artists,  and so I entered their show. The first time I entered, I won every first  prize. There was a lot of objection to it. (Laughter) I never entered again.  They didn   t like it,  that I won all the first prizes . That   s all I can say,  they didn   t like it. (Laughs)  The second show that I entered was in Santa Fe. Vincent Price was the  judge, and he picked  my painting  for the Professional Prize, whatever  it was that was next to the Grand Award. And they bought it for the  museum. Years later, I wanted him to judge our Muskogee show when I  was down here. He actually talked to me on the phone, and his manager  had written me a couple cards because we wanted him to judge the  show. He explained why he was so busy, he couldn   t. Then, years later,   he was  filming in Venice when we were there. I didn   t get to see him  because he rarely showed up in the daytime. Like a vampire. (Laughter)  Anyway, they had filmed Clockwork Orange before that   this was in  1972. So, the whole movie company was there at our hotel where we  were. That was interesting, just little things that you learn about life. I  know one thing, people would write in the calendars,    Joan Hill was  born in Muskogee, and she still lives there.    That   s it. They don   t  mention that I   ve been all over the world  (Laughs)  Right  So, at Northeastern, you didn   t get to do a lot of applied stuff, but  the Philbrook, you did.  One thing we did  at Northeastern  was like a sculpture class. We  13  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  studied  Alexander  Calder   the mobiles. And the one that is so famous  with the mustache, the surrealist painter     Dali.  Yes, yes, yes. Loved him. Anyway, we got to do something with that. I  remember, I made this real abstract thing. It was mounted in plaster of  Paris and came up and everything. (Gestures) (Laughter) But like I said,  we didn   t get to really  do  artwork.  Now, all of the artists have such a wonderful advantage. I remember  when I turned down the job at Santa Fe, I said,    I   d like to go here to  school     When we were there, I met all the artists and teachers. Allan  Houser said,    Where are you going after this?    Mother and Daddy were,  of course, with me and I said,    We   re going to go paint at E-town   Elizabeth town . It   s a ghost town between Santa Fe and Taos.    He  said,    If you hold on, I   ll get my brushes and I   ll go with you     Lloyd  New walked in about then and he said,    Oh, no. We   ve got a teacher   s  meeting in thirty minutes.    He said,    Oh, shucks.    I met Otellie  Loloma   gorgeous thing  She was married to Charles Loloma. And her  beautiful sculptures looked like her. They were just marvelous. Of  course, Charles Loloma had gorgeous jewelry, just beautiful things.  Louis Ballard, who did the Four Moon   s Ballet, we went over to visit  him in his studio. Suzanne Heard, who   s a good friend, worked for the  Department of Interior here, for the Education Department.  Louis  had  this grand piano inside this building, and that   s practically all that was in  there, just this grand piano and all the walls around it. That was  interesting because he was a real famous musician. R.C. Gorman, bless  his heart, every time I   d win a prize   see, he autographed that for me up  there. (Gestures) Every time I   d win a prize, he   d send me a postcard  congratulating me. I wish I had known when he was sick in the hospital  and dying. I would have sent him flowers because he sent me flowers  one time. He was always so kind.  He was kind to a lot  of people , very encouraging.  Yes, he was sweet and so interesting. But his studio in Taos   they put  me on several of the task forces for the Department of Interior   I loved  going on those. They wanted to visit to R.C. Gorman, and we went to his  gallery. One of the people with us asked,    Can we come in and visit?     They said,    No, he   s working.    Then this good friend of mine said,    I  have Joan Hill with me.    And all of a sudden, here came these pattering  footsteps down the  stairs   (Laughter) He ran out, opened the door, and  invited us all in, and we got to watch him work. So, it was wonderful.  Wonderful people.  14  Little Thunder  Hill  When Allan Houser wasn   t able to go with you because he had a  teacher   s meeting, that kind of proves that point, that you wouldn   t have  time to paint if you taught. Do you feel that was the correct decision?  I will tell you, they offered me a very special deal. Because after I turned  them down the first time, Lloyd New said,    We   ll send you        There  were  so many things that were wonderful.    We    ll send you to school in  Paris in the summers.    I remember the good friend of mine that was  there, David Young, he worked for the Department of Interior. He  studied with Picasso way back and Fernand L  ger and different ones.  Lloyd said,    If you teach and you   re worried about not having time to  paint, we   ll let you have an extra day off. Of course, you   ll take a cut in  salary, but you would teach four days and then you   d have the rest of the  time to paint.    I considered it, but I guess I was falling in love by then  with the owner of the workshop. (Laughter) And my work was selling. I  remember I took a book of photographs. I had one photograph of each  painting. Now, I take a whole roll of them. Got smarter because people  would ask to borrow them and sometimes I wouldn   t get them back.  This one place, that Dick Seeger Gallery, was gorgeous. In Scottsdale.  When we were there, I went in and showed him my paintings, and he  took me as one of his artists. The woman that worked with him said,     Do you know how lucky you are?    I said,    How do you mean?    She  said,    We have twenty artists that come in here in a week or more, and  he doesn   t want their work, but he wants yours.    He traded with me. He  had a contract with Boeing Air that does the planes. He did the dividers  for the first-class section. He traded  two hangings for two of my  paintings . I had a collage and a gouache painting with him. I never  really did have much paintings to send him because people would come  here to buy them.  Then that was when Leona Kahl had her gallery in Taos. That   s when  she talked me into letting them handle paintings. She was moving, doing   a gallery  in Dallas, so I did. I let them represent me for a while, but the   manager  wanted to sign me to a contract. And I said no because, what  he wanted me to do   he only wanted me to do the oil paintings on  canvas. Indian paintings. I did Indian paintings. He was part Indian  himself. He said when I had my show there, the Indians came out of the  woodwork in Dallas. He said,    I never saw so many Indians      Jack Kilpatrick, who is just a legend with the Cherokee, and his wife,  Anna Kilpatrick, came to the opening. I was trying to think     her name is Raven  Hale , and she did all these beautiful theatrical  things about Sam Houston and about Tiana Rogers. My mother, when  we got up and walked out, she was talking to my father in the car (after a  15  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  while he went back out and sat in the car). She said,    Well, I couldn   t  get near you to talk so I thought I   d talk to your father.    (Laughter) So  many people  I had met this woman on this Greek Island cruise, and her  son -in-law  was President of the  Cotton  Exchange  in Dallas, Texas ,  and he collected art. Indian art, too, but mainly the Ashcan School. They  bought several of my paintings. And between them and this other  person, they filled the gallery with flowers. It was so wonderful. They  were really wonderful people. I know that the reporter for the Dallas  Morning News did this wonderful article about my show.  Was it a one-woman show?  Yes, a one-woman show.  Do you remember the year, approximately?  It was 1966 because years later, I met a man who said,    I remember  you.    This is probably ten, fifteen years later. He said he kept the  brochure. He said,    I remember that painting.    It was a Pueblo study of  lights and darks, and it was done in a circle. That painting was sold.      You almost made a collector of Indian art out of me.    He really loved  it. He went to see my show, but he didn   t come to the opening.  Anyway, I want to make this point. God has been very good to me. He  blessed me with parents who encouraged me. Mother played the piano  for church and Sunday school when she was pregnant with my brother  and I. (Laughs) So we started going to church and Sunday school back  then  in Mother   s womb. Everybody in our families had been baptized .  The fact that people would help me, people would like me and they  would help me, was wonderful. I remember after I entered the Philbrook  show, Solomon McCombs and Fred Beaver and different ones, would  invite me to show with them. That was a big honor because they were all  professionals and I was just starting. Anyway, that prize, like I said, I got  it at the museum in New Mexico. Then at Philbrook, the next year, I got  second prize in the Woodland division.  I met Acee Blue Eagle just before he died. He was real sick then. I  remember that when I was teaching school, Wolf Robe Hunt had made  some beautiful jewelry for  my landlady   s  daughter. They came out and  she said,    Oh, I have this little Indian girl that teaches school. She   s an  artist, I   d like you to meet her.    Acee Blue Eagle and Wolf Robe Hunt  stayed about two hours to meet me, and I didn   t show up. After school,  all of the teachers would meet at a coffee shop, and we   d discuss  everything. So, I was late coming home. (Laughter) I got a mild balling  out for that. But do you know that Acee Blue Eagle remembered that?    I  waited to meet you,    he said.  That was 1956 when they waited, and I  16  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  met him at Philbrook in1959.  I felt terrible because I don   t like to hurt  people   s feelings or anything. But that was the last time he entered. I  have the catalog   I think it was the    59 show. I guess it was. No, that  was the first one. The one where I won the second prize was the next  year,  1960 .  I remember he had a gorgeous, gorgeous painting. It was the Haida  Indians, you know up in the Northwest Coast? He had won on that. I  remember Dick West had all of us go on the bus from Bacone. We all  went over there together to the opening of the Indian Annual. He said,     Acee is changing his style.    I remember him saying that. Dick West  would go around and he   d point out the things in the paintings that were  good and different things.    One thing to remember,    he said.    When  they have a winner in one Indian Annual, you have to look out because  the next year you   ve got clones of what won the Grand Prize.    (Laughs)  He said,    Be different, do something different.    So, we did. I said Dick  West was very good because he helped me. When I started, the only  Indian woman artist I knew of was Pablita Velarde. Of course, I loved  her work after I got to know about her. And then Valjean Hessing, Ruthe  Jones, and I was trying to think, who was the other    They were the  only ones that I really knew that were doing Indian art.  Jimmie Carole Fife?  No, not then. She   s quite a bit younger than I am. There is one thing  about being older    (Laughter) I got to meet all of these wonderful  artists while they were still alive  Now, I find myself, I   m the older  generation. In fact, we were talking about something and I said,    I   m the  only one of the original six Masters who is still alive.    (Laughs)  Was it hard being an Indian woman artist? There weren   t a lot of  women.  A lot of  men artists  helped me   I was the only woman artist they  knew, I guess. There weren   t many women painting then. If there were, I  didn   t know them. But I remember Valjean and I remember Ruthe, and  they were always so sweet to me and so kind. Everybody was. In  general, I would say everybody that I met in some way contributed to  my career. They   d get word about a show and they   d say,    Okay, you  need to enter this show.    So, I would do it. Then I started winning a lot  of things. I got the Grand Award. Al Momaday was the judge, I  remember, when I got the Grand Award. But Charles Banks Wilson,  who says he   s not Indian, bless his heart,  in every show he judged I  won a good prize .  Where was the Momaday award given? Anadarko Indian Fair?  17  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  Yes, Anadarko. Scott Momaday, it   s his father. I got to meet him, too.  You   d meet this person and they   d introduce you to somebody else, and  then you   d meet them. At the Indian art shows, my mother and father  used to go with me to the art shows at Philbrook. Daddy would come in  to hear the prizes, and then he   d go back out and sit in the car. Then  there were a lot of other people, like the full-bloods, they   d all go out to  the car and talk to Daddy. (Laughter) They didn   t stay around for the  festivities as much.  I loved Philbrook. I wish they would do that again  the way they used to  do it , the Indian Annual, because it was really wonderful. The year I got  the Waite Phillips Trophy, someone said,    You better get one while  they   re handing them  out , because I hear they   re not going to have  them anymore.    I said,    Oh, I think that   s terrible     I remember when  they gave the first one. I think Solomon  McCombs  was the  third  one  and then Fred Beaver  got the first one  and then Dick West  got the  second one . And I remember thinking,    I   ll have to be a hundred years  old before I get one     So, I was just really floored in 1973. (Pointing)  Tell us again the significance of the Waite Phillips  award      It is supposed to transcend all other awards. It has a diamond in the  torch. I wanted to put it in a necklace. My mother said,    No, no, it might  be bad luck. Leave it in there.    (Laughter) So, I kept it. This isn   t a lot  about my Indian art career, but all of this somehow helped contribute to  my Indian art career. I was going to mention how we did research, too.  At the public library, the Muskogee Public Library, they had what they  call the Grant Foreman Room. You couldn   t check anything out of there.  There were no copy machines   I know this sounds like the dark ages,  and in a way it was. (Laughs) I took my portable typewriter, which is  sitting down there that Daddy bought me for my first year at school   NSU . (Gestures) Mother would copy things longhand. I have pages  and pages where we copied the ethnology reports and everything.  Everything that was interesting. So many of the things, I had seen them  in person when Daddy took us to the stomp dance grounds. I got to not  only read about them there, but I got to see them, too. I think Daddy  influenced me a lot.  I   ve always done things that I hoped would promote the image of Native  Americans. One woman told me, she said,    It hurts my feelings.    She  said,    I was born in America, and I   m a Native American.    I said,    Of  course you are     (Laughs) I said,    I usually say,    I   m a Native American  Indian.    That way you   ve got it all     (Laughter) Anyway, with the  research   and of course, they   re still doing a lot of good things with  research   you had to be careful. The woman who was the interior  18  Little Thunder  Hill  designer for the Department of the Interior was Kitty Massey, and she  was part Cherokee. When they had us flown to Washington  Ed  Edmondson, our congressman, flew four of us to D.C. for honor  exhibition , she came over and said,    They tell me you have Cherokee  blood.    I said,    Yes,    and then she grabbed me and started hugging me.  She said,    I buy paintings.    She had a dream job, and they didn   t replace  it when she retired. She went all over the United States buying art for the  public buildings. And at first, the Department of the Interior had the  galleries and the show.  For Indian artists?  Yes, for Indian artists. She bought other things too, for other buildings,  but she bought Indian art because she was part Indian, and I think that  was good. I guess if she had been not Indian, she wouldn   t have had that  interest, maybe. And then, she would have just bought the others. She  commissioned two huge paintings that are out in the Albuquerque office.  She wanted  them  to be of the Pueblos. I said,    That   s alright. I   ll do  this.    Dick West said,    You usually stick to your own tribe, especially if  it   s something that somebody can find fault with because if they can,  they will.    (Laughs)  Anyway, I   ve always been very careful to try to do things that are  authentic, and don   t make up things. When I wanted to do strictly  creative stuff, then if it   s Indian and it can be tied to Indians in a way,  that   s okay. I won the Grand Prize at the Tulsa State Fair when I was  first starting out. I wanted to be Art Director for the Muskogee Art Guild  because you got to pick the teachers. I got to be the Art Director, and  this one teacher had us do something that was really interesting. You  soak a rag in turpentine and you have these different colors, and you dip  it in part of the color here, and then you stand back and you throw it at  the canvas. Then, as it runs, you see all these things in it.  One of them   and this was strictly abstract/expressionist   was the one  that won the Grand Prize. I think I called it Massacre, which really   it  could have been anything. In fact, it could   ve been for Custer or some of  the other people. I think Custer had it coming. (Laughter) Anyway,  sometimes you can do something strictly abstract, and you can see  things in it. In fact, that one over there, it   s called the Night Hawks  The  whole title was Meeting of the Snakes and the Nighthawks. It was an  organization to fight allotment . (Gestures) It   s on the calendar.  Somebody bought it. I feel like these are my children. (Laughs) I always  like to know what happens to them.  My cousin   s son is buying up all my old things that people have put on  the Internet. He   s a Major. He   s stationed over in Dubai or someplace.  19  He said,    You   re big on the Internet over there.    I said,    I don   t have the  Internet here     (Laughter) But they   ll send me stuff that people put in  there. Somebody used to say,    I don   t care what you say about me, as  long as you spell my name right.     I do. I do care because I was brought up in a Christian home, and I want  people to know that. But I love other nationalities, too. When  Thurman  and I were with the art workshops and were in Japan and different  places like that, we visited all their sacred shrines. The only place I  refused   I would not go in to look at Lenin. I did go see Mao Tse  Tung   s body.  When we were there, in Moscow, it was at the height of the Cold War.  I   ll just give this example. We were on our way to the Museum of  Atheism and I protested a little bit. My fianc  e, said,    Well, they   ll call  you the ugly American.    So, we got  near  there   oh, I wanted to tell  you, the bus broke down. There was this gorgeous church. One of the  Czars had been murdered in it. It had this beautiful blue dome and it was  in the next block, and I asked the guide,    Oh, can we stop and take a  picture of that?    And she says,    No. We are not going there. We are  going to Museum of Atheism and Communism.    That was it.  Okay, we started. When they turned, we were going to go right in front  of this church. The bus broke down. We never got to the museum   (Laughter) We all jumped out and started taking pictures and drawing.  You can   t convince me that that bus broke down by accident. I think it  broke down on purpose, so we didn   t have to go to that museum. But  like I said, when we got to Lenin, I really did have a headache and I said,     I don   t feel like standing in line to go in.    When we went to China, I  did go and look at Mao Tse Tung. I know there was this awful joke. One  of them said,    Oh, this is a peasant under glass,    a take on    a pheasant  under glass.    A lot of people didn   t get it. I got it, but I didn   t like it. I  guess  Mao  was good for them.  When we were going to our church and Sunday School down here at  Harris School, they used to host the missionaries at Bacone. They would  come over to our church   all the different denominations. I remember  they sent her  Goldie Bergsten  to China. And since I am as old as I am,  I knew her. (Laughs) She was there before the Communist Revolution.  When the Communist Revolution came along, they  fled  to the  Philippines. Whenever she would come through here, I   d go pick her up  at the bus station and take her to eat. She worked with   I think they  were Pentecostal Holiness. For years, while she was alive in the  Philippines, whenever I   d sell a painting, I   d send her money because  her Jeep was always breaking down. She had this young Filipino boy, I  think he wrecked it one time. And they had a time keeping it. (Laughs)  20  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  But, anyway, then she died. She was so sweet.     Back in the U.S.   they  loved Indians,    she said. In fact, when I first met Thurman, who owned  the workshop   his brother is married to a part Cherokee. He said,     We   re all Indian lovers at our house,    he said. (Laughter)  The workshop was there in Arizona?  The workshops were all over the world. They were not for Indian art, but  they were for general art. A lot of people went that just wanted to go.  You studied with a teacher and then you went out and painted on your  own. Then you came back and you got a critique. The ones in Rome and  those things, that   s where I did those.  So Thurman was the promoter of the workshop?  He owned all the workshops.  He didn   t teach all of them?  Some. He taught sometimes. He had a group   one for architects and one  for interior designers and then for artists. So, whenever we   d go to these  foreign countries, he knew people everywhere, and they would invite us  into their homes. We   d see all these beautiful, beautiful homes. And the  artists, we   d get to meet them, and they were so nice. In Rio de Janeiro,  they put us on television. And in Lima, Peru. There   s only one thing that  was bad about it. Like when I was in China, I was drawing the Temple  of Heaven. I have it somewhere, a sketch of it. They all crowd around  you, watching. You can   t even move your elbows back. (Laughter)  The Indian painting   I had my Indian madonnas with me that I had  done, Christmas cards. So, we were invited to go to the English  Language Institute. Now, this was back when China had just been  opened. Kissinger and Nixon had just opened it. We were the first group  of tourists. We had to write a letter  explaining  why we wanted to go. I  told them because Chinese art was akin to American Indian painting. In  other words, they wanted you to be someone that was really interested in  art because it was an art tour.  I was trying to think of who   oh, she had worked for the CIA, and I  remember Thurman told me in confidence   and it   s all over now  because she   s dead, too. Anyway, she said they didn   t want anybody  who worked for the government. They didn   t want anybody that had  anything to do with anything  along that line . That   s what Thurman  said. And she had worked for the CIA for twenty-five years, but she was  just clerical. She wasn   t approved to any secrets or anything. (Laughter)  21  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  I showed the madonnas when we were at the Institute where they had all  the paintings. They just fell in love with the Indian madonnas. Mr. Hu,  that was his name, he invited me to have a one-woman show in China,  via photographs. When I got back, unfortunately my little Pony II was  the only pictures I had, but I sent them to him. He said they were  circulated all over the People   s Republic of China. I would have liked to  have known   there   s a lot of places my work goes, and I don   t even  know where it is. (Laughs)  You mentioned that your mom helped you with some of the ethnographic  reading. Did they help with shipping or framing?  Oh, Daddy made my stretchers and my frames for me. Mother would do  all of the writing and correspondence. This real wealthy woman that had  secretaries and everything, one of the wealthiest women in the United  States   I had to share a room with  her in China.  The bed was pre-revolutionary,  and I clung to the side of the bed all night to keep from  rolling onto her. But she gave all this money to everything she did, and  she loved Indian art. She said,    When you come up with a real far-out  piece, I want to see it.    She had paid three million dollars for what  looked like netting with a lump of cheese here, a lump of cheese there.  But she had a Robert Motherwell painting that filled the whole foyer of  her apartment. (Laughter) She and her cousin, they were grandchildren  of Brigham Young   s. She wanted me to send her everything about my  career. She said,    I know a lot of people who can help you.    See, total  strangers, practically, will do that.  What year was this?  This was 1978 because, I remember, they didn   t open China until, I  think it was    76 or something like that. I remember women worked in  the streets at night with jackhammers. When we were staying in a hotel,  it was not in Beijing proper, it was out. Real beautiful place. Had this big  courtyard, nobody locked their doors. To get to the courtyard, you went  through the bedrooms. We had our show, and I had my Indian  madonnas. And they wanted to know what was the significance of this.  They had halos on, I thought,    Well, maybe they   re really serious.     So,  I told them it was Christian symbols, but I felt sort of foolish saying that  because I thought,    Surely they know this     But I thought,    Well, on the  off chance that they don   t, I will.    That was why he wanted the show of  my Indian paintings. I got to do Indian paintings in China. (Laughter)  You did a mural for the Seattle Performing Arts Center, is that right?  Yes. They wanted to buy paintings, easel paintings for their offices for  the Seattle Daybreak Performing Arts Center. They had that one percent  22  Little Thunder  Hill  for art, so they sent me what they wanted, and I sent in some slides of  easel paintings. And they wrote back and told me I had won one of their  mural competitions. I said,    But I   ve never done a mural.    I remember  telling Dick West that and he said,    That   s okay, you can learn     He was  always pointing fingers, saying,    You can learn.    (Laughter) And I did.  I remember that was almost like kind of a nightmare. We had to take  everything out of here, even the curtains, because  the mural  was eight  by twelve, and the ceiling  here  is not quite eight feet. So, I painted with  it slanted outward and when I wanted to look at my painting, I   d go  outside and look through the windows. Couldn   t have any speakers,  nothing else could get in here. And it had to be stretched. Usually, you  stretch your canvas upside down. This had to be stretched from the top.  It was put together with screws. Fredrix   they made that one for me, not  Daddy.  But my Daddy invented something. It was so big that when I wanted to  do detail stuff, it was lying flat on the floor and I would crawl out as far  as I could and paint. Daddy said,    If you had something to lean on        He got some big two by fours. He basically made me a bridge that was  wide enough so you could lean on it, and then it straddled the painting.  And I would crawl out on that. That   s how I did the details. I won a five  thousand dollar prize and I remember at the time, I spent fully half of it  on art supplies. I thought,    Gee, I   m glad that was just before the prices  suddenly  went up . When the so-called oil shortage came along,  everything, like a little tiny tube of paint at Looboyle   s, I used to get at  Looboyle   s Art Supplies. What used to be like seventy-eight cents  suddenly shot up to two dollars. There   s one beautiful color: rose  madder genuine. When I finally could find it, it   s like fifteen dollars a  tube. Back then, it was only like a dollar. But when the oil prices went  down, they didn   t lower their prices.  No. (Laughter) I understand your mom helped you as well.  Yes, she did, lots of times. Back then, I could paint twenty hours. I  remember I was working on a deadline, and I   d painted so long that the  brush just rolled out of my hands and rolled across the painting. I  couldn   t hold the brush anymore. But she always helped me. I   d stand  and eat and paint. (Laughter) They just did everything to help me.  Mother did my secretarial work. What I mentioned about that woman  that was so wealthy   she had a secretary all the time. I said,    I don   t  envy anybody  for  money or anything else, but I envy  them  their  secretary.    (Laughter)  I don   t think that I would have done as well as I did without the parents  that I had because they helped me so much. My brother, being a business  23  Little Thunder  Hill  man, he became a manufacturer   s rep and was very successful at it. He  was always giving me business advice and everything. He helped me. I  would do my own income tax, but then I   d take it over to Tulsa, and  we   d run it through his Turbo Tax thing. (Laughter) Anyway, they were  wonderful.  That   s a huge help. In 1990, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act was passed,  and I wondered if you remembered the impact of that on galleries and  individual artists in Oklahoma.  I know it hurt a lot of people, I know that. But since I came up in the  time as an artist when anybody said they were Indian, you just believed  them. You didn   t question it. So, I still don   t question it. I know that it  hurt a lot of people, but it   s good for the people who were just plain  neglected. Kitty Massey, the one I mentioned that worked for the  Department of the Interior, she went around buying paintings and  jewelry.  She gave good prices.  I know that sometimes unscrupulous  dealers would go out to reservations. They   d buy pottery for just  pennies. Then they   d bring it back and they   d make a big profit out of it.  The Indian Art Law helped those people. So, that was really wonderful.  For the ones that were hurt, in a way, I guess I can see both sides of it. I  am Creek and Cherokee, all documented. All my family, except my  great-grandfather, signed up on the Creek Dawes Roll. Okay. He went  on the Cherokee Dawes Roll, and he died six weeks before it was  finalized so that he was struck from the Cherokee roll because they  didn   t have enough land to go around for those living    actually, they  were all Cherokee tribal members to begin with. They came here, and  they were taken back into the tribe. Then the Dawes thing came along  where you had to choose, he chose the Cherokee Nation. He was only  Cherokee, he wasn   t Creek. His wife was Creek and Cherokee. Anyway,  the way that was done I could not enter the all-Cherokee shows anymore  because I   m a Creek tribal member. But everybody knows I   m  Cherokee. Just like the woman with the housing thing when we were  talking about the Federal Trade Commission. She said,    Just as long as  you have Cherokee ancestors.    I said,    Yes, I do. I can prove it.     My great-uncle was chief  1891-1895  of the Cherokee Nation. Daddy   s  father was chief and some uncles on the Creek side. He was part  Cherokee, too. Daddy   s  grand father was, too. The other was my great  uncle, C.J. Harris. He was brother to Red Bird Harris. Red Bird is my  great-grandfather. Red Bird practiced in hanging Judge Parker   s court.  He was an old frontier attorney, and my grandfather said they used to  have to cut wood all night for his father to study. He passed the bar at  Fort Smith, and he practiced there and in Muskogee. I have some of his  letterheads. His stories were so interesting because my grandfather said  24  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  they would wake up in the night, and said the outlaws would come  through and they would consult his father. (Laughter) I think I got off  track again.  (Laughs) That   s fine. Now, you built a studio to work in. When did you  build that?  That was in 1972. The prehistoric Indian mound is just outside my door  out there, and our family cemetery  is  on the other side of that. The day  that I think is the most overwhelming, I had fourteen people come to my  studio.  A  man and his wife who were from Washington   they lived in  Short Hills, New Jersey, but he worked in New York and he was on the  Phillips Board. Clemm McSpadden, the one who   s a real famous rodeo  announcer, he and his wife came with them on one of their trips. Then  we had people, several, from the ammunition depot down in McAlester,  they came. It got to the point where they had to commission them  because I ran out of paintings.  The man from London who came, he worked for Roger Wheeler. He ran  their corporate office for Telex in London. He came and brought a man  from New Zealand with him. The one from London bought three  paintings. I remember after I did them, I asked him how he got them  back. They let him put them in the cockpit. That   s how long ago it  was   1976   on the flight back to London  It   s amazing, because they  could take anything  The paintings   I guess they didn   t want to put  them in the hold, the cargo hold. I know from flying enough myself,  they didn   t have what they call    the bus.    Because then they were like  737s for shorter flights. They put them in the cockpit to take back.  (Laughter)  So, you just had to paint constantly because people would call and drop  by     I hesitate to do that now because the crime is so terrible and everything.  But back then, if anybody called, I just said,    Come on.    I had this call  from a man who was representing the University of Denver, and he had  two people, one from Madras   that   s how she pronounced it   from  India. They called me. They said they were calling from Philbrook. I  didn   t have caller-ID or any of that right after my parents died, so I said,     Yes, come on.    My brother happened to call after that and I was telling  him about it, and he said,    You don   t know whether they were from  Philbrook or where they were calling from     I said,    Well, I   ll just take a  chance and see what happens     (Laughter) They were just wonderful.  They were so sweet. They brought me flowers, beautiful flowers, a  bouquet of flowers. But they were who they said they were. (Laughs)  25  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  You paint mostly in acrylic on canvas?  I love oil on canvas, but I got allergic to my oil paints. Whenever I paint  with oil paints, I have to put that exhaust fan on.  It seems like your color changes with your style.  When I first started doing Indian painting, Dick West told me,    Since  you   re afraid of color   everything I used, I grayed it or toned it down     I want you to do a painting where you don   t mix anything up. Just use  the colors that appeal to you and use the pure pigment.    That   s when I  got started doing them. Then, when I did the black and white and red,  like this one over there (Gestures), I won a prize on everything I entered.  They just struck a note with people.  Then I started doing polymer sand collages. A friend of mine, her  husband was a geologist and they used oil well fracture sand in  collages   she did   when I was at the Muskogee Art Guild. So, I said,    I  wonder if they   d let me have like a quart of it over at Bristow.    I went  by there and they gave me a whole 100-pound sack of it. (Laughter) The  sand is so pure, it   s been washed so much that they use it when they  fracture oil wells. You can use it with polymer. I remember Woody  Cochran at TU, he wanted to trade with me. He did that, too. He would  use real leaves and do a collage with polymer. You have layer after  layer, and it looks stained glass. That was his technique. Every  sand   one that I entered in Scottsdale won, too. After I got over being afraid of  color, then I started to use brighter colors. But I still tone them down  from different things I like.  You mix them     Yes, but I went through my blue period. This is funny. Pat Lester, who  published this  Native artists  dictionary thing, he brought that painting   colors  up. That   s right, he did. I asked him if he would be interested in  it because he told me, he said,    When you get something you think I   d  like, tell me.    So, I called him. I remember I was taking it to K.C. Lab to  have it photographed. He met me there after and he was showing me   photos of  his collection. He has a wonderful collection, wonderful  people, he and his  wife , Pat and Patty. Anyway, he said,    Patty wanted  me to ask you, is this your blue period, your purple period, or your  yellow period?    (Laughter) I said,    I don   t know.     I did go through a period where I did all yellows and oranges. I had a  collector from Oklahoma City, just loved her. She and her husband  would come over. She said,    I want a yellow painting. I   ve got one of  every other of your kind of paintings. I want a yellow painting.     26  Little Thunder  Hill  Little Thunder  Hill  (Laughter) So I did one that had a lot of yellows and oranges in it.  Mother loved yellow because it   s a happy color, she said. It is. I like  pink. Pink   s a happy color, too.  You have that unusual use of negative space for a certain type of image.  When I said there was a teacher that did portrait painting, that was here  in Muskogee. I joined the Art Guild, which started out kind of like a  social club. There was a group of us, about five of us, who were all  young. I was still in my twenties then. I think I was twenty-five, twenty-four  or twenty-five. Anyway, we started doing that, and I remember the  teacher. Her name is Laurie  Wallace . She lives in Tulsa and did  beautiful portraits. I remember she said,    The negative space is just as  important as the positive space. Don   t forget that.    That   s the first time I  was really conscious of negative space. So, then I was careful, and I  thought more about composition. Because all my life I thought I was  strong in all areas except composition. So, I set out to make composition  my thing that I could do.  It   s just like   I remember when it was the Art Guild member   s turn to  pose the model, they   d always hide the hands so they didn   t have to do  hands. I wanted to do hands because I thought,    I   m weak in that area.    I   filled  sketchbook after sketchbook. I did nothing  but  hands, feet,  toes, fingers, fingernails, ears   everything that didn   t come real, real  naturally. Now, I can do them in my sleep if I have to. (Laughter)  When you can   t do something, it   s a challenge. I like challenges. You go  to work and you overcome it or you at least get good enough to live with  it. That   s why I think people, whenever they run up against an obstacle,  don   t give up. Fight. Fight back. (Laughs)  How important is story for you in a painting?  I love historical stories and a lot of them, Daddy told these. I want to tell  this about The Little People. I had done a painting of Little People and  Daddy told me that when he was a little boy, he laid out in the woods all  day, hoping to see the little people. And he never did. When he was  dying, he had cancer. I had done a painting of the Little People and I  said,    Now, Daddy, you can see the Little People.    So, he saw them in  my paintings. But the stories that he told, too, his grandmother   this  was his Cherokee grandmother. He had a Cherokee grandmother and a  Creek grandfather, but she enrolled on the Creek Dawes Commission  as  a Creek  because she was married to a Creek. Her full sister is enrolled,  as I said, on the Cherokee roll as a full-blood Cherokee.  Anyway, this is what his grandmother told him. When you see the  27  trails   see, this is the crawdads   when you see the trails along and the  little holes under there, this is where the little people live. The ones that  are in the bottom of the lake. One of those that I did, the OIA  Office of  Indian Affairs  gave to Ada Deer, and she had it hanging in her office in  Washington at the Department of Interior. When you see the bubbles  coming up, that   s the Little People down there. And whenever you lose  your fish off the hook, that   s the Little People. They let it loose, they  untie your line. (Laughter)  But the history things are so interesting. I want to especially mention,  The Crazy Snake Uprising. Crazy Snake was a full-blood Creek, who  wanted the old ways that the treaties guaranteed them, that their tribal  land would be tribal land as long as waters flow and the sun rises     that was one of them. As long as the sun rises and the waters flow. They  protested the Dawes Roll. When Henry Dawes did that, I read his quote  where he said that the Indians would never prosper or go forward  because as long as they had their land, they never got off that land. They  would just stay there and do that. And Indians were prospering again, by  that time. He basically said, unless you kick them off the reservation     that   s what it was   they would never amount to anything. That   s why he  wanted to break up the tribe. A lot of people say,    Oh, he did it for  good.    I don   t think he did it for kind reasons at all. The thing I can   t get  over is that a part Indian, a Kaw, one that was with the Department of  the Interior, he was all for breaking up the tribal land, too.  Now, in my family, our family kept all their allotments, so they  prospered by them. But Crazy Snake was one of the ones who was a  member of the Four Mothers Society. I   ve done two paintings about it.  The four   all except the Seminole tribe, I don   t know why they weren   t  involved, too   but all of them wanted to keep the old ways, the old  treaties. Red Bird Smith was one of them. So, Crazy Snake, at the  time   I want to read this.    This is an eyewitness description by my  father as a child. My grandfather had told him to come look at a long  line of horsemen riding by. He said,    Son, you are looking at history.     The horsemen were Chitto Harjo, Crazy Snake, and his men who were  fleeing from persecution. They stopped to water their horses at G.W.  Hill   s home near Hitchiti.     Now, Grandpa Hill was a Deputy U.S. Marshall who was deputized. He  wasn   t chief then, but he was deputized as part of the ones  Lighthorse   that were supposed to catch Crazy Snake.  G.W. Hill was captain of the  Lighthorse.  And he let Crazy Snake water his horses. (Laughter)  Anyway, (Reading from paper)    He  Crazy Snake  was an intelligent,  industrious Creek full blood. Eloquent and intense. He was a blacksmith,  and he was a silver craftsman. He was an artist, too. And they used  passive resistance to protest the forceful allotment of the land.    One of  28  them, I think Red Bird Smith, they brought him in in chains to make him  enroll. It said,    According to the Four Mothers Society and to Crazy  Snake, allotment was a violation of the treaties, which is solemnly  guaranteed that the Indian Nation   s title would be perpetual.     What happened in 1909, there had been a theft of some goods. No Snake  had any connection with the affair. I got this, word for word from Angie  Debo   s book.    But the authorities of McIntosh County attempted for no  particular reason to arrest Chitto Harjo.    He didn   t have anything to do  with the theft or anything.    Five deputies proceeded to his home where  seven Indians were assembled. A fight ensued and two deputies were  killed. Chitto Harjo and one of his followers were wounded. The Indians  escaped and were never captured. But four counties were thrown into  turmoil by this Snake uprising.    It said,    The state militia was rushed to  the affected locality and quiet      these are Angie Debo   s words      quiet,  which had never been endangered except by the deputies, was restored.  So this ended the affair so far as the Indians were concerned, but Chitto  Harjo   s fame reached international proportions and headlines that  increased in virulence with distance.    In other words, they got  elaborated on. Then he was this great enemy. I feel so sorry for him.  Like my sister-in-law said,    He looked so sad.    I said,    He was sad  because everything he did was  made to look  wrong.     Grandpa Hill believed in education, though. At one time, he was the  President of the Creek Board of Education. In one of those Real West  magazines   my father loved those stories   he bought, there was  Grandpa Hill. It shows him. We don   t even have a picture of that. But it  was a picture in there and it showed him because he always believed in  education. He was an attorney, too. He was Prosecuting Attorney for  Creek Nation and had a real estate agency. He was a Renaissance man,  is what I called him because he was a Knight. They vilified the Knights  of Templar so much. Grandpa Hill was a Knight of Templar. I was  talking to the Chief Justice of the Creek Nation, he said,    I am a Knight  of Templar, too.    He said,    I   m proud of it.    Actually, in the beginning,  they were named for the ones  the Knights of Templar  that originally  went to the Holy Land to protect the  Christian  pilgrims.  I have a picture of Grandpa Hill in his Knights of Templar uniform. I  should have brought the picture in here, but there is a picture of him  here. He has his sword, and he has all his things. And his watch has the  fob with the Knights of Templar, and it   s gold. It   s a beautiful thing,  which is passed down to the men in the family.  The Knights of Templar were hated by Henry V, they said, because so  many people gave them gifts of jewelry and money and he was jealous  of their things. So, they fled. That   s how they got to Scotland. So,  29  Little Thunder  Hill  Grandpa Hill, his mason certificate has the ancient Scottish rite. It was  signed in Guthrie.  When Dr. Blackburn  of the Oklahoma Historical Society  came over     (I   m going to leave my place, which was Fort Davis during the Civil  War and has the prehistoric Indian mound and our family cemetery here   to the Society ). Anyway, Dr. Blackburn came over, and Dub West, our  local historian, and Richard Ryan, who was with Fort Gibson. They  came over to talk about it, and I showed Dr. Blackburn this certificate of  Grandpa Hill   s. It has all the autographs of the people at the same time  he was taken in, and on there is some of the Nobles  family . He said,     This is the founder of OU.    I said,    I didn   t know that     (Laughter)  I was so glad. A lot of real prominent people back during Grandpa Hill   s  time. Just like Papa, my grandfather  Mother   s father Cheasquah .  During one summer, Red Bird let him go with an older brother on a  cattle drive. He loved it  He wrote back and told them that he was going  to be a cowboy, that   s what his life was. Red Bird got on the train and  went down and got him and brought him home and made him go back to  school. (Laughter)  What is your creative process, starting with how you get your ideas?  A lot of times it   s   well, for instance, we were painting out in Seattle  when we were out there on the San Juan Islands, where they have the  whales and all the Indian culture. It was wonderful. We saw Eskimo  carvings and stuff. Anyway, I was sitting on a clump of rocks and all  this moss. And what puzzles me is why a cold place like that has all  these beautiful wildflowers, poppies and everything. I was sitting there, I  was looking at it and I thought,    This must be like where the Little  People live.    And all this beautiful lichen, and little flowers and things  like that. And I did one of my paintings on the Little People, and it won  a prize. I think it was the Spirit of Oklahoma prize. That was inspired by  looking at a clump of rocks and moss and things.  Others, I   ll read something that makes me want to do it. My Treaty  Series   all my paintings are sweetness and light until you get to the  Treaty Series. Okay. That   s one of the treaty series right there.  (Gestures) The reason is a land developer bulldozed a fence on my  great-grandmother   s allotment that had been in place for over a hundred-something  years. I thought,    I can   t shoot him. I can   t take my father   s  .44 Ruger down and shoot him. (Laughter) I   ve got to do something.    I  couldn   t handle my anger in the two weeks between  that  he was  supposed to meet with my brother and us. So, I thought,    I   ll paint a  painting. I   ll paint a painting about it.    They were talking about all this   about the land run monuments . They got into a quarrel over the title  30  that the Land Run people wanted to put a cowboy, jumping off his horse  saying,    This land is mine.     We had to fight Senator Gorton. Senator Gorton hates Indians. I can say  that because while I was on the Arts and Crafts board as  U.S.   Commissioner, we had all kinds of trouble about him. He wanted to do  away with our budget and everything. I went before the Cherokee  Council and the whole Intertribal Council of the Five Tribes  twice . I  remember when I first got up there  Cherokee Council    I took speech  in college   but it had been so long and I avoid speeches. When I was  talking, I could hear my voice shaking, I was so nervous. But I had gone  to school with John Ketcher  deputy chief of Cherokee Nation  and, of  course, Wilma  Mankiller  was so sweet. And they all signed  resolutions, and I went before the Intertribal Council. Wilma wrote a  letter to President Clinton. I got this wonderful woman,  secretary to the  Intertribal Council . She wasn   t one of the Five Tribes, she was   Comanche . I just loved her. She was so sweet. She worded the  resolution for me and we got all the chiefs to sign it.  I remember, they  U.S. Congress  had already taken our budget away  twice. So, I faxed that to Washington. Meredith Stanton, who was the  director  or the IACB , when she got to the fax machine, she was  running down the hall of the Department of Interior to the secretary   s  office,    Look  Look what I have  Look what I have     (Laughter)  Because the Intertribal Council represented around 600,000 Indians,  altogether. And when they had all of that, do you know they gave our  budget back to us? Even Dr. Coburn, I had called him about it. He had  just got in office, and he called me back and talked to me fifteen  minutes. He voted for it, and he   s not for wasting money on anything.  As a commissioner, it was something that I thought I could do to help  other Indian artists.  Lots of other people helped. My help was a small  part.   No, I didn   t go in until 2000 and the  first Indian art law  came out in  1990. I remember when it did come out, I wanted them to be sure and  put it in there since I was not a tribal member of the Cherokee Nation,  but I have all this ancestry. I wanted them to say they could not  prosecute anybody if they could prove they were Indian, and they did.  They put that in there. They said they won   t touch anybody if they are.  We are supposed to say, for instance, in my case, I have Cherokee  ancestry and like I said, it   s in all the history books. Our family must  have made a lot of noise because they   re in all these history books,  Grandpa Hill and all of them. (Laughter)  Anyway, I didn   t have anything to do with that part of it. But they have  passed about four Indian art laws. I have copies of all of them, and I   ve  31  read every one of them, too. One of them is about that thick (Gestures)  because I wanted to know what they were doing. The first time, they  asked me to be a Commissioner. I said,    I don   t want to do anything  where I have to persecute anybody or prosecute anybody.       No, no, no,  that   s not your job.     Most people don   t know the process. If somebody wants to complain  about somebody   they think they   re not Indian   they have to gather all  this documentation. They have to have proof that they advertise it and  something that shows that they are actually selling work as an Indian  artist. When they get the complaint, they send it to the Arts and Crafts  board, but the Commissioners don   t come into it. It   s turned over to the  Department of the Interior   s attorneys. The attorney looks it over     Commissioners   none of us see any of that. Then it   s turned over if they  think they really  are  doing what they are not supposed to do, violating  the law. It   s turned over to the Department of Justice and they do it.  (Laughs)  Most of the people have been prosecuted, I understand, for jewelry. One  of them was a gallery out in Gallup  New Mexico  where they were  from Iran. They were selling Indian art and they were peddling drugs.  All they did to them was just deport them. It makes me so angry. They  should have done something to them besides deport them. But that   s  what  I was told .  Jewelry is such a lucrative thing. One of the artists that was  on the  board  when I was Commissioner was Jesse Monongye. He does this  gorgeous, gorgeous stuff, and each one is original. It   s just gorgeous.  The Trustees invited us when we had a board meeting out there and the  two founders of Scottsdale   she sat on one side of me and he sat on the  other side of me. Meredith said,    They buy paintings, too      Anyway, she was so sweet, the woman was. She was showing her  bracelet. On the outside and the inside of it, Jesse has told the whole  story of her family, how they got to Scottsdale, and everything they did.  They love everything Indian. They support Indian arts, support Indian  jewelry, pottery and all those things. A lot of people do. But like I said, I  didn   t want to get involved in the Indian art law   I don   t want to  condemn people. Some people, I believe, really are Indian, but they  can   t prove it. Just as an example, now, we have a family member     they   ve got all these pictures, you can tell they were Indian. They were  on the Cherokee Trail of Tears. When they got to Kansas, somewhere up  there, they just stepped off the Trail and quit being Indians. Yet, like I  said, the great-grandmother, you can tell she was an Indian. She looks  like a full blood.  32  Little Thunder  Hill  A lot of people did not sign up because they were afraid of what would  happen to them again. They were afraid. As I told someone one time, I  said,    People who were afraid, I feel sorry for them. But the people who  are ashamed of it, I can   t see that at all.    I remember we had this person,  he was doing a book, and he said that his grandfather hid his  grandmother when she got old because she started to look like an Indian.  My father got up, he walked out of the room, and whenever they came   to our house , he never came back in the room again. I was telling  somebody about that, and they said,    That   s a terrible thing to say to  Indian people.    I said,    Yes, I think it is, too.     I think he  the writer  was just trying to be honest, but I didn   t like it  either way. We were taught to be proud of being Indian. In fact, I have  to say this, when I was going to high school, in our history class,  Oklahoma History, they asked everybody who was part Indian to raise  their hand. Everybody except one person raised their hand. You would  never have known it to look at them or anything. I remember I came  home and I was telling Mother, I said I felt sorry for the one because I  thought people who weren   t Indian were underprivileged in some way  because we had been taught to be proud of it. (Laughter)  I know you   ve had some medical things this year, but what is your  typical creative routine? Do you work in the morning? Do you prefer to  work at night?  I   d say I don   t work by mood, but if I   ve got a deadline or something, if  I force myself to work, it doesn   t flow. Okay, that   s the only word I can  think of. But other times, I want to paint so bad I can   t stand it. This hip  thing is driving me crazy because I want to paint so bad. (Laughter)  Anyway, I   ll get an idea for something, and I   ll just start working with  it. Sometimes I don   t know quite what to do with it, and I   ll set it aside. I  know I did that with one thing. I looked at it every day when I walked  past it, and then one day, (Snaps) just like that, I knew what to do with  it. And it won a prize. So, I keep several things going at once and work  on them like that.  I do a lot of research. All those books, I buy stuff   like the Dawes  Commission   and then, I will base paintings on those. Just like I have to  finish my  painting  Manifest Destiny. It has always hurt that Tulsa has a  school, an elementary school, named Andrew Jackson Elementary  School. Why make a monument to a mass murderer? That   s what he  was, he was a mass murderer. One of the paintings I   m going to do     people are probably not going to like it   I remember Tom Giago in an  article, he was the first one who mentioned it, that Abraham Lincoln had  a mass hanging of over a hundred Indians. In this American Heritage  Book of Indians, John F. Kennedy wrote the foreword to it, and I used  33  Little Thunder  Hill  theirs.    There are thirty-eight Indians,    he says,    He pardoned some of  them, the  thirty-eight  others he hung.    A mass hanging  This is the  great emancipator? He set their souls free? What else?  The whole thing was because they were hungry. The government broke  the treaties just like they always did. Someone said once that the  government never kept a treaty unless it was something they wanted.  Anyway, they were supposed to provide food in return for the Indians  going on the reservation and giving up their land for settlement. They  were starving because the food the government furnished them was full  of maggots, worms. It was rotten. So, they raided a farm, homestead,  one person was killed there. I don   t know how many Indians   they  didn   t say that   and they killed a cow because they were hungry.  Abraham Lincoln was involved in the Civil War   this book says he  didn   t really want to be bothered with it all   so he pardoned about half  of them and hung the rest of them.  I was talking to a friend. He said it   s on the Internet. He said on the  Internet, it   s not as kind to Abraham Lincoln. They said that he thought  it would look bad to the Allies in the Civil War if he didn   t come down  on them real hard. I guess if you could murder thirty-eight people, to me,  that   s heartbreaking. He   s a mass murderer, too.  Of course,  in  the Civil War, as I mentioned, Mother   s family fought for  the Confederacy and Daddy   s fought for the Union. (Laughter) We have  one Yankee buried in our family cemetery. He came here after the war,  and he got sick. Red Bird and Ellen took him into their own home, they  took care of him, and when he died he was the first person in our family  cemetery. His name was Louis Thurman, and they have a gravestone for  him. So, he   s out there. People were kind to each other after the war, but  it was terrible, so devastating. A friend of mine, I just love her, she was  the Curator at the Oklahoma Historical Society, Mary Jane  Warde . She  was the curator for the Indian part of it, and she   s doing a book on the  Civil War. She   d asked me for information about Fort Davis. Everything  you read says that everything that people went through, it was so  terrible. I know that Mother said Ellen Rogers and all of them, they went  down to the Red River, they fled there. Daddy   s   the ones that were  with Opothle Yahola, they went north.  As you look back on your art career, what do you think one of the high  points was?  I   d have to say the Waite Phillips Trophy was. (Laughter) That just  floored me. That   s supposed to be the supreme award, according to  Philbrook, in the Indian art world. At that time, Philbrook was the Indian  art show. I   d say that I won it and that I got it as young as I was. The  34  Little Thunder  Hill   other artists , most of them were of Mother   s and Daddy   s generation. I  was the first one of my generation to get the Waite Phillips Trophy. Of  course, if they   d continued it, they   d have had a lot more. Then they  made me a Master of the Five Tribes Museum.  Yes, and the first Indian woman. Weren   t you, first woman Master?  Yes, I was the first woman and I   m the only one still living of the  original ones. (Laughter) Don   t know whether that   s a big deal or not.  It   s little things. Oh, I want to tell this. After I made the quavering  speech before the Intertribal Council when I was wanting them to give  the budget back to us, several of the women who were the craftspeople  came over to me and said,    We want to thank you for standing up for  our people.    It was so sweet and so wonderful. That   s one of the  supreme things. And the other one   I took care of Mother and Daddy,  both of them, in their final illnesses. They were two, twenty-four-hour  invalid patients. I don   t know how I was able to be at the hospital or  home at the same time, but I   d have maybe fifteen minutes of sleep. But  after Mother and Daddy died, I remember our family doctor stood there  for a long time and then finally, he said,    Most people don   t get that  kind of care.     I would take Mother to the doctor. I   d roll up her hair for her and we   d  wash it. I   d stand behind her in the tub, wash her hair, I   d roll her hair  up, and I   d put a ribbon on her and put lipstick on her and dress her up  just like a doll, I guess. (Laughs) Like I said, they took care of us when  we were children. We owe it to them. I grew up in two families that  always took care of their elderly. I feel like that was the supreme  moment in my life when he said that most people don   t get that kind of  care.  And then, of course, the other awards, I   ve gotten a lot of awards out of  Scottsdale. I   d just had a gallbladder operation, and I got the letter that I  had won the grand prize at Scottsdale and five other awards. So Mother  told my doctor about it and he said,    Well, you   ve got to go.    I went at  the end of it, but not the first.    But you can   t drive,    he said. So, Daddy  drove out there. Every bump the car hit, I could feel it. (Laughter) But  that was really nice. That was one of the high points, too.  And being made a commissioner, a U.S. Commissioner. I wonder what  my ancestors would think about that because here I was equal to Henry  Dawes. He was a U.S. Commissioner, wasn   t he? (Laughter) He was a  Senator, too, though. So, I don   t know. Red Bird was against allotting  the land.  Back  then, his property went clear down to Three Forks and  Ellen   s was on the Creek side. He was on the Cherokee side, she was on  the Creek side. I have a map that shows all of this that they had done at  35  Little Thunder  Fort Smith on some kind of fabric. It shows Red Bird Harris   s holdings.  Our family is so deep into Indian everything, lore and history. Like I  said, coming up, we didn   t hear about it. But when I got interested in  Indian art, then I found all this treasure trove of stuff. I wish I   d had a  recorder back then because in the evenings, we   d walk up and sit on the  front porch with Papa, Mother   s father, and that   s when he   d tell us all  these stories about Indian Territory. I   ve painted those stories, too. This  one. (Gestures) Like the outlaws consulting with them, and the different  things they did. Grandpa Hill actually helped build, as a mason, the Five  Tribes  Museum , physically helped. I know I   m forgetting something,  but there have been far more high points than low points, let   s put it that  way.  Milly Francis, I would like to mention Milly Francis. They have two  monuments to her in Muskogee today because when they were removed  from the Southeast, I found out afterwards, her allotment   it wasn   t  allotted in those days because you lived in tribal land and you could  have as much as you could farm   was right down at the spring, which  was in my great-grandmother   s allotment, much, much later in 1908 or  something like that. That was the Milly Francis settlement. We didn   t  know that.  I remember Daddy said at the time we were going to try to find her  grave. Lola Shropshire, she   s a good friend, she   s a writer, one of my  writer friends. We went everywhere trying to find where they said the  grave was. Then I remembered that the Jobe sisters, who were the  children of my grandfather   s ranching partner, they have an old family  cemetery like we have, close to the river. They said their father said  that   s where Milly Francis   s grave was. So, Lola and I went down there,  and we spent two days cleaning all the saplings and the locusts and  everything off of it and revealed all the rocks around the side.  A good friend of mine, Yvonne Litchfield, with the Tulsa World, she got  interested in me when I did the Milly Francis  painting , the one for the  Bicentennial. Every once in a while, she   d do a story on me, which was  real sweet of her. Anyway, they came over and they took the pictures.  But we never told  others  where we located it because there have been a  lot of graves that have been robbed like that. She   s the only woman who  has ever been awarded   I   ll tell what she did here. Major General Ethan  Allen Hitchcock told the story about Milly. It   s in one of Grant  Foreman   s  books . She had saved a young Georgia militia man   s life     I was wondering if we should look at the painting a little bit while you  tell this story.  36  Hill  Dick West told me one time when I was doing pastel portraits,    You  need somebody to take your painting away before you overwork it.     (Laughter) So, maybe it   s a good thing that I put it in  the competition   before. And that won a prize   they bought it for the museum. But,  anyway, Milly, when she was about sixteen years old, according to all of  this, she was a very beautiful girl and everybody petted her. She was  their pet. Her father, Francis the Prophet   they were Creek, they weren   t  Seminole   but this was during the Seminole War, so they had captured  a young Georgia militia man, and they were going to put him to death.  On the Florida thing, I worked with the DAR  Daughters of the  American Revolution . They got all the information  but  in this, they  said they were preparing to burn him at the stake, which wasn   t true.   Milly  told Colonel Hitchcock all this  in Oklahoma . He had always  heard this story, so when he came here to investigate frauds on the  Indians, to see they weren   t getting meat that was rotten, I guess. He  looked her up. She was about forty-five then. He said she was still a  beautiful woman, but she was dying of consumption and destitute. When  he went back to Congress, he told her story, and Congress was so moved  by it that they voted her a pension and a medal. It is a Congressional  Medal, but it   s not the Congressional Medal  of Honor .  Here it is. (Reading)    She is one of the few woman in history that had  bestowed on them a medal and a pension, authorized by a special act of  the United States Congress.    That was in June, 1844. They granted to  her an annual pension. But she died before she got anything from that.  Her children went back to Florida after she died. I think she had two  surviving children out of eight. But the young man that she saved, they  sold him to the Spaniards for a barrel of whiskey, they said. (Laughs)  They freed him, and so when the war was over, he came back and he  offered to marry her. She told him that she didn   t save him to marry him.  She married a Creek of her own race and everything.  I don   t know, it was her compassion because she argued that he was  young and   first of all, he wasn   t guilty. That was the main thing.  (Laughs) They had caught him fishing in the Apalachicola River. They  took all his clothes off of him. And I painted  that . He   s bending  forward, so it   s modest   people can   t complain. And he   s bound. It has  two warriors, one on each side of him. It shows  Milly  standing by her  father. Her father was a chief during that war. So, when she wanted him  to spare his life, he said,    Go to the warriors who captured him and ask  for his life.     The warriors had had two sisters killed during that war.   She did and they spared his life. They bought that for the Sequoyah   Institute , the one they have down at Little Rock. They bought that  painting that was in the last show out here.  37  Little Thunder  Hill  I   ve done four paintings about her. The first was commissioned by     well, it was commissioned by the United States government  That   s a  high point I forgot to say  It went all over to all the military bases  overseas. It traveled, and now it   s at that fort in Washington, D.C.,  which is just across the Potomac. Solomon  McCombs  got one of the  commissions and Fred  Beaver  got one of them. I can   t remember some  of the others, but they only chose thirteen for the first thirteen states. As  far as I know, I   m the only woman, but anyway, there were thirteen of us  for the original thirteen colonies.  Francis the Prophet, I   d painted that earlier because he was taken     I want to be sure and tell about that mass murderer, Andrew Jackson,   who  took him under a flag of truce and hung him. I painted him as he  was described. This is described in one of those books.  They described his clothes and the gifts and tomahawk and the other  things that were given to him by the Prince Regent of England. They  took him with them, and they did all these honors. He came to a ball  aboard a Russian frigate in London and this is the way he went. The  most splendid suit and everything. What is sad about that is, Andrew  Jackson, to add to all his other crimes, took him under a flag of truce, a  big no-no in all ethics, and hung him. So, after that, they were destitute.  Before the war,  some Creeks  were wealthy, had plantations and  everything. They could afford everything wealthy people had back then,  a beautiful plantation home. That   s why  Milly  happened to come with  the McIntosh party to Indian Territory  when they lost everything .  (Focusing on another painting). This one is water-media? Mixed media  on board?  This is gouache. That   s white added to tempera. But this is a watercolor.  I used Windsor Newton, a real good paint, on paper. D   Arches 300-  pound water color paper. (Gestures to Francis the Prophet) That   s an oil  on canvas over there. I did them in way different periods because  Francis the Prophet was one of the original paintings that they started  the Five Tribes Museum  with . I gave it to them. They exhibited it a lot,  so then I gave it to them. I always just loved them because they   re into  history. But I didn   t know as much about Milly until, when they  U.S.  government/Captain McNaughten  did the commission, they gave me a  list of things that you could paint. Most of them were heroic acts, like  one of the Indians wiping out a whole machine gun nest, and I thought,     I don   t want to paint that. I want something pretty to paint.     I was talking to Rennard Strickland, and he said,    Why don   t you do the  Milly Francis story?    And I said,    That   s a good idea  I can do  something pretty.    And it   s a good story, too. It   s a nice story because it  38  Little Thunder  Hill  showed the Indians were more humanitarian than Andrew Jackson. But  you know one of the things they said they like Andrew Jackson for?  Because he was one of the people. He and his cronies would sit around  the pot bellied stove in the White House and spit tobacco juice on it.  That   s their hero  That   s the one they named the elementary school after,  the mass murderer.  On this  painting  of Chitto Harjo and his men, you talked about the  sadness on his face. Talk a little bit about the composition of this  because I think you made some great choices.  Like I said, the negative space is just as important as the positive space.  A lot of it is suggested by the way the color forms on it. I remember  someone said the best watercolors that were ever painted were purely  accidental. You get all these great washes and everything. I see a lot of  things there, I guess, that other people don   t see. I   ll paint something like  the oil painting I did  one  time where you splash it with the paint and  everything. Now, Francis the Prophet, I set out and did exactly what I  wanted to do. That was not done with flight of fancy. I tried to make it  as authentic as I could because they explained it  as him wearing  his  most splendid suit of red and gold. Of course, they all wear the feathers.  I did the feathers, too.  It was such a different time. At the time, he was so honored. And then  afterwards when everybody decided they wanted their land    I  remember that I was talking to someone and I said,    There   s so much  sympathy for the slaves, as there should be, but there   s no sympathy for  Indians at all when they got into all this mess.    I wrote a letter to the  editor  of the Muskogee Phoenix , first one I ever wrote, because the so  called perks are the results of the treaties that the Indians negotiated with  the  government . I said,    A treaty is a legal contract between nations of  equal importance, supposedly.    They made these treaties and then when  they got tired of them, or it wasn   t convenient, they simply abrogated  these treaties, and then they took them away.  When I was talking to this reporter about that, I said,    They   re so  unsympathetic. Why is it people are not more sympathetic to Indians?     He said,    Because they perceive the American Indian as getting  something somebody else doesn   t. He gets all these perks.    I stopped  him for a minute and I said,    Well, let   s put it this way. The slaves were  important because they needed their labor. They kept them alive, they  fed them, they clothed them, housed them. Of course, that wasn   t always  good. But the Native American was no good to anybody until he was  dead, because the sooner they killed him, the sooner they got his land.     He said,    Well, that   s a point.    (Laughs)  39  Little Thunder  Hill  I   m glad to hear you use your voice to speak out. I really appreciate this  interview.  When I get this hip back in, I   ll be better off. (Getting paper to read)  This was part of a thing that I did where they asked me to make a  statement when I judged the show out there. They asked me to make a  statement when I judged the competitive show or the student show,  because I   ve judged both. Anyway, I said, (Reading),    The spirit of a  culture is revealed through the artistic expression of its people.    Then I  went on to say,    It is by passing on traditions and values.    They were  forcefully removed, of course, to Indian Territory from their ancestral  homelands. There was another thing I said, too.     Art widens the scope  of the inner and outer senses and enriches life by giving us a greater  awareness of the world , and it makes you notice things. You see things  that you ordinarily wouldn   t notice before.     Right now, I   m conquering horses    feet and legs. (Laughter) I   ve noticed  a lot of the artists when they do horses, they hide them  feet  in the grass  or the dirt or the water, and I decided I   m not going to do that.  (Laughter) I   m going to do it like you   re supposed to.  There are so many things in a lifetime. Someone asked me one time,     Where do you get your ideas from? Are you afraid you   ll run out of  ideas?    I couldn   t run out of ideas if I lived to be two hundred because  there   s so much to do. (Laughter) Like the place here, when I get it back  into shape again. The mound is so interesting, too, because nobody  knows what was there. The story was that Red Bird was going to put a  cellar in there, way, way back then, and he went out and started digging.  That night, he had a dream and Stand Waite says,    Bird, let my bones  rest in peace.     Now, Stand Waite   s not buried there, but in his dream   see, Stand  Waite was a commander  in the Civil War in Indian Territory . That   s  why  Red Bird  went out and covered it up the next day. There   s never  been any excavation. People want to dig it up. In fact, they want to dig  up my great-grandfather. (Laughs) I   ve had people call me. One of them  said,    Wasn   t your grandfather a confederate soldier?    I said,    No, my  grandfather was not a confederate soldier.     My great-grandfather was, but I didn   t tell him that. I was telling the  truth. Later on, someone was asking,    Do you think he   d have been  buried with a belt buckle?    They get  10,000 dollars for a Confederate  belt buckle on the Internet  I told them,    He was seventy-two when he  died, and I doubt, seriously, that he would have hung on to a belt buckle  and been buried with it.     40  Little Thunder  He was a forward, progressive person as an attorney. All of them were,  all my family. I was lucky that I got some of their genes that believe in  being progressive. You have to live in the world that you   re born in. I  can live in the past through my paintings, but in real life, I face whatever  has to be faced.  Well, thank you so much, Joan, this has been wonderful.  -------  -------
