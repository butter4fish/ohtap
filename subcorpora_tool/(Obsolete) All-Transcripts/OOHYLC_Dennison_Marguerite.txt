This is part  of our Oklahoma One Hundred Year Life project, so thank you for  having us today.  Dennison You   re welcome.  Finchum Let   s start with having you tell us when and where you were born.  Dennison I was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on May 2, 1915.  Finchum Were you born in a hospital or at home?  Dennison No, I was born at home. In fact, my mother was a Christian Scientist.  You know what that is? She didn   t even have a doctor. I was born  without a doctor.  Finchum Did you have brothers and sisters?  Dennison Yes, I had a lot of brothers and sisters.  Finchum Where were you in the order? What number where you?  Dennison I was next to the baby.  Finchum Okay. How many older?  Dennison Well, I had, let   s see. I had so     Finchum That   s okay.  5  Dennison I had three sets of us children. My mother married first, and she had  three boys and a daughter by her first husband. Then, they divorced.  Then, she married my dad. Then, she had four girls and three boys.  Then after that, my dad he remarried again, and he had two girls and  two boys. I had a big, you know.  Finchum Quite a few to keep up with.  Dennison Yeah. They   re all deceased, but I have one brother that   s about twenty  years younger than me. I have a sister that   s eighty-four.  Finchum Are you the first one to make it to one hundred?  Dennison Only one in my whole family that I ever did know to make it to a  hundred.  Finchum Have any idea why?  Dennison No. I just told Lauren this morning I didn   t know why God was leaving  me here, but I guess he   s got a plan.  Finchum I   d say so. What did your parents do for a living?  Dennison My dad was a rancher. My mother was an Osage Indian, and she had  her allotment. They had a ranch from her allotment.  Finchum In Tulsa County?  Dennison In Osage County, just west of Tulsa.  Finchum Okay. Raised cattle?  Dennison Yes.  Finchum Can you describe the house that you grew up in?  Dennison Well, the ranch house burned down when I was a little girl, but our  home in town, it was there until not too many years ago. It was 1164  North Main. It was a two-story house, a big white two-story house.  Finchum So you had time in town and time out on the farm?  Dennison We had two. We had a home out on the ranch and a home in town, too.  Finchum Which did you like better?  6  Dennison I   m sorry?  Finchum Which one did you like better?  Dennison Well, I was in town more than I was out.  Finchum Okay.  Dennison But when my mother and dad separated, my mother took us children  and we moved to California. While we was in California, her ranch  house burned down. What?  Finchum Company coming in, and they went around the other way.  Dennison Oh, I thought she was motioning to me. We lived out there until 1927.  Then, that   s about when the Depression started. My mama was smart  enough to get us, to get us all back to Oklahoma. Well, then she built  her another house on a ranch which wasn   t nothing like her big ranch  house, but that   s where I lived until I was married.  Finchum So you were in California when you were around ten, eleven years old?  Dennison Yes, yes.  Finchum So you started school out there?  Dennison I was about twelve years old when we moved back to Oklahoma.  Finchum So you started elementary school in California?  Dennison Catholic school.  Finchum Catholic, okay.  Dennison Went to Catholic school. Yes.  Harmon Mama, tell them about the movie studio.  Dennison Oh no, I don   t. My mother, she brought an interest in a movie studio out  in California. I don   t know much about that. She knows more about that  than I do.  Finchum What was your mother   s name?  7  Dennison Minnie A. Carter Pease. Carter was her first married name, and we  always remember that on account of our brothers and sisters were  Carters. Then she married my dad, which was George W. Pease.  Finchum P-E     Dennison P-E-A-S-E.  Finchum    S-E. Okay. That was your maiden name, Pease.  Dennison Pease, yes.  Finchum What did they do when they were in California?  Dennison When we went to California? Well back then, nobody you   re familiar  with but the Indians had a lot of money when they first struck oil. My  mother had quite a bit of money you know, and that   s how we went.  Finchum Did she have a job out there?  Dennison She did in the studio. Yeah.  Finchum Okay.  Dennison She had an interest in.  Finchum When she moved back, did she sell that?  Dennison Yeah, when she moved back, it was a rough time from then on out you  know, during the Depression.  Finchum Well, would you have chores out on the ranch?  Dennison Yes.  Finchum What would you have to do?  Dennison Just like feed the chickens and you know stuff like that, help with the  garden and that kind of stuff.  Finchum When you came back and went to school, where did you go?  Dennison Monte Cassino. In fact my class was   Monte Cassino was brand new  and my eighth grade class was the first one to graduate out of Monte  Cassino.  8  Finchum Did you go onto high school?  Dennison I didn   t finish high school.  Finchum What was your favorite subject?  Dennison My favorite subject was English. I liked English real well.  Finchum You finished the eighth grade     Dennison No, I finished the tenth grade     Finchum Finished the tenth.  Dennison     but not at Monte Cassino. I went to Turley  School, renamed  Cherokee around 1934  after I graduated out of Monte Cassino. See the  times got so hard my mother couldn   t afford to keep me in Monte  Cassino because it was expensive, you know. It was a boarding school.  Finchum What was that like?  Dennison I liked it. I liked all of the nuns. I liked the strict stuff you know. They  were strict. You had to have table manners and you had to have certain  things that you had to do. I liked every bit of that.  Bishop What order of the nuns, what order were they from?  Dennison I   m sorry.  Bishop What order were the nuns?  Finchum What order were the nuns?  Dennison You know, well they wore those black habits. I can   t, isn   t that awful, I  can   t remember. I   ve even got pictures of some of them.  Harmon It   s been over eighty or ninety years ago.  Dennison Sisters of  St. Joseph, Benedictine  I believe. I won   t swear to that.  (Laughter) I loved the nuns. A lot of them didn   t. They were strict. You  was taught manners. When you went to the table to eat, you all set  down at the table. Nobody got up and left until everybody was finished  then they excused their self. I loved all that. Most people don   t. That   s  the reason it   s hard for me today. They don   t discipline their children.  No, they run and they grab the first place at the table and set down. It   s  just different to me. (Laughter) I loved it.  9  Finchum How would they discipline?  Dennison You mean the sisters?  Finchum Uh-huh.  Dennison Really I don   t know because I never did have to be. (Laughter) I liked  it.  Finchum You lived there during the school year?  Dennison I lived there through the week, and then on the weekend we would get  to go home. Then, we would go back through the week.  Finchum Well, would you have things that you had to do there, like a chore or  two, at school?  Dennison We had to take care of our own room, keep it clean. They had chores  you had to do, but I still liked it. (Laughter) If I   d had the money I   d  have sent all of my children to Catholic school.  Finchum Well, were some of your brothers and sisters there with you?  Dennison My sister.  Finchum Okay. So you weren   t alone?  Dennison No, my younger sister.  Finchum How did you get back and forth on the weekends?  Dennison One of my brothers would come and get us. They had a car and they  would come and get us. Then, take us back.  Finchum Well, how did you do holidays back then?  Dennison Well, holidays we got off. We could go home on the holiday.  Finchum Okay, and at Christmas at your house, what would go on?  Dennison What was it like?  Finchum Uh-huh.  10  Dennison About like Christmas now, a big Christmas tree, presents and stuff like  that. Of course we had a big family so there was a big crowd. (Laughs)  Finchum What would your mother cook?  Dennison She cooked everything. We always had a big Sunday dinner every  Sunday.  Finchum After church?  Dennison Yeah. We always had, yeah. I did that all through when I was raising  my family. My grandkids right today know that. They still come here to  eat on Sunday.  Harmon Mama tell them about the plate that Grandma always set.  Dennison My mama was real religious. She always set an extra plate for Jesus at  the table.  Finchum That   s nice.  Dennison Yeah. She always set an extra plate.  Finchum Her parents, how did they come to be in Oklahoma? Your  grandparents     Dennison Her dad was from Pennsylvania. He was a full blood Irishman, and I  guess you know whenever they started coming back West, he come  back to Oklahoma. He met my grandma, who was Indian. I guess that   s  the way they got     Harmon He was a doctor.  Dennison    together. He was one of the first doctors in Osage County.  Finchum Okay.  Dennison Yeah.  Finchum Had a little bit of money through the years then.  Dennison Yeah. Yeah.  Finchum Pretty good life.  11  Dennison My family always had money until that Depression hit. Nobody had  money then.  Finchum Well once you finished the tenth grade, what did you do?  Dennison I went to Draughn   s Business College for two years after that. Then,  after that, I got married and had my family. I worked the whole time I  was married. I worked at Douglas during the war. I worked at Spartan. I  worked at the First National Bank for eight years and run the elevator at  night for eight years, so I worked.  Finchum Sounds like it.  Dennison I had to. I had a family. You know, you had to work to feed them.  Finchum What did you do during the war for Douglas?  Dennison I was Rosie the Riveter there. (Laughs) At Spartan I was an inspector,  but the funny thing about being an inspector was my brother was a  guard. He said,    If you   re bound and determined you   re going to work,  I   m going to get you an easier job.    Well, he got me a job as an  inspector out in the machine shop, which I knew nothing about it,  nothing. I thought,    How am I going to handle this?    You know what I  did? I was just honest with those men. I said,    I don   t know one   I  don   t even know what I   m doing out here. I don   t know one thing about  it.    They all took a liking to me and said,    Don   t worry. We   ll tell you  when not to put your stamp on something.    They did. They helped me  through that. I had a lot of good friends. Made a lot of good friends that  way. I didn   t know one thing about being a machine shop inspector.  (Laughs) Nothing, but back then you know, they had to have people and  they just hired people.  Finchum Well, were you the only female inspector?  Dennison Yeah, I was in that department.  Finchum That must have been a little rough.  Dennison I made it but I made friends too. I was smart enough to do that. I knew I  couldn   t   I thought,    You can   t go out there and try to boss those men  and tell them what you don   t even know anything about at all,    so I  didn   t. That   s the way I made it.  Finchum Well, when you were a Rosie what did you do? What was your job?  Dennison A Rosie?  12  Finchum Uh-huh.  Dennison Riveting the airplane, with the rivet.  Finchum You actually did the riveting?  Dennison Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Finchum You are a true Rosie then?  Dennison Yeah.  Finchum That   s pretty cool   Dennison Yeah.  Finchum What was your husband doing?  Dennison My husband? He worked at Douglas.  Finchum Okay.  Dennison Yeah, then after the war, he worked for the city of Tulsa for twenty-two  years.  Finchum How did you meet him?  Dennison Well, somebody asked me that. I said,    I don   t know. He was just  there.    That   s about the only way I know to    (Laughter)  Harmon I asked you why you ever went out with him.  Dennison Huh? Do what?  Harmon I asked you why you ever went out with Daddy.  Dennison Yeah. I don   t know. It   s been too many years ago. (Laughter) That   s  been too many years ago.  Finchum And what was his name?  Dennison His name was Charles Dennison.  Finchum What year did you get married?  13  Dennison We got married in    35. I had my first daughter in 1936.  Finchum How many children?  Dennison I had four children, and I lost that girl in that picture over there when  she was forty-nine with cancer. I had one boy and three girls.  Finchum Okay.  Dennison I   ve got sixteen grandchildren. I couldn   t tell you how many great-grandchildren,  and even great-great grandchildren. I bet I   ve got     Harmon Almost over a hundred and fifty.  Dennison Almost twenty great-great grandchildren.  Harmon Probably. Yeah. We did a spreadsheet. It   s grown. (Laughter) It   s  grown in about six months.  Dennison About a year ago, my grandson helped me count them up. That was 147  back then, and we   ve had a bunch since then. I really couldn   t tell you  how many.  Finchum Sundays the house is full, huh?  Dennison Yeah.  Finchum Well, did you work up until retirement?  Dennison No, my mother-in-law got sick, and they couldn   t get anybody to take  care of her, so I quit my job and took care of her until she died.  Finchum Was that in Cleveland?  Dennison No, that was in Tulsa.  Finchum When did you come to Cleveland?  Dennison We come to Cleveland in 1970 after my husband retired.  Finchum Why Cleveland?  Dennison Well, my oldest daughter and her husband moved up here. My husband  was retiring. The kids thought we ought to be close to some of them, so  we just moved up here to be close to some of them. I   ve lived here ever  since.  14  Finchum Forty some years then.  Dennison I lived out on the lake. I had a nice home on the lake, but I was in the  tornado in, what year was that? Ninety-one?  Harmon Ninety-one wasn   t it? Was it    91? I think so. Ninety-one.  Dennison So, my sister and I had a duplex together out there. We decided we was  too old to build back, so we moved here and were lucky enough to find  these two houses next door to one another. She lived to be ninety-three.  She   s been gone fifteen years. I took care of her too.  Finchum Were you caught in the tornado? Were you there when it hit?  Dennison I just went over and told my sister, I said   that   s when Jim Giles  (meteorologist) come on with that   what do you call that thing that  they tell you what town   s it   s going to hit?  First Warning  I went over  and I told her,    We better go to the basement or the cellar.    She  wouldn   t go. I went back a second time and I said,    We better go to that  cellar.    I made her get up and go. My house was built up. There was a  big deck right outside my door. We had to go down that deck to get in  that cellar. We just got down in that cellar and that deck was the first  thing that went. Most of our houses was all glass on the lake. We would  have been killed if we   d have stayed up there.  Finchum Well, I   m glad she listened to you that time.  Dennison So am I. Soon as it was over, I didn   t think. I got up and went out.  When up and crossed over the limbs and stuff and our neighbor man, he  come up there. My sister hollered and told me to bring her some dry  shoes. So I went back down to take her some dry shoes, and he hollered  down there. He said,    You girls stay down there. Don   t you come out of  that cellar.    I said,    I   ve already been out there once.    (Laughter) He  said,    There was electric wires all over everywhere.    That   s how come  I   m here. I   ve lived here thirty-some years.  Finchum Nice to have a sister that was that close to you.  Dennison Yeah. She was seven years older than me.  Harmon They bought houses right next door.  Finchum That   s neat I think. What would you do for fun?  Dennison For fun?  15  Finchum Uh-huh.  Dennison Well, we used to just, I don   t know, go to the movies. When I was  younger, I used to go dancing and stuff like that. I didn   t care nothing  about it, but my husband was an excellent dancer. He loved it. I didn   t  care nothing about it. We all got together. We were a real close family.  All my brothers and sisters, we   d go to dances together. We always  celebrated Christmas, New Years, and Thanksgiving and all that  together. That was a tradition in our family for years.  Bishop Where would you go dancing?  Finchum Where would you go dancing?  Dennison Back then it was called the Blue Moon down at Tulsa, and Cain   s   Ballroom . You   ve heard of Cain   s?  Finchum I   ve heard of Cain   s.  Dennison You heard of Bob Wills  and the Texas Playboys ? And Leon  McAuliffe?  Finchum Yes.  Dennison Well, okay.

Finchum What sort of things do you do during the day?  Dennison Oh, not much of anything really.  Finchum Do any reading?  Dennison My eyes have got so bad I can   t read very long at a time. Sometimes I  watch a little TV, but I   m not much of a TV fan in the daytime. I like it  at night, but not daytime.  Finchum You have a lot of company coming in to keep you busy during the day.

Dennison How?  Bishop How important was religion?  Dennison Religion? Well it was important to us. I don   t know, you know, about  anybody else. My mother was a real, real devout Christian.  Harmon Studied the bible.  Finchum But not Catholic?  Dennison She was raised a Catholic. Then, after she got a divorce she had to leave  the church. Before she died, she had us call a priest in. We did, we  called a priest in. He asked if she divorced. She always sent us kids to  Catholic schools. She always had her own Sunday school class with her  grandkids. She   d have her own Sunday school class with her grandkids.  I can   t ever remember a day that my mama didn   t have a study time to  study her bible. Every day she studied her bible, every day. I don   t ever  remember her ever missing. I   m not that good, but she was. (Laughter)  20  Finchum I don   t know if they are disagreeing or agreeing.  Harmon We are just laughing. She   s funny. Well, my mama has great faith, but  she   s not the bible reader like my grandmother.  Dennison I   m not as good a person as Grandma.  Harmon That   s not to say she doesn   t ever read it, just not every day.  Finchum That better? You want to put your feet up more?  Dennison Is that okay?  Finchum Yeah, that   s fine.

Dennison Seventy-nine. My dad had cancer. My mother had, she hemorrhaged  from her mouth. I don   t know. I guess something ruptured. She had  been sick in the bed and my sister and I was taking care of her. I told  my sister,    I think I   ll go in there and check on Mama.    When I went in  there, she   d started hemorrhaging from her mouth and she wouldn   t let  me   I wanted to get a wet rag. She wouldn   t let me do it. She said,     No, don   t. Don   t bother,    you know. We called an ambulance and took  her to the hospital. She died in just a few hours after that. She  hemorrhaged to death. Must have been some kind of blood disease or  something, because back then they didn   t know about stuff.  Finchum No, they didn   t.  Bishop Having some Osage as the background, have you continued any  traditions, any Osage traditions, as you   ve aged across time?  Dennison Do what?  Bishop Have you continued any type of Osage type of traditions in your family?  Dennison Not really, because we was never raised up there around the Osages.  We was raised down closer to Tulsa in that part of Osage County.  Harmon But tell them Mama, you   ve always been involved.  Dennison Huh?  Harmon You   ve always been involved with the tribe though.  Dennison Do what?  Harmon You   ve always been involved with the tribe.  Dennison Well, yeah. You know     Harmon Part of it. We grew up with part of it, the dance...  Dennison Yeah. Now I have nephews that dance. They   re dancers. They have  those costumes and all that stuff. In fact, go in there and get their  picture and show them, but I never did do that. I used to go to dances  and stuff. I never did. I don   t know how come the Osages wanted to  honor me. I had no idea. I still don   t. Mystery to me.  22  That   s my great nephew. (Gestures to photograph)  Harmon He called Mama and wanted to know what color shirt she wanted him  to wear.  Bishop Purple.  Finchum Purple.  Dennison Yeah, they called and asked me what color I wanted them to wear.  Harmon In fact the Gray Horse dances are on right now.  Dennison Have you ever been to an Indian dance?  Bishop I never have.  Dennison You need to go sometime. It   s a sight to see. It really is.  Bishop I   ve heard they   re pretty colorful.  Finchum Could your mother speak the language?  Dennison No. My grandma did. My grandma was an interpreter for the Osage,  French, and the white people.  Finchum What was her name?  Dennison Her name was Adeline Bowers.  Finchum B-O-W-E-R-S?  Dennison Yes.  Harmon Her married name was Kennedy. Mama didn   t tell you that a while ago.  Dennison She interpreted for the Osages, the French, and the white people.  Finchum How did she learn French?  Dennison She was an orphan. Her mama died when she was born. Her dad took  her to the Catholic convert and they raised her. They raised my  grandma. I guess she learned there at the convert.  Finchum Pretty smart to know all three.  23  Dennison Yeah. She was a pretty smart old woman.  Harmon She was very knowledgeable of the customs. I have an article. That   s  how I know that. That   s what   s nice about this.  Finchum She said you were familiar with the customs.  Harmon No, my grandmother.  Finchum Oh, your grandmother.  Harmon My grandmother was. Her great-grandmother.  Finchum I guess they had home remedies.  Dennison I guess so. They had to have, I guess.  Finchum Well, growing up, who would discipline the children? Your mother or  your dad?  Dennison My dad. Mama did too, but my dad was strict. He was a full-blooded  Englishman. I mean, that   s probably the reason I liked the strictness in  the convent. When we went to the table, we didn   t talk. He said,    You  go to the table to eat.    Each one had their own place, and you didn   t get  up and leave the table without being excused. He was strict.  Harmon Mama, tell her about when you were little what you did.  Dennison When I was little, I was about three years older than my baby sister. He  had me on one side and he had her on the other side. She was crying  and cutting up. He was getting on her. I looked over at him and I said,     Just cuss her. Just cuss her.    You know I didn   t know that for years,  and there was a county assessor come to Tulsa assessing our house. He  seen my name was Pease, and he asked about my family and he said,    I  know which on you are. You   re the little black-headed and black-eyed  one that told your dad to cuss your little sister.    I never did know that.  (Laughter) Years and years after that that man remembered that. He was  strict.  Finchum Well, if you did something wrong, how would he punish you?  Dennison He   d spank us.  Finchum With what?  24  Dennison Just with     Finchum With his hand?  Dennison Yeah. It seemed like the other kids thought he let me get by with more  than he did the rest of them. I don   t know whether he did or not.  Finchum They thought you were the favorite, huh?  Dennison I might have been. I don   t know. (Laughs)  Finchum You may have not tested his patience as much.  Dennison Maybe not.  Harmon Mom has some funny stories. Tell them about the bathtub and your  bath.  Dennison Oh, when Mama first had the house when we moved from California, it  wasn   t long before she had to have a cistern drilled and had to get a  windmill, and all that. We lived, we had to use coal oil lights and stuff.  There was a cistern up around the hill quite a ways from where we  lived. Every day, I would go take my two buckets for water and go get  my bath water and bring it back. We had a bathtub in our house. Just  didn   t have the water. I   d heat my water and take my bath, and my  brothers would say,    We get to bathe in her water next. We know she   s  not dirty.    (Laughter) They used to tease me because they   d say,    You  bathe so much that you   re going to wash that brown skin off,    you  know, because every day I would do that. I   d go get my two buckets of  water. Come back and heat them. Take my bath.  Finchum They didn   t want to go do that?  Dennison They didn   t want to do that, so they knew I wasn   t very dirty. They just  used my water.  Harmon Tell them about Uncle George when you went to the dance to the  neighbors, with the neighbors.  Dennison Oh, no. I went to a weenie roast.  Harmon A weenie roast, okay.  Dennison Well, my brothers, after my mom and dad separated, my older brothers  were pretty strict on us girls, you know. So we all went to a weenie  roast not very far from our house. Well, I rode over with one bunch of  25  kids, and then I rode back with another bunch, just neighbor kids. My  oldest brother beat me home and told my other brother that I rode in this  other car. Well, we had to stop to open the gate and when they stopped  to open the gate I happened to be setting right here. (Gestures) My  brother opened that door and dragged me out of there. Whipped me  right on the bottom right in front of all my friends, because I came  home in a different car. We was brought up pretty strict.  Finchum I   m not sure how I would react to that    I think I would be fussing at  him. As long as you got home.  Dennison Yeah, I know. It was just neighbors, just young neighbor kids.  Finchum Well, did the ranch have a pond?  Dennison Yeah. There was a pond. It was a real nice ranch.  Finchum Would you go swimming?  Dennison Yeah. We used to go swimming in an old pond. I wouldn   t do that now  for nothing. (Laughs)  Bishop You used to go fishing quite a bit?  Dennison Yeah.  Bishop You say you like to fish with your husband, but did you fish as a child?  Dennison Yeah. Then, my brother just older than me, we used to, they had those  culverts. You know what a culvert is?  Bishop Uh-huh.  Dennison He would get at one end and I would get at the other. We would have a  gunny sack, and we would chase rabbits and catch those rabbits in that  gunny sack.  Finchum Would you have them for dinner?  Dennison No, I can   t remember that. We used to do that for fun, you know.  Finchum I   d be afraid I   d get a skunk.  Dennison Yeah. (Laughs)  Bishop Well, did you ever think you would make it to a hundred?  26  Dennison No. I really never did even think about it really. You just go through  life. You   re just thankful. I   ll go when God wants me to. Every day that  he don   t want me, maybe the devil does. I don   t know. (Laughter)  Finchum How did you celebrate?  Dennison The kids had me a party here at the house and there was how many?  Harmon A hundred and eighty-six people.  Finchum Wow.  Dennison We was going to have it at the church. Going to have a big party and  then I hurt my leg and I couldn   t, so they had it here. So I told the kids  just serve cake and punch. That   s what they served.  Finchum Did you have to blow out a hundred candles?  Dennison No, I didn   t blow them.  Harmon She didn   t even get a piece of the birthday cake. Not one piece.  Dennison Huh?  Harmon I said you didn   t even get a piece of the birthday cake.  Dennison No, I didn   t even get a piece of my cake. They were all so excited to  visit they forgot all about me.  Harmon That night I said,    Mom, you didn   t even get any birthday cake.     Dennison I didn   t even get a piece of my cake. (Laughter)  Bishop I   d make them go out and buy another one.  Harmon Well, the Osage Minerals Council, they brought her a birthday cake  when they came a few days later.  Finchum Next year you get your piece first.  Dennison Okay. I was just thinking day I   m already a hundred and what, five days  old.  Harmon What   s the date today?  27  Dennison See, I   m already a hundred and five days.  Harmon Eight days.  Dennison Is today the fifth?  Finchum Today is the fifth?  Harmon Oh, she knows more than I do.  Dennison I think I   m getting older every day. (Laughter)  Finchum And wiser     Dennison I don   t know about that.  Bishop What   s the biggest challenge at your age? What do you find to be the  biggest challenge?  Dennison I don   t really know.  Harmon Getting through the day.  Dennison My whole life was a challenge I think.  Finchum When did you give up driving?  Dennison When I was about seventy.  Finchum You chose to?  Dennison I never did like to drive. After my husband died I quit driving. I drove  some after he died, but then after that, I quit driving. I really didn   t want  to go anyplace anyway, and the kids would take me if I did. I could  drive today if I had to, but I won   t do it on account of my eyesight. My  sister next door, she was an excellent driver. She drove right up to  about   how old was she?  Harmon Ninety-three when she passed away.  Dennison One day, when we lived on the lake, we come to town and there   s a  man walking down the road facing us. She was driving and she said to  me,    What is that down there?    I said,    That   s a man.    When we got  home, she handed me her keys. She said,    The cars in the garage. You  drive it anytime you want, but I   m not driving anymore.    She never did  drive again. That   s the hardest part for a lot of old people to give up, but  28  it   s too dangerous, you know. She said,    I don   t want to kill somebody  or kill myself,    so she never would drive anymore.  Bishop Well, at a hundred, is there anything on your bucket list that you still  want to do? Anything that you haven   t done in life that you still would  like to try?  Dennison No, I can   t think of anything. Seems like I did about everything that I  wanted to do in my life. I had a family, a good family, had a good  childhood, and my old age has been good, just like I say. Until this  happened to me, I was just like I was before. I could stay by myself. I  could cook a little bit. I could take care of all my own personal needs,  so really I can   t complain. I really can   t. I get discouraged now that this  happened, but I just have to get over it. Make the best of it.  Bishop By this you mean hurting your leg?  Dennison Yeah. Getting down like this to where I can   t   I went every place,  didn   t I?  Harmon Mom loved working in the flowers.  Dennison Went to Tulsa to eat and we   d go everywhere, you know. But all good  things come to an end I guess.  Bishop It   s not over yet. (Laughter) You   ve got to get your birthday cake next  year. Your piece, right? Well, I want to know, when history is written,  what would you like it to say about you?  Dennison Do what?  Finchum How do you want to be remembered?  Dennison I guess just remember that I tried to be a good person, a good Christian  person, a good mother, a good daughter, a good sister, a good friend,  and a good grandma. That   s the way I   d like to be remembered. I guess  that   s it. That   s the way I tried to live my life. I   ve always had God in  my life. I guess that   d be it.  Finchum You can put a check mark by all of those. Sounds like you have had a  very good life.  Dennison I have. I can   t complain.  Finchum Well, we appreciate you telling us a little bit about it today. Thank you.  29  Dennison I   m glad I   ve told you some things that interested.  Finchum Yes, very much. Thank you.  Dennison You   re welcome. It was real nice meeting you.  -------  -------
