Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 26524
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as a warm up, and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Do I have a favorite food?  Fruit, most of the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Two favorite times, spring and fall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: There is a place I would like to visit.  Alaska.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess you could say the Billie Holiday [jazz singer and songwriter] phrase.  "God bless the child who has his own."
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I like that one.
Story_ID: 26525
Speaker 1: So, I'm going to ask about your family history now.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family separate from your father's side and then we'll put them together.  So, can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Maiden name is Julia Ann Smalls. J-U-L-I-A; A-N-N; S-M-A-L-L-S.
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born March 4, 1919, and she was born in Horry County in South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Horry County--
Speaker 2: South Carolina.
Speaker 1: --South Carolina.  Okay.  Well, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side, and how far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Individually, I can't, but I can give you ethnicity, okay.  She's what you would call a Geechee, and her Geechees came from the West Indies.  To the nearest place we have been able to determine Jamaica was it.  They all lived together in one group.  She lived in Charleston, South Carolina for a long time and then they moved.
Speaker 1: First of all, give us your definition of a Geechee, what is a Geechee?
Speaker 2: Well, they called them Geechees because they lived in Charleston, South Carolina, a portion of them.  Some of them lived in, I think, in Savannah, Georgia.  And they came from the West Indies and they spoke the dialect.  There is this Geechee dialect where they, Gullah, they used these words.  When I was younger, I actually knew some of them, which I could actually say a little bit of it.  My mom taught us, but as I grew older and we didn't use it, I lost it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I know I first actually heard it in the movie "Glory" with James Ireland, I think.  And some Geechees ran right up to the black union solders and started talking it.  They sounded like they're from Jamaica and Patois.  I know my father had Geechees in his unit in the [U.S. Army, when he was in the Army.  But he couldn't give me a definition what a Geechee was, but from what I understand them, there's a group in the islands off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia who are considered Gullah Geechee people because of their cultural ties to the West Indies and the Africans.  Is that pretty much--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.  Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how my mom explained it to us, and that's how everybody else sees it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some even use African words.
Speaker 2: Yes.  They use African words, they use West Indian words.  It's mixed in with just regular English.  When we go there, it's really interesting, because we know what they're saying, we can't speak it, but when they say what they're saying, I understand it, I know what they're saying, because my mom did it and my grandma did it, but I can't say it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There are like cultural--other cultural forms of artwork and basket weaving and cooking?
Speaker 2: Yes, especially the cooking.  My mom was a different kind of cook in our part of South Carolina.  Everybody would come and ask her how to make certain foods and they all wanted to eat her food.  And she taught us the same things.  I know certain things, you just had to make it a particular way.  You couldn't do it the standard way that you might see it in the North especially.  In fact, people talk about me and the way I cook rice.  She taught us this particular way, and the rice always turns out such that it's dry--it's grainy, it's grainy, each grain to itself, because you always ate it with something.  You didn't--it wasn't in a dish so you may put gravy on it, you may eat it with other things, but it was never, I guess, soft and wet the way some people like to see rice.
Speaker 1: The white fluffy kind?
Speaker 2: Yes, ours is always a little bit different, but it always worked with all of the dishes that we ate.  And she was always the person that they wanted to do dinner on Sundays.  In the South having Sunday dinner at church is a big thing, and it was when I grew up.  She was always the main person that they wanted.
Story_ID: 26526
Speaker 1: Now when you were growing up, was rice a big crop?
Speaker 2: Actually, no.  We didn't grow it, and I heard from my mom [Julia Ann Smalls] that my grandfather used to grow it.  He grew rice when they lived in Charleston [South Carolina].  But by the time I was growing up, we didn't.  We had a totally different--we were the typical South Carolinians when it came to farming.  So, my father was different.
Speaker 1: Well, rice growing is hard--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --I've come to understand, very difficult.  They used to run through--back in slavery, they'd run through people.  It's called the big run.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: They would calculate how long a person would last?
Speaker 2: Oh, really.  I know my grandfather stopped.  She said he decided he just couldn't do it anymore, so he stopped.
Speaker 1: So, you knew your grandparents, right?
Speaker 2: No, actually, no.  My mom told us all of this.  My grandfather actually died one month before I was born.  I did know my grandmother.  Grandmother, we visited and my grandmother actually passed away after I was already married and working.  I was working at Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], then Hampton Institute when my grandmother died.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how far back do the stories on your mother's side go?
Speaker 2: My grandmother used to tell us things about my grandfather.  She talked to us about when he went to World War I and when the things that he did, the letters that he would send to her and how she would--when he came home, she cooked special things for him.  They had a place that they turned into a, what you called back then, a juke joint, okay.  Now, he didn't allow them to serve external alcohol.  I don't know if I should say this, but they made their own, what you called home brew, and it was--
Speaker 1: You should say it because the statute of limitations is passed and prohibition is over.  You can finally talk about that.
Speaker 2: --He would make home brew, and he served it at the juke joint that he ran.  Okay.  Everybody came around to get it.  And of course they were out in the country.  So given that they were out in the country, you do not have very many people other than members of the family and friends who were around them taking advantage of this particular thing.  And they did it all the time.  So he did it every year.  He never had a still, that was on my father's side.  But he did brew the home brew stuff, wine and what they called home brew were his forte.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, what was the name of their joint, do you know?
Speaker 2: Well, now, it was always--his last name.  So it was the Smalls Place.
Speaker 1: Now, that name has a particular significance to South Carolina.  I don't know if you're any relationship, but there's a great man name Robert Smalls back during the civil war who commandeered a Confederate boat by himself. He had been a slave and he got aboard the boat and steered it to Union lines, and he became a congressman and all that.
Speaker 2: To my knowledge we were not related.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We were not related to him.
Speaker 1: That was a famous name in South Carolina, Robert Smalls, at any rate--
Speaker 2: But it's worth--I'm going to follow up and check, because my grandparents never--my grandmother never mentioned him, but, now that you say that, I'm going to do some checking.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, it could indicate they were from the same place, if not the same family, you know.  It was that part of South Carolina, same part, coastal, South Carolina.  So, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Richard.  Richard Smalls.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother.
Speaker 2: Betty.  Betty Ann Smalls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26527
Speaker 1: So you can't go any further than your [maternal] grandparents [Richard and Betty Ann Smalls].  You can't trace back?
Speaker 2: I can't go any further than my grandparents.  They didn't tell--now, my grandmother [Betty Ann Smalls] didn't really like my grandfather's [Richard Smalls] mother.  So she never wanted to talk about her and I think his father was deceased early on, so she didn't know him.  But she didn't--the only thing that we knew was that grandma Betty did not like our grandfather's mother.  So she wouldn't talk about her.  She wouldn't tell us any of those things, it's like, no.  He was not always her favorite person.  They were separated for something like twenty-five years.  I'm talking about my grandparents.  I'll say this he was kind of not a nice man for part of the time.  He met another lady and left my grandmother, he lived with the other lady for twenty-five years and then, and to this day, my mother never knew what made the change or what happened, they got back together, and they got back together about six months before he died.  And she never--she said, I don't know what made a change, grandma never talked about it, but they decided to get back together after twenty-five years of being apart.
Speaker 1: That's quite a story.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 26528
Speaker 1: Now, did your [maternal] grandmother [Betty Ann Smalls] have any idea--you say you think they're from Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  That's what my grandmother said, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that was the story.  But she herself was born in the [United] States?
Speaker 2: No, no, my mother [Julia Ann Smalls].  Oh, you're talking about my grandmother?
Speaker 1: Your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yes, my grandmother was born in the [United] States.
Speaker 1: The family story--
Speaker 2: She was born in Charleston [South Carolina].
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Are there any other stories on that side from your grandmother?  I meant to ask you, did your grandfather [Richard Smalls] serve overseas during the war?
Speaker 2: HeHHHe did.  He was overseas, he was World War I.  She didn't tell us things that happened to him other than the fact that he was in the war and, now, when she was alive, she could actually tell you the date that he left to go overseas and the date that he came back, okay.  We used to say, grandma, when did you write this down?  But when she started talking, she could rattle off dates and times and places that you wouldn't believe.  But she never wrote any of this down or anything like that, but she would talk about when he was overseas, what she had to do to survive.  My mother and--I had an uncle, or two uncles, actually, Uncle King and Uncle Rich.  Of course, Uncle Rich was named for my grandfather, but, yes, she used to tell us about the things that she had to do, how much she worked, picked cotton, they worked in tobacco.
Story_ID: 26529
Speaker 1: My grandfather [Richard Smalls], at the time, was really, I guess you could say a little bit progressive.  He purchased land in Charleston as well as in Horry County [South Carolina].  And we actually still own it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So your grandfather bought land?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: Did he have any difficulty trying to get land?
Speaker 1: My mother [Julia Ann Smalls] never talked about his acquisition.  All she knew was that he always said, buy land and keep it, don't ever sell it once you get it.  So we paid the taxes on it for years, my mom did, and now my sister, whose executive of the estate does.  And I can tell you just a little itty, bitty story.  For years and years they sent us the bill, tax bill, every year we paid, and of course, in those days, you had to keep track, so my mom was very meticulous.  She kept the receipts that she paid, just years and years and years.  You know how they say throw things away after five years or seven years, but no, she just kept them forever.  So, I would say, maybe, eight years ago, they sent a notice that since the taxes had not been paid, the State of South Carolina was going to take the land.  I would guess the land that he purchased was worth more than a million dollars at that time.  So, older people, as you would guess, she went to the drawer and she pulled out the envelope that she had the receipts in, and she took the entire thing with her, and my sister drove her to Horry County, and they went to office and she pulled out all of the receipts from just years and years and years and years and years and years, and she up until the date that the last one had been paid, and she gave it to them, and she said, "Now, I have receipts showing that I have paid the taxes from this date through this one.  How is it that you can send me a letter indicating that the taxes haven't been paid so you are going to confiscate the land?"  And so, they then, of course they took copies of the last one and they gave her all of her documentation back, and they gave her something that's just clearing it up.  But all of us were surprised.  We thought, now how did they do that, how do you just decide that with years of receipts, and you've gotten money, each one of those years, but now, so we did have a scare or, you know, kind of a shock, at that point in time, but everything's straight now.
Speaker 2: Your grandmother was born during a period that historians now call the (unclear) of black history, where black people were taken advantage of so regularly that, you know, I think she probably knew that she had to keep the receipts.  This is my analysis.
Speaker 1: My husband calls me a hoarder, because we keep receipts from just years and years and years back.  You really don't need this.  But we're in a habit of doing it because of things like that.  So we just do it.  No change.
Speaker 2: Smart grandmother.
Story_ID: 26530
Speaker 1: So, now what did your mother [Julia Ann Smalls] say about growing up?  Is there a story about how the Smalls moved from Charleston [South Carolina] to Marion [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, they didn't move directly to Marion.  They moved to Horry County [South Carolina] first and then they ended up in Marion, South Carolina.  My mother ended up in Marion, South Carolina, during the time period that my grandfather [Richard Smalls] was not being quite so nice to my grandmother [Betty Ann Smalls].  He actually took my mother from my grandmother and brought her with him to Marion, South Carolina, when he was living with the other woman.  And so, literally, my mother and the other woman's daughter grew up together.  And believe it or not, they eventually married brothers.  But that's how my mother ended up in Marion, South Carolina.  My grandfather literally took her from my grandmother and brought her there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, now, did your mother have a chance to finish school?
Speaker 2: Actually, my mother finished school after, I mean, finished high school, after I graduated from college.  She attended school, grammar school, and that's where she stopped.  And she decided one day that she wanted her high school diploma.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, at the time she was in school, was it pretty common for the family members to only have gone through grammar school?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, because they had to stop and work.  So she stopped school and went to work.  And she worked on the farm for years.  She married my father [Albert Moody] when she was seventeen [years old] and during the next year, they had their first child and eventually had seven children.  And she was busy raising children and working on the farm during that time period.
Story_ID: 26531
Speaker 1: Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Albert Moody, A-L-B-E-R-T; and M-O-O-D-Y.
Speaker 1: Albert Moody, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: His date of birth is February 5, 1915 and he was born in Marion, South Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, now, Moody is the name for his mother, but his father's name actually was Grant.  So, technically, we're related a lot to the Grants in Marion, South Carolina.  So my grandmother, her name was Carrie, never married my grandfather, but she had lots and lots of children.  But for my father, there was only one.
Speaker 1: Okay, so she's got--her name was Carrie Moody?
Speaker 2: Her name was Carrie Moody.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandfather's name was--his last name was Grant, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And is first name was--What was his real first name?
Speaker 2: What was his real first name?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Shopper.
Speaker 1: Shopper Grant?
Speaker 2: Shopper Grant.
Speaker 1: Shopper with a "S"?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story behind that name?
Speaker 2: Nobody ever told us that.  He was dead long before we knew anything about him.  In fact, my grandmother actually died when my father was three and a half and my grandfather was alive longer than that, but he and my father did not really associate other than they might see each other at church a few times and he might talk to him, but he was--my father was really raised by his oldest sister.  So, even though we were taught to say "Grandpopper Shopper," there was never really any interaction with him.  And he died fairly on, I mean, before--just to give you an aside, my mom's [Julia Ann Smalls] children were born in two waves, and I'm in the second wave. So--
Speaker 1: I'll ask you about all your brothers and sisters in a little bit, but your father, you said he had a huge family of brothers and sisters, right?
Speaker 2: Of Grants and Moodys.
Speaker 1: Of Moodys but not so many Grants because you said that he was (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: No, no, Grandpopper Shopper Grant had other wives and women, so he had people on that side and then on the Moody side, he had several sisters and brothers, okay, so, yes.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the sister that raised your father?
Speaker 2: Aunt Ophelia (ph.).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was she significantly older than your father?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Big Auntie, is what we called her.  Her name is Ophelia, but we called her Big Auntie, yes.  And as her name indicates, she was big.
Speaker 1: You know, that could throw you off sometimes, because I've heard some people named Big Momma, and they were little, tiny--.
Speaker 2: I know.  She wasn't so tall as she was round and roley poley, but she was Big Auntie, and she was the one that raised my father.  And she was much older--my father was the baby of the family and between my father and--there were four girls, three boys, I mean, my father was the last one, so there was seven children before him.  So, yes, she was the oldest, so, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did your father have any stories about--well how far back can you go with his family, can you go back any further than your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Not any further than Grandma Carrie and Grandpopper Shopper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  As far as you know, they don't have a history of being in any other part of the country.
Speaker 2: No, no.  They grew up in that little area.  In fact, so often that area is called Moody Township, I mean, where we grew up was called Moody Township.  The Moodys were there and they stayed and stayed and stayed, for the longest time.
Story_ID: 26532
Speaker 1: Did your father [Albert Moody] have any stories about growing up, himself?
Speaker 2: My father grew--well, he grew up on a farm, farming, I should say, and unfortunately, he had to stop school, at the age, I mean, he stopped in the fifth grade.  He wanted to be, and this is always what he told us, a brain surgeon, but he had to stop school, and part of the reason, of course, was because my aunt [Ophelia (ph.)] was taking care of him, they needed to be--in those days, sharecropping was the way to go, okay.  So he started as a sharecropper and he worked for the local landowner, the McIntyres [ph.].  The McIntyres owned the land in that area, and so, he as you would say, he plowed, using a mule and his daily wages went to my aunt so that they could live in the house provided on the land and work the land.  And he would talk about--those were the kinds of things that he told us about, what he had to do when he was growing up to be able to live.  They shared a house, the same house for years.  And everybody had a room, so Aunt Ophelia, Big Auntie, had a room and Aunt Bessie had a room.  Aunt Bessie had two children and they had theirs and, literally, my father's part of the house was the kitchen.  So a part of the kitchen was designated to him.  And they had two fires, you know, back-to-back fire places, so fire place in the kitchen, fire place on the other side, and then he had to go from those two rooms to the others.  So I guess if you were talking about being warm, he had one of the better parts of the house, because he had the kitchen.  The fire place and stove were there.
Speaker 1: He wouldn't miss any meals either, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right, he wouldn't miss any meals.  So they talked about how they shared a house and everybody worked on the farm for the McIntyres for years.  And eventually, of course, everybody, you know, grew up, got married, moved out to their own houses and left the house to my mom [Julia Ann Smalls] and my dad.  And of course he ended up farming for years.  Eventually, he purchased the land where the house is and some other land around there.
Speaker 1: So his relationship with the McIntyres was fairly good?
Speaker 2: Oh, they, in fact, the land where the house sits and everything that surround it, they actually gave that to him.  He didn't have to purchase it; they gave it to him.  We purchased other land, but they gave that to him.  He worked with Mr. Archie, the main owner, where we worked, around them there were several brothers, and then when Mr. Archie died, his son took over and, same name sake, he was a junior.  My father worked with him for years until he got to the point where he retired from farming.
Story_ID: 26533
Speaker 1: Okay, I have to ask you this question.  I have to go back to what your father's [Albert Moody] aspiration was to become a brain surgeon because it's a STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] aspiration, a science aspiration.  Is there a story behind how he came up with that?
Speaker 2: Well, he liked working on animals, okay, and he decided he liked to do that.  So on the farm he didn't have a whole lot of opportunities to do those things, because you had to do the manual stuff.  But every opportunity that he got, he actually worked on the animals.  So he worked--we had cows and we had swine, so, not so many goats, a goat was just there for people's pleasure, things like that. But if anything went wrong with them, he would work on them, and he liked doing that; didn't have the opportunity to work on people, but he never wanted to be a veterinarian.  He said, he wanted to actually to be able to do those kinds of things on people, and he had a hard time, this is what he told us, he had a hard time when they told him that he had to stop going to school and actually start working because they needed him to work all day, making money.  Before he stopped completely, he told us he would get up at four o'clock in the morning, he would go and work on the farm, then he would come back, eat and go to school.  And then when he came home from school, he would get back out into the fields and work until dark, so you couldn't see.  So he actually tried to prolong it by working early and by working late so he could go to school in between, but eventually that just didn't work, so he had to stop going to school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your father or mother [Julia Ann Smalls] have a particularly high aptitude for math?
Speaker 2: My father did.  Everything that he did on the farm, he did himself.  When he laid out his acreage and made decisions on what the yield would be for the land--we planted cotton, corn, tobacco, wheat and lots of garden-related things, how much land you needed to plant for the yield that he wanted to make the amount of money, he figured all that out himself.  In fact, I can tell you, one day when--this was after I was in college and went back.  I used to go back home and work on the farm every summer.  He was telling me how to figure out what to do with the land, how to get the yield that you wanted and how many acres and what you had to do.  And it was amazing to me that he could do this, and he did it all in here (indicating head).  He didn't--no calculators, no whatevers, he did it here (indicating), and he did a few things on paper, but mostly, he did it in here (indicating).  Early on he helped us with our homework.  So up to the point where he had gone to school, he helped us all do our work for grade school and the early part of grammar school.  He's the one who helped us do our work.  So, he could do those things.  He surprised me because there were times I had to use the calculator to get it done.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Like I said, you know, a brain surgeon is an aspiration, it seems like a pretty big aspiration, but he was already doing veterinary things.  He had a sense that he could do something.  Did he have any--did he know like the traditional herbal remedies for--
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness, yes.  We never went to the doctor, never went to the doctor until things were really, really serious, otherwise, between my mother and my father, we didn't go.  Brewed us tea and drink it, you felt better, eat this, you felt better, making combinations of things so that you would have a medication that would solve the problem, that's all that they did.  In fact, I can honestly tell you, I probably went to the doctor for the first time--somehow, I had low blood pressure and I was getting weak, and nobody could figure out why.  That's the first time that I could remember having gone the doctor when I was growing up, first time.  Other than that--
Speaker 1: How old were you?
Speaker 2: Early high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, we went--you had to go for shots, you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Vaccinations?
Speaker 2: Yeah, vaccinations and things like that, but I mean literally seeing a doctor, didn't do that, didn't have to, they gave us the remedies. We were okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26534
Speaker 1: All right now, is there a story about how your parents [Albert Moody and Julia Ann Smalls] met or fell in love?
Speaker 2: Well, the story that we hear is, I don't know if you would call it how they met and fell in love, but everybody, of course, saw each other only on Sundays, of course.  That's because you were working all week.  And there wasn't so much of going downtown.  The socialization happened at church.  And really and truly, you could say--my father was actually, everybody had predicted, going to marry another woman, Miss Emma.  They said that Miss Emma was the love of his life, and he was supposed to marry her.  My mom was just one of the people at church, and they were all friends.  But somehow, and my father would never tell us what happened, Miss Emma made him angry one day, so they broke up, and she went one way and he went the other.  And everybody expected them to get back together, but a year went by, nothing, two years went by, nothing.  And then one day at church, he started paying attention to my mom, and the rest is history.  They just--and I can tell you, my father was a closed-mouthed man.  He didn't talk much.  He wasn't a gossiper.  He kind of didn't tell stuff, and that's all of his life.  He just--close mouthed.  And the rumor on the side is that one of the few times that he ever did things that he wasn't supposed to, in those days, I guess, and again, I don't know whether I should say this, but whatever she did, I'm talking about Miss Emma, she actually got a rise out of him.  He actually grabbed her and shook her, okay.  He didn't do stuff like that, so whatever she did, she made him really, really, really angry, because she made him angry enough to shake her.  And that's all that he would ever tell, and that's all that anybody knew, that he was angry enough to shake her and they separated after that and never got back together.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your family-the church out there [Marion, Soutjh Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Singletary AME [African Methodist Episcopal].
Speaker 1: Singletary AME, okay.  That's kind of an interesting name.  I think the only time I've heard it in a black community is with Mike Singletary, the football player--
Speaker 2: I know.
Speaker 1: --With the Bears.  Is he related to anyone in that area that you know of?
Speaker 2: (Indicating no).  It's been Singletary AME forever.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And it's in Marion [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: We were saying before we started this interview that Marion is named after Francis Marion, the revolutionary war--
Speaker 2: Right Swamp Fox.
Speaker 1: Swamp Fox, yeah, Colonel Francis Marion, who celebrated all over the area with iconography and Walt Disney did a TV show about him.
Speaker 2: We were so pleased with that.  That's the one thing that everybody watched in Marion, South Carolina, they watched Walt Disney's show about The Swamp Fox.
Speaker 1: Swamp Fox was played by Leslie Nielsen, I remember that, and his Tonto, so to speak, was a black man that played a guitar or banjo.
Speaker 2: Yes, banjo.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' [Albert Moody and Julia Ann Smalls] personalities, first of all, their dispositions, the way they walk, talk, what they look like, what people thought about them, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, in looks, my father, probably in personality, more of my mom with some of my dad, in the following sense.  As far as being aggressive, initiative, things like that, probably I have some of my mom and my dad for that because I will do things.  I'll get involved, I kind of don't hang back like my dad.  I'm the type of person where you know where I stand on practically everything.  I'm political, but for the most part, you know where I stand.  I'm not going to stab you in the back without you knowing that this is what I feel.  If you don't do the right thing--I'm a policy and procedure person, for the most part, so as a policy and procedure person, if you're not following the policies, then I'm likely to let you know that.  You're not doing things the correct way I'm likely to let you know that.  If you decide to keep going and not do it, but I'm going to let you know that this is the policy, this is the procedure and this is what you're expected to do.  My father was a policy and procedure person, my mom was a, let me help you.  She wanted you to do the right thing, but she was going to try to be nicer to you.  My father was policy and procedure and he wanted you to follow policy and procedure, and if you didn't do the right thing, he was likely to stand back from you, if you weren't doing the right thing.  And I'm probably likely in that instance to do things like that.  So, I guess in that sense, I'm more like him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you confront things?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Head on?
Speaker 2: I kind of confront things head on.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now--
Speaker 2: By the same token, of course, when you confront things head on, then you get beat up a lot.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you have to have a tough skull.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 26537
Speaker 1: Now do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Of things that I did, wanted to do?
Speaker 1: Well, no, an earliest childhood memory, period.  What's the first thing that you remember?  Is there a first thing, or as far back as you can go, what's the first thing that you remember?
Speaker 2: I'm making sure that I separate these things from, not from what I was told, but from what I actually did.
Speaker 1: Now, that's the challenge.  Everybody has to do that.  That's to separate what they really know--
Speaker 2: The first thing that I was told was a really good thing, I like it.  I tell people this all the time.  I mean, when you move forward--
Speaker 1: What is it, what is it?
Speaker 2: --I walked when I was seven months old.  My mom [Julia Ann Smalls] said how she discovered that I could walk.  I was in the crib and she walked to the door and she saw me walking from one end of the crib to the other, and she was amazed, and I was seven months old, and she didn't know how long I'd been walking.  She just knew that I was seven months, and I could walk from one end of the crib to the other.  So when my father [Albert Moody] came home that day, she said she took me out of the crib and she sat in the chair and she had me on the floor and she told my father stand over there.  And she said, okay, you stay there and then she got up and she put me in front of him and she went back and sat in the chair and she said, "Come here, baby," and I walked from him to her.  And he got a surprise that day.  So, when I was seven months old, I walked.  But I would say the best one, and the one that probably sticks in my mind is when I went to school, the first grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's the thing that sticks with me more than anything.  I really enjoyed learning.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school?
Speaker 2: Springville Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Springville?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Still exists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It's a special school now, but still exists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26538
Speaker 1: Now, I'm going to ask you about that first day of school in a minute, but can you tell us about your brothers and sisters, how many brothers and sisters do you have and where do you fit in?
Speaker 2: Well, there are seven of us.  And five girls, two boys and three girls and two boys were born first.
Speaker 1: Can you name them all for us?
Speaker 2: My sister, Betty, is the oldest sister and she was named for my grandmother [Betty Ann Smalls].  And then my sister, Albertine, is second.
Story_ID: 26539
Speaker 1: So, Betty, Albertine?
Speaker 2: Oh, Albertine, named for my father [Albert Moody], and then Arthur and then Richard and then Betsy, she was named for my Aunt Betsy and, of course, Richard was named for my grandfather [Richard Smalls] and then me, and I have a sister, Sandra, who's last.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And there's five years' difference between Betsy and me.  That's why--it was one of these things where they decided five children was enough.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did your brothers and sisters have a chance to go to college, too?
Speaker 2: Actually, now two of my siblings--three of my siblings actually are now deceased, but my oldest [Betty Moody] sister got an AA [associate of arts] degree, my sister, Albertine, received her bachelor's [degree] and master's [degree] and I think in the old days, you know, there used to be something that you could get called an advanced certificate in education, she acquired an advanced certificate.  My brother, Arthur, got a GED [General Educational Development].  He dropped out of high school when he was in his senior year, one course, so he eventually got his GED.  My brother, Richard, graduated from high school.  My sister, Betsy, received--has a master's, and of course, I have a Ph.D.  And my youngest sister has an AA, so all of the girls did at least an AA through Ph.D. Do you have any thoughts about what the pattern is in terms of the boys just finishing high school.  Was it because of the demand for work in those days?
Speaker 1: Actually, it wasn't.  It's because they were hard knuckle heads.  My parents [Albert Moody and Julia Ann Smalls] had this wish and desire everybody had to finish high school.  I mean it wasn't even a choice.  That was them.  You went to school every day unless there was something major to stop you.  You had to go to school every day.  So you got up, you caught the bus.  It was one of these things.  My father and my mother did those things and they pushed us to go to school, graduate, get a degree. The girls tended to take much more easily to wanting to do that.  The boys wanted to have fun, they, you know, and we were always wondering why, because both of my parents were adamant about us going to school.  It was just not an option, you had to go to school, I'm talking about for high school, and for college, even with starting with just working on the farm, starting as a sharecropper, my father would always say, if you go, I will do everything I can to make sure you get your degree.  And so we did that.  Now, most of the girls actually received scholarships to go.  So it wasn't an issue of him having to pay a large amount of money for us to go to school, in fact, he was able to pay very little for us to go to school, and the boys, of course, just wouldn't go beyond high school.  They went into the military, so both of my brothers were in the military.  My brother, Arthur, served in Korea, and my brother, Richard, served in Vietnam.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Did either one make a career of the military?
Speaker 1: No.  They both served what, three to five years, and then they got out and went to work.  Neither one was career.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I didn't know if there was a pattern in this?
Speaker 1: I know.  The girls really looked at this a few times, said why is it that all of the girls got at least an AA, but the boys were just what they would call knuckle heads.
Speaker 2: There was a pattern previously in rural communities where the girls were expected to go to school and become a teacher or something, and the boys they just did the farm work.
Speaker 1: My father gave everybody the opportunity to go ahead and go to school, boys included.  And as far as teachers, actually, my oldest sister didn't go to become a teacher, she actually became a seamstress and a beautician.  My second sister, Albertine, did become a teacher.  My sister, Betsy, was in social work.  And my sister, Sandra, was in finance, and, of course, I was a teacher.  So we did a little bit of everything.
Story_ID: 26540
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Okay, sights, we saw lots and lots of tobacco, okay.  We saw lots and lots of cotton, lots and lots of corn, wheat and gardens.  And you helped harvest these things.  I tell my students all of the time, you don't understand what life is like.  I've broken corn just like anybody else.  I've harvest tobacco, I've harvest cotton, I've driven tractors, I've driven wagons with mules, so all of those things I did as I was approaching high school, and I've done it after--through high school and after I was in college.  I would go home during the summers and work.  Smells, since we lived on a farm, stables, so we--you took care of the animals, so the smells that you have in the stables.  So look at your--I just have to say this, there's manure in the barns, you have to clean it.  Hay, you have to make sure that they eat.   Grass, the smell of cut grass, turned earth, freshly turned earth, because we worked with that as well.  So, sights.  Sounds, you're listening at farm animals when they're, you know, eating, the noises that they make, sounds as far as tractors, people, but not so much with people, because we didn't live close to people.  You know, there were people, but farm houses were far apart, because you had--you had people here, people there, all around, so when you walked to church, you walked maybe, I don't know, mile or so, things like that, those kinds of things, those sights, those sounds.  Yes, I mean, and of course, TV went off at what, eleven o'clock.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Eleven o'clock.  Okay, so you did have television?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not my entire life, probably television when I was in the fifth grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1962, or so?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 26541
Speaker 1: All right, so television, did you have any favorite programs on television?
Speaker 2: Everybody watched 'Gunsmoke', come on, had to watch 'Gunsmoke'.  In fact, you had to watch 'Gunsmoke', you watched the cattle drive, 'Rawhide', of course, and there was--well, of course, there were the soap operas.  When I was a young--I mean, at that age, literally, I stayed at home and took care of my nephew, and we had to remember what happened on the soap operas so that I could tell my sisters and my mom [Julia Ann Smalls] when they came home at mid-day, and then when they came home at the end of the work day.  So my memory got a serious workout, and I was able to do lots and lots of things because of that.  I can tell everybody soap operas actually helped me as far as learning is concerned because I had to memorize, and I had to memorize what was said and who said it so that they could keep up, because during the winter of course, you don't work on a farm, you do everything during the summer and when you finished during the summers then the money that you make for the summer is what you survived on during the winter for farms, at least that's what happened during those days.  So, during those times I pretty much, I was it.
Speaker 1: That was like your job to--
Speaker 2: It was my job.
Speaker 1: --Monitor the soap operas and take care of the little one.
Speaker 2: I took care of the little one and I had to watch TV and make sure that I could tell everybody what happened and who, so that they never missed a beat.  I was the tape recorder.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26542
Speaker 1: So I know your parents [Albert Moody and Julia Ann Smalls] were in favor of education.  Did you have lots of materials to read at home?
Speaker 2: Actually, no.  What I had were my sisters' old books.  In those days you purchased the books, you didn't do as you do now where you rent them and then you give them back at the end of the school year, you purchased.
Speaker 1: Okay, so South Carolina actually made public school students buy their books?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, now this was not true in Ohio.  I know, I grew up there, or in Illinois. So this is--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  When I was in school, we purchased.  Yes.  And so I still had my sisters' old books and my brothers'.   So, what I actually did during the summer and during the year, I would read their books and some of the stories that you hear about now were in their literature books.  The 'Midas Touch' was a story in their literature books, the Firebird story, story of Sisyphus, all those things were in their literature books.  So when I went to college, when I was in class and we were talking about--the teacher started talking about the Sisyphus story one day, and he said who knows the name of--and I raised my hand, and I could tell him, and he said, how do you know that?  I said, I read that years ago in my sisters' literature books.  So all of the books that they acquired were there for us to read and get as much knowledge out of as we could, so each one did a little more for those of us who came after.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that sounds like the house became populated with books because you had to buy your own books?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So did people routinely resale their books to other students?
Speaker 2: Sometimes people did, but for the most part, they held onto their books.  There was not a thing of selling your books to somebody else early on.  Later in life sometimes we sold the books to somebody, I mean, you know, just other students.  But for the most part, early on, you just kept the books, you did not sell them.  So the math books, literature, those I remember especially, the math books and the literature books.  I spent a lot of time in the math books and the literature books.
Story_ID: 26543
Speaker 1: Now, as far as you know, you went to a segregated school--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --A black school.  And the state of South Carolina, historically has been revealed now that they did not spend the same amount of money on the black public schools as they did on the white ones.  So did the white students have to purchase their books, did you know?
Speaker 2: They did.  Where the difference came in was library usage in a lot of the schools.  When we wanted to do reports, most of the time, we shared with other students.  Some of the parents purchased sets of encyclopedias, those were the days when the salesmen went around selling encyclopedias, and some parents purchased them every year.  So when we had reports to do, we would go to their houses.  We would go to our teachers' houses because most of the time, the most up-to-date books were not in the libraries at our schools.  So when we wanted to go to the library, we had library periods so that you would actually go to the library to do work in research when we were growing up.  But the books were out of date.  So we actually went to peoples' houses.  That's how we did a lot of our work, how we stayed up.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So you started off at Springville--
Speaker 2: Springville Elementary.
Speaker 1: --Elementary School.  So you said you remember the first grade.  What happened that day?
Speaker 2: My first grade teacher, Mrs. Duboze, okay, that's what happened that day.  Somehow I was assigned to the best class, or the right class.  I won't say--I'll take back best in a sense that I'm not claiming tha--there were two first-grade teachers, I'm not claiming that the other first-grade teacher wasn't good, I just know that Mrs. Duboze was good for me.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell her last name?
Speaker 2: D-U-B-O-Z-E.
Speaker 1: O-Z-E, okay.  Duboze.  Now, what was so special about Mrs. Duboze.
Speaker 2: I don't know, she was just wonderful.  She could impart the information and give you enthusiasm.  She was enthusiastic and she made things work.  So, from the first day I decided I wanted to be a teacher like Mrs. Duboze, and I never changed my mind about that.  She just did the right things.  We learned a lot.  Reading, now I knew how to read a little bit before I went to school, I knew my alphabet and all of that stuff.  But she made reading so interesting and now they tell you this, I didn't realize it then, of course, because I was young, but reading was the best. The better I got at reading, the better I became at everything else.  So when I say I used my sisters' books and my brothers' books, the reading just made, being able to read much, much better, gave me, I don't know, made me want to read more and it makes you see the world.  You could see travels.  I learned so many things about other places because I could read.  And that--so she made that wonderful for me, first day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26544
Speaker 1: Now were you interested in math as a first grader?
Speaker 2: You know, I was interested in math, period, but I didn't know it.  Now, you say, well, what do you mean, you didn't know it?  Well, you know, you take five subjects or six, so I was good at math, but I didn't realize that I would be using it at this point in my life, but I was good at it.  I was good at reading and mathematics.  I was good at the other things because I could read, but I liked those best.  And the math subjects, I could do the word problems, I could do the--well, I'll tell you one, this was in high school getting ready to go off to college, my high school math teacher was Dr. James Blake, and he got his doctorate later, he was Mr. Blake at that time.  But he hurt me to my heart one day.  You know how you're careless, he gave us a test and we were factoring, and I got all of the numbers correctly done, but you're supposed to put them in parentheses, so I would have half the parentheses there so I might have the left one and not the right one, and so every time I missed one of the parentheses, he took off minus two, okay.  And so that just hurt me to my heart, because it made my grades like 72 and I wasn't supposed to make 72 on a factoring test.  I mean, come on, I've been making 100s on these things, and I have a 72 because he took off points.  So he taught us a valuable lesson.  If it's important to you then take some points, because people will remember to this day, I don't miss parentheses on things, I don't miss anything like that, I'm really, really careful about those things from that one lesson.  This happened when I was still in high school, and I remember it to this day, like it was yesterday.  It's like, no.  He said important things, if you want your students to really do it, take points.  To this day a student does something simple like that, I take a minus point five, I mean, I don't even take two points, I just take point five, they remember, they never do it again.  So the same lesson that he taught me all those years ago, I do it every year, and it works.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how many students at Springville, was it, would you say, how big an elementary school was it?
Speaker 2: It only went through the fifth grade, about twenty, twenty-five students per class.
Speaker 1: How many classes were there, I mean five classes, was it--
Speaker 2: Every grade had one section excepting for first grade.  First grade, there were about twenty-five to thirty of us, but they divided us between Ms. Duboze and Miss Fore [ph.].
Speaker 1: --Okay.  So, basically, six classrooms?
Speaker 2: Six classrooms but only five grades.
Speaker 1: Did you have some kind of assembly hall, cafeteria or something.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, uh-huh.  The cafeteria was the place for assembly as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 26545
Speaker 1: You grew up during the heart of the Civil Rights Movement in the South, and a lot of it was going on in the North, too.  These people here don't say that but, my hometown was going through it.  So, but not as--I don't think they had they had the same disparity and rights, you know, in some of the northern cities, but there was discrimination, too.  So in your part of South Carolina, did you have a sense of what was going on when you were a kid?
Speaker 2: Actually, we did not.  I discovered that when I went to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], okay.  That's where the biggest hit in the face occurred.  For the most part in South Carolina, didn't come home to us.  Newspapers were virtually nonexistent.  We received a newspaper once a week.  It was on Wednesdays.  You got the 'Marion Star' on Wednesdays.  The Marion Star carried local news, almost nothing from the outside.
Speaker 1: So nothing about civil rights activity?
Speaker 2: TV, now of course when we came home from school, we went to work on the farm, so there was no watching TV when you stepped off of the bus, you changed your clothes, you went to the farm.  You came home, you did your chores then you had your homework to do.  So you didn't put a great deal of time on the TV.
Speaker 1: So you didn't watch the TV news, Walter Cronkite [broadcast journalist], or any of that?
Speaker 2: You saw very little Walter Cronkite, because there was too much to do.  So the Civil Rights Movement as it was, was not a prominent thing when I was in high school.  When I went to Hampton that's when life became interesting and it hit me in the face.
Speaker 1: So were you aware of Dr. [Martin Luther] King when you were in grade school?
Speaker 2: We were aware of him, yes.
Speaker 1: As a youngster growing up in Marion, did you face discrimination in town, you know, black and white water fountains--
Speaker 2: Oh, of course.
Speaker 1: --Toilets and that stuff?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  You couldn't--well, of course, there were certain places that you just didn't go into at all.  And then if you did, you went to this part of the counter and everybody else went to the other parts of the counter.   And there was no--there was no chance of you eating in this place, okay.
Speaker 1: Would your parents [Albert Moody and Julia Ann Smalls] give you instructions, when you were very young about what you could and could not do?
Speaker 2: Oh, we learned by the time I was in high school, grammar school, they didn't have to give us instructions, because we learned it in elementary school.  It was like you always looked for where we were supposed to go versus where our white counterparts could be.  I think schools became--I think the year after I graduated, they took away separate-but-equal through--they went from segregation to separate-but-equal, while I was in high school.  But the--
Speaker 1: The integration of the schools didn't happen until--
Speaker 2: --Didn't really happen, okay.  And even in the towns, they'd say well now you can sit at this part.  I mean everybody can sit at the same place and buy food and eat.  For the most part, you just didn't do it, because you really, while you were there, you got the feeling, we don't want you here.  So you continued to go to the places that you've always went.  You didn't get--the kinds of jobs that you received in the department stores weren't the same, things like that.  So, that's even during the time when I was there, it was like, no, just didn't work.  But, so, yes, segregation was there and then the schools, separate-but-equal, that still didn't work.  The textbooks were still bad.  We received textbooks that had gone to the white schools, the students' names were written in them, and they collected them and they sent them to us, because they didn't have the content that they should have.  So pretty much, our teachers didn't teach us from the books either, they actually acquired content from other places and they taught us.  So things like that were happening while I was in high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26546
Speaker 1: Did you have a middle school?
Speaker 2: We had a grammar school.
Speaker 1: I mean, that's (simultaneously)--
Speaker 2: In those days it was a grammar school.
Speaker 1: --where did you go?
Speaker 2: Marion Grammar School.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Marion Grammar School.  Okay, that's what they called it.  It would be like the equivalent of a middle school, or junior high school now?
Speaker 2: It had sixth grade, seventh grade.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much a middle-schooler.
Speaker 2: High school for us used to have eighth through twelfth [grades].  In the middle of my eighth grade year, they changed it, and for half of the year, we did eighth grade at the high school and for the other half of the year, they built onto the grammar school, and they put eighth grade at the grammar school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the name of it was Marion Grammar School, then your high school was called?
Speaker 2: Johnakin High School.  It was named for one of the principals.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: J-O-H-N-A-K-I-N.
Speaker 1: Johnakin High School, okay.  All right.  So were you were--I take it you were a pretty decent student in school?
Speaker 2: Pretty good.  Should I tell you I was valedictorian of my class?
Speaker 1: Yes.  So you were valedictorian in high school?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So were you the top student all the way through school?
Speaker 2: Pretty much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I should tell you a part of this.  There were two valedictorians in my family.  My sister, Albertine, was valedictorian when she graduated and I was valedictorian when I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So, when you were in high school, was your favorite subject mathematics, at that point?
Speaker 2: It was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there a reason why it was?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I was good at it.  That's the best reason I can tell you.  Mr. [James] Blake was a great math teacher.  But now, let me say, he was not my only math teacher.  Mr. Boykins was my ninth grade algebra teacher.  After that we went to Mr. Blake, and we pretty much had Mr. Blake for the rest of the time.
Speaker 1: So how far did you go in mathematics in high school, did you get to calculus.
Speaker 2: No.  We did not get to calculus.  I did not get calculus until like I got to college.  We did trig [trigonometry]--we got as far as trig.  We did not have a calculus teacher.  We didn't have enough so that they could separate the students to do that.  They taught us French, and we had to bring somebody in from the outside.  So for some things we could bring somebody in from the outside, otherwise, we didn't.  So, calculus I did when I got to college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26547
Speaker 1: Now, were you class officer?
Speaker 2: I was an officer for the student council.  Student council is what they used to have, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, student council.  What other activities were you involved in?
Speaker 2: I was chair of the yearbook committee, I was Miss Mathematics.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they actually have a contest for this, Miss Mathematics, okay.
Speaker 2: I was Miss Mathematics, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what was the contest like for Miss Mathematics?  Did you have to solve--
Speaker 2: Well, you had to--well, actually, it was based--they looked at references and grades.  So you had to actually pass, I mean, you had to have good grades through all of your work up to a certain point, so I was Miss Mathematics for that time period.  I was voted most likely to succeed by my classmates, things like that.
Speaker 1: So you were pretty lively student in high school, I guess, you were involved in a lot of things, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, and had good grades, was valedictorian.  So did you give a valedictorian victory speech?
Speaker 2: I did.  Yes.  Nowadays students read them.  We had to memorize our speech.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you remember what yours was about?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a variety of things.  But mostly it was about doing work and succeeding, okay.  So I had to talk about companies that actually were successful.  At that time, of course, one of the main companies that was successful was the Greyhound Bus Company.  So, in my speech I actually referenced the Greyhound Bus Company.  I also referenced people who had their own businesses and I referenced farmers in what they had to do in their everyday lives to make it.  So as we moved forward--as we worked and moved forward then you had to "climb every mountain."  So "climb every mountain" was also a part--that song was also referenced in my speech.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what year did you graduate?
Speaker 2: High school, 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, 1969.  Now, would you consider Mr. [James] Blake like a mentor.
Speaker 2: Oh, always.  Mr. Blake was wonderful.  He wanted us to go to college.  You couldn't miss his class.  But when it was time for us to think about college, he made sure that we got all of our shots, he made sure that we were exposed--I told you about us having trig, he literally changed his schedule and put in extra time so that we could have trig as a part of our background before we went to college, because there was no trig class.  So he actually did extra so that we could do that.  So, yes.  He really wanted everybody to be as prepared as possible to go to college.  So he got no additional compensation, he just did it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26548
Speaker 1: Now, you went to Hampton [University], but how did Hampton come into the picture.  Did Mr. [James] Blake [Langdon's math teacher in high school] recommend it or some other adult?
Speaker 2: It was the English teacher.
Speaker 1: English teacher.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  It was the English teacher.
Speaker 1: What was her name?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Taugh (ph.), Rosa Taugh.
Speaker 1: It's interesting to me that it seem like the people that, especially from the South went to segregated schools, so-called segregated schools, remember the names of every teacher.  They don't forget their teachers.
Speaker 2: No. Well, now let's face it.  Those people were kind of the extended family.  If you went to school, and you didn't do what you were supposed to do, they didn't have telephones to call your parents they got in the car and went to your house, because they knew where you lived.  So Mrs. Taugh has been to my house several times.  My chemistry teacher was Miss Cooper.  Miss Cooper has been to my house.  The Boykins [ph.] have been to my house, Mr. Boykins was my ninth grade algebra teacher.  I mean, you couldn't do--not do things.  If you didn't do your work, you were punished at school and then they told your parents.  And then when you got home you were punished.  So, yes, they took care of you at school.  Your parents took care of you at home, they took care of you at school, and you did not have an issue of, Mom, Miss Taugh is not really being accurate.  No, that was not even an issue.  If she took the time to go to your house and talk about you to your parents, there was something serious going on.  So, no.  The things that you hear about students nowadays (shaking head no).
Speaker 1: Things didn't go on then?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you're valedictorian and you know you're going to Hampton.  I mean, did you know it by the time you were graduating?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Mrs. Taugh's sister lived in Hampton.  Prior to my going to Hampton, Mrs. Taugh's daughter had gone to Hampton, and when I finished and she was looking at my grades and all of that, she said--she recommended that I go to Hampton.  So I put in my application and Hampton accepted me and they gave me a scholarship.  I was a Ford Scholarship recipient.  In those days it was a good thing for companies to give scholarship money to HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] and I was a recipient of a Ford Fellowship.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you worked during the summer, I guess--
Speaker 2: On the farm.
Speaker 1: --on the farm before you went to Hampton, and you said that--what was the first day like at Hampton?  Had you been very far away from Marion [South Carolina]?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, actually, I should say, yes.  My sister lived in New York.  My sister, Albertine, lived in New York, she taught in New York.  So, I actually visited her several times, and she was actually the person at home who had gone further than anybody else for education.  So she pushed us.  And I should say she and I mimicked each other more than the other siblings with what we did in accomplishments, because she was pretty much a math--now in her day she majored in home economics, because that's what you did, but she was very good in math.  So, that's what I mean by we mimicked each other; she was valedictorian, and then I was and she had done really well in her math classes.
Speaker 1: What was the notion alive and afoot in those days that math was for males?
Speaker 2: You want an answer?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Oh.  Well, there was, but not at my high school.  At my high school, as far as Mr. Blake was concerned, women could excel as much or more than males, and the same thing was true for Mr. Boykins, who was my teacher, and I had a history teacher who felt the same way, Mr. Armstrong was the history teacher.  And all of these people, by the way, were the same teachers that my sister, Albertine, had.  And they felt like females could excel just as much.  First and second were always females for years at my high school.  So, we always got pushed by these teachers.
Story_ID: 26549
Speaker 1: All right, 1969, at Hampton University.  Well, tell us about your first day at Hampton?
Speaker 2: Well, believe it or not, my first day was a little different than what people would expect.  I had to go early, okay.  So that means the first day we were supposed to arrive, it would have been on Monday.  But my father's [Albert Moody] truck had problems, so we had to hire somebody to take me to school.  So, literally, I had to go a day early.  So they took me on Saturday, because the person who took us had to be at work on Monday and, of course, couldn't take me on Sunday.  So, literally, my mom [Julia Ann Smalls] and one of our neighbors drove me to school on Saturday, and so there were only--and two other people had the same problem.  So three of us were in the dorm that night, and the dorm mother was there.  And when we showed up, of course, we surprised her to death, because of course we weren't supposed to be there.  So we were there that day and the next day.  And then on Monday, when we were actually supposed to be there to sign in and register and all of that stuff, so I was able to do that and my scholarships were all there in place, everything was there, and you know, well in those days we had a week of orientation.  So we went around, we registered during that week, we learned the Hampton song, we found our other buildings that we were supposed to go to for our classes, we took our testing, we did all of those things within the first five days at Hampton, and I ended up actually taking two tests because I wanted to be a math major.  So, to be a math major, I had to prove to them that I knew algebra inside and out, so they gave me this algebra test to take to prove to them that I knew some, and so I did, I to a test, extra test, you took the first one and then you had to take the second one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so you qualified to become a math major?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 26550
Speaker 1: Were there any special teachers at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: I had a teacher called Dr. Geraldine Darden, and I'm in contact with her, even today.  She's no longer at Hampton, of course, but she's retired now.
Speaker 1: Was she a math teacher?
Speaker 2: She was a math teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dr. Darden did things for us in the following way.  She gave us tough love.  She was not the push-over, the this, the that, that you would expect some teachers maybe to be.  She was the type of mentor to say, you need to do this, you need to make sure that you have done your homework.  And a lot of people say don't tell your students the following, but she did tell us, many of you were valedictorians in your classes and salutatorians, okay so look around, you were all valedictorians and salutatorians, so if you want to be here, you going to have to act like you were a valedictorian and salutatorian, you're going to have to do some work.  If you don't do your work, you will not be here next year.  I will not be seeing you because you'll be gone.  This is what she told us the first day.  And it was work, work, and more work.  She was not the kind to back away. She taught us foundations in mathematics and that was one of the hardest courses that we would ever take, because she put teeth in it.  Geraldine Darden, and she's still that way, and in fact, I don't know if you'll ever do him, but she was also mentor to Freeman Hrabowski, president of UMBC [University of Maryland, Baltimore County].
Speaker 1: Now we interviewed him back in 2002, believe it or not.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 2002 or [200]3.
Speaker 2: Then he should have mentioned her name.
Speaker 1: He probably did, it's been a long time ago.  Now did you know someone name Genevieve--
Speaker 2: Knight?
Speaker 1: Knight.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I started at Hampton, I was going to be a mathematics education major.  Dr. Genevieve Knight was the mathematics education advisor.  So I actually started with Dr. Knight and moved to Dr. Darden, because I became a straight math major, not a mathematics education major.  I worked with Dr. Knight with a couple of classes, but I've done more with Dr. Knight after I graduated than while I was at Hampton because she was at Coppin [State University, Baltimore, Maryland].  And we're in the same system, so we worked together in that respect.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you had calculus at Hampton, I guess?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, after I had algebra, geometry, statistics, probability, yes, all of those things.
Speaker 1: And the teachers you're mentioning are women?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: So this is--You know, this central story about American University is about like women not being, you know, held back in math and told they can't do it, but all along the way, your teachers are women.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And black women at that, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, oh, yes, they're black, both of them, Dr. Darden's black.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26551
Speaker 1: So, now what else, did you join a sorority, did you have time to do that?
Speaker 2: I actually did not join a sorority.  I became members of two honor societies.  I became a member of Alpha Kappa Mu National Honor Society, and Beta Kappa Chi.  Alpha Kappa Mu is for all students, you know all majors, Beta Kappa Chi, science, engineering, mathematics.  So I became members of those organizations while I was at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Beta Kappa Chi.
Speaker 2: Beta Kappa Chi.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty special on the black college campuses.  What else, you said you encountered discrimination in your face for the first time at Hampton?
Speaker 2: Well, there were some teachers who didn't feel like we knew as much as they thought we knew.  So it's, I guess you could say, half and half, in a sense that we had some teachers who felt like everything was okay, and you could do this, but we had maybe one or two, now the one that I had, I had a white math teacher who kind of didn't feel like African American women knew as much, but I have to admit, he was international, so some of the international men that we faced have been less than kind, how about that?
Speaker 1: Okay, now Hampton as well as a lot of HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] have, not all the instructors are African American, of course, or African.  There are many teachers from--
Speaker 2: He was Russian.
Speaker 1: --Yeah, from the Eastern Block and some people that came over after World War II and taught at the black colleges--so he was a Russian teacher?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: He did not believe that--
Speaker 2: We, you know, why are you here?  You gonna just get married.  You know if you get a degree, you're gonna just get married, you're not going to do anything with it.  So, yes, little things like that.  I'm like, no.  We're going to do more than just get married.  We're actually going to use this degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you got a cultural goal figure (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: You had more support.  So were you really concerned about that kind of talk?
Speaker 2: I actually wasn't.  And the reason why is my high school people really gave me a good foundation.  They told me, you can do anything, only thing you just continue to do your work.  We did extra work.  We saw them put in extra work for us, so we did extra work.  So since college I've been doing extra work.  So, that did not phase me in the least. Never did I decide that I wasn't going to continue to get my degree or to get a degree after the first one.  I got the first one, the second one, third one, it was not a--fourth one, never was there a deterrent, and HHampHthroughout all of that time, Mr. [James] Blake [Langdon's math teacher in high school] kept in touch and Dr. [Geraldine] Darden [Langdon's math teacher at Hampton University].  Those were the two that were really instrumental.
Story_ID: 26552
Speaker 1: After I got my degree from the College of William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia], I was working at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia], and Dr. [Geraldine] Darden [Langdon's math teacher at Hampton University] came to me one day, and she said, I thought you told me you wanted to do some work in computer science?  And I said I do.  She said I didn't see your name on the list of people asking for faculty development funds that were made available by the president?  And I said I didn't know that there were any.  She said, I'm on the committee, and the applications are due Monday, and I don't have yours.  This was Friday.  She said so, Monday morning, I want your application in the bunch with everybody else's.  So on Monday morning, my application was in the bunch with everybody else's.
Speaker 2: This is after you came out of Hampton, right?
Speaker 1: This is after I was out of Hampton and back, and back.  I was working at Hampton about that time.
Speaker 2: She was still pushing you?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 26553
Speaker 1: Any other significant events at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] before we graduate you?
Speaker 2: This is before I graduated that we're talking?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, I was magna cum laude.
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.  Now is that, I get it mixed up.  I've never been--
Speaker 2: Summa cum is the highest, magna cum and then cum laude.
Speaker 1: All right.  So that's significant.  You told me about some of your activities on campus, but most of what you were doing was studying, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I was doing work.  I did, I mean, the honor society, I did my work with respect to honor societies, I didn't join a sorority, I watched them a lot.  And I did some other things I tutored a little bit while I was on campus.  Dr. [Geraldine] Darden [Langdon's math teacher at Hampton] had some students that she wanted some help with, so I helped her with those, things like that, but most of the work that I did while I was at Hampton was academic.  When I left home to go to college at Hampton, my father [Albert Moody] gave me the following words.  He said you know we live on a farm, and you work on a farm every day.  He said, financially, we're going to do everything we can but this is a degree that you may or may not get, depending on what you do.  So I had a scholarship that I had to keep.  So every year I was told if your grades are okay then you will get your scholarship.  And so I kept my grades up and I got a scholarship every year that I was at Hampton, and I graduated in four years.  So I had a first focus, and the first focus is get the degree, and to get the degree I had to maintain my scholarship, and that was my main focus while I was there.
Story_ID: 26554
Speaker 1: Did Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] offer computer science when you were in school?
Speaker 2: No.  Hampton did not offer computer science as a major while I was there.  We had one course, one for the entire institution.  I mean, and it was a FORTRAN class, and I did take it, but you had to do the following.  We did not have a compiler or an interpreter.  So our work had to be sent to The College of William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia].  William and Mary would process it and send it back, and they did it, of course, when their systems were free.  So, literally, if you wrote a program, you might get feedback from that program a day later, two days later, you fixed the mistakes, you sent it back.  So the HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] did not have their own computers, compilers and interpreters.  We had to depend on the white institution.  And so the marriage between Hampton and [The College of] William and Mary was in place when I took my class.
Story_ID: 26555
Speaker 1: All right, so, you graduated from Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] in 1973.  And was your intent at that point to go on and get a master's degree?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was.  Dr. [Geraldine] Darden [Langdon's math teacher at Hampton] put that seed into my head.  So my intent was to go on and get a master's degree, it was.
Speaker 1: So what did you do immediately after graduation?
Speaker 2: I think I worked--no, no.  I actually went to The College of William and Mary [Williamsburg, Virginia].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now you weren't married or anything by this time, were you?
Speaker 2: I did.  I got married and I went to The College of William and Mary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We don't want to skip over that now.
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: That's a big chapter in everyone's life, getting married.  So, did you meet your husband on campus?
Speaker 2: I met my husband at Hampton, yes I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you go from being--
Speaker 2: Actually, I should say I met my first husband on campus.
Speaker 1: --So this is Mr. Sterling?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  So you went from being a--
Speaker 2: A Moody.  I was initially a Moody.
Speaker 1: A Moody to a--
Speaker 2: Sterling.
Speaker 1: --Sterling.  All right.  So you're married at this point.  So, did you get married before you graduated?
Speaker 2: I got married just before I graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And then you went to College of William and Mary?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  So that's in the same--is it close by?
Speaker 2: Same area.  Oh, yes.  Williamsburg is right up the street from Newport News [Virginia], so I just drove everyday to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what were you pursuing?
Speaker 2: I was pursuing a degree in math.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I got a degree in math--I got a degree in math education.
Speaker 1: This would be a B.S. another B.S.?
Speaker 2: No.  I got a master's.
Speaker 1: Master's, okay.
Speaker 2: I got an M.A. [Master of Arts degree] at the College of William and Mary.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And you got your M.A. in 1977?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Story_ID: 26556
Speaker 1: From what I understand you went on to teach in the York County--
Speaker 2: I taught in York County public schools one year, okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: One year.  And then I left from there and went to Rappahannock Community College [Virginia], and I taught two years.
Speaker 1: Rappahannock on the Tappahannock.
Speaker 2: Rappahannock Community College, taught for them two years.
Speaker 1: So what did you teach?
Speaker 2: I taught business mathematics, and I taught some developmental mathematics and then anything in between that they wanted.  The two main things that I taught were developmental and business mathematics for Rappahannock.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So any stories from that period of time, or, put it this way, did you imagine yourself, you know, achieving a Ph.D. at this period of time?
Speaker 2: No.  When I was at Rappahannock Community College?
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.
Speaker 2: No.  I actually expected that I would just continue working at a community college level or public school, it was going to be one or the other.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one day I started teaching as an adjunct for Hampton [University], and I was doing it for Dr. [Geraldine] Darden [Langdon's math teacher at Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia].  She had a position to open up and the position dealt with--it was a two-part position.  It was the special mathematics laboratory and it was teaching some regular classes.  So it was a two-part position.  I said okay, I'm going to apply for this and I did, and I got it and we ran the laboratory.  I had a small budget and I had student staffers, two student staffers, math majors, to work with me.  But literally, we had students to learn mathematics and we sent the teachers reports on them, who came for tutoring, how well they did, things like that, and then of course I taught a couple of math classes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is 1979, right?  This is where you were supervisor of the mathematics science laboratory?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  I did that at Hampton for Dr. Darden.  She was chair of the department at that time.  She was not chair when I went to Hampton, but she was chair by that time.
Speaker 1: All right, so you did that from '79 (1979) to '82 (1982), right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Story_ID: 26557
Speaker 1: In late '80s (1980s), early '80s (1980s)--late '70s (1970s), early '80s (1980s) computer science starts to change, right?
Speaker 2: And that's when I actually got involved.  I took two classes at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] at the same time.  I decided, you know, I should be able to do this.  So I took those two classes and that's when I said, I can do this.  And that's when Dr. [Geraldine] Darden [Langdon's math teacher at Hampton University] reminded me that we had faculty development money from Dr. [William] Harvey [president of Hampton University] and that I should apply for some.  So I did, and I went to Old Dominion [University, Norfolk, Virginia] as a result of those funds.
Speaker 1: Old Dominion--
Speaker 2: University, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --University in Virginia.  So you started working on a master's degree there?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh in computer science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--about what time period is this?
Speaker 2: Oh, this is right after I left--well close to the time period when I left Rappahannock Community College.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you're going to Old Dominion while you're--
Speaker 2: While I was at Hampton [University].
Speaker 1: --In the science laboratory?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So was there any particular teachers at Old Dominion that kind of helped you, or did any of them try to hurt you?
Speaker 2: Well, helped.  Dr. Moonis Ali.
Speaker 1: Dr. who?
Speaker 2: Moonis Ali.  M-O-O-N-I-S; A-L-I, was his last name, okay.  He was pretty much like Dr. Darden.
Speaker 1: Now where was he from?
Speaker 2: Iran.
Speaker 1: Okay, from Iran, okay.  So he was a good mentor then if he was like Dr. Darden?
Speaker 2: He was like Dr. Darden in a sense that he wanted you to do the work.  You had to work.  If you were going to be in his class, you had to do some work.  In fact, Dr. Darden took computer science classes from Old Dominion, and she had him as an instructor.  So she told me about him.  And he was exactly as she said he wants you to do your work.  He will help you do what he can, but you have to show some initiative.  And so that's what we did.  So I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In what way is this master's degree different from your earlier one?
Speaker 2: The first one, mathematics education allowed me, when I came here [Bowie State University, Bowie, Maryland], jumping ahead just a little bit, I taught mathematics and I was a liaison between mathematics, natural sciences and computer science department and the department of education, so it allowed me to do that.  The computer science degree allowed me to teach computer science classes and to get ready to do--well to create and help write computer science programs, and I don't mean programs in the sense of a programming project, I mean to actually help create programs for the institution.  I helped create the undergraduate program for here, the current one, and the master's program.
Story_ID: 26558
Speaker 1: Well, tell us how computer science is changing those days.
Speaker 2: Well, now you know, we're talking mainframes in those days [late 1970s to early 1980s].
Speaker 1: In the early days, yeah.
Speaker 2: In those early days.  And just at that time, people started using things like dumb terminals, okay?   See, before--I mean, you couldn't have a dumb terminal at your house and then log into the systems at Old Dominion [University, Norfolk, Virginia] during that time period.  You started being able to do that.  Before, you were on a mainframe, you had to drive to the university and do your work, do all of your submissions and everything like that.  You couldn't do anything from home.  Then they started creating the so-called dumb terminal, and the dumb terminal allowed you to dial in, log in, and once you logged in, you could do your work from home, but you had to log into the mainframe.  After that, several years after that the dumb terminal started to become smart.  So, you could actually do some of your work on the actual terminal itself.  But dumb terminals came into existence during that time and initially they were more like teletype machines but then they started to look the way the personal computers look now.
Speaker 1: So they were keyboards, did they have screens.
Speaker 2: The dumb terminals had--they were CRTs [cathode ray tubes], okay.  They look like what they look now.  They had screens and they had keyboards, but the old ones weren't anything but teletype machines.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had a scroll of digital--
Speaker 2: Right, right.  It's just when you typed, it looked like what you would see with a typewriter, the original ones.  But when I was taking my computer science classes is when we got the dumb terminal stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and the size of computers--well, it really started changing now with the terminal development of PCs, right?
Speaker 2: These things were much bigger than what you see now.  They were large.
Speaker 1: The terminals?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, the terminals were large.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was several years later before we went to the client server environment.  When I was there we still had (unclear) machines and when we did graphics, the graphics--floppy disk was something like 10 by 10 or 11 by 11, yes.  When I show it to my students--we have a sample that we show students nowadays, they can't believe it when they see it, but it was pretty much, almost 11 by 11 floppy to go into the machine.
Speaker 1: Now, about the time that you graduated, you graduated with your degree in '85 (1985), right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: About that time, a couple of years before Apple [Incorporater] Computer came out with a little desk top about the size of an inverted bread box, now that one had a small port for a little floppy disk, right?  Did you see one of those at that time?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  We saw them.  But now, remember HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] were a little bit slower and behind in those days.  You didn't get the latest technology as soon as it came out.  Mostly you ran a few years behind, so the majority of schools were able to buy those and use them, but HBCUs we were a little bit slower.
Speaker 1: Did Old Dominion have some?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Old Dominion was actually pretty progressive, okay.  But now you had to be taking particular classes to be able to use them.  Because when I attended Old Dominion, we had the gauntlet of courses, I mean, of machines.  We actually had one course that we used a card-reading machine for, so yes.  So during that time we just went the gauntlet, old stuff to new stuff.

Speaker 1: You got this master's degree in computer science from Old Dominion [University, Norfolk, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: This is 1985, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So, what did you do--okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I was at Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia].
Speaker 1: All right, you were working at Hampton?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: How did you find out about the program at American University [Washington, District of Columbia]?
Speaker 2: I had a friend who was working at Hampton [University], she was a chemistry teacher, she lived in Washington, D.C. [District of Columbia], but she came to Hampton and lived five days a week and went back to Washington, D.C. to her apartment on weekends.  She said to me one day, you know, they have this program at the American University where they will give you money through the Patricia Harris Roberts Fellowship to work on a doctorate degree.  And she talked to me about it and she had a friend there who she worked with in the D.C. public schools.  So she told me about it, I called the friend and talked to her about it, because the friend started it, but the friend was older and really wasn't interested in completing it, but she had gotten all of the details.  So I heard about it, I listened, I thought about it for a while, and then one Saturday morning, I called Linda Hayden [also a HistoryMaker].  Linda and I had met a few years before that when we both attended a conference in North Carolina.  North Carolina A and T [Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] were sponsoring the conference.  It was for us to learn (unclear) through the federal government, a special program.  So I called Linda that morning, it was like six o'clock in the morning, and I told her about the program, and I said, "Do you want to go, do you want me to make arrangements?"  And she said, "Yes."  But she was asleep, sleeping.  So she called me back about an hour and a half later, and she said, "Tell me again what you told me when you called me earlier this morning."  So I told her.  She said, "Why are you messing with my head like this, why are you bothering me, why do you do this to me, because I'm thinking about this."  So I said because I can't go by myself.  So she hung up again and then a little bit later, I don't whether it was the same day or days later, she called me again.  So I made arrangements to go and meet with Mary Gray.  So she and I drove to Washington, D.C., and we met with Mary Gray, who was in charge of the program at the American University.  The rest is history.  We got the fellowships and graduated with the degrees and Linda was living, of course, in Portsmouth [Virginia], I think, and she was commuting back and forth.  So after she got the degree, she started working at Elizabeth City State [University, Elizabeth City, North Carolina], she worked for them two days a week.  And I started working for Bowie State University.
Story_ID: 26560
Speaker 1: I guess the remarkable thing about this is that I think it was four or five black women pursuing a Ph.D. at American University the same time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Did everyone have a petition--
Speaker 2: A Patricia Roberts, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Roberts Harris Fellowship?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes, we did.
Speaker 1: Why American University?
Speaker 2: The people, Mary Gray and Nina Roscher, Dr. Nina Roscher--
Speaker 1: Those were two white women?
Speaker 2: Two white women wrote a grant to get it to support African Americans getting the degree, and we applied.  Now, actually, I take it back, not so much African Americans as women.  They wanted women, but they focused on African American females, because they wanted to increase the number of African American females with terminal degrees.
Speaker 1: What were those numbers like, do you remember.  It's time to talk about that on some level, because I know that there are stats [statistics] that we had that I think only were 2 percent of the graduates or less than that--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: --I mean of people achieving Ph.D.s around that time period were African American women.
Speaker 2: It was low, it was extremely low.  I don't remember the percents, but it was low.
Speaker 1: Lower than even black men, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Yes, because we didn't go into science engineering mathematics.
Speaker 1: So the number of black women graduating, I think what I remember was almost half that of black men?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And black men was maybe a twentieth of white women, or something.
Speaker 2: They were low, they were low.  They were trying to increase our numbers and Nina Roscher and Mary Gray pushed, okay.  And you talk about stories.  I'll tell you just a little story.  During that time period my father [Albert Moody] became ill, and I said to Dr. Gray that I wanted to go home and see him.  I was working on my dissertation.  She said he'll want to see you when you finish your degree, he doesn't want to see you now.  So, in essence, your father is not so ill until he's in emergency.  Finish your dissertation so that he can see you walk across the stage.  That was her message to me.  And she was right, he was not at the stage where I really needed to go and see him, it's just that when I heard that he was ill, I hadn't seen him for a while, I wanted to go home and check on him.  She said check on him after you have your degree.  So that's what I did, I didn't go home.  I finished writing my dissertation so that I could graduate.  And when I did my sister wanted to put my picture in the paper in South Carolina, I told you, it comes out once a week.  She wanted to put my picture there, and she wanted a bio.  So I sent it and my father [Arthur Moody] now tells this story.  It was in the paper and many of the white members of the community that he worked with on the farm came up to him and said was your daughter's picture in the paper Wednesday?  He said why do you ask?  He said there's somebody in the newspaper that looks just like you, and they talk about the fact that she just got terminal degree from--and they named the school.  So, of course, he then, he felt really good.  So I went back and I told this to Dr. Gray.  I said, you were right, I said he was really, really happy and he has been having a lot of fun with the fact that I have a degree and it's in the newspaper, so you were right to tell me to finish my degree and go and see him after I have my degree, because he'd be happier.
Speaker 1: Well, he's probably happy with the other two degrees, but this is a Ph.D., right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Or the other three degrees.
Speaker 2: Right, he was.
Speaker 1: This is a Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So, how many people in Marion [South Carolina] have a Ph.D. or from Marion have a Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: During that time period, very few, very few.  And so he was. He really enjoyed the fact that his daughter had a Ph.D.  And the people that he had worked with and for all of his life had daughters who had degrees, but nobody had a Ph.D., majority or minority.  So, he was really, really happy.  And she, of course, laughed a lot.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26561
Speaker 1: All right, so Mary Gray, she went on to become the president of Amnesty International--of the board of Amnesty International at some point.
Speaker 2: Well, she was working with them during that time period.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (simultaneous) Socially reform personality and she--
Speaker 2: She was working with them during that time.  She had some work with the federal government and she was a female achiever, achiever because she had her degree in mathematics but then she went back and got her degree in law and started working with Amnesty International long before she became president of the organization.  She worked with people like Hanan Ashrawi [Palestinian legislator, activist and scholar], you know, Palestinian, who was there when [Yasser] Arafat [Palestinian leader] was there, that kind of thing.  And of course as an overachieving female, she treated us like we needed to be overachieving females.  When I was writing the dissertation, she was flying back and forth and doing some work and she had to go to London [England].  She told me send me the information that I need to read on your behalf.  And it was not a thing where I could e-mail it to her, e-mail was not prominent then.  I overnighted it to LondonayH so she could read it and then she read my--that part of my dissertation, put her comments in and sent it back to me by mail.  So even then it wasn't a thing where it could be as quickly as email, but as far as the mail could overnight from there to here, she and I exchanged parts of my dissertation through that time period.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She helped to keep everyone on point?
Speaker 2: She did.  She was the person to keep us on point.
Speaker 1: Another part of this story that's remarkable is the number, as I said in the beginning, the number of African American women achieving their Ph.D. at the same time, because you got--
Speaker 2: Around about the same time, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: --Around 1989 I think three of you did it, I think two got it in '88 (1988), right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Martha, Elaine, Linda.
Speaker 1: Elaine Smith, Martha Brown, Linda Hayden, Ann Taylor and yourself, right?  And one of them in a piece that we have in our outline says that she--it was the camaraderie with the rest of you that really made a difference, too.
Speaker 2: Oh, it did.  We worked together, we talked to each other.  I mean and it lasted beyond what we did at American University.  We still kind of kept up, even though we might not have been talking to each other, one of us will tell the other what was happening, who was doing what and who was moving forward, so we did.  And while we were there, we were together a lot.
Speaker 1: Now this is not the usual experience that African Americans have in graduate school, working on a Ph.D. from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Usually we're loners.
Speaker 1: Yes.  You're the only one there and then somebody might help you?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Whereas the white students have a study group?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Someone might tell you what the assignment was or wasn't, they might.
Speaker 2: Right. But we were there to actually be able to support each other and do the same thing that they normally do.  And they will tell you, the literature tells you.  African Americans don't tend to do that, or they didn't not at that time, they didn't do that.  You studied alone, you tried to learn and do alone.  Then we had somebody that we could actually talk to. I think we created a notebook of when we're studying for the comps [comprehensive exams], I was working as--we worked out problems, or as I worked our problems I created a notebook.  So as everybody worked on answers and problems, we put together a notebook so you could actually look in the notes--so when you had a question and you weren't in (unclear), so we were contributors and somebody looked in the notebook, looked in the notebook.  The notebook became a really good resource.  So when we left, it actually passed on to the students who were coming after us to help them with the answers to comp questions for that time period in the math department at American [University].
Speaker 1: Is really different from what had happened before, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Having so any of you there and then the interaction between you is really different.  Now the work, for the record, was hard.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: The work was hard.
Speaker 2: Mary Gray was hard.  Mary Gray is like Geraldine Darden [Langdon's math teacher at Hampton University].  I told you, she said, go see your father [Albert Moody] after you have your degree, I mean, that was her attitude about the work too, here you need to do this.  You don't have time to go home.  You don't have time to do anything.  You have work to do.
Story_ID: 26562
Speaker 1: Now, at the time, did you have children?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Yes, I had children.  I dropped them off at school as I went to my class every day, I mean as I went to the American University [Washington, District of Columbia] every day.  In fact, my youngest was born while I was in graduate school at American, and I hired a babysitter at American, she met me in the mornings, I taught--each of us taught a class and mine was first thing in the morning, like eight o'clock.  I hired one of the students to babysit.  I took my youngest with me.  She had a stroller that turned into a bed and all of that stuff.  I would leave her with the babysitter for the hour or so that I was in class, I would go teach my class and then I was in the office for the rest of the day doing my own work.  And so, yes, I did that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, did you have a helpful husband at home during this period of time?
Speaker 2: I had a husband who wasn't a hindrance, that's a better thing.  He helped hire someone to come in and help with the housework and all of that stuff.  He couldn't help a lot, but he was willing to pay to have somebody come in and do that to help me.
Speaker 1: So, was this the first one or is this the second?
Speaker 2: This is the second husband.
Speaker 1: Second, okay.
Speaker 2: Second Husband.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is Mr. Langdon.
Speaker 2: Yes, he paid somebody to come in and help me so that I could get my work done and give attention and time to the kids, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26563
Speaker 1: So 1989. Anything else about that experience [at American University, Washington, District of Columbia].  It's been written about, and I've heard about it.
Speaker 2: They put an article out there.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a whole article, a couple of articles.  What happened, were you the only class like this?
Speaker 2: From what I could tell--
Speaker 1: Got these fellowships?
Speaker 2: --Yes.  Now she [Mary Gray] did--they had the Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship for a period of time after that, but I don't think she had a group of people like us after that.  She didn't bring in a group.  She had a few males, I mean, well a few males, not Mary Gray, but I mean, a couple of males went to American [University] and took advantage of the Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship, but there was not a group like the group that we were in to actually go through and earn degrees during that time period.  We were their best crop.
Speaker 1: And the first group, too.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: So what happened?  Was the money not available?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Just wasn't available?
Speaker 2: Scholarship money, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Maybe somebody else will pick this up at some point or figure out a way to replicate it.
Speaker 2: Right, because it really worked.  The women actually did it and thrived.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26564
Speaker 1: So next big question here is what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: Actually, I wrote programs.  I tied computer science to my mathematics, and we were trying to determine whether students would do better if they had mathematics tied to the computer programs that they had to use, and it was for probability students.  So I wrote probability programs for them to use in the probability classes to help them learn, and we gave certain questions on the tests to see whether the programs actually made it better in their classes.  So I actually wrote a craps program, as you would call it.  It had random number generator and it did the dice the way that people play dice, did a black jacking, those things, you know, they do lots of probability with cards and they do lots of probability with dice.  So I wrote card games and dice games for the students in the statistics and probability classes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you find that it was helpful?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They actually showed that the students did better on those questions.  The students who did the programs who actually used them did better on those questions than the students who didn't.  You know, you have to have a control group and a group that uses the programs.  So the students who used the programs did better, significantly better.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How did students feel about doing kind of extra work for you?
Speaker 2: You know, we didn't have any--we had no issues or problems.  Some of the students--the classes were being taught by--well, there's always a professor, but you know, large school have [teaching] assistants teaching your classes so the students worked with the assistants, and the assistants always give them extra work, because that's  how--I think the sessions are called recitation sessions.  So doing the recitation sessions is when they use the programs.  And so it wasn't considered extra work, it was actually considered work to help them pass their classes like they would normally go to a recitation session.
Speaker 1: I think one of the goals was to get students to understand the use of simulations?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we presented, and when I say we, I mean Dr. [Mary] Gray and I, presented at a campus conference, on this particular thing, and we demonstrated the programs so they could see what was going on, but yes, it was to help them get a better understanding and it showed that it did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you found that in those days something that most people take for granted now is that computer software can be affective, a teaching tool?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then we had to write it from scratch.  It was not one of these things where you could just go and buy if off the shelf.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But still, in those days, we have this situation where there's twice as many African American men getting Ph.D.s and forty times the number of white women getting Ph.D.s and almost 200 times as many white men getting Ph.D.s at the same time that you got yours.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  So whatever they were doing, worked.
Story_ID: 26565
Speaker 1: So you went back to Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Oh, you mean to teach?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: After the American [University, Washington, District of Columbia], no, I came here.  After I got married, I was living in this area with my husband, so I came here [Bowie State University, Bowie, Maryland].  They had a job opening, I applied.  And at that time, they didn't have any African American Ph.D.s in the department, females.  They had no African American female Ph.D.s.  They had males but no African American females.  You know that's interesting.  I just realized that.
Speaker 1: Well, tell us a little bit about Bowie State?
Speaker 2: At that time?
Speaker 1: Well, at that time, but you know even back a little further like where did Bowie State come from? It's a (unclear) notable HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We're a normal school then a teacher's college.
Speaker 1: Normal school, when was this, turn of the century or something?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh 1865 when it first started.
Speaker 1: All right.  1865, that's right after the civil war?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh, I think that's when it came into existence, 1865.  We're one of the oldest HBCUs in the whole nation, okay.  And when they became--well, they were a teacher's college.  And when they became a liberal arts college, because you know, they went from teachers to liberal arts.  And then I think I still know some of the people who graduated when it was a teacher's college, and after it became a liberal arts college, they come back, the alums come back and they talk to us about how they worked in the cafeteria, how they worked in the dorms and that's how they actually went through college.  They worked at Bowie State University and because they were allowed to work, they could pay their tuition and fees and they could graduate.
Speaker 1: There's a model that Hampton has and Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama], a lot of schools have that model.
Speaker 2: Tuskegee being the best model for that.
Speaker 1: Right.  What was the state of Bowie's when you got here.  Is it mostly a commuter campus or is it a--
Speaker 2: We're mostly a commuter campus.  When I arrived, one third of the students stayed on campus, the other students did not, in fact, actually, less than a third.  We had a third graduate students and then less than a third stayed on campus.  We had about 700 or so students that actually lived on campus when I came.  We have actually put in at least two residence halls, I mean, opened them since I've been here.  The latest of course being Crystal McCauliffe, you know, the gigantic one that you passed as you came in.
Speaker 1: Okay, who is Christine McCauliffe?
Speaker 2: Crystal McCauliffe?  A Bowie State University master's graduate who was a female educator from the area, and of course, she was chosen to go into space and the shuttle that she was on exploded.  So they named the residence hall in her honor.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just wanted to get that.
Speaker 2: The teacher who went into space, who lost her life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26566
Speaker 1: Was Bowie [State University, Bowie, Maryland] focused on STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics] education when you started here?
Speaker 2: Bowie was I would say in transition, moving towards STEM education.  At that time, computer science and the sciences were becoming more and more prominent.  So when they were hiring, they were trying to do something about the fact that natural science and computer science and mathematics were all housed together in one unit.  And they wanted to change that.  We had a master's [degree] in computer science and we had a bachelor's [degree] in computer science.  So, the aim was to do more with computer science and to do more with mathematics.  I was able to provide them with an instructor in two areas, actually three areas.  I could teach regular mathematics, I could teach computer science and I could teach the education classes.  So that's what I did, I taught in all three of those at one time or another during my first two to three years.
Speaker 1: You were also director of something called the SIECA Program, S-I-E-C-A.
Speaker 2: Summer Institute in Engineering and Computer Applications Program, yes.  The university had a partnership with [NASA; National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Goddard Space Flight Center since 1972 and that partnership involved us, namely, Bowie State University doing the leg work, finding students, minority students, who would be good for the space program.  They would give us grants and aid to train them, so we brought them in during the summertime and Bowie State University found housing for them, provided a director and Goddard mentors worked with them.  So we would bring in initially about fifteen students each summer.  And while I had the program we changed it and expanded it so that it included the graduate students.  We moved to about twenty-five students, fifteen undergraduates, ten graduates.  They majored in mathematics, computer science, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and physics.  Those are the areas that Goddard Space Flight Center needs for the work that they do in flight, and those are the types of students that we brought in.  The claim was that they were having a really hard time diversifying their workforce, and so this program's main focus was to bring in students who could do the work that they needed but who were diverse.  So we expanded it to include Hispanics, as well, so African Americans and Hispanics.
Story_ID: 26567
Speaker 1: The program, the SIECA [Summer Institute in Engineering and Computer Applications program] is one of the reasons why I received the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] Diversity Award that is mentioned in my resume.  One day I got a phone call from the EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity] director at the time and she said we want to give you an award for contributing to the diversity of the [NASA] Goddard [Space Flight Center] workforce.  And I said, you do, and she said, yes.  She said when NASA asked for nominations, I nominated you and they accepted the nomination.  The SIECA program is responsible for a significant number of the science, engineering, mathematics minorities who are working at Goddard Space Flight Center, even today.  We kept track and about forty-five of the people that they have working there are there because of the SIECA program.  No other program that they've had has provided that many minorities for the workforce.  So, it was really a very good program for them and their workforce.
Story_ID: 26568
Speaker 1: In 1990 you were also--you were placed on the Chancellor's Committee in Mathematics and Science, right?
Speaker 2: When I came to Bowie State University [Bowie, Maryland], the chancellor was interested in improving mathematics in this university system of Maryland.  So, he created this commission, and he asked each of the institutions in the system to provide a representative.  So, Dr. [James] Lyons, who was our president at that time, put me on the commission for Bowie State University.  We met at UMBC [University of Maryland, Baltimore County] and it was initially chaired by Freeman Hrabowski.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So it sounds like it might have been a strong committee?
Speaker 2: It was.  We had a wide variety of mathematicians, etcetera.  And one of the things that we did was provide opportunities for individuals from the various schools in the area to do mathematics at a college or university in the system.  And the teachers were supposed to then take back what they did in the summers to their schools and use it in their classrooms.  It was to improve the mathematics that they were teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, they actually did things during the summer, they put in the applications and we chose based on references, etcetera and the criteria and then they worked during the summers and then went back for implementations during the year.
Story_ID: 26569
Speaker 1: Okay, now is this different from the Maryland Collaborative for Teacher Preparation?
Speaker 2: That actually grew out of--The Maryland Collaborative was an NSF [National Science Foundation] grant sponsored entity, and it overlapped with the governor's commission.  The governor was really, really interested in--this is [William] Schaefer--increasing mathematics usage and of course there was always a weakness.  There are people who feel like they can't do math.  So the aim was to change that.  The collaborative was an NSF grant written by two main faculty members at [University of Maryland] College Park, but it included partnerships with everybody in the system.  And what we were supposed to do was expand on the idea of the governor's commission and include as many teachers as possible in the collaborative, working with them to promote mathematics teaching in the entire state, which we did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was a Maryland Collaborative which was 1992 to '96 (1996).
Story_ID: 26570
Speaker 1: Now in '93 (1993), now, were you--now you started off as an assistant professor, or did you--
Speaker 2: When I came to Bowie [State University, Bowie, Maryland], I came as an associate professor.
Speaker 1: --Associate professor, okay.
Speaker 2: I started as an associate.
Speaker 1: So did you become a full professor in '93 (1993)?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  That's what I thought this meant, but I wasn't quite sure.
Speaker 2: Full professor.
Speaker 1: During your career have you been involved in some of the, I have a note here about NAM the National Association of Mathematicians had its first African American woman lecture in 1992.  It seems odd that that would be that long before that happened, but were you a member of NAM?
Speaker 2: I was a member of MAA, not that and a member of the--that the Mathematics Association of America and American Mathematics something, I can't think of the--
Speaker 1: Is it AMA, American Mathematics Association?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  So I've been members of those two things.  I've not been a member of NAM.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And there's an African Mathematical Association as well, called the African Mathematical Union Commission on Women in Mathematics, do you know anything about that?
Speaker 2: I know about it, but I've never been a member.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I should.  I haven't done that.
Speaker 1: A lady name Grace Alele-Williams is involved in that.  That was (unclear).  I decided to ask you, I didn't know if it had any significance, but are there meetings of African American women in math?
Speaker 2: Do they hold them?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.
Speaker 1: Is there an organization?
Speaker 2: There is an organization.  I just am not a member.
Story_ID: 26571
Speaker 1: And I shouldn't, well, maybe I shouldn't say this but when you work at a small school, there's only so much.
Speaker 2: In terms of resources, you mean to attend these meetings?
Speaker 1: But also time.  Many people don't realize the difference between the workload at a small school, especially HBCU [historically black colleges and universities] slash, you know, small school slash HBCU and a majority school.  So at a majority school, you may teach one course a semester or two courses a semester and then you do all of your other duties.  At small schools and HBCUs you teach twelve credits, which is four classes, typically, you hold--
Speaker 2: This is per--
Speaker 1: --Semester.
Speaker 2: --Semester.  Four classes?
Speaker 1: Four classes.  You hold eight hours of office hours, you do all of your committee work.  So what committees are you likely to be on, curriculum committee, policy and standards committee, rank and tenure, and those are standing committees.  And then there are others that come up.  So middle states happens in this full cycle every ten years, but then there's a mid report, which is due every five years and then ABET [Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology], we are ABET accredited.  So you're on several subcommittees for ABET is the accrediting association for engineers, computer scientists, etc.  So you serve on those committees as well.  And then you serve on system committees.  I have been on the Council of University System Faculty for several years.  Just recently I was on the (unclear) committee for the system for a special project, I was on the system task force to look at salaries for all faculty several years ago and a couple of other system committees.  So your professional organizations, you make some choices.  So the ones that are the most far-reaching, especially for your curriculum, are the one that you tend to choose, like we have a fairly--and you have to do service, okay.  So we do science fairs for the community colleges and for high schools.  We may hold tutoring sessions for students who come in and I don't mean Bowie State University students, I mean for external students for special outreach activities, you do that.  You also write grants.  The SIECA grant is not the only grant that I've had.  I had a Minority Science and Engineering [Improvement Program] grant, MSEIP, where you again try to improve their knowledge in mathematics, but you also try to improve their skills for writing and reading, simultaneously.  And I've worked with several other grants in the department where I've been an associate PI [principal investigator] and things like that.  And I'm not the only one that does that, I'm saying this is the twelve credits and the eight office hours--hours of office hours and various other duties, everybody has to have a workload which includes teaching, research class scholarship and service.  And so at the smaller schools that takes a lot of time.
Speaker 2: I imagine it's not much time for research.
Speaker 1: You know what you do, you do it on weekends.  You write your grants and you do your research on weekends and at night.  They like to say, your white collar worker, so there are no weekends and there are no nights, but we can't really use that because we would never be able to write a grant if we didn't do it on nights and weekends.  We would never be able to do research if--so the amount that we do typically done weekends and we do it during the summertime.  Summertime is prime time for us to actually put in research time.
Speaker 2: Wow, so that's in addition to mentoring summer groups?
Speaker 1: Oh my goodness, yes, I mean, and keeping up with students.  I had a student say, "Dr. Langdon, could you give me some extra work over the summer, because I want to stay prepared for the year."  Another one said, "I want to get prepared for the year."  So we do mentoring activities summer long as well.  And they just show up at your office, by the way.  They don't call and ask for an appointment, they just show up.  And you help them.

Speaker 1: Now you became interim dean of the School of Arts and Sciences in 1996, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What happened?  Was there a dean already.
Speaker 2: No.  The school came into existence at that time.
Speaker 1: Now I thought this was odd, but maybe it's not, but I thought that there would already be a School of Arts and Sciences here.
Speaker 2: Bowie State University [Bowie, Maryland] had a structure such that its departments reported to the provost.  When Nathanael Pollard became our president, he said, we need to get a school structure.  So one of the accomplishments of his presidency was to change Bowie State University structure and make it a school structure.
Speaker 1: School structure meaning that--
Speaker 2: You put the departments together such that the departments that are related are placed in a single unit.  So at the time that Dr. Pollard was here, we had two units to form, College of Arts and Sciences, College of Professional Studies.  And I helped the creation of the College of Arts and Sciences.
Speaker 1: Okay, so as interim dean, you were really creating them, the structure for the College of Arts and Sciences?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And this seems to be, and you become the founding dean in--
Speaker 2: It means I became the permanent dean the next year.
Speaker 1: --In 1997, right.  And you stayed in that position until 2001, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26573
Speaker 1: What I noticed as a pattern looking at your information that you seemed to be good at structuring things and writing manuals and procedures, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've done that a few times.
Speaker 1: All right.  You supported what's been called the 'Writing Across the Curriculum' initiative, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell us about that?
Speaker 2: Well, now, the university [Bowie State University, Bowie, Maryland] has had off and on, a 'writing across the curriculum' initiative just as a yearly generic thing.  But you really have to push it if it's going to happen.  So writing across the curriculum means that you incorporate writing into a variety of courses for every major.  You don't just do it in the English department, and that's what people were saying, it ought to be in the English department.  We made writing across the curriculum, I did, and it has stayed in place in every department, so in almost every course, actually.  So when a faculty member comes, let's say, to the point of getting rank and tenure, namely you want to be tenured or you want to move from one rank to the other, part of the evaluation actually speaks to what did you do to support writing across the curriculum?  So they produce papers and other things that their students have actually written in assignments that they have given in various courses to show that they support the writing across the curriculum activity that's been going on here and needs to continue, because students, especially now, need to do more than they used to, because texting they forget how to spell and you know, they want to write the way that they text and we're saying, no, you can't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26574
Speaker 1: Now you supervised eight department chairs, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now was military science in addition to the eight or was it included?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was one of the eight, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right, and four direct staff members.
Speaker 2: Actually, military science was an interesting--I had military science and I had the band.  So if you talk about interesting things, one day--the military science department used to report to the provost and the band reported to the provost and to fine and performing arts.  Dr. [Nathanael] Pollard [president of Bowie State University, Bowie, Maryland] came in, he said to me--he called me to his office one day and he said, "Dean, I'm going to give you military science and the band."  Now, I'm College of Arts and Sciences, okay.  So, what do you tell your president?  You say okay.  So I went out and I did some crash courses.  So I did a crash course in military sciences and I did crash in band.  And what I mean by crash course in band, I brought in, along with the help of our director for auxiliary services, the band director from Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia] at that time, because Howard had one of the best bands, I visited Delaware State [University, Dover, Delaware] because at that time, they had one of the best bands, and I did a lot of writing and reading of band plans.  And then I went out and hired a new band director and we put a band plan in place.  ROTC, we looked at what they had and what should happen and we rewrote the plan for ROTC.  We used to be a part of Howard University, but we were able to separate and become our own ROTC [Reserve Officers' Training Corps] unit after I started working with them, and that's why I have a ROTC Award, as you can see.
Story_ID: 26575
Speaker 1: And you also wrote handbooks, manuals, brochures, procedures and new policies?
Speaker 2: When I became director--I became interim director for the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs.  It was called Federal Research, I think, at the time.  We changed the name--because we restructured.  I restructured and changed the name, and I became the director for Title III [programs] and so we restructured that as well.  But we needed some policies, procedures and forms and all of those things, and we did not have manuals for any of them, but we needed something for the faculty to be able to follow.  So I set down and I did some research, and I looked at what other schools had in their manuals, and what I did was I didn't reinvent the wheel, I actually used information that would fit Bowie State University [Bowie, Maryland] and I chose the best information from each one.  I put together a manual for the Office of Research and Sponsored Programs and the same thing was done for Title III, not only a manual for faculty, but we also created an operations manual because we didn't have one.  And I told you before, I'm a policy and procedures person and I'm getting ready--the conference that I went to last week gave me some more information.  We're getting ready to revise some manuals based on the information that we received at the conference last week.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, yes, I'm a real stickler for policies and procedures.  That's one of the things people call me for, even people who don't like me, call me, and will say, what's the policy on this or where can I find the policy on this or does the system have a policy for it, and I'm able to answer the questions.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you edited the graduate handbook too.  That's another like a procedural--
Speaker 2: Yes.  Wrote and edited the graduate handbook.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many graduate, I guess, areas are they?
Speaker 2: For us in this department?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: We have two.  We have a master's in computer science and we have a doctor of science in computer science in the department.
Speaker 1: All right.  And across the board, the school has or how many terminal degrees does the school offer?
Speaker 2: Two.  We offer one in education and one in computer science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I think we have approximately thirty-four master's degrees.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 26576
Speaker 1: Back to NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] for a minute.  Tell us about the NASA Women in Science and Engineering [program]?
Speaker 2: Now, that's WISE.
Speaker 1: That's WISE, right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Well, I didn't start WISE but I used to take care of WISE.  As the director for the summer institute [SIECA; Summer Institute in Engineering and Computer Applications Program], I went in and I worked with the EEO [Equal Employment Opportunity] office.  The EEO office sponsored a variety of programs.  The Women and Science Program was sponsored by Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And so what I did during the summers was serve as the director for the Women and Science Program.  They came in and, primarily Spelman's people, at that time, came in as mathematicians.  So they would come in and they would work with the mathematicians.  Some of the them would do some work with the engineers, but the Women and Science Program pushes and supports women who are going to be mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and Spelman had a grant from NASA to do that.  And so I was their summer director.
Speaker 1: Okay, just for one summer?
Speaker 2: No, every summer pretty much.  Spelman didn't send anybody to Goddard [Space Flight Center] to take care of the students, so--
Speaker 1: This is the beginning of 2003?
Speaker 2: --No.  This is the whole time that I was a summer institute person excepting for two years, the initial two years, I took care of the WISE program, Morehouse had a program, I took care of the students from Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Lincoln University in Pennsylvania had a program, LASER, took care of them, Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia] had a graduate program, I took care of them, Gallaudet [University, Washington, D.C.] had a program, I worked with some of their people.  They sent a director, I only took care of them when the director wasn't around and I helped the other--there were several other baby programs.  We had some programs for several areas with disabilities.  There was a program sponsored by the National Association of the Blind, but they didn't send a director so I took care of them.  I actually gained experience on how to work with students with disabilities who had hearing impairments and sight impairments and then other physical impairments as a part of my summer institute duties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26577
Speaker 1: Tell us what you did as director of Title III programs here [Bowie State University, Bowie, Maryland].  Now does this start in 2006 or is this like, okay?
Speaker 2: This is 2006.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We--as you know all HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities] are a part of the Title III Entitlement Program.  So every institution gets an award from the [U.S.] Department of Education [DOE].  What we have to do is we have to get some activities to say what we're going to do with those funds to help strengthen the university.  One of the main things that we do is through the Division of Information Technology and then we support our counseling program, I mean, we're not counseling, we take care of the students through students affairs.  And we have some other assessments and things like that, you know, to make the university better as far as making sure that what we're doing works.  So, but we have a variety.  What I do is I make sure that we use the money the way that the activity say that we're going to use the money.  So if you were working and you say I want to travel to this event for HBCUs.  I say to you, you got to send me the program's itinerary and then you got to tell me how this supports the activity that you're in charge of because if the travel doesn't support the activity that you're in charge of then you can't go.  So I try to make sure that the university's money is used in a way that we said we're going to use it and it actually strengthens.  So if you said to me the laboratory in CLT [Center for Learning Technology] in Room 122 has eighteen computers and seventeen of the eighteen really don't work anymore, they're seven years old, the software's outdated, the computer's are having problems, how can you help me.  Then I sit down and I have a talk with the provost, that's Dr. Weldon Jackson, and I give him the information that you've given to me, explain to him what's going on with that laboratory and, typically, he would say, okay, let's support that change, let's fix that, because we want the students to be able to do their work.  And if you go to him with an activity, something that's needed for the campus, he'll come to me, but it's to make sure--I make sure that the university is following policy and procedure with the usage of our Title III funds.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Also in 2006 you were acting director of the office of research and sponsored programs?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  Our director retired and they needed--I've been writing grants, as you can see, I've had the SIECA [Summer Institute in Engineering and Computer Applications Program] grant for a long time.  So, they needed somebody who could do that job on a temporary basis. I'll tell you a little story.  I was only supposed to have it for three months, okay.  When they asked me to do it, I was supposed to do it for three months while they searched to find someone.  So I said, well sure for three months I can do this.  And then if you will remember we had some budget issues with the state and with the federal government.  So we lost some funding.  So since we lost funding, we couldn't hire somebody as soon as we thought.  So they said could you keep this for another year?  And then we'll hire somebody.  But that kind of didn't happen either because the budget didn't get any better.  So can you keep it for another year?  So it was another year and another year, and so I ended up keeping it as long as I had it.  But what we do in that office is encourage faculty members to write grants and give them the support that they need.  So that's what we did and that's where a couple of the manuals were.  We wrote the manuals so that the faculty members could see the things that they needed to do and we created some forms to make life easier so that they could just fill out the forms and get the signatures that they needed.  So for that office, the goal was to increase the number of grants so that the grants could strengthen the university, research dollars and direct cost dollars, those kinds of things, and we were fairly successful.  I think by the second year, we increased the number of grants form--submissions from forty-two to seventy-nine and we went on to increase it to ninety.
Story_ID: 26578
Speaker 1: All right.  So in terms of grants, I guess, what is the major source of grants for Bowie State [University, Bowie, Maryland], in terms of research?
Speaker 2: We have several grants from NSF [National Science Foundation].  That is--now that tells you many of the grants are written in the Department of Computer Science, okay.  The most prolific grant writer on campus is right here on the campus is a member of the Department of Computer Science.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Department of Natural Sciences writes grants.  They get many of their grants from NIH [National Institutes of Health], I mean they work with them.  They also work in partnerships with various colleges and universities.  We have several grants from schools in the system.  So Towson [University, Baltimore County, Maryland] and [University of Maryland] College Park are two of the schools that we collaborate with fairly often.  So I would say NSF and then system-wise, Towson and College Park are our partners.  And then we have a few individual partners that we work with.
Speaker 1: The University of Maryland at College Park, the big ones and Towson State University [Towson University]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  NSF is our first and foremost grantor.  We have a few with the U.S. Department of Education [DOE].
Story_ID: 26579
Speaker 1: Do you have--have you been able to kind of replicate what happened at American University [Washington, District of Columbia] in your computer science department in terms of the Ph.D. candidates trying to find, you know, bright people and put them together as candidates at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yes, and no.  This department with its doctor of science degree has a U.S. Department of Education [DOE] Title III grant called HBGI, okay, that's Historic Black Graduate Institution, okay.  And we, of course, supported by Congress, we wrote that activity and grant to support students to get terminal degrees in computer science.  We have males and females.  Now you can't discriminate because we're a college and university, we have to take the individuals who qualify and who meet the criteria.  But the primary recipients at this time are African American males and females.  We have, as recipients, nine students at this point and time.
Speaker 1: These are nine Ph.D. candidates?
Speaker 2: These are nine Ph.D. students/candidates.  Some of them are at the student stage, some of them are at the candidate stage.  We have created space for them to be together and work together.  So we set aside a room just for that and it's right across the hall.  We give them the opportunity to work together, we give them the opportunities to travel to conferences, the mentor work with them, faculty mentors, work with them, get them ready for poster presentations and oral presentations--paper presentations at these conferences.  And we support them financially.  We give them the opportunity to come to school and not work.  Coming to school is their work.  We expect to see them every day, five days a week, working on their courses.  That's what we have put in place for our doctor of science students, to get them to the stage where they can graduate.  Those are our full time people, people who can only come part time because they work, we support with tuition support, tuition and fees, again, pushing them towards terminal degrees in computer science.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How many Ph.D.s have you produced in computer science here at Bowie [State University, Bowie, Maryland] to date?
Speaker 2: Three.  Now the program hasn't been in place that long, but some people came to us with master's degrees already, but we actually allowed to enter the program, they can finish their bachelor's and then enter the program and go through all of the course work, all of the master's and the doctoral work, but so far we've produced three.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26580
Speaker 1: It seems as in terms of titles you've cut back on some of your administrative duties and doing more teaching now, is that true or not?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I did the same amount of teaching before as I do now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I had all the titles but I still taught.  I'm old.  It's time for other people to do stuff.  I've been doing things since I came to Bowie State University [Bowie, Maryland] in 1989.  I've been, you talk about when I became a professor, back up a couple of years when I became tenured, I started participating in chair [unclear] governance, so as a tenured person, so I've been chair of the faculty senate, I've been vice chair of the faculty senate, I've chaired various other committees at one time on this campus.  You could say I was a member of about sixteen different committee.  And just to give you a little short story about committee work, I received--we were going to create the University College of Excellence, that's undergraduate, two year program to support freshman and sophomore students, so to make sure that they get what they need and to retain them.  I received the email saying we want you to serve on this committee and we're meeting at, let's say, on Thursday at three o'clock.  Well I had a class on Thursday at three o'clock.  So I sent back this following message.  Thank you for asking me to serve, but I have a class on Thursdays at three o'clock, so I will be unable to serve, and I let it go.  A week later I got a letter saying we have changed the time of the meeting to Wednesdays at one o'clock so that you would be able to serve.  And so two of the people who attended the meeting said to me, Joan, do you know the first thing we did today was decide on a new meeting time so that you could come.  And so I laughed.  I said why did you do that, I already told them that it was okay, I didn't need to be on the committee because I already had a class.  She said they wanted you on the committee.  Now, remember earlier I said people know where I stand, so, and I get hit in the face a lot.  So, they wanted somebody on the committee who was willing to step out and if something didn't appear to be okay, say so, not just be a yes person.  That's actually why they told me, that's why they changed the time because they had to make--they felt like maybe some of the other people on the committee would do it, but the person who was chairing the committee thought that I definitely would do it so she wanted to have me on there.  So she changed everything so I could come.  And that's what I mean I've been involved in all of these things, doing all of these things. It's time for me to turn the reigns over to other people so that they can do stuff.
Speaker 1: Well, it's good to be wanted, I guess, and needed.  But you're saying maybe it gets excessive sometimes or comes over the top?
Speaker 2: It does.  Plus, literally, that some of the younger people, and I've said this to them, especially people in the department and some of the other departments, we need to train them, we need to get them ready to make sure that Bowie State University's mission and strategic plans and retention plans and academic plans stay on point and move the university forward.  The older people are going to retire sooner or later we're going to go home.
Speaker 1: Are there any formal or informal, I guess, opportunities for intergenerational transmission amongst the faculty here?
Speaker 2: Sure.  In fact, we invite them to participate.  Some committees require certain ranks, but if the committee doesn't require a certain rank, we try to put season senior faculty and mid-faculty and young faculty together so they can see how these things work and so that they're not just interested in, I guess, the quick and easy way, because some of these things are hard.  To make the university valuable and to keep the university moving forward, you're going to have to make some hard decisions sometimes.  And so to make a hard decision, you're going to have to be willing to be hit in the face with a two by four because people will say things to you.  When I came here and I submitted--we did not, at that time, have ABET [Accreditation Board of Engineering and Technology] approval for our computer science program.  I submitted some work, I mean, a change for the program.  And one of the first things that one of the senior faculty member said was, why is that whenever new people come in, they want to change things?  And he said it to me.  What is wrong with you?  Well, I had just come from Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia] and even though Hampton's program was not accredited, we were following the ABET plan.  They were getting ready for accreditation, so I thought Bowie State University should follow the plan.  So another young faculty member was here at the time, Nagi Wakeem (ph.), so I submitted a proposal, he submitted an amendment to mine that increased it and made it a little more rigorous.  I tried to make it easier, mainly do this step and then do this step.  He wanted to do both steps at once, and we were both met with the statement that I just told you.  Why is it that new people want to change everything, everything was working just fine?  So you have to get them ready and prepared and able to get that kind of statement from senior faculty and still able to survive.  And I do admit that I waited until I was tenured before really--now the program changes I submitted early on because I felt like my department might complain, but they knew that we should be making changes.  But some of the other things that I did in the shared governance arena, I made sure that I was tenured first so they wouldn't send me home.
Speaker 1: That's always wise (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 26581
Speaker 1: Now, do you plan to stay at Bowie [State University, Bowie, Maryland] until you retire?
Speaker 2: Sure, I don't have very much time left.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you have any plans of being a president somewhere or taking another position?
Speaker 2: I'm too old for that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Technically, you're not too old.
Speaker 2: That's a whole another arena.  I'd have to really think about that, and you got to pay your dues if you do that, you got to pay your dues as a provost, so I would actually end up more being an associate provost or a provost somewhere if I changed to go along that particular path, in which is what I would probably end up as.  Because I don't have enough time to do all of that and be a president--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And then I would have to change some things.
Story_ID: 26582
Speaker 1: Now when you look back at your career and everything you've done to date, is there anything major that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Years ago, I had the opportunity to work with someone who tried to help people become associate provosts or provosts or presidents.  And to this day, the reason why I didn't do it is because at that moment I had young children.  I think if I had it to do over, I would work with the person, because I now know how to deal with having young children and doing that.  And at the time I didn't know and I didn't take the time to ask somebody and I really should have.  Because in later years, I discussed it with some people who had done it and their methods kept them in contact with their children, they actually had the children spend more time with them in their offices and all of that stuff, and I wasn't aware of actually, you know, taking your children to work and so, I would make a change in that respect.
Story_ID: 26583
Speaker 1: I know you spoke earlier of how you dealt with your children when you were pursuing your Ph.D. [degree].  Tell us a bit about those children today, how many do you have and what are their names?
Speaker 2: I have four--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --And my oldest--well everybody has a bachelor's degree, let me say that.  My oldest is the outlier, so I'll tell you about the other three.  I have a set of twins, girls, they both have Ph.D.s.  One of them has a Ph.D. in counseling psychology, she is on the clinical staff at Florida State [University, Tallahassee, Florida] the other has--and she got her Ph.D. from Howard University [Washington, District of Columbia].  Her sister has a Ph.D. from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in biology.  She is doing a post-doc at the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  My youngest has a master's in computer science.  She got her bachelor's from St. Mary's College and she got her master's from here.  My oldest graduated with her bachelor's from Old Dominion University in Norfolk [Virginia], and she is two courses short of a master's, but she is now making noises about going back, and I indicated to her, well, you know it now, you're going to have to redo lots of your courses or change programs and do all of your courses, but she has decided that's she's willing to do that.  I tried to get her not to stop when she stopped, but the job that she had was demanding and she said she really wanted to work, but now she's going to go back.  So we did those things and that's where they are in their careers right now.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your second marriage is still--
Speaker 2: Oh, my husband just recently retired.  He was an employee for the census bureau for lots and lots of years.  He's a computer scientist.  I met him at a computer science conference, okay.  So we had a lot to talk about, and we still talk about it.  We walk every morning.  I walk about five miles before I come to work.  He doesn't walk a full five miles, he only walks with me for about half of that.  But while we're out there, we talk about computer science, he's also a mathematician, he has engineering, mathematics and computer science in his background.  So we discuss things like that, especially what's happening in the academic arena, what's happening in Science News, that's one of the magazines that we get for sure, and we talk about some of the more famous physicists and mathematicians as we walk, still read about them, those kinds of things.  National Geographic Magazine is a major topic at our house because we take that as well.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 26584
Speaker 1: Now, once again, when you look back on everything you've done at this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Anywhere?  Now, I'll say here at Bowie [State University, Bowie, Maryland], while I was dean, so the colleges that--the school/colleges establishment here was a major thing, because I actually set the structure up for it initially.  I was on the original committee for it, so I would say initiating the founding of the College of Arts and Sciences here at Bowie State University and I'm a shared governance person, so I would say the work that I've done with shared governance, because I worked with the faculty and I've worked with the presidents, several presidents, since I've been here.  My first shared governance committee was I was chair of the faculty welfare committee, if you can believe that. And I'll tell you a little story behind that.  One of the senior faculty members came to me and said if I get the signatures for this will you run, because you have to have a nominating sheet and enough people have to sign to say you're nominated.  He said I'll get the signatures if you agree to run.  My first encounter because I had no intention of running for shared governance here at Bowie.  And I said, well, okay.  So he went around--and I had to be the first signature on the piece of paper, so I did.  And he went around and got the other nine, and he turned it in, and I put my name on the ballot, and I won.  And since then I've done things in shared governance on campus and at the university system in Maryland, so I would say that.  The college and my shared governance work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 26585
Speaker 1: And what are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American today?
Speaker 2: Oh my goodness.  Most people don't know and they believe that every African American males are more often in jail than in college and that's not true, but having said that, there aren't enough of them in college.  So I have the hope that they will get a leader who can have them think about education as being a thing that can actually help them and move them forward.  I have some students who have come and they have done so much and they work so hard but then I have others who have decided that college is not for them, and it does not have to be for you, I mean just learning.  If they would just do something to improve themselves and improve their minds, learn how to work the system to help you instead of standing out so that you're appearing to be fighting against the system instead of trying to change it so that what you want and what you can do will happen.  That's what I would like for the African American males to do, and I would love for the African American females to continue to go to school, improve themselves, because they keep doing that, more and more of them, and then more and more of them are majoring in science engineering and mathematics where we need them, so doing those kinds of things, changing the system from the inside, becoming the people that can make a difference, not having it said that the few African Americans that people talk about, well this person is, oh, he's really articulate.  How about when you think about African Americans you think automatically that they are articulate, you don't have to say it.  I want a common saying to be said about African Americans.  People say Asian Americans are smart, people say Hispanic Americans are hard workers.  Let's have a common thing said about African Americans.  African Americans are knowledgeable and are willing to work to change the system from within, let's have that kind of thing said so that there's a common thing, not African Americans are good at sports because so often that's what you hear, not that you can't be good at sports, some Hispanics are good at sports, some Asians are good at sports, okay, but you still have the other terms apply to them automatically.  I want an automatic term applied to African Americans.

Speaker 1: Well, you didn't ask this, but I did go to HERS.  HERS [Summer Institute for Women in Higher Education Administration] is a program at Bryn Mawr [College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania] for women in higher education.  And one of the things that we, of course, did there was interact with lots and lots of women from all types of higher education institutions.  And you get a feeling for being an administrator for everybody, I mean all diversity areas.  So, even though there aren't males there, it's with respect to females, but one of the things that they expose you to is well, what are you going to do if you have students who are not heterosexual in your class, what are you going to do to make sure that they are feeling like you're treating them just the same way as everybody else.  What are you going to do to make your non-heterosexual staff members feel like everything is okay.  So, we learned how to deal with all faculty, all staff, students, diversity was the big thing for that particular program, and it was wonderful.
Speaker 2: What does HERS stand for?
Speaker 1: Higher Education--you would ask me that because I don't remember.  I did it so long ago.
Speaker 2: What is that?
Speaker 1: Well it's a made up acronym because when I went, it was women in higher education.  That's what I actually attended, Women in Higher Education.  They since changed it to HERS, and I don't remember the complete acronym, but for us it was Women in Higher Education.  The Women in Higher Education Program run by Bryn Mawr each summer.
Speaker 2: Okay.

Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered by my students, actually by people in general, but primarily I have a wish for my students to remember that I did not make it easy for them in class but I gave them what they needed, hard work, fairness.  One of the things that I've strived to do was be fair with any group, it doesn't matter what the group is, whether it was my staff people, whether it was students, my superiors, to me during the fair thing is the best, and I actually had a mentor, Dr. Cathy Walton, who said that a long time ago.  She said you should be fair and sometimes you're going to have to make hard decisions.  So even though people may not like the hard decisions, they should realized that you were fair when you made that hard decision, and you will know that you had some hard decisions to make because after you're an administrator, after that time period, if everybody still likes you, you didn't make any hard decisions.  When you make a hard decision it's going to go against what some people want, and it's going to be in favor of what other people want.  So always be fair when you do that and then you can sleep with yourself, your conscious will be clear.  So that is what I try to do every day when I deal with the everyday situations here, I ask for information, I base the decision on as much information as I can, and I try to be as fair as possible, but there are times when I say no and I don't have a choice, have to.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, thank you very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
