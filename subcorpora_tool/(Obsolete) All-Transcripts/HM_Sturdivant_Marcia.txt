Story_ID: 176787
Speaker 1: Now, before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions we always ask as kind of a warm-up and they only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: First one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what is it?
Speaker 2: Crab legs.

Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination.
Speaker 2: Oh, Disney World.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the last one is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No, I can't think of one.  Let's see, what do I usually say?  Yeah, I know what I say a lot, it is what it is. (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 176788
Speaker 1: All right, now I'm gonna ask about your family history on your mother's side of the family and your father's side.  We'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Jean Clinton Barron Sturdivant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell that?
Speaker 2: J-E-A-N; Clinton, C-L-I-N-T-O-N; Barron, B-A-R-R-O-N; Sturdivant, S-T-U-R-D-I-V-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: All right.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: May 14, 1947; I'm sorry, 1927 [May 14, 1927].
Speaker 1: Okay, and where was she born?
Speaker 2: Columbus, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where is Columbus in relationship to say Jackson [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Columbus is north, northern part of Mississippi, north--I guess that would be west.
Speaker 1: Northwest, near Holly Springs [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: I don't know where Holly Springs is.
Speaker 1: West College--
Speaker 2: West Point, Mississippi, Tupaloo--Tougaloo, Tougaloo, Mississippi, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, what can you tell us about the ancestors on your mother's side?  How far back can you trace, per se?
Speaker 2: I can trace back, I probably should have my cousin do this.  I can trace back to Civil War, pretty much, Civil War.  They're from the Brownrigg plantation, I guess you could say.  My mother's mother was a Brownrigg.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Brownrigg?
Speaker 2: B-R-O-W-N-R-I-G-G, and they were significant individuals, so to speak, in Columbus at the time and, you know, there's a book on the history of Columbus and Brownrigg.  I believe he was their general or something in the army, but that's--
Speaker 1: You mean Confederate?
Speaker 2: Confederate, yeah.  That's my, from my mom's side.  My mother's father was Eldrew Barron, and they were all from that area.
Speaker 1: His name is Elger (ph.)?
Speaker 2: Eldrew, E-L-D-R-E-W, Barron.
Speaker 1: Barron, okay.
Speaker 2: And my mother's mother, which would be my maternal grandmother, was Rosa Lee Brownrigg Robinson Barron.  These people had a lot to--lots of names.  She died very young, when my mother was three, and for several years, my mother was raised by her maternal aunts and my grandfather, her father.  My grandfather worked on the railroad and he was a fireman on the railroad, and my mom used to talk about, or still does, about his journeys on the railway that, I guess the train would pass their house and she would wait for him at lunchtime and wave when the train would go by and sometimes he would take her with him.  I think it was the train from Columbus to Jackson, or the short run, and she also stayed with her mother's sisters--
Speaker 1: What happened to her mother?  Was her mother still--
Speaker 2: You know, a lot of folks don't talk a lot about it but it was interesting because she was so young when she died.  It was, I would think now it would have been something like cerebral palsy, because she had polio and my mom, maybe that was it, but it wasn't until my mother had travelled home to bury one of her aunts and they showed her pictures and she said she didn't realize that her, she always had images of her mother sitting, but her mother was in a wheelchair.  She was paralyzed and, from the waist down.  But that was that memory she was able to recall, that memory.  But she lived with my, like I said, with her father for several years before he remarried and she had a very close relationship with her mother's sisters and brothers so there was a lot of love there but, you know, as a young child she had a lot of transitions, you know, to make.
Story_ID: 176789
Speaker 1: What did your mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] say about, well, first of all are there any stories about the, that come from the Brownrigg era, from living with the Brownriggs?
Speaker 2: No, she doesn't have memories that I would term as negative, which wasn't necessarily the same situation for my father [O.C. Sturdivant] and I don't know what accounts for that other than looking back at that time, say the late '20s [1920s] or early '30s [1930s], you know the [Great] Depression, an so on, that he was a working man.  Her father [Eldrew Barron] was a working man and that was regular work for an African American man.
Speaker 1: So they were, I mean, your mother's father was in association with the Brownriggs through--
Speaker 2: No, the Brownriggs were my mother's mother [Rosa Lee Brownrigg Robinson Barron].
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah. I was asking about that since that is a famous plantation or whatever, and it has been written about.  Did they have any stories of what life was like on that plantation?
Speaker 2: No, I don't personally have any.  She's never mentioned anything like that, you know, to me.  She did recall, and I thought this was interesting, not too long ago she went home, maybe ten, fifteen years ago she went home to her home to bury her aunt Lula (ph.), who was a revered person down in their little community and they're sitting on the porch and I guess the southern custom is a lot of people from the neighborhood are coming over paying their respect, black and white, and she says she's sitting there and a white family comes over to pay their respects and they paid their respects and they talked about, you know, what a great person her aunt was and then went on to say that they were interested in holding a family reunion and my mom, you know, was curious of what do you mean by that and he says, "Well, we were the family that owned your family during slavery."  (Laughter) that's hilarious to me.  I mean, you have to laugh just not from, just wanting to be so angry, but it just stopped, you know, the conversation, she said, and these were people that apparently the, my mom's family had known, but that part of their history, at least from my mother's perspective, had died, but the white family apparently kept that history and importantly kept the history of what they meant to those black folks down the street.  I think that that is just, it speaks volumes, where, sort of, I guess, we have moved on.  My mom's family had moved on, but that white family that was apparently a sense of pride.  At one time, their ancestors had owned my mom's family.  You know, I find it phenomenal.
Speaker 1: You think, implicit in that question was a suggestion that they were blood relatives too?
Speaker 2: I, if they know their history, I guess they might have, they should have been aware, you know, there had to be something on there but that was, that was never claimed by, you know, by my mom's family.  But I'm curious.  I wonder if they do see that as some relative relation.  Now my mom and other, her other relatives certainly didn't embrace the notion and, in fact, she said it took them everything to be gracious but, you know, they were gracious and declined an offer to get together with the former owners of their family (laughter) but, when you think about, I guess, the continuation of a privilege, supremacy, ownership, all of that paternalism, that here is a family who carries that whole idea from generation to generation to generation, and you're walking around as neighbors, not knowing that they're saying, "Hey, we used to own you."  It's kind of, it's kind of strange to me, but no, that was never something that she has talked about that far back. And some things I know that we, when we share stories and she would share stories, that I believe it's so much of a painful existence or experience that you don't ta--some things you just don't talk about.
Story_ID: 176790
Speaker 1: But, from her [Sturdivant's mother, Jean Barron Sturdivant] perspective, her childhood was much more fortunate than many young, African American women during the time.  She had, you know, family even though her mom [Rosa Lee Brownrigg Robinson Barron] had passed early but, you know, father [Eldrew Barron] who was employed, gainfully employed, they owned a house, you know, which was a sense of pride and, in fact, we went, we, I took my mom back to her, I think it was her fortieth or fiftieth school reunion, class reunion, and I remember as a child we would travel back and forth every now and then to Columbus [Mississippi], but this was, you know, during my adulthood and I had, you know, had married and had kids and we went and took mama home and she showed me the house and when you start to look at the perspective, I guess your image and perception of what it was like in the '20s [1920s] and the '30s, [1930s], they didn't live, they lived pretty well for a black family back then, and that's clearly her memory as a child.  She was a very precocious child.  Even her aunts and uncles would say that when they were still living, and I believe--she had two older siblings, a brother and a sister, my aunt Gladys (ph.) and my uncle Eldrew (ph.), and I knew them very well, you know, as a child and her dad remarried after they, the two older ones, had moved out, and I have lots of aunts and uncles.  Most of them also have passed away from this second set, but there was a period of time where my mother was the only child and that led, no doubt, to, you know, opportunities for her to do things that, say, other children couldn't have done.  Like, she didn't work, so to speak, in the fields or anything like that and, this is all from my psychological training, but she was a voracious reader, still is, you know, at eighty-seven years old, loves to read and coming up as a child I can always picture my mother reading.  You know, she was always at, any quiet time or free time that she had she was always reading and her house to this day is filled with books and she loves the classics, and we used to think, oh, my goodness, these things are so boring, but, you know, [Charles] Dickens and all, and public television because they would show, you know, the classics.  So, having that opportunity to be an only child and, you know, having not to do some of the things that other young children of African descent had to do during that time, you know, she was fortunate and she realizes that, and she'll say how blessed she was.
Story_ID: 176791
Speaker 1: She [Sturdivant's mother, Jean Barron Sturdivant] went to school, which was something that she says a lot of children weren't able to do at the time, because they had to work, you know the farms, but she was able to go to school and loved school and was apparently very bright at school.  She was the--she graduated when she was sixteen from high school and--
Speaker 2: Do you know what school she graduated from?  The name of the school?
Speaker 1: Yes, Union Academy [Columbus, Mississippi].  When I think of those names, and before that I believe it was Robert E. Lee something and they changed to Union Academy.
Speaker 2: There may be a story there or something--it was Robert E. Lee at one time?
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, 'cuz I looked it up and then it became Union Academy.
Speaker 2: That seems like some kind of dramatic story there.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  Yes. Yes. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Something from Robert E. Lee to the Union Academy.
Speaker 1: Right.  It was segregated, of course, during that time.  They have reunions every now and then, well every year.  And, we began to go, I'd say maybe starting about ten years ago we would go every few years and I did notice that the class size got smaller and smaller, but they would have reunions for several decades and, you know, I guess students who had graduated in the '50s [1950s] and '60s [1960s], that's when it became Union Academy.  But, she talked about having, being in elementary school like a one-room classroom, and there would be all ages of students there, because this is how you did it, and then they went to school during a time when, I guess, the fields didn't need to be tended to or whatever, but school wasn't as we know it, you know, straight through.  But, she had the opportunity to remain in school and, you know, because of that she was, and I guess given some other things, she was just a very bright student and, you know, graduated from high school at the age of sixteen.  She even has a copy of her speech that she did as a senior.
Speaker 2: Did she graduate from Union Academy?
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 2: At age sixteen.
Speaker 1: At age sixteen.
Speaker 2: Now, did she have college aspirations?
Speaker 1: Yes.  And she went to college at a school called, let me get the name right, it was Mary Holmes Teachers College for Colored Girls, or Colored Women (laughter).  Now, it's Mary Holmes, I think, College or University [sic, Mary Holmes College, West Point, Mississippi] and, in fact, they have their reunions at that particular school.  Well, she met my father [O.C. Sturdivant] and he went off to war [World War II, WWII].  He lived in the same city where-(unclear) (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Now, is Mary Holmes Teachers College in Columbus [Mississippi]?
Speaker 1: Columbus, yeah [sic].
Speaker 2: Yes, in Columbus.
Speaker 1: And, I looked back to, of course my mom's memory isn't what it used to be but I looked back and I remember some of our conversations about West Point, Mississippi, and a college there, that apparently she had taken some classes and, but she got married after the war, well she met my dad.  My dad was from Columbus.  She lived more, I guess if you could call it, the city.  Certainly isn't a major metropolitan area, but she lived more in the urban section and he lived in the rural section.
Speaker 2: Now was there a, did your mother have a, what was her aspiration in college?  What was she trying to be?
Speaker 1: A teacher.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, a teacher.
Story_ID: 176792
Speaker 1: Now, let's, I'm gonna leave her [Sturdivant's mother, Jean Barron Sturdivant] right there for now and we'll do your father's side, and we'll put 'em together.  So, can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: O.C. Sturdivant, and you spell it O-period, C-period, last name S-T-U-R-D-I-V-A-N-T.
Speaker 1: Now, is there a story about O.C. Sturdivant? (Laughter).  Does the O and the C stand for anything?
Speaker 2: It's a funny family story.  Apparently it doesn't stand for anything other than O.C., and coming up as a child it was always a subject, it was very sensitive to me until later and I just embraced it.  But people, you know, we would get mail and he would even laugh about it.  People would try to make it a name.  He'd get mail.  One time I remember he got a piece of mail, Onc Sturdivant (laughter) and we just laughed about it.  My brother was named Otis Charles, and my mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] talks about how, you know, she wanted, of course, to pay tribute to my dad but also to give some name to it.  But it's just, you know, a southern tradition.  A lot of people had initials.  It doesn't stand for anything.  O.C., I don't know why.  He was one of thirteen children and, perhaps, my grandma [Clemmon Dobbins Sturdivant] just ran out of names or got tired of whatever, but it was O.C. Sturdivant.
Story_ID: 176793
Speaker 1: Now, Sturdivant is a name you don't hear that often.  Is there a story behind that?  Is it German or--?
Speaker 2: It's Dutch.
Speaker 1: Dutch, okay.
Speaker 2: There's also an English Sturdivant name, but it's from, where I can gather if you look at history, the Stuyvesant, Sturdivant, you know, the Dutch were some of the first to enslave people here in the [United] States, so we've been around for a long, long time and that's what we understand, you know, and I understand is my history, just, you know, an old slave name.  I get a lot of questions about my name wherever I go and, you know, I kept my name after I got married.  I hyphenated it for awhile but I kept it 'cause I did want to keep that memory alive, but wherever I go people ask me.  They know a Sturdivant, both black and white people will ask me about it and try to connect, and I've not, only one time I've had some feeling that there was a connection but, with someone that I didn't know previously, but we were apparently, at one time our ancestors were on the same plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is somebody white?
Speaker 2: No, this was a black person, yes, and they were from Alabama, like their roots were from Alabama and there are a lot of Sturdivants there and she had traced back to a plantation or something there, so, and I know that the Sturdivants had sold some of the Sturdivants, like to North Carolina, some of the slaves, and so on, but it's an old slave name that, you know, just like other African Americans, we took the name on and--
Story_ID: 176794
Speaker 1: Now, let me ask you, what is your father's [O.C. Sturdivant] date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: March 10, 1924, and he was also born in Columbus, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, for the question again--what can you tell us about his side of the family?  How far back can you trace that part and what are the stories?
Speaker 2: The stories are that you could trace back to slavery and my dad would talk a lot about an aunt, I want to say Lucy (ph.) but I don't want to say that for sure, but he would say that she was born, she was a slave and what I professionally would call post-traumatic stress mental health.  He affectionately said she was different and she had different behaviors and they didn't call it mental health, but that's what it was, and he said they always just attributed, "Oh well, just remember, she was, that's just a slave.  She was an old slave."  So, you know, not having the formal education, say that I've had they were able to translate that understanding that her behaviors were a result of her past.  So, they could at least trace that back to that period of time.  Now my father's father was born in 1873, which would have been ten years post Emancipation Proclamation.  So, there's a rich history there, just, you know, survivors of slavery and my dad was the thirteenth child of the union between my paternal grandfather, whose name was Will Sturdivant, and my maternal, I'm sorry, my paternal grandmother, who was Clemmon Sturdivant.
Speaker 1: So, your grandfather was born in 1873, now about your grandmother, I mean, what did your grandfather do?
Speaker 2: He was a farmer.
Speaker 1: Okay, he was a farmer.
Speaker 2: Farmer.
Speaker 1: And your grandmother, was she a housewife?
Speaker 2: Housewife, right, right.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Now, they don't talk about, my daddy never said they were sharecroppers.
Speaker 1: Did they own some land?
Speaker 2: That's my understanding, and I'm trying to verify that but, you know, you're looking at from the perception of a child there, but he talked very lovingly about the farm and the horses and the cows, et cetera.
Speaker 1: So, now that your father was--did he have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: No.  My dad went to the [U.S.] Navy, World War II [WWII] broke out and enlisted into the Navy and was drafted.  I'm not sure about that.  That's interesting, and I do know that he was young, like seventeen. He was younger than what he should have been to go.
Speaker 1: That would have been around about 1940 or '41 [1941]?
Speaker 2: Let me see, if he was in '24 [1924], yeah about '41, [1941]. About 1941.
Story_ID: 176795
Speaker 1: We were talking off-camera about Paul Laurence Dunbar, and, at any rate. But, so your father [O.C. Sturdivant], so he didn't get a chance to go to school at all?
Speaker 2: No, he graduated, I believe he, I don't know if he graduated high school, 'cuz my mom [Jean Barron Sturdivant] says she remembers him in school, but then he wasn't in school, and I don't know if there was another high school in the area, but she also said that, you know, kids who work the fields and work the farms, that, you know, you were all hands on deck.  He was another reader, and he had a ritual.  The guy had his coffee.  He was a pretty decent cook, too.  He liked to cook and breakfast food was his favorite, and he would get up at the break of dawn, oh my goodness, early in the morning, five in the morning, make his coffee, make his hoecake.  You know what a hoecake is?  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: I think it's a little, well explain what it is.  I think I have an idea, but explain.
Speaker 2: I just call it fried dough, 'cause that's basically--
Speaker 1: Like cornmeal or something?
Speaker 2: Well, his was white flour.  That would have been a hushpuppy, but he would, it's just like fried dough on top of the stove, and I've tried to duplicate that. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, there's slave narrative, they talk about, they talk about it in Solomon Northup's story ['Twelve Years a Slave'], I think.  They actually put the dough on a hoe and hold it over the fire.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it fries on the--
Speaker 2: On a--and he would make that thing so crispy, golden brown.  I guess it's just flour, baking powder, lard, and you fry it, and he would have syrup with it, sometimes a little fatback, (unclear), not very healthy as we know today but, that and then reading the paper.
Story_ID: 176796
Speaker 1: It was important for him [Sturdivant's father, O.C. Sturdivant] to have an update or understanding what was going on in the world and he could talk about politics as if he had gone to school for it, and he would just read every single article and then want to discuss it, you know, and I would remember, you know, going off to school and he would start talking, "Hey, did you know about what's going on," and--
Speaker 2: Did he have a particular political preference?
Speaker 1: Oh, he was Democrat. Oh, big time Democrat. in fact, when I was in college, I had a part time job in a law firm, and one of the attorneys, a very nice man who later became a, I think it was on a superior court of Pennsylvania, a very nice man, and sort of took me under his wing and he, when he was running, in fact, he ran a couple of times as I recall, and he would take me around, you know, show me the ropes, and then I did a little commercial for him and everything, and I didn't, you know, I knew him personally so I brought his, one of his campaign posters home and put it in the window and when my dad came home from work that evening, he hit the roof.  He said, "What--is this white Republican doing in the window!"  (Laughter) I explained to him, you know, that he was somebody I worked, you know, worked with.
Speaker 2: How old were you then?
Speaker 1: Oh, I had to be about eighteen, nineteen years old--in '75 [1975], '76 [1976].
Speaker 2: Now, this is after, then the Dixiecrats had moved to the Republican Party--
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: They started making their move in '67 [1967], '68 [1968], and they tried to run George Wallace as an independent, and that didn't work so they migrated to Republican.
Speaker 1: He was a very big Democrat, and voting was so important to him and he never--neither him or my mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] would miss voting.
Speaker 2: Was there a story about how they first voted?  You'd have been a little girl, I guess. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's interesting you ask me that.  Yeah.  I don't remember that.  I do know that, while I don't recall them saying that, I do know that they always talked about my oldest sister, who was born in 1965, that she, they moved here with her when she was an infant, but they say if we had stayed in Alabama, she would not have been able to vote when she came of age.  So, I assumed that when they came up here in the late '40s [1940s] that she, you know, that they were able to vote.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  I mean--here in--
Speaker 1: Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], they came here.
Speaker 2: But they never did vote down--
Speaker 1: Oh no, yeah no, no. You couldn't vote down there, no, no.
Story_ID: 176797
Speaker 1: And by that time, they were living in Alabama, you said?
Speaker 2: Alabama, yeah.  After the war [World War II, WWII], when he [Sturdivant's father, O.C. Sturdivant] returned from the war--
Speaker 1: Well, let's go--let's do the war first.  He had an interesting experience serving on the [U.S.S.] Intrepid in the [U.S.] Navy--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right, in the Navy.
Speaker 1: --And tell us the significance of the Intrepid.
Speaker 2: Yes.  The U.S.S. Intrepid was a famous battleship in World War II, and it was famous because it was hit several times and it never sank.  Kamikaze pilots' planes, you know, hit it and clearly, you know, the Japanese during the end of the war, they're running out of this military personnel but that would it, and that ship was hit several times and it didn't sink, and I remember fondly of stories my dad would tell about the U.S.S. Intrepid, and he called his ship, her ship, you know, "her," I guess it's like a sailor or whatever, but the Navy, of course, was segregated at the time and he was a steward mate.  That was the only position that, you know, African Americans could, you know, serve.  But he talks a lot about the battles and I remember one day he was, one story where he talked about how this ship had been hit and I would imagine because they were African Americans, of course, their bunks were lower.
Speaker 1: Now, this is an important point because, I've heard this story before, that many times our ships in the Navy and transport ships that the [U.S.] Army used, African American sailors would be in the lowest region of the ship near the boiler room, where it was extremely hot, stuffy.
Speaker 2: Right, uncomfortable, you know, the whole thing.  And he said, one time, that the ship was hit and their quarters filled up with water and--I'm not gon' cry with this 'cuz the more I think about it, it just--he talked about how he survived and others survived, but there were a lot of sailors that didn't survive, so you're down there and he said it was days where he recorded how dark it was, you know, I guess the bough of the ship just filled with smoke, water pouring in, and he said, you know, they would tap and then, you know, he said are there any, is anyone down there, is anyone alive?  And he recalled that they shoveled, through a pipe or something, sandwiches down there, but you're sitting in this, standing in this water and whatever, but he survived that.  Me being the social justice person which I'm thinking, you know, angers me, but he thought it was, you know, just another experience of being in the [U.S.] Military.  But anyway, he, you know, survived the war and he was in the Navy at the end of World War II, at the dropping of the bomb and that is the one time, of course he had many stories of injustice, but it was never in a sense that was, how can I put it, hateful.  You know, he described it as a, you know, part of his experience, but I did see signs of trauma when he talked about that dropping of that bomb and the impact it had.
Speaker 1: The bomb dropped on Hiroshima [Japan]?
Speaker 2: Hiroshima, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now where was he, actually?
Speaker 2: I guess he was on a ship somewhere, 'cause--
Speaker 1: Was he off the coast of Japan at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I don't believe.  He served in the South Pacific.  So, that's something I'll have to--
Speaker 1: They were hit by kamikaze as you say,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Then, which are suicide, pilots who fly their planes--(simultaneous)--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Fly their planes--and yes, right.  The U.S.S. Intrepid, I guess 'cuz my dad was on it and he had to come back and make sure I was born.  It didn't sink, and that's its claim to fame and people in the military know the USS Intrepid.  It's a museum [Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum, New York, New York] now in New York Harbor.
Speaker 1: Is it right off the coast of New York or is it in the harbor in New York City?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's in the harbor in New York City, uh-huh, yeah.  It's a museum, and I had the--
Speaker 1: Now is Intrepid--is that a carrier or a--
Speaker 2: Yes, because, I guess planes--
Speaker 1: Land--yeah, that's an aircraft.  (Simultaneous) that's a big aircraft carrier you can see right off of--all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's the one that everybody sees in New York City as they go down the Harlem River Drive, I guess, or the--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My daddy served on that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He served on that.  We went, my husband and I visited the ship and I'm planning on taking my sons up there this summer to see the ship.  He was very concerned about wanting to be back, to go back and see, and unfortunately he passed before I could take him back up there, but when we went they were very accommodating.  When they found out that we were children of an alumni of the U.S.S. Intrepid, they really treated us like royalty and gave us a private tour.  They called my dad.  He was still alive then and it really was a sense of pride, you know, with that.

Speaker 1: But after the war [World War II, WWII], he [Sturdivant's father, O.C. Sturdivant] came back and he talked about, you know, coming back after all of that, coming to the United States, back to the United States.  He was stationed in San Diego [California], and making that train ride back to Columbus [Mississippi], and the segregation hitting him back in the face again after all of that, and he said he recalled he couldn't get any food to eat because many of the places wouldn't serve African Americans.  So, he said knowing, he said a lot of the guys weren't from the South, he said, but coming from the South, he knew that a lot of these southern towns had black sections and he talked about, I'm smiling because he said Texas must be the biggest place in the world, 'cause he said he went to sleep, woke up, we were in Texas.  Went to sleep again, we're still in Texas.  Texas, Texas, Texas, he would say, 'cause he said it just seemed like they could never get through Texas, but he said he finally found, they stopped somewhere and he asked, "Where's the colored section?"  And he said he went back and found this colored section of town and was able to get a loaf of bread and a bag of oranges.  And when he came back to the train, you know, they were laughing at him and whatever he said, but then he said he had to share his loaf of bread and his bag of oranges.  But he-and again just talking about, you know, this is how things were.
Story_ID: 176799
Speaker 1: But, he [Sturdivant's father, O.C. Sturdivant] came back, married my mom [Jean Barron Sturdivant].  They had my oldest sister.  They moved to Birmingham, Alabama--
Speaker 2: Now wait a minute.  Now we're speedin' through this.  But we have to--I want to ask you, like how they met.  Did they know each other in Columbus, Mississippi?
Speaker 1: Someone introduced them, yeah.  So they knew each other before he went to the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 2: Okay, but they didn't go to the same church or anything?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: You said your mother remembers him from school, being there sometimes. (Simultanetous)--
Speaker 1: From school, right, and then I believe it was my mother's cousin; yes, it was my mother's cousin who introduced them, and I guess that started the romance, but my dad would talk about their, I guess their "courting" back then and, you know it was very strict courting requirements, and he said he could call on her.  That's how he said it, "call on her;" her father [Eldrew Barron] would let him call on her on Sundays and they would sit in the parlor (laughter) and talk, or they sat on the porch.  Her aunt Lula [ph.] would sit with them while they sat on the porch.  I don't know how anyone gets married with that, but, guess something happened here (laughter).
Speaker 2: They figured out a way to get away.
Speaker 1: They figure out, yeah, then he got called off to the, you know, went to the war and--
Story_ID: 176800
Speaker 1: Now there's one more story about your father [O.C. Sturdivant] that's one of the early stories and you said that he did not, that you mentioned once, you asked your father at one point when you were a little girl how do we get straight hair?  Or so-called good hair.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, before my enlightening days, but he, my dad was a very simple man, liked simple things and I still can picture him in overalls.  You know, whenever he wasn't working he would have overalls and piddlin' in the dirt.  But, one thing that he liked was a clean shave and that hot shave with that hot lather and-
Speaker 1: And put the hot towel over himself--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --And put the hot lather--
Speaker 2: Right, and a haircut.  And, he would go, I could still picture the barber, but sometimes I would cut his hair, you know, when I got older, and I remember, you know, touching his hair and running and I says, "Daddy," and I'm so ashamed of this, I says, "Daddy, your hair, you have such pretty hair.  It's so good."  Oh my goodness, and I can count the number of times my dad yelled at me 'cause he was, he was real quiet but he grabbed my hand, I remember, and he turned me around and he said, "Don't you ever say that."  And he said, "All hair is good hair.  If you got some hair, you have good hair."  (Laughter) and he said, "do you know why my hair is like this?"  And he went on to explain.  He says, "My mother's mother didn't have a choice."  Yeah, you know, that--
Speaker 1: So did you get that--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, yeah, I started to, you know.  And he was pretty graphic about it, which, again, was one of the few times we ever had that kind of a conversation, but I remember him telling me that black women, and he would call it, he said, "colored women back then--you didn't have a choice of who you selected to date."  And he said, "There was nothing that we could do.  So, if I'm looking like this, it wasn't by choice.  So, he said, that's not something to be proud of.  That's not something you celebrate or anything."  And that had a lasting, you know, impression, and both my parents were very proud--are very, well my mom's [Jean Barron Sturdivant] still with us--very proud, black people and we were never able to say things like use color shades like light-skin, dark-skinned people couldn't say that, couldn't hear whatever, we just weren't allowed to say that, saying "nigger" would immediately get you a beat-down.  I mean, there were just certain things that related to ethnic pride, even before the Black Power Movement or the, you know, when people were into that.  In my family, we were just not allowed to make those differences and I, you know, I see now and you know, I saw once I started to really study, that it was a different time, a different experience for them and not very easy but they never accepted that, which is, I think, rather unique.
Story_ID: 176801
Speaker 1: Okay back to your mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] and your father [O.C. Sturdivant], now, so when your father came back from war [World War II, WWII], he moved the family to Alabama; to what part?
Speaker 2: Birmingham [Alabama].
Speaker 1: To Birmingham, okay.
Speaker 2: Actually, it's a little, they lived in Birmingham.  I have family on my mom--my father's side in Bessemer [Alabama], which is, I guess a little, you know Bessemer? (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: A steel mill--I knew somebody who lives there.
Speaker 2: Is that right?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: My father actually worked there at some point.
Speaker 2: Is that right?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Bessemer, Alabama.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Bessemer, Alabama.
Speaker 1: So my oldest sister was born in Birmingham, no sorry--he moved her.  They moved, right, 'cause my oldest sister was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and they lived there for a while and then, during, just like many African Americans, the Great Migration, you started to look for opportunities North, and my father came here to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and sought a job in the steel mill.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So was he up here, well, there's a connection--yeah, I can think of a connection from Bessemer, being steel down in Pittsburgh being the biggest of all in those days.
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, 'cause Birmingham was the Pittsburgh of the South, right.  But he came here to find work.  You know, the call--steel mill was booming and he settled in a little, actually it's a part of Pittsburgh, that's not a suburb.  Hazelwood, yeah, Hazelwood, Pennsylvania, and it was a big steel mill, the J and L Steel, Jones and Laughlin Steel [Company], huge steel mill, and then sent for my mother and my sister, and I think now how difficult that must have been they were very young, you know, very young, didn't have any relatives here, didn't know anyone, and came here and made a life, you know, and coming from the country where it's green, and, you know, warm weather, you come to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in the middle of winter, I can't imagine, and my mom talked about when she came here she would write her father [Eldrew Barron] and say that she didn't know if she could survive this, but she says if hell, if there's a hell, then it must look like Pittsburgh because (laughter) everything--
Speaker 2: Why couldn't they have been persuaded somewhere to move to Pittsburgh because of the Pittsburgh Courier, that was the, you know, most popular black paper there was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I don't know, you know, that could have been.  I don't know how they, why Pittsburgh because there were other still producing cities, but I guess, you know, Pittsburgh being the main one, I mean, the height of it and the Courier could have, you know, 'cause they did recruit, you know, families to move here, but my dad didn't stay in the mill long.  You know, people have these, even I can remember when I was in high school [at West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania] the city was, you know, they were still booming in production and industry so, you know, oftentimes, and they had cleaned up the air and the, you know, the environment but, you know, in the '40s [1940s], '50s, [1950s], you know my mom said that, you know, you couldn't even wash clothes, that if you washed clothes and you hang something outside that it would just get, you know, black, and that was hard.  She talked about how hard that was for her not seeing sunlight; you know, the smoke, not knowing anyone and just becoming very depressed, that this was horrible.  But, he ended up going to the Bureau of Mines, United States Bureau of Mines, and worked there as a laborer in maintenance for until he retired.  I think he worked there about forty-five years and retired just before he passed.
Story_ID: 176802
Speaker 1: Yeah, they [Sturdivant's parents, Jean Barron Sturdivant and O.C. Sturdivant] moved to, I don't know what it looked like in the '40s [1940s] or the '50s, [1950s], but I know what Hazelwood [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] looked like in the '70s [1970s], late '60s [1960s] and '70s, [1970s], so it had to be bad.  Of all the parts, I guess, of Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] to move to, that might have been the most unattractive when it comes to, you know, the production of steel.  They later moved to further out in Pittsburgh, near Homestead [Pennsylvania]; in fact, it was called New Homestead and it was, you know, it's a real woody area where they sort of escaped.  They could see the smoke, but it was much more rural, I guess you could say, and later they moved to West Mifflin [Pennsylvania].  They built a house.  My dad built the house himself; in fact, as part of the GI bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944] coming home, he has a carpenter's license or certificate.  The [U.S.] Navy trained him in carpentry and he was very, he was very good at being a, you know, handy man and he could fix, my dad could fix anything, but they ended up buying a plot of land in the suburb--he--and my mother often told stories about him building it by himself.  It was a, you know, small house, we all-three bedroom, ranch house, but he said once they laid the foundation, he just, he built it himself, which is, it's just phenomenal.  It really is a different story, things that you take for granted.
Speaker 2: I heard those kind of stories before and just how unique they are.  I mean, I don't, in the North there is hardly anyone that you know that goes around--I've heard those stories in the South.  That's got to be something.  So, you lived in Hazelwood I guess until--
Speaker 1: I, well I don't know when they moved to New Homestead but I know they moved to West Mifflin.  The house was finished in 1956, because my mom said I was six months old when they moved, so March, six months, that would have been like September of 1956 that they actually moved into the house in West Mifflin, and at that time it was my older sister, my brother, and myself and my mom and dad.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 176803
Speaker 1: Now this is one of the questions we always ask:  When you consider your parents' personalities and sense of humor, what they look like and how they walk, how they talk, and, you know, what they were interested in, their talents, who do you think that you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I am my mother's [Jean Barron Sturdivant] child.  (Laughter).  Yeah.  And I call myself a combo baby.  I look like both of them; you know, my family seems to think that I look a lot like my paternal grandmother [Clemmon Dobbins Sturdivant] and my father [O.C. Sturdivant], and when I look I can see that.  But, I also look my mother.  My mother is, of course in her younger days, was a very assertive, outgoing, speaks her mind, you know, very involved in things.  I guess I could say I'm a little stubborn, maybe tenacious.  I'll say that--tenacity.  That's her spirit and her personality.  You don't give up.  No one'll tell you no.  Take the bull by the horns, that kind of a thing.
Speaker 1: Now, was she teaching here in Alabama--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  She ended her, she had a number of jobs, you know, 'cuz there still was a lot of discrimination and she did days' work, but they also believed back then, I don't think it was just a belief, the value, but also the ability because wages were such that you could have one paycheck, you know, one wage earner where the husband could go out and work and the mom stayed home, so, and we, my brother and sisters, we would talk about that.  Apparently, they believed that her role was to get us to school because we were, except for my brother and sister who were three years apart, we're all six years apart, so once we went to kindergarten she would work.  Okay, and then if, another baby--I'm six years older than my little sister, and then my brother is six years older than me, so we were, you know, and I always remember her being, as a young child she'd be home when we got home, you know that traditional kind of thing.  But she also worked and she did a number of jobs--days' work, she was a senior, I call it a senior sitter, you know, help with the elderly and then, as I got older, she was a reading specialist with the school district, which was a perfect job for her, and later on in life when I became, I was a probation officer, and some of the kids, I remember someone said, "Are you related to Jean Sturdivant, Mrs. Sturdivant?", and I said, "yeah, that's my mother."  And they said, "Oh, she taught me how to read."  And I was just so proud of that.  You know, that she was, she said, "I had trouble reading and she really helped me read."
Story_ID: 176804
Speaker 1: Let me ask you to, can you name, well I know you can do it, please name your brothers and sisters from the oldest to the youngest and, you know, put yourself in the order.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And tell us something about 'em, what they're doing--
Speaker 2: Each one of 'em okay.  My oldest sister is Sandra Lynn Sturdivant, and she was born in 1947.  She is now retired.  She is mother of three beautiful children and she went to school for art.  She is a gifted artist.  She also went for nursing and she did art therapy with mentally challenged individuals and she did nursing, and we always teased her.  We still tease her that she's just a school person.  She'd just keep going to school, getting different kinds of degrees but she's now retired.  My brother, the next one, is Otis Charles Sturdivant.  He was born in 1950.  He passed away and--
Speaker 1: And his name flushes out your father's O.C. [Sturdivant], (laughter) even though your father's name doesn't really stand for that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and my mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] said that was always her hope, that my dad would change his name, but he never did and my brother worked different jobs as a laborer, and he was the type of individual that he marched to the beat of his own drummer.  He does admit, well, I believe, we called him, in the community his nickname was Professor and Clyde, 'cause he could just--
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was laborer, but he was a professor.  Does it seem, I mean, in the sense of--
Speaker 2: Yeah, he could just speak on anything and they used to play a game.  Someone would select an object, and they would just ask him to speak about it, and he would go on and on.  But a child in the '60s [1960s], lots of turmoil there, you know, and opportunities not realized.  But, he was very humorous, had a great sense of humor.
Story_ID: 176805
Speaker 1: Then--
Speaker 2: Did he [Sturdivant's brother, Otis Charles Sturdivant] have a chance to go to school at all?
Speaker 1: He went.  He didn't graduate, but he went.  Vietnam [War] came about.  He refused--
Speaker 2: Did he go to school here in the city in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes, we all went to, for high school, West Mifflin High School.  It was called West Mifflin North.  It's now called West Mifflin Area High School [West Mifflin, Pennsylvania], and out little community was just, and I said I'm gonna write about our little community one day, it was a little enclave of middle-classed African American families, very small, in a larger suburban white community, and it was, you know, families related to other families, but a strong sense of family and it was, you know, the old adage, "it takes a village," and all of that.  That, you know, where I grew up really, I think that that was true.  That, you know, was a time when anyone, literally any of those parents could have chastised us if we, you know, anyone, and we were expected to be respectful, you know.  But the other part of it, you know, people always talk about, "Oh, if we did something, Mrs. So-and-So would do this before we got home."  The other part, though, it's not just a punishment, it was also the support.  You know, people cheered for us, they motivated us, you know, they all felt responsible.
Story_ID: 176806
Speaker 1: But we went to this high school [West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania] under this school system, and I guess if people see this they'll be surprised, but no, they shouldn't be surprised, it was a very racist public school for African Americans, and for everyone, but it was a very difficult school experience and, as children, you're not always aware 'cause, you know, through a child's eye, you know, you just always look at everyone, you know, through rose-colored glasses, but I always had a very keen awareness of when I wasn't liked or people, there was something different and, many times, I saw children now that you can't verbalize it but that doesn't mean that you don't understand that something's different, but we all graduated from there, which I think was phenomenal and when I talked to my other friends during the time and we talk about our experience and the growing up in that neighborhood, we really went through some things and everyone, you know, there is a high sense of achievement for many of the, you know, the residents and I think it was because one, we were clearly in a very good school system; you know, they had a solid education, but two, because when you're the minority and then when you're marginalized at that minority that brought a sense of camaraderie and protection among, you know, between us.
Story_ID: 176807
Speaker 1: I wanted to finish your brothers and sisters, since everybody came out of high school [at West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania] including you, (simultaneous) Otis [Charles Sturdivant], but did he have any college?
Speaker 2: Yes, he went to Community College of Allegheny County [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and, in fact, not too long he had decided to go back, not too long before he passed.  Then it was me.  I was born in 1956, and I went through the West Mifflin Public School System, and then six years later, it was my youngest sister, Kimberly Karen Sturdivant, Davis now, and she went through as well.  My sister graduated from, the oldest sister, Sandra, graduated from the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], The Art Institute of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], Community College of Pittsburgh [sic, Community College of Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], like I said, she just wants to go to school.  I graduated from Point Park, at the time it was College, it's now University [Point Park University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], University of Detroit [later, University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan], and the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and my youngest sister graduated from American University in Washington, D.C., and is pursuing a, she also went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.] for graduate studies and now she's a minister, so she's in school at Wellesley [sic, Wesley Theological Seminary, Washington, D.C.]--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In Massachusetts?
Speaker 2: No, I'm sorry here in [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, we, you know, all of us from these parents who lived in the deep South during segregation, we all went to college.  You know, it's a big thing and my mom [Jean Barron Sturdivant] doesn't make any secret of that, that how she calls it blessings, but I think it's that tenacity and education was so important in our family, oh my goodness, my mom and dad [O.C. Sturdivant] would, you know, just drill it into us and when we played, like family games, it would be like trivia games, those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: You talk about the game with your brother when picking an object and he would talk about it.
Speaker 2: Just talk about it.  We were all trained to, and of course, I, my mother did know.  She's a very bright woman and she would say a liberal arts education is the best.  So, we all received training in the arts.  Now, I was never talented.  But, you know, there were piano lessons, voice lessons, violin lessons, art classes, dance, you know, trips to the museum.  That was a regular occurrence.  You know, I still know the museum here, the Carnegie Museum here in Pittsburgh [Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] like the back of my hand.  Many Sundays that's what we did.  The libraries--we always had to have a membership to the library, so, and books were always in our house; you know, lots of different types of literature and, it's not polite, but we would have dinnertime together, my dad often worked.  We, and this might sound, not politically correct, but we would call him Jamaican 'cause he had his regular job, then he had like five others, you know, so he was always one to go, but we always sat down and had dinner together but we were reading, often reading, and I used to think after I got, you know, big and important, I thought, well this isn't a proper dinnertime but, you know, even now today I'll see myself, you know, I'll be eating and reading something.
Story_ID: 176808
Speaker 1: But, yeah, we went through this school system and--
Speaker 2: Now, where did you start, what was the name of your first school?
Speaker 1: Homeville Elementary [School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania].  Picture, 'Petticoat Junction,' you remember that old TV show?  (Laughter).  That was Homeville Elementary.
Speaker 2: That was Hooterville.
Speaker 1: Hooterville, yes!  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, you're in Homeville.
Speaker 1: I'm in Homeville, and it was so much like it and no disparaging remarks about it but it really was a very small, sort of country-like school now, and all of us went through that, all my brothers and sisters.  My kindergarten was a one-room schoolhouse and it looked like something off of Nickelodeon, with the bell, et cetera and so on, and--
Speaker 2: So, it was just kindergarten in that room--
Speaker 1: Well, that was separate from the big school, which was just next door, grade one through six.
Speaker 2: Because it was actually in a separate little building?
Speaker 1: Separate building, yes.
Speaker 2: So was that separate building the original school, do you know?
Speaker 1: Yes, and it still stands there.  Of course, it's empty and, you know, they've used it for different businesses, and so on but, it, when I was a probation officer, I had the opportunity to go back to some of these schools that, and you know, like your vision as a child, I used to think it was so big, but then when you go back as an adult, you say, "Oh, my goodness, how small it was."  But the little schoolhouse to the side was the kindergarten and then the elementary school was just, you know, it was in the same lot or whatever.  That was grades one through six.  I went to junior high.  That's when they called it junior high--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Now wait a minute.  Let's talk about grade school first.
Speaker 1: Grade school, okay.
Speaker 2: Now, did you like school?
Speaker 1: I loved school.  I've always liked school.  Even though I say I love the smell of chalk.  I love school.
Speaker 2: You could have been resentful little kid and not liked it 'cause your parents pushed it.  You definitely liked--
Speaker 1: Oh, no.  I liked going to school.  I was good at it and you didn't have an option, and I think kids just have a different perception of school, you know, anyway.  And then as a child, you didn't, you know, a lot of times, I think that's why I'm so protective of children now.  You don't understand as a kid, but I look back at some of the things that they did to us were, I mean, the African American students, were just horrendous.
Speaker 2: Was this an integrated school?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was integrated, but it was a very small percent of African American students, and I teach this all over now, and I see that difference that, when communities like that have, when they're the dominant culture and you have a small enclave of African Americans, you're accepting of those blacks; you know, like, "These are our blacks," okay, "'cause we know them," (laughter) but, you're not necessarily wedded to embracing other, you know, blacks.  But my elementary, junior high, and high school experience was oftentimes, well more so in junior and particularly high school, I would be the only African American student in the class.  That wasn't uncommon--
Speaker 2: So as a result, you weren't mistreated, you're saying.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, I was, yes.  Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Not discriminated against, basically?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I was discriminated against-oh yeah, oh yeah!  But, you know, as you get older, you start to understand it, and I did have the luxury of having an older brother and sister who were, you know, like I said my brother was six years older than me and my sister was nine years older, my oldest sister, so when the end of the day would come through, they knew well here's another Sturdivant kid coming through, and that worked out for all of us, I think, because my parents were very involved, particularly my mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] was very involved in the education of her children.  At school, she was always at the school, and they knew her, not necessarily embraced her all the time because she would be there, you know, advocating on our behalf, but I was at a young age very politically aware of the difference between black and white student treatment, very much aware.
Story_ID: 176809
Speaker 1: Now you started school in '62, [1962], I guess, right?
Speaker 2: In '62 [1962], yeah, '61 [1961], '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Kindergarten, first grade [at Homeville Elementary School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania]--
Speaker 2: Kindergarten, and I remember, and that's why they, I'm very much for diverse classrooms, because I remember being different than the other kids, and there were other African American students there, but I now, there might have been six of us, six or seven of us.
Speaker 1: And how did they--can you tell us the story of about how--about how they treated you?
Speaker 2: Oh, where do you want to start?  There was, now this was when I was, I guess, I'm trying to think of when The Beatles, when did The Beatles--
Speaker 1: In '64 [1964], that's when they appeared on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.'
Speaker 2: Okay, so I might have been second or third grade.
Speaker 1: Second or third grade?
Speaker 2: Second or third grade, right, and that's about right. Back then they had, you know, you had recess, although I don't know if kids still do, but recess out in the playground and, again, we maybe couldn't speak of it, but African American students, and you know, we would hang together.  Now, here you're seven or eight years old, but you would be on the playground together, and we also lived in the same little section of the community.  Anyway, they, you know, we were, the boys were doing whatever they're doing, running around, whatever, and the girls are, you know, talking, jumping rope and they had little cards.  They were, I guess, like trading cards or whatever, of The Beatles and, of course, I wasn't into The Beatles 'cause Motown was around, you know.  I was seven or eight years old (laughter) but these kids were into The Beatles and I remember two little red-headed girls.  They were twins, and the teachers just doted on these kids, these two twins, and we were all very curious about this, The Beatles.  You know, who are these people and why are they, you know, so important.  Everybody loved The Beatles and they're singing about The Beatles and John [Lennon] and Ringo [Starr], and all of them, who they knew, and the one little girl, she, one of the twins, I remember, her--I had one of the cards in my hand and she pulled the card, snatched the card out of my hand and she said, "You can't watch The Beatles, they don't like you."  Yeah, and I thought, well why not?  I mean, I'm--then she says, "They don't like coloreds."  Yeah, you know, the whole thing, and I just remember being so hurt by that, but also angry and when she snatched a card, I pushed her, you know.  Don't snatch me, and then she hit me and, of course, that's when the teacher came in and instead of addressing mutual combat, she made me sit out in time out and I never liked that teacher after that, and I tried to, you know, explain whatever and that made a difference, you know, from I think that point on.

Speaker 1: During that same school experience at that elementary level, we were on the playground once and this little girl said to me, "Are you brown like that all over?"  (Laughter) and I said, "Yeah," and she says, "No."  And I says, "Yes, I am."  And that time, we wore dresses.  You didn't wear, you know, and I lifted up my dress to show her clearly that I was brown all over and she was rubbing, like my stomach and, you know, "Yeah, you are. Does that come off?"  I just thought she was about the dumbest thing that ever, ever happened, and, again the teacher came over and scolded me about that.  Yeah, I can still picture that teacher.  I don't want to say her name, 'cause she might have--but I loathed that woman.  I just, ugh, she was very evil.  But, throughout that whole elementary period, I can remember what I was singled out for, for being African American, not just me but the other students and frequently called, "nigger" in earshot of a teacher, you know, by another student, was that nothing was ever done.  I never, think I was paddled once on the hand, one teacher, and I remember her looking like she wore those Eleanor Roosevelt dresses with the long dropped waistline and those oxford shoes.  Oh, I was terrified of her.  And, she sat us, now that was the first grade.  She sat us in the rear, the African American students, in the rear of the class, and I knew that there was something up.  You know, like is this just by chance, and there was one of my classmates, a neighbor kid, he has since passed away.  For some reason, they did not like that kid, and they would just pick on him all the time and we would be very disturbed as first graders.  I remember one time she took that yard stick and just whaled on him and we all cried and just cried, you know, and you know it's fear, but you don't know that as a child, you know, to speak out.  Anyway, by the time I got to, I remember in the fifth grade, a teacher was talking about the different neighborhoods in that little community and she said that--and she would always make these very racist remarks and she had the reputation for not liking African American students and we knew that, and you asked about my dad's name, O.C. [Sturdivant] and they would go around and ask your father's name, your mother's name, et cetera and she said, "Well, what kind of name is that?  That's not a name."  And I said, "That's my father's name," and you know, she said, "well, that's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard of."  Yeah, and I responded back to her and promptly got sent to the office after I said something like, "Well, that's my father's name, don't laugh at my father's name."  And got sent to the office.  Didn't like her either, and she made a remark about how students, she was riding through Homeville [Pennsylvania] and she saw a rat and the Homeville was part of it and she saw a rat and the Homeville was part of it, of course, it was black and white, and I remember getting in a discussion.  I said, "Well, have you driven through any parts and seen a rat?"  And she says, "No, just in that section."  And we just could never quite get along, but the fact that I was such a good student, it seemed to irritate her, you know, a little bit.
Story_ID: 176811
Speaker 1: And I was in sixth grade and my sister, by this time, was very much into the Civil Rights Movement.  This was 1968.
Speaker 2: Your sister is like six years older than you?
Speaker 1: Nine.  My oldest sister is nine years old.  So she's not a high-schooler and also my, she's in college by that time.  I had a cousin.  We had one family of cousins here on my mother's side, who was the only real family, birth family that we had, blood family, and he was killed in Vietnam and he was like a--you know, 'cause we grew up, we were so close that my cousins and my aunt and uncle, and he stayed with us a lot.  You know, he would, 'cause he was about the same age as my brother and he was like, you know, a brother to us, my cousin, and he was killed in Vietnam.  That changed our family.  It changed my aunt and uncle.
Speaker 2: In sixth grade, you were how old?  In 1968?
Speaker 1: Twelve, in 1968.  I remember, yeah, February 1968.  He was killed in Vietnam, and that was the one traumatic event, I think, to our family, that just changed, you know, everything changed after that, but I became very angry, you know, and it was during the civil rights.  You know, the--
Speaker 2: April, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] would be assassinated.  Can you remember--
Speaker 1: Oooh, I do remember that.  I remember when JFK [President John F. Kennedy] was assassinated.  I didn't know what was, like, going on but I remember the teacher.  She was a lovely, she was my second grade teacher, and I remember them making an announcement and she came into the classroom first and she was crying and then they made the announcement and we all had to leave.  But that was a time when, you know, that kids would just go home alone or whatever, but I went home and I remember we had to be very quiet in the house.
Speaker 2: That was from the JFK incident?
Speaker 1: From the JFK.  I remember that trauma, but the assassination of Martin Luther King was also very traumatic time period and I remember us being, you know, we went home and lots of hushed discussions in our house between our parents [O.C. Sturdivant and Jean Barron Sturdivant].
Speaker 2: How did the teachers--were you in school when you found out or--
Speaker 1: Yes.  Now, they would deny it, but I remember, you know, people always look now at Martin Luther King as the Great Peacemaker and everything, but white people to my recollection didn't embrace him.  It was sort of like he got what he deserved.
Story_ID: 176812
Speaker 1: And I say that because I did an essay.  I was, you're graduating from the sixth grade and you have to do this essay and I had this influence of my sister, you know, the death of my cousin, the assassination of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.], all these things are going on and I did a story on H. Rap Brown--
Speaker 2: For--
Speaker 1: --for my project, my sixth grade project, and (laughter) I'll never forget the look on her face, the teacher, "Why are you writing about H. Rap Brown?"  Like who--and she just marked it up and said, "No, this is unacceptable to write on this, you know, this person."  And I just refused.  "This is who I wanted to, you said that we could write about anything and," you know, she, I just, the things that they do to children, and I remember my sister and I, we were researching, and she says, "Well, you know what?  We're gonna do all of 'em then."  So, I combined H. Rap Brown, I did Martin Luther King, Stokely Carmichael was another one, and I talked about the Black Panther, you know, no--that was later on--, 'cause there were three individuals that I did, yes, and when I took it back and it was a--I remember it took a lot of time and there had been an article in Jet magazine about him, she refused to accept that.  She said, "You'll write about a good American."
Story_ID: 176813
Speaker 1: Now, through this school experience--I kind of get the point about what's going on here, but were there any teachers that were, you know, that took an interest in you or tried to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Actually during the sixth grade, we had the library teacher, the librarian was the one that we had to do this report, book report on, but my sixth grade teacher was a very good teacher, Mrs. Albright (ph.), and she lived in our little neighborhood. She was tough as nails, but she had very high expectations for her students and I never, ever remember her expecting anything other than excellence.  If I had to say anything negative, she would say, "You can do better than this."  She used to always quote, she loved my brother, and that used to irritate me, but she said, "Oh, we wouldn't have done this," you know, or he would have been better than that on this, and I think she just appreciated good students, 'cause she always encouraged me and she, I'm assuming she has since passed, but when I graduated from college, every time she saw my name in the paper for something she would send me a card, to my mother's [Jean Barron Sturdivant] house.  I think that's an educator.  You know, she would always note I'm so proud of you, and that was long after I had worked, you know, started working, whatever she would send.
Story_ID: 176814
Speaker 1: But, you know, being called nigger, we would have our, you know, we had fights a lot of times.  I remember walking behind when I was in the tenth grade walking behind a teacher and he didn't know that I was there and there had been a little scuttle in the hallway between some students, because it was a lot of racial tension.  Most times it was peaceful, but there was a lot of racial tension and they said, "Well, what's going on?"  He said, "Oh, just those niggers acting like the savages they are."  Oh, my God!  And he was talking to another teacher and he turned around and he saw me and I just felt such disdain for him and he would always try to, after that, make conversation with me and I just couldn't, you know, bear to have it.  But, in the same vein, I remember in the ninth grade I had an excellent teacher and he was an old [U.S.] Army sergeant, and he wore his hair with that, looked like Sergeant [Vince] Carter, you know, from Gomer Pyle [characters on 'The Andy Griffith Show'] with the crew cut and he was my algebra teacher.
Story_ID: 176815
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your junior high school?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Homeville--Junior High [Homeville Junior High, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania]. (Simultaneous) Homeville Elementary--
Speaker 1: Was that in the same building?
Speaker 2: No, oh, that was the big school.  You had to walk to that school a good ways.  And we would all get up in the morning and meet each other at the playground and then we walked to Homeville Junior High, home of the Homeville Mustangs and that little walk to school we had many adventures and lots of good times, and I remember I had a great childhood.  I have to say that.  There was a lot of, again in school there was a lot of, you know, racial tension and reminders that you were African American, but overall I had very good, just sort of an idyllic childhood, you know, school experience.  But, I remember once we, there was always the houses that you remembered and one was, this guy, this man would make sport out of letting his dog run out.  The dog was on a leash but he would allow the dog to run out just far enough.  If you didn't get off and jump away, you know, he'd nip you, and I remember one day was, I guess it was just that day.  We said, you know enough's enough, so someone started to yell at the dog and, you know, I don't know if somebody, we might have thrown rocks at the dog or something and by the time we got to school, and the wife came out and she called us every racial slur you could think of, you know, and by the time we got to school the principal calls us in and he was a very nice principal, but he wasn't going to tolerate these African American students harassing these white neighbors, and I remember saying, well, I said, "You're not going to hear our side of the story?"  And he said there's, "I don't need to.  She's an adult."  I said, "She's a white adult."  And, oh that made him so angry, and he had gone on to talk about his friends who were the best friends who were, you know, colored and oh, whatever, and one thing that I have to say that principals, teachers, school systems, they back off when they know they have parents that are involved, and I remember going home and I told my mom [Jean Barron Sturdivant], and my mother was always at the school fighting, you know, with them, and not tolerating, you know, that, and people sort of, he certainly apologized, no, that's not what he meant, and whatever.
Story_ID: 176816
Speaker 1: But it was the same principal who--I wore the first dashiki to school.
Speaker 2: Well, this is a story--
Speaker 1: Yes, I had a dashiki 'cause, again, I had this older sister who was really into the movement.
Speaker 2: Now, she's in college at the time?
Speaker 1: College at the time.
Speaker 2: Where did she go to school?
Speaker 1: At that time, she would have been at The Art Institute at Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and she made a dashiki for me and I had an afro.
Speaker 2: So who is--let me ask you--a historical question now, what were some of the dynamics of the Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] African American community--was there, like a leader of a Black Nationalist Movement, or was CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], I mean what was the major organization that you remember from --
Speaker 1: There was always the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  Pittsburgh is a little different than some of the larger cities.  I call it, and I read a book from a professor at Duquesne University [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], called Comfortable--well, he terms this "comfortable captivity," when you're doing a little bit better, you're not necessarily cognizant of the degree to which you're marginalized and I think that that's the best way I can describe the Pittsburgh community at the time.  There were, there was a small [Black] Panther Party here but not clearly to a degree of some others, and different social and civic organizations, and I remember some of the, you know, the icons of the day like, you know, Nate Smith, Frankie Mae Jeter, yeah, Mr. Adams [Harvey Adams, Jr.] from the NAACP, but that's more radical; of course, I'm a child, but more radical, I don't remember the degree to which I had, you know, read about in other cities.
Speaker 2: Would you consider your sister to be in the Black Arts Movement although there's--
Speaker 1: Oh yes.
Speaker 2: She's the artist, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  She, that wasn't necessarily something that was embraced by my parents.  It was more, even though they were, particularly my mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] was very outspoken, I would think she came more from the Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] school of thought, you know, and I remember my sister being very Malcolm X, I remember her celebrating Malcolm X's birthday--
Speaker 2: Now, was she involved with, was it a black student organization she was involved with or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, she had, she had, I remember one Sunday, which was our day to all be together as a family, and we were sitting out in the yard on a lazy summer afternoon, and my father [O.C. Sturdivant] was there with his pipe reading his paper and he could read the stock market, which I could never quite understand, that was with the numbers, but I could never get that.  He was a man with limited education but could read the stock market; anyway, we're sitting there quietly 'cause that's what you did on Sunday, you sat quiet, you had family time, and she came up the street in a car filled with lots of young people and they had on berets, boots, (laughter) and like these fatigue-looking things and I thought my daddy was just about gonna die right there (laughter) and she gets out of the car with this big afro and dashiki, "Power to the people!"  My father said, "What is she, a revolutionary!"  (Laughter).  I just revered her.  I just thought this is the coolest thing, this is the greatest thing and that wasn't the route that they saw at the time, you know, to go but, yeah, she, you know, I have to credit her with really exposing me to what was going on. You know, the movement, and then I love to read too, and you know, kept up on things.  It was just, it was just a tumultuous time and a very exciting time.
Speaker 2: Was there a black book store in the city?
Speaker 1: No, now, you know my first exposure to black literature was through my mother, because that was her experience growing up.  Like, you know, I read Paul Laurence Dunbar, Richard Wright, James Baldwin.  Those books were in our house, which we didn't get that at school.  Certainly not in the school system I came up with.  So, by the time I got to college, I was familiar with a lot of the authors but, again, I think that that was just unique because those are the, you know, things that we grew up, you know, reading and so on.
Story_ID: 176817
Speaker 1: But, I remember having, you know, an afro, like I said, a dashiki, and being told I could not wear that to school.  Another trip to the school by my mom [Jean Barron Sturdivant].
Speaker 2: They told you that you couldn't wear a dashiki to school?
Speaker 1: No, can't wear that.  Inappropriate dress.  Couldn't wear that.
Speaker 2: So, what was appropriate dress in the school?  A uniform or something?
Speaker 1: No. But that was just too, I guess, ethnic or whatever.  Clearly an afro wasn't.
Speaker 2: An afro itself, was that banned or did they--
Speaker 1: They didn't want you to wear that.  He didn't want me to wear that.  Of course, I didn't stop wearing it and my mom said that, you know, it was inappropriate for him to say that I couldn't wear it. I later became a cheerleader in this school and, at the time, it was, "Y'all cheerleaders have to look uniform."  I couldn't be uniform.  You had to wear your hair in a little bun. Well, I had a little afro puff (laughter) and here, my poor mama too, I can remember, they, we were getting weighed and measured our height and the nurse put the yardstick through my afro puff and I grabbed that yardstick and she saw that as an act of, you know, aggression.  I went home and told my mom, mom back up to the school, and I guess I could say I was just always steadfast that you're not going to abuse me or treat me differently.  I was very much aware of mistreatment.  Now some people were, you know fearful and you know, there's many times you didn't say anything 'cause, you know, if you address it all the time you, you're just crazy but, you know, we see this as a child.  It's, you know, quite disturbing.
Story_ID: 176818
Speaker 1: High school, too, I think it gets a little bit more competitive in high school.
Speaker 2: West Mifflin [North] High School [later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: West Mifflin, it was called West Mifflin North.  Now, I want to say too, though, that there were very beautiful, great teachers there too, who took pride in the fact that they had bright students, very bright students, and I remember one of my childhood friends.  He's now a dentist.  I don't, I believe he's living in California somewhere, but he was just brilliant and we all took such pride in his academic abilities, but we also felt very strongly that he was cheated out of being valedictorian, because they made one of the, another student who was, because he's you know, college prep, advanced placements or whatever, and then another student was business, or secretarial, which was a thing back then, which didn't compare, you know.  Calculus doesn't compare, not to say that it's a lesser, but you know there's a different academic rigor to it, and we just felt, you know, cheated with that, but I think all of the African American students at that time, by the time we got to high school, we clearly understood that this is about survival and sticking, you know, together.  The only time I ever recall my father [O.C. Sturdivant] tearing up was when he, because he, like I said he worked all the time, but I was a cheerleader, which was very prestigious back then.  I wouldn't let my kids do it now if I had a girl, but, and I was the only African American, of course, and we went to a neighboring school, another all white school district, and you know during basketball you run out and, you see in the movies, they run out to the middle of the court and my father was in the stands, you know, to see this, see me cheer, and very proud, and someone yelled out, "Aunt Jemima [ph.]." And I could see him stand up, you know.  And, you know, when we got home, as we were driving home he, I guess it was just bothering him so much and he was trying to rationalize it, but he said, "Baby, you don't, you don't even look like aunt Jemima."  (Laughter) I said, of course, no one--who does look like Aunt Jemima?  (Laughter) but it was just his way of expressing this pain, like how dare you, you know call, 'cause he was quiet, but my mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] was the, the fighter, the black fighter, so to speak, but did it from a very straightforward way, but also instilling a sense of pride in who you were as an African American.
Speaker 2: And it was also our guess, now, were there more black students in high school than any other (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, my graduating, no, 'cause it was the same kids.  Okay, I should take that back.  There were some other African American students from another portion of that community, of that borough, but it still didn't increase it a whole lot.  When I graduated from high school there were twelve African American students out of a class like three hundred-and-something.  We were clearly, you know, the minority, and students, I remember having very close, warm relationships with other students.  You know, white students. And I think kids can get stuff together.  It's, you know, the adults.
Speaker 2: Now, the white students, I would guess, at least a portion of them would be going through sort of a counter culture activity in 1968 and beyond.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, '71 [1971], '74, [1974], yeah.
Speaker 2: You came out in '74 [1974]?
Speaker 1: I came out in '74, [1974], yeah, and that was, you know, we didn't care about anything too much then.  You know, that was the blue jean, hippie, back to nature, whatever, but I--
Speaker 2: A kind of counter establishment culture.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there were students who were, you know, we all just got along, had good relationships; like I said, I was involved in a lot of school activities so, you know, I knew a lot of white kids, liked a lot of the white kids.  They liked me, and so on, but there was also that other, you know, element.
Story_ID: 176819
Speaker 1: And I had, I remember having a real good friend, he was Italian.  He must have been first generation Italian here, 'cause his parents spoke Italian, and when I, that was the ninth grade [at West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania], and that was something, that was a ritual.  At the end of the school year they put on the back of your report card the class that you would go to for the following year, the teacher, your homeroom teacher, and we would stand there, you know, on our way home under the streetlight and look to see where we were gonna be assigned, 'cause that meant, who's the other black person you know that's gonna be in your classroom.  I mean, this is terrible (laughter) I know-- and we'd go, "Okay, okay." And then it was two of us.  I still have conversations with this person, so when I got, when we reported to school that fall, he ran to me and said, "They transferred me out."  And I thought, "Oh my God."  That meant that I would be the only African American student in this classroom.  Now, you know, if you're an adult that might not sound--you fourteen or fifteen years, that's a big deal, especially when there's, you know, all that tension.  So, you know, we're sitting in a classroom and the students, some of the white students are huddled together and this one, I can still picture this kid.  When I came in, he says, "Well good, we only have one left."  Yeah, and the teacher I was telling you with the crew cut, he heard that kid say that and he went off on that kid, you know, and I just felt so supported.  He said, "You should be lucky that she's here.  She'll bring the grade point average up," and you know, that teacher always was connected to me.  He always stood for me.
Speaker 2: What was it, mathematics?
Speaker 1: Mathematics, yes.  He stood for me and always tried to, you know, motivate me and I have very fond memories of him.
Speaker 2: So, now you were a--what was his name?
Speaker 1: Mr. Caldwell [ph.].
Speaker 2: Mr. Caldwell.
Speaker 1: Mr. Caldwell, yeah.  He was, my perception as a kid, he was a portly kinda stocky guy, but real strict and real stern, but a real good teacher and always, always was very kind to me.
Story_ID: 176820
Speaker 1: Now were you, now you made good grades in school, you were saying, and were you honor roll?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, yeah, that was the expectation, so, and I worked very, you know, very hard too, because that was sort of an escape for me.  I had very strict parents that, we were very much into the church.  You know, my mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] is a licensed and ordained minister.  She's retired.
Speaker 1: Now, was she as such when you were in school?
Speaker 2: Yes.  She, we were always church people.
Speaker 1: Now this is the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal]?
Speaker 2: No.  She was in the Pentecostal Church, and she, 19--I believe she was licensed in '68 [1968] and ordained in either '69 [1969] or '70 [1970].  And that, you know, back then women just weren't in the ministry, and it was a little different because it wasn't that charismatic movement, you know, back then but we were, that's where we were.  We were always in church, Monday we were in church, Tuesday we were in church, Wednesday we were in church, Thursday we were in church, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday we were in church all day, you know.
Speaker 1: So then the church, on some level, bridged the gap between the social life in high school [at West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania] and--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because the church is the one institution that just only sees the good in you; you know, like uplifts you.  At least, that was my experience.  And I met so many different characters, you know, and we had church stories.  We would play church.  My brother could imitate anyone in church and we would just sit there and laugh outside of my mother's earshot, because that would be another beat-down, but we had fond memories of church people and church people, you know, when you, when it comes to kids, children, good solid church people, they look at the kids in the church as their kids, and you know, I just remember, you know, church people passing me a dollar here or, you know, "Oh sweetie," you know, "y'all look a little tired, go on down to the store and get you something."  You know, that kind of thing, so, you know you develop this perception that adults are caring and protective, you know, and so on, and then, you know, they'd make a big deal of when you graduated, when you made the honor roll.  You know, it was a big deal and I've carried a lot of those values with me because the, you know, church was very, very supportive.  But, we weren't, you know Sunday was always a day of rest.  It was to sit still--
Story_ID: 176821
Speaker 1: You know, you go to church.  We lived not too far from an amusement park.
Speaker 2: What was the name of it?
Speaker 1: Kennywood Park [West Mifflin, Pennsylvania]. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Kennywood Park. Okay. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Kennywood Park, yes.  And, in fact the schools, the high school [West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania]  and the junior high [West Mifflin junior High School] sort of sat up over the hill from this amusement park and, you know, you could walk from our home to this amusement park, and in that time you could just walk in.  You didn't need any money.  You could just walk--ride--they had tickets, ride tickets, and they were like a penny apiece, two cents apiece, a nickel apiece, or whatever.  And so, you know, a day at Kennywood, you could just walk through, maybe for a buck and ride and eat and have a good time.  We were never allowed to go on a Sunday, and I thought that that was the most terrible thing that could happen.  We can't go to Kennywood on Sunday, and I snuck out once with a group of our, with my girlfriends, and we walked to Kennywood and went to Kennywood, and by the time we got back, the news was out that we had gone to Kennywood.  Wooo. And I was pretty old.  I was in high school, and I remember getting a spankin' for that, oh yeah, 'cause Mr. White [ph.], my girlfriend's father, who we walked by and we lied to, he said, "Where you guys been?"  "Just walkin'."  (Laughter) just walkin'.  And, he said, "Now I already know where you've been."  I remember him telling me he said, Naw." And he scolded me.  He said, "You goin' home.  Your mom's [Jean Barron Sturdivant] waitin' for you," and he just started in on my friend, Yvonne [ph.], and by the time I got home it was pretty much a done deal.  But, those were the things too.  I understand, you know, discipline.
Story_ID: 176822
Speaker 1: So, you lived in a, your community was a small, like a pocket of black people in a larger, middle class white community.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Uh, now what were your aspirations in high school [at West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania], and what did you want to do?
Speaker 2: First, a plumber.
Speaker 1: A plumber?
Speaker 2: Ummm-hmmm.
Speaker 1: Why a plumber?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).  Because someone came to this school career day, and they talked about the lack of plumbers and how much money plumbers made, and I thought, "This is the way to go."  Well, that, of course, was not going to ever happen, 'cause I knew I had to go to college, and I always did want to go to college and my parents thought, "Well, yeah right."  So, college was, and I always took college prep courses and I always wanted to study psychology.  I started--
Speaker 1: Now, why did you have the interest in the psychology develop?
Speaker 2: My mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant], at one time, worked for a psychologist and that sort of peaked my interest, and I always liked to, they always said as a kid I would always analyze things, and they said, "Oh, you're thinkin' too deep.  You know, you're deep."  And I just, you know, I guess it's also what you're exposed to.  But I remember my high school guidance teacher, who was an African American woman, didn't stay there long, and that was something very unusual, for us to have an African American, and she [sic, he] was such a wonderful mentor as was, I should say--he was the first African American teacher in that school district, in that high school.  He later became a vice principal and a principal, and, oh, he was like God to us.  He was also my social studies teacher and that instilled a lot of interest in the field.  He was just phenomenal and so dignified, too.  We were just so proud.
Speaker 1: And what was his name?
Speaker 2: Bert Ogden, Mr. Ogden.  I know his name is Bert, but his first name was Mister and his last name was Ogden (laughter) and that's what we called him, Mr. Ogden.  He was just, it was something that, of course I learned later on in my studies that, my professional studies, that you have to see it in order to believe that it's possible for you, and he was that for us. "Well, we can be that 'cause Mr. Ogden is that," and he was just smooth, and you know, he was always meticulously dressed.  You know, his lessons were always--you know--up on board, no nonsense.  Didn't take anything from anyone, but very quiet demeanor, but also expected you, you know, to achieve.  So, you know, I had very fond memories of him as a teacher and as an administrator.  But, anyway, this guidance counselor, and I can't recall her name, 'cause she wasn't there that long and I don't know, maybe she might have been an intern or whatever, but she wanted me to go into engineering.  She wanted me to be an engineer, and I, it was the farthest thing from mind.  I sort of--
Speaker 1: Well, let me say that that's actually, that's one of the better guidance counselor stories we've heard from somebody black in a mostly white school.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: The counselor did advise you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause she said that was the thing.  You know, I didn't even know what an engineer was, and it wasn't something that I was interested in.
Story_ID: 176823
Speaker 1: But I did have a teacher, a typing teacher.  That's when they actually taught typing.  I was terrible at it.  I really was.  I was bad at it.  And, that's the old days where you had carbon paper and whatever, but you had to take so many electives, so I took this typing class and this woman was just the teacher from hell.  I don't know how else to say it.  And, there were, I remember a couple of football players in the classroom, and one of them was a friend of mine, grew up, and he wasn't very good at it either and, we would try.  We would really try, but there was also a lot of joking between us and I remember one assignment, I was just going at it.  I was getting this project done and I was typing well, and he reached over and started banging on my keys on the typewriter, and I was so angry with him, 'cause I said this is the one time I could, you know, get a good report and I remember she, you know, yelled at both of us, and I was so angry with him for giving her an excuse, and she said to me, she said, "You black people are talkin' all the time."  Yeah, and I says, "What do you mean, you black--."  I said, you know, "You're just watchin' us talk?  We're the only ones talking?"  And we got into an exchange and we went; in fact, I believe I walked out.  I don't even think she sent me to the--but I went to the principal's office and I just couldn't deal with her.  And, another one of my teachers came down and was perturbed that I had spoken back.  I says, "Well, you know, we don't have to take that kind of treatment."  But, anyway, there was a meeting, and so on, and the typing teacher came down and she said, "Well, you're never going to get a job because you can't type.  You know, you're not good at it, so you'll just never get a job.  You might as well just quit school now."  And I'm thinkin' well, and I looked at her, and I remember looking at the principal and saying, "See, this is what I'm talkin' about."  I says, "Well, I never expected to get a job typing.  I expected to have secretaries."
Story_ID: 176824
Speaker 1: On the verge of graduation [from West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania], what was your counseling in terms of where to go to college?
Speaker 2: HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], again, 'cuz I had this wonderful African American guidance counselor [Bert Ogden] and a small college.  And I remember those aptitude tests, they said that I would be more acclimated to a smaller, you know, college, but I had pretty good, it was good advising, and I ended up going to Point Park [College, later Point Park University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  I was going to go to Wilberforce University [Wilberforce, Ohio], but they had had a tornado that year--
Speaker 1: That was 1974, the year that, at that time, the worst tornado in U.S. history.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And, students were, you know, killed there and it just, you know, it was whatever, my fate.  But I ended up going and going to Point Park college, a small liberal arts college that specializes in, you know, the arts, business, drama, dance, and I have to say, of all my college experiences, that that was the best.
Speaker 1: So, now did you, you went right after--
Speaker 2: Right after high school, yes, oh.  No question about that. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So, did you start that school year, did you go in the summer or start in the fall?
Speaker 2: I started in the fall, yeah.  I took the summer off, started in the fall.
Speaker 1: Did you have to work in the summer at all?  Or did you--
Speaker 2: No.  My mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] and father [O.C. Sturdivant] said my job was to be a student.
Story_ID: 176825
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, so fall of 1974--
Speaker 1: I entered Point Park College [later, Point Park University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and--
Speaker 2: Downtown Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Downtown Pittsburgh.  I stayed at home and commuted in--and it was frightening and I think that that's why I'm so sensitive to how students here, with this organization, how it's not the academics, it's all of the other things that you have to get to the academics that can take you out.  Like, how do you register?  Who's your advisor?  What courses do you take?  Those kinds of things, but, Point Park, because it was so small, all of my professors knew me.  You know, I got to know them.  They took a very personal interest and some of the classes literally, there might be five students in a class, you know, and there's no way that you can't learn.  Now there's a lot of pressure, because if you're one of the five, you can't miss, (laughter) you know, so it worked out for me and I studied hard, but I had good teachers and they were sort of the kind of professors that were that post hippie era, you know.  It's a liberal arts college, so we were used to things with, you know, somebody might be walking down the hallway reciting Shakespeare, 'cause, you know, there were lots of theater arts majors, people with tutus and tights, alternative lifestyles wasn't anything uncommon, but I had a really, really good experience and when I went on to graduate school, I would get, you know, messages back, you know, "Write me. Are you okay? Is there--now did you do well? Is there anything we can help you with?  Did we prepare you?"  I remember the chair of the department at that time, when I went to graduate school.  He, I had a conversation with him on the phone and he wanted to know had they prepared me enough that I felt, you know, that I could compete with the other students in graduate school, and I just thought that that was, you know, so kind and clearly, you know, I could.
Speaker 2: So, at the undergrad level, you were majoring in psychology.
Speaker 1: Psychology.  I majored in psychology.
Speaker 2: That was, did you have any courses in black psychology?
Speaker 1: No, oh no.  They never had anything like that.
Speaker 2: Now, those are the days.  The reason why I ask is because those are the days of the development of The Association of Black Psychologists and books like textbook on black psychology was published and had the work of [HM] Joyce Ladner out there--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Reginald Jones, Dr. Jones, yes.
Speaker 2: Dr. Jones' book, black psychology book.
Speaker 1: Yeah,yeah.
Speaker 2: And you had, what was it, [HM Price M.] Cobbs and [William H.] Grier's, 'Black Rage[: Two Black Psychiatrists Reveal the Full Dimensions of the Inner Conflicts and the Desperation of Black Life in the United States],' that was being published in 1969 or '70 [1970].
Speaker 1: Now, it's funny, not funny but it's interesting, that as liberal as that university, it's now a university, the college is, I may, I came back after I graduated with my doctorate, they asked me to come to teach in the department, and I also developed a class called Sociology of the Black Family.  That may have been the first of that type.  And I still teach that.  I also teach, you know, Social Inequality, which brings in a lot of that, you know, information.  We always wanted something as students at Point Park, to have a, you know, minority student, African American student, professor.
Speaker 2: Was Point Park--oh, so you didn't have any black professors there?
Speaker 1: I never had any and I never knew of any.  My husband is also a graduate of Point Park years before me, but he never had any either.
Story_ID: 176826
Speaker 1: And we had a student union, or student organization, it was called, Student Organization for Understanding Life [at Point Park College, later, Point Park University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  Now that sounds deep.  SOUL, and that was our, sort of our black student organization.
Speaker 2: Now that's interesting.  I hadn't heard that one before.  Student Organization for---(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Understanding Life.  I mean, not that's a small task or anything, understanding life, but, you know, this just like other students, is the need for, you know, African American students to come together and fellowship and problem solve, and, you know, have fun together, but I never felt at Point Park [College, later Point Park University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] that there was any outward racial, you know, tension or biases.  Clearly there were somewhere, but I never felt it and I think because of the nature of the school being a liberal arts, and at the time there were a lot of international students, lots of African and Middle Eastern students there, so pretty eclectic and diverse in that terms, but not as far as African American.
Speaker 2: Now, you stuck with socio--psychology, right?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Stuck with psychology, did well, very involved in, you know, undergrad.  If there was an organization, I was a part of it, and I had a very good experience there.
Story_ID: 176827
Speaker 1: I graduated in May of 1978 [from Point Park College, later, Point Park University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and was interested in studying forensic psychology and, you know, was looking for some programs and universities that could foot the bill, of course, and forensics wasn't as popular as it is today, but I received, I was accepted at the University of Detroit [later, University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan] and they had a small research assistantship, which made the choice for me to go.
Speaker 2: Okay, now can you explain to us what is forensic psychology?
Speaker 1: Forensic is the study of the foundation of, say, why people commit certain offenses or the psychological personality of, say, the criminal mind, and I thought that that would just be so interesting.  Also, forensics, you know, patterns, of criminal behavior, etc.  Well, I went to the University of Detroit, Detroit, Michigan, and went on a research assistantship, worked in, and it was in criminal justice and correctional science.
Speaker 2: And this is--where did the assistantship come from, what was the source of it?
Speaker 1: From the department, from that department.  And, I just, for the chair of the department actually, and I would, for his writings and for his research, I did a lot of the legwork.  Lots of reading in annotated bibliographies, you know, the typical research kind of things to help fund a portion of my tuition there, and a lot of the colleagues of mine in the program were Detroit police officers, so I'm this twenty-two year-old kid from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] in classrooms with adult senior Detroit police, which was a different experience; a good experience, but, you know, when you look back, wow.  They, and the Detroit Police, at the time they were just starting to recover, for a lack of a better word, from a lot of the racial strife from the riots, but there was still a lot of division there--oh, it's raining. But I, I was just a student, you know, and most of my peers were working professionals in, you know, the police department, and many of the class, most of the classes were either in the evening or on the weekends to accommodate the students' work schedules, so I got to know a lot of the police and I have some good memories of some of them, really a great bunch, and also got to understand the dynamic of police officers, you know, some of the nuances of being a police officer.  But I also, you know, appreciated the hard work and the dangerous work, but I knew that I wasn't one to carry a gun, certainly couldn't get through an autopsy or anything like that, so I said well, maybe forensics might not be the thing for me, but I got, you know, I graduated, I doubled up in classes I took, which is unheard of in graduate school, but I had nothing else 'cause again, you know, I was a student so I took eighteen credits a semester and just went year 'round.
Story_ID: 176828
Speaker 1: So you're in the--University of Detroit [later, University of Detroit Mercy] is in downtown Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 2: It's in the West Side, I guess, 'cause it was, yeah, but it's in the city.  It's not downtown, but it's in the city, and it's an interesting school.  It's a Catholic university, Jesuit, and, in fact, there's a school here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] that is similar that they called, at the time they called it the sister school, Duquesne University [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and it reminds me a lot of Duquesne University, where it is an urban setting, beautiful campus, but if you walk outside the boundaries of that campus, you're right in the middle of the "hood," so to speak, you know, and to the urban area.
Story_ID: 176829
Speaker 1: And, I had a little part time job as part of my, you know, studies [at University of Detroit, later, University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan].  I worked with the Detroit Police, I worked in the fingerprinting department, and--
Speaker 2: Now the mayor at that time was Coleman Young, I believe.
Speaker 1: Yes, it was.  Yes, it was.
Speaker 2: So, was there a black police chief?
Speaker 1: Actually, the commander, I guess she must have been the commander overall, but it was a woman, at least where our section, where I, you know, reported to and very nice.  I remember her being very, very nice, but I worked early in the morning.  I had to report, I believe, it was seven AM or something that shift, and I did not realize, you know, being a young woman, very naive, that I would take the bus from school, get off on Beaubien [Street], and walk through Greektown in Detroit [Michigan] to the police station.  Well, that's not the thing to do (laughter) and I remember once, somebody drove by and they called me at the time, some of my colleagues or fellow students, they called me Pittsburgh, and they said, "Pittsburgh, what are you doing?"  I said, "I'm going to work."  "Well, you shouldn't be walkin' down, what are you doin'?"  And, they advised me not to do that, and if necessary they would come and, you know, meet me 'cause they always had that shift, or whatever.  But, I had, I learned a lot and had a good experience, but I also learned this isn't necessarily what I wanted, you know, to do.
Story_ID: 176830
Speaker 1: So, I finished there [University of Detroit, later, University of Detroit Mercy, Detroit, Michigan] and came back to Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: So, you finished in the '80s [1980s] right? Nineteen eighty [1980]? Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I finished, came back, end of '79 [1979], '80, [1980], yeah, finished, came back to Pittsburgh and started working as a probation officer with juvenile court, and loved that job; I really did.  I loved working with the children there and really grasped, was exposed to very quickly an understanding that every kid didn't grow up like I did.  You know, that everyone didn't have two parents who worked, didn't have an opportunity to, say, go to a decent school.
Story_ID: 176831
Speaker 1: What are some of the dynamics of juvenile court in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] in those days?  I know, we didn't--I know, in America we didn't always have juvenile court, I think it was found around the turn of the century in Chicago [Illinois] at Hull House [Jane Addams Hull-House], I mean Hull House helped push the establishment of juvenile court (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. That's basic curriculum in schools of social work, yeah.
Speaker 1: The premise being juveniles are not really--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I saw it evolve over time. Juveniles did not have, actually there's the case, oh gosh, oh this is so embarrassing.  The Miranda and the kid out of Chicago, where they began to Miranda juveniles, 'cause at one time you didn't, kids didn't have the same rights, and that was sort of when I came, you know, into that field, that they, juvenile judges were sort of the fathers, very paternal kind of look that they knew what was best, that they acted in the best interest of the juvenile.  There was no jury and that you, it was more for rehabilitation than rather being punitive.  That was the thinking of the discipline, that there was a source of the juveniles' problems and that's why kids committed certain delinquent acts and there was always two phases to the intervention.  One was a, they called it, investigations and that's where I started; when you go out you have an allegation, you go out and you know, investigate it, so to speak, with the kid, the victim, get statements from everyone and do a social study to determine is there anything within that child's psychosocial history or life, family, that might have contributed to, not only the crime but also, or the delinquency, but how would that impact any kind of rehabilitative measures.
Story_ID: 176832
Speaker 1: It was very interesting and I ran across, of course, thousands of kids and, you know, in different circumstances from all walks of life and began, I really began to appreciate that sometimes you're just the victim of your environment and your surroundings.
Speaker 2: Can you give us an example of a case that illustrated that point?
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was one case, and I always use this and I hope that he's still out there somewhere, that he was a, just a physically beautiful kid, you know, cherub looking; in fact, I remember the psychological of the cherub-looking child, big blue eyes, blonde hair, you know, just a cute little kid.  And that's all he was, was a kid, a little child, and he lived with his father and his father was a mechanic and he worked at, in a junkyard and I knew where this junkyard was because this kid was also, lived not too far from where I grew up, so I was familiar with that neighborhood, that part of the town.  Anyway, he, the routine for the family was for the child to meet his father at this junkyard and stay there until his father got off of work, then they would go to this fast food restaurant, have dinner and go home.  Well, if you're playing in a junkyard, you get greasy right, and you know dirty or whatever, and there was some altercation between this kid and some other kids in the neighborhood, and someone filed a petition against the little boy and said, you know, and the teachers, you know, said he was--I remember them describing him as filthy and unkempt, and the father was a seedy looking character, you know, things like that just irritated me, and what I witnessed, though, was a pure love between a father and his son.  And, I had two, I had an entirely different perception of that family than the courts had or in the school, that granted it's not the Beaver family, but he's taking care of his kid and he's okay, and a lot of the complaints about the child was related to, he lived on the other side of the tracks.  It didn't set well with me, and I, I guess I took up to be a warrior for this kid and, unfortunately he got a very strict disposition, a sentence, and it always bothered me.
Story_ID: 176833
Speaker 1: It just bothered me.
Speaker 2: What had he actually done?
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know how much--well, they said he had assaulted this kid but it was more or less like horseplay, you know, exploratory play.  It was supposed to have been sexual in nature or whatever, but--he was really being penalized more for, and his father--one, the father, which at that time it was unheard to have, be a single parent.  He, they had been divorced and he was also a, you know, he's a mechanic.  I mean, and they thought it was terrible that he's at this junkyard.  I said, well I called it supervision.  "Well he eats fast food." He's eating, those kinds of things, but anyway, they said at the time that he needed, and I understood--I never think that it's malicious, it's just you think that you're doing the best but, like that, there's an Ashanti proverb, "It doesn't matter whether the melon falls on the knife or the knife falls on the melon, the result's the same."  So, even though you think you're helping, you know, that's not necessarily the case, so, he ended up getting sent away for his own good, and I saw that little boy transform from this cute little chubby faced cherub-looking angel to a much more hardened kind of kid and it stuck with me that you, you know, those positions hold a lot of power and you better know what you're doing and you better have a position and be very strong in that position and continue to, you know, argue with that.  It turned out well because I was able to advocate for his release eventually and he went home to his, actually he went home to his mother and I felt real good about that but he, I heard from him later on, long after I had left that system and he was in the [U.S.] Military and doing well in everything and I was glad to hear that. But yeah, the thinking moved, eventually the thinking moved more towards looking at the dynamics of what can be done to prevent children from having to necessarily go into placement, and placements at that time, if you were placed or committed to an institution they didn't even review your case for six months, a minimum of six months.  It's a long time when you're fourteen, fifteen years old.  But, it eventually changed where they started looking at shorter sentences, prevention, and you know, like community-based services, which was a good thing.
Speaker 2: Now, did Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] at the time have a community placement program?
Speaker 1: For a short period of time, yes, there was--now when I was in Detroit [Michigan] that was a big thing.  They called them, I think COPS, I think they called them Community Oriented Police [sic, Community Oriented Policing Services], or something, but they had little mini-stations.  That's what they were, they were mini-stations, and there was--very short-lived, but just not to the magnitude that I recall in Detroit [Michigan], yeah.
Story_ID: 176834
Speaker 1: You--in '85 [1985] you work on your Ph.D., right--
Speaker 2: Yes, started working-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) --and how did that opportunity come about or did you just feel it was time for you to get a Ph.D.?
Speaker 2: Well, no.  When I was in high school [at West Mifflin North, later, West Mifflin Area High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania] and I said I was going to college, I knew that I was gonna get a Ph.D., to pursue.  And I did know enough to know that a bachelor's degree wasn't enough, and this lady that my mother [Jean Barron Sturdivant] worked for was a Ph.D., you know, so I wanted to be a Ph.D.  That really was one of my dreams, so I went into the psychology and education, specializing in developmental psychology, and went to the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  By this time I was working.
Speaker 1: So, you were still working for the probation department?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  Actually then, let me see, I think I, yeah, I started a little bit, yeah, while I was in probation and I also left probation to work for a day treatment program, a sort of a, how can I put this?  Like a reformed school for young juveniles, for boys, and was working on my doctorate during that time.  I was, you know, part time working on a doctorate.
Speaker 1: Who was your advisor at the University of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: [HM] Dr. Jerome Taylor.
Speaker 1: Dr. Jerome Taylor.
Speaker 2: The Great Dr. Jerome Taylor, yes, he's an internationally known black psychologist.  In fact, the Journal of Black Psychology, he has several chapters in there, Jerome Taylor, yes.  He was the chair of my committee and my advisor.
Story_ID: 176835
Speaker 1: And my dissertation was, let me see if I can remember this, (laughter) 'The Role of Parental Level of Aspiration in Mediating the Effects of Structural and Cultural Variables on Parent Behaviors and Child Outcomes.'  Should have given me a Ph.D. just for remembering (laughter) remembering that title.  But it was a study, and it was something that I was always interested in.  When I began to work with families and that was, why do some people do okay?  You know, I would see kids in the same family, siblings, one goes off, they're fine.  The other one just doesn't do so well, or you know how does your neighbor do better than you?  You're in the same environment.  Okay.  And I thought a lot about my childhood experiences, how, why did many of us, even though in those very turbulent times, being marginalized, being the minority, why do so many of us achieve and do well, and that was the research question, so I took a group of African American mothers who were in recovery or, you know, involved in substances and their children and wanted to examine what did they see as the future for their kids.
Story_ID: 176836
Speaker 1: Just say that again, I mean, that was an interesting observation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, when I was in, working with juvenile court, I used to always be curious about how one child didn't fare well and, you know, when you do complete social histories, you look at everyone that lives in the house, the siblings, and you ask about their grades, their outcomes, and the number of times that I would hear parents say, well, this one's in college, this one graduated, this one's working fine.  And I said, "Well, what about Johnny (ph.)?  What happened to him?"  And he says, "Johnny doesn't know but Johnny was adopted."  You know, those kind of things. Now, I'm not a believer in biogenic theories--
Speaker 1: Okay, like a biogenic determinative for behavior?
Speaker 2: Right, hereditary, 'cause that's the first thing they'll say about black folks.  That's why we don't do as well, 'cause it's hereditary.  Okay.  But you start to wonder.  And there's clearly a fine line.  Do you really treat that child the same as your other children, 'cause deep down you know that's not of your blood?
Speaker 1: Or, even a family where there are multiple fathers.
Speaker 2: Right, exactly.  Exactly.
Speaker 1: If you like this guy better than the other guy then maybe--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And it's all, you know, it's environment and there are like personality differences and predisposition.  Also, parents who would, I also find this just amusing--who were divorced, but living in the same house and they couldn't figure out, but the kids would know.  Well, why, of course, they're picking up something, you know.  I think age, too, you know, you're a better parent, maybe, towards the end versus the beginning or you get more free towards the end, you know.  Differences between boys and girls, but anyway, back to this dissertation, I found, I would ask well why, say if you're African American, you're poor, you have low socioeconomic status, you're female, and so you have this issue with dealing with your substances. Why then do those same parents have children that do quite well and then other children don't do well, and the question was how much does race, class, gender have an impact on what you perceive to be possible for your child in the future?  And, I just found, don't say just found because it took forever to get through it, it's what you believe.  If you internalize racism, if you believe all of the stereotypes about what it means to be black, female, and poor, like all of the hype, the stereotypes, then subconsciously you parent your child in ways that support those stereotypical perceptions.  So, it's not where you are, it's what you believe, that means, so if you have a negative view of being black, if you have a negative that, "Oh, I can't ever get out of this," that even without your understanding you impart those perceptions and values on your children and internalized racism was found to be the most significant factor that impacted that your perceived level of how far with the potentialities that your child would have.
Story_ID: 176837
Speaker 1: So, your Ph.D. supported with statistical data this idea that your self-concept in terms of what you believe about, stereotypes determine what your aspirations are.
Speaker 2: Right.  Being culturally connected is the protective factor.  That's the mediant--it protects you from that, but even though your social circumstances might not be different or you're can't change that.  You can't, you're African American, you can't change that.  You can't change how society views you.  But, you have the ability to change how your child views him or herself as being black.  Now, some of it we can't get around 'cause there are so many direct and indirect images, information that comes to us as African Americans that negate who we are.  And the younger you are, the more vulnerable you are because you are seeing it all the time.  The kids, by the age of three to four years old, they already know they're different.  Okay, not from necessarily parents telling them, but what society tells them through media.  So, while you can't influence the environment around you, the media imageries, the stereotypes, you do have the ability to process that or filter that through strengths, and that's why I, you know, I tell parents as African Americans, some part of our culture is about humility and not boasting on yourself, and so on that that's not necessarily something that you want to impart on your children.  You want your kids to be just immersed in positive images, positive statement, people, role models, that's gonna filter out all of that negative stuff.  We have to have a buffer.  You know, when I see kids, you know, I talk to kids now today, I always call them by a term of endearment, "Oh, my Nubian queen, look at you, aren't you beautiful."  "Hey, my brother, my little smart brother."  You have to do things like that because black kids see so much negativity about them as black, that the more you build your self-esteem, the more you build, you know, make their heads big related to black, and then the true history of their people, they're able to say, when they see something on TV, they're able to say that's really not, that's just media.  That's really not black folks, and that's the key that, and they've associated internalized racism with not just negative psychological responses related to your potentialities, your level of aspiration, but also health conditions, hypertension, social interactions like personal, marital discord, alcoholism.  There's a big bevy of research around it, and it's something I've always been fascinated with.  I do a lot of independent research and training and in my classes about stereotypes and, you know, I extend it not to just African Americans, but we have stereotypes about all ethnic groups and races, so the more you believe that stuff, it hurts the individual, but it also, say if you're gonna be a teacher, social worker, or whatever, that if you're coming across diverse populations and you hold these stereotypes in your mind, you're going to react to them in a stereotypical way that doesn't help anyone.
Story_ID: 176838
Speaker 1: Now, to what extent, and I've heard this theory, that black people suffer from the lingering effects of slavery where people are released into like a semi-freedom but with a lot of deficits, broken family, no money, you know, no--
Speaker 2: There's no denying that the impact, you know, slavery existed here over four hundred years in the United States, and we had the worst type of slavery, chattel slavery.  There's always been slavery in the history of the world, but the slavery that was practiced here was the worst type ever, and there's no denying that some of the profile of our communities stem from the residual effects of slavery, but that is the economic condition, the social condition, which can be corrected.  It's the psychological condition that's much more challenging; you know, the slave mentality, 'cause we've been programmed to, for survival or just how society did to control, that becomes part of the American culture.  It's not just black folks thinking poorly about black folks.  It's, you know, the culture.  The, I think you had asked me yesterday, I mean earlier about my name and when you hear that name, Sturdivant, a lot of people assume that that's a "white" person and I can tell you the number of times that my administrative assistant used to laugh, on my door was the marquee "Dr. M. Sturdivant," and then people would come by and they would, you know, I'd be sitting behind my desk and they would pass and then come back and say, "Oh, I was looking for a Dr. Sturdivant."
Speaker 1: In other words, you don't look like Dr.--
Speaker 2: I don't look like, you know--(laughter) and I would be both black and white.  It is so complex.  It's very profound, you know, how we view people based upon physical appearance, you know, tangible variables, that's one thing, but how we process psychologically has an impact both ways vicariously, and I see students, I'm trying to do some work now with students to talk about their aspirations in ways that will elevate them, at the same time negating all of those, you know, all of those stereotypes; yet, we still have a long ways to go.  Now, some of it is the stats that we hear, you know, you're gonna make--statistics say anything, but a lot of the stats about broken homes, single parenthood, no motivation to go to college and all of that, it's just hogwash.  It's how you spin it, you know, I don't know how, I don't know of any biological way to have any children unless it takes a mother and a father, right?  And just because you don't see a father in the household doesn't mean that there isn't a father there, and that's not to say that we don't have some challenges with the breakdown of the family, but I just would caution that we don't look at the black family in such negative terms because we're just a microcosm of what larger society.  Families, period, are disintegrating.  The family as we knew it in the '50s [1950s] to '60s [1960s] to '70s [1970s] is not the same for any population and when something negative happens to the dominant culture, you know, they have a cold, we have pneumonia.  I mean, it's just more pronounced.  But I come from this strength-based school of thought that we have strong, parental bonds.  We, and this is all from [HM] Robert Hill, Dr. Robert Hill, when he did the response to the Moynihan Report [1965], 'Strength in Black Families,' [sic, 'The Strengths of Black Families'] strong kinship bonds.  Kinship is everything to us.  Flexible family roles rather than emasculating men, strong work ethic.  I don't know who works harder than black folks, strong learning orientation, education is still very important to us.  Sometimes we might know the route to get there, or we might not be in systems that help us achieve, but it's still clearly a value and, you know, strong religions.  I think our faith is something that, of all those variables, that we have to hold on to.  Our faith--that's what supported African American families throughout.  That's something that's very important to me.  It's been very important.  You know, my upbringing, but I've seen that sense of the world not having the control as being the one thing that helps people get over, so to speak, that there's someone else, some higher force that has control, you know.  Racism doesn't have, it exists but it doesn't have the control.  Sexism, it exists but it doesn't have the control, all of those things.
Story_ID: 176839
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay. (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: Well, what was your methodology for your study?
Speaker 2: I used a path analytical design, path analysis, okay, and path analysis, I feel like I'm going back to school, path analysis is a methodology that looks at the relationship between different social variables and they are weighted against each other to what extent do they impact on, say "x."  Now, it doesn't say that x necessarily causes y.  It's not a straight, like, correlation, which nothing is.  It doesn't look at that.  It looks at the degree of the relationship between those variables on some condition, and from my study, again, you know cultural alienation or internalized racism, okay, was connected to your socioeconomic status, okay, but of the two, how you thought about yourself, your cultural alienation, had the most significant weight against all other variables.  So, your race didn't, your class didn't, your social position, but your perception about what was possible because you were black had the biggest, you know, impact, and it just makes sense.  You know if you don't think you're capable as a result of being deficient as an African American, then you can't see the future for your child in any large sense, any positive sense.
Story_ID: 176840
Speaker 1: So now, when did you finish your Ph.D. [at University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?  Started in '85 [1985]--
Speaker 2: I started in '85 [1985], '96 [1996], yeah, I graduated in '96 [1996], ten years.  It took ten years part time to do it.  Yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: During this period of time were you married?
Speaker 2: Yes, I got married on October 5, 1985.
Speaker 1: Tell us about your husband.
Speaker 2: My husband's name is Larry Dane Anderson, now senior.  He was born April 26, 1950, and I met Larry while a student at Point Park College [later, Point Park University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  He was an alum there, very popular student.  He graduated several years before me and was also in, you know, part of the administration there and towards the end of my tenure there at Point Park, I began to know him personally rather than as a student.  I went away to college and came back and we dated and we eventually got married.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 176841
Speaker 1: During the time you were working on your Ph.D. [at University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], you had another job you were working on.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I always worked, unfortunate--Well, actually one, about six months, I took about six months to really concentrate on writing my dissertation; but yes, I worked.  If you can do it without working, I would suggest that.  It's more than an undertaking.
Speaker 1: Now you were at the, okay, you were at the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], and at the Allegheny Department of Community Services [sic, Department of Human Services, Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 2: Yes. The Urban League of Pittsburgh, I was just about finishing up.  I was in the throes of my dissertation and was just about finishing up and I worked in the education department and was the director for early childhood education.  At the time when women were really going back into the work force in significant numbers, some bright person said, "Oh maybe child care is necessary?"  But, you know African American women have always worked.  But they needed, you know, there were avenues for people to get child care, but also the discipline recognized that you needed quality child care.  You needed, it wasn't just baby-sitting.  It was about, you know, child development and providing good services there, so we had, at the time I think it was like twenty-six child care centers, early childhood centers, and I loved that, working there too.
Story_ID: 176842
Speaker 1: I then went on and went to the field of child welfare, and stayed with that for twenty-three years, I believe, child welfare.  So, that's what most people know me from, from my work in child welfare.
Speaker 2: Now, is this with the Allegheny Department of Human Services [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Allegheny County Department of Human Services, yes.
Speaker 2: And, the dates we have is that you were there from 1990 to '98 [1998], that's right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, in that position.
Speaker 2: Okay, so in that position to another position.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  I left in, I started in, let me see, '91 [1991] maybe, 1991 and left in 2013.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now you were working to try to heighten public awareness of child abuse in the black community?
Speaker 1: Yes, and that was my role.  You know, I moved up in the ranks. I started off as a district director overseeing child welfare services in the inner city, primarily the African American community, although child welfare is primarily a black and brown situation for people.  And then, I moved on to be second in charge of child welfare, and then later to be first, to be the administrator, head of child welfare.  I still embrace the mission of child welfare.  I think it is one of the most admirable disciplines and professions.  You know, the idea that you will protect children from abuse and neglect that is an unfortunate reality that many of our children still don't have, you know, optimal living conditions and that's what child welfare does.  We're the, you know, we were the voices and the protection for children.
Story_ID: 176843
Speaker 1: Now there was a case that our research unearthed, called Baby Byron.
Speaker 2: Y'all so slick aren't you?
Speaker 1: Okay. Tell us about that case and the dynamics of it.
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, I can't talk about that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because, you know, there is the confidentiality on it, and we were sued as a county [Allegheny County, Pennsylvania] and as an individual, so I can't talk about that, but I can talk about similar cases.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Just about what the policies are--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at one time, you know the discipline moved back and forth, as any discipline, that at one time people thought, in the field, that the best way to protect children was to remove them from their parents, that these are bad parents and we're saving these kids.  Well, they would put kids, remove kids, keep them from their families for years, adopt them out, and then what they found was well, the children didn't get any better.  You know, they, or they were worse off away from their parents.  You know, a lot of kids would come back angry with more problems, disconnected from their families, et cetera.  So then the discipline moved to, well you shouldn't remove them just from the parent.  Maybe you should preserve the family, keep the family and the parent together.  It was called the family preservation movement.  Well, we found out from that to the discipline.  That wasn't always the best because some people just went overboard.  You're trying to preserve the family but you're not looking at the best interest of the child.  You know, that some parents are in situations where they're not capable or willing to provide the best care for children.  You know, all over you would hear horrible stories about these kids going back to these parents or staying with these parents, who just weren't able to be good parents.  And then the discipline moved to a sort of a combination.  You try to keep the families together, but not for the risk of the safety of the child, and you also want to support parents so that they can provide good protection.
Story_ID: 176844
Speaker 1: At the same time, there was a lot of controversy about transracial placements, when they're removing these kids, when children are being removed from their birth families and the National Association of Black Social Workers came out with a very strong statement against transracial placements.  Well, social workers are the, how can I put it, they're the advocates for children.  They're the leaders of social justice, you know, all of these things, and there were two schools of thought, and it could get to be very heated discussions or schools of thought.  Is it wrong to place children transracially when they're in need of a home and to keep these kids in placement, or is it another form of racism or discrimination when you don't place children with white families, black kids with white families, and I have to say that whenever there is a debate about transracial placement, it's always about placing black kids with white families, it's never about white kids going with black families (laughter).  And, you know, here you know, as well as across the country, you know, everybody has their opinion.  People would, you know, debate it.
Story_ID: 176845
Speaker 1: I, personally and professionally, believe that children are best served when they're served in communities and families that reflect their, you know, their race, their culture, and what is this--most like, their family, okay.  And it's not just race. When we remove children and place them in these environments that they don't have any clue about, think of yourself.  If tomorrow, today I tell you tomorrow you're not going to live where you live.  We're gonna put you over here.  You're not gonna work where you work.  You're gonna work here.  No one around you knows you.  No one knows what you like, you know, what's your favorite food, what's your favorite cartoon, what's your favorite TV show, and then expect children to survive and thrive.  It's unfair, but people get sometimes, in my mind they get too mixed up in the whole issue of race and want children to fix what adults have messed up.  It shouldn't be on the backs of children to fix the race problem in the United States.  That's my personal view.  That we still have a kid here, a child, who is in need of a home or an environment that is going to protect and love them, that's going to reduce the trauma to them, and I've always held the position that unfortunately in this country it's still very challenging for African American children.  They're still with the issue of racism.  African American children, when they can go to homes that meet their culture, that's what we should be looking for.  That didn't come off well with many people.  Oh, I remember even, people giving charges of racism, you know, threats, you know the whole bit with it, but I know because I, again, while I never had to grow up in care or anything, I had, I guess the fortunate or unfortunate experience of understanding clearly how harmful racism can be to you, okay, and that for children they just love people.  They can't process some of this stuff, so when you've already been traumatized, you've been taken from your family, parents, your community, what's the next best thing?  It's a family that looks mostly like your family.
Story_ID: 176846
Speaker 1: So, when you're thinking about transracial adoption, it's clear that people can love a child of any color.  This is common sense, and very well-meaning people do, in fact, love these children like they're their own.  My position was always that you better be prepared to address the cultural difference, the racial differences that society has for your child.  You might be very good, you know, a great person, but when your child steps out of your home, you have to understand that the world sees that child as an African American child and they look at that child differently.  Some look at him in a positive way, but most often, you know, there are challenges.  So, it wasn't necessarily a thing that no one who isn't of African American descent can parent a child, but you better be prepared to address those special circumstances.  The other thing is that with African American men, boys, there are different dynamics, and you have to be prepared for what's to come.  So, my position was always that the world isn't right, it is what it is, and I'm not going to jeopardize children's wellbeing because of some ideological-political that put kids where they can most, are most likely to acclimate and feel good about themselves and get through.  That doesn't mean put 'em with poor black families either, but the other thing was that the system never wanted to acknowledge that there was a difference in how we assessed families, that a lot of times values, you know, looking at your socioeconomic status, whether or not it was a two parent family, the type of house you lived in.  If you weren't upscale, people would automatically say, well that's a better home than say, someone living in the inner city, a single parent, and that we all know now that isn't the case.
Story_ID: 176847
Speaker 1: The way I saw of getting around it as well as supporting what I knew, believed in my heart was best for kids was that placing children with their families is the best thing for children and, you know, you can look on the outside, but if you ever had to remove a child from their parent, it is the most traumatic event that forever changes that world's history, you know, and I train this all the time.  Kids will forget birthdays, Christmases, they don't forget the day that you took them from their mom, you know, so you have to do it in a way, sometimes, no mistake.  You have to do it because that's the only way to keep the kid safe, but when you do that you have to think about the child and think about the parent.  Involve the parent in the decision.  Who else can watch your baby?  You're not able to.  Do you have a relative?  So, it's better if you go to grandma's than somebody you don't know.  Common sense kinds of things, and that's the kind of stuff I tried to impart.
Story_ID: 176848
Speaker 1: Before even looking at kinship care, placing with family, what can we do to prevent from having to remove anyway?  Too many children were being removed for just nonsensical, you know, things. Power and control by the social worker/case worker, misunderstandings about cultural behaviors and dynamics.  You look at it as abuse or neglect and it's not, it's just cultural patterns of behavior that you don't understand.  And then, deficit based assessments; if you look at the glass as half empty, that's what you're going to see and large numbers of children were being removed from their parents, so prevention--
Speaker 2: What would be a cultural misunderstanding?
Speaker 1: I have a great story. How do you--how would you look at if someone said to you, this child has failure to thrive.  Failure to thrive is when you, a child measures below the normal in terms of weight, height, health conditions, medical conditions, as well as developmental conditions, and it's as a result of neglect.  So, someone comes to you and says you're, this child has failure to thrive, and it's failure to thrive because the caregiver, the parent is giving the child pot liquor.  Okay, this is what happened.
Speaker 2: Pot liquor being, for those who may not know, is juice from greens or other vegetables left over to pot, right?
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, that was misinterpreted as alcoholic beverages, so when you change culturally from pot liquor to alcoholic beverages, yeah, there's a different response.  But unless you know that culture, and so this one particular instance you know, I said this doesn't make sense to me, 'cause the baby didn't look failure to thrive and he looked very large, fat.  Failure to thrive babies aren't fat. (Laughter).  So, you know when you start to query, ask people, and sit down and discuss, you know, what's your routine?  Not in an accusatory manner, and you know it was a grandma and she said, "You know, I do my prayers," 'cause I could see the stuff in her house, you know all the tracts and her pictures and whatever.  "I watch the news, I do the game show host, and then we have our lunch."  "What do you feed your baby?"  "Pot liquor and cornbread."  Well, if you're not from that culture, you don't, all you hear, and if you come from a deficit based--all you hear is liquor, right?  Then, when you write it down, you write down alcohol.  Well then that turns into something very much different from an act of love, historical cultural behavior, and a very highly nutritious vitamin-rich meal.  Now that was, it turned out to be a good situation, 'cause it was someone near who understood the culture, but how many cases like that, real simple, don't understand the culture and then as a result things happen.  How we communicate, you know, people interpreting silence as compliance or not being interested when silence can be, I'm processing this, I understand who you are as the system, so I'm not saying anything right now.  Okay, 'cause you know, if we talk what can happen.  Or loud voices being misinterpreted as an act of aggression, and with black men, a loud voice, you know, if you'd understand the culture, it's not an act of aggression until you start to make a move towards me, then that's an act of aggression.  Those kind of things are always very perplexing and you have to really understand the cultures, like sleeping patterns.  That's a big thing.  How many people in a bed, a bedroom, respect.  Like I've seen people criticize families where children won't give eye contact, okay, and don't respond because it's disrespectful.  When grandma said to sit down and hush up, you sit down and hush up.  And they'll say, well, that's not an appropriate developmental--from whose prospective?  And those kind of things, you know, happen, would happen all the time, from very well-meaning people.  So, we have to, we can't ignore the fact that race is still an issue in this country.  And, if you're working with any kind of system that makes decisions about where you live, who's your parent, where you're going to go to school, you have to have some discussions in your trainings, you know, about race and I've never made apologies about it, 'cause I think it would be a disservice to let children just fend for themselves.  Children didn't create the race problem, nor should they be expected to fix it.  As adults, as leaders in this system, we have to address it and address it head-on. It's just--
Story_ID: 176849
Speaker 1: Now, to what extent, I know the '90s, [1990s] were--that was the decade that had a crack epidemic hit--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah--
Speaker 1: --hard in the middle of the country and it started in the late '80s [1980s] in the east in [Washington] D.C. and New York [City], and--
Speaker 2: It hit us [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: --and it slammed the Midwest.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, we were about the same time and it changed our welfare significantly because, you know, that's not my area of expertise other than having had a lot of exposure to it, you know, professionally.  I can say crack is the drug that it was an immediate debilitation and a debilitation in a way that you couldn't parent.  You know what I mean?  I'm not supporting any other kind of drug, but it's different in heroin.  Alcohol is very dangerous too, 'cause people do strange things, you know, when they're drunk, but crack, it just, you know, it just devastated some of our communities.  You know, people couldn't work, didn't want to work.  Kids suffered, families suffered.  And it depends on, you know, what theory you used, the conspiracy theory or anything, and I can't get into that.  I just know that it was a--it took a devastating blow.  It continues to take a devastating blow.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) (unclear) compound all these issues of people not being able to parent, grandmothers raising, you know, a younger generation--
Speaker 2: Or, yeah.  And doing whatever it would take to get that next hit and children, your role as a mother or a father didn't take precedence.  You know, and that's not necessarily the case with other drugs, yeah.
Speaker 1: It was a '90s [1990s] phenomenon.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 176850
Speaker 1: But the Allegheny County human services department [Department of Human Services, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania] made a big transition in '97 [1997], is that correct?  I mean, that's a note here I have.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: It was divided into five different--
Speaker 2: Oh, yes.  Okay, that's what you're saying, yes.  Yeah.  It was at one time there were separate departments in each of the county offices and in '97 [1997] all of the departments came under one Department of Human Services, and there was the Department of Aging, Department of, at the time it was called Mental Health, Mental Retardation.  It's now called Behavioral.  Department of Children Youth and Families, Community Services, and--I'm losing it now--Administration, yes.  And I became the, I'm sorry, there was a director, executive director, and the heads of those departments were deputy directors, and I became the head of Children, Youth, and Families, (CYF) and the deputy director.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 176851
Speaker 1: So, you were in that role [Deputy Director of Children, Youth, and Families, Department of Human Services, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania] through-
Speaker 2: Through 2013.
Speaker 1: --2013.  Okay.  (Laughter) so what were some of the, I guess milestones along the way you endured during this period?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that I was able to see during my tenure there, and by the way, I just loved that job.  It was very stressful though, as all child welfare positions are.  But I was able to, it's hard for me to talk about myself but this is what other people have said.  That I was able to open up the relationship between the black community and the system, that other than law enforcement, child welfare might be the only other "system" that is more feared, you know, by the black community and there was a very negative view by the African American community as CYF [Department of Children, Youth, and Families] and was, you know, very much a closed system and I knew that in order to make it better for children, that we had to have some open discussions and some of the players in the helping profession in child welfare had to look the kids we served.  So, you know, I began to advocate and provide contracts to African American grass roots organizations, churches; that was another thing. We didn't use the church.  You can't talk about black folks and not talk about the church in the helping community, and I was very proud to let people know and help the black community understand the workings of child welfare.  What are the laws, the regulations, but more importantly how can you partner with this system that, for decades, was viewed as really denigrating to the black community.  You know, Malcolm X talked about how child welfare he thought was one of the significant systems that just broke up the black family. The other thing, proud, very proud moments was the issue of bringing race to the table.  It was challenging and I took a lot of hits for it, but making sure that you just can't say anything and you also have to consider race and culture in the delivery of service.  Third, I would say opening up and really pushing for kinship care.  That's really what we should be doing.  If we are child protection, we have to protect kids and if we can't keep them in their own home, then put them with their family.  And I don't know, and we really, we were, we are the leaders.  They are still the leaders in kinship care in this county.  But I often wondered if people understand it wasn't just about kinship care, which was so important, but the history of black people in the United States. Child welfare sometime was a modern day way of breaking up families and changing the history of black people, just like slavery.  It's another, it's a history of changing forever the life of that child.  You know, it's beyond just what you do today.  You take this child, remove them from their whole family.  That has an impact for generations to come!  You're not just changing that day, you're changing that forever.  And I've often, I said I'm gonna write about it, often equated many of the practices and policies, power and control, economic survival, and who benefits a lot from child welfare, to that much of our history of slavery in this country.  People don't like to say that 'cause they're well meaning, but we can see a lot of similarities between that, and just being able to say that, people, oh, would get up in arms, but I was proud that I was able to try to have those, you know, have those discussions.  Then, prevention.  You know that being able to bring to the table the fact that no one wants to harm their child.  No one gives birth and says, you know, I think I'm going to be a terrible parent.  I'm going to get on drugs.  I'm going to developmental health issues, I'm going to harm my child--no one does that.  But things happen to people.  So, what can we do to support parents and families and communities so that there are healthier environments so they never have to come to us, never have to come to child welfare.  And, you know, we were able to implement a lot of prevention programs, a lot that were culturally based, really amped up, created, actually, kinship care and amped up our kinship care component, and brought the whole issue of culture and race as important factors in delivery, so it wasn't always an easy ride, and the support and acknowledgments of my hard work outweighed those who criticized it.

Speaker 1: Now the '70s [1970s] were a time when a lot of black professionals organized themselves, National Black Police Association was formed then and the black school educators [National Alliance of Black School Educators] were formed by C.D. Moody [HM Charles D. Moody, Sr.] and other people, but it's also a time when the Association of Black Psychologists was formed and black social workers [National Association of Black Social Workers]-- (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Social workers.
Speaker 1: --Get together, and I think maybe of all the groups, the psychologists and the social workers were probably, have had the most impact.  Maybe people would say that's not true, but I would think they would (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I think so too.
Speaker 1: And so, when did you become involved with them?
Speaker 2: When I first came in to child welfare, like in the '90s [1990s] and, you know, they have a conference every year and, you know, they are such a dynamic group and--
Speaker 1: Now this--we're talking about the National Black Child Development Institute, or the--
Speaker 2: That's a different group.
Speaker 1: That's a different group, okay.  We're talking about the--
Speaker 2: National Association of Black Social Workers [NABSW] and there is also Black Administrators in Child Welfare, two groups.  I look to them for support and rejuvenation because, sometimes when you are, and I was the first, they said, to head child welfare, African American female, as it was structured in this county, but when you are the minority in many ways, black and female, in a predominantly white, male environment, of course it can be, you know, challenging.  I won't say that everything was negative, clearly wouldn't, but sometimes your thinking is so different and I used to sometimes question, well maybe it's, you know, me, 'cause many things that would be up for discussion on this discussion table, I would say, well that doesn't make any sense at all.  Why can't they see that?  But those two groups, I was able to run things by, go to the conference, get rejuvenated, because then there were other people who had the same, you know, values and thought like me.  And they were--we were able to get a lot of policy changes, you know, as a result of that, advocacy.  So those groups are still needed, absolutely.
Story_ID: 176853
Speaker 1: Tell us about the National Black Child Development Institute.  You became the president in 2000-and--
Speaker 2: 2000--when was my baby born.  No, that would have been 19-maybe 2000, no--'98 [1998] maybe.  I can't remember all these dates.
Speaker 1: Okay, well tell us about the organization and what you did as president.
Speaker 2: National Black Child Development Institute is a national organization that advocates for African American children, primarily for educational parity, but also for social conditions that negatively impact the black child, and their affiliates across the country.  Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] is one of them.  Every affiliate has a different focus.  Here in Pittsburgh, we have always focused on literacy and social policy related to the African American child, their voice here to be reckoned with, their voice nationally, and, you know these groups are still necessary.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were the president of the Pittsburgh affiliate.
Speaker 2: The Pittsburgh affiliate; there's a national affiliate that's located in Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do they have a journal?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It's called Black Child Development, and Child Talk.  Yes, you can, there's a website.  They have a quarterly journal, lots of information.  They have a national conference every year, and it brings together social workers, teachers, educators, administrators, interested people to look at what are the current trends in the life of black children, offers help and cutting edge programming for African American children.
Story_ID: 176854
Speaker 1: Now what's the funding been like here in Allegheny County [Pennsylvania] for the issues that have to do with family and children.
Speaker 2: From a child welfare or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just trying to get a sense for--
Speaker 2: Okay.  For public programs, there's state, federal, and local dollars that go into the operation, say for child welfare.  There's primarily, most of it is state tax dollars, with a portion of federal for some programs and, of course, matching tax base here, tax dollars here in the county.  Now, for private a lot of these private organizations depend on the foundation community, philanthropic community, individual donorship, and just sheer hard work and fund raising, generosity.
Speaker 1: Okay, now for the Allegheny County, then the primary source is state money?
Speaker 2: State.
Speaker 1: So, you have to, I guess, have a governor in place, or was that--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  That every year, say for child welfare, there is a budget submitted and it's called a needs-based budget.  They submit a budget and a plan based upon what the forecast is for what did they see as they needs for families in this county and the state, just a very cursory explanation.  The state reviews that and allots so many dollars for the distribution of funds towards child welfare services, whether or not they'd be prevention, intervention, placement services, adoption services, you know, and so on.
Story_ID: 176855
Speaker 1: Now, so you were with the Allegheny [County] Department of Human Services [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] until 2013?  Now I have a note here that the leader of NEED [Negro Educational Emergency Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] who had been there for a long time, Sylvester Pace, passed away in 2012.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was your relationship with NEED?
Speaker 2: Well, not a whole lot other than I had, as a student, an undergraduate student, had been the recipient of NEED grants and I was always appreciative that, you know, they were able to help me finance my college education and, you know, sometimes we would have children from child welfare who had "made it" and we would refer them to NEED for services here.  I worked in my early part of my career with Mr. Pace and considered him, you know, a friend.  He was a great person, a great man, did a lot, a whole lot for kids, and really advocated very strongly that every child should have a chance if they wanted to go to college, and it was quite a blow to this community when he passed away.  They had an interim for a period of time, and then I was approached about assuming the role and I saw it just as an opportunity that I could impact children in a different arena, you know, in another way and I've embraced it.  I really enjoy, you know, working here, what it stands for and having such a good time seeing children just thrive; I mean, having these high expectations for themselves, moving on, going to college, and just doing such wonderful, wonderful work.  It's a good feeling.
Story_ID: 176856
Speaker 1: Now NEED [Negro Educational Emergency Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] was established when you were--
Speaker 2: Seven.  (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, seven years old as the Negro Educational Emergency Drive.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the mission was to--
Speaker 2: Help children go--now it's a very interesting story, because the last year, last October, we celebrated our fiftieth year, our gala, and there was a young woman here by the name of Marion Jordan, and she was a colleague of Medgar Evers and they had worked in an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] together, and when he was assassinated, it had such a profound effect on her that she wanted to be able to continue his dream of helping African American children students go to college, so she met with a young, another influential person here in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], named Florence Reizenstein, and together they rallied to bring business leaders, corporate heads, caring individuals to philanthropic community and they raised money to send seventy-six kids to college that summer, and that started NEED, and since that time we have had over twenty thousand students who have benefited.  We call them NEED alum, from NEED services, and we have given out over twenty-three million dollars in scholarships. And I'm one of those kids that they gave out money to.  It's a misnomer to think that African American students can't get in to college or to, and we know that education is the equalizer, okay, and not that they can't get into, that they clearly qualify and can compete academically, but so many of our students just can't afford to fund it.  You know, parents can't.  It's just the reality, so that's where we come in.  We try to work with parents and their children and the financial aid offices to get the best financial aid package we can get for them, and then that gap.  We call it the last dollar.  That's where we come in and fill in for our students and, you know, we, just to hear the success stories of our students, you know, they call us, "I'm graduating, I'm on the dean's list."  It's just, you know, rewarding.  And most African Americans here in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh, western Pennsylvania, have been NEED recipients.
Story_ID: 176857
Speaker 1: How does NEED [Negro Educational Emergency Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], does NEED like contact the counselors in the various high schools and area or have to work through the counselors?
Speaker 2: Right, yes.  We've moved from just giving out scholarships but we also know that we want to be able to help the average child, because what about the kid who says, well I've never thought about college, or I'm just average.  Well, we want to bring those children up to the standard where they can get admitted to college, so we're in the schools, we're in all of the eight Pittsburgh Public Schools and we're in, right now in four suburban schools and we provide tutorial services, academic enrichment, mentoring, financial aid help, with the parents and filling out all of your FAFSA [Free Application for Federal Student Aid] forms, and so on to get them college ready.  Let's just say it's not just college, 'cause we also are very supportive of secondary education, 'cause everyone, you don't have to go to college.  Of course, we want you to be the best that you can be and get the most that you can, but there are many lucrative careers and positions that require, you know, say a certificate or a two-year degree, or so on but we provide support services as well as scholarship assistance for secondary education.  We have a website, we reach out to the schools.  We have community forums and the churches, civic groups, and we're pretty well known, you know, here as well and people now, with the Internet they do searches and they come to us and that's how we secure our students.
Speaker 1: How is NEED funded?
Speaker 2: Through private donorship.  We do receive some public dollars from the state, but it's primarily through our foundation, we write grants, proposals, those kinds of things, and we have a very generous foundation community that has supported NEED, you know, over the years.  And then, our alum come back and give, fraternities, sororities, churches, individuals will just donate to NEED and that's how we are supported.  So, if you know anyone who would like to support NEED, let us know.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And everything operates out of the downtown offices here [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Well, this is just the administration where we're at today, the administration office, but we're, our work is in the community and in schools.  We have counselors, advisors, and mentors literally in the Pittsburgh Public Schools as well as some of the surrounding schools.  That's where our work is done.
Speaker 1: And is NEED like focused on channeling students to HBCUs [historically black colleges and universities], or--
Speaker 2: Well, we try to get children to see the benefit of going to an HBCU.  You're not required, clearly, but we also clearly want all kids to see that there are other college opportunities outside of Pennsylvania.  Particularly, there is something about this region that Pittsburghers, because it's such a wonderful place to live, tend to stay here and not venture out.  Many of our students, particularly our poorer students, don't have an opportunity to travel outside of the state, so we want to let them see what opportunities there are.  We're delighted, of course, when we have students who go on to HBCUs.  There's something about an HBCU, that is so supportive in a different college experience and for many of our children, you know, that's what they need.  We have a tour every year, an annual HBCU tour and this past year, 2014, the past April, we took seventy-five students over eight days to twelve different universities and historical civil right sites on the eastern coast, and we just had a great time and, you know, when you hear the testimonies of the children when they come back, hey, you know, "I'm going to Morehouse [College, Atlanta, Georgia].  "Lincoln's [Lincoln University, Jefferson City, Missouri] my school."  "I'm going to stay in school.  I've gotta get my grades up, I'm gonna do this 'cuz I wanna go to one of these schools," it's worth all of the effort, and that's all we wanna do is just expose students to what's possible for you and once you see it, you can believe it.
Story_ID: 176858
Speaker 1: Now, what are some of your priority concerns for the African American community today, and what is your top hope?
Speaker 2: My top?
Speaker 1: Hope.
Speaker 2: Hope. Now, this is me, you asked me?  The priority as I see it, and I prioritize it according to what I see is the fundamental problem that affects everything else, and that is cultural alienation.  The further you get, we have gotten away from the culture, and when I say that I'm talking about the basic beliefs, values, tenets of the African American culture that the worse off we are.  When you begin not to like you, yourself, as well as other black people, when you buy into those stereotypes, when you buy into dominant culture's negative view of African Americans, it's, I think it's been the decline.  That's what has resulted in the decline of African Americans.  We've had tougher times, right?  Face it.  We've had tougher times, but what was the difference, say, from the time my parents came along or before.  What made African Americans survive?  What helped them not only survive, but thrive and continue on and move their families forward, and I believe firmly it was that sense that I am, and I don't wanna use [HM] Jesse [L.] Jackson, but I'm somebody.  I come from good stock.  I'm of African descent.  I have a sense of pride.  I'm responsible for other people.  I'm responsible for my fellow African American.  I'm responsible for other peoples' children.  I have a high sense of spirituality, you know that I have to reach out to that inner source of connection with God, Allah, Yahweh, whoever, that, you know, that's a part of me.  Education is important to me.  That I'm not what they see on TV.  That doesn't define me.  I won't let other people define me.  I'll define myself, and I believe that we have lost something in our move towards integration, and I'm not arguing segregation, but the more we moved out of our communities, we moved away towards something that is not necessarily supportive of our culture, that we began to identify and embrace things that don't help our communities.  It doesn't matter the car you drive, the clothes you wear, or identifying with these values, materialism, consumer-ship, I think that was the problem, 'cause when you don't have opportunities for consumer-ship, what do you do?  You'll do whatever you can to get it, okay.  That's just me.  That's what I believe and my hope is that the black community will return, I call it being back to black.  That doesn't mean anti anything else, but embracing black folks, embracing being black, being proud about that, and being true to what our ancestors would have wanted us, you know, to be.
Story_ID: 176859
Speaker 1: Okay, now, when you look back on everything you've done to this point in your career, is there any major thing you'd do differently if you could go back and change the course?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You always get wiser.  I believe I would have, I don't know.  I didn't go to an HBCU [historically black college or university].  I would have done that, I think, very clearly, and sometimes when you're trying to just survive psychologically, 'cause you can't fight every battle, you hold back, not that I held back a whole lot as people would probably attest to, probably would have fought a harder fight, I think.  I think I was probably born ten years later, ten or fifteen years later, you know, too late like I should have been probably coming of age, being at age during the '60s, [1960s], the early '60s [1960s].  Yeah, I don't have too many regrets other than being more, you know, more of a force, and I think because, I don't believe my work is done.
Story_ID: 176860
Speaker 1: Once again when you look back at everything that you've done at this point, and what today would you consider to be your professional legacy?
Speaker 2: That I was a strong and powerful voice for black children.  I think, I don't think anybody could deny that.  That I didn't look for popularity, although I gained a lot of supporters, but I said what I felt needed to be said and did what I felt needed to be done in order to help black kids.  (Unclear) you asked was there anything I didn't do.  My dream, if I never went into this field, I'd be in Hollywood somewhere.  I love the theater and movies and all of that.  So, maybe I could have been an X-men or something, some kind of--(laughter)--
Story_ID: 176861
Speaker 1: Tell us something about your family.  Now, you're married to a Larry [Dean Anderson], you've got a little Larry.
Speaker 2: I've got a little Larry.  Yeah, we have big Larry and little Larry. Larry and I were married, like I said in 1985.  He spent years and years, he was always in athletics.  He was a basketball coach, high school, college professional coach, and travelled quite a bit, and I was in school and, you know, career, working whatever, but we have married now, it'll be twenty-nine years in October and we have two children.  We had children late.  Our first child, Larry Dean Anderson, Jr., he's sixteen now, and the love of my life and our lives, and then we turned around and had Marshall Sturdivant Anderson, who is the other love of our life and of all the things I've done, I know it sounds cliche-ish but that's my biggest accomplishment.  I mean, I produced, along with my husband, I'll give him some credit, I produced two of the finest young people you ever wanted to see.  They're well-mannered, bright, inquisitive, love to learn, they're respectful, and, of others, they're very sensitive of others, and they love black folks.  They love their history, their culture, they are very involved in their culture.  They're very involved in their culture.  They, they're a part of several drumming circles.  They're African djembe and dunun drummers, and are pretty--I think they're pretty good at it, and they're also involved in Civil War reenactment.  They're part of the USC [sic] 6th Regiment [U.S.] Color[ed] Troops.
Speaker 1: USCT [United States Colored Troops]--
Speaker 2: USCT, yes. So they go all over.  They spend a lot of time from that. And when you were talking about Avery, not Avery, William Delaney (ph.)--
Speaker 1: Martin [Robison] Delany.
Speaker 2: Martin Delaney, I'm sorry.  I'm thinking of Avery College [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], all this--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, right, he was associated with that too.
Speaker 2: Right, right, right. It was over there not too far from where you're staying, but, you know they're all into that.  They would have had a long discussion with you about him, and so on.  But they, they're just wonderful, wonderful children and my husband is a wonderful support and a wonderful husband, and it's, you know, and I know I'm blessed to have a strong black male figure, you know, their dad, that we support them.  Education is very important for them, but they have grown.  They're growing into very responsible, you know, black men and we're just very proud, very proud of 'em.
Story_ID: 176862
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I have not asked you that we need to discuss before I ask my last question.
Speaker 2: I can't think of anything.
Speaker 1: Of course the pictures are coming up too.
Speaker 2: Okay-so that would be--okay. No, I can't think of anything. What's-go ahead. (Simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) My last question is similar to legacy but a little bit different:  ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Marcia, a voice for children.
Story_ID: 176863
Speaker 1: This is me, and it was my engagement picture, my announcement, my engagement portrait, that was 1984, and I got married the following year.
Speaker 2: That's me in Fort Lauderdale [Florida], and I brought that because that's another one of my dreams I shared--I just want to live by the water.  I love the water, and there's a seagull in the back there, and for some reason, that seagull just followed me that whole evening, and I said well maybe it's an ancestor come back or something, I don't know, but (laughter).  That's pre-kids, so that's about '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Okay, that is a wedding photo of, of course, my husband [Larry Dean Anderson] and my mother-in-law.  She's since passed, and that was, you know, the '80s, [1980s] where bling and extravagance was a whole part of me.  (Laughter) yeah, it was a good time.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's another version of my engagement with a Dorothy Hamill haircut, very traditional.
Speaker 1: Those are my parents, Mr. and Mrs. O.C. Sturdivant, Jean [Barron Sturdivant] and O.C. Sturdivant.  They were posing outside of the church on my wedding day, and it was a real proud moment for me and for my relatives.
Speaker 2: Now that's me in 1973, maybe '74 [1974], I was a senior.  Yeah, that would have been a senior, just getting ready to graduate.  In fact, I remember that was in the winter, so it would have been right after basketball season, so I was seventeen years old, getting ready to graduate in a few months, West Mifflin North High School [later, West Mifflin High School, West Mifflin, Pennsylvania].  We were the North High Vikings.
Speaker 1: That's me on my graduation from Point Park College [later, Point Park University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] with my mother and my father.
Speaker 2: That's my senior picture from Point Park College, my senior photo from Point Park College.
Speaker 1: Oh, boy, that goes way back.  I was in, I think, the ninth grade.  That's my ninth grade picture and that's my afro that they didn't want me to wear to school, yeah.  That's me about fifteen years old.
Speaker 2: That's my father.  You can see the family resemblance.  My father served on the U.S.S. Intrepid in World War II [WWII], and that's his, one of his [U.S.] Navy photos.
Speaker 1: That was one of the significant moments of my life when I think about, say, the top five where it was just emotionally invigorating, and that was the inauguration of [HM] Barack Obama, and we took, my whole family, we went down.  I took my boys.  They were very young, and they were just so--that's my one baby in the front.  He wouldn't want me to call him a baby now, but that's my oldest child, my sister, and then the little one is my youngest child, and I was just amazed at how children were so excited about, you know, Mr. Obama being elected president, and we just had such a good time.  We were just so happy.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's me when I was at the Urban League of Pittsburgh [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], as the director of early childhood development and that was my school picture.
Speaker 1: Now this is interesting.  This is a picture of my paternal grandmother and my father and my uncle, and O.C. [Sturdivant], Clemmon [Sturdivant] and that's Travis Sturdivant in the back, and I have to admit that there is a family resemblance and when people come over to my house, there is another picture of her that they say that I'm a lot like her, but they say I was like her in stature as well.  Well, my dad was born in 1924, so it looks --
Speaker 2: Oh, well, that's me in high school as a homecoming candidate and my escort and it's interesting, he now has children that are brilliant scholars, so that was that school that we went to where there weren't that many African American students.
Speaker 1: Christmas is a big deal in our house, and this is a picture of my two boys, Larry [Dean Anderson, Jr.] and Marshall [Sturdivant Anderson], and my husband posing.  Every year we do a Christmas photo.
Speaker 2: That's me at one of my many social events, and it's a picture of TiAnda [Blount] and Mel Blount and you know Mel Blount is an NFL [National Football League] Hall of Famer and just a real nice guy, and Mrs. Blount is on the board of NEED [Negro Educational Emergency Drive] and is real instrumental in helping children and certainly a support to me and that was us at one of our affairs, formerly of the Pittsburgh Steelers, yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is me at a children's fair that I used to sponsor every year with the county, and this is a group of students or children from Somalia. They're Somalian refugees and I've done a lot of work with helping those children that a good friend of mine, the director of the Pittsburgh Refugee [& Immigrant Assistance] Center [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania], introduced me to these children and I've embraced them as a part of my family.  That's a pictorial beginning of our trip 'cause I wanted my children to remember.  We were on our way to the first inauguration of Barack Hussein Obama as president of this here United States of America.
Speaker 2: That's me and my mother and this was shortly after my father had passed, and I opened up a new office in child welfare and brought her along and I remember it being very difficult for her during that time, but we posed for the picture and you could see there was also still that I'm a combo baby, the resemblance, but that's my, that's my mommy.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is me and some representatives from the Department of Public Welfare, Pennsylvania [later, Pennsylvania Department of Human Services], where we were at an adoption celebration event P PNC Park [Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania] and PNC Park was, you know, fairly new and we were required to come out of the dugout and from the back, and come up onto the field.
Speaker 2: And I think the next picture is just where my name is on the marquee and I was just overwhelmed and amazed when I ran out and it was such an invigorating experience, it was one of those top five experiences.  My children were very young then and my husband said when they saw my picture up on the megatron they just screamed and screamed, mommy, mommy!  They couldn't imagine what I was doing up there.  (Laughter).
