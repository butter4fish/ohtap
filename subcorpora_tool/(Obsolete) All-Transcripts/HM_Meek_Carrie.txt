Speaker 1: The material I read about Miss Mandy, who's your grandmother--I don't know if--what side of the family was she on?
Speaker 2: She was on my father's side.
Speaker 1: On your father's side.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Could we talk about your father and give you--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: If you could give us his name and what you know about--,
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.
Speaker 1: --his background?
Speaker 2: My father's name was Willie Pittman.  He was born and raised in Georgia. There is very little evidence of the city where my father was born.  Because during those days, there was quite a bit of conflict where he was and he had to leave, where he was living.  And he moved to another place called Lilly, Georgia.  And my father was--my father's mother, Miss Mandy, was the one who was a slave.  But his grandfather was a slave as well and that's the one that I know most about.  My father's father, who was a slave, and so was my father's mother.  They were both slaves.  But there's more evidence of my father's father.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us what you know?
Speaker 2: What I know I received from my oldest sister, Evelyn.  My mother used to keep a lot of information in the Bible, as a lot of African American families do.  And what we knew was that he worked for years as a slave and he was just a very--I would call a very militaristic, a very aggressive person, who didn't like to be a slave.  And as a result of it, several times he tried to escape but was always captured.  But he was one that worked in the fields, and was strong in the fields.  And that's the thing that my oldest sister talked about all the time.  That he was such a strong--pick up cotton and the other vegetables. He wasn't one that was--he was resilient is what--very strong and very strong character and a great church person, as much as they could have during those days.  Not educated at all, as no slaves were at that time.  So that's the background.  It all came from my oldest sister Evelyn.  She told us about all of these people.  And how my mother [Carrie Pittman] was--married my father in Lilly, Georgia.  And that he had to run from where he was born, where his father was.  And there's very little--it's sketchy information on them.  All I know is what was passed on me orally--passed onto me orally by my sister Evelyn.
Speaker 1: Now you said your father was from a, a, town at the beginning. And there's no record.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] No record.
Speaker 1: Do you know the name of that town?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.  But I know he had to leave it.  He had to leave that town and he fled to Lilly, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Did your father share with you any stories about growing up in Lilly, Georgia that you know?  Or was there not much talk of that?
Speaker 2: Not very much.  But he used to say how hard he worked. You know and that he was a farmer.  And he was brought up picking cotton, shaking peanuts, and doing the things that those kind of farm workers do.  But he never talked so much about it.  He had just about a fifth grade education and he was very smart.  And when he read, he didn't read like you and I would read by watching the page.  You could hear him whisper [imitates whisper] "pssst, pssst," like that, as he read.  It appears as if he were reading aloud to himself because he was never taught to read.  But he could read the paper and he would add, and subtract and do quite a few things that you wouldn't think people could do who didn't have very much education.
Story_ID: 18721
Speaker 1: Now your mother, her name?
Speaker 2: Carrie Tanzie Pittman.  Yes.
Speaker 1: So you're Carrie Jr.?
Speaker 2: Yes [laughs].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what do you know abut her background?
Speaker 2: She was educated.  My mother went to the twelfth grade, which was sort of unusual during those days.  And just before I came, I looked in one of my photograph books and I saw a picture of my mother with her sisters and she had about twelve in her family. And she bore twelve children.  But she was quite different from my father's background. Her background, having grown up in Lilly, Georgia, not to far from a place called Montezuma now.  Her relatives now live in a little place called Montezuma, Georgia.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to the family reunion over there.  And she was a schoolteacher.  And what we would call a very, very literate person.  She read the Bible a lot.  She taught me poems. She taught us all about life. And her philosophy of life was, "If one works hard and honors God, you would get to achieve."  She really, really believed in hard work.  And she was a woman who had sort of gnarled hands as I remember.  We call them Carrie Pittman hands. I have the same hands.  Same gnarled looking hands.  I've had them since I was a girl. My son [Kendrick Meek] has them. So it must be sort of a hereditary thing. But my mother had them because she was such a hard worker.  And sometimes I'm very passionate when I bring up about my mother. So you have to bear.
Speaker 1: She had a great influence on you?
Speaker 2: She washed and ironed.  She--we went to school because we were very poor.  There were twelve of us.  And my father [Willie Pittman] had come away from the farm.  He was a sharecropper.  So he moved away from the farm where he was sharecropping.  So then when they moved to town, my mother had to wash and iron.  (Pause)  She worked in the white people's kitchen.  She did whatever she could do to--and she took in laundry, from white people because there really wasn't a way a woman of her intelligence could make it during that time because what she would do is she would go and--because they didn't have laundries then, she would go and get bundles of clothes from the white families and she would wash them outside in a big old tub.  A big old black tub.  And she had what was called a balance stick.  Wherein she would, up and down, up and down like this 'til the clothes got clean and boiled. And she would wash them until they were just as white as snow.  And there was no Clorox during those days.  And I think that helped our hands get gnarled. Because she could put them in the hottest of water to do what she had to do.  So she was really a worker, my mother was.  But she washed and ironed and she was a maid for many, many years.  And she used to bring food home for us, clothes home for us. I remember this.  [Pause]  I remember my mother very well.  How hard she--and how she wanted us to be educated.  Because during those days, you didn't really--you could've drop out of school.  You could drop out of school if you wanted to.  You didn't have to keep going, but my mother was so strong in that she said that each one of you is gonna get an education.  And the boys didn't seem to want it because they weren't used to some of the unequal things.  They didn't have clothes and they were from the farm and everything.  So they kind of stood out. And they didn't wanna go. But the girls stayed in school and worked.  I was the only one that didn't work very hard, physically because I was the youngest of twelve.  So I stayed home and I was the pet and I was able to study harder than the rest of them.  And I loved books.  I always had a love of books because it came from my mother, 'cause she could read and write so well.  So she was a--my mother was a matriarch really.  Because she was head of that family along with my father.  They were together for about fifty years.  And never once--it was a very loving family.  And I was brought in--brought up in the great outdoors.  That's why I now have such a great love for the outdoors because there was really nothing indoors to see.  So we played outdoors a lot.  We ran and we gathered plums.  We picked blackberries.  We chased through the woods and everyplace and I got to be quite a little tomboy during those days because my mother would let me work that morning.  The rest of them had to work all day long.  And then in the afternoon, I'd have a chance to play.  But to begin to kind of sum my mother up, she was a caretaker and she was a caregiver.  And she kept all those twelve children while my father struggled as a sharecropper.  And when he'd come home in the afternoon, she'd have his food on the table and everything.  Even though she had been, you know, to the kitchen, to everyone's kitchen, everyone's backyard doing whatever she could for the people for whom she worked.  Because she got little tidbits at each home where she could get work.  So what--she was a strong Christian,  very strong.  And she taught us that kind of discipline.  And I never did fear working because of my mother. And I never feared anyone.  She taught us to not be afraid and to not be jealous of other people.  Not be jealous of things that other people had, even though we didn't have it.  She was really something.  But my father was sort of a comedian. He was very, very funny.  And everyone in the neighborhood knew him as Willie Pittman and they called him 'Papa Pitt.'  And Papa Pitt was a very jovial person, my father was.  And he kept everyone laughin'.  And he didn't too much complain about his plight.  And it was not a good one, to tell you the truth. It was not a good one.  Because we had a very hard time.  But we didn't even know we was poor as we were.  Because we always had some sort of food on the table.  Because my father's background as a farmer and my mother's background as a caregiver.  She knew how to make something out of nothing.  She'd make a big pan of grits and a big pan of biscuits.  And we'd put a little syrup, you know, with the biscuits. And as I recall, we didn't have any meat.  But she had those biscuits cooked in such a way that you'd take them and sop the syrup and you were just as happy as you could be.  And then we just loved each other.  The twelve of us loved each other. And that came from my mother and father.  And she used to say, "No matter how tough it is, you know, you can make it."  And that's how we grew up that way.  And then I get--I was the only one that got a chance to run off and read.  The rest of them were working the entire time.
Speaker 1: You know, it's amazing when you hear your story and others you think about the black community and how support--I mean there was, there's a lot of warmth that comes out--,
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: --of what you're telling me--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --right now.  And out of the, well anyway.
Speaker 2: And the neighbors--when my mother--when anyone of us veered away or didn't do the right thing, people like Sing Long, who was a--a down the street neighbor, she watched and she would come up and make us correct our behavior. And we knew to do what Sing Long said because my mother would give us a second whipping if we didn't do what Sing Long said.  So that was this kind of community in the black community, that they took care of each other.
Story_ID: 18722
Speaker 1: Give me your sibling's names, starting with the oldest and coming down to you.
Speaker 2: Okay.  There was Zellabee, we call her Zela. But she was the oldest one. There were six girls and six boys.  And then there was one that--there was one that I didn't know because she died before I was born.  But her name was Estelle.  Estelle was really the oldest. And then there was Zellabee.  And then there was 'Sister.'  Each one of us had a nickname.  My sister's real name was Evelyn.  But they called her Sister.  And then there was Elijah.  And there was Walker.  And there was 'Tit.' They all--Tit's name was--no.  Tit's name--I can't even remember Tit's real name.  They all had these nicknames.  And then there was 'Man' whose name was Samuel.  That's getting closer to me.  I'm the youngest.  And then there was 'Hook' whose really name was King George.  And then there was 'Presh,' whose name was Precious Louise, and then there was 'Tot.'  I'm Tot.  Carrie 'Tot' Pittman.
Speaker 1: And you had a twin, right?  That died--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in childbirth.
Speaker 2: Yes. In childbirth. And my mother said, that he was the sturdiest of the two.  And he was the one that they would expect to live. But I was very, very small.  And she said, "You had to put me on a pillow."  She used to talk about it. And you could barely hold me unless I was on that pillow.  And my Dad [Willie Pittman]--my--we didn't have doctors during that day.  Has a (unclear)--the midwife's name was Sister Rhet (ph.).  I remember--I don't remember her but my mother used to talk about Sister Rhet.  She was the midwife that came around.  But because she had twins with me, she called in Doctor Campbell, who lived over in Frenchtown, who was considered then sort of the middle or upper class person.  So Doctor Campbell came because my mother had twins.  And he was a big doctor in Tallahassee [Florida] there.  But I was the only one, that after I was born, there was a doctor, Doctor Campbell, 'cause Sister Rhet was the midwife that brought us all into the world.

Speaker 1: How did your parents--since they met in Lilly, Georgia, how did they end up in Tallahassee [Florida]?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: You don't know?
Speaker 2: I don't know how they got to Tallahassee. Except he probably followed the people that he got work with there.  'Cause he was a sharecropper.  You know, how they travel from place to place. And I'm--I have a feeling that's how they got to Florida.
Story_ID: 18724
Speaker 1: What are some of your earliest memories of growing up?  Do you--I was just wondering if you could share some of them?
Speaker 2: Well some of my earliest memories of growing up were the fact that I was in Sunday school every Sunday.  And after Sunday school, we went to what is called BYPU [Baptist Young Peoples Union], that's the Baptist Training Union.  And then after that church--church was our real life during that time.  But as I said, I was one that was able to stay outdoors and play a lot.  I read a lot.  I was the one.  Being the youngest one, and living in Tallahassee [Florida], where Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] was, a college at that time, I was able to go to the library every once in a while.  It was called the Carnegie Library.  And I was able from first grade on--I remember my teacher, her name was Lilly Mae White.  And she saw in me something.  Because she sort of--she saw that I loved reading and she sort of favored me to some extent.  She'd take me home with her during the summer and read books to me and teach me.  And I got to be quite a student because of Lilly Mae White in the first grade. And my mother [Carrie Pittman] encouraged me to do all these kinds of things because the other eleven didn't get that opportunity.  So Miss Lilly Mae White who was at that time--well at first--let me back up a little bit.  I used to walk about five miles every day to school with my older sisters.  Because they didn't get a chance to go to the lab school at Florida A&M like I did. They had to go to a school called Griffin College.  They called it a college because it went from first grade all the way up to twelfth grade.  So they call it a college.  It was in Springfield [Florida].  That's over town in Tallahassee.  So I'd walk with them every morning as small as I was.  I wasn't even six years old.  But we walked that far.  And when we got to school, we had to chew out pencils.  They didn't have pencil sharpeners.  They didn't have books.  The books they had were books just--books that had been cast aside.  The school district did not provide any new books for the black children.  So the only books I saw that were new and had something that would be attractive, was at the Carnegie Library.  Having--my having the chance to go to the laboratory school, that was set up by Florida A&M. And I got the chance that most of my siblings did not get.  But I had a real good childhood.  I ran and played a lot, stayed outdoors a lot.  And was very, very athletic, from a little kid all the way up.  We used to--try to swim in Camel Lake.  I don't know how we--I don't know how I got by doing these things, when at the time I couldn't swim at all.  But I used to jump in the lake, and then some sort of way dog paddle to a boat or to the wharf or someplace.  So I did have a great outdoor background.  And a great background in reading.  And to this very day, I love literature.  I loved reading because of my background.  And I think it came from my mother. She spawned it and then when I went to Florida's A&M's laboratory school, they really, really worked with me.  Because during those days there were some middle class young black kids during those days.  I wasn't one of them, but there were some during that time.
Story_ID: 18725
Speaker 1: Can you talk a little bit about Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] lab school? 'Cause I mean I think of lab school--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It's called Lucy Moten.  The laboratory school was a school that was set up to train the teachers.  See, there were young--people going to Florida A&M to get a degree. Because during those days, almost all black people went into teaching--some phase of education or in medicine, one or the other. But most of them were in education.  So those people who went to Florida A&M to get an education degree, well they had to go some place to practice.  And they called it practice teaching.  And the practice teaching was at Lucy Moten Training School [sic, Lucy Moten Elementary School, now the Developmental Research School].  That's what it was called.  Lucy Moten Training School.  Lucy Moten was a laboratory school for Florida A&M's high school.  That's what it is.
Speaker 1: So that's where you went to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to elementary there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I started in first grade there.  The building still exists.  And I went on to the sixth grade.  After that I went to seventh grade at Florida A&M and they had it in the science lab on the university's campus.  That's what was dedicated for--there weren't but seven people in my high school graduating class from Florida's A&M's laboratory school, and their high school.  Two years of that time after--when I got to ninth grade, they closed Florida A&M's lab school.  And because of shortage of funds they said. But, of course, they still had the other lab school at the university, at Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida].  But they closed the ones for black kids.  So then we went to the--these, quote, unquote public school which was Lincoln High School, which was about six miles from where I lived.  There was no transportation.  You had to walk.  I went to Lincoln High School [Tallahassee, Florida] in ninth and tenth grade.  Then for some reason or another, they decided to open the lab school at Florida A&M.  I was so happy. And let me tell you why.  I got a chance to be taught by college teachers when I was in high school.  I was--I had a chance to be taught the literature of all of the African American writers.  I knew them all.  Countee Cullen was someone.  I knew all of Langston Hughes' poems.  And I knew them.  And it was just--I was just familiar with the black experience which my sisters and brothers did not get a chance to do.  Paul Laurence Dunbar.  I remember the first poem I learned was, 'Little brown baby with the sparkling eyes, come to your pappy and sit on his knee.'  And all those kinds of wonderful poems I learned because I was there.  And I had teachers who were teaching college students.  And I had science teachers who were teaching college students.  Mr. Carlow (ph.) who was teaching math at that time.  Mr. Tinner, Doctor Tinner, who was teaching physics, was teaching us in high school.  So I had a leg up by having gone to the lab school at Florida A&M--it wasn't a university then.
Speaker 1: How did your--,
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] It was just a college.
Speaker 1: --how did your mother [Carrie Pittman]--I mean how did you find out about the lab school?  Was that--.
Speaker 2: Well, we moved--we were within one block of Florida A&M.  My father [Willie Pittman], at the time, when he left the sharecroppers job, he moved to a place--they call it 'down in the bottom.'  But it was Carroll's Quarters.  He started working for a man by the name of Fred Carroll. And Fred Carroll owned these quarters.  And these quarters were near Florida A&M, luckily.  And we stayed there for quite a few years in Carroll's Quarters.  And then my father was by then taken up rent for Mr. Carroll who was a real land bearer in the black community.  He had all kinds of housing.  So my father, who was sort of like the caretaker by then, of Mr. Carroll's properties, that were pretty much in the quarters, he was able to move up the hill from Carroll's Quarters. And we were across the street from Lucy Moten.  From the lab school.  We were right there on Bruno Street.  Not Bruno--Boulevard Street, which is across the street from Lucy Moten.  And we lived there. And that's how I was able just to cross the street to go to school. When my sisters and brothers had to walk six or seven miles as first graders to get to school.  So times were beginning to change by then.  Not very much in terms of civil rights because everything was separate and unequal during those days.
Story_ID: 18726
Speaker 1: You've talked about your mother [Carrie Pittman] and father [Willie Pittman],  who would you say--we take things from both our parents.  But--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Would you say--who do you say you're like most? Or what do you take from each parent?  And, you know, what is that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I think I'm more like my mother.  I think that I take my caring kind of feelings, and I care a lot about other people. And I always wanna sort of be a nurturer. I think I took that from my mother.  And also my quest for learning I took from her as well.  But my comedic side is from my father.  I always have something funny to say . And I have a great sense of humor that came from my father.  But I'm more like her I'm aggressive and I want to accomplish things.  She was the same way. I remember when I first started teaching at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]. That was after I'd taught for ten years at Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida], and they were marching.  We were marching during those days, during the sit-ins.  And we were marching down--we were going--on our way downtown, at the time. And Reverend C. K. Seal was kind of leading things.  A guy by the name of James Eton was involved in it.  And we were going with the students.  At that time, I was no longer a student.  I had graduated and I was back at Florida A&M for that summer.  And the marchers came by my mother's house.  And she said, "I really wanna go."  During that time, she wasn't able to walk that well.  She said, "I really wanna go."  She was very militant.  Even during those days. And she always knew what the struggle was all about. She understood the struggle and she encouraged us to participate in it.  But she didn't encourage us to do things that would've hurt us.  In that, she would discourage us from walking on the same side of the street downtown as the white people.  She would say to you, "Don't go over there" she said, "because they'll cause you trouble."  And she wouldn't let my brothers even go downtown because she knew what a terrible place it was.  And there was no place you could go to the bathroom.  There was--you couldn't try on a hat.  You couldn't try on shoes.  And she warned us.  She kept us sort of, I guess, fortified against it.  But yet we were just teaming with rage, because of what was going on during those times.  And--but she was a very protective mother.  She knew how to keep her sons out of trouble.  With the girls, she was a little more lenient on us.  And we were able to do some things.  But not the boys.
Story_ID: 18727
Speaker 1: What type of young person were you?  Were you, you know, serious, were you mischievous? Were you, you know.  Did you laugh a lot?  You know, I mean what kind of young person were you?
Speaker 2: I was a very happy young person.  I was very mischievous.  I used to do everything I could to trick my father [Willie Pittman]. And I had a popgun that he had made for me yet I would go around the corner and shoot at him with the popgun, with the popgun.  I used to climb the chinaberry trees to get the stuff you put in the popgun.  And I was very, very athletic.  I could do almost anything as I told you during my childhood.  But I was also serious but only about school.  I was serious about school,  I loved school.  And my mother used to say, "Go and get her.  She's running to go now."  While I was down in Carroll's Quarters [Florida]. And they hadn't combed my hair.  They hadn't done anything.  But I would run and try to get up to Lucy Moten [Elementary School, now the Developmental Research School at Florida A&M University] because I loved school so much.  I loved reading so very much.  And I was also very dramatic.  I was in--tried to be in all the plays they had.  But I never ended up being Snow White. I just tried so hard to be Snow White but they always chose a girl that was fair skinned with big braids down her hair.  And then when they had the 'Pied Piper of Hamlin,' I wanted to be the heroine in that. I ended up being a rat.  But I went through all of those stages and [laughs] I enjoyed it so much.  I remember very well when we did the Pied Piper.  Instead of my being the heroine who had the lead song, it was saying, "Here come the rats, the rats, the rats."  And I was in my little rat uniform with a long tail. But it was a lot of fun.  And I enjoyed school so much.  And I used to enter what they call--they call 'em declaratory contests. But they were really contests where you debated and where you were able to recite poetry, usually poetry by some black author.  But I was really what you would call a child in a gifted program, because I was at the university.  And that I heard W.E.B. Dubois speak when other people couldn't.  I saw George Washington Carver.  He came there and he gave all kind of exhibits.  I heard Roland Hayes sing, Marian Anderson sing, Mrs. Gainer sing.  I heard them all.  It's amazing what I was able to get being there at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] as a little one.  From first grade on through sixth grade.  So the things that a youngster would have to be a part of a privileged family to hear, I was able to hear and to see.  And to be able to--to be able to really relate to the great black experience.
Speaker 1: Why do you think you liked reading so much?  What do you think appealed to you?
Speaker 2: I think because it was vicarious that I could go places and I could learn about things.  And I was just a smart kid.  I was the one they called the smart kid.  It's--, "She's the only Pittman that's smart." That was not a very good compliment [laughs].  But that's what they used to say to my mother [Carrie Pittman].  And I'd say, "Well, why would she--."  But I was the only one who had the exposure to all of this. And that was why.  But I think I liked reading because it took me places.  It took me out of Carroll's Quarters, you  know.  It took me to the broad spaces.  I knew about [Geoffrey] Chaucer--every piece of literature that you could think of.  And I knew all about how other people live because I could read. And I liked geography during those days as well.  I think that's why I liked reading so much.  Because it did change my whole environment.

Speaker 1: What did you wanna be when you were young?  Did you have dreams--?
Speaker 2: I had several career changes in my mind.  I started out wanting to be a dog doctor.  I wanted to be a veterinarian because I loved animals and I wanted to be that.  And then after that I wanted to go--I wanted to be a doctor.  But then when I found out how expensive it was to be a doctor--and my parents didn't have any money. They could not send me to medical school even though I was very good in the biological sciences.  Well they couldn't afford to do that. So I settled to become a teacher because I loved my physical education teachers so much.  And they were so good. And they wore white uniforms with a little handkerchief in their pockets.  And they were very good.  They were good in tennis.  They were good in basketball, volleyball, sports.  I had some of the best teachers and coaches you could imagine, so I related to them.  And that's why I ended up being a physical education teacher.  But first, the reason why I wanted to be a doctor, I fell in love with my biology teacher.  His name was Doctor Robert Bragg.  And I wanted to learn everything that Dr. Bragg knew.  And he was very smart.  And that was my love affair with being a doctor.  And then when I found out that I couldn't be one, then I had to go--I don't think it was--I didn't condescend to become a physical education teacher.  Because in between the doctor and physical education was history.  But history didn't stay with me very long.  And I, really wanted to be--I wanted to be an athletic teacher because I was very good in athletics.  I played basketball,  I played volleyball.  I ran track I could do it all.  So I said well the best why for me to reach my life's career is to be a physical education teacher.  And I've never regretted it.  It taught me so very much about life and competition and how one gets up when one falls.  Or how one is not afraid of losing as long as they're putting forth their very best.  I think my training and background in athletics, learning how to take a blow and get up, is what made me advance in politics to this day.  I really do.
Story_ID: 18729
Speaker 1: Now you had mentioned one other--before we go, you had mentioned one other teacher that you said--but I think it was--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] T. R. Lang, Theresa Lang, right.  She taught me from seventh grade through twelfth grade.  And she taught me English and she taught me English literature.  And she carried us throughout English literature as well as American literature.  And she was outstanding.  She was the kind of teacher you very rarely see.  She was very hard on us.  We were deathly afraid of Mrs. Lang.  But she was that kind of a teacher who had, obviously had a very good background of her own. You see.  And those teachers took a lot of time with us.  Remember, my graduating class, there weren't but seven.  Seven.  And most of those other kids were teacher's children.  I was the only little one that didn't have anyone professional at that time in my background.  My sister was teaching at a little country school out from Tallahassee [Florida].  But these other youngsters in my class, their fathers and mothers were university teachers at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College, Tallahassee, Florida], because it was not a university.  At that time it was a college, but I went to school with Mr. Marshall's son.  I went to school with Leticia Ford whose sister was administrator at the university.  I went to school with Mary Nasbee whose father was head of the art department.  And they were all in my seventh grade class.  I went to school with Edward Colla whose father was head of the math department.  I was the only one out of Carroll's Quarters [Florida] in that group, that seven.
Speaker 1: Great exposure.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Story_ID: 18730
Speaker 1: I wanna know what Tallahassee [Florida] was like back then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know, as opposed to what it was today.  The second question, is sort of tangential is, you know, you hear a lot about the Deep South and black people.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, you hear some about the North. You don't really know a lot about Florida, you know. I mean other--lots of people don't know about Florida blacks.  You know, you hear a lot about Hispanics.  I'm talking about today.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Right.  You're right.
Speaker 1: So my question is, what was that community of people sort of like?  And what was Tallahassee like then?
Speaker 2: Tallahassee, was, in my opinion, one of the most racist cities you could ever live in. From my early beginning.  And when I say racist, I mean two societies,  one black and one white.  And, of course, blacks were not treated well in Tallahassee.  We couldn't ride the buses at first.  Then when we were able to ride, we had to sit in the back of the bus.  We would--we could not go downtown and try on anything--hat, shoes, dress. You could buy something.  You couldn't go in the front door of even the bus station. You had to go in the back door. You had to go in the back door of anyplace that you went to in Tallahassee.  It was very demoralizing.  Not to the older people. My mother [Carrie Pittman] knows.  We're used to this.  I mean, but the rest of us didn't like it at all.  You couldn't go downtown and sit at a lunch counter.  And we were just treated unfairly.  You, your schools were poorly equipped.  And I keep saying to you that if I had not gone to the Lucy Moten [Elementary School, now the Developmental Research School at Florida A&M University, Tallahassee, Florida], I think my education would have been stifled because the schools were so different.  In terms of the services that they were able to render to the students there because of the double standard.  Now there were some very good teachers at Lincoln High School [Tallahassee, Florida].  Very good.  But they didn't have the best of equipment.  They didn't have the best--students didn't have the best books.  And, of course, the other thing that I saw that was so different there, you couldn't get a job unless you worked in someone's kitchen or you washed and ironed.  And Florida State University [Tallahassee, Florida] at that time was called Florida State College for Women.  I couldn't go there being a black woman.  I could not go to Florida State College for Woman.  Yet that was the state school that was in my hometown of Tallahassee.  And I wanted to go over there and take some courses related, because they had a dance department at that time.  Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] did not have it. But we couldn't go over there and take anything at all.  So there was this divided, segregated place.  And there were stories of lynchings around Tallahassee.  Particularly in cities like Perry and Monticello, and those places surrounding Tallahassee.  And particularly, black men had a very, very hard time in Tallahassee.
Speaker 1: (Off-camera discussion)
Speaker 2: Now let me ask--so you're saying basically Tallahassee was no different than the Deep South?
Speaker 1: It is the Deep South.  It's south Alabama.  It's right there near Alabama and Georgia.  Thomasville, Georgia is just thirty some miles from Tallahassee.  So to see the environment there--you just didn't get fair treatment there.  It was the seat of--it was the capital.  Yet we didn't--we were not welcome in that capital in Tallahassee.  Only when the governor took his seat.  That's what my father [Willie Pittman] called it.  But it really was an inauguration of the governor every four years.  That's when we were welcomed downtown.  Now having gone to Tallahassee--to Florida A&M now, there was another dimension in that many of the white politicians would come to the university, you know.  And I remember as a third grader, marching from the library, Carnegie Library, down the little hill. Marching into the auditorium so we could go in there and sing because the legislator was coming to the university.  That's when we got to see them.  When they came out to the university or when the governor took his seat, the inauguration.  We were not welcome. And I know we weren't welcome.  I remember it very, very well.  Yes.
Speaker 2: Now when it was time--and were there other things that you did in high school or things that were sort of forming you as a person?
Speaker 1: Excuse me.  Another thing.  We couldn't go to the pools.  When we--I did get big enough to want to try and learn how to swim or to try to swim in a pool.  We couldn't go.  Guess what?  They closed the pool to keep us from going.  And I think most pools are closed to this day.  Most of them out in golf links are still closed to this day because of what happened back then. There was separate--when we finally got pools, they were separate.  And we could dare not stick our toe in any pools that the whites swam in.  So they made some little pools over on the other side of town.  And it was because of the university now, that we got some--a few things.  There was a place there called College Pond that belonged to the university. A little murky pond, but it was the only thing that was there.  And Boy Scout Lake was there and they took that from us and gave it to Florida State University.  I guess you think from my speech that--or I'm--I have rage in me.  I do from those days because we were cheated.  We were cheated out of a lot.  We were cheated out of a strong educational program.  When I got ready to go to grad school I went to Florida A&M University.  Had a very good education, very good. The teachers cared about us.  They took time with us.  And as a result of it, most of them who came along during those days were not exposed to as much as we would have been exposed to, had we gone to a state university that wasn't all black.  And when I got ready, after I got my bachelor's degree, to go and get a master's degree, I couldn't go to any university in Florida.  Not one.  And that was by state statute.  It wasn't because someone said you couldn't go.  It was codified in the laws of Florida that no blacks would be allowed to any state university. So as a result of it, they gave me--I remember it just as if it were yesterday, a $150 scholarship that--they called it a scholarship. And that was to pay my tuition at any school outside of the state of Florida.  They didn't care where you went.  As long as you got out of Florida or out of the South.
Story_ID: 18731
Speaker 1: I had a very good teacher by the name of Laura Botley who went to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], I wanted to go to the University of Michigan.  So I was accepted there. And I had my $150 that I was to pay my tuition.  And they gave me a train ticket to Ann Arbor, Michigan.  And I remember that as if it were yesterday.  Because I knew that that's the only place--I mean I had to get out of Tallahassee [Florida].  I had to get out of Florida.  So I remember getting on the train in a little derby hat.  And I had a little box of chicken and some sweet potatoes in that box of chicken.  And with that, I rode to the University of Michigan.  And I'm so glad, to this day, that I got that opportunity.  But I'm hurt because I didn't get a chance--and so many like me.  There was another guy by the name of Virgil Hawkins.  And some day I hope you'll be able to find out about Virgil Hawkins who tried so hard to break into the law school at the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida].  And for decades they kept him out. Decades.  And just this past week, the president of the University of Florida visited me here in this office, and said they gave Virgil Hawkins a degree posthumously.  So I thought to myself what hath God wrought that the president would have to come here to me to say that about Virgil Hawkins?  We fought so hard for Virgil.
Speaker 2: Now did you--so there was no question about you going to college then?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No question at all?
Speaker 1: No.  I was the first one that wanted to go.  And I was the youngest.  My sisters and all stopped after they got like a one-year degree.  Or, you know, after they finished high school and started teaching because we needed--they were all helping out.  They're the reasons why I was able to make it.  My sister Evelyn at twelfth grade started teaching at a little school over in Monticello [Florida]. Out in the country, and at another little country school called Miccosukee.  When she taught all the grades, she'd say, "Come up first grade." First grade would come up. "Come up second grade."  All of these were taught in a little church and my sister Evelyn did it.  And she did that so she could help me go to school. 'Cause my parents couldn't make very much during that time.  She helped us.  And then my sister Louise when she got out, she didn't go to college.  She worked a while, then she got married.  And she went to school--went to college for one year.  I was the first one to graduate from college.  And none of the boys went.  They left.  They was so angry that they left.  Most of them went to the service.  And then one of them left and--well my oldest sister left and went to New York.  And she was a domestic for many years.  That was Della. Yes, Zellabee.
Story_ID: 18732
Speaker 1: When you get to Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], what is that experience like? You--is it just a continuation since you were familiar? I mean--.
Speaker 2: When I went there to work?
Speaker 1: No.  To--.
Speaker 2: When I went to school there?
Speaker 1: To school, yeah.
Speaker 2: Well it was an opportunity.  Florida A&M was an opportunity.  It's the only place--it wasn't the only place, 'cause I could've gone to some other black colleges. But my parents were not able. And I wanted to go to Florida A&M.  There's something about that school that is sort of contagious.  Once you've been around it, you wanna be around it.  That's so--pretty much with all the graduates.  It's hard to find a disgruntled graduate of Florida A&M.  And it was the state, quote, unquote "separate but unequal" college.  And we loved it.  And when I went there, I worked hard as I always did.  I met a lot of people.  I met a lot of people who went everywhere and made very good lives.  So Florida A&M was separate, it was unequal.  But there was such a great effort by the administration and the teachers.  I remember Dr. Lee who was the president at first of Florida A&M.  He used to let me go to Lucy Moten [Elementary School, now the Developmental Research School at Florida A&M University] when they had a little tuition but my father couldn't pay.  So he'd come down there and my father would give him eggs.  I remember Doctor Lee. He had a big horse.  He rode all the way down in the bottom in Carroll's Quarters [Florida] to see my father.  And so my father said, "I don't have the money for those children."  So he would let us go to Lucy Moten.  And that's how we did it.  But Florida A&M is really, in my opinion, it's sort of like a beacon of light in my life.  It really was.  Because it added so much as a child.  It added a lot when I got to high school.  It added a--even more when I got to college.
Speaker 1: Were there people there who influenced you [unclear]--?
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Definitely so.
Speaker 1: Who were they?
Speaker 2: Definitely so.  First of all, Doctor Gray, William H. Gray whose father--whose son is now over the United Negro College Fund.  I was his babysitter.  And by the way, he was a bad little boy.  And to this day I remind him of that [laughs].  But Doctor Gray was president of Florida A&M when I was a student.  There were other good presidents.  But he was one that sort of like reached out and made--pushed the state a little bit harder to make things a little more equal there.  Doctor Lee had been great.  They've all--they've had all great presidents there.  But naturally, I remember Doctor Gray so because he was such a striver.  And he was one that made the Florida legislature do a little bit more for Florida A&M.  He was the president.  And, of course, I mentioned to you Mrs. T. R. Lang. And also Bertha Miner.  We called her 'Babe' Miner.  She was my coach and my teacher and my mentor.  She was a lady who was perfect in every way, we thought because she was good.  She was a northerner.  She came to Florida to teach at Florida A&M.  And she taught us more about life, I think, than anything else along with her sports ability because we could emulate Bertha Miner.  We called her 'Babe.' Because she was outstanding in athletics.  She was an academic, which I really, really wanted to be and strived to be.  And she was just all around.  She excelled in every sport, as well as being a historian as well.  And then there was--Mr. [Alonzo] Jake Gaither, who was the coach at that time.  We all worshiped Jake Gaither, A. S. J. Gaither. He's known throughout this country for having had more teams to win honors--athletic honors.  He too was a very scholarly man. I remember, he taught me a lot about Grecian and Roman history.  And how he used to relate how the Grecians and the Roman people were constantly striving for excellence.  Not only in education, but in the arts.  He knew black history very well, Coach Gaither did.  And then I had literature teachers like Mrs. T. R. Lang. and my good psychology teachers like the Mann sisters,  economics, Mr. Kidd,  math, Mr. Cuyler.  I just remember all those people vividly because they were so good.  And they worked so hard to make us understand and to make us want to learn. It was all about being a serious student for me.  Yet I enjoyed it.  I was an athlete.  I played basketball.  And all the boys I liked didn't like me. So I had to choose the others.  I got the leavings I think [laughs] during those days.  But I wasn't into boys so much.  I was into athletics and my books.  I didn't get into boys 'til I--I was into them, but they were not into me at that time [laughs].  It wasn't until I graduated and went out to teach at Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida] that I looked around. I said, "Boy, there's some men here who, you know, are doing something with their lives."  FAMU [Florida A&M] was a great place.  Great place.  But everybody looked at me says--they called me 'Tot.'  They wanna meet my girlfriends.  They said, "Tot, go and tell Tish I wanna see her."  I said, "What about me?"  So that's what happened [laughs] at FAMU to me.  I had a wonderful college life.  Just wonderful.  We traveled with the basketball team.  I went to other colleges,  historically black colleges.  I went to Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  I ran in the Tuskegee relays.  In the Alabama State Relays.  I ran against Alice Coachman, Lilly Purifoy.  All of those girls who went to the Olympics.  The only reason I didn't get a chance to try to go to the Olympics, the year that I thought I should've been good enough, 1946, they cancelled the Olympics because of the problems they were having with the European countries.  It was right after the war or just before the--right after the war and before the war.  We didn't get a chance to go.  I'm hoping I could have qualified.  I ran the fifty-yard dash. I ran the hundred-yard dash. I ran what was--I did what they called the broad jump.  But they changed it to the long jump because of the connotations of the word 'broad.'  And they changed into the long jump.  I think I may have qualified had I had the chance to go.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  So you were really good then?
Speaker 2: I thought I was good.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: [Laughs] Me too, with what we had to work with during those days.
Story_ID: 18733
Speaker 1: How was the black college circuit?  What was that like sort of?  You know, was there a pride amongst, you know, people when you'd go to other campuses. Were there, you know, did each one have its own personality sort of?
Speaker 2: Great pride.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Perhaps, in my opinion, the strongest academic institution at that time was probably Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  Tuskegee because of the great scholars who had been there.  Doctor [Frederick Douglass] Patterson, George Washington Carver, Booker T. Washington.  They all had been around in the environment at Tuskegee.  So Tuskegee was discovering scientific discoveries way back then.  And, of course, you had your other great universities.  You had Meharry Medical College [Nashville, Tennessee], Howard University [Washington, D.C.], Hampton Institute [Hampton, Virginia], Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee].  Atlant--now it's called Atlanta U. [Atlanta University, sic. now called Clark Atlanta University]--it's now a consortium of universities [Atlanta University Center consortium: Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, Spelman College, Morris Bown College].  Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], Bennett [College, Greensboro, North Carolina].  There were great historically black colleges.  They weren't getting as much state support as they should have gotten.  At that time the private institutions probably got--I don't think they got any state help.  They were church-related.  They were like Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida].  The Methodist Church kept Bethune-Cookman going.  Incidentally, that was my first job.
Story_ID: 18734
Speaker 1: You graduate from Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  Do you take any time off or do you head--you decide you're going to go straight on to graduate school.
Speaker 2: I went--well when I graduated, I got a job at the Bethune-Cookman College [Daytona Beach, Florida].  Because Bethune gave me a job.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.
Speaker 2: In 1946, the year I graduated--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I went to Bethune-Cookman as a young teacher.  I was just turned twenty years old.  And I stayed there for one year.  Because I --when I got there, I saw the need.  If I were going to be a college teacher, I needed a master's degree.  And that's when I decided I wanted to go and get the master's degree and that's when I was kept out of all the college system, the university system.
Speaker 1: Were there any, any people that discouraged you and said you didn't need a masters or why should you go on?  Was there any--.
Speaker 2: Yes.  A lot of people said that if you can't go to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida] or FSU [Florida State University, Tallahassee, Florida], why are you trying to get a master's?  You can stay here at Bethune-Cookman and you can take courses or wherever you can find to take them.  Because you weren't going to any segregated college.  But I just had this same little push.  This little zest for more learning.  I want to know more about what I was doing.  And that's why.
Speaker 1: You know, now what's unique about this experience is that this is your first time really away from home.  Right?  I mean--,
Speaker 2: Well, you're right.
Speaker 1: --in a way. And out of Florida--,
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Out of Florida.
Speaker 1: --and definitely out of the South.
Speaker 2: Right.  And also out of the country.  This is perhaps--having come to [U.S.] Congress really opened up new doors for me.  To travel to other countries to see how other people live and how they govern themselves and that came to me when I came to Congress.
Story_ID: 18735
Speaker 1: I've never seen so many books and I've never seen a library like I saw there [at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I was just fascinated with the difference between what I had been accustomed to at Florida A&M [University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]. The limited, segregated kinds of library facilities and what they had at the University of Michigan.  Also, the entire university was different. Better exposure to class rules. Better exposures to scholars from all over the world.  Better exposure to--in terms of the athletic program that I was trying to follow.  But when I got there naturally, I went into things of a more academic nature in that there, I concentrated on trying to get training in public health knowing that when I came back to Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida], I was going to be with the health department as well as athletics. So as I--they had great public health facilities. Doctors from the medical school taught us. It was just different, now. But I went there and got into the [Civil Rights] Movement too.  Because the black students when I got there, were marching and demonstrating because we couldn't straighten our hair in the dormitories. They--and I didn't live in the dorm.  But the ones who lived in the dorm were not allowed to straighten their hair. I was shocked. I said, "I left a segregated place and came to another one."  Not equally segregated, but I said, "It--the struggle continues."  And I'm--I got involved in that.  And I remember I joined the Students for Democratic Action because they were trying to do some things to change the university around and they were able to do so.  So, there was a difference.  There was--it was much less segregated.  It was--in terms of educational facilities it wasn't segregated at all. You could live in a dorm. You could go any place you wanted if you had the money. But in terms of the rights, it was different.  That is, the right of a student to look her best. Or was it--but we went--the university was the same as any other university.  The doors were open.  Academically it was outstanding.  And, of course, I must have done well there.  And I did.  They have honored me twice there.  I was the commencement speaker for the school of kinesiology [University of Michigan Division of Kinesiology, Ann Arbor, Michigan] a year ago.  And now this year I've been invited back to be--to receive the most distinguished alumnus award.  So, I must have done all right while I was there, and after as well.  But it was--it is a great university.  It's a great university to this day, the University of Michigan.
Speaker 2: Now did you find that--how many black students?--
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) But I held my own because of my training from Florida A&M.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And explain that.
Speaker 1: Well because I had learned how to study at Florida A&M. I had learned that--my teachers there were so good and they were so hard on us. And I don't mean in sort of a strident way.  But they were disciplined and they made us be disciplined.  That's why I made it. 'Cause I did not have the educational background. I was with other students who had a much better academic and educational background. Much better. I mean just eons away from where I was.  But because Florida A&M had taught me how to be disciplined, how to study and how to seek more and more knowledge, that's why I made it there.
Story_ID: 18736
Speaker 1: How many black students were there at the time you think?
Speaker 2: Quite a few.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) There were?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) At the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan]?  Oh, yes. See, it's very near Detroit [Michigan]. See, Ann Arbor is this--it's a little city where the University of Michigan is located. And there's Detroit, and it's a big midwestern university.  And it's one of the Big Ten [collegiate athletic conference] football schools. So they had quite a few black students. I don't know the number but there were quite a few. But they were mostly from the state of Michigan. Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you find a difference between you and the other black students?  You know, since you were from the South?  Did you find that there was any friction or, you know, any lack of acceptance?  Or anything?
Speaker 2: Well, I think in a way they thought they were better than we were.  Yeah.  They thought they had been better educated and--that happens today. To this day, some of the northern black students think they're better because they've been exposed to more educational horizons early in life, than we have.  But then sooner or later they learn better.  But yes, there was quite a difference.  I remember Lenny Moore and Bob Mann were the great football players when I was there during those time.  Lenny Moore was very friendly and Bob Mann really wasn't.  But Lenny Moore was.  But they were--and Chuck Farnbow was--and that was way back in the day as they say.  But they were outstanding 'cause they were great athletes.  And the University of Michigan has been known for its law school [University of Michigan Law School], its academic programs and its great athletic programs.  So I was really in the best place. I could go to get a background in the field I had chosen to pursue.
Story_ID: 18737
Speaker 1: Now you were there [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan] a year, right?
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: One year.
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: So you come--so you spend this year away.  When you come back, have you changed in any way?
Speaker 2: I think so. I was a much better teacher. Because I really learned how to research things there. You really learn how to broaden your horizons mentally and educationally. And my students benefited from that. When I went back to Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida] they benefited from the fact that I had really learned how people learn--particularly adults. And I think they also benefited from--I had learned how to really teach. I really learned how to teach and how to apply knowledge to a cognitive aspect of learning. I had the background--that is, I was disciplined. And I learned that at Florida A&M [University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  When I came back from Michigan, it was altogether different. My students had a much broader aspect of what's going on in the world.
Speaker 1: Now do you think that--now you were in charge of both the physical education department and who--?
Speaker 2: And biology.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) And biology.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) But I was not in charge of biology.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I taught biology.  I taught anatomy and physiology.  But I was not head of that department.  I was a teacher.
Story_ID: 18738
Speaker 1: You were quoted by saying that a lot of Mary McLeod Bethune--a great deal of her rubbed off on you.
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: But I want you to talk more in detail about your relationship with--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) All right.
Speaker 1: Ms. Bethune.
Speaker 2: All right.  Mrs. Bethune--the year I came to Bethune-Cookman College [Daytona Beach, Florida] was the year Mrs. Bethune was retiring.  And she was still there.  And she was ready then to be named the emeritus.  So she was the one who gave us our orientation.  And she taught us a lot.  She was a very proud woman.  And she taught us that the day was already here when we would be known for the color of--not for the color of our skin.  That's the first time I'd heard that.  And for the--but for the content of our character.  Since then, that has become a shibboleth. And Mrs. Bethune had a shibboleth that she taught everybody and that was, "Leaning on the everlasting arms."  And she was good at it.  She related to how Christianity is so important and how you must carry it with you all of your life.  And she was a strict disciplinarian.  She used to get on me about short dresses, because they were very short dresses.  And when I came to Bethune-Cookman, most of the clothes I had, my mother had made them.  And they were short.  And I was very little, and had very long legs.  So she says, "Where're you going in those short dresses."  I remember that.  And she used to tell us that we would have to do what it took to be great.  She talked about how it took to be great.  And how she had been an advisor to presidents.  And she always had someone great--with great status at Bethune-Cookman.  If it weren't John D. Rockefeller, it was Mr. Procter from Procter & Gamble [Corporation].  If it weren't one of those people, it was [Mohandas K.] Gandhi, the Prime Minister of India [Jawaharlal Nehru]  or his wife, [sic, daughter] Mrs. [Indira] Gandhi,  or some great world figure Mrs. Bethune would have there.  And she taught us to try to--and sometimes she used to turn around and say, "My heart goes out to you boys and girls here at Bethune-Cookman."  She was very much interested in women.  I think Mrs. Bethune was perhaps one of the earliest feminists now that I know what feminists are all about and how she keeps trying to inspire the woman to go further like she did and how she started with five little girls and a dollar and a half and how she parlayed that into a big fine institution like Bethune-Cookman.  And how she used to over on Miami Beach and carry the choir over there just to raise money for that college.  Ms. Bethune did it all.  And she sort of taught us that this is the way you have to do if things don't exist.  You have to make them exist.  And she used to have all kinds of saying around the school like, "All signs points to God." And, "Enter to learn, depart to serve." And she was one that had all kinds of shibboleths and inspiring mottos around.  And Bethune-Cookman was a very poor college during those days.  And it was a very small college, but it was church-related. So we really, really--the worship part of education and how it--how leading a good life is so important.  And how sticking with the family values is so important.  She was teaching that long time ago.  Now this was in the '40s [1940s].  And she was teaching this and she was inspiring us to do this.  But she was a very strict disciplinarian.  If you didn't do the right thing, Mrs. Bethune would fire you.  And she let it be known that year that she had left there--that that's what she was there for, to sort of separate the ones who needed to be there and those who didn't need to be there.  And she would--her example, you know, just to live by Mary McLeod Bethune's example was something--to have been counselor to presidents.  President [Franklin D.] Roosevelt and Mrs. [Eleanor] Roosevelt always used Mrs. Bethune--not used her, but they sought her counsel.  And she started the National Council of Negro Women, she started that.  Years ago she saw the need to organize black women and she started it.
Story_ID: 18739
Speaker 1: Dorothy Height was a young woman during those days and Ms. [Mary McLeod] Bethune got her started.  And look at Dorothy Height today.  And those--these are women that I had--I got to meet in my young life.  I was just twenty years old when I went to Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida] in the stage where I was very impressionable and I could learn and I could model myself after these women.
Speaker 2: Now did she--what--?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Excuse me.  Mrs. [Marjorie Stewart] Joyner--Mrs. Joyner was a woman that was outstanding with the beauticians of this country.  She used to come to Bethune-Cookman a lot.  Mrs. Joyner. She was a good friend of the woman [Madame C. J. Walker] who started this whole process in terms of straightening our hair and being a businesswoman.  But Mrs. Joyner--I'm trying--I--her first name escapes me.
Speaker 2: Marjorie?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: She was in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Right.  Because she just passed--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) She came to Bethune-Cookman often.  Because she was a friend of Mrs. Bethune's.  And she used to speak to us.  And we just--I had so many--Dorothy Anderson--Marian Anderson used to come to Bethune-Cookman.  Mrs. Bethune got all these people there.  And this to me was, another compounding of what I had learned at Florida A&M [University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].
Speaker 2: So now do you--when did she start Bethune-Cookman?  Do you know the year she started?
Speaker 1: Oh goodness! It's a shame.  I should know that.  It should be written on my forehead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  But she was Methodist herself?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you said--.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She was Methodist.  And when she came to Bethune-Cookman, she started that school by her affiliation with the Methodist Church that came out of South Carolina there.  She started over in, where was it, Tola?  Jacksonville [Florida].  And then it moved to Bethune-Cookman.
Speaker 2: Now so you--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) She--I mean combined it with a school that was in Jacksonville, Cookman School [Cookman Institute for Men].
Speaker 2: Was there anything else significant about your time at Bethune-Cookman? I mean you taught there for ten years.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 2: Did you get bored eventually, or was--?
Speaker 1: Never.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I never got bored.  I learned how to make do and how to make something out of very little.  And that's something Mrs. Bethune taught. I said she was a conservationist because she taught us to do something with what we had and to try to work hard to make the school better.  We had to sacrifice.  We had to do things that you weren't paid to do.  That's why it doesn't hurt me to do extra work because there, every Sunday you were in a community meeting.  Whether you had something else to do or not, you went to that community meeting.  And you went to vesper every Sunday night.  That started at Florida A&M, but at Bethune-Cookman it was mandatory that you go to that community meeting which started at three [o'clock p.m.] every Sunday.  And Mrs. Bethune taught that routine over and over again.  She taught Christianity over and over again.  She taught sacrifice over and over again.  And I learned it and I'm still living in that mode to this day--things that I learned from Mary McLeod Bethune.  And she was a great articulate woman.  She could speak and hold you spellbound.  You could listen to Ms. Bethune for an hour and not become bored, as she talked about her philosophy of life and her experience and how she raised her family almost by herself, as well.  She had a son who lived there at the college.  He was Mrs. Bethune's only son.  But she also had a grandson.  And to see how Mrs. Bethune went from very little to great, magnificent figure in this country.  So my experience with--has been so--I'm just gifted I'll tell you.  Gifted because of my experiences, educational experiences.
Story_ID: 18740
Speaker 1: What happens that you, you know, decide to leave Bethune-Cookman College [Daytona Beach, Florida]?
Speaker 2: All right.  When I--I met my husband at Bethune-Cookman College and I married there. I didn't marry him there, we went to Tallahassee to my home to get married.  But we had two children.  And the going got pretty rough in the marriage.  And I decided it would be better--we both decided, at least I did, really--because of the salary at Bethune-Cookman was so very small and I had these two young girls, and I had made a decision which really wrecked my mind, really, that I was gonna break my marriage.  And I did.  It was working, but it wasn't working.  And then my husband had some physical problems which I don't need to talk about on--but it had to do with alcohol.  So I decided that my two girls would do better if I were--I loved him dearly, but I divorced him.  I got in the--I started the divorce process.  And I got a job--I've been so lucky.  I never had to seek a job.  When I decided to leave Bethune-Cookman, Florida A&M [University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] had already recruited me, to teach there.  So I left with my two little girls and I got a better salary.  It wasn't much, but I got a better salary and I was with my mother.  My mother was still living in Tallahassee.  I moved in with her with my two little girls, and we lived in one bedroom in my mother's house, and she went back into her nurturing role again.  And I taught, and during the day when I was teaching, she kept my little girls.  And that's how I got my start at Florida A&M until I was able to move out into my own little apartment.  But I left Bethune-Cookman for that reason, because I was recruited by Florida A&M, and it was supposed to be the zenith during those days.  And I was happy.  I was just ecstatic that my university wanted me back, so.
Speaker 1: The place where you got your start.
Speaker 2: That's right.  That's right.
Speaker 1: So now then--you were still teaching physical ed?
Speaker 2: Still teaching physical education.  And now I had gone--I was now into supervising teachers.  Because I had gone to the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan] and I had a very strong background in education.  So when I got back to Bethune-Cookman, and then going to FAMU [Florida A&M University], then I started supervising the students at Florida A&M who were going into teacher education and they wanted to become teachers in physical education. So I got to be the supervising person at that time.
Speaker 1: So you were at FAMU for how long? For--.
Speaker 2: I stayed now for three years.
Speaker 1: For three years?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I left Bethune-Cookman. I was at Bethune-Cookman '47 [1947], '48 [1948], all the way up to '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: '58 [1958], right.
Speaker 2: Then I went to Florida A&M and I stayed three years.
Speaker 1: To '61 [1961].
Story_ID: 18741
Speaker 1: I got recruited again. Didn't have to seek the job.They [Miami-Dade Community College, Miami, Florida] found me. Coach [Alonzo Smith 'Jake'] Gaither and the baseball coach, Dr. Moore, told me that Bethune-Cookman [College, Dayton Beach, Florida] wanted me to come there and they had recommended me. So--and the salary was almost double what I was making at Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]. And I was now recruited to come to Miami-Dade Community College. And that was the first year that college was put together. And they were seeking--it was segregated when I went there. They had the Miami-Dade Community College, the black college--the black section was at [Miami] Northwestern Senior High School [Miami, Florida] and the white was at Central High School. It was segregated when I got there.  So they needed--they had a white campus and they had a black campus.  And at that time, they thought they needed me for the black campus. So I went. But we integrated that the first year I was there.  And we worked hard and we let the administration know. We--I told 'em, "I wasn't going to teach in a separated university. I'd been in one too long--segregated university."  And that I could teach whites as well as I could teach blacks. So it turned out that the next year that I was there, well the entire institution was integrated. And I was teaching all races, colors and creed with great, great success.
Speaker 2: And that was--and that was really the start of the community college system--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) It started--.
Speaker 2: I mean nationwide, really.
Speaker 1: That was--that's right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It started and Florida was one of the early ones in the community college movement and I was--it was one of the best, I would say educational experiences that higher education has ever had.
Speaker 2: And why do--.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Very successful.
Speaker 2: Why do you say that?  What was the whole concept behind the community college?
Speaker 1: The whole concept was equal access.  That you did not have to have an A average to go to a community college in that it was, open door.  That is, you may have been thirty-five or forty years old and you missed going to college.  You could come back to the community college without having to pass an entrance test.  To say that look--it was sort of like some of the universities had a meritocracy, and if you didn't have a certain score you couldn't get in them.  But the community college had an open door.  People who were adults who needed a second chance or high school students who needed to go and who could not afford to leave their community.  That's why it was called community.  They could not afford to go to FAMU [Florida A&M University].  They could not afford to go to the University of Florida [Gainesville, Florida].  So they could go to the community college with very little tuition.  It was very, very cheap to go there.  Good facilities.  It was state supported, county supported as well.  So that was a great experience.  It's one of the great--it was a great experiment--successful experiment.  They kind of copied California.  'Cause this movement started in California.  And then when it moved to Florida, it really was widespread.  And luckily, I was in on that early part of the community college movement.
Story_ID: 18742
Speaker 1: Was it really at Miami-Dade [Community] College [Miami, Florida] that you start getting more active in the community and (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you describe that?
Speaker 2: In that, when I was in Tallahassee [Florida], and also when I was at Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida], I did not have the freedom to participate in community affairs as much.  I participated, but not to the extent that I did when I got--because the word community is important at the community college.  And if you teach there, one of the things you get judged on or evaluated on, is how much you're able to extend yourself in the community, and how much you're able to give of your time--free time.  Plus, my children were growin' up too.  And I was--I started out in the PTA [Parent Teacher Association]. And I just loved the PTA.  I didn't realize it was a form of politics.  That's what it was.  You had to work.  You had to be elected.  You had to sell pies.  You had to raise funds for the school.  And my little children were in school at Holmes Elementary [School, Miami, Florida]. And I was a--at first I was not the chairperson of the PTA.  But because I worked so hard, Garth Reeves, who's the editor of the ['Miami Times'] newspaper there, decided he would elect me as the chairperson, and I did.  And from there I started reaching out into all aspects.  And when it was time to go before the school board, they called me and says, "Carrie, we want you to go."  I became the spokesperson.  Then a little bit after that, as my children were growin' up, guess what happened?  The [U.S. President Lyndon B.] Johnson administration came in.  And that brought about the Great Society [federal social programs], where they begin then to look at cities.  They begin to look at some of these societal problems.  And I reached out even more then into some of the programs that were there.
Speaker 1: You know, before--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Community college gave me time.  That's what I'm saying.
Speaker 1: It gave you time.
Speaker 2: And the opportunity.
Speaker 1: And the--okay.
Speaker 2: To do that.  That's right.
Speaker 1: And the exposure.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now you were--because--was your mother still alive at this point?
Speaker 2: At first.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: So does she help?  Because you're a single parent at this point too?
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother helped but my sister--see my mother was in Tallahassee [Florida]. My sister Evelyn is the one who was my caretaker or caregiver during that time.  She lived in a little place called South Bay which was right on the muck, they called it.  And she would help me in the summers with my children.  But I struggled when I got to Miami-Dade.  And then I was a single parent and I had to take care of my children as well as work.  And that happened, and, you know, I married again when I got to Miami.  Not the first year, but I did marry the second time.  And I had another child.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Wait!  Wait a minute.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) This--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When--I met my second husband in Miami when I was teaching at the community college.  And that's where my third child, Kendrick, who is now a state senator.
Story_ID: 18743
Speaker 1: Since you have been in physical education during this whole time,  are there people that, you know, people would know, that were students of yours during that time, and then went on to have great athletic careers?  Are any of those--?
Speaker 2: Yes. John Chaney who is the [basketball] coach of Temple [University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the Temple Owls, was a student of mine.  And he is--he still remembers the fact that I taught him and how tough I was on him, but he still loves me. And he's now coach at Temple.  Just any number of them.  I'm trying to think of some of the others who had great careers in both pro football as well as pro basketball, great dancers.  'Cause I was a dance teacher as well.  I had people who went on to New York [New York] and got into dance companies starting out at Bethune-Cookman [College, Daytona Beach, Florida] with me and at--with Miami-Dade [Community College, Miami, Florida].  So there were many of 'em.  The one that I can recall instantly, however, is John Chaney.
Speaker 1: And while we're on,  I just wanna ask this one question about, I usually--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Excuse me.  And many of them did not go on to athletic careers, but they went on to other careers.  Like Dr. Hubert Hensley who is a great physician in California, was one of my students.  And they all took variant ways in life.  But athletics--that started them.
Story_ID: 18744
Speaker 1: You had mentioned something, you know, earlier about how athletics really helped you in many ways.  You know, you'd learned some lessons early in life about--,
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Picking yourself up, you know--dust--and getting back up and competing.  And that has been very helpful to you.
Speaker 2: It has.
Speaker 1: And I was wondering if there are any other lessons you think that, you know, were important in athletics?  And then the other part of that question is, you know, blacks have been able--that's one of the area that we've been able to excel.  But, you know, you came out of a segregated system and that was--you came out of a segregated system.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yes I did.  Yes.  I think athletics will parlay you into a lot of things.  People during the time I came along thought that all football players and all basketball players should not be scholarly students--should not be scholarly.  That's something that-- that's a myth.  I always instilled in my students the push for excellence, to do very well in academic subjects and not just be another physical being just to be a dumb dodo just because you have a great physical prowess--that you need mental powers as well.  And it helped.  So there's a lot to be parlayed. There's a lot of lessons.  One, you learn endurance.  Not only physical endurance, but mental endurance.  You learn that through athletics.  You learn precision.  I mean, you have to make a move and you have to know why you make that move.  Because you--perhaps you are guarding somebody or you running against somebody.  You gotta learn how to preserve your energy.  You gotta learn how to use your strength when it's time when you get in the last leg of the race--how to kick when it's time to kick.  So you have to have what I call--I guess you'd call it reciprocal kinds of learning.  That is, you learn to apply what you--what your physical body tells you so that the mental body can take over.  So you learn persistence.  You don't give up hardly.  You learn to endure--to take it to the--just when you think you're defeated, all of a sudden, you shoot a basket and that's the end of the game.  So you learn that.  That applies to everything you do.  And the competitiveness applies to everything you do--to not be afraid.  'Cause during those days, girls were supposed to be shy, you know, and they weren't supposed to be able to achieve at anything.  Well that made me push even harder when things came up with Title IX to make women equal in athletics and in sports.  Because when I came along, we didn't get the kind of scholarships that the young men got.  So now the young women are gettin' scholarships.  They're goin' on to be doctors, lawyers, or space pilots and everything else because of the equality which they get now. So, yes, sports taught me a lot.  And to this very day they still teach me.  And it also teaches you how someone from a very poor background, if they apply themselves, they'll get a chance to go to college.  And some of these innate abilities which they have will be identified.  And they can parlay that into whatever they become.  So it doesn't really--you don't have to begin with a great brawny physique to do well.  There're sports that you don't need a brawny physique to work at.  You could become a good tennis player.  You can do like Arthur Ashe did, to become one of the greatest tennis players.  Like Gibson, Althea Gibson who was a great, great athlete.  She started at Florida A&M [University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And Althea Gibson is still a great person.  She's in New York.  She's still a role model for women.  She didn't have the opportunities that women have today like the Williams sisters [tennis players, Venus and Serena Williams].  'Cause she would have been a pro forever, had she had the opportunity.  It just goes to show you how segregation keeps you out of things.  And I always tell Tola and the rest of my staff, "I think had I come to [U.S.] Congress sooner, or had I gone to the legislature sooner, say like in my twenties, oh I would've--even though I strive very hard and I work very hard, I perhaps would have been the speaker or the--over the--I would have been a senator, or I would have even striven to be president. But what kept us out was segregation."
Story_ID: 18745
Speaker 1: How did I get to go to [Florida] state legislature?  There was a woman who was elected as a first black woman from Dade County up in Florida to go the legislature.  Her name was Gwen Cherry.  All this was history making.  There'd never been a black woman in the state legislature.  Gwen Cherry was a graduate of Florida A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  She was the first--one of the first black lawyers in Florida.  First black woman lawyer.  She graduated from Florida A&M's law school.  She was elected to the Florida state legislature.  And I'm sure that had to be in the early '70s [1970s].  When she went, she had a very good record in the legislature.  And she died an untimely death.  She got in an accident.  And all this time now I had been this volunteer and everything.  Working at the Model Cities Program, being an advocate for people, being a spokesperson, getting the students into college, advising students for freedom college.  Helping just wherever I could, 'cause remember now, I was at the [Miami-Dade] Community College [Miami, Florida].  And I was also a person who had children in the local school system and was advocating for a strong educational program.  But anyway, the people you and I now call 'grassroots people' said, "We want Carrie to run."  Well the power structure said, "No. Carrie has never been into politics.  She's only helped Ms. Cherry in her little campaigns.  But she's never run for anything.  So we don't think she should be the one.  We think a man should go.  Because the man ran recently and their name is out there, you know."  One of the men by the name of James Burke had run before.  And when Gwen Cherry died, this was a special election.  And I think it was a matter of two months that we had to get ready to run in that election.  First of all, in the primary.  So I told them.  They had what they called a little screening process.  And, of course, when I went before them, I told them, I said, "I think I can win. Because after all, everyone knows me.  In one way or the other I've helped someone.  I've taught almost every adult that's come through college in this state in recent years."  And remember, I taught first at Bethune-Cookman College [Daytona Beach, Florida].  Then I taught at Florida A&M.  All these were adults.  I came back to Miami-Dade Community College.  Taught adults again.  So the people I taught were voting age.  They didn't realize that.  So I said, "I think I can win this."  They said, "Oh no.  Your name is not out there."  So they chose a man.  But not only did he run, but ten other people ran in the primary.  But the people over at the churches told me, "Now look, you gonna run."  I said, "I don't think I should run because it would split the black community.  Because the screening committee has chosen James Burke."  They said, "Oh you're gonna run."  So they drafted me.  That's how I got to run the first time.  There's a church called St. John Baptist Church, Overtown in Miami, one of the poorest sections in Miami.  That's where the decision was made by the grassroots people that, "Carrie Davis Meek was going to run."  So I cried because I didn't want to divide the community and I was being philosophic [sic. philosophical] about it.  So, I ran.  There were ten other people who ran against me in the primary.  I beat them all.  Only one was left.  And that was a white woman who lived over in another part of town who had a lot of money, who had gone up to Tallahassee and chosen her apartment, 'cause she was so sure.  But I got her in a run-off.  So when I got her in the run-off, she just knew that she was gonna defeat me and she was going to Tallahassee.  Well my people rallied around me.  We worked very hard.  We didn't have any money.  But we worked very hard.  Okay.  Her name was Joann DeLoach.  So I beat Joanne DeLoach (ph.) in the run off.  I still had a Republican to run against.  By then the Cubans were just beginning to feel their muscle in Miami.  They'd come in and they had their own candidates that they wanted to win this seat in the legislature.  Well I ran against a Cuban, a Republican.  I beat him.  And that's how I got to Tallahassee.  And we did it with sheer grassroots--support, with the black community being the difference.  But, of course, I think the people in the white community and the Cubans thought that I wasn't going to campaign in the white community.  I went in every community.  I didn't even know Spanish.  I went in the Cuban community.  I got some of his votes in--out of the Cuban community 'cause people don't care what color you are.  They wanna be sure that you gonna do something to help them.  And I made that impression.  And my record showed that I would go out for all of the people.  And that's how I got in the state legislature.
Speaker 2: You know, but that's even somewhat of an amazing story.  Because--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] It is.
Speaker 2: A lot of times it takes people maybe, you know, two times at least--You know, running.  You know, because they learn.  Even though, you know, they're well-intentioned.  But you just think it was the grassroots? Or you think you--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] The grassroots people and the fact that I'd paid my dues.  I'd been out there working.  People wanted to know, "What do you do?  What did you do in the community? What groups did you affiliate?  Where have you worked?  Who're you helping?"  See, if you haven't paid your dues and no one knows that you've tried to help, then they're not gonna vote for you.  They think you're just going out to try to get a name for yourself.  But I had that background.  I had worked very hard in the community.  I had a record of starting organizations, sticking with them.  Had a--oh, the number of students I--see I use my strength.  And that's education.  I'd helped so many students get into college.  I'd helped so many students get scholarships.  I'd helped them go away to grad school.  'Cause all it takes is a little push and a little counseling and gettin' connections and asking people to help this student go.  Well parents don't forget that.  People don't forget that when you help them get in school.  They don't.  So that's what happened.
Story_ID: 18746
Speaker 1: Well first of all, I forgot to tell you about my mentor in politics.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Tell me.
Speaker 1: Athalie Range.  Mrs. Range is a pioneer in the black community.  She owns a funeral home.  And she's the one who trained pretty much all of the black woman who ran and the black men as well.  I mean in order to go into politics in Miami [Florida], you have to know M. Athalie Range.  Because as a funeral director [Range Funeral Home], she does all this social work for people.  She does--she helps people get on food stamps. The same thing that politicians do.  So they all know Mrs. Range, and she knows everybody.  After all, when you're a funeral director and you have a funeral once or twice a week, you get to know all the preachers.  You get to know all the people in the churches.  So Mrs. Range took me under her wing.  And she really taught me how to run for office.  She taught me how long to stay in meetings.  Not to talk too much, what to say,  how to conduct myself. She really trained me.  And we call her Mama Range now.  So, that's one thing I had in my favor.  That Mrs. Range supported me and pushed me when I first went into politics.  And taught me how you achieve in politics.  By being sure you don't make promises that you can't fulfill.  Being sure that you don't heighten expectations.  Those kinds of things.
Speaker 2: So she taught you righ--after you got elected?  Or she was part of that?
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Prior to it.
Speaker 2: Prior to it?
Speaker 1: Prior to it.  See when she found out that I was gonna persevere, when I showed up in the primary, you know, then Mrs. Range decided, "This girl is gonna work and she's gonna be a winner."  So she started helping me.  Giving me advice.  Helping me run my campaign.  There was another lady who helped me too, Barbara Carey [Carey-Shuler], who is now a [County] Commissioner in Miami.  Well Mrs. Range was sort of like the mentor.  Both of our mentors.  She really was.  Taught us a lot about politics.  And how to run and how to win.
Speaker 2: That's good.  So when you got elected, was she the guiding hand sort of in that process?  Because you know, that's pretty heady.  You know, you come out from back.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know, you win.  You know--people.--You got drafted.  It's not like you--
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Well people knew that she was behind me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That helped a lot.  Particularly in the churches.  That when Mrs. Range would take me to a church, and she would go up and speak on my behalf, well the people say, "Well now she must be okay.  Because Mama Range is here helping her.  We've heard about her.  But we know Mama Range first hand."  So that helped me a lot having Mrs. Range in my corner.  And having--they knew also that I knew Gwen Cherry, 'cause they wanted to see a black woman.  The whites in the community wanted a black woman to win.  They did not want a Cuban to win.  So they threw their support behind me.  Because they wanted a black woman to take over [Florida state representative] Gwen Cherry's seat.  That also was a edge that helped me win.

Speaker 1: What's this whole experience, you know, being in the House side of the, you know, of the [Florida state] legislature?  What is that--?  What do you learn, quickly?  You know, because you have a lot of demands.  Even though you've been, you know, you've been very active in the community--,
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm sure the demands are becoming even more [unclear]--,
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] But I had to make--I made sacrifices that I wished I hadn't had to make.  That is, neither one of my marriages--both of my marriages did not last as much as I wanted them to.  I loved both of my husbands.  I wished that I could of kept both of them.  But the demands, I think, now that I have a chance to look back and evaluate it.  The demands on my time, to me, had I had to do it again, I wouldn't do as much.  I wouldn't put as much time in politics as I do.  And as I did then.  I had young children.  I dragged them to every meeting.  I guess that's why one of them got to be a senator [Kendrick Meek].  He slept under my desk many nights.  Because I should've been at home, really.  But it was just that I've always had this push to--for excellence.  And so when I got into politics I said, "I'm gonna try to be the best."  So I start studying.  I'd stay there late at night.  I started learning how to write proposals and how to make legislative initiatives.  And that took work.  That took study.  So--and then all these meetings that I attended--when I look back, I think that I could have been better, you know.  And it may have made, particularly my last marriage work.  It may have.  But the demands on my time and my being at meetings all the time and pulling the children to the meetings.  Staying out late, bringing them back in late at night, I think that had a lot to do with the demise of it really, yes.  I think my family's life, in terms of the fact that I loved my husbands, I loved my children, would have been much better had I been, I think, a better wife.  I was an excellent mother.  But I could've been a better wife the way I look at it.
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Politics took away from it.
Speaker 1: Took away from it.
Speaker 2: Yes, it did.
Speaker 1: But do you think realistically?  You know, hindsight is often twenty-twenty.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you think you could've done that easily that way?  It's hard to bal--you know, learn how to balance.
Speaker 2: Politics is very hard on a young woman, see.  If I didn't have children, I probably would have had more time.  I mean the time that I put in it would have been, I would say, the right kind of time.  But I think some of the quality time that I should have spent at home with my husband.  I didn't do it.  I was in the meetings and I was away someplace.  I was in Tallahassee or I was someplace.  But then I was dragging the children now.  They were going with me which meant a divided life as well.  But you're right.  There's things that I learned in politics that I never would have learned had I been a housewife.  How to take care of things and how to make it equal.  And even my children progressed because I was in politics.
Story_ID: 18748
Speaker 1: Now you're saying the--state legislature--is it forty people? You said--,
Speaker 2: Forty people in the Senate [Florida state legislature].
Speaker 1: In the Senate.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] But 120 in the House.
Speaker 1: In the house.  Okay.
Speaker 2: See, I spent two years in the house with 120 other people--119 other people. But then I was elected after one term, two years, to the Senate.  And I spent ten more years there.  So.
Speaker 1: And did you like the Senate side?
Speaker 2: I loved it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was easier to get things done there.  Much easier.
Speaker 1: Because you're on for longer, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Because you don't--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Yes.  Plus, I was on for four years.  Plus there weren't as many people that you had to win over.  You could get your votes much more easily than you could in the [Florida] House [of Representatives].  And it was more of  a deliberative body than it was in the House.  In the House there was so many of them, there wasn't much deliberation.  I mean they wanted things out of there.  And you had to get it out fast or you didn't get it.  But in the Senate, with it being a very, I don't say slow process, but a very deliberate process.  Where you had fewer committees, it took fewer votes to have your bill passed and all of that.
Speaker 1: Did you find that you--you--now you became head of appropriations, right?  For the--
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Education.
Speaker 1: Education.
Speaker 2: I was head of the Education Subcommittee.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know, we have these subcommittees.  Like I'm on subcommittees here but I'm on the full Appropriations Committee.  Same way--That was the same way in the Florida Senate.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In the Florida Senate. Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was Chairman of Education Appropriations.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's always been my, pretty much, niche.
Speaker 1: Well that made sense given your background.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Story_ID: 18749
Speaker 1: Were there things that you were very proud of?  You know, that you were proudest of that you accomplished there, for your constituency--.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] All right.  Yes.
Speaker 1: You know, during your time?
Speaker 2: I think my greatest accomplishment in the Florida Senate and the Florida House [of Representatives] when I was there, number one, was I passed the Housing Surtax Bill.  I've always been very close to low-income people.  And I found out that there were two big needs.  That I felt were too big and that's education and housing.  And I was able to parlay my background in education into housing.  I was able to pass a bill called The Housing Surtax Bill which provided first and second mortgages for people who were unable to get them.  And that's been all the way back since 1982.  And as a result, we were then able for people who--to qualify for housing.  I didn't realize how important it was for someone to get a house.  And how someone reacts when they get a house for the first time.  It's a very emotional thing.  So we passed that bill and now people in the state of Florida, particularly in Dade County, any number of housing units have been made.  People have homes who couldn't get homes because they couldn't get a mortgage.  But now with the state--with the real estate, commercial real estate transaction being taxed and raising a certain amount of money every year, that a poor person can come and get a loan or outright grant to get a house.  That made a great difference.  And it's still going on.  They've expanded that bill now, it's all over Florida.  When this little surtax placed on commercial transactions, not even individual or private homeowners, but just commercial.  These big businesses that buy real estate.  And that to me, was one of the most significant things that I did in the Florida Legislature.  There were a lot of other things that I did, but I think that was, in terms of the quality of life, that was it.  The other thing that I was able to do was to provide--work hard to be sure that our state University of Florida A&M [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] was able to get doctoral programs.  Because before that times, very difficult for them to get doctoral programs.  I was a person behind Florida A&M being able to offer a Doctorate of Pharmacy.  They call it the Pharm.D. And because I was over the Education Subcommittee, we were able to push that through.  And now some of the most outstanding pharmacists in the state of Florida and all over this country, come from Florida A&M's pharmaceutical degree program they call the Pharm.D. There were many others but those were two that I felt were significant.  But most of them were in those two areas: housing and education.
Story_ID: 18750
Speaker 1: Did you have any disappointments that you had politically?  You know, where you felt that, you know, you either had losses or, you know, constituents, or people that you had faith in? Or I mean--were there any of those things that happened that were sort of, you know, disappointments in the whole process?  You know, or were--
Speaker 2: Well I think some of the scrutiny that's placed on black politicians has been, to me, a great disappointment.  I think sometimes they're overly scrutinized.  That other people who are in political office don't get the high degree of scrutiny.  And what becomes a great, great crime for African Americans sometimes, isn't that great with others.  That's not to say that in any way, I support criminal activity.  I do not.  I think that politicians should earn a decent living.  They should not take or abuse any of the monies that come through their hands nor should they abuse their power.  But I think many times, people like the politician from New York, [U.S. Congressman Adam Clayton] Powell [Jr.], was scrutinized in a way that he probably wouldn't've been had he been white.  Because, he was very, very vocal in his criticism of the inequities in this country.  So many of them, right here in the [U.S.] Congress, have been closely scrutinized even when they did things that I think other Congresspeople could've gotten away with.  Or it was a whim or they would've said well,  "That's just a tough part."  But now I don't believe in them taking money, at all.  Not at all.  White or black or anyone abusing that power.  No.  But I think that what's been a disappointment for me is that there haven't been many African Americans to come to Congress.  There should be many, many more.  And most of them were from the northern states.  They're not from the southern states.  But it's beginning to change somewhat.  That's why our [Congressional Black] Caucus now has quite a few Southerners on it.  But that's--they're--like [U.S. Congressman] Charlie Rangel has been so outstanding in the Congressional Black Caucus.  So has Bill [sic, Louis] Stokes.  They're all from northern cities and, of course, or California--[Ronald V.] Dellums and the rest of them.  But now we have new ones coming along who will be equally as good, myself included.
Story_ID: 18751
Speaker 1: What's interesting, and that's what I want to talk about, is that the time when, you know, people are starting to think about retiring.  You've--,
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: Been elected to the U.S. Congress.  And it's like the first--And let's talk about that, because--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Okay.
Speaker 1: There--even though you say, you know, I, you know, "That this was not or it's sad to say that, you know, I made history because I was--"
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: "The first one."
Speaker 2: That's right.  It is sad.
Speaker 1: I would like you to talk about it.
Speaker 2: And, you know, I must say to you in all candor, I wouldn't have been here had it not been for the way they redistrict--did the redistricting.  That--the Congress people and the people in the legislature--well the Congress couldn't do it because they--Only the legislature does redistricting.  But they kept us out by taking the blacks that were in our community and dividing  them up.  So that they could take their share of them and that left none for us.  So, as a result of it, Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Carrie Meek, took us 129 years to come to Congress.  When we did have Congress people from Florida who did outstanding jobs here. But we should've been here.  Because we reflected.  That's why when single-member districts came when we could really represent African American people, you would see more things done here for African Americans.  You would see the civil rights, moves that we've made.  You've seen how we fought so hard for the Haitians.  How we've tried to pay some of the debts that the black farmers have had.  How we played focus on--put a lot of focus on Africa when this country had not really given the kind of aid to Africa that they should have.  How we've been working so hard with the AIDS crisis.  Many times it takes people who are living in that community who have the kind of indigenous feeling toward the areas that we can push the kinds of things we pushed. And we've been very hard for minorities and we've worked very hard for women.  People who are under-served.  I think that the Congressional Black Caucus had really--they have--the Caucus has earned its stripes by working for under-served people.  But it took us--segregation kept us away from here really.  If we weren't from northern states or from western states, we couldn't get to Congress.  And to me that was inequity.  I keep mentioning that.  Because I didn't get here.  I came to Congress when I was sixty-six years old.  And most women are retired when they're that age.  But I was wide open when I got here.  I was ready.  I was really willing and able to be here but I'm seventy-five now.  Think of what I could've done and I could've been here as long as some of these men have been here.  Not as long as [U.S. Senator] Jesse Helms, but I could've been here long enough to make a great difference for society, as well as the African American community, minorities as well.
Speaker 1: Now you're saying that your election here was really caused by redistricting?  Or--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's how I got here.
Speaker 1: That's the only way you would've--
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] The only way.  And then the bill that caused me to be able to come here was defeated in the House.  In the House of Representatives, the map of the change and redistricting that had always kept us out was presented in such a way, that I could go to the Florida Senate.  And I could be in the Florida Senate at a time that I could change that congressional map. Or work on that congressional map that would give the three of us a chance to be here.  And they--we still had to go to court.  Corrine Brown took it to court,  because at the time it was changed, I would've been the only one that would've gotten here then.  At the time when the Florida redistricting map was changed, I would've been the only one.  Because I'm from an area that's well-populated by African Americans.  Corrine Brown nor Alcee Hastings would have been here.  But Corrine decided--she said, "My chances are so slim being from Duval county," she took it to court.  And, of course, the courts knew that that was an inequity.  All the time before, the redistricting kept African Americans out of Congress from the state of Florida.
Speaker 1: You came under what--Who was the president at that time?  Then it was--,
Speaker 2: When I came to congress?
Speaker 1: Who was it?
Speaker 2: It was [Bill] Clinton.
Speaker 1: Oh, Clinton was here.
Speaker 2: [Simultaneously] I came at the same time he did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  At the same time.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I came here in [19]92.
Speaker 1: Wasn't that a record number of women in that Congress?
Speaker 2: Yes it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The greatest they had, except this last time, yeah.
Speaker 1: But that time when he came it was the record number--,
Speaker 2: That's right
Speaker 1: of females.
Speaker 2: That's right. That's right.
Story_ID: 18752
Speaker 1: What are the things that you are proudest of?  I mean, you know, when you look--you've worked very much with the Haitians. You worked with--,
Speaker 2: [simultaneously] Yes.
Speaker 1: You passed the disabilities [Learning Differences Act of 1998], didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That helped a lot too.
Speaker 1: Also the Everglades Restoration?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm very proud of that. I'm also very proud of the fact that I worked very hard in housing.  In that I served on that subcommittee.  And I'm able to--my greatest accomplishment since I've been here is to get some equality in the funding that goes into American institutions. Particularly, black institutions.  I've been instrumental in being sure that the Empowerment Zone Bill [Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Enhancement Act of 1999] passes.  I've been sure that these--when they said, "The government is supposed to be putting back into low income communities," that they do so.  And I think my greatest accomplishment is the fact that God placed me on appropriations.  Where I could bring some equality in terms of funding in these communities.  Both in the terms of health care, in terms of education and in terms of housing.  And were there--You know, we--
Speaker 1: [simultaneously] 'Cause I think I told you about my passing the lupus bill [Lupus Research and Care Amendments].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well no you didn't--
Speaker 1: [simultaneously] Which was my greatest accomplishment.
Speaker 2: [simultaneously]  But I want to talk about that--too.  Because your sister died of lupus.
Speaker 1: [Simultaneously] Died of lupus.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And it's a disease that--it's a killer of women.  Particularly, women in their child-bearing years.  And, of course, lupus is a scourge.  It's a scourge.  It's a kind a disease that's--it causes more people to become ill than AIDS or any of the other autoimmune diseases.  And what it does, it's so silent, that it attacks your major organ systems.  The heart, the lungs, the kidneys, and it just--the respiratory system.  And before you know it, if you have lupus--it starts out like rheumatoid arthritis.  And it's so very hard to diagnose. And by the time you get it diagnosed, many times women are so sick they go--they have to go on dialysis or they have a heart attack or they have some kind of bleeding disorder.  So lupus has been such a terrible disease all these years.  My sister had it for many years before doctors were able to diagnose it.  And then I thought, I said, "This disease is so terrible," she couldn't--it ruined  her sight--and the medication they put you on is what, really the deleterious--that are the harmful effects come from the medication.  Many times when doctors don't know that the person has lupus.  So when I came to the [U.S.] Congress, my resolve was to try and find research and find money for funding research programs for lupus.  And to find respite care.  Money to help the patients.  Because many of these young women can't even hold their own babies.  They are so sick and their joints are so inflamed or they're so weakened by lupus.  So I took that as my charge when I came to Congress.  Two things I decided I would do when I would come to Congress.  One was to make the Haitian cause better and that to see if the Haitians could gain equality.  They had not received equality.  Haitians were at the cellar of notice here in the Congress.  But when I came to Congress, the years before I came here, the [Congressional] Black Caucus had been working on this, they really had.  People like Charlie Rangel, people like Don Payne from New Jersey.  The one from Brooklyn [New York]--Major Owens.  They'd been working on it.  But when I came, I brought new impetus because many of my constituents are Haitians.  And they left their children.  They left their families over in Haiti and the situation over in Haiti was just really terrible.  I mean there was killing of entire families.  Decapitation, cutting off of the arms and legs.  Just widespread cruelty and I got involved over in Haiti.  And the [Congressional] Black Caucus kind of pressed down, you know, when I came because they saw that the need was really in my district.  It was very tough.  And they chipped in and helped a great deal.  But I went before the Congress and I worked very hard to get the Haitian Care and Treatment Act passed. And I went back and forth to Haiti to bring children out of there who were being deprived of their freedom by what was left after the [Jean-Claude] Duvalier government.  And when [Jean-Bertrand] Aristide came in, I did everything I could to help him make things equal in Haiti.  It still isn't equal.  The situation in Haiti is very bad.  The United States has withdrawn its support.  All the things that we worked so hard to get, they have withdrawn most of this support because of political nuances in Haiti.  It's not all good.  But to have them cut off the funding or to stop it the way they did.  I think a humane way--a more humane way would've been to sort of phase it out and try very hard to train people who had been under the yoke of puritanical leadership all that time.
Story_ID: 18753
Speaker 1: Nothing in my mind or in my research or in my experience as devastating as the last [2000 Presidential] election.  First, it was devastating, number one, because many of my constituents' votes were not counted.  Now, they talk a lot about irregularities, but the data is there to show that there was a disparity in the black vote in terms of their being able to count it.  And what is an enigma, is why is it that so many precincts in black communities throughout the state of Florida were overlooked, discarded, just weren't counted.  Either it was because they had been purged from the roles because of some kind of irregularity again in Tallahassee [Florida] in the elections department.  The elections department said it wasn't their fault.  They said it was the supervisor of the elections.  No one takes credit for these problems.  The governor of the state of Florida [Jeb Bush] doesn't--he said he's not responsible.  The Secretary of State [Katherine Harris] say she's not responsible.  She passes it on down to one of her staff members.  He passes it on down to the supervisor of elections to say each one of them is an independent person in their own right.  So they can do whatever they want to do.  Number two, why is it that the absentee ballots were not handled administratively in such a way it would be fair?  That they were allowed in some counties, particularly [U.S. Representative] Corrine Brown's district, they allowed people to break into the sanctity where the absentee ballots are kept.  Well you aren't supposed to go in there. But they allowed elected officials and representatives of the Republican Party to go in and change or fill in information which was not on those ballots.  So, the 'Miami Herald' [newspaper] came at the end and they made this big, big study and in the end it showed--at least it appeared to them that things that we knew all the time.  That the poor voting machines, the inadequate ones were in black communities.  They were in black precincts.  Number one, what does that say?  It goes back to same separate and unequal stuff that I faced in education all my life.  Put the poor books in the black schools.  Put the worn out machines in the black communities so that all the irregularities can happen there.  Where you have whole communities are not counted.  Also, make it so that Haitians who are limited in their language--there's no one on the polls to help them.  So when they get there, they're turned around 'cause no one understands them.  So you gonna to tell me that was not some kind of debacle?  All the research has shown that it wasn't anything that was by design.  But I'm not dealing with design.  What happens is, there were people who were disenfranchised.  They were African American people.  They were people--poor people who should've had a better chance.  They were disabled people who couldn't even get into the polls because of all of the trash and all of the blockages around.  There were people on the polls who didn't know what they were doing in black precincts.  And in black precincts when someone made a mistake at the polls and you tried to call elections, you couldn't call them.  In white communities, they had computers, and these computers went right into the elections department.  So no one could ever tell me that things were done in Florida that were abuses.  Abuses were done in Florida.  And I think they've been goin' on a pretty long time.  But because it was a presidential election, and there was so much at stake, that the Ssecretary of State was able to be a member of President [George W.] Bush's election, team.  She was a member of his, election committee and so was his brother [Jeb Bush], the governor.  And I think they looked the other way when they shouldn't and I will say that until the end.  I know that Katherine Harris, and I'm not supposed to call names, but I know that she was not as dutiful as she should've been as Secretary of State.  She was not as dutiful as she was about when she should stop the vote. Or when it should not be counted.  And also the [U.S.] Supreme Court helped to elect the last president [George W. Bush].  I'll say that as long as I live.  Never in the history of this country has a Supreme Court ruled in favor of, of, of a candidate and they did it.  And they used--what is it?  Part of the law that gave them the chance to use it and they've never used it before.  I'm sorry, it slips me--the part of the law that they use to be sure that they made the decision that they did.  It was a law that was made way back when blacks were going through their frustration and segregation.  It'll come to me but right now--it was one that they use.  It's a legal term.  I'm sorry. I can't remember it right now.  But let me tell you what makes you know that things happen in Florida that should not have happened.  It happened in other cities, other states.  But Florida was much worse than anyone else. Much worse.  Go over in Duval County [Florida].  You go to Daytona Beach [Florida] where students were turned around, where highway patrolmen were blocking the way into the polls.  You go into a poll in Miami [Florida] where you're blocked.  There's no one there who speaks Creole, so you can't vote because you don't understand.  Everyone should have the right to vote.  Our fathers, forefathers died for the right to vote.  And it's just--I had to stand in line two hours and I'm a congressperson, to vote because I wanted to vote early.  My supervisor of elections made it difficult to have someone go to the polls on Thursday and Friday before the election.  He tried his very best to discourage it.  Said he didn't have enough computers.  Yet he had enough.  He could've set it up.  But he slowed it.  And I call it by all deliberate speed.  They slowed down the election.  In Dade County [Miami-Dade County] they slowed down the count, and wouldn't count it at first.  If it had not been for the Florida Supreme Court, they wouldn't have even counted it in Dade County.  So it's been the worse abuse known to man, what happened in this past election.
Speaker 2: What do you think is gonna be done to change that?  Or to make sure that things like that don't happen again?
Speaker 1: Well Florida has done what I call the first step. It's just in my opinion a cursory step.  Because they outlawed--they're gonna give money.  They passed an election law.  They call it the Election Reform Bill that would give support to counties to buy voting equipment.  So they no longer would have those punch card voting machines.  But that's just a part of it.  That's the fig leaf of phase one.  But until they get to the place, they do some voter education, and they take some responsibilities in each county, to be sure that everyone who wants to vote will get a chance or the fact that if they made a false vote the first time, that they can correct it.  I mean that's--you couldn't--if you marked it wrong or those chads were--or they were dimpled or they were floating or whatever, and you wanted to correct it, you could not.  Because no one wanted you to get a chance to correct it.  And it's just, it's just been something that's--it's something that has caused me a lot of trauma because I know how hard it was for us to get a chance to vote.  And when we did, it was so flawed and so many irregularities, excusable irregularities which have now been documented by research as being not fair.  But it did happen.  So because it was an irregularity, we're supposed to move on and forget it.  That's what we were told here in the [U.S.] Congress, to move on.
Speaker 2: So what do you think was for blacks in the political system?  You know, because to hear this sort of, you know, what you say, you think God, we haven't come very far.  If we're still losing elections because of a, you know, of voting box irreg-- I'm, you know, because you--the perception is that we're apathetic out there.  You know.  And black people--.
Speaker 1: But we're not.  We had a sixteen percent increase in the voters in Florida.  Sixteen percent more than the last time in Dade County and in Florida.  That's a big increase.  There were people who voted this time who never voted before.  And that was a big frustration. They were not ready to deal with first-time voters.  Particular first time voters in black precincts.  They were not prepared.  They didn't try to get prepared.  They did--the people they hired to work on the polls couldn't help you any more than if you were a first-time person on the polls.  So to me, they keep saying, "There were irregularities."  Of course, you begin to see after so many irregularities--research teaches you that it's by design.  Something that's repeated over and over again.  So this last election just pulled the cloak off them.  They've probably been doing this all the time.  Cheating the black vote.  Cheating black people out of the vote.  But now they aren't gonna get away with that again.  No matter what they have done or what they happen to do.  It will not happen again.  We are assured of that.  We're gonna have our own poll watchers.  We're gonna have our own people teaching voter education, more so.  And we don't need the government to force us to do it.  I mean we take pride in our own vote.  And government should do it.  I mean there should be some reparation for what we lost the last time.  There really should.  But the reparation now is our gettin' the vote out again.  We're gonna come out again and we gonna do it this time.  And we're not promising anybody where it'll go.  But it'll go to people that push for our causes.  And they don't all have to be black.  As long as they have our concerns in mind, we will push them.

Speaker 1: You're seventy-five years old.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What do you want to still accomplish, you know, in your life?  What do you want to do that you haven't done?
Speaker 2: Well I still wanna be able to help people.  I wanna help cities help poor people.  I mean I still want more people to get houses.  We'll never have enough.  I still want more black people to get an education.  That's our biggest need.  I still want the testing to be equal and not to be in such a way that our kids are failing it.  I want our schools to be the best.  And the only way they're gonna be the best, is we invest more money in them.  We've got to bring them up to a point that we don't take money out of these black public schools and put it in a private school.  And say, we gonna give a voucher to a private school, who ten years ago kept our kids out.  They wouldn't let them in.  Now because there's money to be offered by the government, they let our kids in.  So, I still wanna see our schools get to be the best.  I don't want our kids to be turned around when it's time to graduate from high school.  'Cause they can't pass a basic test.  I want the school system to be so good that they can pass those tests.  I came out of an inferior school system and I passed them.  And I want even better for the ones who are coming out.  And that's my charge.  It really is.
Speaker 1: Now what do you in turn--just two more questions.  I want to ask two more questions--well, three.  One, the [U.S. Congressional] Black Caucus, the importance of the Black Caucus 'cause it's been--it has been stretched since--.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: The Black Caucus has reached new prominence in my opinion.  We've been able to focus on some very, very deep-seated problems in this country.  And I'll recall a few for you.  One had to do with giving the black farmers status when they tried for so many years to borrow money from the federal government, they were turned down.  They were not allowed to have loans.  They tried to make it equal for historically black colleges and universities.  They are way behind in the research portion of education.  I mean they don't have the big research institutions that they should have.  A lot of the clinical studies that are done in medical schools, are not done on African Americans 'cause they don't know how to do them.  And they don't know how to choose 'em.  And the research is not being conducted.  The great scourge AIDS [acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome], I wanna see that killed.  I wanna see that defeated.  And it can be.  If we put as much money in the AIDS battle that we're putting in some other things, we would overcome that great pandemic.  That can be done.  And I'd like to be here to do that.  And, of course, even if I retire, I will still be working.  I'm not gonna give up.  I'm hoping that my son [Kendrick Meek] will come and take my place and carry on.  So that's the way I feel.  There's so much to be done in those areas.  So never would I say, "Oh, I can stop and leave the Congress and things will stop." No, they have to continue.  And that's what I plan to do.

Speaker 1: Speaking of legacy, Miss Mandy, do you think if she had seen you, you know, or could see you now, what do you think she would say?
Speaker 2: She would say, "What hath God wrought?"  That's the same thing Mary McLeod Bethune used to say.  When she saw changes in us.  That's what Miss Mandy would say.  She would not--she knew it was coming.  But she didn't know when it would happen.
Speaker 1: And your mother [Carrie Pittman], she saw some of your--did she see--she saw--?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did she--was she alive to see your election?
Speaker 2: Well yes.  My mother was alive when I went into the state legislature.  She was alive.  She died just as I got in.  And she died--my mother died when Kendrick was a year old, my son.  So she wasn't there when I was sworn in.  She wasn't there, she died.  I went into--to the legislature in 1979.  And my mother died in '66 [1966].  So she didn't get to see me go into the legislature.  She saw me get to be a college teacher and she saw me achieve in that regard.  And she saw me get a family, which she always wanted me to get.  So she was very proud of me.  She saved every little article that came out about me.  Little--just a little snippet, my mother would keep it.  Whether it was something I did in athletics or what.  Whatever I did, she was a very proud mother.  And I'm the same way.  I think I pattern myself after her.
Story_ID: 18756
Speaker 1: What do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: One is that--one that I strove so hard for my people to be better educated and to reach some of the goals that our forefathers wanted us to reach.  And that was to become a knowledgeable, serving people.  We've always served.  But now we are getting to be more knowledgeable, better educated.  And we can come into our own.  I'd like to see in my lifetime, an African American become a president of this country.  In--maybe it won't happen in my lifetime.  But from some of the things that I do, some black person will become president.  And it's not gonna be as long as we think it'll be.  So my whole aspiration now is being able to inspire other people.  To inspire other African Americans to stick to it like I did.  Even when you don't have every little thing you want.

But, that's our hero Nelson Mandela who has already received the Congressional Medal of Honor.  And I want to say to you that he truly deserved it.

Speaker 1: Now this is an early picture of me when I went to the Florida legislature.  I was quite a debater during that time because you could debate on the floor.  It's a little different from the [U.S.] Congress.  You don't really get in debate on the floor of the Congress and whenever I wanted a bad bill--I did more in killing bad bills that first one or two years that I was there then I did in the House [of Representatives] of offering new bills.  And I carried a little flag, which you see has the skull and crossbones on it and I'd try my best to kill bad bills.  One which bill was one that would've required Haitians to have an ID card and of course I knew that was unequal and I fought that bill and I killed it with my black flag.  And that's what that's all about.
