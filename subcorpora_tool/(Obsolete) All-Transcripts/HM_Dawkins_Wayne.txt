Speaker 2: New York, New York, Bellevue Hospital when it was a, you know a great municipal hospital.  And we lived--we lived on West 35th Street, my parents and I, that is.  A one room apartment that had to be subdivided with partitions, at least how my mother described it.  And at age one we moved to Brooklyn.  And for most people I tell them that I'm from Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I lived in Bedford-Stuyvesant.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98320
Speaker 1: I'm going to go ahead and ask you five, six People magazine questions.  And they're very simple, only require very, short simple answer.  What is your favorite food?

Speaker 1: Okay, and your favorite phrase or saying.
Speaker 2: Probably "the greatest gift you can give someone is the purity of your attention".
Speaker 1: That's a very good one, very good one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, got that from, from a seminarian.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now the--I'm gonna ask you to give the location, city, and address of, of where we--are we today, right now.
Speaker 2: Atlanta, Georgia.
Speaker 1: Okay, and today's date.
Speaker 2: August 4th, 2005.
Story_ID: 98321
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now I'm going to take you back to your family's earliest beginnings, before you were born.  And I'll go back on your mother's side and then I'll go back on your father's side.  How far back can you go in your family history on your mother's side?  First, first let's start by asking you to give, give me your mother's name.
Speaker 2: Iris Carmen McFarquhar, M-C-F-A-R-Q-U-H-A-R, Dawkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can we get your mom's birth place and, and place of birth and, and date of birth?
Speaker 2: September 27th, 1921, and it was in the Panama Canal Zone.  I believe it was--I'm thinking Balboa [Panama], but I'm, I, I just know she was born in the--she's a Zonian, she was born in the Canal Zone.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She, she told many colorful stories about that too.
Speaker 1: And how far back can you go on--in your mother's family?
Speaker 2: My maternal side?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the mater--maternal side.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  She described my great-grandmother, Granny, and her name--see I don't have it in front of me.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 2: But I think, I believe her maiden name was Reed.
Speaker 1: Can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: R-E-E-D.
Speaker 1: And if you can't get it all, don't, don't worry about it, you can get it to us later.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have it, I have it, I have, I have that in--probably have that all in the document.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.  And the--how much do you remember--did you know her, by the way?  Your great-grandmother.
Speaker 2: No, I, I just--I, I, I knew my, I knew my grandparent--my, my--I knew my maternal grandparents [Lulitta Eugenie Reed McFarquhar and Wilfred McFarquhar].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they talk about your great-grandmother at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well funniest thing I remember was when my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] just kind of, just kind of said in passing when I was an adult that my great-grandmother's, you know my great-great-grandfather--my great-grandfather you know, he was in the Spanish American War and he had run off with a woman from Cuba.  But she kind of just said this in kind of a passing reference, you know I kind of yelled at her.  Like "Mom, you know where did this come from?"  Because she always told me like stories about the family, but I had--I had to hear this when I was in my, like in my, my 40s, and she just decided to share this with me.  The other thing she kept telling us that we had some kind of relationship--there was some kind of kin relationship to the Disney family.  And I never really pushed that because as a kid from Bed-Sty [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York] in the, in the '70s [1970s], I don't think I would score many points bragging I was related to Disney.  That that wouldn't score me many points on--in the hood.  So I, I kind of like was consciously deaf about that, but it's probably true.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know but she kept--and I didn't try to hit up Walt Disney Corporation for any residuals or anything.
Speaker 1: The--are there any other interesting stories that we should--
Speaker 2: About my maternal side?
Speaker 1: On the maternal side, great-grandmother.  If not, you know we can move--
Speaker 2: Let's see, you know she's--like I said she lived, she, she lived a fairly long life.  She lived until her late 70s, but she had an oversized heart.  So for many years she was ill.  So it may contribute to somewhat to me becoming a journalist because my mother encouraged us to write to our grandmother as a kind of therapy when I was a child.  So I had a writing habit as a boy of sending airmail letters to Panama from, from Brooklyn.  And I'd write my grandmother regularly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that must--you know that had to contribute somewhat to what I eventually did for a living.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98322
Speaker 1: Now your grandmother on your mother's side [Lulitta Eugenie Reed McFarquhar], did you know her, or did you know--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, I visit-- Yeah I visited her three times.
Speaker 1: Okay, what was her name?
Speaker 2: Lolita.
Speaker 1: L-O-L-I-T-A.
Speaker 2: It's L-U, L, L-U-L-E-I-T, I'd have to, I'd have to get the right spelling.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I have--and, and I made sure I'll write all that down [L-U-L-I-T-T-A].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the maiden name.
Speaker 1: And if you can't remember it now, you can fill it in later.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, but she was the grandmother.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the maternal grandmother, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, maternal grandmother.  Okay.  And she lived in Panama or did she live--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She lived in Panama.
Speaker 1: Any stories your mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] used to tell you about her or that you know personally?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was, she could be pretty strict.  For one thing, she was a big woman, which is probably where I got the height from.  And I mean just very tall and solid, you know not stout, but you know big boned.  And towered over her husband [Wilfred McFarquhar].  Her husband was the opposite, short.  She was kind of a child bride, married my grandfather as a teenager.
Speaker 1: Do you know how old she was when she--
Speaker 2: Believe, believe she was 76.  She died in 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay, and I was gonna say when, when they got married.  And if you--
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know if I, if I recorded that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, I, I may have that in the notes.  I may have been able to get that because I, I think there was something my aunt sent and I was able to get those details from my aunt and put it in the document.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was kind of one of those fortuitous things.  My mother tells the story about one time sassing my grandmother and she threw a scissors across the room and it caught her in the leg and that kind of an example of discipline back in those days.  Or the time--this was my mother, she was bit by a scorpion and her mother killed the scorpion and used the fat from the, you know, from that creature to salve the wound.
Story_ID: 98323
Speaker 1: Okay.  So your, your grandmother [Lulitta Eugenie Reed McFarquhar] had quite a, quite a temper.
Speaker 2: Well, well I, I just think that was probably old, old school discipline.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean there, there was a lot of--I sense a lot of love too.  She was athletic, she played tennis.  She was very involved in kind of like civic and social organizations.  And I, I saw some scrapbook pictures that was evidence of that.  I suspect this is something that's strongly attributed to my grandmother.  It's probably both grandparents, but my mother always told that story about in the Zone, in the, in the [Panama] Canal Zone, a lot of the military people who, who settled from the, from the, from the mainland, U.S. [United States] mainland, were white southerners.  And they tried to institute a system of currency where the, the whites in the Zone would use gold coins and the, the blacks and other indigenous people would use silver.  And she told me about how my grandparents fought ferociously against that, you know their attitude was you take that be--you take that mess back to the United States.  We don't do that here.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: We're, we're more in control of our, you know, our lives.
Speaker 1: So they were sort of stand-up people, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know my, my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] in her, in her own way is a, is a race woman.  And in a sense that, you know she kind of in her own way told us, you know, we had to be proud of who we are.  You know respect other people, but, you know, don't ever let anyone you know, tell you you're less than what you are.  And I think she must have gotten that from her mother.  I can, I can sense that probably my grandmother was really strong on that kind of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  One of the things I did forget, and I wanted to just find out and I know you did put it in the questionnaire.  A lot of these questions I'm asking you are in the questionnaire.  But the, the occupation for your great-grandmother and your great-grandfather on your mother's side.
Speaker 2: That, I don't know.  I'm a bit fuzzy on that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know that's--usually I'm better from the grandparents on back.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Let's go to then your grandmother, Lulitta, and her occupation.
Speaker 2: I, I was told she was a schoolteacher.  Schoolteacher and, you know, back then it was traditional women was a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Right.  And she was, she was married to--
Speaker 2: She was married to Wilfred McFarquhar.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And what, what was--well McFarquhar's occupation?
Speaker 2: Versions I've heard, also a teacher.  But also he--I'm pretty sure that he was--what he was not.  He was not an ordained minister, but he--
Speaker 1: Practicing minister.
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah and he was, he was--they, they were--my family was--on my mother's side was Methodist.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: So there was a lot of kind of teaching and preaching going on.  I don't know if it was necessarily credentialed like we know it today, but that's, that's what I remember my mother describing a lot of.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And again, birth dates and, and dates of birth are recorded in the questionnaire.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So we do--but if you remember it, could you give us that?
Speaker 2: Well like, like I was telling the gentleman here, we learned after the fact that my grandfather was 100 years old.  Someone misread his handwritten birth certificate from Jamaica, and he died sometime in the '90s [1990s, sic, 1987] and I recorded the year because that, that year is not as memorable as my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we, but we, but we do have it.
Speaker 1: Right, we, we do have that information.  So that's, that's good.
Story_ID: 98324
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other stories about your grandfather [Wilfred McFarquhar] or grandmother [Lulitta Eugenie Reed McFarquhar]?
Speaker 2: Thing I remember about my grandfather, now he's the opposite, so short that when he drove a car, he had to have a, a special seat to kind of prop him a little bit.  And I describe him as--if you saw him, you would call him a, a sepia toned James Cagney.  He even sounded like him.  I'm thinking of some--like I'm thinking like some of the scenes in "Mr. Roberts".  He even sounded like Cagney.  When he visited, and this may have been his first visit to the states in '75 [1975] or '76 [1976], and it's in one of the photos there.  I was tasked with--'75 [1975], summer of '75 [1975].  I was tasked with escorting him down to Florida to see my uncle, his, his son of course, his oldest son.  And he had, you know his, his vision was starting to go in one eye.  We were in downtown Brooklyn [New York City, New York] one time.  To show he kind of like still had it, he was winking at the mannequins in the window at (unclear).  He didn't realize they were mannequins.  I guess he feels--thought he was still a player.
Speaker 1: Latin lover.
Speaker 2: I know he, he loved, he loved the Dodgers.  Because my first visit to Panama in '69 [1969], I remember that was year when the, the [New York] Mets rallied and won the pennant.  And I, I say that because as a, a child from Brooklyn, black children did not have a choice in the matter with baseball.  You either had to become--you know became Mets fans because the Mets were created from the Dodgers and Giants, you know after they left New York.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you could not become a Yankee's fan from kids in my generation, or you'd be kicked out the family.  You had to be either with the [Brooklyn] Dodgers because of Jackie Robinson, all those players, or the [New York] Giants because of Willie Mays.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you know it was just a--and I remember he listened to the Dodgers games on the Armed Forces radio, you know in Panama.  So those are the kinds of things I remember about him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The--but he, he lived the majority of his life in the Panama Zone.
Speaker 2: Right.  He was one of--he was born in Jamaica, and the tip off there is that the Canal Zone was built by Caribbean laborers.  So first it was--and my aunt corrected me on this.  The first wave of labor were people from Barbados.  But after 20,000 people left the country, Barbados said we're not sending any more.  You know that--that's too much human capital.  So they started taking people from Jamaica.  So that's when my grandfather got over to Panama and he met my grandmother and married.  It worked the same way with my father [Edward Henry Dawkins].  He was college educated and I believe that an engineering background.  He came over to the Canal Zone and was smitten by my, my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] and here I am.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, okay.  The, the--many people are under the impression that almost all the people who lived in the Panama Canal Zone spoke Spanish as their first language.  But of course the immigrants coming in as workers, it was a little bit different.  Did your grandfather speak Jamaican and, and Spanish, your--was--
Speaker 2: They were--because they lived there, they were all fluent in Spanish.  But that's a good point because my mother for instance, is fluent, but she had to consciously go to school and learn Spanish because people speak both languages.  If you're in the Zone, you're really English speaking.  You only speak--you speak Spanish as your second language because you know the indigenous people, that's their language.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But my mother had to go and learn Spanish and she became fluent because she lived there.  Same thing with my father, my father--he, he spoke Spanish pretty well too.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they, you know they had to learn it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It wasn't their--
Speaker 1: Their first language remained--
Speaker 2: In the Canal Zone it wasn't the, it wasn't the--English was the first language.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Story_ID: 98325
Speaker 1: Now you are a young man and you were about to tell us about this trip to Florida.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I, and, and what I did, I--that was my first time going to Florida.  I, I just escorted him there 'cause I, you know, he [Wilfred McFarquhar] just needed some assistance.
Speaker 1: Right, because of his sight.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and any other stories that you might--your mother may have told you or you may have witnessed yourself.
Speaker 2: About, about my grandfather?
Speaker 1: Either one of your grandparents [Lulitta Eugenie Reed McFarquhar and Wilfred McFarquhar].
Speaker 2: Well I know he was very involved in his--in, in the, the church, the Methodist church since my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] grew up Methodist.  That was actually the main things I remembered.  You know I had a chance to observe them, you know, you know and spend a couple, you know summers. I made three visits to Panama when I was--before my 14th birthday, when I was 15, and my last visit was just before I started college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I, and, and then by that time, when you became--when you, when you reached retirement age, you had to leave the Zone.  So they lived in Panama City, then a suburb of Panama City.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was--it was just interesting just observing them.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: You know how they went through their routines and everything.
Speaker 1: Now the--your grandparents, how, how many children did they have, (unclear) name them?
Speaker 2: They had four, four, let me see, yeah, two, two daughters.  No I'm sorry, five children.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Three sons, two daughters.  There's my, my Uncle Hector who is the oldest son, and I'll do the, the sons first.  Hector, Uncle Fred, Fred McFarquhar who as a child I learned was a journalist.  He worked, he worked for the English language newspaper in, in Panama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So and I, I knew that there was--I had an uncle who was in the, in that field.  And then the youngest is Lloyd Handel McFarquhar.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How, how do you spell that middle name?
Speaker 2: Handel, Hand--like Handel's Messiah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: H-A-N-D-E-L, and it just happens he, he sings in his church choir.  So it's, it's a--he's right out of a central casting.
Speaker 1: And the two girls?
Speaker 2: The two daughters would be my mother was the oldest daughter, and then the youngest daughter was Mabel McFarquhar, who is a ordained minister.
Speaker 1: Oh okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Either Anglican or Episcopalian.  But she's the Reverend McFarquhar.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98326
Speaker 1: And now your, your mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins]--tell us a, a little bit about your mother, Iris, who was the oldest daughter.  And she was born in 1921.  What are your earliest memories?  What she has told you or of, of her?
Speaker 2: Her growing up?
Speaker 1: Her growing up.
Speaker 2: Let's see.  Well she, she had an eighth grade education.  But probably an eighth grade education then would be like graduating high school now.  She, she was literate and you know, could do arithmetic well.  She had--she was a very fairly curious person, so you know, you know you wouldn't consider her like a, like a, a intellectual.  She had just the kind of a basic working knowledge of things and was curious and was--
Speaker 1: Now she was born in Panama [Canal] Zone.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what, what, what was life like, like for her there as a child?  Do you, do you know, are there any stories she's told you?
Speaker 2: She told a story once of an earthquake where she felt she was about to get swallowed by the, you know by the, by the ground, literally.  Seeing what looked like a, a beautiful necklace on the street and it turned out it was a coral snake and she had to get, yeah get away from there.  There was some kind of epidemic, it was the typhoid or malaria, which she said affected her in the way that she, she lost a lot of her hair.  I mean she had beautiful jet black hair, but she said that when she was young, I mean she had like--she probably looked like one of the native Indians.  She had hair probably coming down her back.  But she lost of it then as a child.  Those are some of the main things.  She went to--she wanted to go to school for nursing, but that was a time when parents had to make gen--make decisions about who would get formal education.  And she was kind of as the oldest daughter, given the task to kind of take care of her mother [Lulitta Eugenie Reed McFarquhar].  Since, you know like I said, my grandmother had that oversized heart and needed kind of a little extra care.  She was a little--I could sense that she was somewhat embittered about that.  But she was like the good, dutiful daughter.  So her siblings all were, were all college educated.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So there was that.  And then--
Speaker 1: We hear that a lot about that generation.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean that was, that was kind of the reality.  You had to make, make--and you know families were bigger.  You know like there was five of them, but I think there was one child who died in a miscarriage or something.  You know so--but it was that kind of a, a typical family.  She--I'm trying to remember what, you know by the time she was a young adult, World War II had broken out.  So she probably was involved in civic things 'cause you know the--that Canal Zone was strategically important to move, to move warships, to move freight.  So it was a, like a buzz of activity in the '40s [1940s] when she was in her early 20s.  And then you know by the early '50s [1950s], that's when--well let's see.  She married my father in '52 [1952], but she was, she was married previously to a--married a doctor and they had a son who's now my half-brother, Ray--Raymond Phipps.  But that marriage, you know dissolved after a few years.
Story_ID: 98327
Speaker 1: Okay.  You, you had mentioned earlier about your mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] having been bitten by a scorpion.  Can you give us a few more details about that.  I mean it's not often and I know in that area they have some very deadly scorpions.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well when she, when she described it, it sounded pretty, it sounded pretty scary and dramatic.  But it also sounded like the family knew how to deal with this.  'Cause I mean if--you know this idea of killing the, killing the creature and then using the fat to kind of salve the wound.  I guess they had some experience in that area.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: So when I visited, I made sure and look, look around and know what's, know what's around me.  Because I mean Panama is semi-tropical.  Like one of the first creatures I'd ever seen was an iguana on the side of the road.  You see this, this kind of fierce looking creature and it kind of had this look, sort of like "I won't bother you if you don't bother me."
Speaker 1: And yeah they are fierce looking.  The, the, the growing up though, are there any other memories that your mother may have related to you?
Speaker 2: Of her growing up?  Let's see.  I mean there's all kinds of anecdotal stories that come to mind.  She described her, her brother Fred had this problem with sleepwalking.  One time he was sleepwalking on the roof of the house.  He had--I guess he got over that later.  But he--and, and, and plus he was also someone that just had to--seem to have just incredible bad luck with you know, falls and injuries and everything.  But I think those terrible years, those terrible years are behind him.
Speaker 1: But your mother remembers those-
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 99670
Speaker 1: Wanted to be sure that we had gotten most of your, your mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] coming to the states.  She married in--
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-two [1952].
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty--
Speaker 2: Yeah '52' [1952] in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She got married in Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she married, she met my father [Edward Henry Dawkins] and married, and married him in Jamaica.  And then they, then they--she said you know I, I interviewed her briefly years ago and I said well "Why did you, why did you come, come here?"  And she said that they were going through a, a really bad economic downturn and they, they saw opportunity here in America.  So--and they were helped by--this is the godfather I never met.  There was a, a, a white Canadian named Malone.  And he kind of helped pave the way.  So my other came over as--I guess what they call them now, they call them an au pair.  I mean she was--she took care of some child--she was in the live-in help for a--probably a very well-heeled doctor in Connecticut.  And then my father found work as a, as a hospital worker at Bellevue [Medical Center in New York City, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 99671
Speaker 1: Let's, let's--your mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] growing up in the Panama Canal Zone, and let's make that transition to Jamaica.  Because obviously there was a time when she left the Canal Zone.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You know what prompted her to, to leave, to go to Jamaica?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know exactly, but it may--it had something to do with meeting her first husband.  Because the thing is, the thing is with Panama and Jamaica, there is a lot of traveling back and forth.  You know Panama could easily be an island of the Caribbean because there, there's just that much intermingling between Jamaicans and Panamanians, and constant shuttling back and forth.  So it could be for ever--for, for, for any reason.  And plus, you know my, my maternal grandfather [Wilfred McFarquhar] you know, was born in Jamaica.  But you know moved to Panama for work and then married and raised a family.  So there's just this commuting back and forth between the two places.  I don't--I didn't quite make the connection on how my mother--
Speaker 1: What prompted it.
Speaker 2: What got my mother to Jamaica.  I would be speculating right now.  I never quite connected the two, but I know that she had to be in Jamaica 'cause that's where she was with her first husband.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then she met my dad [Edward Henry Dawkins].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She remarried.
Speaker 1: Now the--do you know approximately what age she was when she may have moved to Jamaica.
Speaker 2: Jamaica.  Let's see, that probably was the late '40s [1940s], so that would make her like mid, mid to late 20's probably.  She was probably like 25, 26 or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause let's see, my, my older brother is--he's about five or six.  He's about--I have Raymond's [Raymond Phipps]--see I could--we could do the math with Raymond's date of birth and then that would, that would place her in--that would place her in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I'd say she's probably around mid-20s or so.
Speaker 1: Okay, good en--good enough.  And that's, that's where she, she met Raymond's dad.
Speaker 2: Dad, Phipps.
Speaker 1: Right, Raymond Phipps, Senior I guess.  Was--
Speaker 2: His name wasn't--his name was not--I don't--his name was not Raymond.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I remember you know from what I was told, it was a--course it was a short and difficult marriage.  And then my, you know my, my older brother from that, that previous marriage, had a very--has had a very tortured life in that his father would never kind of deal with him.  I mean it was--he, he wasn't born out of wedlock or anything, or anything, but the father refused to have anything to do with him.  And that was a--kind of a very--you know it, it created a lot of family tension because it just made him feel more unwanted.  And then you know in my case, I'm in that situation where in the second marriage, I've always been raised as like the oldest son.  You know and I kind of--and you know I can, I can say that probably I carry myself like an oldest son.  In some ways the oldest sibling tens to kind of feel more privileged or, or, or--
Speaker 1: Right, and assumes more.
Speaker 2: Or you assume more responsibility too.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I mean the parents are usually counting on you, so you have to do the other things for the other siblings.  So I kind of have that personality, and I know that's caused some strain 'cause there is a brother who's older than me, but he wasn't--he's always felt kind of like an outsider.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I kind of have given you a circular answer.  But he just had a difficult kind of--
Speaker 1: No, no, that's very helpful.
Speaker 2: Situ--situation with his father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But when your mother remarried, he, he, he lived with the family.
Speaker 2: Well what he did, he, he lived in Jamaica and was raised by my mother's side of the family.  So kind of like he's very close to some of my uncles because they--uncles and, and, and my aunt because they kind of took care of him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he lived--he was kind of a beachcomber living in Jamaica.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he moved, he came to the states in '63 [1963] at age 16 or so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then he lived with us briefly in Brooklyn and then after, less than a year he moved out and lived on his own.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The--let's get the name of your, your mother's first husband that, that she married.
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know his first name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I just know, you know of course he was Phipps and he was a, he was either an MD [Medical Doctor] or he was maybe something, you know, below that.  But he was, he was in, he was in the health and-- or medical field.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 99672
Speaker 1: And your, your, your--that would not be your, your stepfather, that'd be your father, but are the, the man that your mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] married the second time.  Do you have that name?
Speaker 2: You mean my father.
Speaker 1: Yeah, your father.
Speaker 2: Yeah, of course, ready for his name?  Edward Henry Dawkins.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And because of the Henry, Edward Henry, his nickname was "King."
Speaker 1: King, okay.  Okay.  Okay, and now what, what are your earliest memories, let's go over to your father's side now.  Edward Henry Dawkins, "King."  Would--how far back can you trace your paternal parents?
Speaker 2: Well they're the grandparents who I, you know I heard about.  But did not meet because they had, they had died and so I didn't get a chance to meet them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have the right there--their, their names are on the document.  You know--
Speaker 1: Questionnaire.
Speaker 2: Yeah, on the questionnaire because they're a little, they're a little fuz--fuzzier.  My grandfather [George D. Dawkins] had the nickname "Teacher Dawkins" because he was, he was a headmaster of a school.  And then there was you know my maternal [sic, paternal] grandmother [Urah Jolivet Mundle Dawkins] who had an unusual name.  I believe it was--her maiden name was like Mundle.  But I, you know, I, I made sure and write that, I carefully wrote that all down.
Speaker 1: Right, right and we do--we do have it.  We like to, you know, just get it on tape.
Speaker 2: Yeah sure, sure.
Speaker 1: Whenever possible on there.
Speaker 2: And it just happens I have a cousin who settled here in Stone Mountain [Georgia], Olive, Olive Wheatley Dawkins, who kind of filled me in on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, Olive Wheatley.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Good Caribbean name.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then two years ago I was introduced to a cousin who was a retired Army lieutenant colonel who has this thing for genealogy and he's the person who was able to trace the family, the Dawkins side back to Thomas Dawkins in Jamaica in 1826.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was Thomas Dawkins.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that, that goes, that goes back a handful of generations.  But--and this, this cousin, his name is Hiram Johnson.  So that's where you get the, the branch of the Dawkins family that Dawkinses who married Johnsons from Tennessee.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then created this whole other branch.
Speaker 1: Okay that, that, that's going to be interesting.  We need to visit that, Hiram Johnson and so forth.  Let's talk about though, Thomas Dawkins.  What are some--
Speaker 2: I know very little 'cause I, you know that's just a, that's the, that's the end of the line in 1826.  I can, you know, what I can speak for is okay my, my father's--I've heard things about my father's parents.  After that, I'm, you know, I don't know much more.  You know like Dad was--the grandfather was a, a school headmaster.  My paternal grandmother seemed more like a--kind of like more of a, a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Homemaker, homemaker type.  And then they had all boys, they had four sons.  So that would be my father, the oldest was George, George Dawkins, then my father, and then there was Lass and the fourth was--I'm getting fuzzy on the name.  I think it was with an L.  But I, I, I have, I have it all in there.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.
Speaker 2: And there's only one, only one son survives now because my father died in December 2003.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There's only one survivor.
Story_ID: 99673
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay we are on your paternal--your father's [Edward Henry Dawkins] side, family.  And which began back with Thomas Dawkins in 1826 and we're sort of coming up to the present.  And your earliest memories are what you have been able to locate about anyone emanating from the Thomas Dawkins that you can tell us about.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I heard stories about how my paternal grandfather [George D. Dawkins] was much beloved headmaster.  And it sound like the family valued education.  My father went to what was an elite prep school called Cal--it was called Calabar College [sic, Calabar High School in Kingston, Jamaica].  And it turns I found out just, just recently that his classmate was my mother's [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] brother, Hector McFarquhar, so they went to, they went to the same school together.  This is the kind of school that prepared students to go to Oxford [University of Oxford in Oxford, England] and Cambridge [University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England] and, and other places.  And it was kind of the context my uncle gave me for an essay I wrote for a, a book called "Hey Daddy, Read This".  And he was trying to explain how my father struggled here in this country.  And my father worked all kinds of different jobs, but he probably never worked at anything that, you know, matched his natural qualifications.  And it was probably, you know probably some of it was--a lot of it was probably racism.  But you know the thing about my father was he had this kind of regal bearing about him.  I mean his nickname was "King" and he, he never seemed to show that he was getting beaten down this way.  But you know he had--you know my father was a flawed man too.  But it kind of helped me understand better probably what he was trying to, to do or just probably why he was the way he was.  But I mean he went to this--he, he probably should have been doing much more in this country and it probably was, you know, a great frustration to him.  But he, he did whatever he could to provide for his family.
Speaker 1: All right.  Your, your grandfather.  Let's, let's get into him as--draw him out.  He, he was a schoolmaster, and how--do you know how he decided he wanted to follow that career field, or what growing up for him was like?
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That, that's where it gets kind of sketchy.  I don't know much about what got him to that place, but kind of something I, I appreciated about the Caribbean.  And you know this, this came across when I was on my, my hon--watching a film during my honeymoon in 1982.  And you'd see these societies that--you know where they were, you know black societies and you saw people in the civil service, in the, in law enforcement and it was unlike say in the U.S. at that time.  'Cause you look--I was looking at this film from the 1930s or so.  And you know that America and the American South particularly, did not look anything like this.  I mean so you know, the other thing, the other thing that, you know, one of my uncles would caution me about in the Caribbean.  It was a caste system.  So there were these layers of people who were only allowed to do certain things.  So he, he'd always caution that.  You gotta understand it's not exactly like conditions in the U.S.
Speaker 1: Right. Right.
Story_ID: 99674
Speaker 1: Now when you speak of the Caribbean, going back to the Caribbean, are you speaking of going back to Jamaica, or are you speaking of going back to the American zone [Panama Canal Zone] where there are many Barbadians and--
Speaker 2: Probably more Jamaica than, than Panama.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Although that, I think, I think a lot of that probably transferred over to Panama too.  Although you have--since it's an American canal zone, there's probably some different dynamics.  But in Jamaica it was clearly, it was clearly a caste and to be blunt or crass about it, I mean it was, it was color coded too.  There were these kind of things, you know light skin people versus dark skin and so--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know sometimes people don't wanna talk about that, but it was kind of--
Speaker 1: It was there.
Speaker 2: It was, it was there.  And
Speaker 1: I, I, I agree.
Story_ID: 99675
Speaker 1: Let's now go to, to your father [Edward Henry Dawkins] more.  And you saw him as a young man growing up.  Give us a, a good, full picture of, of your dad.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I would say I got the best of, I got the best of my father, you know, among my siblings 'cause I spent the most time with him.  I know a lot of him rubbed off on me.  I'm hoping the, you know a lot of the good stuff.  He, he liked to move around and travel a lot and I used to hang, I used to tag along with him on errands and chores and we'd go all over the city, New York City [New York].
Speaker 1: Brooklyn.
Speaker 2: Brooklyn, Manhattan.  I mean we'd go--it, it, it kind of shows that when I, when I, when I go back home, I know every corner of the five boroughs in New York City and, and pretty much the suburbs because we used to run everywhere, whether it was on the train or when he had a car, we'd be in his car.  And either--I remember he was just so comfortable talking to people and to all kinds of people.  And he was incredibly charming.  Sometimes he was too charming for his own good.  He, he dressed well.
Speaker 1: You want to explain that, what that means?
Speaker 2: Well my, my father's fatal flaw was gambling.  And he--so he was charming in that sense.  But on the positive side, I'd say he was charming in that he just--I mean he's well-educated.  He, he knew stuff.  He could, he could engage you in conversation in just about anything, politics, sports, religion, current events.  I mean he, he dressed well.  He, he liked cigars, good cigars.  He--I was always amazed how occasionally he'd smoke a cigarette, but then he, he didn't seem addicted to the stuff.  He could like kind of take it or leave it.  He liked the good drink every now and then, but he didn't, he didn't overindulge.  He, he seemed to do--it was amazing that he seemed to do everything in moderation except for the gambling.  That was his, that was his Achilles heel, which would sometimes might put us in like perilous situations.  But everything else he seemed to do in, in moderation.  I mean you know at, at the end of his life, I mean he was a--someone who would get up and run and he was this six foot still athletic-looking eighty-three year old man.  You know when I, when I went to see him in upstate New York.  And still, you know, he was living in a rooming house, but in a, in a little room that was filled with books 'cause he still--there was still this curious mind working.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And he liked watching his sports on TV.  He was a--his sports was--he played cricket and he was a very good swimmer, which is probably the clue why all his, all his sons could swim.  But my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins], my mother was not a swimmer and was terrified because she had a bad accident once at the beach where she almost drowned.  So but we all became swimmers because our dad--
Speaker 1: Was a swimmer.
Speaker 2: Was a swimmer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: A very good one.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 99676
Speaker 1: Now you had an uncle [Fred McFarquhar] who was a journalist.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How much of an influence was he on your becoming a journalist?
Speaker 2: He was an influence because as a child I just knew that there, there was this uncle I had not met yet, who my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] said you know, worked with the Star and Herald newspaper in Panama.  So it was kind of a--he, he was--I just knew this person existed, he was a role model.  And I know I finally met him years later.  And then when I was--I think on my last visit to Panama, I, I went and I, I hung out for a while in the office in the newsroom.  And saw how these people went about their work.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that was, that was definitely an influence.  It's nice to--it was just, just to know that this is something I could aspire to.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Do you remember your earliest memories of wanting to become a journalist?
Speaker 2: Yes I do.  And I made the decision my sophomore in high school [New Utrecht High School in New York City, New York].  So that would have been 1970 or so.  But before that, you know one of the things that influenced me was seeing the front page of the New York Times and seeing this man named Earl Caldwell, who was caught up in that whole situation with the reporting on the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] and the Justice Department was leaning on him.  And he's standing up against them.  And that's when you know, I wanted to be that kind of heroic kind of stand up figure.  So I mean he immediately became a, a--like a, a hero of mine and a role model, you know.  So yeah, it was, it was Earl Caldwell that kind of did it for me.
Speaker 1: That lit that fire for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 99677
Speaker 1: We're going to go back a few years, your earliest years as a very, very young child.  What are your earliest memories there?
Speaker 2: My earliest memories are the--one of my first memories was like a, a dream about being on the sub--on, on a--in the subway and it was definitely our nearby train station, the Bedford-Nostrand station on the, the GG line, it's now known as the "G."  But it was the GG.  Charles Mingus even wrote a tune called the "GG Train".  And what helped with my memories was my mother was--my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] had this thing--my mother must have been a, a frustrated photojournalist because she had this thing about keeping family pictures.  So there are pictures of me, some are in that package, eating a popsicle when I was two years old and sitting on, on the stoop of--I have a memory of my glasses, eyeglasses getting broken because my mother figured out that I was nearsighted when I was eighteen months old.  So I've been wearing glasses since that age.  So there are a lot of goofy pictures of me, like one of me on a pony when I was three in Brooklyn [New York City, New York] of all places.
Speaker 1: And wearing the glasses.
Speaker 2: And wearing the glasses and a little beanie and the kind of like the beanie cap and the, and the knickers.  I look like somebody out of another ear.  I remember the, the reading--my parents [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins and Edward Henry Dawkins] just had the reading habit.  So they made sure we had a full set of encyclopedias.  I would see my parents reading the newspapers.  This created a, a like a, a dispute with my editor in New Jersey because I wrote a column once about the, the [New York] Daily News when they were going through this strike in 1990.  And I made a reference to the [New York] Journal-American newspaper in the six, in the early '60's [1960s].  And he said you, you can't be old enough to remember that.  And I said but, but I do because I used to read the funny pages, the Sunday funnies in the car while we were driving to church.  So I remember names like the, the [New York] Herald Tribune and the Journal-American.  You know I wasn't old enough to read it, you know like the news, but I, you know, I was a kid, I liked the comics.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I read that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and my--and you know my parents liked the, the funnies too.  So that was a way to get the kids involved.  I mean you know my mother liked Gasoline Ann Alley [sic, Gasoline Alley] and Brenda Starr [Brenda Starr, Reporter] and she would send me to the, the candy store to get the paper and she'd have--and she'd say don't get the night owl, get the final education 'cause I want the, the freshest news.  And she would just get it just to read--she wasn't reading anything like heavy news.  She may have wanted to keep following like something that was serialized in the paper.  But that was a, that was a habit, you know.  So--
Story_ID: 99678
Speaker 1: Do you remember where you lived?  You, you've told us the area there, but do you remember the address?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah I, I lived at--we lived--for 19 years we lived at 207 Kosciuszko Street.  And I, I, I know I'm butchering the pronunciation.  If I was Pole--if I were Polish, I'd say Cashusco (ph.).  But Brooklynites say Kosciusko.
Speaker 1: Right
Speaker 2: K-O-S-C-I-U-S-K-O [sic, K-O-S-C-I-U-S-Z-K-O].  And it was between--it was a three story, a three--a, a, three story apartment house.  There was bounded by Thomkins and Marcy Avenues.  We lived on a block that was--when I lived there, there was still a lot of Hasidic Jews who lived on the block, but it was mostly black and Puerto Rican.  And one corner, it was anchored by St. Ambrose Roman Catholic Convent.  And then at the other end of the block was--I know across the street there was a, like a, a corner store.  And the opposite corner there was a, a little A and P that was so small, it had--it sold everything except perishable food.  You know, can goods and you could buy bread and everything, but you couldn't buy meat or, or vegetables, which--or fruit, which meant we would have to go two blocks up to the DeKalb Market, which was an open air market where you could buy fresh fruit and vegetables and rice and dried beans were in sacks and there was a Jewish bakery and place that had mackerel in barrels and you know, you know the huge pickles and everything.  And I grew up not far from--maybe six blocks from where [Robert C.] Bob Maynard grew up.  So one time when Bob Maynard wrote about the DeKalb Market, I sent him a note and he, he wrote a, he wrote a lovely letter back.  Kind of like sharing that memory.  I also had to find out after the fact, that I grew up six, seven blocks from an icon, the [HM] Reverend Gardner Taylor, who was like, like one of [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s closest peers.  I remember just walking by that church [Concord Baptist Church of Christ] at Gates [sic, Madison] and Marcy Avenue just kind of routinely.  I didn't know who would have thunk that, you know, if you read any serious Civil Rights history, you're gonna see that Gardner Taylor was one of his, was one of his closest confidants.
Story_ID: 98337
Speaker 1: So, you know, we're trying to establish that, that era which you came up there in Brooklyn [New York City, New York] and what it was like, the sights and sounds of, of, of that, of that period.  Now what, what was it like?  I know all of these groups were living together, all these different cultures were, were blended together.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: And harmoniously in many parts of Brooklyn.  But were there some exceptions?
Speaker 2: I would say, I would say it was co-existing.  I think in New York it, it's traditionally been a, kind of an uneasy co-existence.  But you know what?  I like to tell people that I grew up in a situation that was multi-cultural before it became a buzzword in the '90s [1990s] and a, a word that people still kind of either try to understand or resist.  But that was the reality.  We lived--you know Brooklyn is basically twenty-two ethnic villages strung together into what will be the fourth largest city in America, would still be if they hadn't made that mistake in 1898.  So what I like to tell people at the very least--
Speaker 1: Explain that mistake for people.
Speaker 2: Well yeah in 1898 Brooklyn joined the consolidated into the City of New York.  It was like the, the different boroughs were all cities unto themselves, and it all became one big city in 1898, which is why there are still some Brooklynites who say they're going into the city when they go into Manhattan.  They still think of Brooklyn as a--kind of this outer, outer village.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Or just one big town rather than, you know, the, the city.
Speaker 1: And these different cultures, they're living under one tent.  They, they tend to--I, I find many blacks there in Brooklyn using a lot of Jewish words that they've incorporated into their language, or Italian words and so forth.
Speaker 2: Right.  You, you can't help but adopt you know some of the, the habits.  Like for instance my middle brother Keith is a career civil servant.  He's a New York City corrections officer.  He's been in the job twenty-something years.  If you listen to him, he now has that kind of Irish, Italian, American, Yiddish kind of dialect that kind of runs through the way he talks because he's in that--he works in that culture.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So you, you, you hear that, but the generation that's gonna succeed him is gonna have more of this Caribbean, Hispanic patois because that's the new--those are the new immigrants that have now established themselves.  So you know New York even has this evolving language.  But you know our generation was heavily influenced by you know these other groups that we lived around.  So you know every now and then I'll say something and I'll throw in a Yiddish word but because I, I lived around some char--you know, characters and that's how they, they talked.  So you--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you, you kind of--you know with Hasidic Jews being on the, the block for instance, we knew that on Saturday, Saturday was their Sabbath so we were very mindful of that, for instance, that you know you--we needed to be quiet and respect what they were doing.  I remember with Puerto Ricans who were largely Catholic, when I went to school on Wednesdays, a lot of them would get let out for religious instruction and they'd go to their convent, which is kind of very interesting in these days when you, you--we're, we're navigating issues of church and state and everything.  But it was almost this kind of acknowledgement that yeah there is a separation, but you know, you know but we do, we do respect and encourage religion in the public square.  So school used to let out the kids so they could go to, you know, the Catholic convent because you know that's where religion's practiced, but you know--
Speaker 1: Right.  And Jewish holidays were respected.
Speaker 2: Jewish holidays were respected so much so in that that's why New York schools start school in mid to late September because they wanted to accommodate the, the Jewish holidays because Yom Kip--Yom Kippur--see that's the other thing we learned.  That is, you know--that's when you get into the serious Jewish holidays.  Because you know Jewish people will tell you that Hanukkah and, Hanukkah, even Passover are not considered the major holidays in their culture.  You know we, we, consis--we conveniently lump it in with Christmas and Easter.  But they'll say you know, Yom Kip--Yom Kippur is the big one for us.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Story_ID: 98338
Speaker 1: The, the--tell us about your school life now.  Teachers that you may remember for any particular reason.
Speaker 2: Well first of all, I was, I was fortunate in that by the time I was ready for school, the neighborhood--they had just built a brand new elementary school.  And the name they gave it, great name, Benjamin Banneker Elementary [School] P.S. 256.  So I was going to a new school as a child.  One of my teachers--there was my kindergarten teacher, who my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] said kind of cautioned her to kind of--to go a little easier on me, you know with, with discipline because I, I think what happened was--what happened, I tend to be an awkward and clumsy child.  I would drop things.  I don't think it had anything to do so much with behavior.  But my mother could be very stern or tough with me.  So she asked you know, kind of just, just ease up a little bit.  I remember a Ms. Adams because she was the principal.  The way in which she stood out, you know this was still a time when it just seemed, you know, all the teachers were white.  But Ms. Adams was this tall black woman who was--who ran the school.  And that was kind of a, a memory.  And the other--I think probably what also kind of contributed to that, some of the images I remember, like in the assembly hall and everything.  You'd see pictures of people like the one, the one I remember particularly was Leontyne Price.  You know they would have pictures of you know black achievers.  And so we have this great opera singer on the wall, just to remind there of like the bigger things you can be.  And then Benjamin Banneker is a, is a, is a great figure I like to remember.  The thing I, I written about in Time was how he challenged Thomas Jefferson's idea of race because you know Jefferson actually had like kind of the classical racist view where he felt blacks were inferior.  And that's when Banneker wrote a letter to Jefferson calling him on that basically, and Jefferson didn't answer him directly, but he, he did acknowledge receiving the letter.  And so you know Bann-Banneker was this great achiever and it was great to go to a school like that.  So I went to P.S. 256.
Story_ID: 98339
Speaker 1: My childhood friends were all bused to another elementary school for the sixth grade because New York--here's where it gets a little complicated.  New York had just changed the system from junior high schools.  'Cause it used to be you'd go--elementary was K to six, and then junior high was seven and eighth, then you went to high school.  They changed it to the intermediate system where now the sixth grade was put into six, seven, eight system.  And I went to the neighborhood junior high--neighborhood intermediate school, which turned out to be a disaster because it was like--
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: Did incredible discipline problems.  Kids spent more time either fighting each other or just disrupting the class.  I was--I was just--my, my class work really plummeted.  I was just kind of--I was kind of the--
Speaker 2: What year are we talking about?
Speaker 1: This would have been 19--the 196--around 1966, yeah.  And my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] noticed that things were just not right.  Like for instance the, the obvious was when I ended up getting into a, a fight at school because some kids jumped in front of me on the lunch line and I ended up kind of like--all I remember was getting into kind of this flailing kind of fighting and ending up in the principal's office.  And that kind of stuff never happened.  So my mother decided I'm getting my son out of this school.  And she went down to the Board of Ed [Education] downtown, which is the equivalent of trying to, to crash through the Great Wall of China.  And she didn't leave until her son was put--was, was transferred and put on the--a school bus with his friends, and would spend a--the sixth grade at elementary school in the Bay Ridge Section of Brooklyn [New York City, New York].  So I ended up being bused to P.S. 176 [The Ovington School], and I was reunited with my, with my neighborhood friends.  And I--what I remember about 176--this was in a predominantly white area.  We were not particularly welcomed.  We were pretty much just tolerated.  But I was able to get back to the notion of schooling and getting an education.  And then from there, that fed into a junior high in Bensonhurst, [Edward B.] Shallow Junior High School [I.S. 227] where I spent the seventh and eighth grade.  What was significant about the eighth grade, was that was the year of the Ocean Hill-Brownsville confrontation [New York City teachers' strike of 1968].  So those were tense times.
Speaker 2: Rhody McCoy.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Those were tense times because okay that's the eighth grade, okay.  I get through the eighth grade and I go to high school.  So it was kind of a funny thing where as a thirteen year old, I was eager to get on with school.  I didn't wanna mess around and stay longer or have to spend part of my summer going to class.  So that was a tense two weeks until they worked that out.  So from junior high, I had to feed--I was able to feed into one of the high schools in that area.  I had two choices.  I could either go to Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Bensonhurst or the [New] Utrecht High School also in Bensonhurst.  I chose the Utrecht because I learned that I would have to walk through a graveyard each day to get to FDR, so I said no, I don't wanna do that.  So I ended up going to Utrecht, which is in Bensonhurst.  It's the, the school's the backdrop for the sitcom "Welcome Back Kotter".  School was also the backdrop for a chase scene on the movie the, the "French Connection".  It was a school of hard knocks.
Story_ID: 98340
Speaker 1: Now let, let me ask you.  Does this mean then that in high school [New Utrecht High School] you were no longer being bused there, you just had to catch a train?
Speaker 2: I took four subway trains.  It was an hour riding on four subway trains each day to get to high school.  And then the first two years of high school, I was on a split session schedule, which I meant in at ten and stayed until 4:30.  Because this was a high school that was built for 2,600 students, but they crammed 5,500 of us, yes, 5,500 of us in Bensonhurst where the people--the, the neighbors there was like 85 percent Italian, 80 percent Italian and American.  They were not thrilled with the, the Jews from Burrow Park or the blacks from Bedford Stuyvesant coming to their school.  So Chris Rock is doing this sitcom called "Everybody Hates Chris", and he's describing--he had, he had, he had a very similar experience.  So that's what I told people.  I said "my God, he's telling my life story".
Speaker 1: Because that, that seems--I didn't realize it was that hectic.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was, it was very hectic.  I remember when I was a junior, I, I was leaving school to go home and a kid walked up to me and he said "You got any change?"  And then he just punched me.  He punched me in the face.  It happened so fast that I didn't feel you know any pain, but I remember seeing stars.  And what happened was something had happened, I think some black kids had sold this guy some--stiffed him on like a, like a--some, some marijuana or something.  So he decided I'm gonna clobber the first black guy I see, and it was, it was me.
Speaker 1: It was you.
Speaker 2: And we used to joke that luckily the, the el--the elevated line was only a block away.  So if any trouble went down, we had to make like Olympic runners and get to the, get to the train.
Speaker 1: Why, why didn't the city provide the busing?  I mean they, they provided it--
Speaker 2: Because this was, this was--
Speaker 1: Through elementary and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, this was, this was New York City.  And by the time you're a junior high school student because by the time I was in junior high [Edward B. Shallow Junior High School, I.S. 227], I was riding the New York City subway system.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know New York kids are tough.  You know by the time you're early adolescents, you get bus or train passes and you learn how to ride the public buses and subways.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean that's still a sore point here at home because we have a daughter [Carmen J. Dawkins] who, you know my wife [Allie Crump Dawkins] resisted for years having her ride public transportation.  And she had good reasons.  I mean I was a boy, I lived in a different time.  And you know she wouldn't want her to ride public transit unless you know it was with a buddy or something.  But, but now I have--I deal with serious resistance.  She's--our daughter's about to turn 17 and she has no interest in riding pub--public transit of any kind.  So I just look at her sternly and I say I don't know what world you're growing up in, but you'd better learn how to use everything.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: But I, I rode--I, I learned to ride the buses and trains by myself at age nine or ten.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: You know and, and I--and that was for reasons of necessity being you know, being raised as the older boy, I had, I had to run errands for my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] or something.  I had to know how to get, how to get around.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  And probably had to escort your siblings in some instances.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Story_ID: 98341
Speaker 1: Okay.  What, what are some of the school experiences now with the various teachers?  You're in these outer neighborhood schools.  You're in the minority as a black student.  What are some of the experiences, both the troubling ones or the pleasant ones?
Speaker 2: I know on the pleasant side I, I endeared myself to some teachers that really took interest in my work.  I remember--well in elementary school [Benjamin Banneker Elementary School. P.S. 256] I remember a Ms. Carbo [ph.] who I kind of had a crush on.  You know I had one of those classic like ten year old schoolboy crushes on.  And I remember she took a few of us to Radio City Music Hall [New York City, New York].  That was the first time I ever went there to see--we saw a feature length movie and we saw the Rockettes.  And then she took us to dinner afterwards.  You know kind of things that teachers would do.  So that--
Speaker 1: Right.  How many, how many students was she taking?
Speaker 2: It was probably a handful of us.  It wasn't just me, but it was maybe three or, maybe three, four, maybe up to five of us.  And I mean she just, she just did that.  And I think we were teachers who--we were students that kind of stood out.  Either she or someone else said I had an aptitude for drawing and sketching.  And I was kind of pulled to the side and they wanted to see if I had any kind of really artistic talent.  And I, I'm still not bad free-handed, I can draw better than most.  But I think that kind of helped serve me well when I was an op-ed editor.  I have this thing for picking out editorial cartoons and also photography.  At Hampton [University in Hampton, Virginia] this year, Earl Caldwell in a rush wanted us to judge some categories and he gave me photography.  And I think he was kind of taken how I was very specific in what I thought made a good image or a good news photo.  What made a good visual.  And that kind of goes back to those days.  As far as other teachers in high school, I remember there was a geography teacher that took great interest me.  I tended in the humanity-like subjects, to do very well.  And I kind of like muddled along in more like the math and sciences.  On the high school [New Utrecht High School] paper someone named Beatrice Rosenbaum took a lot of interest in what I was doing and at that time, I remember I used to read--I used to get the New York Times cause they, they had the, the deal where the students could get it at a discount or get a special rate.  So I felt so mature in the mornings I would go into the teachers' mail room because my delivered copy of the New York Times would be waiting for me.  So I had this kind of, you know some of these students would razz me about this.  Like who do you, like who do you think you are?  I mean you know this 11th grader reading the, reading the New York Times.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But you know I--but she set, you know set that up for me.
Story_ID: 98342
Speaker 1: So you finally got through high school [New Utrecht High School].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I'll say this about high school.  Now I didn't have a whole lot of guidance as--I had to kind of figure this out for myself.  I mean Mrs. [Beatrice] Rosenbaum helped as much as she could, but the guidance counselors, I don't think they really knew what to do with me because you know the students who were the elites, you know, scholastically or athletically, were taken care of.  They went to, you know I knew some people who went to like Ivy League schools or top schools.  There was this whole other group that was gonna go and land somewhere in the city college system, but I wasn't one of them.  I wanted to major in journalism, but all the guidance knew about was they said well you're gonna have to go to Columbia University, Columbia College for four years, then go to graduate school.  They didn't know about undergraduate programs.  So I'm reading the [New York] Times, I saw that Long Island University [Brooklyn, New York] had this kind of program, so I applied and was accepted.  But I kind of did that by myself.  In doing that, I missed out probably on some grants and scholarships and stuff that was available.  But I think in a way it was a good experience because I had, you know, in the beginning, I paid my own way.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Until tuition got so high I was kind of in this tenuous position.  I had taken out some student loans, but then it got so high I couldn't even handle that.  But once I was in school and I knew how to kind of work as a, a student and get better grades, I was offered grants.  And it's funny how money can, can make you so much smarter.  Because when I saw that as long as I could maintain like a dean's list level GPA [grade point average], there was money waiting at the end of the line.  I became a much better student.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You know I went, I went from a student who paid attention to the subjects that interested him, to a student that was you know more earnest about--and the subjects that were not my strong subjects, I learned how to, you know, battle and those were back in the days where sometimes the best you could do was a C or a C plus.  But you--that was a well-earned C or C plus, that wasn't some inflated grade like the, the--one of the best lessons I learned in college was for a class that was killing me.  It was a, a sociology class called Communications.  But this kind of communications--this was like the technical stuff.  This was dealing with issues of like entropy  and--I mean this was a, this was a very technical communications course.  And--
Speaker 1: Was this 11th grade or the 12th grade?
Speaker 2: No this was, this was, this was college level course that I'm thinking of.  I'm probably jumping ahead a little bit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I remember the textbook was, was not in the college bookstore and professor said you know, you know that's not my problem.  You know, you're gonna have to get the book.  So that's when I looked up the publisher and I saw it was the University Press in Westchester, New York, and on a very cold morning, I got on the subway and I got on the--what's now the Metro-North Railroad, and I showed--I was like waiting at the door for them to open at nine so I could go and buy this textbook.  And I went and got back on the trains and went back to New York City.  But I knew that I wasn't gonna flunk this class.  And so I, I need this textbook and I'm gonna muddle through this class and do the best I can.  But failure was not an option for me.
Story_ID: 98343
Speaker 1: So in a lot of ways, around 11th grade, 12th, you started to see that if you were going to succeed, you were going to have to just do it yourself.  You couldn't depend on guidance counselors or, or others.
Speaker 2: Right.  I'll never pretend that I'm just a self-made man.  You know I'm made from a lot of people.  But I think the--probably the words that stuck in my head.  My mother's [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] a very spiritual person and she used to say often "God helps those who help themselves".  So you know often I kind of roll my eyes when, when people say they're gonna just leave things to, to God.  I like what Bill Cosby said recently when he said that a lot of us are putting too much pressure on God and Jesus to, to, to, to save us, we have to save ourselves.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And probably the, the creator will give us a, a guiding hand, but we gotta get out there and show that we're gonna do what we have--what, what we need to do.
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Story_ID: 98344
Speaker 1: Okay now you, you've decided that you can take your journalism courses at Long Island University [Brooklyn, New York].  And so you've applied, you've been admitted, you're paying your own tuition.  And you're working part time jobs?
Speaker 2: Yes, by my sophomore year I have a, I have a work-study job.  In the summers I, I work as a day camp counselor at the Boys' Club in my neighborhood.  So I'm, I'm--yeah, I'm doing those kinds of things, kind of a combination of both.  My freshman year, you know I concentrated on school.  But I also played JV [junior varsity] basketball, so that took up a lot of my time.  So that was, that was the year I probably had my lowest GPA.  I was like a 2.8 because I'm, I'm figuring out college.  I, I remember my, my first English composition class, you know I thought I was a pretty good writer until I got my clock cleaned in English composition and realized I didn't--I, I just made maybe at best a C plus.  And I just knew I had to improve my game.  But you know I say that those were back in the days, that was probably just before we had this epidemic of grade inflation.  So I mean even in--at a college level, back then a C or a C plus meant you had to battle.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You had to--and so when you got B's or A's in your classes, that meant you was very good to excellent.  So that was something to really strive for.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: So you know once I got past my freshman year and kind of got acclimated, from then I, I always stayed like right around 3.0.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then toward the--my last three semesters of college is when I was always above 3.25 and better.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: in my studies.  And then my, my minor was history.  And the most--hands down, the most influential professor I had at Long Island University was a history professor named Jack Dorinson [sic, Joseph Dorinson]--
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: --who was just--he was just wonderful.  I, I--he was my friend immediately after I took my, my first American history class under him and I went back and took a couple other courses, American social history and something else.  And then there was some other history professors who were in the--but they, they were more influential to me than my journalism professors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now Long Island University is made up of a number of colleges.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Which, which one were you at?
Speaker 2: I was at the main campus, the Brooklyn campus on Flatbush Avenue and DeKalb, which the athletic building was the old Brooklyn Paramount Theater.
Speaker 1: Oh. Okay.
Speaker 2: You know like there aren't any traces of it now, but when I was going there, the, the gym was in the old Brooklyn Paramount.  The offices were--one time the dressing rooms where all these like 1950s rock stars and rock and roll stars--the fans sat in these like velvet theater seats.  We had a balcony, a pipe organ.  You know the--when the varsity would play, someone would play the, the pipe organ.  I played in a JV basketball game one time when one of my teammates blocked somebody's shot and knocked it up in the balcony.  And then we had to delay the game five minutes to go find the ball.
Story_ID: 98345
Speaker 1: All right you're now in college [Long Island University in Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You've sort of learned the ropes and you know now that you have to apply yourself--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --if you're really going to succeed. You're in your second year and what, what, what is, what is it like?  You're beginning--your grades are coming up now.
Speaker 2: My grades are coming up and I see one--one way--there's another way in which I need to stay focused, okay.  You, you--I'm going to what's a pri--it's, it's a private college, although it may not feel that way.  It may feel like more like city college.  It's--we had so many students of color, black and Latino, that I know by my junior year, the school was receiving a certain kind of funding that was similar to what historical black colleges [HBCUs] was receiving.  I also noticed that in addition to keeping my grades up, it was important that I really figure out how to pay for college because I noticed that there were--there were some classmates who had to drop out.  And it didn't seem like it was for academic reasons, but it was just either family issues or responsibilities.  And I noticed that once they, they said "I'm gonna take a semester off," it was very hard for them to get back to school.  Or if they finished, they needed like seven years, six years.  And I was determined, I just felt it was a non-negotiable, that I was going to complete college in four years.  And I was proud of the fact that with, with my undergraduate years, I finished college in exactly four years.  I never took--I never needed any time for summer school, the summer, summer session.  So I always like having my summers off where I could either work and, and also play.  And also I kind of made this pact with myself, I didn't take any class--I had, I had a pass--I could take the class with pass/fail as an option.  But I decided I took every class for a grade, a letter grade, even the classes where I struggled.  But I just felt with the GPA, I wanted that to be solid; that I was gonna earn everything.  And there were, there were some classes where, you know I only--the best I could do was a C or a C plus, but you know overall, you know I--it was most A's and B's.  So I, I just kind of just felt that was the way I, I wanted to do things.
Story_ID: 98346
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were learning journalism and enjoying this history.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And by the time I--my junior year, a classmate who I, I didn't  know that well called me and told me about an opportunity in Long Island.  That there was a, a black fellow who was a copy editor at the Times, New York Times, and he had started a--he was starting a weekly.  He left the Times and started this weekly.  And he was looking for sports writers, or looking for writers.  And this was, this was Dave Porter, who was a year ahead of me at LIU [Long Island University in Brooklyn, New York] and was already working in the business on the side.  And he gave me--he gave that person my name.  So I--in my junior year, I would commute a few days to Long Island and help out.  And I, I really didn't know what I was doing, but I mean it was--but it was a chance to kind of like learn the newsroom experience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Dave and I became friends.  I mean this was--this was exactly the kind of stuff that Errol Cockfield was talking about yesterday when he gave his tribute and he said "Why are all these, these people I don't even know are just trying to help me?"  And it was like this, this case of you know why we all have this responsibility to, to come back and pull someone up because you never know whose watching you and who will just kind of like say I'm gonna offer you this opportunity.  So I did that my junior year.
Speaker 1: And what year, what was that?
Speaker 2: That would have been the seven, '75 [1975], '76 [1976] year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then for my senior year, by that time, by my senior year I was an associate editor of the school paper, which was called--it was named after an Indian tribe, Seawanhaka, and you know focusing on my classes.  So I graduate in 1977, June of 1977.  [HM] Vernon Jordan was our commencement speaker.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 98347
Speaker 1: And then by then that summer [1977], I've applied to probably at least a dozen daily newspapers, all up and down the East Coast.  But my handy--
Speaker 2: Were you still helping Dave Porter out also?
Speaker 1: No, I was--I did that pretty much that year before.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So--and that paper was short lived anyway.  By that summer, I'm applying to these different newspapers, but I have this handicap, I don't have my driver's license yet because I live in New York [New York City, New York] and really with all the public transportation, there isn't really a compelling reason to have a driver's license.  But if you wanna work at most daily newspapers out in the suburbs, you need a license.  So I'm working on that.  But in the meantime, one of my classmates, someone named Morris McCoy who graduated the year before, like David, says "Wayne, why don't you come downtown, downtown Brooklyn.  I want you to meet someone named Andy Cooper [Andrew W. Cooper], you know.  You don't have any kind of like serious work yet."  So I go to this little office on Joralemon Street in downtown Brooklyn and I meet Andy Cooper and his assistant, Etrice [ph.] Lee.  And I, you know it looks interesting.  I, I already know I have some part time work I'm doing at the Boys Club as a counselor.  So I agree to--Andy offers either kind of like "This is a start-up, do you wanna just volunteer, do some research, write some articles."  So I start doing that.  I start coming to the office and that summer.  And then by the fall, I learn that, you know Andy and Trice have gotten a grant for Trans-Urban News Service [TUNS], you know ostensibly the grant says it's for researchers.  But really it's to have like reporters and photographers to put out this news service.  So in January '78 [1978], you know three or four months after I've graduated college, I'm, I'm working for Trans-Urban News Service as a, you know basically as a reporter writing stories for--that go to the Amsterdam News, they go to CBS and the New York Times.  What CBS and the Times does, they, they basically use our stories as a tip sheet.  They'll use that--they'll give it to one of their reporters and one of their reporters will take it and, and work a story.  But the Amsterdam News will run our news stories.  So that's when I started seeing my bylines in the, in the Amsterdam News.  And I was at Trans-Urban News Service from January of '78 [1978] until the summer of '79 [1979] when I was laid off because the, the funding had run out.  But by that time, I was applying to grad schools and Wayne Barrett, the investigative reporter at the Village Voice was an adjunct at Columbia [University in New York City, New York], he was also friends with Andy Cooper, he'd come by the office.  And that's when Wayne Barrett badgered me to apply to Columbia.  And what happened, I was applying to these other graduate schools for something other than journalism.  I figured I needed a master's in another field, but I kept getting cold feet about going to the schools that accepted me.  Finally Barrett in his pugnacious style, just said "You need to apply to Columbia J School, and he said you know what you wanna do.  There's no, there's no harm in having a master's degree in journalism."  So I got accepted.
Speaker 2: Was this the Michele Clark Program.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It was before.
Speaker 1: It was the graduate, it was the graduate school of journalism.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was for the master of science of program, which then was an intense, nine month school year.
Story_ID: 98348
Speaker 1: So I get accepted [at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, New York], which is great, but tuition is $5,600.  And back then, I mean probably if we adjust it for inflation, you're looking at 25, 30,000 dollars.  And you know back then $5,600 they said well you got a $2,000 grant and you're gonna, you know to come you need to make up the rest.  So I have this dilemma.  I've been accepted to the top graduate school in the country, but I don't know if I'll be able to go because how am I gonna pay for it?  A few weeks later they said forget about the, the $2,000 grant because you've been award a 5,000 grant from the Philip Graham Foundation [Philip L. Graham Fund] of the Washington Post.  So that meant that paid about eighty percent of my tuition.  All I had to do was take out some loans to cover you know, basically my room and board, which my room and board was finding an off-campus apartment and just living frugally during that school year and I'd be okay.  And that's what I did.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay where did you find an apartment?
Speaker 1: On 100--a one--a studio at 100, 145th between Broadway and Riverside, which turned out to be a great location.  I was like three or four, I was like three or four train stops from Columbia on the Broadway line.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was pointed in the direction of the George Washington Bridge.  So I could go see my, my aunt and uncle in Teaneck, New Jersey.  I could get back down to New York.  This was--and this was the first time--it was kind of funny because my first month going to Columbia, I was still at home with my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] and my siblings.  And that took an hour on the train to go uptown.  And for this Columbia year, I could not be, I could not be commuting an hour on the train because there was so much going on at the J School and on that campus, I needed to be close by.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So that's when I said it's time for me to leave the nest.  I'm, you know I'm--I had just turned twenty-four, so it was really, you know, the Trans-Urban [News Service] years I was a mature adult, but I was living at home.  I was working, so I was, you know I was contributing to the household bills and everything.  But it was time for me to get out on my own.  So this was kind of my striking out on my own.  You know my mother was kind of--I could tell my mother was kind of sad.  But you know it was, it was time to, you know, it was time to go.
Speaker 2: You could still go back home on Sundays for dinner.
Speaker 1: Yeah I could still go back home, but I--but I wanted to kind of cut the cord.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I remember it was a funny scene in the second semester when--after I turned in my master's thesis, suddenly it seemed like a bunch of us all got very sick, we had the flu.  And I was knocked on my back for three or four days.  And I remember it was like my mother's opportunity to come up to my apartment and kind of nurse me back to good health.  But you know she had been, she had been, you know, classic mother.  She had been kind of miffed that I wanted to make it clear that I was gonna be independent and, and take care of myself.  And you know what?  That was her--she prepared us for this because she taught us to be independent.
Story_ID: 98349
Speaker 1: She [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] didn't want us to be kind of like a bunch of like lazy mama's boys that--you know I mean I she taught all her sons to cook, for instance.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: One, the baby [Richard Dawkins] is such a good cook, he is a, he is a chef.  He studied in Europe in several countries, and he just called me before I left for Atlanta [Georgia] and said this was maybe his third or fourth year where he worked at a place in California called The Grove.  It's this exclusive resort where I guess the best way of describe it, Republicans and Democrats who wage political combat all through the year, this is the two weeks where they go away to a resort and they can be civil and just hang out.  You can get like probably [Senator] Orrin Hatch playing golf with [Senator Edward] Ted Kennedy.  But you know once they get back in Washington [D.C.], they're gonna be at each other's throat.
Speaker 2: Back to fighting.
Speaker 1: Yes, so he, he--I mean he's the person who plans the meals for these, you know these, these, these political elites.  So, and I mean so--and, and I like to tell people that 'cause I mean he must be good at what he does because they could pick anyone they want.
Speaker 2: Okay, so he must be very good.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  And my, my middle brother can cook and I can, I can cook halfway decent, I can feed myself.
Story_ID: 98350
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now you're at graduate school at Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, New York].  And you're doing well there, or you're struggling?
Speaker 2: That was the best--I probably--that was the best year of my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because I just realized I could just be really become the best that I could be.  I tried to use--and see the Columbia experience, since it was a campus and I was living off campus, I figured for this abbreviated year, I'd get the kind of campus experience I didn't get as an undergrad.  Because I could participate more in the campus life.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know the, you know the speakers, the other things that were going on outside of just my particular school.  What I liked was--what I loved was that you know before I was just kind of the, the nerdy kid with glasses that, that girls ignored or stayed away from.  And I, I found that you know I was--some women will now--were kind of interested in me because of what was in my head, for instance.  So you know that of course for a young man that was a, a, a big thing.  So I took care--I, I took advantage of every opportunity and it turned out that I won an award at the end of the school year, it was called the Robert Herron Award and it was for excellence, academic excellence, but also kindness and thoughtfulness with classmates because I, I tried to get along with everyone.  I thought I was in a, a unique class of 160 students from you know all over the country, all over the world.  It's a class that, you know as a, as a graduate, I brag about constantly.  I just say "It's remarkable, I was in a remarkable class."  My classmate was James McBride who wrote "The Color of Water" and "Miracle at St. Anna".  Wrote music for Anita Baker and Grover Washington, Jr.  He's someone I can just pick up the phone and just call at any moment.  Jill Nelson who wrote "Volunteer Slavery" and other books was in my class.  Betty Baye who was my--she's the big sister I never had.  An accomplished journalist.  Jim Dwyer who has won two Pulitzer Prizes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Just an amazing group of people who are--we are leaders, you know now we're the leaders in, in this industry.  And my classmates have thought enough about me to appoint me as the class agent.  So I, I've organized the last two class reunions.  We just had our twenty-fifth reunion and I was co-coordinator of that, that class reunion.
Speaker 1: So would you say that the most important thing coming out of that besides the skills that you were able to absorb, were those friendships, lasting friendships?
Speaker 2: The lasting friendships-- and Columbia, it gave me an incredible shot of confidence.  I'm now--I know I'm now the--I've become this like gregarious character that I was not before I entered the school.  I tend to be very kind of shy and cautious.  Where now I'm, I'm kind of bold and brazen at times.  And but it, it gave me the kind of confidence that I could do, I can do whatever I--I can do what I want and I'm expected.  And kind of like you get kind of a swagger where you're kind of expected to do great things for the greater good.  You know I--sometimes, I think sometimes either family members or other people don't understand that it's kind of like an unspoken requirement that we have given you the chance to go to the fifth oldest university in America, an international university.  One of the greatest, you know world-class university.  So once you get that benefit, you're expected to transport those skills, those contacts, and do great things for others.  So and I, you know I really believe that.  And I also believe this kind of thing, that Columbia's School of Journalism, we're on the side of the angels as far as, you know, protecting the integrity of the craft, advancing the, the craft of journalism.  And I'm around like-minded people who feel the same thing.  And it's, it's not that we take ourselves too seriously, we really, we really believe that, that, that stuff about what we do as a public trust and we have to do everything we can to, to be the best that we can be.
Story_ID: 98351
Speaker 1: Right.  Now you, you, you've got this newfound confidence.  You've done well there at the graduate school [Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, New York], and what's your next move?
Speaker 2: My next move.  I have a choice to either go back to Trans-Urban News [Service] because now they've got more, more funding and they can even hire me at nearly twice of what I was making when I started.  I was making like $8,500 and they offered me a position that would be 15,000.  And that was not bad money back then.
Speaker 1: What year are we--
Speaker 2: This is nine, this is the spring of 1980.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I get a phone message, and I still have that pink phone, you know that "while you were out" message.  And it's from the Daily Argus in Mount Vernon, New York.  And they wanna talk to me about the job as a reporter.  It pays 12,000 a year, which would be less what Trans-Urban News was offering, but it was a no brainer.  I said I'm gonna go work at this daily, and they hire me.  And I, and I wanted the challenge of daily newspapering.  And yes it was a challenge.  I just didn't walk in there and suddenly do good work.  You know I made stupid mistakes, but it was a chance to learn how to, how to become, how to become a reporter.  And I worked there from 1980 to 1984.  That's when I met my first wife, the, the late Joyce Ingram.  She was--when I got there, she was a reporter there too.  But she was just on the way out.  She was leaving to go work at the sister paper in Yonkers.  So a year later I run into her at a function.  And I get up enough nerve to ask her out.  And then, then we started dating.  And then about a year, year and a half, we married in, in October of '82 [1982].  And it turns out Betty Baye came to work months later and she--
Speaker 1: At The Argus.
Speaker 2: At The Argus, and she, she filled in, in the beat that Joyce had worked at covering housing and urban affairs.  So I had at that time like one of my closest friends from school was a coworker, and I, you know I met my first wife there.  And I--we stayed--Joyce and I stayed there until '84 [1984].  And by the way, we lived at--on Sheridan Street in Mount Vernon, and we lived in the same apartment house as Denzel Washington and his wife.  We used to see each other on the elevator and wave.  At that time he was on "St. Elsewhere".  You know he was a pretty good actor, but we had no clue that he would become you know, the super star.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 98352
Speaker 1: Joyce [Ingram] was--when we married, Joyce had just become an editor at the, the paper in White Plains, and it was an awful schedule.  She worked overnight from 8:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m.  I worked police beat shift until I got--
Speaker 2: At The [Daily] Argus [in Mount Vernon, New York].
Speaker 1: Yeah, until I got more of a, like a, a better kind of schedule.
Speaker 2: What was the paper that Joyce was at?
Speaker 1: She was at the Herald [Statesman in Yonkers, New York], the Reporter Dispatch in White Plains, which then was kind of considered the flagship until the paper's now known as the Journal News 'cause the consolidated all nine of those papers in Westchester [New York] and Rockland [New York].  But then she gets an offer to become an assignment editor at the Philadelphia Daily News [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  And I said "For what they're offering, you gotta take the job and then I'm gonna have to just figure out what to do in that area."  So we go down to, to Philadelphia area in the end of, the very end of '83 [1983].  She starts working in Philadelphia.  We get an apartment in Mount Laurel [Township], New Jersey, just outside of Philadelphia.  I'm able to get hired by the Camden Courier-Post, which worked out fine.  So that's what we did.  Our, our marriage disintegrated in '86 [1986].  So she continued, she continued working at the Philadelphia Daily News.  I was still at the Courier-Post.
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 98353
Speaker 1: Let me interrupt and ask do you think the conflict of your assignments at those--even though you were in close proximity to one another, that those assignments, newspaper assignments was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, the hours, the--there was all kinds of things going on.  There was--it was just the '80s [1980s].  So I think between the work schedule took its toll.  There's, there's a certain competitiveness that's involved.  I think there was also people were trying to deal with the idea.  You know my spouse [Joyce Ingram] was making more money than me, this was the 1980s.  I think on some levels there was some people still are of the belief that the man always has to make more than the woman.  I mean I'd like to think that this was a time where, you know we were still trying to figure out these two, these, these double career marriages.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So there, there was kind of this tension about are we gonna have, are we gonna have kids.  And so I think those kinds of--you know I think people could recognize the symptoms when a, when a marriage disintegrates or just kind of crashes--
Speaker 1: It starts to disintegrate, yeah.
Speaker 2: And, and these kinds of things happen.  So the, the marriage ends in '86 [1986] and divorce.  I'm single and working at the [Camden] Courier-Post, but not for long.  In '88 [1988], I, I remarried.  I married a woman named Allie Crump who's from Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  And then a year later we have a--well the end of '88 [1988] we have a daughter Carmen.  And we, we lived the first--we lived that first year of Carmen's life in Philadelphia.  And then in '89 [1989], we move over to South Jersey because we, we purchased a house.  So we live in Winslow Township, New Jersey in a section called Sicklerville.  And that's from '89 [1989] to '96 [1996].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when we move again because after--
Story_ID: 98354
Speaker 1: Now during this period, you've gotten involved in the National Association of Black Journalists [NABJ].
Speaker 2: Yes, during this period, matter of fact with Joyce [Ingram], my first wife, we go to our first NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists] in '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we go together.  And then by '84 [1984], I'm appointed to the board of directors.  And I'm, I'm Betty Baye's replacement because Betty left New York [New York City, New York] to go to Louisville [Kentucky], so that takes her out of the region.  They need a, a substitute.  So some people float my name.  They say I would be a good person to do this.  The interesting thing is that at that time I'm not living in New York City, I'm in South Jersey, which is actually closer to Philadelphia, which is in a different region.  But some people believe in me and they appointed me regional director.  And in doing that, when I become the regional director, I bring a different kind of attitude to the regions, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.  So probably for the first time I start building the region outside of New York City.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that's when we start--I co-found the New Jersey Chapter when New Jersey was a difficult state to organize.  By the time I'm finished, we have a chapter in Hartford, Connecticut with [HM] Richard Prince who I meet and we become fast friends.  We take a conference up to Rochester, New York, which starts developing upstate New York.  And also makes some inroads into Canada because we do a, we do a workshop on Canadian journalists, which I like to believe years later kind of gave the incentive to establish a Canadian Association of Black Journalists.  I think we planted the seeds in Rochester in 1988.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So yes I was doing a lot of my NABJ work.  I was, I was working with peers like Michael Days and Will Sutton and [HM] Paula Madison and Tom Morgan.  And these are people all who became, you know, leaders in the industry, top editors or news director types.  Alexis Yancey and Ruth Allen Ollson.  Yeah so that's when we were all on the board together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the association was growing quickly.  And we were making some major changes.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 98355
Speaker 1: So you, you're getting interested in NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists], you're a columnist there at the Courier [Courier-Post], Camden.  Tell us about any--your work with NABJ.
Speaker 2: That was my chance to, what I like to call like see the, the plumbing.  How the organization--how the association works.  One-- some of the biggest things we did was just manage the growth.  Like when I joined in '81 [1981] and went to the--my first convention in New Orleans [Louisiana], it was 250 of us.  And then we had about the same in the next year in Detroit [Michigan], about 300.  And then we had 300--I remember this number exactly, 334 people in New Orleans in '83 [1983].  And that's when the group made this break from the past.  That's when Merv [Aubespin] was elected president and his board was pretty much people of my generation.  And that was kind of a, a break with the founders who you know, started the group and tended to be the officers.  And Merv really focused on growing the association.  So it turned out the next year when we went to Dallas [Texas], our membership had at last doubled and we had about 1,000 people at the Atlanta [Georga] convention in '84 [1984], and that was--and was big news there.  There was the, the Hymietown case [HM Reverend Jesse Jackson incident] and that's when [HM] Milton Coleman came.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: And he was grilled by our members about what happened.  That's when [HM Reverend] Jesse Jackson came at the--spoke at the banquet.  You know, now that he was no longer a candidate.  A lot of that stuff, matter of fact, is gonna be covered today.  The final segment of my series on NABJ has been running in the Atlanta Voice.  So I finally, I, I elude to that, those conventions in Atlanta.  So we were growing the association.
Speaker 1: That's when I resigned as NABJ executive director.
Speaker 2: Yes, exactly.
Speaker 1: Because of Jack, Jesse's campaign.
Speaker 2: Right.  So through the '80s [1980s] we're growing the association, we're certifying chapters.  By the time I get out of it in '89 [1989], I think we have two dozen chapters around the country.  We've grown our scholarship program.  We're now giving at least five to seven scholarships, plus internships.  Will Sutton and others, we're on a constitution committee where we rewrite the constitution and bylaws to reflect the changes going on in the association.  We also realign--we do our version of reapportionment, we realigned the regions because we had to give relief to the, to the South.  The South was--the, the--our regions was based on old HEW--Health and--what's now called Health and Human Services map.  And the south was an eight state region.  But we've heard the stories about the--there's been a reverse migration of blacks to the South.  And the South was bursting at the seams.  In order for us to be a, a successful organization, we had to split the South into two regions and kind of realign the others to accommodate them.  So, you know, Will and myself and some others, we realigned those regions.  And I think that's probably some of our best work at NABJ because you know we had to make some people unhappy, but we, we created a, a map to help continue the, continue the growth of this organization.
Story_ID: 98356
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  And the meantime you're also growing in stature at the Camden [Camden Courier-Post] paper?
Speaker 2: Right.  By '9-, by the end of '91 [1991], I, I'm on the editorial board, but I've also become a columnist.  And from '91 [1991], the end of--very end of '91 [1991] where I wrote a, a column on spec about the [Supreme Court Associate Justice] Clarence Thomas hearings that turned into a, a, a regular column by early '92 [1992].  I, I'm this columnist that's, you know, read and then in '96 [1996] I move on to Indiana to become an editor.  So that's when I joined Knight Ridder in Gary [Indiana] as a, an assignment editor.
Story_ID: 98357
Speaker 1: Before we skip over to, to there, I wanted to go back to--you have an idea about doing a book on NABJ [National Association of Black Journalists].
Speaker 2: Right.  Something I remembered from my first convention [1981] was [HM] Vernon Jarrett cryptically saying that a, a--the first president or previous president took the records of the association and the, the, the old timers there kind of chuckled knowingly.  But I'm a twenty-six year old trying to figure out what's going on.  And I said I have to find out more about this.  And once I get on the board, I see how you know, the board structure works and what we're trying to do with this association.  So I said I'm gonna take this, you know, knowledge or institutional memory and this is association that needs kind of a book treatment.  The other thing is, is that I, I am truly kind of like nettled by the notion that we send out promotional material that says we're formed by about 50, 50 people.  And I, but I, I on--I'm always hearing about these people who say they're founders, and it adds up to much more than 50 people.  So that's when I decided myself, I said "Well who are these people?"  We need to find out.  Okay who has the list of who actually joined and who are these people?  We need to go talk to them.  I, I see Les [HM Les Payne], I see [HM] Joe Davidson, I see about a dozen of them every year at the conventions, but who are these other people?  So that's when I decide that I'm gonna write this manuscript about who are our founders and what was our early history.  And I start in 1990.  By that time, I'm no longer on the board of directors.  I feel I can chip away at this and find some time to write.  There are some people who are happy that I'm doing this, including people like Tom Morgan and a few others.  And then there's a, a history, a journalism teacher in Alabama who publishes journalism books.  And he, he starts teaching me about how to work with printers, how to get bids.  So I learned the whole art of self-publishing, I'm just doing my research.  You know, I'm, I'm doing research for a manuscript, but also doing research on the publishing business.  And you know after about 120 interviews and traveling, including like the trip I took to Washington [D.C.] to meet with you, Maureen [HM Maureen Bunyan] and now.  You know, do a face-to-face about what you remember.  I worked at this for two and a half years, and then by March of '93 [1993], the book is published, "Black Journalists, the NABJ Story."  It's a 208 page book.  I work with Rob King who was the art director at the Courier-Post, and we got as many of the faces familiar and unfamiliar, on the book cover.  But I remembered about the book coming out; there were several reactions to it.  You know there were some people that was happy that a book came out.  There were others that were kind of indifferent.  There were others that I made extremely angry because I kind of--they were kind of some of these rivalries or long simmering feuds that kind of laid dormant and I kind of brought them out into public again.  So--
Story_ID: 98358
Speaker 1: But you also did something else at that time, you sort of skipped over it, and that was establish August Press.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And tell us how you decided you needed to publish this yourself.
Speaker 2: Well I needed to publish it because when I sent the manuscript to publishers, and there was about a dozen to fifteen or so, I either got just out-and-out rejection letters where it just said no.  There were others that said you send something--this is well written, this is very interesting.  But it just doesn't work for us, or just commercially we don't know if there's a market for it.  And then there was a publisher that expressed some interest, and then decided not to do the project and refused to return the manuscript even though I followed the rules.  I sent a self-addressed stamp envelope.  And then it seemed they, they issued a dare.  They said "If you think you can do this, do it yourself."  Well luckily I had a spare copy of the manuscript and I, I took them on their challenge and I formed, you know, that's when I formed my press.  Published the book myself and after I did that, you know what I tell people is that, you know, "yes I was proud of what I did, but seeing I understood that okay, I've accomplished this, but now what's next?  What's next?"  So I decided to when I could, publish other authors.  And I worked with hat I thought was a, was a very good local columnist at the [Camden] Courier-Post, Rosemary Perillo [ph.].  And I approached her about binding some of her best columns into a book.  And we did that in '94 [1994].  Didn't do well commercially 'cause I was still learning the publishing game and sometimes the rules in the publishing game are there are no rules.  I still think we did a very good book, but it just didn't do well commercially.  But then I went back and tried again the next year 'cause Richard Carter who was at the [New York] Daily News approached me with a manuscript he, he did on the doo-wop group The Spaniels from Gary, Indiana.  And he heard that I had an interest in music, particularly jazz.  So he figured I, I would be a receptive ear to a book about group, what's basically group harmony and the blues.  And I did and we, we did that project.  So I published that one, that was my--that was the third book we published, and that was in '95 [1995].  And then by '96 [1996] you know, I'm, I'm looking for another job.  So I--that--the publishing kind of lies dormant for a while.  I go out to Gary, I need to concentrate on my job as an editor [at Knight Ridder].  But I managed in '97 [1997] to update the NABJ story.  So it's, it's in the form that it's in now.  A book with five additional chapters, illustrations, the--a copy of the sign-in list that looks like our Declaration of Independence.  So a beefed up version of the book comes out in '97 [1997].  At that point, I'm in Gary and that was for a brief stretch.  We went through what just happened yesterday.  There was that-the cataclysmic news that the Detroit Free Press [Detroit, Michigan] was sold to Gannett, and the Detroit News was sold to another publishing company.  I went through that in Gary, 'cause that's when Knight Ridder sold the paper.  So I had to figure out what to do; was the family gonna stay in Gary or go somewhere else.  And that's when the opportunity came in [Newport News] Virginia to come to the Daily Press as an editorial writer.
Story_ID: 98359
Speaker 1: So I moved to Virginia with my family.  It's a--kind of a fresh, fresh start.  We really are so grateful to come back to the East Coast.  I'm not really publishing.  I'm, you know I made another move and I'm trying to get, you know, quickly acclimated in my new situation.  But this is when Dan Holly comes calling 'cause he's been trying to publish his novel.  And he persuades me, he, he's persistent.  And by in early '99 [1999], we figure a way to publish his novel called "Sometimes You Get The Bear".  And that's when I, I changed my publishing strategy somewhat, where I tell people you know, just keep in mind I'm a, I'm a publisher.  I now publish books, but I have a, I have a resource issue.  So we find a way to do it cooperatively and, and, and make it worth the writer's wild to get into this engagement.  So I, I start doing that.  So, so there was Dan Holly in '99 [1999] with his book, Betty Baye's collection of columns came out in two, the end of 2000.  And then Elmer Smith did the same in 2002.  And then by 2003, that's when I go back and I write my second book on NABJ and I'm determined to do a standalone book about the modern era of NABJ, which I call 1990 to the start of this century.  And I always wanted to do that second book, but I said when would I find the time?  I have a full time newspaper job.  I'm a, I'm a husband and father.  But sometimes events force you to do things you feel you don't have the time or energy to do.  At the end of 2001, William McGowan wrote a book called "Coloring the News" that accused journalists of my generation of ruining the craft 'cause he said that multi-culturalism and political correctness had destroyed journalism.  It was a totally flawed premise written by someone who had not spent time in newsrooms, didn't know newsroom culture, even admitted it.  But he wrote a book that the right wing loved and used it as a hammer to hammer away at us.  And I just couldn't take it anymore.  I said I, I need to set the record straight in my own way.  So that's when I wrote "Rugged Waters" and you know the subhead is "Black Journalists Swim the Mainstream".  And that subhead is a metaphor for what African American journalists often go through in mainstream journalism.  We are battered on one end by people who think we're too aggressive, too radical, too militant.  But meanwhile in our communities, we're hit on the other end, we're told that we're not forceful enough, or we may be just in there just trying to collect a paycheck to live comfortably.  So we're--we walk that middle ground to do the best we can.  And it's kind of like in politics where American politics is at its best when it fights for the political center.  It flirts with the, flirts with the extreme right, the extreme left.  But when you come to your senses, you're trying to strike a, a middle ground that's for the good of the entire nation.  So we--I think black journalists in the mainstream press do that all the time.  They do a lot of things that people don't see that's for the greater good, like I think of how [HM] Paula Madison for instance handled the, the LA [Los Angeles, California] riots.  You know thank God she was the news director at the station in LA and she told people how to cover this, not cover up the rioting, but you know, bring some sensibility and some sensibility, some sensitivity in a tense situation, but still be journalists and still have integrity and still tell uncomfortable truths about what you're seeing.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And she, you know, she had that kind of sense.  And people who are editors--they do a lot of the little things.  You know a lot of times they're saving white people from themselves who are doing things, doing things that are well-meaning, but would be just the wrong thing to do.
Story_ID: 98360
Speaker 1: If you could write your own legacy, what do, what do you think your lasting legacy would, would--will be?  And you're a young man and I should explain that you've got a lot of years ahead of you.  So in many ways that's kind of a hard question, but I'm gonna still ask it of you.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I think if there's any legacy, I want, I wanna be able to show that I was a builder; that--with say what I did with publishing, with August Press.  It was one thing to write my own books, but I've published other people, which is giving something back to the community a greater book, a greater good.  I've empowered other writers to do their work.  I've empowered people to edit and create the books by these authors.  I want to have a legacy in which I have trained people.  I, I, I can point to other people.  I've, I've--I can point to people that I have not published, but I've taught them to publish their own books.  I can think of--I, I ran into one woman in particular, Trenay Floyd [ph.] who wrote a, wrote a romance novel based on coming to one of my publishing classes.  Or just calling me up and I just gave her advice.  Another young man who has just did a cookbook, he's a chef.  He, he bought my book at a, at a book fair and he followed up on the advice I gave him.  So that, that's the kind of legacy.  I want to be able to be a builder.  I want to be able to be a person who mentored students who become the best that they can be, and surpass you know, what I've accomplished.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's usually what, you know sort of like parents always want their kids to do better than them.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I, I think that would be the greatest thing you can do.
Story_ID: 98361
Speaker 1: Is there anything in your career that you feel we may not have adequately covered or not covered?
Speaker 2: Boy you've given me, given me a lot.  I mean there's other things I have done.  I'm proud that I'm, that I'm one of the founding members of the William Monroe Trotter Group, there's eighteen of us that established the Trotter Group in 1992.  And that's a, that's a sturdy branch of the National Association of Black Journalists.  I talked about in "Rugged Waters", black journalists from the mainstream is that when my generation comes of age after the founders, we start building sturdy branches to this tree trunk that's NABJ.  So you get the, the columnists in the Trotter Group.  You get the sports journalists who've created, institutionalized themselves.  You have senior managing and executive editors that are in a, a group of minority professionals.  You have arts critics and copy editors and news direct--TV news directors.  So we've created this infrastructure.  And I--that's very exciting to me.  And then now we, we, we're talking this year on the thirtieth anniversary, of NABJ babies.  Well these babies are ten, fifteen year career journalists who you know are at the top of their game and they're now ready to influence a generation below them whose, you know, now working on their student projects.  So this is--I like to build that tribe builds a nation metaphor.  And we need--you know we know we need to do, do more of this.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Good enough.
Story_ID: 98362
Speaker 1: I'd like to, to add if it's okay.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: One thing about my growing up as far as religion, I told you my, my, my mother's [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins] side of the family is Methodist.  And my father [Edward Henry Dawkins], my father was--I thought--now I was, I was under the impression it was Anglican, you know from Jamaica, but his surviving brother says he was a Congregationalist.  Well when my parents came here, the church that they ended up going to was a Unitarian Universalist church, and it's a very prominent one in New York, a very famous one, Community Church of New York.  Well I'm one of those rare--
Speaker 2: And you can mention it, you can mention it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm one of those rarities.  I am a cradle Unitarian Universalist, which oftentimes is a curiosity to people and we have a joke, an inside joke that we have to practice a good thirty second elevator speech where in 30 seconds you should be able to tell somebody who we are.  Unitarian, Unitarians and Universalists are part of the Protestant reformation.  We're probably on the, the most liberal end of the, the Protestant reformation.  And what we're--the way that we were different--traditional--I consider myself a traditional Unitarian in that I'm Judeo Christian in outlook, but I am not a Trinitarian.  I just don't understand the notion of the father, son and holy ghost, but I do believe in God.  So what would surprise people about Unitarian Universalist, they have produced at least six of the--six American presidents, including [President] Thomas Jefferson, John, and [President] John Adams.  There are many people in public life--
Speaker 2: You wanna name the other four?
Speaker 1: Yes.  I just did a--I just did a lay service on them.  Jefferson, Adams, [President] Millard Fillmore, [President] William Howard Taft, who was the only president, who was not only a U.S. president, but a Supreme Court justice.  There's two Adamses, because both Adamses [John Adams and President John Quincy Adams]--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Are, are Unitarians because a lot of Unitarians had settled in New England.  So you had the two Adamses, Jefferson, Filmore, Taft and there was one other in the late 1800s who is claimed as a Unitarian even though there is dispute among that.  And we're doing research to find out if [President] Ulysses S. Grant was a, was a closet Universalist.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: But there are many famous people in public life who are Unitarians and Universalists, including the great historian Arthur Schlesinger, Adlai Stevenson.  There are an incredible amount of scientists, social reformers, feminists, probably [HM] Lani Guinier got into trouble because I think her parents grew up that way and it kind of explains kind of, kind of the expansive way she could see the world.  William Cohen, the Secretary of Defense is Unitarian Universalist.  And I'm almost Evangelical because I've been focusing lately on the history of, of our, our movement.  Lewis Latimer is a Unitarian.  Among the black Unitarians, the head of the Urban League.
Speaker 2: The current head?
Speaker 1: No, who died in the accident.  Whitney Young, Whitney Young.
Speaker 2: Whitney Young.
Speaker 1: Whitney Young.  A feminist, a woman named Francis, Mary Frances Harper who's a late 18th century figure, literary figure.  She's claimed by two religious movements.  But she did a lot with the Unitarians because the Unitarians did a lot with the abolitionists before the Civil War.  So other thing is we had a--the woman who was murdered in Alabama--she was from Detroit [Michigan].  There was a white woman.  It was kind of like a turning point in the Movement.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: She was Unitarian.
Speaker 2: Begins with an L, I know.
Speaker 1: Yes, Liuzzo, Mary, Mary Liuzzo [Viola Liuzzo was murdered, Mary Luizzo was her daughter].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And one of our Unitarian ministers was--died in the Selma march [March from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, Alabama] 'cause he was beaten and then later died from his injuries.  So we have, we have quite a rich legacy in the movement.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Matter of fact, the dedication in Taylor Branch's "Parting the Waters", the dedication is to the All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I talk about that as every--at every opportunity because we tend to be caricatured in--often in the mass media and I, I, I like to kind of tell people there is a lot to us that you need to know.
Story_ID: 98363
Speaker 1: Well as a historian, we want--as--I'm sorry.  As a HistoryMaker, we want to know all of those things about you.  Let me ask you.  Is there anything in your life to the present, I want to emphasize that you're still a young man, that you might do differently, that you might want to change?  If you wanna give me a no answer, that's fine.
Speaker 2: I, I guess there, there probably would be things I, I would want to change, but I--my answer would be--I mean you can't have a, a good life unless you, you have to make mistakes.  I mean you have to make mistakes along the way.  And I don't think I, I haven't made any of those kinds of like fatal, devastating mistakes where you know I've gotten into like, like major trouble.  You know I just make the kind of mistakes you have to make to live a--anything amounting to a full life.  My philosophy is, is that you get one chance and every, every waking minute is precious.  So I try to do whatever I can to you know, do the best I can.  Now--and I don't mean just trying to just do you know, so-called good works.  But I, I just try to appreciate just every breathing minute of life because you, you, you know, you know it was ta--if it was taken away tomorrow I could say I, you know just a month short of age fifty, I, I've had a, I've had a pretty full life.  You know even though you're right, I am still relatively young.  So I'm saying to myself given if I, if I live to like the normal life expectancy, I have at last thirty good years left.  So I better not mess around.  I better make the most of what I got left.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Thank you very, very much.
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This has been a wonderful interview.
Story_ID: 98364
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  All right, tell us about this one.
Speaker 2: That's a picture of myself.  I'm probably five or six years old, so that would be like a 1960, '61 [1961] photo of me and that's for school.  That's a school class picture.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's me again.  I'm a little younger.  I think I would say probably, probably about age four.  Maybe I'm approaching my fifth birthday.  I bet, I, I, I bet that picture was taken in--we had a--there was a beautiful park in Bush, in the Bushwick Section of Brooklyn [New York] that we used to go to.  It was like a--kind of a hilly meadow like park at the border of Brooklyn and Queens.  And the thing I remember about that is the sneakers.  My mother had this thing about us--our, our sneakers had to be spotless, so she would--when we--after they'd get filthy after a while, she just put them in the washing machine.  So we'd have old sneakers that was just always pristine looking.
Speaker 1: I'm probably--that was--and there's a date on that photo, '58 [1958].  So that was--that would make me.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  July '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: That was just before my third birthday.  I'm sitting on the steps of our apartment house eating a popsicle.  That's either, that's either our house or it's a neighbor's house, but that's definitely my block.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a baby picture.  That's myself with my mother [Iris Carmen McFarquhar Dawkins].  I'm less than a year old.  We're in--we're probably in the park in Manhattan [New York City, New York] across the street from where we were living.
Speaker 2: I had these big, coke bottle glasses.  That's at a birthday, that one's dated too.  That's--I think it says--
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  June 16th.
Speaker 2: So that must have been at my fourth birthday.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  I'm sorry Jan--January.
Speaker 2: Yeah, probably didn't get--it probably got processed after the fact, so that must have been my fourth birthday in September '59 [1959] and they got around to processing the film.  I don't, I don't know what I was wishing for.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's me, my wife Allie [Crump Dawkins] and daughter Carmen.  And that photo is about--it's probably like at least two years old.
Speaker 2: That is my late first wife Joyce Ingram.  That was taken at her parents' home in Long Island.  And that would have been around circa 1983 or '84 [1984].  And Joyce died in 1998.  It was kind of tragic.  I moved to Virginia and at that time she was the highest ranking black editor in Virginia.  She was deputy managing editor of the Virginian-Pilot.  And sometime at--I'm probably telling you more than you wanna know.  But some time had passed after our divorce and we reached the point where, you know we had been civil to each other, but we reached the point where we were comfortable enough to you know, become like real friends.  She had been--she had battled alcoholism and we promised that we would meet on a regular basis and become good friends.  And a few months after being at the paper, I got a frantic call from the--one of the editors at the "Pilot" that she had died and her, her boyfriend at the time was just too distraught and just didn't know how to contact the family.  And I still, you know I was still in touch with her mother and the other folks.  And it was like one of these things.  She had an appendectomy and apparently some organs bonded and, and closed and then that's what killed her.  So she died just short of her forty-third birthday.
Speaker 1: I should have asked you.
Speaker 2: That is my father Edward, Edward Henry Dawkins.  And that photo was taken probably, it's at least a year or two old, so it's a fairly recent photo.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  He certainly looks the intellectual there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Ready.
Speaker 1: That's a photo from Columbia [University Graduate School of Journalism in New York City, New York] when I, when I got my graduate degree and left to right is classmates Betty Winston Baye, Robert David Adams who is--and also had a law degree and he's with the New York Civil Liberties Union.  The late Susan Johnson, who was also a attorney and close friend of mine.  And then, and me.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: That is a photo from 1993, the year I published "The NABJ Story".  It's also the year my Columbia classmate Jill Nelson published "Volunteer Slavery".  And next to her is former Black Panther, I think it's David Hilliard.  And we were on a panel about our books.  It was called "Dis and Tell" because our books were all considered controversial for different reasons.  Jill has that stare 'cause I think that's about the time when [HM] Vernon Jarrett and [HM] Les Payne confronted her about some of the stuff she had in her book.  Her segment completely eclipsed anything that me or, or David Hilliard had to say about our books.
Speaker 2: (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Well you know it involved DeWayne [HM DeWayne Wickham], DeWayne wasn't in the room.  But, but Vernon and Les, I guess they were the surrogates, they were like on her case.
Speaker 2: That was Houston [Texas] wasn't it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yes it was.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That is from left to right, that was Joyce's--probably her best friend from Long Island, Denise.  Next to her is Joyce's sister Barbara [Ingram Edmonds], and there's Joyce and that's me.  And that would have been taken in--that looks like a, a 1982, circa 1982.
Speaker 2: That is me with my, with my wife, my second wife, current wife Allie.  We are visiting her uncle in Asheboro, North Carolina.  My wife was born in Hamlet, North Carolina, pretty famous little railroad town that's the birthplace of John Coltrane.  And some, some major league athletes.  But it's just a little town on the--twelve miles from the South Carolina line.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  All right.
Speaker 2: That is my graduation pho--graduation photo from Long Island University [Brooklyn, New York] in 1977.  So left to right is my brother Keith and on my right is--that's my mother, Iris Dawkins.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a shot of myself and my friend Al Stead mugging for the cameras.  We, we--that was the summer we played in the, the Brooklyn city-wide basketball tournament on different teams.  We played for a very tough coach named Gil Reynolds who would be--probably his equivalent would be--he would be like Bob Knight at Indiana [University in Bloomington, Indiana].  Only I think Gil was tough, a tougher coach.  So we're just--this is just some macho teenage posturing on our part.
Speaker 1: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 2: That photo was taken probably around the time I was working for Trans-Urban News Service, late '70's [1970s], and I'm a dead giveaway.  You know any, any, any man that admits that we didn't wear those goofy fat knotted ties, you know I've outed myself.
Speaker 1: That photo is from summer of '75 [1975].  And I described escorting my grandfather to Florida.  So standing left to right--I can't, I can't identify this family member.  He's not like a real close family member.  But next to him is my paternal grandfather Wilfred McFarker.  Next to him is my brother Keith who's kind of hiding behind my mother.  And seated is my Uncle Handel, and next to him is my youngest brother Richard.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: I have a lot of fond memories from the Bedford Boys Club.  And that's a photo of our, our basketball team.  And we just won--either we won first place or we placed high in a, in a, in a holiday tournament.  So then I was, I was either 15 or 16 years old when we did that, and that would have been like around '72 [1972] or early '72 [1972].  Probably it looks like winter of '72 (1972) when that was taken.  Those are my buddies from Bed-Sty [Bedford Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, New York].
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  And where are you?
Speaker 1: I'm right here.  I'm the kid with the glasses.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Let's see.  That one, that's probably me as a, a college senior.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Again I'm about to--that was when a few of my buddies just decided to just on a lark, just, just go down to Virginia and, and Washington, D.C. for a few days in the summer before school started back.  So this was--I think I would be just starting my senior year in college.  So that was me on the left.  We were sitting on a park bench in Washington.  That was one of my best friends, Edgar Steve who died in the 1980s, and next to him is like one of our other buddies, Ed Batey [ph.] who's a, a sanitation worker.  And he was a pretty good basketball player.  They, they both played varsity basketball in high school.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's a photo of me on my block in Brooklyn.  That may have been the same summer.  And I was--by my junior year I became like a--I became hooked as like a, a really serious jazz listener and collector.  And at that time, the, the top radio station in New York was WRVR-FM, which by the time I started graduate school, switched to country music.  So then for years the, the dominant jazz station was an NPR [National Public Radio] station in Newark [New Jersey].  I'm wearing the WRVR's t-shirt and I'm just outside you know where I lived in Brooklyn.
Speaker 2: OFF CAMERA VOICE:  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay that's the last one.
