 Peters If you wouldn   t mind, could you each say your name and spell it for me? That would help.  D. Caves Okay, I   m Douglas Caves, D-O-U-G-L-A-S, C-A-V, as in Victor, E-S, and we   re down here from Wisconsin for the FATAGS  Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee Society  event this weekend.  S. Caves Sherry Cannon Caves, S-H-E-R-R-Y, C-A-N-N-O-N, then Caves, C-A-V-E-S, and originally from Bartlesville.  Peters Okay, thank you.  S. Caves Doug is originally from Muskogee.  Peters That   s where we   re going to start here, then. I don   t know if you want to alternate back and forth who gets the first reply or not. The first question is where did you grow up, and share, if you   d like to, about your background before attending Oklahoma State University.  S. Caves I spent my time growing up in Texas, Louisiana, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and high school and middle school was in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. Wanted to go to TU  University of Tulsa . My parents said no, so I came to OSU. As it turns out, I   m glad I did.  Peters Why did you travel to those states?  S. Caves My dad worked for Phillips Petroleum.  Peters That   s why you ended up in Bartlesville, then.  S. Caves Yes, and during that time, he worked on the offshore drilling when it was beginning.  5  Peters Then Doug.  D. Caves Okay, so my entire childhood and youth was in Muskogee, Oklahoma. My family was in the manufacturing business in Muskogee, so we were there. When it came time to go to college, I was the oldest in the family, and for whatever reason, my parents thought it would be a bad idea to leave home. They very much wanted me to go to the college in Tahlequah. I forget what it was called.  Peters Northeastern  State University , right?  D. Caves Northeastern, that   s it, yeah, Northeastern. They very much wanted me to go there, and after a great deal of discussion, I managed to persuade them it would be a good idea to come to Oklahoma State. That   s how I ended up here.  Peters Okay, and you say you   re the oldest. How many siblings did you have?  D. Caves Yeah, and I had two siblings. By the time they came along, which was only a couple years later, my brother went off to Texas to Rice University. My younger sister, after that, went off to Stephens  College  in Missouri. I guess I was the path breaker in leaving home, and it opened the floodgates at that point.  Peters Nobody went to Northeastern?  D. Caves Nobody did. (Laughter)  Peters Sherry, did you have siblings, then, also?  S. Caves Yes, I have two younger sisters.  Peters Did any of them attend?  S. Caves No.  Peters Okay, all right. You kind of answered this: why did you come to OSU? You knew you didn   t want to go to Tahlequah perhaps. Was OSU your   . Did you have friends that were coming here? What brought you to here, then?  D. Caves Interesting, my mother had graduated from OSU, and my father had attended here for a short time. He actually graduated from Oklahoma University, but they seemed to have a very strong attachment themselves to Oklahoma State. I did have friends coming here, and it just seemed like the place to go. The idea of going beyond Oklahoma to an out-of-state school never even entered my mind, so this is where I landed. 6  Peters Sherry, you said you wanted to go to Tulsa University.  S. Caves For no particular reason. I don   t think I had any good reason.  Peters Was OSU, then, also fairly close? Friends?  S. Caves I think it was more that probably my friends were coming here, yes. That   s probably why I wanted to go to TU, to do something different. (Laughs) That   s probably it.  Peters All right, so when were you here?  D. Caves We both came here in 1965, so it was    65 through    69, yeah.  S. Caves Spring.  Peters You both made it through in four years, and what were your majors?  D. Caves Good question. (Laughter)  S. Caves Mine is the simplest. Mine was humanities, so Spanish and anthropology. You could do a triple like that at that time, and it was called humanities.  D. Caves I started out in physics. When I took Dr.  Thomas  Winter   s class in electronics, I became very good friends with Dr. Winter. He advised me. He thought I had a great future but not in physics. (Laughter) At that point, I did switch to biochemistry, still thinking science must be part of the future somehow, but by the time I was a senior, I was really taking completely economics courses. I had enough biochem credits to graduate, and so I switched to economics, in effect. That   s what my postgraduate work was in, or graduate work, I should say.  Peters Were there other faculty that had an impact on you or impressed you that you remember?  D. Caves Sure, but do you want to answer that first?  S. Caves I might   of course, in this discussion of the major, the reason Doug didn   t switch to econ, which is what he decided he really liked, was because of the draft. You couldn   t do that. I mean, if you did that, you   d get drafted, so he had to graduate in biochemistry. Let   s see. Oh, dear, Dr. Ospovat was a   .  Peters Alexander Ospovat?  7  S. Caves Yes, I took a history of science class from him that I really, really liked, and I was very impressed with him. We both knew Dr. Cummins, Richard Cummins. He was kind of a mentor, I think you might say. I   m sure there were other people, but   . Of course, Margaret Brooks was someone that   . Doug was in the Honors program. Because I was his girlfriend, I was a tagalong on things that they did, so I was exposed to her, as well. That was good. Maybe some other names will surface.  Peters I also took Dr. Ospovat   s history of science class.  S. Caves Oh, yeah, I loved that whole topic.  D. Caves I mainly remember (I have forgotten names) professors in the economics department, Richard Leftwich, I believe, Sandmeyer.  Peters Robert Sandmeyer?  D. Caves Yeah. I   m a little uncertain which of these I had in my last year of undergraduate school. I did come back here and do a master   s degree after we had been out a couple of years. We were back here for a short time. I was taking complete economics at that point, so Leftwich, Sandmeyer, and then   . Oh, gosh. There were a couple of others I was quite close to whose names escape me at the moment, but really good instructors and challenging.  Peters You couldn   t change your major. How did you work that so that you could finish in four years?  D. Caves I graduated with a degree in biochemistry, which at that point I intended to never use. When we were seniors, we got married during the spring of our senior year. A longer story, but we applied to go into the Peace Corps, which we did, and spent two years in Africa in the Peace Corps.  Peters Where in Africa?  D. Caves In Malawi, then came back here where I started graduate work. At that point, I worked on a master   s degree in economics.  Peters I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierra Leone, West Africa.  S. Caves Sierra Leone   D. Caves Wonderful, yeah   Peters We   ll have to talk about that afterwards. (Laughter)  8  S. Caves Wonderful.  Peters Okay, great. What on- and off-campus activities did you become involved with? I   m looking for things you did both on campus and maybe other groups or organizations you were involved with off campus.  S. Caves We met at the Wesley Foundation. That was, I   ve always thought, for me perhaps, especially, that that was a very fortuitous involvement. I really felt my education centered at the Wesley Foundation in terms of opening the window to what was possible but also what was possible for me, to put me in the picture. There was that personal involvement and leadership to a certain extent that was very important, so Wesley Foundation. I also, I had a role (I can   t remember the official name of it) for the residence halls. I did some programing, brought in some programs for that. That wasn   t heavy lifting, but for me at the time it was, to do that.  Peters What residence hall did you live in?  S. Caves I was in Willard Hall, but this was for all the residence halls. It would involve   . The location might be one or the other, but the idea was to do programming for all the independents, I guess, in the halls. That and the Wesley Foundation   .  Peters Had you been a Methodist before you came here?  S. Caves Yes, I had been, right. I was also an assistant Girl Scout leader off campus for a couple of years. That   s all I can remember right now.  Peters Okay, that   s fine.  D. Caves Sherry mentioned the Wesley Foundation. We were both involved extensively with that organization. On campus, I lived in Bennett Hall my first year and then moved to Parker Hall and was involved in (I don   t even remember the names of the organizations) the groups that ran various activities for the residents in Parker Hall, and organized events and so forth. Then there was the group, more campus-wide, that I got involved with was the one that invited speakers here. The Forum, it was called, yeah. I don   t know if we had any real structure, but that   s what we called ourselves. That was a major on-campus activity, and that led me to get involved in student government, both the student senate and eventually served as president of the student body.  Peters What year was that?  D. Caves That would have been    68-   69.  9  Peters Your senior     D. Caves Senior year.  Peters    senior year. The Wesley Foundation, Reverend Bill, what was Bill   s last name?  D. Caves Bill Moore.  Peters Bill Moore. Was he part of the reason why you were involved with the Wesley Foundation, or were there other individuals?  S. Caves Actually, I would say we were here the last year of Vance Engleman and Carl Caskey. I would say that dynamic was magic. (Laughs)  Peters Before Bill?  S. Caves It was before Bill. Then, of course, they, with the help of Dr.  Robert  Kamm, we understand, were fired or moved on after that year. Then Bill came in, and he was of a different style than those two and didn   t have the ecumenical institute grounding, influence, I guess, that those fellows did. At the same time, he was broadminded and very supportive. I know now more than I did then that he was really making a difference in quiet ways. After they left, I think that really strengthened   . His role was very important, yeah, but the first year was Carl and Vance.  Peters Of course, Dr. Kamm, who became president in    66, was a member of the First United Methodist Church here.  S. Caves Yes, right. One thing I just remembered is I was in Mortar Board, whatever that   s worth.  Peters Were you involved with the production of The Drummer at all?  S. Caves Not myself.  D. Caves No, we were in touch with the people producing it, discussed matters with them, but we weren   t a part of putting it out, no.  Peters Okay, so you mentioned the speakers bureau.  D. Caves Yes, the Forum, right.  Peters What is your involvement with the speakers bureau and the eventual speakers policy, which is catalyst for many of the things that we   re talking 10  about? What do you remember from that experience?  D. Caves Oh, you know, it   s hard to remember a lot of the detail. I remember our involvement first was putting together a list of speakers, people that we might invite, and getting out the invitations. As a young person at the time, I remember being really impressed at the caliber of people we have access to, that we could talk to and would respond to an invitation, and be willing to come to OSU. In some cases, we didn   t succeed in getting them here because there were objections by administration here on the campus.  Peters Why do you think there was that push back from the administration for certain speakers?  D. Caves I think it was because they didn   t like what those speakers were likely to say.  S. Caves They were very explicit about it. I think, probably you know, you could not invite an atheist, and you could not invite a communist. They were very explicit.  Peters Are you familiar with the John Kenneth Galbraith     D. Caves Yes.  S. Caves Yes.  Peters    events? What do you remember about that event, or non-event? I guess it was kind of a combination.  S. Caves It turned out to be an event. (Laughter)  D. Caves As I recall the event, he had agreed to come, and this was going to be a big event. We had a big draw for that one, but through letters, I believe, and maybe a phone call, it was explained to him what was going on here with censorship of other speakers. He withdrew his acceptance.  S. Caves Well, not entirely. He said that he would accept if the speaker policy that the regents had put into effect was changed. He would come the next free weekend that he had, and he would come for free.  D. Caves Okay, but apparently that didn   t happen. (Laughter)  Peters If you have a chance to be here Saturday morning, we   ll have The Drummers, and we   ll have his letter.  D. Caves Okay, that would be interesting to see that again. 11  S. Caves Yeah, I happened to review that lately. (Laughs)  Peters Because my understanding was that the administration, he was a speaker they wanted. They had been nurturing that, trying to get him to come here. He then refused because of the speakers policy coming out of the regents. That now upset the administration. Thomas, is it Allster?  S. Caves Altizer.  Peters Altizer. Now, wasn   t he a theologian? He had a book that was     S. Caves God is Dead.  Peters    fairly controversial. (Laughs) Wasn   t that part of the catalyst for not inviting someone who was    atheist    or might stir   .  S. Caves Which he was not     Peters Which he was not, right.  S. Caves    which is an illustration of the problem.  Peters There was a reaction then, not based on reason or knowledge but based on perception.  S. Caves Yes, and there was the opportunity for Dr. Kamm and many political parts in the state to use a broad brush to incite real fear in the citizens about what was happening on campus and to their students. Most of the newspapers and the public support was very much behind limiting access to the viewpoints.  Peters I   ll interject a little personal, but I think there was a very strong paternal instinct by our administration. They were charged with taking care of these young people     D. Caves Yes.  Peters    while they were here and didn   t want the parents of the state to feel that they were exposing the things they shouldn   t be exposed to.  S. Caves Yes, and quite a different attitude from the OU administration to what was going on here, quite different.  Peters I   m going to mention some other names. Some of these people may have come after you were here.  12  D. Caves Could I say one more thing?  Peters Sure, sure.  D. Caves There was, ironically, an event where I was responsible for telling a speaker not to come. I won   t say the name of the person because I   m not   I think I remember the speaker   s name, but I   m not sure I would get it right. I don   t want to get it wrong. It was another event that would   ve been a large event. The speaker advised me ahead of time that he didn   t feel safe on the campus and he could only deliver his talk if he were allowed to bring a gun on the stage, not obvious but a handgun in his coat. I thought about it, and I said,    No, you can   t do that. Thank you for letting me know.    He said,    Well then, can   t come.    That was the end of that one, and that was called off within a few weeks of his appearance.  Peters Let me mention some names to you, and you may or may not have any recollection. Timothy Leary?  S. Caves Yes, that was early on. That was one of the   Altizer and Leary were the early ones that really upset everyone.  Peters And neither of them showed up at that time?  S. Caves No.  Peters Okay. Adam Clayton Powell from New York?  S. Caves Right, we were not allowed to invite him, were you?  D. Caves I don   t remember any details about that     S. Caves Yeah, that was during the same period, though.  D. Caves    but I know he was a name on the list.  S. Caves As I remember, the problem was that   well, I don   t know. He was communist or something, that he could be communist.  Peters Could be. Philip Berrigan? Berrigan, he was a Roman Catholic priest, active in the anti-war movement.  D. Caves Yeah, yeah, definitely.  S. Caves He was on your list to invite?  D. Caves I don   t remember him being on a list. 13  S. Caves Yeah, might be later.  Peters Abbie Hoffman?  S. Caves I don   t think he was on   .  D. Caves I don   t think so.  Peters He did arrive later, but I think he was after you all did your time here. Also, Jerry Rubin was another individual. Dick Gregory?  S. Caves Yes, he came.  D. Caves Yeah, he came, didn   t he?  Peters Yes, any reflection or remembrance of his visit?  D. Caves I don   t know.  Peters Okay, that   s fine.  D. Caves There was a big crowd, if I remember, yeah.  Peters Then Stokely Carmichael. I think he came after.  D. Caves He may have come after, yeah.  Peters Okay, and then do you remember Sexpo    68?  D. Caves Oh, sure.  Peters Tell us about Sexpo    68, if you can.  D. Caves One thing I remember about it   . I tell you what I remember, is being so busy organizing these things that I have very little recollection of the content for what actually took place. (Laughs)  Peters Maybe tell me about the organizational activities. What would you do when you were trying to organize an event like this?  D. Caves It was pretty standard stuff. It was find a place to hold it that would match the size of the crowd you anticipate, and a schedule that worked out for the university and the speaker, and then publicize it.  Peters Would you hold these things off campus as well as on campus? 14  D. Caves They were all on campus.  S. Caves There was one that we could only do if it was, you could only do if it was off campus, and I can   t remember who that was.  D. Caves I don   t remember any off campus.  S. Caves A name you didn   t give was Julian Bond, but he came.  Peters Do you remember Julian Bond?     I know later on, occasionally the Wesley Foundation would host. They didn   t have the first floor. You could hold a decent-sized crowd in there. I know they had a few things where the activity wasn   t allowed to be on campus, and they would allow something to be held at the Wesley Foundation. This was a few years later. In regards to the speakers policy, which really fermented a lot of response in a variety of different ways, I think there was pressure on Dr. Kamm. Do you have any idea where that pressure was coming from? Have any thoughts on that?  D. Caves Well, yeah, it came from, broadly speaking, the citizens of the state, but it came through certain state legislators and through the board of regents of the university. I do recall one event when Chic Dambach and I and maybe a couple of other students went to meet with the regents at one of their meetings. I remember thinking at the time,    Wow, these gentlemen don   t have any idea what   s actually going on on the campus. They don   t have any idea about what is trying to be conveyed by inviting knowledgeable and involved speakers from outside the campus.    It didn   t seem to be something they really even had as part of their world, part of the world that they conceived of for the university.  Peters Do you think they had fear, or do you think they felt threatened, or do you think it was just outside of their experience?  D. Caves My impression was that they really looked at the university as a place to train students to fit into what they saw as an agricultural economy of an agricultural state where non-agriculture activity was carried out as a sideline to agriculture, at least partly in support of agriculture. It just didn   t seem to even be part of their world to think about why someone like a Dick Gregory would be of any interest to anybody.  S. Caves Of course, the other thing was the whole setting of the time. I think there was a lot of fear of the kind of activities that were going on in Berkeley, well, on both coasts really, and that there was going to be a poisoning of young minds here. The idea was to protect rather than to help people experience analyzing, conflicting views and maybe being wrong once in a 15  while and seeing what that was like. (Laughs) We were not really being treated as adults or as almost-adults, especially women.  Peters Especially women. Do you think that they felt maybe that by inviting certain individuals to come speak, it might ferment protest or violence? They were seeing this going on on the coast. Do you think that was a fear, that it would happen here if we invited people in?  S. Caves Yes. We would have the picnics on the lawn. You weren   t supposed to be on the lawn, but we were on the lawn. That was just the beginning. It was this slippery slope thing. What was happening then is they were taking pictures and keeping files on people. Doug had an experience (I won   t tell it for you) when your dad was approached by the FBI.  D. Caves No, not by the FBI. That   s interesting, yeah. I suppose as background, I would say that I didn   t really think anything we were doing was really out of the ordinary. I did look at what was going on on other campuses in terms of disruption. What was going on in Haight-Ashbury in terms of really alternative lifestyles really seemed pretty wild to me. What we were doing here at Oklahoma State in terms of inviting speakers didn   t seem to me to be really even something that unusual, but it was stirring up enormous objection. I was amazed at one point when I went home for, maybe, it was Thanksgiving, and was seated at the table of my folks and my siblings. My father says,    I want to tell you that my friend who is a FBI agent in Muskogee has told me that the FBI has a file on you. I was disappointed to hear that.    That   s my father speaking about his disappointment. I was in a state of shock. Why would anything that we had done be of interest to the FBI?  S. Caves My memory of that story was that the agent asked your dad if he wanted to see the file     D. Caves Yeah, right, that   s true.  S. Caves    and your dad said   .  D. Caves I think he said no.  S. Caves He said no, he didn   t want to see it. He was really   . I think he was not sure that that was supposed to happen. (Laughs)  Peters He, your dad, was more concerned with the surveillance than he was with your activities?  16  D. Caves I think he was concerned with that, but it did cause him to wonder if maybe we were involved in something more than met the eye, which we certainly didn   t know about if we were. (Laughs)  S. Caves When we told my parents that we were going to get married, nobody was very surprised about that. We told them we were going to get married, my dad said,    Okay, well, that   s good. Now   ,    and then he started lecturing Doug about seeing his name in the newspaper and Communism. That was what was more important.  Peters Did you share that information with your friends when you returned to campus, that at Thanksgiving or whatever it was, that you had found out that you may be under surveillance and that others may be under surveillance? Did you suspect that beforehand?  S. Caves We knew there were files. They were out taking pictures. In fact, some of the newspaper cartoons are Eual Gay and the photos.  Peters He was the head of the campus police department at that time?  S. Caves Right.  D. Caves Yeah, I think we were aware that   .  S. Caves I don   t think we knew that the FBI was part of it.  Peters You knew there was surveillance. You just didn   t know it reached the level of the FBI.  D. Caves Yeah, and other stuff was going on I don   t recall, but I wouldn   t be surprised if people had mentioned FBI. I don   t think I took it seriously. Then when this happened, I thought,    Wow, it is serious. For whatever reason, they   re investigating what we   re doing. Why should they be doing that?     Peters Why do you think there was more concern, perhaps, about women or women   s place or role? Can you talk about that a little bit, because you said there were differences?  S. Caves Oh, yes, yeah, but the changes that took place from    65 to    69 were incredible in terms of, when I was a freshman, the hours I had during the week and the hours I had on the weekend, to living in the dorm, and public display of affection and being grounded if that were the case if that was observed, all of it, and then having to wear a dress when you went to the Library. Gosh, what.... Anyway, it was really amazing.  17  Peters How did you know about these rules? How did you know what the rules were, that you had to wear a dress when you came to the Library? Was that written?  S. Caves That   s a good question. How did you know? I always wore a dress when I went to the Library, (Laughs) so maybe my   .  D. Caves They would ask you to leave.  S. Caves That could well be. I didn   t ever test it, so I don   t know exactly.  Peters I didn   t know if there was, like, a handbook that you were given, or was it assumed that you would learn through other contacts that these are things you can do, these are things you can   t do.  S. Caves I don   t remember that.  D. Caves Certainly the hours of the dorm     S. Caves That was very clear.  D. Caves ...that was pretty obvious.  Peters It was different for men than women.  S. Caves Oh, yeah, men didn   t have hours.  Peters At all, and women had very restricted hours during the week, and a little more flexibility during the weekend. Is that correct?  S. Caves Yes. I think during the week, (I may be wrong about this) I think it was eight o   clock, Monday through Thursday, and then ten o   clock Friday, and then twelve o   clock Saturday. Then Sunday, I don   t remember.  Peters When did it open in the morning?  S. Caves I think that was wide open, (Laughter) which I did take advantage of on occasion, yes.  Peters You were just an early riser that day.  S. Caves Yes. By the time I was a senior, I think women didn   t have hours. I might be wrong. It might have been that by that time, senior women didn   t have hours. That could have been. When I was a freshman, they did. Senior women did. We weren   t women; we were girls.  18  Peters So in your perspective, things improved     S. Caves Improved and changed.  Peters    your status and roles, and freedom on campus became more equal. Perhaps not equal, but better than they were when you started.  S. Caves Yes, and very quickly, really, when you think about it, very quickly.  Peters Why do you think it happened so quickly? Why   what was special about this time?  S. Caves I think it was so very   . I think that the change was everywhere, and those changes made what was going on here look so antiquated. It really highlighted that.  Peters I   m going to mention some personalities, folks. One has already been mentioned, but I   d like, if you can, to talk about him a little bit more. Robert Kamm, he was the former dean of arts and sciences, and then he is named president of the college in 1966. What do you remember about Dr. Kamm, because he would have started the year after you got here?  S. Caves Let   s see.  Peters As president, I   m sorry. He would have been here as arts and sciences dean, but taking over the role as   .  D. Caves He was the source of university authority. Ultimately, things went up to him. I had only limited personal dealings with him. I think we met once or twice when I was a senior. It was clear to us that we didn   t agree on   . I even forget what the issues were that we were dealing with at that time, but they had to do with rights of student government to decide certain things that he felt were best left to the administration to decide. We disagreed on that. He really liked to be liked. He liked to have students appreciate him, but we couldn   t do that. We had to disagree.  S. Caves He reminded me a lot of my father. He really   . I think the whole changing grounds, it was a fearful time, and there wasn   t any idea that the person that you were dealing with   . Well-intentioned but not willing to trust, in terms of my father, my ability to look at information and make a decision. He was fearful that I was going to do the wrong thing.  D. Caves I think the link there is that Dr. Kamm really saw himself as running the university according to the way people like our fathers and the people of the state thought it ought to be, in terms of turning out a certain kind of person that was exposed to a limited type of material. The idea of the university as 19  being a place of free and open inquiry where people follow that inquiry wherever it takes them was just not part of that view, and it wasn   t part of his view.  Peters And these are almost all men making these decisions. The legislature is men; the board of regents are men; the administration, it   s all men.  S. Caves It struck me, looking at those old clippings and the pictures, yeah.  Peters George Gries, do you remember George Gries? Once Dr. Kamm moved into the presidency, George Gries took over as arts and sciences dean.  S. Caves No.  Peters Abe Hesser? Does that name ring a bell?  D. Caves Sure, he was   .  S. Caves He decided that the ACLU was too controversial to hold their conference, I think, at the Union. That was amazing. (Laughs)  Peters He was the director, I think, at the Student Union at that time, so he had full control or sway over that area which was in part paid for by student fees or student activities and events. It sounded like he had ultimate authority. Louis Bullock  S. Caves Lou Bullock.  D. Caves Lou Bullock, yeah.  S. Caves He came after, a little bit.  Peters May have been a little bit after you all.  S. Caves Maybe a little younger.  D. Caves I think he was, yeah.  S. Caves I think he was there while he was   . Yeah, I think he overlapped a little.  Peters A little bit.  S. Caves Yeah, I remember the name.  20  Peters Then he goes on to law school and becomes a lawyer, I believe. Frank McFarland?  D. Caves That   s a familiar name, but I don   t   .  Peters That   s okay. Dewey Bartlett was governor at the time and apparently had some opinions regarding the running of the institution. You mentioned her earlier, Margaret Brooks. What can you tell us about   . She was a faculty member, Margaret, because Doug was in the Honors program. Do you remember her impact or influence?  D. Caves Sure. Her view was the university was a place of open inquiry and the pursuit of truth, and that there weren   t boundaries on what you should be allowed to look into and the kind of discussions that should be held. We really enjoyed meeting with her and discussing ideas in a way that you felt like there weren   t a lot of faculty with whom you could do that.  Peters Do you know what impact these events had on her career here?  S. Caves I was very vague about that until we had another reunion in 2006. I guess I did know, but I had forgotten that she was forced out, really, and ended up at OCU  Oklahoma City University , which is a great school, too. She really liked the Honors program.  Peters Do you remember the sociology department? Did that happen while you were here?  S. Caves Yes.  D. Caves It did, sure.  Peters Tell us a little about the events regarding the sociology department, because neither of you were in the department     S. Caves No.  D. Caves No.  Peters    but you were aware of   .  D. Caves We were aware of it. Were we out of town when that resignation happened?  S. Caves I don   t think we were.  D. Caves It was a major event. Everyone left     21  Peters The whole department.  D. Caves    the whole department. It was just gone. It didn   t impact us directly, other than being something that we saw as an indication of support for what we were doing. If there were capable faculty members who were willing to say,    If this is the way it   s going to be, I can   t be here,    that, to us, was a validation of the way we thought things ought to be.  Peters You said you had the opportunity to visit with Margaret Brooks and feel some sympathy or understanding of what your vision of a college experience was. Did the resignation of all of the members of the sociology department reinforce that there may be other faculty who would also be supportive?  D. Caves Sure.  Peters You just hadn   t had the opportunity to meet them. That may be broader than just Margaret Brooks.  D. Caves Sure.  S. Caves Oh, yeah.  D. Caves In fact, Richard Cummins of the engineering department was very supportive and was advisor to the student senate. We became very close friends with Dr. and Mrs. Cummins. They were very supportive, right in line with the others. I   ve already mentioned Tom Winter in the physics department, and I know there were others that either we didn   t come in contact with or we have forgotten.  Peters Sherry mentioned someone earlier. Alexander Ospovat was also very involved with the Association of   .  S. Caves AAUP  American Association of University Professors .  Peters AAUP.  S. Caves Yes. What I didn   t know until our previous reunion was the price that some of these people paid for doing that. We left, and we went on, and that was that, but they didn   t. They really paid, and that was very sobering to know that.  Peters Dr. Ospovat did not receive a raise for a number of years. Evaluations were excellent, but no raise. Do you remember Dr. Ted Agnew at all? He would have been in the history department and also with the association of college professors. He was also a Methodist.  22  S. Caves Oh, okay. Do you know Sister Jane Luecke in the English department?  Peters Yes.  S. Caves She was another person that was   I think she was helpful to Dr. Brooks, or maybe it was to the student government. I can   t remember what the connection was.  Peters We have hedges. Have you ever heard that some of the planting of hedges was a crowd control mechanism?  S. Caves Oh, no, no. (Laughs)  D. Caves Didn   t know that.  Peters Didn   t know that, okay.  D. Caves No.  Peters I remember there used to be hedges with thorns   on them. I   ve never had this confirmed. I   ve had people imply, who had connections with the former physical plant and landscaping, that they had planted these thorny hedges along sidewalks to prevent large movements of people from one area to another area. I didn   t know if you   d ever heard.  S. Caves No.  D. Caves No, I don   t know. I thought that they were to discourage people from going on the grass. (Laughter)  Peters Did the Library lawn   was it a common gathering point?  D. Caves No.  S. Caves You weren   t supposed to go on there.  D. Caves You weren   t supposed to be on the Library lawn for the most part. It was only when these Friday afternoon picnics started there, they were more or less a violation of that policy. We thought,    It   s kind of nice, sitting here on the Library lawn.    (Laughs)  Peters When John F. Kennedy was assassinated, they had a memorial service that took place on the Library lawn. When Dr. Kamm was installed as president, that ceremony took place on the Library lawn. There were events that were authorized to be held there     23  D. Caves There were events, very much, yeah.  Peters    but they weren   t   . They had to be scheduled and pre-approved, but you would gather on the lawn anyway?  D. Caves Yeah.     There were several times when I was a senior that I spoke to student-body-wide gatherings on the Library lawn, but like you say, those were approved. We had a process we went through, and people gathered on the lawn. Then there were other gatherings that were not approved. (Laughter) They just happened.  Peters Would the OSU police then show up, any type of     D. Caves No.  Peters    intervention? Nothing?  D. Caves I don   t ever remember it being confrontational.  S. Caves Are you talking about the picnics in particular?  D. Caves The picnics, when people went out on the lawn and they weren   t supposed to be there, do you remember   .  S. Caves Just the photographers.  D. Caves I don   t recall any kind of enforcement.  Peters Would students throw Frisbees and that kind of thing on the lawn     S. Caves I don   t remember that.  Peters    or was that a sacred area that wasn   t   .  S. Caves No, I don   t think that was common. Do you?  D. Caves I don   t remember that, no.  S. Caves Someone else might disagree.  Peters No, it   s fine. Were you involved with any kind of protests or subversive organizations that you   d like to share?  S. Caves When Dr. King was killed, there was a spontaneous march in sympathy for that. In fact, I went, and I bought black crepe paper rolls to offer to people to wear as an arm band, old-fashioned way of showing mourning, less old-24  fashioned then than now. We marched on the campus, on the streets, and when we went by the fraternity houses, we were berated for that.  Peters You marched up University Avenue, or do you remember?  S. Caves Yes, I don   t remember the route. I   m sorry; I don   t remember.  Peters That   s fine.  S. Caves I don   t remember how many people were involved. It was fairly spontaneous, but even showing that kind of sympathy was not popular.  Peters Then when Bobby Kennedy was assassinated, that was, I think, during the summer.  S. Caves I think it was in the summer, yeah, maybe June.  D. Caves We weren   t here. I think, really, other than going to some of the Friday afternoon gatherings on the Lawn, and then there were a couple of larger protests, so to speak, where large groups gathered in response to the speaker issues, and we attended those, but there weren   t really that many live protests going on here.  S. Caves No, there really weren   t. There was another faction that   I know faction isn   t quite right, but there was a group of SDS  Students for a Democratic Society  and so on who were   . I don   t even know if they tried anything. I don   t know.  Peters You never witnessed any violence during any of these protests. Weren   t they fairly sedate?  S. Caves They were very sedate. (Laughs)  Peters People would   .  S. Caves People wore suits. (Laughs)  Peters They might go to a location. There might be some speakers or interaction, but there was no   . I   ve never heard of any kind of threatening activity.  S. Caves No, incredibly civil, but they were described sometimes as riots or inciting riots. Absurd     Peters In the newspapers.  25  S. Caves    yes, just absurd.  Peters Are you familiar or aware of any concerns by African American black students at the time? Were you involved with any of their activities, or aware of their activities, or have any remembrance of that time for them?  S. Caves I was struck, coming back today. There are so many black students on campus, and that was not the case. It was a very small number of people that were black, so that   s a very big difference now. In our involvement at the Wesley Foundation in the coffee house, which was in the basement, I remember, I think it was Melvin Wade. I don   t know where the idea came from exactly, but as part of the program I made a dress out of material that looked like canvas. I   m not a seamstress, so it wasn   t much of a dress. He painted me in the dress. This is part of the performance. He   s painting while he says,    I always wanted to paint a beautiful woman.    (Laughter) Hyperbole. Melvin, I remember he was involved in that and in the coffee house to some extent, but I don   t remember. I wasn   t consistently there myself, so I   m not sure how much.  Peters Did you know his ex-wife? I think it was Margaret Williams.  S. Caves No, I don   t even remember the name.  Peters I may have the name wrong. She was also here for part of her undergraduate work. We   ve already talked about the resident hall visitation and hour issue. Do you remember Kent State?  S. Caves Yes, indeed. We were in Africa.  D. Caves That happened after we left.  Peters You were in Africa, so I think that was in    69, late    69 or early    70.  D. Caves Might have been    70.  S. Caves Would have been    70, I think, and we were appalled. We thought,    Wait a minute. What country is that?     Peters One of the things you said why you didn   t change your major concerned with the draft. At the time, it was   do you remember what your draft number was?  D. Caves Initially, I got a deferment to go in the Peace Corps.  Peters Okay. Before that, that would have been in    69.  26  D. Caves Yeah, the only number I remember getting was   .  S. Caves They didn   t do the drawing.  Peters They didn   t have the lottery?  D. Caves They didn   t have the lottery until we were in the Peace Corps, and it was in the mid-180s or something like that. It was high enough that, at that time, it looked like I wouldn   t be drafted. The Peace Corps got us beyond that. It was a bridge from college, among other things, was a bridge from being here to getting a high draft number.  Peters Tell me a little about what you   anything else you want to talk about during your years at OSU?  S. Caves I think you were listing individuals there. One thing is that I think there   s a remarkable group of people here that were part of the reaction, the resistance, the creative energy that went into all of that. I   m thinking of individuals, but all those individuals together, a really amazing group of people, and most of them from right here in Oklahoma.  Peters You   re referring to the gathering this weekend?  S. Caves I am, but more than that. There would be five thousand people showing up (I don   t know how many of those, not too many) at some of the gatherings. That   s a lot of people. They weren   t all there because they understood it or cared about it, but at least they were interested and they showed up.  Peters To a certain extent, you felt some support amongst the community. There   s pressure from certain voices in the state. You did feel a certain amount of support locally from either the Wesley Foundation or other groups and organizations, or individuals who were part of the   .  D. Caves Yeah, the student body in general. There were a lot of students who were off on the sidelines. They didn   t care a thing about what was going on, but there was a large group, very large group, that were very supportive.  S. Caves I think that   s worth noting. (Laughs)  D. Caves They might not be engaged other than showing up for some of the larger events, but they were supportive.  Peters Do you think that changed during your time here? From your arrival, you mentioned the changes in visitation and those kinds of things regarding women. Do you think there was a change on campus during those years 27  from    65 to    69? The place you left was different than the place you arrived at.  D. Caves I think it was. I   m always a little cautious about   the time you   re at a university is such a short period in the life of the institution that you wonder whether what you experienced was a different kind of four years.  S. Caves We did come back for that year and a half after Peace Corps, and, of course, we were in a different strata at that time. It was just about a different world.  D. Caves It seemed like the institution really changed from being one that really managed what students were supposed to do and think and say, to one that was really fairly open.  S. Caves Our viewpoint was so narrow and so limited. I really, really value the gathering that we   re having this weekend because I   m seeing so much more depth than we had then because our lives were   . We were students, and we were dating, and we were all these different pieces. We didn   t have a full picture. Now we can have a better one and appreciate more, I think, how courageous individuals were during that time, which is good.  Peters Sometimes it takes time and context to provide that understanding.  S. Caves Yes, and attention. I don   t think I was paying attention to that extent.  Peters Okay. Any other comments about your time at OSU, individuals or activities events that you   d like to mention, because I   m going to move on? Got a few more questions for you.  S. Caves I would say that it was incredibly valuable. It really did set the tone and the grounding for what   s been important to me the rest of my life. That   s been now fifty years, which is a long time. (Laughs) No, it was very, very important.  Peters It passed quickly.  S. Caves Actually, yes. (Laughs)  Peters Tell me a little, or as much as you   d like, about what you   ve done after you left Oklahoma State University. Why   d you decide on the Peace Corps?  S. Caves Because I wanted to go in the Peace Corps. (Laughs)  Peters You wanted to go in the Peace Corps.  S. Caves Ever since it started, I wanted to go. We got married, and we went. 28  Peters How did you end up in   Malawi, did you say?  S. Caves Malawi. You sometimes say we were going to go to South America, but we weren   t. I wanted to go to South America; you wanted to go to Africa.  D. Caves I just wanted to go anywhere.  S. Caves Yeah, you made me want to go to Africa.  D. Caves When Sherry said she wanted to go into the Peace Corps, it   s not as though I didn   t. I thought it was a great thing to do.  S. Caves We thought with the draft, we weren   t going anywhere. That was a huge surprise to get a deferment.  Peters It did provide the deferment then. What were your roles then as Peace Corps volunteers?  S. Caves We were teachers.  Peters Teachers, both of you teaching? What level?  S. Caves It would be secondary.  Peters Secondary, so high school level. What topics, subjects?  S. Caves I taught the History of the British in India, and English the first two years. This was teaching to the Cambridge Certificate that the British would give.  Peters The O levels  Ordinary levels, General Certificate of Education .  S. Caves The O levels, I think that   s right. (Laughter) That changed. Of course, we were there two years. Then the second year, then we taught to the East African course, which was coming out of the unification of Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania. That was going to be a new world for Africa, but then Idi Amin came in. Anyway, so the second year was totally amazing to me, totally different. I was teaching African history to Africans, (Laughs) which was great.  D. Caves I taught physics and math.  Peters Physics. Still teaching physics, huh? (Laughter)  D. Caves Let   s see. The high school where we taught had a staff that consisted of an African headmaster, and then it was basically all American and British    29  S. Caves And Canadian. There was one Canadian.  D. Caves    teachers, yeah, Canadian. Then there was an African who ran the physical education classes, so it was   .  S. Caves This wasn   t a boarding school. It was called a day school, but the students came from all over the country. Then they had to provide their own housing and food there, so they lived in an abandoned primary-school building.  Peters Then they would come over to the school to attend classes.  S. Caves Yeah.  Peters Were the classes all in English?  S. Caves Yes, English was the official language of the country.  Peters Okay, and everyone spoke English as we are familiar with it, or were there derivatives, I guess? Some countries speak more of a Pidgin or Creole, but I think in East Africa, I think their English was English.  D. Caves It was pretty     S. Caves It was quite good.  D. Caves    straight English. It had some British influence. There were occasional words from the African language that would be used     S. Caves Ujeni  generic Malawian catchall word . (Laughs)  D. Caves    as much by the Peace Corps as by the students, but they would fit in.  Peters Any Swahili because of Tanzania and Kenya?  S. Caves I think there was a little but not as much.  Peters You stayed the full tour of two years. Was your training before in-country, or was it in Malawi?  S. Caves In-country. We were one of the first groups to train in country.  Peters Okay, so you trained there and then had your tour. Then you returned to the States, and you returned to Oklahoma State University then?  D. Caves We did. 30  S. Caves We actually traveled for a couple of months on the way home. (Laughs)  Peters Okay, did you get a readjustment allowance while you were in the Peace Corps?  D. Caves Yes, they would give you     S. Caves I think we did. Seventy dollars a month or something.  D. Caves Yeah, something like that.  Peters For each semester you were there, and then you got it as a   .  D. Caves You spent that on your way home. (Laughter)  Peters Did you travel anywhere between   . Did you come straight home, or did you travel?  D. Caves No, we spent     S. Caves We spent two months.  D. Caves    several months in Europe.  Peters In Europe?  S. Caves Yeah, we went to Cairo on the way back.  Peters Then probably Cairo, and then up into Europe.  S. Caves And Greece.  D. Caves Greece, Yugoslavia.  S. Caves Yugoslavia, Italy.  D. Caves Worked our way over to England, visited the people we had taught with in Africa, and then came home.  Peters Then came home, okay. Then returned to Oklahoma State after your travels and finished a master   s degree?  D. Caves See, I wanted to switch to economics. I didn   t think I was in a good position to apply to the grad schools I wanted to apply to with my biochemistry degree, so I came back here to do a master   s degree in economics first, and 31  then applied to several schools and ended up at the University of Wisconsin for a PhD degree. At that point, we left here. We moved up to Wisconsin. To make a very short story, finished a PhD there, but on the way to doing that, got involved in doing consulting with my major professor. We eventually set up a company and stayed there, so I stayed there in Madison, and that company was my career.  Peters What   s the name of the company?  D. Caves It was called Christensen Associates. We had about fifty to sixty consultants, economists, and engineers and worked in a variety of industries in economics and economics as it relates to engineering in some of them. I   m retired, but the company still carries on.  Peters Any difficulty in the transition from having grown up in Oklahoma to living in Wisconsin, or did that go fairly smoothly?  D. Caves I would say that was very smooth, other than a little bit of shock, initially, at the amount of money we had to spend on warm clothing when we first moved up there. (Laughter)  S. Caves Also, we were used to being liberal here, but we were conservative there. (Laughs) We got used to that. (Laughs)  Peters You got past that. To wrap this up, and you kind of alluded to this   how did your life here at OSU impact the rest of your life?  D. Caves I think the things we learned to deal with when we were here as undergraduates gave us an approach to life in general. During that time, in your college time you change from a high school student to a mature individual. Through the things we were exposed to at Wesley Foundation and here, with all the campus activities, the kind of decisions we had to make, the way we had to learn how to deal with all kinds of people, was a great way to be prepared for whatever life might throw at you thereafter.  Peters And in some regards, it probably prepared you for the Peace Corps, too, because there are challenges and conflicts and adjustments in that transition.  S. Caves I would say one of the things, a really valuable experience for me, that the university gave me was I taught, as a senior, a freshman orientation class. I don   t remember if it was six weeks or nine weeks, but I would meet a group of freshmen once a week. I don   t remember how many hours, two or three hours, some period of time. Maybe it was two; that sounds like a lot. The whole curriculum for that was mine to decide. Wow, that   s amazing. When you think of this university who doesn   t trust me to manage my life to get 32  home at a reasonable hour or not, that was my job that I got to do. I think I got paid a minimal amount, but that was just fantastic. I really, really enjoyed it because I had to decide what these freshmen would need to know to get the most out of their college experience. That helped me understand what I got, too, and they seemed to enjoy the class. (Laughs)  Peters Any final comments or thoughts?  D. Caves I think it   s been amazing the way the group we   re here with this weekend has   . I wouldn   t say we   ve stayed in close touch over fifty years, but over time we continue to get back to each other. There   s a bond that goes back to our time in college and to the experiences we had. It was really quite significant and quite valuable.  S. Caves I think that goes back to the kind of people and the quality of people that were here. (Laughs)  Peters Is it Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee? Is that the term?  S. Caves Yes.  D. Caves That   s it. Friday Afternoon Tea and Glee Society.  Peters Why was that moniker selected? Any idea? (Laughter)  D. Caves Maybe someone else knows that.  S. Caves I think that that was   . If you were going to be an official group on campus, you had to apply for status. There was a group that had that name, and they   were gone. They didn   t use it any longer. Somebody decided this is what we would use to have the picnics and so on, and we would have a name.  D. Caves It didn   t mean anything. (Laughs)  S. Caves There was no membership. There was no description.  Peters No dues, no initiation. (Laughter)  S. Caves No initiation. There was no theme song, no.  Peters Secret handshake, none of that?(Laughter)  D. Caves No.  S. Caves No, not that I know of. 33  Peters Okay. It does seem like a wonderful group of people, and I call myself fortunate to be able to at least talk to several and then to meet you today.  S. Caves Thank you.  Peters I need to sign off. This is David Peters. It   s September 14, 2017, and I   m concluding the interview now. Thank you.  -------  -------
