Speaker 1: Sir, my name is Larry Crowe.  I'm the interviewer today for The HistoryMakers.  Our videographer is the famous Mr. Scott Stearns.  Sir, could you please state your name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: My name is Robert, R-O-B-E-R-T, Spencer, S-P-E-N-C-E-R, Beale, B-E-A-L-E. Senior as usual.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 193069
Speaker 1: Alright, sir what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born November 19, 1911 in Camden, C-A-M-D-E-N, New Jersey.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA CONVERSATION
Speaker 2: Robert R-O-B-E-R-T, Spencer S-P-E-N-C-E-R, Beale B-E-A-L-E.
Speaker 1: Okay and sir what is your occupation?
Speaker 2: Let's take the term educator that covers quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Alright and you're currently teaching--.
Speaker 2: Currently teaching in senior high school at Suitland High School in Forestville, Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay and sir what is today's date?
Speaker 2: Today is the 25th of September 2003.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're now situated in my classroom at Suitland High School.
Story_ID: 193070
Speaker 1: Okay, before we go into depth, there are five People Magazine-ish type questions, they are lightweight questions that only deserve a lightweight answer--short answer.  The first question is sir what is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food is actually cheesecake (laughter).  That's a dessert of course but aside from that regular food, I'm very fond of pigs' feet.
Speaker 1: Okay sir do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Green all the way.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Not really, year round is satisfactory to me.
Speaker 1: Okay and sir do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: No, I'd like to say that wherever I am and whenever is my vacation.  But I don't have any particular spot to go to.
Speaker 1: And lastly of these five questions, sir do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well yes I have said that nothing bothers me, that I don't let anything get under my skin.  I generally say my skin covers me very well, I fit in it and I don't let anybody get in there.
Story_ID: 193071
Speaker 1: Okay that makes sense.  Now sir I'm going to ask you about your family history.  I'm going to ask you about your mother's side and your father's side and--but first I want you to start giving me your mother's name and your father's name, spelling those names for us and giving us their dates and places of birth.
Speaker 2: My mother's name--of course they are all deceased, I need to point out.  But my mother's name is Mary Ellen, maiden name Porter, P-O-R-T-E-R.  She was born in New Jersey.  She was the daughter of an Irish indentured servant.  The practice was in those days for Irish girls to sign up to come to America and work for a period of seven years to pay for their transportation and living of course.  At the end of the seven year period, they were given a sum of money, I don't recall knowing how much it was, but they would purchase, at least my mother's mother did, she purchased a slave and moved with him up to New Jersey in an area where several of such people lived.  Gouldtown, G-O-U-L-D-T-O-W-N is the name of the community there and these indentured servants--Irish girls with the slaves that they had purchased would have children.  My mother was the result of such a union.
Speaker 1: Now when was your mother born?
Speaker 2: My mother was born there, in Melville, New Jersey.  Did you say when?
Speaker 1: When?
Speaker 2: 1875
Speaker 1: So that mean that--I guess if this--if your grandmother purchased her husband who was then a slave and moved to New Jersey which was a free state, than he would no longer be a slave.  So she was in essence taking him out of slavery.
Speaker 2: She bought his freedom, right.
Speaker 1: Bought his freedom and they must have, I guess done that prior to the civil war, I guess?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, he was a sure enough slave.
Speaker 1: Right because there was no slavery after 1865 or so as such.
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: So there would be no opportunity to purchase them.  Okay so they moved to New Jersey, I guess prior to 1863 I suppose and then they--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: We might deduce that because all that I actually know is that she herself was born in 1875, my mother.
Speaker 1: Is there any information about your grandfather the slave?
Speaker 2: Not my maternal grandfather because he was the slave (laughter).
Speaker 1: Yeah but--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: An Irish girl purchased--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Is there any other information about him in terms of what he did for a living and things of this nature?
Speaker 2: He was a slave (laughter).  He was a slave.
Speaker 1: He must have been a charming slave; she bought him out of slavery.
Speaker 2: Well a lot of those indentured servants did that and they would move to south New Jersey, they would move to Delaware and to Pennsylvania and there are enclaves where these people lived.  Their descendants if you choose of the indentured servants.  Every now and then you'll run into them but I mentioned Gouldtown, New Jersey, if I thought a little bit I could think of a section of Delaware where quite a bit of this exists.
Story_ID: 193072
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother [Mary Ellen Porter] was raised in a family--did they have a regular family--I mean her mother and father?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother being the indentured servant who had bought her--worked out her period of servitude and her father was the slave that she purchased.  Now their livelihood, of course I don't really know.  I do know there was a boy born of that union whose name was Robert and I turned out to be named for him.  You were going to say something, I interrupted.
Speaker 1: No I was just going to ask, I might be asking the obvious but since he was purchased in the south and supposedly moved to the north where he was not a slave at that point, did they get married or how did they--they have a regular household or what?
Speaker 2: I wouldn't know that.  I don't know what the custom was as far as society went among such people.  I do know that they stayed together in communities pretty close together.  New Jersey of course, being a farming state no doubt the slave did farming that is my maternal grandfather.  But that's really all that I would know about that side.
Speaker 1: Okay so did you--did your mother talk about growing up in that community?
Speaker 2: Oh I never talked to my mother because she passed in 1914 and I was only two and half/three years old.
Speaker 1: Okay so you heard the stories from other relatives, then?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Did your relatives ever--did they ever talk about your mother and what kind of person she was or what she liked to do or if she went to school?
Speaker 2: No, nothing, not that I would recall (laughter) at any rate because after she passed in 1914, I of course, did not have any discussions with them about her.  They knew her of course, my sisters and brothers but I didn't.
Speaker 1: How many sisters and brothers do you have?
Speaker 2: Well there were six children of the marriage, three boys and three girls.  I'm the fifth child.  In superstition it has been said that the fifth child is usually the best (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay we'll go with that.
Story_ID: 193073
Speaker 1: Sir now can you tell us about your father?  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Surely. His name is Charles, C-H-A-R-L-E-S, Henry, H-E-N-R-Y and Beale, B-E-A-L-E.
Speaker 1: And what is his birth date and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born in 1868 just a couple of years after emancipation.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in Virginia where I have to say Middlesex County.  A specific location is no available.  Middlesex County is in the so called northern neck area of Virginia.
Speaker 1: Okay now what do you know about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace his side?
Speaker 2: Well he--his father of course, was a slave.  I should point out that his--the family name, as you know the slaves took the names from the white owner.  So the family name under which he was born was Billups, that's B-I-L-L-U-P-S and to that extent his mother was Mrs. Billups and his father was Billups.  Then his father passed and the mother remarried and she married a Beale and then my father's name was changed to Beale.  So that marriage in my father's instance is mother had already had him and then she had--let's say had two--she had three sons and two daughters so she had five children with Beale.  The interesting part about it is that that branch of the Beale family does not have the e on the end of the name (laughter).  But they grew up in Virginia in the northern neck area then came the migration times you see and my father migrated on up into New Jersey and came across this very beautiful young lady (laughter).  A former indentured servant and all that stuff and--the daughter of the indentured servant and they married--
Speaker 1: Okay is there a story about how they met, did he tell you about that?
Speaker 2: No that never came up, part of the story that I got--that I recall is that when he met her in New Jersey that her people rejected him because he wasn't the right color.  Those people were as I like to say light, bright and almost white (laughter).  They really didn't care for anybody who was less than that in color.  But he wooed her and went on and had the family of which I'm a part.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 193074
Speaker 1: He [Beale's father, Charles Henry Beale] has a very interesting background however because he migrated to New Jersey.  There he met my mother [Mary Ellen Porter], they moved up to the northern part of New Jersey.  He was the sort of, I don't want to say he was a wayfaring type but he traveled around and did rather well.  When he married my mother or I guess you would have to put it like that, they settled in the northern part of New Jersey and then he moved to Camden [New Jersey] where I was born, you see.  They had a couple of kids born up in northern New Jersey and then two or three others in Camden.  He worked in the coke plant in Camden [New Jersey].  That's where they changed bituminous or soft coal into coke and the gases that came off gave them the gas so it was a coke plant and gas plant.  It was quite an industry, in practice still going on of course.  So that's where he worked at that time in the meanwhile he taught himself engineering--big word but it was enough for him to pass the examination in Pennsylvania as a stationary engineer.  Then got a job in a huge factory in Philadelphia where he was responsible for generating their electricity and heat for this huge toy factory.  I remember as a kid that he would take me there sometimes and I would see these toys being made (interruption)--.
Story_ID: 193075
Speaker 1: You said he [Beale's father, Charles Henry Beale] got a job in a toy factory?
Speaker 2: He was the engineer in the toy factory in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and I would have to say I more or less grew up in Philadelphia.  I was born in Camden [New Jersey] but that's just across the river from Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Now do you remember the name of the factory?
Speaker 2: Yes, the Albert, A-L-B-E-R-T, Schoenhut, S-C-H-O-E-N-H-U-T, the Albert Schoenhut Toy Factory.  They were Germans and this factory was in a section of Philadelphia known as Kensington where the population was primarily German and he was the only black person in this huge factory.
Speaker 1: He was an engineer.
Speaker 2: He was an engineer.
Speaker 1: Which means that he did what kind of work in the factory?
Speaker 2: Well he ran the equipment--in charge of the equipment that produced electricity for the factory and heat--steam heat for the factory--a huge factory.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A couple of blocks all the way around, four or five stories tall.
Speaker 1: So he was in charge of the physical plant like a school engineer would be in charge of the heating and the plumbing and all this sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Yes except that this much bigger than a school, this was a huge plant and the Albert Schoenhut Toy Company made toys and sent them all over the world, send them to China, Japan such as that.
Speaker 1: What kind of toys did they make?
Speaker 2: Most of them were simply made out of wood, dolls and animals, all sorts of kid toys.  They did very well until the Depression came along and a lot of things went down then.  That is the depression of '29 [1929], somewhere around there.
Speaker 1: So did--what did your father do when the Depression came?  Did he retain his job?
Speaker 2: No the factory went practically down to zero.  I really lost track of it because I sort of--well I was not living where the factory was anyhow.  I was away in college in '29 [1929].  So everything just went down pretty much to non existence, yeah.  So that's as far as my father goes because he passed in 1941.  But you might say what happened the prior twenty--not twenty, '29 [1929] to '41 [1941]--that's only twelve years.  During those years actually we were all on welfare of some sort of another.  So that's the way that was.
Speaker 1: People in those days worked different odd jobs or whatever they could get--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: There were no jobs.
Speaker 1: No jobs.
Speaker 2: That's right there were no jobs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 193076
Speaker 1: So you grew up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] in the midst of--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: The family moved to Philadelphia in 1920, I was eight years old.
Speaker 1: Let me ask you to reflect back on your early childhood.  Tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up.
Speaker 2: Well first we need to have in mind that I was the baby of the six kids, two of them died with my mother in 1914, the four of us grew up and I'm the only one that's around now.  The others went on beyond seventy and passed on.  So I was the baby and of course, they all saw to it that Bobby had no problem, they protected Bobby.  So Bobby was able to grow up and he was able to go to college and move on through with his education.  As far as they were concerned, each of them did his own thing.  My brother and sister finished high school at the end of the second year of high school-I don't mean finished, stopped high school after their second year and went to work in factories or whatever.  There were plenty of jobs for people in those days at that time.  My other sister went through--finished high school, Philadelphia and then went to normal school which was a two year college of sorts and learned how to teach.  So she became a teacher and moved to New York.  Bob is still there in Philadelphia growing up (laughter) and there were three of them, my brother and my two sisters after the two had passed in 1914.  So as time went on I became the one that they all looked up to and I was very well protected, I would have to say.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up, what did it look like growing up because it's different in the 19-teens than it is now?  I mean the streets look different--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well street crime as we have it now did not exist.  We didn't lock any doors or be afraid to walk down the street.  Everybody was pretty much looking out for everybody and if you want to put it that way even though we were in a big city, Philadelphia.  But I would travel around the city by myself as a young teenager.  I would get on the "El" as we called--elevator railroad and ride to the end of it way out to far end of the city and then turn around and come back just looking at things as they existed.  So it was a wonderful life in those days.  Today I'm afraid to leave my door unlocked in the daytime, you know.  So there was that kind of thing.
Story_ID: 193077
Speaker 1: Well, sir could you continue to describe what life was like when you were coming along?
Speaker 2: Yes, you of course, would understand that I saw all of these things in the course of time.  Public transportation consisted of streetcars with a pole on top which contacted an electric wire, we called them trolley cars and they would roll down certain streets and people would board them and go on to their various destinations.  In my time we did not have the horse drawn public transportation such as I had heard of before but we did have the electric trains and stuff like that in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  Automobiles were just beginning really.  I remember seeing a speed limit sign on the street where I lived, speed limit fifteen miles which is just barely a running speed.  One interesting thing that would happen every night when I was a kid where I lived in Philadelphia the Clydesdale horses with huge tank wagons of milk would go clump clump down the street where I lived, beautiful horses, well you've seen Clydesdales today.
Speaker 1: They were kind of used for the Budweiser commercials.
Speaker 2: The Budweiser people had them.  Well they would go out to one corner, I might say, in the city where the milk was collected from the farmers and put into these huge tanks and the Clydesdales would carry this milk through the streets to the dairies for processing, very impressive animals.
Speaker 1: Did the kids get excited when they saw these big horses?
Speaker 2: Well I can't say they were excited because it became a routine sort of thing.  They had these animals going clop, clop, clop and to see them and it was usually around 10:00 at night or so they made this trip on my particular street.  It was not the sort of thing that happened everywhere but I happened to be on a street that was busy like that.
Speaker 1: What street did you live on?
Speaker 2: In south Philadelphia the street was named Wharton Street, W-H-A-R-T-O-N which had tracks for the trolleys to run and it was just wide enough for three vehicles to go abreast if necessary.  The factories in Camden, New Jersey where I was born the main factory was Campbell's Soup Company and I remember seeing at a given time of the year, harvest time or such the wagons with big baskets of tomatoes and such farm produce going to the factory.  These were horse drawn vehicles and they would go there for Campbell's to process and can these vegetables.  I'd like to say that I was born in a city where Campbell Soup originated and RCA Victor originated there.  You've probably seen the signs where the dog is listening to this talking machine and it says he hears his master's voice.
Speaker 1: He's listening to the bell of gramophone.
Speaker 2: Well they called it a talking machine and that originated where I was born, you know.  I mentioned another company, Bosco Coffee a huge coffee factory there.
Story_ID: 193078
Speaker 1: I was around when the bridge was built across the river.  The bridge was built in 19--or finished in 1926 which was the year of the Sesqui-Centennial [Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition, 1926].
Speaker 2: Now this is the Delaware River?
Speaker 1: This is the Delaware River, right which separates New Jersey from Pennsylvania and I saw this bridge grow until the two sides met.  It took a few years to build it (laugh), huge bridge, of course.  So that connected the two but prior to that we crossed the river on boats.  The boats were self powered but they would churn on across the river and dock on either side.  For me to ride across the river was the grand sum of four cents, that was something.  I had relatives on both sides of the river.  So if I wanted to visit them, I would walk to the ferry, get on the boat, four cents and go to the other side and walk to where I was going.  There was never any fear of attack or stuff like that that you have today.
Speaker 2: Now the neighborhood you lived in was it a mostly black neighborhood or was it mixed?
Speaker 1: In Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] the neighborhood was completely mixed but in a pocket sort of way.  I lived in south Philadelphia now there were lots of blacks in my immediate vicinity, there were Italians in the immediate vicinity and there were Jews; there were blacks, Italians and Jews primarily.  My high school picture shows I'm the only black in that class of boys.  There was one other boy who was Irish, the only Irishman and all the rest were Italians and Jews.  My yearbook shows all these Jewish names, Italian names and of course there's Bob Beale and this Irish fellow.
Story_ID: 193079
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about what you liked to do in your youth?  What kind of activities did you enjoy?
Speaker 2: Well they often ask me even now what sort of sport did I go through in the process of growing up and I have to say my activity was chess and checkers (laugh), nothing physical.  I played chess and checkers in high school and that's the way I grew up.  Of course as an adult I'd go in for bridge and pinochle.
Speaker 1: As a little kid, did you read a lot and were you more active when you were a little kid?
Speaker 2: No we kids just played in the street.  We played hopscotch on the sidewalks and kids games and stuff like that.  We went to church every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your church?
Speaker 2: Baptist church, I grew up in the Baptist church.  My mother [Mary Ellen Porter], of course, coming from an Irish grandmother--her Irish mother, what do you think their religion was?
Speaker 1: Catholic I would guess.
Speaker 2: Out of Ireland, well it's Episcopalian they were--the early Episcopalians were the biggest Protestant group.  They protested the catholic beliefs.  My father [Charles Henry Beale], as far as I know, was Baptist all the time and with my mother passing, we kids were raised in the Baptist church.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your church that you attended when you were in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia the church where I was baptized was Union Baptist Church in south Philadelphia.  I have to say one of the better churches, (laugh) of course.  In New Jersey the church was Kaighn's Avenue Baptist Church, Kaighn's was spelled K-A-I-G-H-N apostrophe S.  I was baptized in Philadelphia.  As I grew up in the church and heard the preachings and teachings and so forth when I became thirteen as Christ did, I walked on down and said I want to join the church.  The parents had that type of influence on their kids in those days to keep them in church.  So that's the way my religion developed.
Story_ID: 193080
Speaker 1: Did you listen to music much when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: Well that's an interesting question.  I talk about the genetics thing and all this, the fact is my mother [Mary Ellen Porter] played in church.  My mother is this half white girl, my father played, both of them sang in church.  We kids inherited the music gene but I think it's primarily on my mother's side, I think.  But all of us could play the piano and sing, read music and sing.  Interestingly in my later years, my latest job in the church was being the organist of the church there in my neighborhood.
Speaker 1: So you played the organ?
Speaker 2: I played the organ.
Speaker 1: Do you still play now?
Speaker 2: Yes, I have an organ at home which I warm up every now and then (laugh).
Speaker 1: Do you play both sacred and secular music or do you--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well popular I would say.  I play popular music and in church I played whatever they sang but my regular style is popular music, the regular jazz and the swing type thing, I go back and forth with your left hand, I'm pretty good at that.
Speaker 1: Tell me now do you remember when radio came in, did you remember getting a radio or your family get one right away?
Speaker 2: We started out with the crystal set.  Did you ever hear of that?
Speaker 1: But what is it, it was not just a--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well there would be talk among the older--not really old among the young adolescence about here we have this thing we call radio and my sister who married when she was eighteen, her husband was nineteen and so they got the ingredients to put a radio together and that included this little crystal and cat's whiskers that you would fish around on this crystal and get some music that was being sent out over the air somehow.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?  Are you describing a vacuum tube or what is it?
Speaker 2: Crystal
Speaker 1: Like a rock?
Speaker 2: Like a rock, like a little solid piece of metal.  What was it anyhow, I'm a chemist and I ought to know the materials pretty well?  But these--what do we call them; we call them semi conductors now.  But those things were made out of metals such as titanium and vanadium and stuff like that.  These just had these properties picking up these sounds that were sent out over the air through some means or another.
Speaker 1: So how big was this set?
Speaker 2: About this big.
Speaker 1: You could kind of fool around and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Fool around with this little wire on the end of a probe as it were and you could pick up off of this crystal, different sounds and then if you were fancy you would have some kind of horn like thing so that it could amplify the sound and you could hear this thing playing.
Speaker 1: Did you have to use a headset for it or something to hear?
Speaker 2: No but that's as far as the sound went.  A headset, oh what's that--no such thing.  You would just listen to it, crowd around and hear music or whatever was being broadcast.
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like--sort of a random way of picking up materials off the air.
Speaker 2: You didn't know what you were going to get.  As I said there was this little thing we called it a cat's whisker and the crystal and we would just fiddle around on there, oh we got something here, you know with these weird types of metals.  That was the beginning of radio and that would have been back around the '20s [1920s]--early '20s [1920s].  And of course, the Philco Corporation came along with its stuff and RCA [Radio Corporation of America] came along with these developments and where are we now.  But that was the extent of radio, television was out of the question, it didn't make any sense, television.
Story_ID: 193081
Speaker 1: Now are there any big events that you remember in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] when you were a youth, coming along?
Speaker 2: Well the big event was the Sesqui-Centennial [Sesqui-Centennial International Exposition, 1926], a 150 years convention; the year of the United States.
Speaker 1: Was it a lot like a World's Fair or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah that's what it was, yes and buildings were built, some of which were rather temporary even as they do now and exhibits were held and foreign countries would put up buildings and stuff like that.  At Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia] right now, the Belgian Building on the campus there came from Belgium from the Sesqui-Centennial.  Belgiums just said let's just give that to (unclear) so they gave it to Virginia Union University.  So it was dismantled and chucked there and then set up on the campus.
Story_ID: 193082
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  What school did you attend in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: The school system was really interesting.  I sort of liked to mention it because it was so weird.  Now Pennsylvania, of course, never had slavery but it had racial segregation, it really had racial segregation.  The schools were segregated, racially.  Alright now, city's is all built up, you know here is a whole block of houses and another block and across the street and all around like that and here's a school regular city style.  I lived in a block where there was a public school and I attended that school.  That school had black teachers and a black principal and the kids were all black.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: That was the James Logan School, L-O-G-A-N [James Logan Elementary School, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].  The school was within the block where I lived so as was the practice anyhow, we would walk to school, nine to twelve, come home for lunch--walk home for lunch and then walk back at 1:30 to 3:30 and that constituted the school day--nine to twelve, 1:30 to 3:30.  All black in this particular school.  Across the street from me and in fact, two doors from where I lived there was a little store run by Italians who had kids.  Kids couldn't go to that school.  The nearest school that they could attend was about four blocks from there and they had--everything was walking so they had to walk four blocks to go to the public school because they were white and at that school they had a white principal and white teachers; that's the way it was, silly as segregation went.  But it was such that the white kids never had a black teacher or a black principal.  The black kids could go to that school, I could go to that school; I could go to any school black or white.
Speaker 1: White couldn't go to the black schools.
Speaker 2: White kids could not go to the black principal and teacher schools and that was rather weird you know.  But there are some other things about the racial matters which I have seen in other states too.  But the schools were good; of course, I had teachers there who were well capable.  I finished the elementary school there; I finished the eighth grade two years ahead of time because I was skipped for some reason.
Speaker 1: You must have been smart.
Speaker 2: They found that I had fairly good brain and I finished high school at the age of sixteen.
Speaker 1: Now sir I want to go back to grade school for a minute and ask you what were your favorite subjects in grade school and how did you do in grade school?  Who were the teachers that influenced you the most?
Speaker 2: Well my grade school teachers were all black and they did the job is all I can say.  I learned good penmanship, we had it in school in those days (laugh), good penmanship and--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Were those the days where you had the pen that you dipped in an inkwell?
Speaker 2: Yeah we had advanced to the inkwell situation and the arithmetic and the English and all of that were first class as they should be in a big city.  There was no noticeable difference between my all black school faculty and staff than this all white school faculty and staff.  They all had everything they needed.  So when I finished the elementary school, I went to high school which of course was all white teachers and administration.
Story_ID: 193083
Speaker 1: Now what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: The South Philadelphia High School for Boys [originally named Southern Manual Training High School for Boys, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania].
Speaker 1: Now did you have to take a special test to get in there or qualify to--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No, all I had to do was finish the eighth grade and automatically move on in.
Speaker 1: Were all of the high school segregated by gender?
Speaker 2: No, there were co-ed high schools.  This--in a sense, this was co-ed because we could look down the hall, of course the building was huge--we could look down the hall half way the whole big building and see through a doorway and The South Philadelphia High School for Girls was there.  We didn't pass each other or in the halls at all.  So that's the way that was for as far as sexes go.  Then at the same time in the city, there is William Penn High School which is for girls.  There's a Central High school which is for boys, strictly and then there is a West Philadelphia High School which is co-educational, male and female.
Speaker 1: Okay what were your favorite subjects in school?
Speaker 2: Science subjects and we had very good, very good teachers.  My high school teachers--I had Ph.D.s teaching me in high school.  The chemistry book we had was written by my teacher, Dr. Bradbury [ph.], Philadelphia having a right amount of money of course went on and had excellent education.
Speaker 1: Dr. Bradbury, were there any other teachers that stand out, that really inspired you?
Speaker 2: Well that interesting that you would mention that.  I can visualize other teachers but Bradbury being the author and teacher of mine stands out, I mentioned him.  Others whose names escape me, there was a Mr. Feik, F-E-I-K.  See they are all male teachers, it's a male school.  We would walk into the building with our hats on, that was routine anywhere, sit down anywhere.
Speaker 1: Now in high school were you involved in any of the extracurricular activities?  Did you run for class office--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, chess and checkers (laugh).  I learned how to play chess in high school.
Speaker 1: And you would say you're pretty good?
Speaker 2: I guess so, I still know a queen from a king (laugh).
Speaker 1: Now were you a good student?
Speaker 2: Yeah
Speaker 1: You were young; you were younger than some of the other students I suppose.
Speaker 2: Well yes, a couple of years younger.
Story_ID: 193084
Speaker 1: So at the time of high school graduation, did you know what you wanted to do for a career?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was going to be an engineer because my father was an engineer.  As a matter of fact, when I entered high school, I proceeded to take the engineering program but then after a year my father said, "Oh I changed my mind, I'd like to have a doctor in the family."  So then I had to change to the so-called academic program.
Story_ID: 193085
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about college, you graduated from high school and you worked for a year before you went to college, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: You said you drove a truck and did some other jobs.
Speaker 2: Right again, yeah.
Speaker 1: You tried to raise money to go to school.  Had you chosen a school yet?
Speaker 2: I hadn't really chosen a school when I finished high school maybe that's an unfortunate thing about a big city--a big industrial city because you can go and get a job anytime you see if you're alive.  So after high school I went there but I wanted to go to college and my father [Charles Henry Beale] being the active gentleman that he was had a lady friend who happened to come from Charleston, West Virginia and she said to him, "Well send Bob to West Virginia State College [later, West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia]" and that's where Bob went (laugh).  So that's just the way it was.  She met me down there and got me on the way.
Speaker 1: Now West Virginia State is a black school, right?
Speaker 2: Yes
Speaker 1: Where is it in West Virginia?
Speaker 2: It's in a town called Institute, I-N-S-T-I-T-U-T-E.
Speaker 1: Institute, West Virginia
Speaker 2: Right which is about fourteen miles from Charleston which is the capital of West Virginia and it's on the Great Kanawha River.
Story_ID: 193086
Speaker 1: Now how did you like that school [West Virginia State College, Institute, West Virginia] and--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Oh it was a great life, oh yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who started this, I mean can you tell us who started it and how it got--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well it was a state school; West Virginia built it and owned it.  I don't recall specifically how it became a land grant college.  I don't know whether you're familiar with that phase of black history in education or not.
Speaker 1: Well tell us.
Speaker 2: But I can tell you the--back in the 1800s prior to 1862, that's a specific year--prior to that higher education was for the sons of the wealthy white and that meant schools like Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [University, New Haven, Connecticut] and Columbia [University, New York, New York] and Pennsylvania [University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] were founded so that these white males could get their education.  They didn't have blacks going there and they didn't women going there--white males as I said.  It was noted--that was noted brought out in political affairs.  So the Senator [Justin Smith] Morrill, M-O-R-R-I-L-L wrote a bill and it passed congress called the Morrill Act of 1862.  This act meant that the federal government would give to each state a parcel of land considerable that the state would sell this land and use the money to build a college for ordinary people and that brought about the establishment of the so called land grant colleges.  The only requirement was that they must teach agriculture, industrial arts and home economics.  Each state did that and thus in Pennsylvania you got the formation of Pennsylvania State College [sic, Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania], in Virginia you got the formation of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.  No Virginia--not the university the school in Blacksburg [Virginia]--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 1: Virginia--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: VPI--Virginia Polytechnic Institute [and State University, "Virginia Tech," Blacksburg, Virginia].  In North Carolina you got the formation of North Carolina State which is in Raleigh and so on for each state.  Now that's well and good, this is for the ordinary people to go to college but in the south the ordinary people did not include the black people, it was only the whites who could go to those schools.  So in 1890 Morrill said we've got to make another move.  So he wrote and got passed another bill where the states were given additional land to sell and to establish colleges for the black people.
Speaker 1: Okay so West Virginia State was one of those schools?
Speaker 2: Virginia State is one of those schools.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 193087
Speaker 1: Well we were, I was asking you about West Virginia State [College, later West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] and campus life and your getting involved--simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: Beautiful I lived in the dormitory there and we were awakened every morning with a bugle and we'd go and eat their meals.  We could have social affairs in the gym.  It was just wonderful (laugh); it was just simply a wonderful life.
Speaker 1: So you were awakened with a bugle?
Speaker 2: Yeah every morning.
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen anymore I don't think on this campuses.
Speaker 2: I don't know, I haven't been on it (laugh) but they would blow that bugle--dat dat dat dat.
Speaker 1: Sort of like the army, everybody would get up and get dressed and come to breakfast.
Speaker 2: And we would also have--what do you call it--Taps at night telling us to turn out the lights and go to bed.
Speaker 1: Now that's unusual, I know that doesn't go on anymore.
Speaker 2: Yeah so that was nice and in the dining room we all sat around tables family style.
Speaker 1: Now did you have male and female students on campus?
Speaker 2: West Virginia is co-ed, yeah definitely.  We had separate dormitories but everything else was male and female.  We had some beautiful, beautiful young ladies there (laugh).  The one that stole my heart was a young lady from Rocky Mount, North Carolina strange as it seems.  Then I went through the usual thing, you know I graduated ahead of her and then she was left there with some other guy, whatever.  It was quite an interesting life.
Speaker 1: So it didn't work out, that one--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Not that
Speaker 1: Not that one.
Speaker 2: Not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay did you run for class office or anything like that or did you go into those kinds of things?
Speaker 2: No I was not involved in any political activity.  My fraternity made me the poll mark as they call them.
Speaker 1: Which fraternity was that?
Speaker 2: That's Kappa Alpha Psi and that was another part of the life you see of being in a college where you could participate in anything and I participated in various social activities.
Speaker 1: Okay did you take a pre med course of study (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well as it turned out, I majored in pure chemistry for the years I was there.  You understand I finished in three years, of course (laugh).
Speaker 1: Did you go to school during the summer?
Speaker 2: My financial status was such that I could not afford to go home during the summer so I stayed there and went to school for the intervening summers and finished in three years which turned out to be very nice as far as that goes.
Story_ID: 193088
Speaker 1: So you finished school in 1931?
Speaker 2: '32 [1932]
Speaker 1: '32 [1932]
Speaker 2: Yeah I went there in '29 [1929] and finished in '32 [1932].
Speaker 1: Okay and you got a degree in chemistry.
Speaker 2: B.S. cum laude, C-U-M, L-A-U-D-E, smart (laugh) majored in chemistry, minored in physics and mathematics.
Speaker 1: Now what did you--what were you going to do with that degree?
Speaker 2: Well it's still depression, you know.  There's still no money.  I worked my way through college really.  At the end of each year I still owed $50.00 and I could go during part of the summer and earn that $50.00 and then go back the next year.  But I worked in the cafeteria and stuff like that to pay my way through and chemistry lab, that was the main job I had.  That worked out alright financially but after I graduated, there was nothing to do just go on back to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and sit around and look because I could go to the welfare office and get some assistance there.
Speaker 1: So what did you do, did you actually go back to Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: And you got on welfare?
Speaker 2: On welfare and they were making these jobs.  You probably heard about they would have a guy digging a hole--dirt out of a hole and then another guy would come along throw it in (laugh) stuff like that.  Just so they would be working.
Speaker 1: You're talking about the Civilian Conservation Corp.
Speaker 2: Yeah CCC--
Speaker 1: --Works Progress Administration [WPA], all the Roosevelt programs during the depression.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was around for them.
Speaker 1: Now were you, did you have to make the painful choice of whether to vote Democratic or Republican (unclear)?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay so it wasn't a pain for you to vote for a Democrat or did you participate in that election?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't participate.  It depended on who had the necessary contacts around.  I'm trying to think now there was a political guy--a committeeman but I don't even remember what his party was.  It didn't go that way.  It was a matter of they had the money and they needed somebody to work.  I got a job in the Philadelphia Department of Health and this was one of the work jobs, you know and my assignment was to go throughout this neighborhood--neighborhood being a big section of the city and write down the addresses of vacant houses so I did that.  If the house was vacant, I was to try to see inside of it.  If it was open, I was to go inside and look it over and make note of what the condition was.  One day I was inside and the cops came up, you know (laugh).  A neighbor had seen me go into this house and he called the cops said, he's in this house.  Of course, I told the cops that I'm working for the Department of Health and we have to see if any sort of nuisance is committed in this house.  So that was that, one of my experiences, very interesting but that was the job to write down the addresses of vacant houses.
Story_ID: 193089
Speaker 1: Okay, so now your first--you took a teaching job at Huston-Tillotson College in Texas [later Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah well that's after I got the master's degree.
Speaker 1: Okay you went back to school?
Speaker 2: Oh after two years of making my way around in Philly, I was able to scrape up enough money to go to the University of Pennsylvania right there in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  I had registered each year and when the time came to pay the money, I had to drop out because I couldn't pay.  But the third time, as they say, was a charm because I was able to get the money to pay them and so I finished college in '32 [1932] and in '34 [1934] I was able to stay at the University of Maryland--of Pennsylvania.  It took one year to get the master's degree in chemistry and then with that degree, I was able to go on to Austin, Texas and work in a college.
Speaker 1: Okay so this is Huston-Tillotson?
Speaker 2: It was just plain Huston at that time, H-U-S-T-O-N [Samuel Huston College, later Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas].
Speaker 1: Named for Felix Huston, I think.
Speaker 2: I don't know which Huston it was at least it was not Sam (laugh).
Speaker 1: I believe it was Felix.  He was another free booter who fought the Mexicans for that land, yeah.
Speaker 2: Is that right?
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: Well the school was owned by the church, I'm trying to think what church it was probably Methodist--run by a Methodist church.
Speaker 1: This was a black school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: See the churches established colleges and schools for blacks throughout the south also.
Speaker 1: So you think it was a Methodist church that established this?
Speaker 2: It was Methodist, yeah.
Speaker 1: It probably was not an AME school; I don't think it was an AME [African Methodist Episcopal Church] school, is it?
Speaker 2: I don't think it was an AME, I think it was a regular white, Methodist whatever they were because the white religions were establishing schools like Shaw [University, Raleigh, North Carolina], Saint Augustine [Saint Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], Saint Paul [Saint Paul's College, Lawrenceville, Virginia], Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee].  These were established for black kids to get an education.
Speaker 1: So United Methodist or even the Episcopal or some of the other white denominations established some of the black colleges.
Speaker 2: That is correct.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 193090
Speaker 1: You were the chemistry department for Huston College [Samuel Huston College, later Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas]?
Speaker 2: Oh yes that was the chemistry department.
Speaker 1: So if someone went to the chemistry department, they'd come to you.
Speaker 2: I was it.  Yeah I taught all of the chemistry and I only stayed there one year.  I had a very interesting experience.  You know I credit my guardian angels who were looking out for me.  I had been there may be almost a half of the year with no supplies to do any chemistry lab work and I became inwardly disgusted and decided that I would go over and see the president that evening and tell him that if I didn't get any supplies that I just wouldn't teach any chemistry.  When I got over to his office that evening, which he didn't know why I was coming (pause) I sat down and I looked on his desk and there on his desk was a form from the University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], my school where I got my master's degree and where I had registered in the employment office and they get your credentials together your references and all and when you want to get a job they would send copies around.  They had sent these copies down to Sam Huston-Sam Huston I said didn't I--down to Huston College for me.  Then to check, they would send a form also after a few months for the reference.  When I saw this on his desk and I realized gosh this guy is about to write my reference and I became the nicest and most cooperative teacher he has ever had (laugh).  I became something entirely different, I was no longer mad or anything.  I just sat there and told him how well everything was going and so on and so forth.    He said well I'm glad to hear that Mr. Beale and I said thank you and I left.
Speaker 1: Now sir did you ever get any equipment?
Speaker 2: No I went on and finished out the year.  But I only stayed there one year because I was referred to another job up here in Maryland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 193091
Speaker 1: Now where did you teach in Maryland?
Speaker 2: Chemistry.
Speaker 1: I mean where?
Speaker 2: Oh at the--well it was called Princess Anne College [sic, Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Agricultural College, later University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, Maryland] in those days.  What happened was that in order for Maryland to have its land grant 1890 school for blacks, the state purchased Princess Anne College which prior to that had been run by the Methodist Church.  The state bought it and designated it as the land grant school and so the blacks were able to go to college at a price that they could afford, you see.  That's where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay now had Morgan State [University, Baltimore, Maryland] been established or compensated?
Speaker 2: Well the place had been owned by Morgan.  Morgan was running the school and the state bought it from Morgan and turned it over to College Park [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay that's the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Right
Speaker 1: So how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: I stayed from '36 [1936] to '39 [1939], I stayed there three years and towards the end of the third year but first you need to understand out here is a black school but it's run by the University of Maryland which is white.  And these are black school which is only going to get so much equipment and supplies and stuff to operate and I'm there trying to teach these kids some chemistry.  So I told the--and then there is this white overseer who comes over from College Park and tells the school what to do.  So he came here one day and I collard him, I said look Dr. Katterman [ph.], I said I don't have any beakers to teach these kids some chemistry.  He said, I'll tell you what to do, you know you have a boarding department here--we did--and he says what you do is you get some of those cans and wash them out and use them for beakers.  I said, oh, because he told me right then that I needed to leave (laugh) and go on and work on my doctorate degree because I could never make it under that circumstance.
Speaker 1: It was not a pleasant situation to be in.  I guess if you--you really can't teach.
Speaker 2: No you can't teach chemistry without a beaker.
Speaker 1: What did the degrees mean--what did the courses mean for students that took your course and couldn't get the equipment?
Speaker 2: Well it meant they went to college and went to college period you see.
Speaker 1: But they didn't really get the same kind of education.
Speaker 2: They did not get the same education and my title was professor of chemistry, physics and mathematics.  They had a big retirement program for me and I told them--the retirement program for me at College Park when I retired in 1986.  They had a big banquet and folks were there and I told them you know fifty years ago I was professor of chemistry, physics and mathematics at the University of Maryland eastern shore campus.  They all looked around you know but that's the way it was. I was quite a guy--big title professor in three big major areas--professor (laugh).  That's what happened there in Princes Anne.  It has gone through quite a few things since then.  They must have sprayed something around this building or something.  But it has gone through quite a few changes.  All those buildings that are there now, they're beautiful looking, fine.
Story_ID: 193092
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went on to work on your Ph.D.
Speaker 2: Yeah I went on to Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, State College, Pennsylvania] and I entered Penn State in '39 [1939] and I got the Ph.D. in '42 [1942] in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay
Speaker 2: But during those three years, I did all the work there and I also took a year off to work at Prairie View [State College, later Prairie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] to earn some money and I took a quarter off to work at Bluefield State College [Bluefield, West Virginia] and it all wrapped up, as they say, in 1942.
Speaker 1: Now 1942 the country was engaged in a World War II.  Did you--were you drafted?
Speaker 2: No I became qualified for one year--what was it-- one E or F each time the time came for me to go.
Speaker 1: Okay that was because you were a student?
Speaker 2: Well the first time I was a science major, next time I'm married with a child, the next time I'm teaching science and I never qualified as it were to go, so I didn't make it to Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Vietnam?  Germany is what I'm talking about, I guess World War II.
Speaker 2: I should have said Korea.  I don't know they went so fast.
Story_ID: 193093
Speaker 1: Ok sir, now tell us how you met Mrs. Beale, number one.
Speaker 2: Well when I was at Samuel Huston College [later, Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas]--that was the name, I'm quite sure--that was H-U-S not OU.  She went there as the librarian--let me see if I got that right, Samuel Huston I'm there, she's there--has to be--what did I say--Sam Huston in '35 [1935], no--yeah.
Speaker 1: You were there in '35 [1935].
Speaker 2: Okay '35 [1935] to '36 [1936] and she came there as the librarian, that's right it had to be yeah.  Okay and that's where I met her and of course we became good friends.  She was from Durham, North Carolina.  Well I stayed there one year and so did she and she left and went to High Point, North Carolina to become a librarian there, her old high school and I had gone to Princess Anne [sic, sic, Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Agricultural College, later University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, Maryland] to become this maxi professor (laughter).  So then we communicated back and forth from North Carolina to Maryland and that was '36 [1936].  So we got married in '36 [1936], yeah.  But I met her, she was a librarian and I was a chemistry teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay so you got married in 1936 and you had two children.
Speaker 2: We have two children.  My son was born in '42 [1942] so we had been married six years, that's right and then my daughter was born in '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: Oka, you've got a son who's a medical doctor--
Speaker 2: Yeah he became a medical doctor.
Speaker 1: And your daughter is a librarian, the head librarian in this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: My daughter is a librarian also like her mother.
Speaker 1: In this high school [Suitland High School, Forestville, Maryland], okay.
Story_ID: 193094
Speaker 1: And you served--I read that you served in eleven different institutions.
Speaker 2: Well I can rattle them off for you if you want.
Speaker 1: Were they all black colleges and universities?
Speaker 2: All black--no, no, no there is the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] which was very much white.  University of Maryland is an 1862 land grant college established so that the poor white boys could go to get an education and girls too.  But the colleges are, the first one is Samuel Huston [College, later Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] then came Princess Anne College [Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Agricultural College, later University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Princess Anne, Maryland] then came Prairie View State College [later Prarie View A&M University, Prairie View, Texas] then came Bluefield State College [Bluefield, West Virginia] then after '42 [1942] comes Winston Salem Teachers College [later Winston-Salem University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] and then comes Delaware State College [later Delaware State University, Dover, Delaware] next is--you run out of ink (laughter).
Speaker 1: Keep going, keep going.
Speaker 2: After Delaware State College comes North Carolina Central College [later North Carolina Central University] and then comes Virginia Union, that's eight.  After Virginia Union [University, Richmond, Virginia] comes Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] then I went back to Virginia Union for one year, I'll call it the tenth one and after that comes North Carolina A&T State University [Greensboro, North Carolina], that's eleven.  The twelfth one--let me see after A&T which now brings up to '68 [1968], the twelfth then becomes Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee] where I was dean for two years then comes the University of Maryland College Park, UMCP, and that ends my college stuff then I come here.
Speaker 1: Now after teaching so long why did you move to so many different--some people spend their whole career at one place.
Speaker 2: They certainly do.
Speaker 1: Why is it that you moved so much?
Speaker 2: I rode the salary crest, you give me more money, I'll move.  I had started the year at Delaware State at the huge salary of twenty two hundred dollars and I wanted a raise so my second year they raised me to twenty six hundred dollars, this is a year (laughter).  I want more money but we don't have any more money so they say.  But in the mean while the president of North Carolina Central contacted me and he says I need you here right now 'because his two chemistry teachers had left all of a sudden in September, they had left.  I said okay how much you want to pay; he says I'll pay you three thousand dollars.  I said I'll be there at the end of one month.  First of October I moved to Durham, North Carolina and as I tell people I would have signed a contract for life for that tremendous salary, I had arrived.
Speaker 1: Now when was that, what year was that?
Speaker 2: That was in '42 [1942]--wait a minute, I said too fast or did I--that was in '44 [1944] 'cause '42 [1942] was when I got the doctorate degree and went to Delaware.
Speaker 1: That is pretty good money for those days, six thousand dollars a year.
Speaker 2: Oh how much did you say?
Speaker 1: Six thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: No three thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: Oh three thousand, that's right.
Speaker 2: Three thousand dollars for twelve months, two hundred and fifty dollars a month.
Speaker 1: You know the cost of living was cheaper then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure (laughter) exactly.  Yeah we could buy a week's groceries for fifteen or twenty dollars.  But that answer to your question, I simply rode the crest as I went along.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 193095
Speaker 1: Alright, and the last college you taught at was not a historically black college, it was University of Maryland, right at, in College Park [Maryland]?
Speaker 2: Right. What happened was I decided when I was at Knoxville College [Knoxville, Tennessee]--I decided that--well first of all I went there along with the philosophy that had guided me through the years and that is that the black professionals should go south to work and help the black people, you see.  So you noticed I was in the south all the time.  Now I'm at Knoxville College and they ran out of money. So.
Speaker 1: They ran out of money?
Speaker 2: They ran out of money. And the Presbyterian church owned the school and it didn't have enough money to pay me so I left there.  Now I'm still living in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]--no well let me see, I'm a little confused there--however I left there and through some connection in Maryland--I forget what it was--I was put on a project assignment at College Park and then I went on there as a teacher of chemistry and then as an assistant to provost as they call them.
Speaker 1: Okay. And how long did you stay at the University of Maryland?
Speaker 2: Eleven years.
Speaker 1: Okay that's a long time.
Speaker 2: That was the longest tenure I had had (laughter) and now I have a tenure here of thirteen, this is my fourteenth year here.
Speaker 1: So you've been here [Suitland High School, Forestville, Maryland] longer than any other place, that you've ever taught (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Any other place, right.
Story_ID: 193096
Speaker 1: Before we get to this, I just want to ask you if there is something remarkable about your teaching career in colleges that you want to tell us about or some of experience that you--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well for the most part in these colleges as I moved around, I was the chemistry department and I developed the chemistry department however you want to put it and I was well received.  When I went to Southern University [Baton Rouge, Louisiana] as head of the chemistry department, they, the department had a reputation that nobody could pass, you see and I--and they also couldn't even get into classes in chemistry.  So I told the president, I said, "Well look set the class up for the chapel and I will meet them in the chapel." And I would get up on the stage with a board and go on teaching them chemistry.  I enjoyed that very much.  Interesting thing about it is there was a piano in there and before they came in, I would get down there and play the piano (laughter).  They would be coming in and I was banging away on the piano.  But I did that sort of thing to help the situation, to cooperate and get it going.  I'm talking about taking the large class in the, in the chapel.  So I have enjoyed my whole career ever since I almost messed up at Samuel Huston [College, later Huston-Tillotson University, Austin, Texas] (laughter) but my guardian angel gave up her life to rescue me.
Story_ID: 193097
Speaker 1: Now what you've done here is remarkable.  You retired actually from the University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] in 1986?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And--(simultaneous) (unclear).
Speaker 2: And I spent four years doing a lot of civic work.  I worked in the PTA. I became a regional vice president in that here in this county.  I'm a life member of the state PTA [Parent Teacher Association.  As I say, I did all of this playing the organ in the church and on the deacon board at the church, I did a whole lot of things in those four years for nothing and then came the call from this county for black males to come into the system as role models and here I am still here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 193098
Speaker 1: Just to backtrack a little bit, there's one question I had about your teaching career in the black colleges, you were a professor in black colleges during the civil rights movement when the sit-ins started.
Speaker 2: In 1960 I was at A&T [North Carolina A&T State University, Greensboro, North Carolina] and so was [HistoryMaker] Jesse [L.] Jackson.  He was a student--he was graduating from A&T.
Speaker 1: Did you know him well?
Speaker 2: No I didn't know him at all, I met him of course, I shook his hand.  He was president of the student body and I was there but not involved in any of his particular activities.  But yeah I was there and in Richmond [Virginia] I marched on downtown in Richmond demonstrating against stores who would not allow the women to come in and try on the clothes and stuff like that.  I was around but an interesting experience in Louisiana--speaking of civil rights--is Louisiana after 1950--let's see, I went in there in '52 [1952] so slightly after that Louisiana suddenly put up schools for the black kids to go to school and I did quite a bit of traveling around.  I traveled to one town and I stopped for gasoline and I chatted with the guy--a white man and he said, you're not from around here.  I said no I'm not, "Where are you from?"  Of course I'm very sensitive to where I'm from.  I know I'm in the south so what did I say to him, I said, I am one generation from Virginia.  Oh, oh that's fine.  He said, "Let me tell you something, you know they spent all that money to build that new school there for the colored people and we've got this school here for the white people which has plenty of space in it"--he looks around and he says, "I think they should have let those colored kids come to this white school."  He wanted to be sure nobody heard him but me (laughter).
Speaker 1: So it wasn't a popular opinion.
Speaker 2: Absolutely--
Speaker 1: But one that made sense to a man like him.
Speaker 2: And the results are an eye opener to the thinking of many of the whites that they're not in a position to fight these racists as such, you see.  But they still are aware of the fact that this spending an inordinate amount of money just to say we have a separate school and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 193099
Speaker 1: Now back to the high school situation--now you spent like four years before volunteering to do civic work.  You find out about opportunities here in the school system.  Well when you came into Suitland High School [Forestville, Maryland] how old were you?
Speaker 2: In '90 [1990] I was seventy eight, right--yeah-seventy eight and twelve is ninety.  My birthday comes toward the end of the year, that's where the other year comes in.  I was seventy eight when I started there.
Speaker 1: Okay and you've been here now for thirteen years.
Speaker 2: This is the fourteenth.
Speaker 1: Fourteenth year.
Speaker 2: I've been here thirteen.
Speaker 1: Now are you ninety one or ninety two?
Speaker 2: I'm ninety one
Speaker 1: Ninety one okay.
Speaker 2: The paper says I'm nineteen (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was a typo.
Speaker 2: I won't be ninety two until November.
Speaker 1: Now you're in a position--in a unique position.  You certainly can do the job, you are a very articulate man, an energetic man, everybody says so.
Speaker 2: Thank you sir.  I have misled you sufficiently (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you are still able to get a paycheck.  What are your--how do you do it because some teacher who are much younger complain about the high school students of today.  They say there are so many problems in the school, so many problems at home.
Speaker 2: There are problems, there are problems that the kids have in school, there are problems that the kids have at home and I have seen it.  I've been more or less a part of it.  I have gone to a kid's house seven o'clock in the evening, the mother comes to the door, blows me down with liquor.  I'm aware of the fact that the father is somewhere in the back of the house and my  purpose in going there was to talk to them about sending this kid on the college tour which I sponsor here every year.
Speaker 1: That's a tour that you're probably better qualified than most people because you've been to so many, over a long period of time.
Speaker 2: Oh yeah it's no problem.
Speaker 1: That's something unique too, now you sponsored a black college tour that occurs on an annual basis, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do it here annually.  It's primarily for students.  We take forty or so--forty to fifty kids on a big tour bus.
Speaker 1: And you go during the spring break?
Speaker 2: We try not to lose school days the most school days we lose is two.
Speaker 1: So is it in the spring or--(simultaneous) (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It's in January so it's sort of at the end of the second quarter and the beginning of the third quarter.  So there's a day or so in there that the kids don't come to school. It works out nicely.
Story_ID: 193100
Speaker 1: Well, what are some of your hopes and concerns for these students today?
Speaker 2: You mean for the tour or just for the kids in general?
Speaker 1: Just for the kids in general.
Speaker 2: Well I want them to learn how to read and write and cipher as we might say, you know.  That's it and I want to do what I can to help to do that.  You have to have a lot of energy and understanding.  I gave a test today to 150 kids and out of that 150 about five of them were so incorrigible that I just had to take their test papers and give them zero for the test.  Now I don't want to give them a zero, I don't want to put them out of the class, I can't teach them if they are put out.  So I'll try again and again and I will re-teach you see and if I can save another one well that's the way it is but you have to have that kind of stamina to withstand the situation and I guess I'm just lucky enough to have it.
Speaker 1: Has the teaching of chemistry changed much since you learned it back then?
Speaker 2: I don't think so, no.  It's not the chemistry that changes, it's the times.
Story_ID: 193101
Speaker 1: Well when you have a success at what you're trying to do when it's not anticipated, you see.  Now--it's now about ten years ago right here at Suitland [High School, Forestville, Maryland] that this young girl was not very good, put it like that.  Her sister's had already had babies and her brother wasn't going anywhere; she's the last child.  She has no right to amount to anything, you see.  But we established a program here which we call Cooperative Learning Center which meets after school, four days a week.  We brought her into the program and that's where we spent extra time tutoring, drilling and re-teaching.  She was able to finish here.  We got her a scholarship to go to Towson state college [later Towson University, Baltimore College, Maryland]--full paid scholarship.  One of the teachers here said we're just wasting the money on her, she'll never make it.  Well to make a long story short, she now has a master's degree in biology.  To be able to tell this and it's the truth and it makes us feel good.  That's not saying that everybody went that way but she would not have been able to go that way without our backing and staying after school, who would have thought of such a thing as that.  Why are you going to stay after school to teach some kids, why can't they get it during the regular class hours?  I don't know but I do know if we give them more drills, more time, we can get a few more to succeed and that's the--I guess that's the reward.
Speaker 2: Typically how many of your students go on to college?
Speaker 1: I have no idea but towards the end of the year when they post the thousands of dollars that these kids are offered, it's very impressive.  I don't know what it is.
Speaker 2: Okay sir you say children are--I mean the youth, I guess the students that you teach now are different from when you were coming along.
Speaker 1: Yes
Speaker 2: In what fundamental ways are they different?
Speaker 1: The kids are different in that their environments are different.  They still have the same brain but you got a different environment.  You now have children who are the parents of these children.  When I say the parents, their attitudes are different.  The drugs and stuff like that which are available, we didn't have that back there.  What we would do, we would get some corn silk and roll it up in a piece of paper and try to smoke it, not habit forming at all (laughter).
Story_ID: 193102
Speaker 1: I've read that you, in looking at the conditions that some of the pressures that are on youth today, you kind of--you feel that you have to take into consideration what some of these youth are going through as we--before we judge them, right?
Speaker 2: I think it would be very helpful if we just stopped before cutting them down and seeing what their situations are and if we knew these situations--like I mentioned this girl that we sent to Towson--if we knew these situations, I think we would be more inclined to try another time and another time or as we say seventy times seven.  Don't give up, it's tough.  It just might be that some chemist and geneticist might get together and come up with a drug, if you choose, that neutralizes these things which are doing the damage.  We just have to keep trying.
Story_ID: 193103
Speaker 1: Now do you have any observations on today's teachers.  You've been teaching for such a long time--over fifty years.  How have teachers changed?
Speaker 2: Well I don't want to say that teachers have changed.  Teaching through the years back there was known as an honored and respected poverty--that was the general expression for it; they weren't paid so much.  A person says well I'll finish college and then I'll try to get a job in an administrative office or something like that and if I can't get anything I'll teach.  It was considered as the last resort and it's unfortunate that that was the situation.  It really was an attitude towards teaching.  So I have seen all kinds of teachers, white and black you understand and they are alike pretty much.  The assortment is there.  If one is going to be a teacher and endeavors to understand why a child or person reacts in a certain manner that should be very helpful--to find out why.  Why did this young lady today when I say if you don't keep quiet, I'll have to take your paper, she says, "here," and handed me the paper.  That's another thing; I've got to solve that.  I don't know what she will say when she goes home.  A funny thing happened, the girl told me--she says, "Dr. Beale I'm going to have to move to another teacher's class, my mother wants me to move because she figures that a man ninety-one years old can't teach me anything (laughter)."  I had never heard that before but I thought that was unique; I'm passing it on.
Speaker 1: That's an interesting situation.
Speaker 2: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 1: It says something about values today, I guess.
Speaker 2: That's what the girl's mother said.  Of course, I'll be talking to the mother again and I'll be showing her something then maybe she will be able to spread it on a little further.
Story_ID: 193104
Speaker 1: How do you manage to have this kind of energy--the energy to teach now?  You hear people say and it's pretty much true that teaching is a rigorous profession.  You have to be mentally sharp--to do it right you have to be really on your toes, you have to work hard and focus.  How do you stay in condition for that or how do you explain being able to do that at age ninety-one?  Most people would have stopped like thirty years ago.
Speaker 2: If I may seem to brag a bit first of all you've got to understand, I know the stuff (laughter).  One day I was talking to this chemistry class and this young man sitting right there in the front row was paying no attention, in fact he was talking.  I said, "Mr. Smith you're not paying any attention to what I'm saying," he says, "Oh Dr. Beale I know the shit," and he did know the shit, he made As (laughter), I had to laugh at that.  There are those who know it and then of course those that don't know it you've got to get them to straighten up and fly right as the song used to go.  So I don't claim to be able to write a book, treatise or whatever on how to teach in these modern days.  I can only speak in generalities and that is don't give up, keep trying.  The person is a human being and others are working on theories and philosophies and we may come up with a solution but you don't give up.  Discoveries that I have read about that science didn't necessarily happen overnight.  I do remember when I was a kid playing in my backyard there in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], I discovered how to siphon water and I thought that was wonderful.  I could put water in this thing and set this hose up and it would run on over into the other thing.  I didn't know what was happening but you keep trying and something happens.
Story_ID: 193105
Speaker 1: Sir what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Hopes and concerns for my people as the monkey said one day (laughter) was the sum of my people were just acting up.  I'll tell you this one thing; this might give you some insight.  Now I'm here really as a role model that's why I came into this system.  So that the kids could see that a black male can amount to something.  Now I have seen--where was I--this had to be at College Park [Maryland] when I was teaching chemistry there because I had white and black students together and I saw this white boy and this black boy just wasting time.  Chat, chat, chat in my class so when I got an opportunity, I took the black boy aside and I said, "Look now you need to be careful, you and this white boy are here together, you're wasting, he's wasting time.  You're both going to finish here and then there will be a job.  He doesn't know any more than you do but when a decision is made, he's going to get the job, he's going to get the job. You'll still be out there with nothing.  You have to have more than he has."  Now I'm telling him this and the black people who are in a position to tell these things to the black students have to do this kind of thing instead of saying, "Oh I'm just ashamed of you and oh my people, my people you'll never amount to anything," and so forth.  That's not going to help.  You have simply got to get them aside and talk to them individually.  It would be nice if we had some white folks to go to the black folks and say, "Look you are wasting your time," tell them the same thing I said.  A white person is going to get this job even though you have more stuff than he has and we know that.  Now there was a time when I was growing up in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] there were certain jobs that were known as a white man's job.  They guy who drove the milk wagon and left the bottles of milk around the different places, the driver was white.  The guy, who went to read the meters in the houses, that was a white man's job, see.  There's a joke--you've probably heard the joke about the street cleaner in this city where horses did their duty as they walked along and there is a wagon and a white guy and a black guy.  The black guy would get down there and shovel up this horse manure, throw it up into the wagon, the white guy would take his shovel and just move it over.  That went on for a while until the white guy said look you get up here and move it over and let me get down there and shovel it up there 'cause I can't take no shit from a nigger (laughter).  That was his attitude.  But we've got to serious about this thing and just try to help each other.  Mordecai Johnson was the president of Howard University [Washington, D.C.] back there in the '30s [1930s] and he would speak to groups roundabout and when he spoke to a group of black students--college students he would tell them get your education and go south and help to educate the black people otherwise they weren't going to have any teachers and that's in me.  I have got to do what I can to help them.
Story_ID: 193106
Speaker 1: Sir at this juncture--now you're still going strong here, what would you consider your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh well I have so many nieces and nephews figuratively speaking who are doing well, you know, that's it.  The realization that I have helped these people along.  There's a girl right now--how old is she--let's go back if she was eighteen in '52 [1952] which is fifty-one so she's sixty-nine, right.  She's teaching in Los Angeles [California] who says she owes her whole life to me, you know and I say you know you've got to understand after all you did the work, you studied and so forth.  Yes but if you had not encouraged me to this, that and the other time I wouldn't be anywhere. She's had a wonderful life and there are a lots of such people.  So I just go on merrily along.
Story_ID: 193107
Speaker 1: There's a story you told during the break about being needed I guess.  There's a story about the little girl that you used to play with when you were a little boy and the kiss.  Can you tell that story?
Speaker 2: Oh that was just a practice that the little girl and I had.  We were only about eight or nine years old and she lived in the neighborhood and I guess she was my girlfriend, I guess, I don't know the case but we would kiss each evening when it was time to go in around nine o'clock or so and on this particular day she came to me and she says, "Bob my mother told me I have to come in early tonight so kiss me now (laughter) which of course I did and then she went merrily on home."
Speaker 1: That's just a story that illustrates that it's good to be needed, you know, or that you have something that people want.
Speaker 2: Yeah you have a role and there we are; a role model.  See that didn't occur to me that I'd be a role model here for fourteen years--twelve, thirteen years.  But it's been like that the whole time.
Story_ID: 193108
Speaker 1: Now after such a long and productive life, is there anything that you would have done differently?
Speaker 2: Well there's nothing so bad, so to speak, that I did.  I didn't make anybody--any girl pregnant (laughter).  If I had I would say gee, I would have done that thing different, I didn't do anything like that. I haven't stolen anything, I'll put it like this, I've worn out a few guardian angels.  In my gang of seven boys when I was about nine, ten years old in the neighborhood we used to roam around, of course we're all about the same age and we went pass a certain man's house who just didn't want us to walk on his sidewalk.  Every time we'd walk by there he would come to the door, get away from here and one day--now this is a guardian angel's thing you know--one day one of us got a bullet--a sure enough bullet and one of us got a hold of a gun and we put the bullet in the gun and we went on our trip around.  We got to this man's house and he came to the door, "Get away from here; get off of my sidewalk."  One of us--wasn't me--took that gun out and aimed it at him and shot.  The bullet was too big for the barrel of the gun and it didn't go and then of course, we ran.  I may have used up five guardian angels that time, you know because we could have killed the guy and he was scared to death because he was almost to death with one of us holding this gun out there.  Boy what do you think of that for a job of a guardian angel?
Speaker 1: You could have been in jail.
Speaker 2: Yes, criminal record and all that stuff you see.  So I would not have engaged in that kind of thing but then the kids as far as cussing was concerned they would say, "Excuse me Bob," and then go on and cuss (laughter).  I don't know why they did that.  They would gamble with their pennies and nickels.  Either toss them up against the wall or rolling dice and I would just look at them but never participated.  So maybe my angel was telling me you know don't do that.
Story_ID: 193109
Speaker 1: One last question, it's slightly different from legacy but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well as I've said as a person who will not give up, I'll keep trying and I'll even try to find out why something is not working.  That's the kind of guy I am and it has been the result of my accomplishing quite a few things to the appreciation of various people.  The whole school here celebrates my birthday.  Did you know that?  You come around here on November nineteenth and you will see four big sheet cakes available for students to come by and get a piece of cake in celebration of my birthday.  I was telling my wife the other day, I said, remember one year that the Spanish class came around there.  They had me seated out here in the lobby of the main building and I'm sitting there and the Spanish class comes in and sings to me, "Feliz Navidad, Felise Navidad [sic, Feliz Cumpleanos]" and I'm saying oh boy isn't this great (laughter).  They have done that for ten years.  I don't have anything to do with it, it's just that's the way they feel.  So just keep on keeping on as they say.
Speaker 1: Okay, thank you very much sir.
Speaker 2: My pleasure.
