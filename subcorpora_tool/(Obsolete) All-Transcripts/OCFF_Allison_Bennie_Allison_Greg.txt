 Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  Finchum  My name is Tanya Finchum, along with Juliana Nykolaiszyn. We   re with  the Oklahoma State University Library, and we   re here in Lawton,  Oklahoma at the Ben Allison Farm or just Allison Farm?  Either way.  With Ben and Greg Allison. This is in regards to our Centennial Farm  Families project. Thank you for having us today.  You   re welcome.  Let   s start by having you tell us what you know about how your family  came to have this particular piece of land.  My grandfather and grandmother Allison come to Lawton from  Pleasanton, Texas. He registered for the lottery. I   m not sure the exact  time frame on that, but he did register for the lottery. I don   t know  whether he stayed here for the lottery or he went back home. But  anyway, he made several trips from places in Texas to Lawton,  Oklahoma, moving and so on. Eventually, the whole family ended up  here.  And his first name was   ?  Kelsey.  Kelsey. K-E-L-S-E-Y?  I think that   s probably pretty close, K-E-L-S-E-Y.  Well, do you know about how far that is, from Pleasanton to here?  5  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  No. I would say from here to San Antone  San Antonio , the normal  drive is about eight hours in a vehicle, in today   s driving. So, in a  covered wagon their first time, I would presume     They would stay all night a time or two.     they would take, probably, five days, maybe? Dad has told me stories  that he   s always heard, probably, when they did win the lotto ticket on  the place that when they come up in the covered wagon with their  belongings and one cow?  I   m not sure of that.  Well, you go ahead and tell the story about the calf.  Well, some livestock anyway. But I   m sure he was by himself this  particular trip, and he was leading a cow. She had a young calf, I don   t  think on the way, but the calf was young when he left. He got to a point  and people began to run out in the street when he went through a little  town, waving for him to    Stop, stop, stop     He didn   t for a while, but he  finally stopped and people run out there and said,    You   re dragging your  calf. You   re killing your calf.    He said,    No, he   s all right,    and went  on. Well, I guess probably some got on horses and run him down. That  ole calf was just walking along there at a breezy pace. (Laughs) He  loved telling that story.  I guess the calf would be drug so far until it realized that it would have  to get up and follow.  Yes. It wasn   t hurting any. He wasn   t moving very fast at all.  Didn   t you always tell me and Cindy  Greg   s sister  that your dad, which  would be my grandfather, was about five years old     Six, I think.  Five or six whenever they come here.  He set foot on the place down here, first.  So your grandfather was already married at that time.  Yes, Kelsey was. Their oldest son come up with him at some point and  stayed. I guess, probably, after the lottery they had to have someone stay  on the farm right then or immediately after. He stayed here and I think in  the meantime, before they all got settled, he had married a neighbor lady  6  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  from on down the road here.  His name was Hugh Allison, and his descendants live on the quarter  right north of us here.  But it   s not the centennial farm.  How many acres was the initial   ?  160.  And it   s still all intact today?  Yes, still intact and still farmed.  By an Allison.  By an Allison. What did the first ones farm? What was their product or  produce?  You mean my grandpa?  Yes.  I   m not real sure, but I think probably some corn and cotton. It seemed  like this was pretty big cotton country at one time, real early. I don   t  know whether that   s just what they had been used to planting where they  lived or what, but they had a living. Sometimes I wonder how in the  world they done it, but     And how many children did they have?  Kelsey     Let   s see, there was three boys and I guess three girls.  Don   t look at me. (Laughter)  I   m just trying to     Yes, there was at least six of them.  How did it pass down?  Okay, I think the year was approximately 1926 or seven, along in that  time period. My grandparents apparently wanted to move to town, more  7  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  conveniences and so on. There was no water on that place at all and of  course, no electricity. They was elderly, getting elderly, and they wanted  to have a little more conveniences. So my folks, I guess, all along had  wanted to buy it when they wanted to get rid of it. So they managed to  buy it along in that time frame. They was the ones that built the part of  the house that   s there now, 1912. Well, I said,    26. Where did that come  from?  I don   t know.  Okay, maybe my grandparents did build the first part of that house. I  know they built the clapboard house first and then lived in it from, I  guess, 1901 or two up to the 1912. But then from 1912, I guess, they  lived there until, I   m pretty sure it was about    26.  Okay, it was just a what, a two-room?  It had four little rooms.  Four little rooms with a basement, and the kitchen was in the basement.  Yes.  Interesting.  And it still has the basement.  Dirt floor. That   s the main thing that   s wrong with the house was that  basement under it. It   s settled and leaked water, and it   s always been  kind of a mess.  It   s interesting that the kitchen was in the basement, though.  I can   t imagine it. (Laughs)  No. I wonder what their thinking was.  Heating. Part of it   s still   it   s got a bricked, probably, fire pit.  No, that was just brick. There was just a     That was just a column?  Yes, to hold the chimney.  Well, okay. But you know, the lower you build your heat, as it rises it  8  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  will warm the rest of the rooms.  Well, it done that, but there was never, as far as I know, a place to build  a fire in the fireplace down there.  Okay.  Did they have a large garden?  Yes.  Did a lot of canning?  Yes. Also, it was in the stipulations of the homestead that each  homestead had to plant so many trees, fruit trees, orchard   I said fruit  trees. It may have been nuts, I don   t know for sure. But there is one tree  still left down here of that original orchard. I think it may be dead after  last summer. We could have saved it, but you could see through it. I   m  surprised the wind hadn   t blowed it over.  It   s probably been hit with lightning too many times, because the trunk  is hollow. I think it   s still alive. It   s a peach tree, right?  No, pear.  Pear. They   re very durable trees.  Then the same thing, and I don   t quite understand it, because this was  never a homestead. This was school land, right here. Back to the west  here about a quarter of a mile, there was a house and a barn, and there  was an orchard there. I remember it was mostly fruit trees. I   m sure they  were pear because pears are pretty hearty and about the only thing that  would survive here without much water. I can remember picking up the  pears that had fallen off that tree. There was, probably, about three of  them there when I can remember. I dug up the last one here about twenty  years ago. (Laughs) It was in the way. It didn   t make any fruit anyway.  You said there wasn   t any water. What was their water source?  Barrels and go to the creek or something. Now, here, there was an  artesian well a mile north and two miles east. They used to haul  water .  I can remember seeing wagons and teams with wagons and barrels there  at that well. But it flowed. It was a flowing artesian well. It just sat there  with open pipes, flowing year round. You just drove in there, and I don   t  know how they drove the horses through it, but they   d drive them near  through it, fill up their barrels or whatever they had, and leave.  9  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  I can remember one morning, I went with my dad in a    35 Ford pickup  and he had a tank that fit in the back about right   on some skids.  (Gestures) He   d load it up. He could load it by himself, it was a pretty  light gauge metal, and go over there and get water. We went over there  one time and it was icy. Where they pulled under the spigot or the spout,  the downspout to fill, they   d pile rock and concrete and so on in there to  keep from getting stuck. Of course, that ice froze on them rock so it was  slick as it could be. I can remember my dad got up in there where he  needed to be and filled the tank full. We had had to sit in line probably  close to an hour to get water. When he went to pull out, it spun and he  probably backed up and give it a little run. The tank went out of the back  of the pickup and dumped the water. (Laughs) So, we had to put the tank  back in the pickup and go around to the end of the line and start over.  Then we finally, after we got electricity, they knew of some wet spots  over here in the pasture, springs. We dug out one, or they did, dug out  one spring. It didn   t furnish much water at all, enough to drink and flush  the stool, if you didn   t do it too often. That was right after we got  electricity, and I think that was probably in about    47 or eight. That was  the first electricity that was on that place. So, we piped water to the  house. Later, seeing it wasn   t going to furnish enough, we went down on  a little farther down on the creek and dug out a well. It was a real good  well, but it had the old steel, oil field pipe for a casing, and the  perforations rusted shut. That shut it off. So, we drilled another one there  pretty close to it. Same thing there, we had good water there for eight or  ten years, maybe a little longer than that. Anyways, we   re on the fourth  one now, but we put PVC casing in it, and it won   t do that. So, it   s a  good well.  It   s been there   I remember when I was still in high school or right out  of high school, and I graduated in    80. I   m thinking I was still in school  when they dug it so it   s thirty plus years old. And through all the  droughty weather we   ve had, it has never went dry. I tried to keep all of  our trees alive with it this last summer.  That takes quite a bit of water.  How long has the cistern been across the road?  I don   t have no idea, there.  It was hand dug.  It had to have been soon after they built that little house.  10  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  It is brick lined. Yes, on the north side of the house, there is a cistern and  that   s where they stored their water. Our rain water off from the house  would flow into it. Before y   all got electricity, y   all had gas lights.  Yes. I don   t remember what the gas company   s name was, Consolidated  or   I   m not even sure. They come through from a gas field. Do you  know where Hulen is? Probably not. It   s over here on Highway-65.  Hulen is six miles south. Then this gas field was another four or five  miles south of there. But there was a lot of gas there at that time. Lawton  didn   t have gas so they piped gas from there into Lawton. The main  come through that quarter there. They got free gas, period. They had gas  lights, which was plenty good to read newspaper by or whatever. Had  water heaters, if you had water pressure and so on, you know, running  water.  After a period of years, I   m not sure how many, probably fifteen or  twenty years, we got notice that they was going to have to start charging  some. I can understand why, because people would get a leak in their  service lines, in their meter to the house. I guess there wasn   t any  meters. Anyway, they was wasting too much gas. So, they thought,     Well, if we charge them for it, maybe they won   t waste as much,     which I   m sure is right. But it went up there two or three times. I can  remember when I was, probably, just out of high school or maybe still a  senior or something in high school, got a letter that they had went to the  Corporation Commission and declared all them contracts null and void.  So, they would pay at the same rate, I guess, they do in town.  Did they get any money or income from it going through the land?  I think that was part of the gas company   s     Free gas.     for the easement right-of-way was to provide free gas to the  landowners.  We was afraid a time or two, they got to having a lot of leaks on that  main line. Everybody was scared they would probably do away with it  because this gas field had run out of gas. We was afraid that they would  just do away with that line. Well, no, they had run a line from there to  Temple so they had to furnish Temple gas. So, they brought gas in out of  Lawton and sent it that way. It   s still that way.  Was the house heated with it?  Oh, yes. Yes, had a big ole style circulating heater, a big square heater. It  11  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  sat down in the central part of the house, and it wouldn   t warm the  whole house, but it would warm this one big room that was the main  living room. It would warm it. There was usually enough heat in the  kitchen from the cooking and so on. Then the bedrooms, two of the  bedrooms was just off that room. My mother always shut her door to her  bedroom because she didn   t want any heat. None at all. It would get cold  in there. But the other two bedrooms, you could leave the door open and  they would stay pretty warm.  And were any of those downstairs or was it just the kitchen?  No, just     The only thing downstairs was the kitchen?  Well, that was that at first. Probably going to have to backup here at  some point. After my mother and dad bought the place, they added about  the same dimensions that it was onto the east of it, and that was a  kitchen and a bedroom and you could call it a porch, but actually it was  her butter room. I had mentioned that she made homemade country  butter. They milked anywhere from twelve to twenty-eight cows for, I   m  going to say, probably fifty years, at least. She   d get up every morning  about somewhere between four-thirty and five-thirty and start getting her  cream ready to churn. Sometimes it would wake me up, but usually it  didn   t even bother me. She would do her churning of the butter and  molding of the butter and everything. Then she would wake my dad up  and me and my sister to get up and eat breakfast and get ready for  school. I usually had quite a few chores to do. By that time, I had some  show pigs, and so on, that I had to get out and feed.  That churn she had, it was a big ole barrel, wasn   t it?  Yes.  In earlier life, before electricity, how was it powered?  By a gasoline motor.  Was the motor outside or inside?  No, it was inside there about where the stool is now. It sat on a little  platform, there.  And she had     A line shaft. You could run several things off of one motor.  12  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  He mentioned the butter mold. My sister has it, and she had cartons. I  don   t know if I can find them, but she had cartons printed up and they  was a one pound carton, and that helped subsidize     Yes, through the Depression that was        through the Depression, their living, her selling butter uptown. But the  carton always got me. I mean, it was a beautiful blue and white kind of  like your plates are, with a cow and atmosphere in the back and then on  one side it said Avice Allison   was it   ?  Mrs. Frank Allison     An address and     Phone number I think. It might   ve not been a phone number. I can still  remember the phone number from back then, just an old party line.  Somebody would hear it ring, they   d go eavesdrop.  Do you remember how many rings your ring was?  Yes, the last two numbers was 2-1. It was two long and a short, 95-  10F21. Now, the rest of my memory is bad. (Laughter)  So, when your parents took over the farm, can you talk us through the  layout of the farm at that time? Barns and ponds and such.  If you would get that picture, somebody right there. (Gestures)  Well, right up there on the wall     Yes, I know, but I need that picture. Okay, he spoke of the cistern, which  is still there.  But it was on the opposite side of that house, wasn   t it?  Yes. Normally, the cistern is close to a door where it was handy. Part of  this, I   m kind of speculating. I   m pretty sure it was right outside of the  south door. That might have been three or four foot or it might have  been ten or fifteen feet, I   m not sure of that. It   s still there. So, then in  19   whenever my grandparents built this house, they built it to where it  made the cistern on the north side of the house. Another reason they  used to do that was so they could put the gutters on the house and have a  downspout to run water into the cistern.  13  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  Then this barn, here, when they built the brick house they moved this  house here down, right to the east, or to the left, of this barn here and left  a driveway where you could drive through. (Gestures) That was a  combination of granary, milk barn, and shed. There was a long shed here  for cattle to get out of the weather. (Gestures)That   s kind of the  arrangement of the homestead itself. Of course, they built a chicken  house out here somewhere, an outdoor toilet, and that kind of stuff. But  this was the main layout of the house and barn.  This is my grandfather, my dad, my brother, and his daughter. (Gestures)  But the farm part, there was a small field, nine acres south of here a half  a mile or almost half a mile. It   s got a kind of flat hilltop there that they  broke out the sod and planted some kind of crop there, I   m not sure  what. The same thing over in the northeast corner of the quarter, they  broke out about that much there for oats. Oats used to be a main crop so  they could feed the horses and cattle if need be and so on.  Another thing here, when they first come up here, the whole family, they  had all their cattle. I don   t know whether it was five or six head or ten or  twelve or what it was, but that was part of my dad and his two brothers     job every day, was to find them cows, because it was no fence. No fence  whatsoever. They hadn   t got around to building that, yet. So, they   d find  them cows, make sure they hadn   t strayed away, which I don   t think  they was going to leave. He said the grass was so tall, the blue stem  grass, that they had to ride pretty well up on a cow before they could see  her, if she was laying down especially. It   s a far cry from what it is now.  (Laughs) Now, it   s about like this tabletop.  Tell them about what Grandpa used to say, your dad, when he was a kid  about the trees on Cash Lake.  Yes, this is a little bit hazy looking, but it looks like you might can see  some trees right there in the horizon down here on this creek. Now, you  can   t see across the creek because there   s trees, it   s all trees. I asked my  dad not that many years before he passed away, I said,    How come  there   s   you say there was no trees and there   s no trees showing in that  picture?    He said,    No, there   s no trees.    I said,    Well, what about Cash  Creek?    this big creek right back west here. He said,    No, there was a  few big old trees, but there was no smaller younger trees or brush or  anything like that.    I said,    How come?    He said,    The longhorns, the  buffalo and the deer and wildlife kept it all eat off,    anything green as  far as on them creeks. I guess they must not have liked blue stem. There  was more of it than they could eat, I   m sure, but they   d concentrate on  them creeks where they had water, and they   d eat all of the young trees.  How could they tell which cows were theirs or which ones weren   t back  14  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  in those days?  Oh, they called them by name. (Laughter) I   m not sure of that. I don   t  think they branded them, then. They could   ve cut notches in their ear or  something.  Do you know how they actually moved, physically moved, the house?  Probably on some telephone poles, or they might have cut some trees.  Well, there wasn   t no trees. Probably a telephone pole, two telephone  poles and jack it up and slide them poles under it and let down on it,  hook up two or three teams on it and drag it.  Now, what year would that have been?  It would have been after 1912.  Did they have phone or electric poles, then?  Oh, yes, they had telephone poles. I   m not sure when the telephone  come to happen, but the telephone lines were owned by the customers  and they had to maintain them. So, if they had a big storm that broke  bunch of poles off there, they had to go muster up some more poles and  put it back up. Another thing on them, they wasn   t very high off the  ground. My dad had bought a combine in the    30s, probably lower    30s  to    35, six, seven, eight   a combine, pretty good, tall combine. It used to  be my job, I was little then, to get up in the grain bin and when they   d  have to go under one of these telephone lines to get a hold of it, raise it  up, over whatever it was hanging on. And if somebody turned that crank,  it would really shock you. (Laughs) It wouldn   t hurt you, but it was quite  a shock.  What were some of your other chores? Chickens?  Yes, cleaning the chicken house. That was just about an every Saturday  job. Of course, my sister was supposed to help me, but we   d usually end  up getting in a fuss or something. My mother would say,    Y   all, one of  you come in the house,    and it   d usually be her. She put all the chicken  litter out on her garden, and she used to have the most beautiful garden  you could imagine. And most of this was after we got the running water.  Of course, she would carry her wash water from wherever she had her  washing machine sitting out to the little trees and garden and so on.  I   m sure it would sound funny to some people. We grew up there during  the Depression, but my sister and I didn   t   I   m not going to say we  were spoiled, by a long shot   but we never really realized that we didn   t  15  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  have everything we needed, if you know what I   m saying. She had to go  to town at least once a week to take her butter to where they had cold  storage, refrigeration. We   d end up going to town at least, I think, twice  a week, she   d have to take the butter because it wouldn   t keep for a  week. We   d end up, then, going to a movie in the afternoon. We used to  get popcorn. That was kind of a treat in them days.  Now, this is my uncle, I think, that got married, possibly about the time  this house was built, or it could have been a little bit before that house  was even built. (Gestures) They had twelve kids, I think. This is my dad,  I think, here. It don   t look like him, but in the size, age, it would have to  be. This is one of my uncles, there. This would be one of my aunts, but I  don   t remember for sure who was oldest. (Gestures)  Don   t look at me. I don   t know. I can   t honestly say. Goldie is the only  one I know, and I don   t know if she was even born, then.  I don   t think she was.  So, the other ones, I barely remember Hugh and he was the oldest.  This would have been my Aunt Lily. (Gestures)  How much older was Hugh than Grandpa?  Well, you can kind of see by their size. I   m sure this is Grandpa and this  is Hugh so probably ten years at least, or about. But it kind of fascinates  me, the chickens and maybe turkeys.  These would be chickens, looks like.  Then down here, the machinery, I never really tried to figure out what  that was, but one of them looks like a hack. It was kind of like a buggy,  it had a top on it and I think two seats. Then this is a rake and this is a  mower, and one of the work horses standing there and another one over  here. (Gestures) That was kind of amazing, there.  Tell her about Grandpa used to plant. He   d carry, what, a bushel of  wheat on his shoulder out to the   ?  Yes.  This was in the fall time. Probably fall come in early and a real rainy  season. I don   t know. Was it on the home place or right out here?  Right here.  16  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  On this school quarter     Yes, there was a gate right down the road here, about a block or a little  over, on each side of the road. You   d open both of them gates and drive  cattle back and forth across or take the machinery across, and so on. He  would just unhook from the drill when it     Horses, a team of horses.     started raining, he   d unhook, take the horses across the road. Then  when it dried up enough that he could sow, he would put a sack full of  wheat on his shoulder and take the horses back to the drill and the wheat  back to the drill and look up, and he said he might go one round or he  might go several rounds, and it   d rain again. But that was the way it was.  He began to rent more land, then, I guess right at the end of World War  II. The only time he ever worked off of the farm   well, it was at least  two times. One time was driving a taxi cab, I guess during World War I.  He must not have been quite old enough to have been in World War I. I  think all it consisted of was driving from Lawton to Fort Sill and back.  He got a little bit of pay out of that. Then he, later, after the Depression  was all over and everything, he went to work for the county grading  roads and building ponds. That was kind of where he began to buy a  little bit more and better equipment. I think he had enough money to buy  a new pickup.  Do you remember his first tractor?  No. I remember the second one, but I don   t remember the first one.  What about the first time you drove one?  Well, just like yesterday. (Laughs) There   s a field over here a mile east,  a place Dad rented and was cutting and combining wheat with this old  combine I was talking about. My brother was driving the tractor, and my  dad was running the combine and I was along. My brother, I don   t know  when it started, but he informed my dad that he had a date, a Saturday  night date. Of course, my dad said,    Well, Son, we just got started  combining. Sure need to keep going.    My brother didn   t like that. He  wasn   t a farmer, really. That   s this fellow right here. (Gestures) He   s  deceased now.  So, finally after they kind of argued back and forth a little bit, he turned  around and looked at me and said,    Son, can you drive that tractor?        Yeah  Yeah  Yeah     (Laughs) So, he was just like from you to the wall,  17  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  from me. In other words, he could have stepped up there to me, or  something, if I got in trouble or hollered at me, either one or something.  That might have made it worse, if he   d hollered. That was my first  driving a tractor with nobody else on the tractor.  Then shortly after that, I done pretty good, I guess, driving the combine,  so he took me over on that same place to another field to plow, the same  ole tractor. He got me lined out there to plow, and he went two or three  rounds with me watching him. Then he went a round or so of him  watching me, with plenty of room on the ole tractor to sit or stand. He  said,    Well, I   m going to go.    He was plowing in another field with  another tractor, but it was about half a mile or more away. He said,     Now, Son, if you kill this ole tractor, you   re going to have to walk to  me because you cannot crank it.    It was one of them you had to crank by  hand.  What model tractor?  D.  B?  D.  D.  Biggest tractor John Deere made at the time.  Okay.  So, I plowed and I don   t remember having   I might not have made as  pretty of corners as he would have liked to have had, but I made it  through the day and didn   t kill the tractor. After that, it was an everyday  deal. (Laughter)  You wish you hadn   t volunteered, then.  Almost. (Laughter)  Well, did you have to get up early and help milk, since your mother  made so much butter?  No. I had quite a few outside chores that I would do while they were still  milking the cows. My mother would go down to the dairy barn and help  him do the milking. Now, if something come up that they needed me, if  one of them was sick or something like that. My dad used to go deer  18  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  hunting in Colorado there every year for a number of years. It was all me  and my mother then. We would do the milking of the cows and the  feeding of the cows. She would clean up the dairy utensils and all that.  Then it   s off to school. Got along fine.  Then come home and do it all over again?  Yes, that   s about what it amounted to. I always kind of felt sorry for my  dad after I realized kind of what farming was. He would have to quit  way before dark and go in to milk the cows. It was still way after dark  when he   d get in the house. I always kind of felt sorry for him, because  he loved to farm. He   d be doing something in the field that was kind of  critical, and he   d have to quit and go milk the cows. He knew that was  his bread and butter, so     How long did they do the dairy, as their income?  About fifty years, forty or fifty years.  So they went through the hand milking to the     Yes. I don   t know whether he was that mechanically talented or what,  but I guess he bought one of the first milking machines. It was a Ford. It  had nothing to do with Ford Motor Company, but it was a Ford milker.  It had these little brass tubes with a piston in it. It went back and forth,  that causes the vacuum. They run it with a stationary gasoline motor. I  remember a belt went up through the ceiling to what   s called a pump  jack. That   d turn this mechanism that made a board, about a two-by-two  square, go back and forth. That   s what worked these pumps. It was a  good milker. It may have been hard on the cows. I don   t know that part.  It wasn   t timed like they are now. It was either just pulling or pushing,  one of the two. It was a whole lot better than milking by hand. We used  to, of course, have to milk by hand when the electricity was off and that  was pretty regular when they first put in all these hundreds of miles of  lines. But we lived through it. Wouldn   t take anything for them days, but  I wouldn   t pay a whole lot to go through them again. (Laughs)  Well, federal regulations probably impacted some of that, too?  No.  No?  There was no regulations, then, on     With the dairy? Or maybe they got out of it before that started?  19  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  Yes. I mean, they come in first with just your straight milk. It had to be  pasteurized. Then they   d have to add more to it until finally it was where  an inspector would come and inspect your dairy for cleanliness and so  on. But on the selling the cream and or selling the butter     Yes, see, they never sold the milk. They just milked the cows for the  cream.  Oh, okay.  But they done that so she   d have the cream to make the butter. Another  thing, if the electricity was off, even in the later years, it was usually my  job to sit there and turn the cream separator to separate the cream.  With her having spent most of her time doing that, did she belong to any  home demonstration clubs?  Yes. (Laughs) I suppose that was for everybody and it pretty much was  back then, you know, the country people. Yes, she used to have the club  meetings at her house and just make the rounds where they   d have the  meetings. It was a pretty big deal. I have a quilt that I won up here at the  schoolhouse. I don   t remember what the occasion was. It was probably a  fundraiser or some kind of box supper or pie supper or something. They  had a drawing then on this quilt, and I won that quilt. I think it   s down  here in the closet.  That would have been back in the    50s,    60s?  No, it was further than that. Probably in the    40s.  So, did the Home-Ec club make it?  Yes, I   m sure they did or maybe they just   there really wasn   t much  separating them, because pretty well everybody of that age and married,  and so on, belonged to the club, home economics club. I can remember  when they had to change the name. Government made them change the  name someway, because there was no club involved. I mean, they could  have probably left it a club, but they   d have a lot more regulations or  something on it. Home economics group, I think it was. Yes, by that.  Were you in 4-H or FFA?  Oh, yes.  4-H.  20  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  I couldn   t join until I was eight. The same school term I become eight  years old, my dad let me buy, or had the county agent that was in charge  of us buy me, a real good Duroc gilt. I think she come from Elk City or  somewhere like that. I could show her, but I couldn   t get the prize  money or the ribbon or anything for her. But I could show her, and I did,  and she got first place, but I didn   t get anything out of it except the  experience.  Well, how come?  Because I wasn   t old enough, or I hadn   t had it for a year. I was eight  years old, but you had to have your project for a year or something to  that effect.  Well, where   d you go to school?  Flower Mound, a mile north here.  Why don   t you tell them a little bit about that, Grandpa and     Well, there   s some pictures over there.  Yes.  Yes, my dad, he started to school     Tell them   your dad or Kelsey?  No, Kelsey didn   t go to school here.  Okay, tell them how   I   ve always asked y   all how they came up with  the name Flower Mound?  I   ve heard so many different stories on that, I   m not quite sure of it. Do  you?  No. I   ve just heard you preaching about a mound there with flowers on  it, and they was trying to come up with a name.  That was it. It wasn   t anyone, I don   t think, in the community. It could  have been.  That   s close enough to walk back and forth?  He rode his pony.  21  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Rode his pony?  I didn   t have time to walk. (Laughs)  And it was just tied up outside and ride it back home?  No. We had a horse barn, shed. I   d go in there and tie him up, go out at  recess and talk to him and so on. I always remember the boards. They  had kind of stalls fixed for them. They had big two-by-twelve plank  boards to separate it. There was something about them boards horses  liked to eat on. They would eat them boards plum in two sometimes. I   m  sure they were deficient on some mineral or something like that.  Well, what would you pack for lunch or take for lunch?  Probably a   that   s where the     Yes, go ahead.     sausage sandwich. Mother would fry sausage, cook sausage in the  morning and that was me and my sister   s lunch then. Sometimes it was  bologna, which I still like bologna, and usually a cupcake. I don   t really  remember any potato chips or anything like that. I think she must have  knew about the health food back then. (Laughs) Of course, the sausage  wasn   t real  healthy with  all that grease.  But you worked it off in those days.  Yes.  Okay, I   ve got a picture. I can   t find it though. This is the original school  that was here. (Gestures) It   s not at the location at the school. Actually,  the school is still around. It   s on the quarter across the road, just right up  here. His cousin, her and her husband, bought the old school  House.     house. When was that, the school, the new one built?  I was in the Army, overseas.  That would have been        55, somewhere along in there.  22  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum     55. Okay, they didn   t know what to do with the old school so his  cousin   or did Hugh buy it?  No, Uncle Hugh bought it.  Okay, his uncle bought it, and it   s still up here. This is where they was  placing it, beside their old house. (Gestures) They lived in it for up until,  what, forty years ago?  Might not have been that long.  This picture here, it   s a background. I mean, you can   t   this is where it  was originally sitting up there where Flower Mound School is now.  (Gestures)  This is a non-denominational Sunday school. That   s where I went to   I  can say any church I had was there.  Okay, now, let me find this other picture.  Was it a one-room school when you went?  Yes, one room, one teacher.  About how many children?  Forty-five.  Grades?  Eight.  One through eight?  Was it one room or two rooms?  No, it was one-room.  Well, when I went there, it was two rooms. It had a partition between it.  A curtain.  First, second, and third was in one room and fourth, fifth, and sixth was  in the other, right here. (Gestures)  So you went to the same actual building?  23  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Yes.  My dad, my brother and sister     This is it right here. (Gestures) This was right shortly after it was built.  That part with the arches and bell, it   s still there. But they have added so  much to it.  That   s the one we passed coming in.  Yes.  Did you notice the cemetery?  Yes.  That was formed after the school was   actually, after the school was  built. The person that lived there on that quarter of land, they lived on  further east, had, I think, either an infant or real young     I always thought the cemetery was built before the school.  No. Another thing, the original school that was built there   and I   m not  sure if that was 1901, two, or three, right in that area   they was fixing to  have a Christmas program at night, and the school burned before they  got there. They practiced and everything and put up decorations and  went home. After they went home and come back, it was burning. A lot  of people think it was probably   I don   t know whether they had candles  on the tree, surely not. But the schoolhouse burned down. I said,    Well,  what did y   all do about school, then?    They said,    We built another  one.     Okay, the one that   s there now is actually the third one?  Yes.  Okay. But that   s the one you went to school in, right?  Yes.  Okay, that   s why it was one room. That   s the difference. I went to the  one that I showed you a while ago that was freshly built and it was a  two-room.  Yes, but it was still just a curtain that was drawn.  24  G. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  It   s concrete. Here   s pictures of across the road. That was out-buildings  back when his dad was pretty, pretty prosperous in his farming  operation.  How many acres were you all farming at that time, your father?  I hadn   t counted it up     Because it was way more than the 160.  Oh, yes.  When did y   all acquire the 120?  World War II, probably the beginning of World War II. Now, that  wasn   t when he bought it, but that   s when he started farming it.  Okay, did he have any other places up along Cash Creek?  Yes, he had the Vandemark place, the Murphy place, and the Whitmore  place and eighty acres of the Merritt place across the road.  Would y   all have people help with the farming?  No. Maybe haul hay. Of course, the threshing because there wasn   t that  many combines then. And the threshing machine belonged to my uncle  who lived right next door, here. He never did have a tractor enough to  run it very good. My dad acquired a good tractor, better tractor, I should  say. But anyway, that was a crew. There was probably twenty to twenty-five  people that would go around to this neighborhood doing the  threshing.  Now, in them pictures, another big thing besides wheat harvest was  silage feed. In them pictures is a ground-dug silage pit that was on this  quarter across the road. Them pictures are where all the neighbors cut  and hauled silage together. They   d just go from one farmer   s place to  another. How long would that last?  Oh, usually not over three weeks at the most.  And would your mother have to cook for the crew?  When they were on our property.  There was another school in this area called Woodlawn. This is it right  25  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  here. (Gestures) The reason they closed the doors on it was because it  was a lack of students to keep it open.  Yes.  From this quarter, it would have been a mile and a half south. So,  basically, from Flower Mound School they was only two and a half  miles apart. That   s not very far apart.  Not very far. And to have that many students in    45.  Well, it was, I think, every three miles was denoted for the school. I  always wondered why there wasn   t a schoolhouse on every school  quarter. See, this quarter here is a school quarter. There was never a  school on this.  Was it possibly because Flower Mound School was out there?  Well, no, those was up there, if you could count back, those up there on  Bishop Road are, I think it   s every three miles or something close to  that. Something else I hadn   t said, and it doesn   t really pertain to this  exactly, but where this house is sitting I had bought from the school land  department way back when my wife and I first married. The rest of it,  we farmed. But since then, we kind of decided     Well, since here about ten years ago, the city of Lawton come in and had  their version of what they wanted. They outbid us on the school land,  which that   s what it   s for. It goes to the highest bidder. And they bid it  so high that there was no way we could afford to rent it to farm it  because it wouldn   t have paid for itself. Their thoughts of getting it was  to build an eighteen-hole golf course. Where they was going to get the  water to irrigate it, just in the last five years, they built a new freshwater  treatment plant. It   s on this school section, but it   s a quarter west here.  That all happened about the same time.  They was going to use the wastewater from the plant to irrigate the  eighteen-hole golf course. All the golf course facilities within the area  got it stopped.  Well, there was enough of them, they didn   t need it.  It was just one of them deals. And then after that, we   ve kind of lost  interest in it. It really is not that good of a farm, and we knew that we  would have a lot of what I call city farmers coming out here wanting to,  as a hobby, raise cattle or whatever. A neighbor of ours that   s pretty  26  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  prosperous, he   s got it now, and he farms it.  Well, he had the lease next to it.  But this school quarter was in     Allison     Farmed by the Allisons since     1912.     1912 up until probably twelve, fifteen years ago.  So, when your parents were finished farming, it came to you?  No. At some point   well, it   s while I was in the Army   my dad, I don   t  know what his age was then, he was at least seventy, but his health was  beginning to slow him up, and I was over in Germany. My mother wrote  me a letter and asked what my intentions were when I got out. I said,     Well, I want to farm.    She said,    Okay,    and said,    We were just  wondering. Your daddy   s going to have to slow up here soon. There   s a  place that we had farmed for years for sale, and he was wondering about  whether y   all should buy it.    And I wrote back and I told her,    Yes,    that  I definitely wanted to farm.  So, when I got back then, we didn   t divide everything right down the  middle or anything like that. It was just like this. Now, the cattle is about  the only thing that we did kind of split fifty-fifty. When he   d sell a calf  crop off of it, half of it was mine and half of it was his. I give him my  half until it amounted to kind of a set price they had on the cows. Then  the machinery, I had a little bit of machinery. He had what more we  needed, and then we farmed that way for eight or ten years   ten years,  probably. In the meantime, I had bought a backhoe, the third one in  southwest Oklahoma. I had a lot of work, a lot of business, but that  wasn   t what I wanted. I wanted to farm. So, then my dad got to where he  couldn   t do all the farming so I just quit the contracting business and got  my equipment and come back home. The farm prospered about that  time. Of course, there was two of us working it, where it wasn   t just  him.  And the times were changing, too, about that time.  Right. Right.  So, you lived here, you and your wife?  27  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Yes.  So, Greg, you would have been   well, not born in this house, but you  came back to this house after you     Yes. Yes. Still here.  And his sister.  What were you farming at that point? Wheat?  It was pretty diversified. It was wheat and probably some oats still at  that time. Alfalfa hay, and milo. Do you know what that is?  Yes.  Quite a bit of milo. So it was kind of diversified.  No milking cows for you?  No.  Now, they did on up until they couldn   t. They wanted to know if I  wanted to take it over and I said,    No, no, I don   t think so.     Well, did you have to have hired help to do yours?  No.  I guess that   s what Greg was for, huh?  Yes. (Laughter)  Yes, and there has never been any hired help on the Allison farm. Even  today, I don   t have hired help.  My wife, she was half-owner of a dairy three miles west, over here on  the highway.  Known dairy family, I guess when she had that along with her brother     her and one brother and then another, they had two dairies and they sold  milk to the public.  Drive in there in your car and fill up your jug and go home.  28  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  So after her and Dad married, she didn   t want no more dairying.  Well, she didn   t say that. She said,    Do you want to keep the dairy? Do  you want to work the dairy?       No, thank you.    So, she sold out and  followed me. I don   t think she was ever sorry.  So, Greg, what were some of your chores?  Well     He had show animals.  We never had no chickens up here. When I was young my grandfather  was still living and still pretty active, somewhat, even though Dad was  pretty much the head farmer, then. I didn   t have that many chores. It was  probably later in my life that I learned to drive and operate the  machinery, because my grandfather was still able to. And anytime  something would come about, he was always wanting to do it. Now, he  was a whole lot older and he had slowed up a lot, but it was hard for me  to understand his passion to farm. Here I   m a young kid coming about,  wanting to learn how to drive a tractor, because that   s all exciting. It  took me a long time to understand why it was hard for him to give it up.  When he finally give in, I could tell he was hurt very deeply that, I  guess, in a way I was replacing him. It really wasn   t that way. It was  just     He was beyond     I was more older in life learning how to drive a tractor than my dad was.  One reason was my grandfather just didn   t want to give it up. I didn   t  understand it for a long time, but I do nowadays. I guess my chores  when I was in grade school, probably one of our biggest cash crops  besides wheat was alfalfa hay. That   s what I specialize in now is raising  and selling alfalfa hay to the public, which his dad and he did also. A lot  of our neighbors around here, their alfalfa hay was grown for their own  livestock, which we   ve always had livestock, but not in the abundance  like our neighbors have.  Some of them had dairies.  When I was in grade school, he built a hay truck to haul the small square  bales on. I was too young to physically last all day handling each bale.  So, it was Dad and a neighbor fellow that was probably about twelve  years older than me that physically handled the hay, and I had to drive  the truck in the field. But then when we got to the barn, they would get  up in the barn to stack the hay, and I would have to manage to pull these  29  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  hay stacks. They was stacked four bales high on this truck. I remember it  was all I could do to pull them bales down and lift them a couple inches  off the floor and put on this conveyer chain to stick them on up into the  barn. I hated it for the longest, because it was hard work.  I finally got to where I was enjoying it some. Then in later years, as time  goes by, it was harder to find people that wanted to physically do  physical labor. That was getting in the time where he was starting to  retire or almost retired and I started taking over. I basically needed to  realize some means of handling our alfalfa growth crops without using a  whole lot of labor to do it. That   s when I diversified and bought some  different hay equipment, which consisted of a bigger type of baler. And  now, I let the bigger tractor loaders do all the handling.  Round bales, now?  Square bales, the bigger square bales. But actually, when I was a kid, I  didn   t have chores like he did, because the chickens and cattle was  across the road at Grandpa and Grandma   s house. When I was real  young, me and my sister used to go collect the eggs, but it always  bothered me. Seemed like once a week we   d go in there and there   d be a  bull snake. I do not like snakes. I   d hurt myself trying to get out of there.  Well, don   t forget your show pigs. You had them.  I had show pigs.  4-H, too?  No, I was never in 4-H. It was FFA. Done well with them. Probably  could have done exceptionally well with them if I had a little more  experience being a showman. I was lacking showmanship, but as far as  taking care of the animals and keeping them healthy and having the  proper ones to impress the judges, I did well there.  His mother kept him occupied, I guess I could say, in grade school pretty  much, wrestling. Was you ever on honor roll?  No, I never liked school. I always wanted to be out on the farm.  So, was it a hard decision deciding to retire?  No, I had to.  In    92 he had a heart attack, and he was still farming then.  30  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Then I had a heart valve replaced, open heart surgery.  I guess it was in   92, he had the heart attack. In 2000 he had open heart  surgery. He had a valve replacement. But in that time, I   m thinking   my  mom passed away in    03. We took care of her for five or six years. So,  in probably    96 or    97, she started getting sick. We took her to a lot of  different doctors and     They was real slow to diagnose it.  One doctor, and it really hurt matters as far as trying to take out  insurance for her. They had wrote on her medical records,     Alzheimer   s,    but she never had Alzheimer   s. She had mini-strokes.  It caused dementia.  That   s what she died from was mini-strokes. Mom was a very proud  person, a very hardworking person. She was a professional cook for her  whole life. Her last cooking job was up here at Flower Mound School.  She fed up to 150 kids, and she had one helper. Every day for lunch,  they had hot dinner rolls. She was a hardworking woman. She had a big  garden, too. We always suspected that she possibly had some heat  strokes working the garden. Later in life, she started having the mini-strokes,  but that   s what she died from. She asked me and made me  promise her that we   d never put her in a rest home. I made that promise.  So, her working, she helped supplement the income for the family, too,  then.  Oh, yes.  Did you have another job besides the farm?  The backhoe.  Oh, yes, and you switched.  Yes, and I got hurt doing that. A pipe fell off of the bank down in a ditch  and hit me in the back. Later on, I don   t know how many years it was,  six, eight, maybe ten years, I had to have back surgery. That is why I  can   t walk, now. I mean, it rubbed on my spinal cord, the rotary.  Well, back up there. The surgery that you had, that fixed that problem,  but he   s got irreversible nerve damage in his low     My feet and legs.  31  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  B. Allison  They couldn   t fix that problem. I mean, both of them was back  problems. They could fix one, but they couldn   t fix the other. That   s  why he   s not very   he can   t get around very well.  There   s nerve damage to my spinal cord. My feet started getting numb,  and then it started up my leg. It was almost to my knee when I finally  got an appointment and got in to see a doctor. He said,    Well, if you  don   t have this surgery, you   ll be in a wheelchair        Within a year.  Yes, or less. I went ahead and was able to get around and work quite a  long time after that, but I   ve got arthritis real bad. The combination of all  that    Another thing kind of interesting here, you always heard about  the school kids getting out to pick cotton then one thing or another.  Yes.  Well, apparently, I didn   t that year.  With perfect attendance, probably not. Unless it was an approved  absence, then maybe.  Well, I don   t think I got many of them, because one time they was  having a rabbit drive. The rabbits were so terrible.  Oh, rabbit drive     This was when the whole community would get together, and they   d  come together on a thousand rabbits.  Now, was these jackrabbits?  Yes.  Yes. They   re almost a thing of the past.  I wanted to get out to do that. I was big enough to handle a gun.  Would you use guns or clubs?  Guns. I don   t know. They had this part somewhere to let them out and  then you shot as they went out. My mother wouldn   t   she wouldn   t hear  to it.  32  G. Allison  B. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Now, they devastated the country.  Yes. I don   t remember to what extent, but they was something you  didn   t want on your wheat, because you wouldn   t have much harvest.  Would you have any issues with grasshoppers in the    30s?  Not so much. There was times they would be bad, eat the bark off the  fence post or the bark off the trees. They   d eat some small fence posts in  two, I guess. The hoe handles and shovel handles     When you made your fence, did you use wood from the property?  Now, this down on the old homestead, most all of the posts on it   now,  I don   t know what the first posts put on it was, but my grandfather  planted bodark trees down here on that creek, and they   re still there,  dozens of them. They would cut them at the right time. If you wanted a  corner post, you   d let them get pretty big. If you just wanted a post down  a line, well, a real small one is all right there. Them things is almost  indestructible, now. They last almost forever. They had quite a bit of  areas fenced off with hog wire, woven wire. They raised a lot of hogs  down there. Like on the range or something, they wouldn   t be that big,  but maybe a five or ten acre spot for the hogs to run.  Did you have a smokehouse, then, for ham?  Oh, yeah.  Good stuff, huh?  Sure enough.  Well, we haven   t talked about holidays. We need to get into that just a  little bit. Whose house would you go to, and what would be some of the  favorite foods?  Oh, that jumped around a whole lot. My mother wasn   t real crazy about  some of her in-laws. I   m not saying she wouldn   t associate with them,  but some of them    (Laughs) I can remember my mother   s sister   my  mother moved here from Indiana. I can   t tell you what year. It was up in  the teens. Her sister was born, I think, after they moved down here. But  my mother had to take care of her when she was little, because her  mother had died, and I think her dad married after that, but my mother  didn   t get along with her at all. But anyway, the sister used to come     either we would go to Oklahoma City for Thanksgiving or Christmas,  one of the two, and they would come down here either Thanksgiving or  33  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  Christmas, whichever it was. That was the main holidays. We had get-togethers,  community get-togethers. We   d have at least two to three  weenie roasts every fall and winter. We   d have one or two watermelon  feeds in the summer.  Well, part of what is still tradition in this community is Memorial Day  services up here at the school in recognition of the loved ones that   s  passed away that   s in the cemetery and to also recognize     The servicemen.  How long has that been going on? It   s still   eighty, close to ninety  years? We still have services every year.  I don   t know if there are any of them programs right there. (Gestures)  Okay, and then Easter, Easter Sunday, a picnic on the creek. That has  been going on forever until about two years ago. There has been some  drastic illnesses and deaths within some of the other families, and I  guess a little bit of a lack of reorganization keeping it going.  They still have it at the schoolhouse.  We didn   t have it last year or the year before.  No.  Them two main things are still conducted within the community.  But box suppers and pie suppers galore. They was usually at the  schoolhouse. And if you had a girlfriend, you   d want her pie, but you  didn   t let anybody know it, because they   d run the price way up on you.  Same way with the boxes. It was all fun.  To me, holidays, it was always exciting to go across the road. Something  about Grandma   s house. Now, his sister, her and her husband after they  married and moved to the city, they had two boys, which were from  three to five years older than me. But it was always exciting   we was  real close. It was always exciting to see them because they was town  boys. (Laughter) But it was exciting for them to come down here, too. It  was always fun going to Grandma   s, even though it   s just a walk across  the field to get there. Always good eating.  What would she fix?  Oh, everything. As far as Thanksgiving, all the main courses. The one  34  B. Allison  G. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  main thing I always remembered, and I think my sister   s got the recipe,  is the carrot salad. It   s the slivered carrots in like a JELL-O with pecans.  And, gosh  I could eat the whole bowl. But a traditional Thanksgiving  every time, and then Christmas was pretty close to Thanksgiving as far  as what they would fix.  It   s gotten more so that way in recent years, because there   s not much  difference in Thanksgiving dinner and Christmas dinner. I remember the  first time somebody set a slice of pie in front of me and said,    That   s  sweet potato pie.       Oh, I don   t want that     I can   t tell any difference in  it, really. (Laughs)  Oh, I got in bad trouble. I think it was one Thanksgiving. The way the  house was situated down there, they had a pretty big dining room table,  probably as big as this one, once you let it out, in the main room of the  house. The kids, children would have to eat in the kitchen. It was just a  doorway apart. They would always ask the blessing and so on, and it  was mainly three of us boys, my two cousins and me. We was cutting up  all the time, and someone in the other room got us to quiet down and  they said the prayer. When it was over with, just kind of in a low voice, I  said,    Amen, Brother Ben. Shot a goose and killed a hen.    (Laughter) I  never did think I was the one that said that, but they both agreed that I  was. So, I guess I probably was.  Well, I ain   t never heard that before.  And then what happened to you?  Nothing. (Laughter)    You shouldn   t do that      Who would usually do the discipline if it needed to be done?  My mother, mainly. She got your attention. There was a tamarack, bush,  tree, shrub just outside the door. She kept a tamarack switch. Oh, it  wasn   t nothing as big as a pencil. But she kept it up on top of the  refrigerator that was right there in the kitchen, and she could make you  dance and you didn   t forget it. (Laughter) Finally, after we got older,  we   d blame each other, my sister and I, for different things. She   d hand  the switch to one of us,    Okay, you switch her. When you get through,  she   s going to switch you.    I didn   t like that. (Laughs) My sister, she  didn   t have any mercy on me. But if she didn   t, she   d get it again from  my mother.  When it was time to discipline you, who did it?  My mother. She grew up   she was the youngest of five kids. The oldest  35  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  of her family was a sister and then three boys. So, them three boys, she  grew up with them because the older sister was quite a bit older than the  other three boys. They was quite ornery growing up and they teased her,  I guess, a lot. But she took it well, but Mom was somewhat short-tempered,  didn   t put up with no horseplay. When she hollered, you  listened. If it was severe, then when Dad come in, the belt off of a saddle  was the answer to the story.  Take the buckle off. (Laughs)  I   ll tell you what, boy. We probably still have it. It was always a new  looking   it was a what, girder belt off of a saddle?  I don   t know.  It wasn   t used that much, because it always brought back the  remembrance of the last time it was pulled out.  That was the purpose. (Laughs)  I think the main thing, Mom   and it   s just like kids back then, they  wanted their kids to show respect. Without saying today     That was a big thing. If you wasn   t real polite to your elder, first time  they get you off to yourself, they   d say,    Don   t you understand that  you   re supposed to have respect for them?    We didn   t have to say    Yes  sir,    and    No sir,    and stuff like that, but say    Mr.    and    Mrs.,    and so  on. Not call them by their first name.  I know Grandma, a time or two, got after me and my sister. That always  ashamed me worse because I knew if she got onto us that we was going  to get it here, too. It actually kind of embarrassed me, because she   s a  grandma. It wasn   t very often that we would get on her nerves.  Which grandma are you talking about?  Grandma Allison.  Yes, that   s what I figured.  You didn   t get the switch? (Laughs)  I can   t remember what it was.  It would have been a tamarack switch.  36  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Probably so.  All she ever hit us with, but it was enough.  Actually, on both sides, of his family and my mother   s, I was the  youngest. So, all my cousins, even though his sister is younger than him,  she married before he did and had kids. So, them older kids would come  down and get me in trouble every time, because I didn   t know any  different. But I wouldn   t trade it for nothing. It was a lot of fun.  Well, today on the farm you   re involved with the alfalfa production. Are  you doing anything else? Are you running cattle or?  Had cattle up until about a month ago. Sold the cattle     Run out of hay and     A number of different reasons. We have never had that many cattle.  From twenty to twenty-five, thirty momma cows at the most. The cattle  operation was never, as far as his or my part of the operation of the  farming, was never that big of a thing. The biggest reason I went ahead  and sold was there has been cattle on this homestead since basically  1901. Okay, after going through what we did last summer, the grass was  eaten into the ground. Okay, I had enough hay to keep them   I started  having to feed hay back in August of last year. Okay, that took up what  hay I had left over from the past winter until I got some wheat pasture. I  grazed the wheat pasture.  The price of cattle are real good. Not knowing what to expect next   this  coming spring    I mean, yes, I think early spring will be great, but then  this summer? I don   t know what to expect this summer. And then not  having the hay. I   m in the market of selling hay, not buying it. I just felt  like this would be a time to go ahead and maybe sell out for the time  being, and I can always buy back later. Now, different ones say,    Well,  they   re going to be so expensive to buy back.    Well, you know, that   s  just life.  You don   t want to buy that many anyway.  Yes, I wouldn   t want to buy that many right off the bat. The cattle I had  was a mixed breed, but they was pretty much from the herd that my  grandfather had.  Shorthorns, at least some shorthorns.  It was like a day after I sold them, I felt bad. More for the cattle, though,  37  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  B. Allison  Nykolaiszyn  wondering if I did the right thing. The more I think about it, I feel like I  done what I needed to do.  You made a statement there that the cattle had grazed it into the ground.  Well, I mean, yes, I agree, but it was because it didn   t grow any.  That   s right. I mean, it will come back, but it   s not going to come back  like it normally would. After a period of time, a pasture land does need a  rest where it can come back and get more coverage over the barren  ground. I mean, there   s ground out there that   s kind of barren. So, I  just   I   m trying to preserve the land. The thing is, with some of my  neighbors that are still hanging on, the problem they   re foreseeing right  now, even though they have enough hay, is the pond water. Yes, we   re  getting rain here every now and then. Like they   re talking about rain this  afternoon, tomorrow, and into the next day, but it has always been the  small, two or three-tenths. We need two or three inches at once to fill the  ponds back up. We   re far from out of the woods on this drought deal.  Last year was a devastation for everybody    I just hope this spring   I  feel like this spring and into the summer will be good. I just don   t know  what to expect mid to the end of the summer. The hot dry weather is one  thing, but when it don   t rain, that   s bad.  Doesn   t that impact growing the alfalfa? Or is that different?  Yes. The alfalfa is a very durable plant. Basically, it don   t die. Basically  what it does, it goes into dormancy like it does in the wintertime. When  it goes into dormancy in the summer, then it takes usually about twice as  long. I mean, it   s still green, but it just don   t grow. Then when you get a  rain, you think,    Well, here in thirty days, I   ll have a crop.    No, because  it   s got to come back alive and start growing again. You know, towards  the end of this past summer/fall, because we   ve cut hay up until October  or November. We got rains in October. Good rains. We got enough  where I got a good wheat up and I thought,    Well shoot, we   ll have at  least one more cutting.    It grew, but it was slow coming back out of  dormancy. I finally cut hay in December, and it laid for a month. I baled  it January 9th of this year, unheard of time to be cutting and baling hay.  Alfalfa roots will go twenty foot to water if they have to. Well, if  they   ve down there twenty foot to get a drink, it can start raining a bunch  up here. But of course, most of your feeder roots are on top, close to the  top. It will grow, but until you get some water to that taproot, it   s not  going to do real good.  Did you see that any of your regular customers, maybe, are scaling back  or having trouble producing hay?  38  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  Yes, I   ve got a couple of commercial people that raise horses like for     Cutting horses.     cutting horses. One particular one used to probably run from probably  thirty-five to fifty horses and he   s cut back to about twenty to twenty-five.  Yes, most of them have cut their size back. Keeping what they feel  like are the best of the horses. Then you always got the ones that  probably would go borrow money to continue to buy the hay. That   s the  passion they have. Yes, a lot of people have cut way back. One thing  I   ve noticed since this last summer, and I have noticed it over a few  years anyway of the price increases. I mean, we all have. It seems like  fuel is the beginning and it just escalates from there. It seems like to me  in the last six months stuff has just went up so greatly. I don   t want to  charge for my commodity and charge people where don   t want to buy it.  But the thing is, I   ve got to charge     Too much.     in a way where I can stay in business.  Which is too much for a lot of people.  That   s right, that it   s going to be too much for a lot of people. But I have  a wide variety of people I sell to. I sell to hay brokers out of Texas.  They   re struggling down there as bad or worse than we are. The thing is,  what I   ll have to figure out, I basically base my prices off the Oklahoma  market. And then the price can vary up or down in this area on possibly  how much hay there is. I like to get the most I can, but I do have  compassion for my customers. I want them to come back. So, it   s just  going to   it   s hard sometimes to price the hay because I guess I worry  too much of what the people might think of me if I price it too high. But  I   m just trying to stay afloat like everybody else. So, it   s going to be  interesting this spring to see what happens.  Well, we   ve talked a lot about the last 100 years. What do you see for the  next 100?  I don   t know. In my opinion, in the next probably fifteen to twenty years  right here, possibly home development. We   re so close to Lawton. The  thing is, Lawton has pretty much built around us because nobody in this  community wants to sell, because they want to keep it what it is. But that  won   t last forever. I mean, money does the talking. Some day here soon,  someone in the area will sell land for development. When that happens,  it will just be a domino effect. The other problem is we   re pretty much  considered a smaller farm. When we are talking about people farming  39  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  five, six thousand acres. If I figured up my cultivation along with my  grass, I   m barely a thousand. We take care of that, him and I. Well, I  have no hired help, so my job is a full-time job. I don   t really see that  lasting over another twenty, twenty-five years.  He   s talking about the proximity we are to town.  Being this close to town, it   s like what I had said before, we   ve got a lot  of hobby farmers. They have made their money elsewhere, and they can  compete more than I can at times. I hope I   m wrong, but I   ve got to  think about this stuff and face reality. The equipment has gotten so out  of our range. See, what I   m comparing to what we do here is to people  like in Iowa or Ohio where they got really rich ground up there and they  got abundant rainfall. Okay, corn, milo, crops like that bring big, big  money. Where down here, we   re very limited to what we grow because  of our heat. Wheat usually comes off in the spring. So, wheat grows  good down here. Alfalfa grows good down here. There   s other places in  the state that it grows better because they got better rainfall. It all comes  down to the rainfall. It just seems like it   s getting harder and harder  every year to make things work like they did the year before. It   s  because of the lack of rain. They say it will come back some day. I just  hope I can hang out until that some day. I don   t know when that some  day is going to be.  I   ve been saying the same thing.  It just seems like every year,    I   m going to wait until the next year and  it   s going to be better.    Well, I   m into it again. I   m hoping this year will  be better. You know, I think since I survived last year, I can survive a lot  of things. But the increase of the fuel and the increase of the  machinery   and I   m not complaining about the   the machinery has got  to increase because of everything has increased on their part. I guess my  problem is wheat. We don   t have that much control over wheat.  I didn   t think I could talk as much as I have.  You   ve done good. Is there any, like the next generation, that wants to  farm? And grandkids interested in it?  They don   t even carry the Allison name. See, like my sister   s boys  and     But are they even interested in it?  My sister actually just has one boy. See, the picture   well, no, they   re  not up there. They lost a boy, and then they had one other one.  40  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  I know you   d asked me some questions about the layout. This was in  later years. (Gestures) I want to say after World War II. We had no place  to work on the machinery except just out under a shade tree, maybe. My  dad bought this little building here from a neighbor. It was just an old tar  paper building that they had at Fort Sill during World War II for   took  the place of a tent. It had a concrete floor, and they throwed up some  boards and wrapped it in tarpaper. It had a big ole pot belly stove in the  middle. That was the barracks for them.  This building here, a Pontiac dealer uptown was updating, and he was  getting rid of this building and building a new body shop. (Gestures) It  was actually in the alley behind the dealership. My dad made a deal for  that. Actually, him and me and my two uncles, we was pretty much the  only ones who tore it down and hauled it out here and put it back up. I  know the fellow that owned it there come out there late one afternoon  and said,    Boy, y   all are already getting along good with that.    I had an  uncle who was about half comical. He said,    Oh, we   d have been a lot  further along if we hadn   t been putting it back up as we   d hauled it out  there.    Which we wasn   t, we was just unloading it. (Laughs)  Always recycled and reused things, right?  Yes. Out here is the silo, the trench silo.  They just dumped it in with the dirt around it?  Oh, yes. That   s some more, they was working on an old bulldozer. That  was my job, mainly. It wasn   t my bulldozer, but it was mainly my job to  drive it and keep the silage spread out and packed down. Something  apparently had happened to the dozer and there was the trucks all  waiting in line to dump, because you couldn   t dump too much in there at  once, because you couldn   t pack it. We was all waiting on the dozer to  get back going.  Doing that instead of having a silo?  Well, that is a     Pit silo. They still use them. The big thing up north     They call them bunkers.  They call them bunkers. Actually, that   s a big thing up north is the flat  bunker silos. The big uprights, they   re pretty much a thing of the past  because they require a lot of maintenance to keep them going. I ain   t  41  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  Finchum  G. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  going to say they   re not still used, but your bunker silos are more  modern to today   s operation.  I noticed there wasn   t a windmill?  No.  Was there ever one?  No, we didn   t have any need for one. You couldn   t hardly put it down  on the creek because the trees would interfere with air getting to it.  When you get away from the creek a little ways, there   s no water. Right  here where we   re at, you   d have to go twelve hundred foot straight down  to get water. It would be artesian water and a good chance it wouldn   t  taste good.  When they got the piece of property, they didn   t have a choice of what  piece they got if it was a lottery, just whatever was drawn?  I don   t know that. I actually don   t know that.  I mean it   s not like doing the Land Run where you go and stake a claim.  Well, I think here you maybe could ride out and look. I guess they had a  stake with the     The way I always thought it was, was your grandpa come up here and  signed up. And he come out and picked out his preference. Okay, then  when his name or number was drawed, then he told them if it hadn   t  been chosen yet, what he wanted.  That makes sense.  I   m thinking his sister, my aunt, has got a book on all that. It   s got the  listing of the names and the numbers. I think forty-six, he was the forty-sixth  one drawn, to the best of my knowledge. I wish we had that book  where I could show you. You think it would be in y   all   s library?  We   ll have to look.  See, I never did understand the different times when these land runs or  land was let out. I was shocked to understand that this side of Highway  81, from there on, was Big Pasture. It wasn   t part of Duncan. Right  along the little highway, of course, there wasn   t a highway then, but  right there was the line that this was Oklahoma Territory and this was  Oklahoma.  42  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  G. Allison  B. Allison  Finchum  Do you think the railroad probably divided it?  Yes, because it gets close to the     See, Duncan is so much older than Lawton in time of being in existence.  But mainly what made this part of the country to be known is Fort Sill. It  was here back in the 1800s.  Well, earlier, middle 1800s.  Tell them about Grandpa always seeing and talking to Geronimo.  Well, I don   t know that he talked to him. He   d see him real often.  Geronimo?  Yes. Well, it was Geronimo himself. I can   t tell you whether it was  before they locked him up out here at Fort Sill or after. It was probably  after. He nearly always had a group of ladies with him, his wives. Four,  five, maybe six. I think they would be walking, and he   d be on his horse.  I don   t know what direction they lived or anything. I was thinking about  Geronimo the town right down here, but I don   t think that had anything  to do with it. I guess everybody was a little bit scared of him. I don   t  think he approached him and went to talking to him. I   m sure there was  a few of the, what, city fathers or something that would or did. Anytime  there was like a holiday or anything, he would come to Lawton and be  seen.  He was pretty tamed.  Oh, yes, by then. After they locked him up and drug him around and so  on.  I thought I had a picture of him, but there was a lot of pictures of him.  There   s been a lot of controversy about where he   s buried and        where he should be buried. He   s out here, and I think it   s his  descendants that   s out in New Mexico is wanting him out there. I mean,  why bother a grave that has been in existence forever?  The town   s named after him and all.  Well, alright. I think we   ve covered most of our questions.  43  B. Allison  Finchum  Used up your time, anyway. (Laughs)  We really appreciate you sharing your story with us.  -------  -------
