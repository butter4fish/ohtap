 L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Today is April 23, 2011. My name is Latasha Wilson, and I am with the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma State  University Library. I am at Coyote Corner today, about nine miles south  of Mangum, Oklahoma. I am talking with Margaretha Harriman about  her time growing up in Germany and moving to the United States.  Her  niece Margaretha Schwabe is joining us, as well as Randy Wilson.  This  is part of the  Germans in  Oklahoma oral history series. Thank you for  talking with me today. To start out, will you tell me when and where you  were born?  I was born on the tenth of June, 1924.  And where were you born? What town?  Rasdorf, Germany.  And that is in the state of Hesse?  Right.  In the district of Fulda.   East of Frankfurt?  Yes, southeast.  Were you born in a hospital?  No. My mother was a midwife, and she had doctor friends that must   ve  been there, I don   t know. I was born in my home. Since my mother was  a midwife in this town, I think she had a doctor there. I wouldn   t know.  Did you have brothers and sisters?  5  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  I had two brothers. They both had accidents. They are dead.  Were they older than you?  Older, the first baby. The other one was born in 1913.     13? Wow.  Yes, so  the oldest  must   ve been born about 1911. I have the papers  from it.  What were your parent   s names?  My mother   s name was Filomena and my father   s name was Reinhardt.  What did they do for a living?  My mother was a midwife. My father was, by that time, ready to, I don   t  know what you call it, big business. He was a combination carpenter and  constructor.  Contractor. He was a building contractor.  He made buildings and such things. I think I had a nice life. But, that  didn   t last very long.  What were some of your chores growing up?  I didn   t have chores. I had enough older sisters and my parents really  didn   t want to have the kids hanging around. We all had school or jobs.  So you stayed busy.  No, we had no choice. If there was a good school I wanted to go to, I  was lucky to go to it. We were not spoiled kids.  What did you do for entertainment?  Very little. Studied.  Did your family have a garden?  Oh, yes. I didn   t learn gardening until I was married and my husband  retired in California, and there I had a good garden.  Did your mother garden?  6  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Very little.  What are some foods that your mother would prepare?  Food? I never cared about it.  You just ate it?  Soups, potatoes, meat, and salad, lots of salad. In the summertime, we  had salad every day. And eggs. We butchered three pigs for the family,  and that lasted almost a year. Sometimes we went to the butcher and  bought some meat for a Sunday or a holiday. Other than that, we had  smoked meat, sausages. Ham  Oh yes, I wish I had that ham  Oh, just  one  (Laughter) They have so much meat here and nothing is right.  What about sauerkraut and bread?  Well, that   s an American story. Anybody in the country has their own  sauerkraut.  In the basement, im keller.  Im keller? Oh yes, yes well they don   t have keller. (Laughter) It   s in a  big barrel im keller.  In the basement.  In the basement. There are a lot of things in barrels. Pickles, about like  this, and different meats, but I never know how it was done because it  had to be soaked for a long time and then smoked. I didn   t have chores.  Were your grandparents near you when you were growing up?  Of my grandparents, I only know my mother   s mother. There was  nobody there anymore. I was the youngest in the family.  How old were you when you started to school?  I think six years old.  And what was school like?  I think most of the time, strict.  Was it only girls?  7  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  No. We had boys and girls in the same class when I grew up there.  What were some subjects you enjoyed in school? Did you like math?  No, I didn   t like math, but I made it. It was boring for me. I liked to  paint, I liked to read stories. I was not so great, but I managed.  What would you do after school?  I had friends. Yes, I did a lot of little woodwork things. My father liked  that. I was father   s little girl. (Laughter)  His favorite?  Yes. I had good eyesight, and he wanted me to become a carpenter. My  mother was almost    They  women  started in those years. There were  not many, but I knew one and she made it and made the master. My dad  thought I could do that, too. I thought I could. I am handy with tools and  things, everything hanging around here.  Were politics discussed in your home?  Yes, but not with us kids. The grownups, my father had friends but they  usually worked and would see him in his business. I don   t think we had  any  discussion of  politics, not that I remembered.  What was the name of your school?  Das weiss ich nicht.  I don   t know.  (Laughter)  It had no name. It was just a village school.  So when did things start changing around the time of the war? When did  the atmosphere change?  When did the atmosphere change? You mean politically?  Yes, and everyday life.  I didn   t have any friends that were interested in politics that young. Even  so, we went together in political school. It was just something you had to  learn. For instance, we had to learn when Hitler   s birthday was. I   ve  never forgotten it to this day. (Laughs)  When is it?  8  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Hitler   s? On the twentieth of April. Check it  (Laughter) But that   s about  the only politics we had. I turned out to be what you call the Brownies,  leader, and I had to teach them that was Hitler   s birthday. That is one  thing I remember. (Laughs) I like to visit with the kids. Come to think of  it, yes, we had lots of sports in the afternoon. I went into the forest and  taught them about the birds, the weasels and everything. I enjoyed  children, but other than that I think that was the only thing we learned,  was Hitler   s birthday.  What sports did you play in school?  Running, high jumping. Well, I didn   t get to swimming until later. I was  good in running and high jumping. I was the best. We didn   t have any  equipment. Anything we had to do, we had to do on our own.  Well besides learning Hitler   s birthday in school, do you think there was  anything different that you learned than what kids today learn?  I really don   t know what kids learn. I think they have much more  playing time, so it seems to me. Even I   ve been to American schools  (not very often), but they are looser in their behavior. That is one thing.  They don   t seem to respect their teacher very much.  Perhaps the discipline is not as much?  That is the way I could   ve said it. I have met teachers and the whole  atmosphere when I came in the room, they all were just finger painting  on the wall. Nobody ever learned anything from it. While the teacher is  talking they don   t shut up. They keep on talking.  If you had done this while you were in school, what kind of punishment  would you have?  We didn   t have but a little stick.  And you would get your hand swatted?  No, because by that time it was already in Hitler time. You were not  hurting somebody   s hand, you needed to live with it. That was one thing  that was forbidden. I wasn   t punished very much. My punishment was if  I didn   t shut up. I think I   m still punished for that, if I talk, talk, talk. My  father told my teacher to give me something that I had to write fifty  times, two hundred times,    or whatever you think is fit, but I don   t want  her spanked     He was very strict. I don   t think any of my sisters got  spanked in school.  9  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  But other kids did?  Yes, especially the teacher   s son. He was a poor learner, and my mother  thought he never should   ve gone to next year   s class in the first place,  you know. I   ve seen kids   I don   t know, maybe very few   that didn   t  do their homework and they know the next day when they go to school  that the teacher was going to spank them. So they would put a magazine  or something in their pants. (Laughter) I remember that.  What were other things that were forbidden?  I don   t really remember anything that was forbidden. Give me an idea.  I thought you said something was forbidden. Slapping of the hands?  Yes. I remember this, because we had a new teacher. He was told from  somebody from above. My father told me that at home, that he was  corrected in his habits, and no spanking. My father always said,     Because I work with kids that come from that school, and if they have  talent then you ruin it.    But I had no such problem. I had to do many  pieces of paper of the same word. One time I remember a hundred times.  I was a smart alec. (Laughter) I had to write a whole sentence of  whatever it was, but I had made marks on it a hundred times instead of  writing the word. So, I had to do it a hundred times again  (Laughter) I  still think of it.  What did you have to write?  That I don   t remember. That is many years ago. (Laughter)  So when did the Hitler Youth start in school?  As children, we didn   t have anything to do much with Hitler. We were  too small. You came out of school when you are thirteen or fourteen  years old. I really don   t remember. It didn   t mean anything to me. For  instance, Hitler went past Fulda and H  nfeld, which was our county  seat. Nobody wanted to go and see Hitler. Nobody went.  He wasn   t a big deal.  Well, that was twelve kilometers. Anyhow, somebody had a little pickup   truck  where they could   ve taken us to see Hitler riding by in a train. I  didn   t want to see Hitler. I don   t know anybody that went. Of course,  there were not many cars around either. We didn   t have cars. They came  later. Only rich people had them, and those who had money enough to  10  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  R. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  buy a car had other things to do with their money.  Do you remember when the war began?  It started with the Rhineland in    39.  How did you know that it had begun?  People were drafted. People were standing around with their husbands  and crying because they had to go to war.  Did you know for a long time that that was coming?  I knew that the war was coming, yes, in    39, because we had to get out  of East Prussia. That   s where the school was.  Your school?  Yes. See, in    38 we went there to this school. In    39 the war came. So  from Poland. That is the only war we were thinking about. We didn   t  have televisions that you could see Hitler marching in the Rhineland.  They talked about it, the grownups. After all, the Rhineland was lost in  the First World War, and Hitler was taking it back. To me, that was just  quite all right. People were standing there saying,    Oh  They took the  Rhineland back  They took the Rhineland back     People were so poor in  Germany, in school a pencil had to be that long (very short) before you  could throw it away. Today, they give boxes full like that  (very long) .  What was the Rhineland?  The Rhineland? It   s between Germany and France.  That was between Germany and France, and it has changed hands over  centuries between those two countries. After the First World War, it was  taken over and belonged back to France.  That is when I think people thought Hitler was great. He had no war, he  just had to march into the Rhineland and everybody was waiving.  So it was easy?  Yes, it was easy, and people like my father, they talked about that. Like  he said,    England probably said that is all right. Wait until he makes the  next step.    That is how they were talking about it, but I was really not  interested. I was too young. I didn   t want to think about war, and it came  anyhow.  11  L. Wilson  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  What was the school you were at in Prussia?  Just describe what you did at that school.   Leadership was the focus.  And then certain talents were tested. If you  had enough, you could go to the next school, which was all leadership. I  went to that, too.  How old were you when you went to this school?  I was thirteen when I went there, and I turned fourteen when I was in  school. The next year I went to another school, but that was in Germany.  Did you live at the school? Was it far from your home?  We would have to make a train ride. Nobody had money for a train ride.  You lived at the school.  Yes, we lived in the school. And only girls.  Did you wear uniforms?  Only when we had to go    For instance, we had a ten kilometer walk to  church. Once a week we would go to church, and there were Catholics  and Protestants. They had to take the Catholics there and the Protestants  there, and then we made that walk home. It was a nice walk. It was in  East Prussia, beautiful country. There were forty girls. One was  supposed to be sent home, but then they changed their minds and had a  doctor come and see everybody. If you got sick and you could not just  have a cup of tea or take a pill, then you could go back home. For  instance, when we went swimming   we learned swimming   there were  quite a few of them that had something with their heart that made them  not have to go swimming.  But it was a good school?  I think it was a very good school. I learned many things there. The food  was okay. Like in Germany, there wasn   t much food there. We even had  vitamins, some of us, which helped to make our brains strong. It helped  you if you had a lot to study.  So you were at this school in 1939?  Yes.  12  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  L. Wilson  Harriman  Did things change once Rhineland was taken?  It was another school.  What is the next school you went to?  The same thing, only part leadership and capabilities. We had to learn so  many things.  Do you feel like you became a better leader because of these schools?  Oh, absolutely, because you had to teach the others. If you had talents  that you can give, you go up. I have no complaints about the school. We  all came from the same area, and we all wanted to be great. I never  wanted to be a film star, for instance. There are many things that I can  do with my hands that nobody else can do unless they learn it. I was no  good in the kitchen or in the laundry room. (Laughter) But I had to go a  while there anyhow.  Did you still want to be a carpenter at this point, or work with wood?  No, no.  What did you want to do?  I wanted to be a teacher. And I graduated. There are so many things that  young people don   t get to learn unless somebody helps them. Many  parents don   t have the time or the patience to work with them. I felt  quite valuable. Like I said, there are many things that we had to do. I  even have some pictures of them. If you wanted to produce    I   ll give  you an idea. We had to learn how to skin a sheep.  You learned to shear, not skin.  To shear is to take the wool.  Yes. Anyhow, I was in that class, too. I thought it was funny. It wasn   t  funny. I was corrected many times.    Don   t you dare show off?    Then  you have to know how you clean it, how you comb them, and how you  spin it. I have pictures of all of  those steps  because it got interesting  then. At first, that thing was laying there with its feet up, like that. Holy  cow  (Laughter) It   s funny, those things don   t go away. I have these  ideas all the time. I like to think about it. I liked the school. In that  school I did not have the right things. I was not mouthy, because those  teachers knew a lot more than I did. That was when I was fourteen years  13  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  old.  My parents even got a nice letter from  the school . I made some kind of  an autumn album there too that my father got, but the war came. There  was no talking about Hitler. We made trips to the border from Russia, all  the way past Poland into Germany again. I don   t know how long we  were all there.  So what happened once the war started?  When the war started? I don   t know, it was just commotion. We didn   t  have a brother to go to war. My brother had died. There were only  women there. I don   t know when the time came that women got to  volunteer. Like my neighbor, she volunteered. It was kind of like in  America when my husband said, he had a good school, but he wanted to  make money. Everybody was working now for the defense so he was  stuck with the cows at home. He said he never wanted to see another  cow in his life. (Laughter)  So when your neighbor volunteered, was she in     Yes, that was   I was not home.  But did she become a soldier?  Yes. I don   t know what she did. She had a uniform, a nice uniform. I  only had a man   s uniform because I wasn   t a volunteer.  So volunteer was better than being drafted. They had a higher status?  Of course. There were taught, too. We were just thrown into place. I was  in a Flak station.  What did your father do in the war? Was he involved?  No.  He stayed home and worked?  Honey, I was born in    24, so I was the youngest. How old do you think  he was?  Was there an age limit?  I wouldn   t know that. I think after the war came to take older people     what we call Home Defense   you know they had the Flak station on the  14  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  R. Wilson  Schwabe  R. Wilson  Schwabe  hill. There, they shot an American plane down about half a mile from  our home. Nobody came to help. Next to it was a little village of about  150 people. They went to the city and reported that there were two  soldiers buried in their town, but nobody ever came. The women always  fixed up their graves just like the Germans built. In springtime they  would plant flowers there. In the fall they  inaudible . This was a time  that I wasn   t around, but I was around when the plane came down.  In a village, would many of the men go to war, so the women took their  jobs, or helped out?  I don   t think that the women got their jobs, because it usually was not  women   s work. We didn   t have a factory. The only thing that could be a  factory was my father   s place, and this never had more than around  thirty people. I don   t know. The women had their pension, I guess, to  have their pay. I really don   t know. (Laughs) Well, I wasn   t married.  Since your mother was a midwife, did she serve as a nurse during the  war?  Yes, she was studying at a University in Marburg.  Did she help wounded soldiers and those types of things?  She had nothing to do with the war. The people at home needed nurses,  too. She was too old anyhow.  What is a Flak station?  An anti-aircraft gunner.  Oh, yes. The Flak station. In Osnabr  ck and Kassel. I started in Kassel  and then went off to     There were two industrial cities in the north of Germany. Kassel and  Osnabr  ck.  So she went to the north of Germany?  Yes.  That   s quite a distance from home.  Well, nothing in Germany is far, but if you have to walk back, it   s  several hundred miles.  15  Harriman  Schwabe  R. Wilson  Harriman  R. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  When I came to Osnabr  ck, I had to walk on a gadget like this to read up  the distance.  To set your sites.  On a big gun.  They were supposed to have another one doing it, and they didn   t have  anybody. You had to have good eyesight. My mother was always afraid  that I would have to wear glasses, because I was dog gone Flak. There  was no life in that Flak station. We had no time where you can say you  wanted to write or read a book or something, because the shooting was  going on all the time. You even had to have your bowl of soup and  canteen there while you were working.  Was it all girls, or   ?  No, men. All men and young girls, that   s all. I don   t know any rank or  anything. I didn   t have a uniform until we left. The R  ckzug.  The withdrawal? The retreat?  When you left?  When we left on foot.  That was the retreat, the R  ckzug.  Yes. The English were already... We worked, and down where the city  started, the gardens, the English were already in there and started  shooting. We got a hand grenade. We had no weapons, no pistol, no gun,  just a hand grenade. Because we had to run, run, run, run, run. When  you hear another language that you don   t understand, you   re close to  them. (Laughs) I got a job one time, just overnight, to work the  telephone. I didn   t know what to do on the telephone   It was a switchboard.  Oh yes, the switchboard. They just told me to,    Look, when the light  comes on here, look where the other one is, and get them together.    Get  them together ? You know what I got? (Yells gibberish) The English   (Laughter) I was not a hero, you know.  Had you studied English in school at all?  No, after.  16  R. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  R. Wilson  Schwabe  Harriman  R. Wilson  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Was the switchboard for the Germans or for the English?  It was our switchboard.  It was for the German Army.  But there was English?  Well, the English were already in town, so they probably picked up their  radio signals with the German switchboard.  That was in like Volkswagen.  What town was that?  Osnabr  ck. If you picture Germany, it is in the northwest.  It   s up close to Belgium. So I had to walk from here all the way to  Braunschweig, with the hounds behind us.  The English. By    the hounds,    she means the English.  How far is that?  Honey, I would have to look on the     But a long way?  Yes, yes. That is almost to Berlin.  It was over a hundred miles.  That is  why my friend gave me the address to his aunt and they took care of me.  And you walked?  By that time, I was already lost. I was already sick. You can understand,  as a woman. When women had to go to war, we didn   t have the    We  had nothing, not even a washrag. When somebody had their laundry on  the line, I always stole a towel. I was soiled from here (gestures) to here  (gestures), and still had to run. One time we stayed in a barn and the  artillery took the roof off from it.  Were you alone?  No, the whole platoon. I don   t even know what you call it. I was only  drafted to it.  17  R. Wilson  Harriman  R. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  R. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  Twenty people?  No. I mean, it was not a division, it was not a company, it was  something.  A group?  Yes, a group  You said it. (Laughter)  So when you stayed with these people, when they took care of you, were  you alone then?  Nobody takes care of you. You just better not go, because you are a  deserter. That we knew.  Were you ever captured?  Yes, I was, after the war. Right behind G  ttingen.  This is where Osnabr  ck is. (Showing on map) This is Frankfurt,  Osnabr  ck. This is where we   re from. (Shows Rasdorf) We   re right here  in the mountains, right there. (Gestures) So she walked all the way.  Yes. Before that I went to Punzeleid. See, we had to run. If we had run  anymore, the Russians would have taken us. There at least, G  nther said  to me,    Die Armies (Americans) und die Englanders sind Menschen.  Die Russians sind keine.    That is the way I was taught.  She said,    The Americans and the English are humans. The Russians are  not.    So they referred to     So, that is why he wanted me to go to his aunt. That was a young man.  Anyhow, I was willing for the Americans to take me, but I didn   t want  the English to take me. They were not very nice either. They put me in a  guest house. Right behind it was a big hole.  The English?  Yes, behind G  ttingen. Close to G  ttingen, in a guesthouse in the forest.  A guesthouse, a restaurant type place.  Yes, and there were lots of people, men, and mostly young. The men  were all young, all that were in the war. I don   t know if he was tired or  just lazy. He pushed me into the room, and I didn   t see him anymore.  After a while, how long I don   t know. By now it was dark. I looked out  18  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  L. Wilson  Schwabe  Harriman  the window. I saw the water and I wondered how deep it was. Then I  saw my bicycle with a rucksack   A backpack?  Yes. There was nothing there, I had just eaten what I had. (Laughs) I  knew it was my bicycle, so I just opened the window and went.  (Gestures) It was steep enough that I didn   t touch. I was lucky, I feel  lucky. I looked and he was down there like that. (Demonstrates and  makes snoring noise)  Who was?  The guard   The guard was sleeping? (Laughter)  Yes  He was sleeping loud. (Laughter) I just got my bike and took off. I  was in the woods, and what direction I didn   t know. I just went out.  And you had already had that bike, or you just got it?  Yes. And for that they wanted to make me a prisoner. When I came  home, my Burgermeister, my mayor    But my father went there and he  said,    You don   t touch her     I would   ve gotten some money from the  government. I don   t think my father cared about it. I got home and I was  still sick, very sick. Her  Margaretha Schwabe   s  mother took care of  me.  They pretty much abandoned their station, like most of them did.  So they were deserters, technically, and they could   ve gotten in trouble?  Technically, yes. In the chaos of the last month of the war there were no  records. Nobody kept records and everybody was pretty much on their  own. My mother was the same way. She just made her way back. She  had no official discharge papers, and I think most of them were that way  that survived. There was no more infrastructure. It was just chaos. There  was no government to speak of.  I came out of the forest, and the man at the gas station told me,    If you  go straight to the woods, you come to a little village.    What the name  was, I don   t know. He said,    There are no soldiers there.    He meant the  English. Before that, I had only them to be afraid of, you know. I came  out, and that is when I got caught by the English and put in the guest  house. When I got to the next post, I still had my bike, and there were  19  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  soldiers too. Black  And white ones, but I saw only the black one. He  wasn   t really that ugly. In fact, he was nice. They told me to,    Sit down   Sit     Like a dog   They went and got the Helm, their helmet, filled it with water, and a  piece of soap. Oh, my god. I wasn   t thinking about cleaning myself, I  was just afraid of what they might do to me. If you are that dirty, you  know. They put a blanket up and told me that I would be alone, and to  clean myself up and feel better. My god, they never peeked, even. They  never even peeked in there  I felt pretty relaxed all of a sudden.  Then they gave me C-rations, every person, and a piece of paper. When  I got to the next patrol (they called it the Patrol) I was to give them that  piece of paper. I tried with little English, but I didn   t make it out. So I  just said,    What is in the paper?    He said,    You just show it to them.     Okay. When I got there, I knew what it was. They told the next patrol  that I did not steal it, they had given it to me.  The bike?  No, no, no. The food. So I sat in a schlafgarten  a sleeping area  in a  ditch by the road and started to eat there. Everything they gave me they  took a bite of first, themselves. I always remember that. Well, I was  afraid. I was afraid that they would poison me. I ate my C-rations and it  was the finest food I had ever had. They gave me a whole bunch, like  this. (Gestures) Like a shoebox full. So, I went on my way to home, and  that was long. Very long. They helped me clean up, they gave me food. I  had the best meeting of the war. I didn   t even think  bad  about America  anymore. Funny.  You mentioned earlier that you had this bike that you rode some, and the  tires were flat.  Yes. Sometimes an old man at home would help me. Twice a man  helped me. One time I got to a little village and there was a small house  with a widow in it. Her husband had just been killed. She said,    I can fix  that bike, but I don   t have any oil. It is squeaking.    I said,    I know.    So  we got margarine and smeared my bike.  Did it work?  Well it was better than nothing. (Laughter) It didn   t last very long, but  she fixed the bike. Most of the time I pushed that thing. I had one penny.  My sister found it in my pocket, that I had. I never had a pay day as long  as I was in the military. I didn   t have identification either. That was left  in Kassel. It was bombed every day.  20  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  So how long were you technically in the military?  I think it was in November when I left, I am not sure.  November    44?  Yes. All I had to do was spot the planes. Most of the time I was just  running, but I made it home.  And when you were home you were sick for a while.  A long time. My sister told it, I don   t know. Many things I completely  forgot. Lots of things just came later.  Was it a long time after the end of the war that things started getting  better?  Yes.    46,    47, I really don   t know.  When I was born in    49, remember? How were things then?  Bad, very bad. My father sent me to the American     Her dad   my grandfather   sent her to the military commandant to tell  them that even though we owned two houses, they were occupied by the  Americans, and the family had to live and sleep in the barn.  They were old people. Anyhow, the next day they moved out of one  house and most of them were put into the other one.  So your family could move back into your home?  In the beginning, only the first floor.  What year was this?  Was it 1950?  Yes, that is when I went to Bad Homburg, right.  Nearly five years later.  Like I said, in the beginning, and throughout all of the war, the  American soldiers were better. That made my husband feel good.  (Laughs) I had no problem all the way home after G  ttingen, where  21  L. Wilson  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  there were all Americans. That is where all the English were, up there   before G  ttingen . I had food and I had things to drink, mostly water.  But there was other stuff, too. Whatever it was, I ate everything and I  drank everything. Since I had that piece of paper, the next people gave  me some more food. I always would have to show the piece of paper,  but the Americans didn   t take me prisoner. They fed me.  We had several girls at home that came home similar like this, but they  were prisoners. One of them was an American prisoner, but I don   t  know where she was. They were not drafted like me. They wanted to be  soldiers. I have no papers for anything, but they are somewhere. My  niece went to some office in Germany where they have me as a draftee.  My sister came from Russia, but she belonged to a unit. You still have  your papers and your food, but then on the way home, she was still  lucky. She got to ride the train almost to my hometown. She had  problems with her papers, too. When I came home there was nobody  that gave me a ticket for a train but she was a nurse. They are special  people. Yes, they are officers in the German Army. When she finished  her training, she was in the category of a lieutenant.  How old was she?  About twenty?  Two years older. I always went to the bus station when she had to leave  and said goodbye. We were very special together, even though we were  always fighting. (Laughs) We were still loving. I miss her very much.  What was your first job after the military?  Working for Americans.  What did you do?  House-sit children. They always wanted me with their kids. Then I went  to Frankfurt and went to the American Headquarters in Frankfurt. Then I  worked for the commander from the high commission. They were nice  people. Again, always nice people. I loved that. I   ve got loads of  pictures from them. They wanted me to come to America. I took them  home to show them I also have a home. There might be shots in it, and it  needs work, but it   s there. It   s actually a big place. I had to  inaudible ,  because they always felt very sorry for me. They are nice people. They  have two children, and they were mine.  You fell in love with an American man?  22  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  No, they didn   t want an army girl. When she interviewed me, she said,     You have an American boyfriend?    I said,    No.    She said,    Well, I just  wanted to know if you run around with Americans.    I said,    No, but I  had one. He went to America.     How did you meet your husband?  At home, about two houses from me. In 1947.  Was he living in your village, or in Frankfurt?  He was living in Fulda. His duty was on the border, and we lived on the  border. We went to a dance. There was no dance during the war in  Germany. I met him because I broke my heel  on my shoe  and he sent  them to a shoemaker that he met. That was at night at 12:00, something  like that. They are usually closed at 12:00.  But they got fixed?  They got fixed, but he didn   t have money to pay for it. He never had  money   What was his name?  Dwayne.  When did you get married?  In    53.  In Germany?  I had to wait for the paper to come from America to give the approval.  See, I was a Nazi. My husband married a real live Nazi. If you were to  come again I would have the pictures to show to you, but they are over  there.  So there was more paperwork because you were a Nazi, in order for you  to come to the United States?  That   s why you couldn   t get married. Most of the girls had to go to a  doctor. You could not take any disease to America  But the Americans  can ruin the whole country with their six boyfriends. But anyhow, that is  how I used to talk. (Laughter) Honesty always wins again. He had to go  back to America. Then he came to America, and then he didn   t have  sense enough to buy a stamp for a letter (his excuse). He told me that his  23  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  friends are sitting on the sidewalk begging. That was true, too. They had  no home. The  inaudible  were not needed anymore. That is one thing I  didn   t understand, and disapproved of, because even when you are  housed and you are not there anymore, there should be somebody that  helps them over the rough time. I paid for my own wedding ring. We  had no cake, no wurst  sausage , no turkey. We just had each other and a  paper that said we were married. That is all we had. No pretty dress. I  haven   t missed it, really.  My parents didn   t want me to marry an American. Not because he was  an American, nothing about politics, but because you don   t have the  money to make trips to America. Those trips are very expensive. My  mother said when I left,    You burn me alive.    I told her before she died,     You   re still living, and I am here      Were you able to go back and visit your family?  Yes.  Very often?  Yes. Well, we had to pay maybe a year to pay for the bill. (Laughter)  And I was too proud to tell my father that I didn   t have any money. I  think he figured that himself.  Did they come visit you?  No. They wouldn   t make a trip there anyhow, and they were not   inaudible . People have it in their blood if they want to go someplace.  They were homebodies. My father wasn   t home very much because he  was building. There were lots of military barracks that he built. He had  such contracts. They wouldn   t spend money on a train or a plane. It was  the best thing that I know they had some money. My mother said when I  was a young girl and I would tell her that when I went home with other  young girls, and their parents had cookies, which we don   t have during  the week anyhow,  we had  cake on Sunday. I said,    She said you   re so  rich      My mother said,     You don   t speak about money. You have it.  That   s it.    She was very strict. Well I never had that much money that I  had to speak about it. (Laughter)  So where did you move to in America? What state?  Kentucky.  How long did you live in Kentucky?  24  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Not quite three years. I got my citizenship there.  How long did that take? Was that a long process?  No, but I had to learn something about the country, about the politics,  and about the president. Today they don   t even have to know what the  name is. That is the same thing with the school.  Was there an English language test? Did you have to speak English for  your citizenship?  Well, I spoke, but I came to America to speak English. We had to know  everybody who belongs to Congress. I knew everything then, and I was  ready to shoot to the church. When he said,    Okay, your first question is,  where was your husband born?    I said,    My husband? In Bellingham,  Washington.    They said,    I am sorry. You didn   t pass.    I said,    What?     At that point I forgot everything. My husband was not born in  Bellingham. He was born in a little village right behind that. It is just  like I tell people I am from Fulda. You tell an American, what   s that?  They don   t know where Fulda is, or Hessen, or H  nfeld, or Rasdorf. So I  lost my test right there and he said,    Congratulations. I know you want  to shoot me but I got you first.    Because he was ready for me to shout  everything that I   d learned in the book.  So then what happens?  We got hoarded on a big boat and shipped to Germany. That   s why I got  to make my citizenship early, because I would have to start all over  again coming from Germany. If my husband stays over there, that would  make me   I don   t know how to say it.  Her husband remained in the military, and at that time they shipped the  whole battalion back and forth. Not as individuals, but as battalions. So  her citizenship was expedited because the battalion was transferred back  to Europe.  So you are not rich, but you have luck in life. I studied, and studied, and  studied, and I knew everything except the church where my husband  was born. (Laughter) I can   t believe this  I mean, I really studied hard.  And he says,    No, you   re wrong.     Where did you move after Kentucky?  Germany.  And how long were you there?  25  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  Well, it   s always three years. He went to Korea and I stayed in  Germany. He had three tours in the Far East. The last one killed him.  Were you near your family in Germany?  Yes, I didn   t have to pay for it. I could save the money. When he came  home I could say,    I can buy you a new car     I don   t have to pay for  anything in Germany. Even one time we didn   t get quarters right away,  so we just moved into one of the houses at home. We have big houses,  and we saved the money. Papa pays everything   the electricity, the  coals for the room, everything. The food was served to us by the mama.  When he went back again, it was different. Well anyhow, this has  nothing to do with that.  You eventually lived in California?  Yes.  For quite a while?  I loved it, absolutely loved it. We were very happy.  How many years did you live in California?  Since 1970. That is when my husband came home from Vietnam. He  was discharged, and we moved to California. In    71 I already worked at  Dalton   s.  So you lived there thirty years.  No, in    75 we moved to Chico. That is still California.  Did you have a job?  In    71.  What was your job?  Working in a greenhouse. I loved it. I never knew why people would  come home from work and they were all so tired  I loved the work I had.  I was ready to go back to San Francisco and go back to school. They  liked me, and when you are liked, you get twice as good as you are.  When we went visiting in the valley, my husband liked it. It was a  chance for him to go to work. There was nothing in California except  greenhouses and fisheries where we lived, you know. We bought an  26  L. Wilson  Schwabe  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  expensive house and we both had to work to pay it. He said all of a  sudden, we were sitting at dinner at the house, and he said,    Let   s go  look for a house.    Now, I had no idea about it. I said,    We haven   t even  paid half of it, and you want to sell it? You must be crazy     He said,     Look how nice and warm it is.     We sold the house and moved to Chico, and he got a job. He had already  started at home. He got the paperwork from H R Block for managing  H R Block offices. He was a good student. I was very lucky there,  because he never complained. He had lots of work to study, all those  papers. When he finally had them all and got to send them away, he had  to wait for the answer. How could you? It would have driven me crazy. I  was glad to go to work and have him work on his paperwork at home  alone. He didn   t want me to go to work. It was embarrassing for him,  that his wife had to go to work. The first day he even locked me out and  I was standing in the rain.  When did you move to Oklahoma?  You moved here in 2001.  That is what I was going to say, yes.  How do you like it?  Well, I wanted to be with her. She   s always been my baby. I don   t have  any children.  So you   re here living with your niece.  Right.  South of Mangum. So do you still consider yourself German, or German-  American?  Well, I will never forget that I was born in Germany. I would have to  make a lie.  Do you consider yourself an American also?  I am an American. I would have to say that first, because I have tried  very hard to be an American. I took    I had to  learn the Pledge of  Allegiance . I can say it. Can you? You shouldn   t have to have to sing it.  Do you want to tell us?  27  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  I think I can say it. I just have to find the first word.  Do you have any more stories you would like to share?  I don   t think so. I   m very emotional. It was the worst thing that I had to  live through. It   s not just that you are afraid you will get shot, like I said,  the roof went off. You think you can die any time in the war. To repeat  it, I know how many men felt when they came home and their wives  were anxious, saying,    You don   t love me anymore,    and all this,  because in war, your day may be the last, all the time. When that goes on  and on and on for weeks, you are still awake the next day. It eats on you.  Do you have advice or suggestions on how to deal with this?  No. I think the good schooling from home gives you all the advice you  need. But people don   t want to raise children. They want to put them  somewhere so they can go on a break. Lots of things that you think  about when you are missing everything, you only think about home. It is  hard on me. I had a tough life, and every time I thought I was going, I  didn   t go. Even as a prisoner, I found a way to get out  I hated the  English because they were our enemies. So were the Americans, but  they treated me nice. That made a lot of difference. I even looked at  colored guys. They were not black, they were just different. They were  nice. I was so lucky that I had somebody who gave me something to  drink and to eat, even a bowl of wash water. That was funny. (Laughs)  In that helmet and soap, a little piece like this (Gestures) and a mirror.  A mirror?  A mirror, yes, but he didn   t give me that. He probably figured she is  going to be just as dirty again. But he did let me look in the mirror, and  oh my God  (Laughter)  You may not want to look in the mirror. (Laughter)  Oh no, no. Terrible   So that kindness has gone a long ways.  Oh, yes. I think it   s still there. When I came to America, in Kentucky,  most people were very, very nice, but I had a Japanese neighbor, from  Japan. We were good friends, so we went to little mom and pop stores  because we knew they had everything cheap in there. I wanted to learn  to sew. I picked out some material. You got five yards for a dollar. Can  you imagine? Anyhow, her name was Judy. The woman looked at her  and she said,    I don   t sell anything to Nazis     She looked at me and said,  28  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman  L. Wilson  Harriman     I don   t sell anything to Nazis     I was the Nazi, and she was so nice to  me, but she never went to school. (Laughs) It was ugly the way she  threw her out, but that is politics, and lots of people don   t know how to  make it sound better. I talked to her then, and she said it   s all right. She  said some other things, but that has nothing to do with it. To me, it was  just unbelievable. I had all that material there, and she said,    I   m not  going to sell anything to Nazis      But you didn   t have too many bad experiences?  No, no. I made many friends that invited me to their home to look in  their garden. That is most of the things, because I wanted to raise  a  garden . I was a country girl, but not by American standards. I had two  tomato plants in Kentucky. I put them in the back of the house, because  we weren   t allowed to garden because people just make a mess. Later I  got them. So I had tomato plants like this. (Gestures that they were tall)  But I didn   t know how to get tomatoes on it. It had no food, no flower,  because the vegetable man who sold them to me had taught me that I  should have to pinch all the suckers out. The sucker is between the  branch and leaf, because they are always coming out. I saw so many  little suckers there, what I did I pulled all of the fruit off. The country  girl was gone. I was too stubborn for the country.  Well, I really appreciate you visiting with me today and sharing some of  your memories.  Oh, it was a nice visit. I just got very excited, and I   m afraid to speak  because I have a problem there, and I think it is too much for me  because I am kind of shaky.  I really appreciate it.  But like I said, Americans were very nice to me.  -------  -------
