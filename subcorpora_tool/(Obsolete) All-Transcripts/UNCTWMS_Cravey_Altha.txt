Sarah Catherine Bryan: All right, I am Sarah Catherine Bryan, at Altha Cravey&#8217;s house with Altha Cravey, on June 1, 2013. It&#8217;s around 12:15 in the afternoon. We&#8217;re going to talk for the most part about the development of feminisms and the connections between her academic and activist work. So, would you tell me a little bit about yourself, where you come from?
Altha Cravey: I&#8217;m a Midwesterner but I&#8217;ve been now in North Carolina for about twenty years. I grew up in a small town in Illinois and then I went to high school in Indianapolis, but I feel like I was very shaped by the Midwest although my dad was from the South and we traveled to visit relatives in the South a lot, so.
SCB: Would you say you were raised in a feminist household?
AC: It wasn&#8217;t explicitly feminist but I think that&#8217;s just because we didn&#8217;t have the language for that, so I guess it was a feminist household, for sure. My parents told me that I could do anything and that it was just my imagination that limited what I could do, and that I should think big. They were very encouraging parents and I think they were very feminist but, like I said, we didn&#8217;t have the language for that.
SCB: Would you say that you had a moment or an experience that first exposed you to feminism?
AC: Wow. I think a moment where I realized I was not alone was the first issue of Ms. Magazine. It sounds crazy, but anyway it was wonderful to have a popular magazine come out that addressed many of the ideas I had, so I&#8217;d say that was a crucial moment in terms of beginning to have the language to put a lot of things together that were feminist.
SCB: Did a friend expose you to the magazine or did you find it?
AC: I can&#8217;t actually remember how I found it, but I still have the first issue. Maybe I read about it or heard that it was going to come out so I subscribed to it and then I kept subscribing to it, and I held onto the first issue. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know. It seemed like a dream at first because I guess it reassured me that I wasn&#8217;t crazy in one way, that there were lots of people with some similar ideas.
SCB: And what in particular, which ideas or what topics did you feel were validated in that Ms. Magazine?
AC: Hmm. I should look back at earlier issues to really answer that question well, but it seems like there were so many debates happening at that time about women&#8217;s right to their own bodies. It seemed so obvious to me, but to have it in print and have people discussing that in print, the question of equal pay for equal work became really important to me, so debates around the taking up of civil rights law and broadening [the debates] to include women and the breaking down of, say, the job&#8211;. [Pause] What do you call those? [Laughs] Job adverts, where that became illegal. Just those kinds of debates around equal pay for equal work, that women had a right to do different kinds of work and had the right to have full lives and had a right to be full human beings. It just took lots&#8211;. All of that seemed very exciting to me. No matter what came out it seemed very exciting that these things were changing and people were active in changing them and pushing to change them, so I was excited about the activism and excited about [Pause] being in touch with people all over the place around this issue of feminism. So having that word, I guess, and having that notion that there were a lot of people excited about it and pushing on feminist fronts.   Back to your question, it wasn&#8217;t really about one thing. It was more about all these things and all these possibilities that seemed to be opening up.I&#8217;d always felt that way and, like I told you, I felt like I grew up in a household like that, but the magazine and that discourse, the word, [Laughs] having a notion that there is feminism and feminisms, as you said, was very exciting.
SCB: And did you feel like this validation of you as a whole person and other women as whole people empowered you to combat sexism in your everyday life?
AC: It definitely did. It definitely did. Around that time, I don&#8217;t think because of the magazine or anything, but around that time I went to high school one day&#8211;. We had a dress code in high school, and around that same time&#8211;. I graduated in January, 1970, I got out a little bit early, so it was maybe 1969. The winter was really, really cold and we were supposed to wear dresses and they were supposed to be a certain length and stuff like that, and it was just so cold I decided, I&#8217;m not wearing a dress to school. So things like that, not that it was a direct result of the magazine, but it was clear to me that it was silly to wear a dress to school when it&#8217;s a hundred and&#8211;. What is it? I guess the wind chill factor was way below zero. Anyway, it was silly to wear a dress to school, [Laughs] and then they kicked me out and so I just didn&#8217;t care. I felt like, &#8220;This is silly. I&#8217;ll make them look silly.&#8221; [Laughs] I don&#8217;t care.
SCB: Good. Wow.
AC: But, other things, I guess, that being validated, yes, gave me the strength to just be who I was and let the chips fall where they may around various issues. I know I had a lot of arguments with my parents at that time because I was becoming very independent and I wanted to leave home, and they had made me into the person I was but suddenly they didn&#8217;t seem to like the person that I was. So, anyway, it was partly all the cultural change that was happening and the anti-war protests and things like that, so there were a lot of things going on at once.
SCB: In the area where you were did you feel like there was a strong anti-war push or lots of civil rights activism happening?
AC: In my high school there were people interested in anti-war issues but not&#8211;. And then I found other people through political campaigns. I worked on the McCarthy for President campaign in 1968, so I found a lot of networks through it and through some VISTA volunteers that we met, and we started a reading group at our high school. So yeah, I found a lot of anti-war people, and there were events happening. It wasn&#8217;t huge but it was starting to be huge, and then when I left home a couple years later it was huge in Bloomington. On a college campus it was all kinds of anti-war activities and all kinds of feminist activities, so it was much more prevalent once I left high school, because the high school was conservative. It was on the well-to-do side of town.
SCB: Could you tell me more about your involvement in the McCarthy for President campaign?
AC: Yeah. That was really fun. My friend, Mary Evans, and I started going downtown, mostly because we the fact that he came out against the Vietnam War very early and very strongly, very clearly. So we started going downtown regularly and being part of the campaign staff, showing up every day and doing whatever was needed to be done. We started registering people to vote in Lockefield Gardens, which is predominantly African American. It was very exciting to go in there and register people to vote. It&#8217;s been torn down now.   So we did ordinary office things, got people to sign petitions, stuffed envelopes, but the most exciting was probably going out and signing up people to vote and doing that kind of canvassing, talking about the war, talking about whatever issues people wanted to talk about, and getting politically active and meeting other people who were politically active through showing up every day. Mary ended up going to the 1968 convention in Chicago. I wanted to go but I didn&#8217;t make it. [Laughs] My parents stood in the way of that, so I didn&#8217;t get up there. But it was formative for me to get involved in that direct way in a presidential campaign and see where it went.   We also both went to see Bobby Kennedy. My memory is so poor, sorry, [Laughs] but at the same time Bobby Kennedy came out against the war and he came to Indianapolis to speak on the night that Martin Luther King was killed, so we were there when he spoke and announced to the crowd. Most of the crowd didn&#8217;t know that Martin Luther King had been killed. It became a historic moment, of course, but also then Bobby Kennedy was killed a few weeks after that. So it was a tumultuous time in the US, not just the anti-war movement but all these assassinations, all these mobilizations in college campuses. I wasn&#8217;t in college yet but I knew that people were getting shot at Kent State and I knew that youth were active all over the place, even if they weren&#8217;t that active in my high school. So getting involved in a campaign and just getting to know other political people through that was great.
SCB: How important was the development of interpersonal relationships to keeping you involved? Did that incentivize your work at all?
AC: Yeah, it really did, because it made my life more meaningful to meet people who were doing things. High school seemed incredibly boring and rigid so it was wonderful to get out and get to know people, like the VISTA volunteer. I got to know a family who was very involved in the ACLU through the McCarthy campaign. I got to know some other&#8211;. I&#8217;m trying to think of who&#8211;. But anyway, those personal relationships were really what it was all about. To share and explore the meaning of activism and shared activism was very exciting and very meaningful.
SCB: Did you feel like you had more of a community of activists when you began undergraduate work?
AC: Yes. I felt like I had more opportunity because I left my house and my parents weren&#8217;t constantly [Laughs] telling me I couldn&#8217;t do this or I couldn&#8217;t do that, so I had more opportunity but it was also in a better environment where there was a lot of organizing around feminist issues, anti-war issues, constant organizing. It was everywhere, all at once. I look back at it and I think it was a really lucky time to be growing up because the counterculture was so strong and it was so&#8211;It seemed to me like&#8211;Who says this? Somebody says this about history. It seemed like it was touching down, like we could really shape the outcome of the war, for example. It seemed possible because it just felt like everyone was mobilized and everybody was trying to make a difference on that particular issue, but also civil rights issues and feminist issues too. It seemed like youth were really taking history in their hands. I took a women&#8217;s history course too at IU and that helped motivate me too more around feminist issues, and then I got to know people active in different feminist networks on campus, so there was more opportunity to meet and get to know people closely who were active in different issues.
SCB: Are there any particular activities that you took part in&#8211;in those circles&#8211;that you remember?
AC: I took part in quite a few marches on Washington. We would pile in the back of U-Haul trailers. Somebody would drive and we would jam a bunch of people in the back of trailers and drive out to Washington, DC and go to these big marches. So those were important and formative. I was involved in know-your-body kinds of&#8211;like Our Bodies, Ourselves kind of gatherings&#8211;where we&#8217;d look at each other&#8217;s bodies and learn about the body and learn about women&#8217;s health, those kinds of things. But another thing about all this is that politics didn&#8217;t seem separate from life at that time&#8211;it seems to have become separate after that period of time&#8211;I think because youth were so mobilized [being at] college seemed boring again, [Laughs] but people were learning and educating themselves about different things and active to try to create different futures, particularly against the war but also about women&#8217;s health. It just seemed like, oh, this is so logical and this is so going to happen, which of course certain things did happen, but my vision of what was going to happen was much grander than what did happen in terms of women having a right to their own bodies and such. Certain progress was made but a lot of backlash happened as well.
SCB: In the same year as Roe v. Wade there was the Helms Amendment and then the Hyde Amendment in &#8217;76.
AC: Yeah. It&#8217;s pretty discouraging to see how that all plays out historically because at the moment to me it seemed like it&#8217;s obvious that women should have control of their bodies and that women should get equal pay for the same work. It just seemed so obvious, and of course history shows us otherwise.
SCB: So you mentioned workplace equality or discrimination in job application processes. Once you started applying to jobs were you confronted with that and how did you engage in that process?
AC: Yeah. I really went on a mission about this after I dropped&#8211;. I went to college for a couple years. I worked ever since I was sixteen, so I worked in restaurants and fast food and&#8211;where else did I work?&#8211;I babysat when I was even younger than the working age, so I&#8217;d been working always. I worked in a library in college, a couple of things in college, but after I dropped out, around 1972, I really started pushing to find jobs&#8211;. And this is partly because my dad had taught me to work with tools and I was kind of mechanical and mathematical, I liked that kind of thing, and so I started to push against and look for jobs where women were excluded, because I thought, it&#8217;s just that simple. Women have to get those jobs and get in them. [Laughs] My dog&#8217;s grumpy. [Dog can be heard panting heavily in the background]  So, how did that&#8211;? I guess I was painting&#8211;. When I dropped out of college I was painting some houses for a guy who was a slum lord. He had some houses that he was renting to college students and I did quite a few things for him like painting and ordinary things. Then he said he had this house that he needed rewired, so I said, well, I can rewire the house, and I got this idea to be an electrician. I guess from that I applied to somehow&#8211;How did that work? Oh, so I started working as an electrician and doing quite a few jobs around there and learning how to be an electrician through doing it, and it was a couple years later when I moved back to Indianapolis that I thought, well, if I could get in the union and open those jobs up to women then that would help with this question of equal pay for equal work, because it seemed to me women were so ghettoized in certain jobs and we need to open up those jobs. And of course it was happening on the East Coast and the West Coast so I saw that too and I thought it would be pretty simple to get in those jobs and open the door up.   But I ended up suing the state of Indiana because the state of Indiana controlled the testing that then would allow you to get into these apprenticeships. The state of Indiana had testing for more than three hundred apprenticeships, and when I went in to apply to take the test as an electrician they told me all I could do was take the test for two of those. They said the rest of them were reserved for men. So they wanted me to take the test to be a beautician or an upholsterer [Laughs] and I sued them. It didn&#8217;t go to court until about four years later because I had the lawyers through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, so by the time it actually went to court I had already been in the apprenticeship and I was already an electrician, but the court case was kind of interesting.   Anyway, I guess I got on this campaign. I sued the state of Indiana. I sued UPS because I had a summer job&#8211;. At the time when you were in college you could get this summer job delivering mail and it was better pay than anywhere else, so you could go for your summer vacation and deliver mail and I was driving a truck and delivering the mail. A friend that I was working with there said when his ninety days were up he was going to go over and work at UPS and I said, well, I&#8217;ll go over and apply too, and when I got over there they said, well, they didn&#8217;t need any secretaries. So I decided to sue them too, and then I kept looking around for jobs like that. Eventually I went to work for UPS for a while, but I think I&#8211;. Maybe that was part of me suing them. They were having people sue them all over, I think, because they were trying to keep it as a male job for a while.
SCB: So when your cases, especially against the state of Indiana, began to be adjudicated, on what grounds did you argue for workplace equality, or did the lawyers argue?
AC: Hmm. It was&#8211;. How did that work? It was federal court and my lawyers were from the EEOC. We went to&#8211;. What was that? [Pause] I can&#8217;t recall. How did that work? [Laughs] I think it was all wrapped up with that taking of the civil rights law and applying affirmative action more broadly to women. I have funny stuff that happened along the way, because I&#8217;d already entered the apprenticeship. I&#8217;d maybe gone through the whole apprenticeship at that point because it took a long time to get to court. So the funniest thing was that my mom testified in the court case, because the guy at the Indiana unemployment office, the testing guy, the gatekeeper down there, he had called my mom and tried to convince her that this was terrible, that I wasn&#8217;t going to be able to wear my pretty dresses if I was in construction sites, and all this stuff. So she testified before the court, and other people [testified], so all this testimony about the fact that I could do the job and they weren&#8217;t letting me take the test. How was that? By the time I went to court they had opened all the testing, recognizing that it was illegal to keep some of those jobs as male only.   But the funny part of the whole story was that after a couple days of testimony, this judge apparently was the worst judge I could have gotten, so he heard the testimony and then he disappeared in the back of his courtroom to take a break before he gave the decision. He came back, and my mom&#8217;s still there, and the lawyers are there, and I had dressed up a lot to be in court. I think I borrowed a matching suit from my sister with a skirt and a suit jacket. So the judge comes back and his decision was, after a couple days of testimony, his decision was that it was all about my name. He said he&#8217;d been mulling it over and he&#8217;d been in his chamber, thinking about what to do, and he looked in his dictionary of names and he couldn&#8217;t find Altha in the dictionary of names, and we hadn&#8217;t presented any evidence as to whether I was female or male, and Altha wasn&#8217;t in his dictionary of names, so clearly it wasn&#8217;t sex discrimination if we hadn&#8217;t presented evidence that I was female. [Laughs] So he decided against me. The funny part was that my mom had named me for her mom. Her name was Altha, and it&#8217;s this nineteenth century novel that wasn&#8217;t written very well, that&#8217;s why you&#8217;ve never heard of the novel named Altha. But her mom was named for this nineteenth century novel, Altha, and so my mom went into hysterics that this guy was making fun of my name and her mom&#8217;s name, [Laughs] and so here&#8217;s this judge trying to be judge-ly and my mom just&#8211;. [Screams] She started screaming. [Laughter] She had to be escorted out of the courtroom because she was so upset that this judge was making fun of my name. So, that&#8217;s probably my best story about all that. [Laughs]
SCB: Oh, gosh. How do you appeal something like that? &#8220;The judge made fun of my name in his decision.&#8221;
AC: We could have easily, according to the lawyers&#8211;. I don&#8217;t really respect the law, because it&#8217;s so silly, but according to the lawyers we could have easily appealed it because he was just trying to cook something up to decide against me. And of course they had already opened up the testing and they had already opened up the apprenticeships and everything, in recognition of equal rights, so we could have appealed it but it was pointless because they&#8217;d changed the way they were doing things, and in central Indiana there were several women that had gotten into each of the trades, so it started to change. There was a lot of resistance but it was starting to change, little by little. [Pause; transcription suspended until 29:49]
SCB: So how long did you work as an electrician?
AC: I actually worked as an electrician in the union eleven years, and before that I had worked as an electrician probably two or three years, nonunion. That doesn&#8217;t sound right, but it must be right. It&#8217;s approximately right. But the union was, of course, wonderful in certain ways. I love unions, I grew up in a family also that understood unions and understood collective action, especially my grandfather. Anyway, we&#8217;d had a lot of strong union supporters so I was excited to be part of a union, even though they didn&#8217;t want me in a certain way. I got my first letters, &#8220;Dear Sir and Brother,&#8221; for quite a long time. [Laughs] So the union was really wonderful. I was in the IBEW construction labor union for about eleven years. I forgot your question, Sarah Catherine. [Laughs]
SCB: Oh, how long did you work as an electrician, and to follow up, did that lead you back into academic work?
AC: Okay. Toward the end of that eleven years I started realizing that I needed a few credits to have my undergraduate degree and that if I didn&#8217;t get those credits within a certain time period all the credits I had were going to disappear. So toward the end of that period I started taking night classes at IUPUI, which is a branch campus of IU, downtown Indianapolis, and put together a geography degree, which was fun. It&#8217;s an open field, and they were asking me why I didn&#8217;t go to graduate school, so I thought, well, why not go to graduate school? [Laughs] And the other thing about the construction work, it was wonderful in certain ways but it got really tiring to prove myself to different people on different jobs all the time. So that idea of how quickly things were going to change proved to be untrue in the workplace as well, that I as the woman on the job always had to go out and be the best and always had to prove myself to different bosses and prove myself to different people I was working with, so that was really tiresome.   Later, when I got into academia, I explored different topics and I did a dissertation about the global factory, which is all about how certain jobs become gendered, how certain jobs get tied to or get specified as female or male, so I see all these connections now but I didn&#8217;t see all those connections when I first went into academia. I thought I was starting a new career and getting out of that having-to-prove-myself situation. But now I see all these connections between the academic work I do and the work that I was doing then in trying to broaden workplace rights, or whatever you call that. [Laughs] I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d call that.
SCB: Two things, if you can speak to any specific connections between how your activist electrician work and your academic work connect, what ways you were pressured to be the best, as a woman, how was your work devalued, or why you felt you had to be the best at your job.
AC: Yeah. It was often a hostile environment, and I knew that going in, so it played out&#8211;. And the way the construction union works is you&#8217;re in there with several thousand people, you report for work, so in the hiring hall they&#8217;ll match you up with an employer and you&#8217;ll have that employer and go to that job site until that place gets built or gets remodeled or whatever&#8217;s happening, and then you go back and get another employer. So in some cases it was extremely hostile, in other cases it was in the middle, and sometimes there would be people who tried to take me under their wing too. So it was really a full spectrum but always, always, always being the freak on the job. You&#8217;re a woman; you&#8217;re the freak of some sort or another.   So how did that play out? Sometimes one guy playing a joke on somebody else, like I&#8217;m going to send them this apprentice and see what he does and not even tell him who this is. So early on in my career as an electrician, in the downtown they put up lights on the soldiers&#8217; and sailors&#8217; monument on the circle downtown, and they put up these lights and put them up with a winch and pulled them up to the top of the monument. They knew that the guy who was doing that wouldn&#8217;t enjoy having a woman on his crew so they sent me out there just to see what he would do, and I had to endure his hostility and show him day after day that I could do the job and we&#8217;d get the lights up there. Then little by little I pieced together that people were playing a joke on him. So I felt I always had to be a good sport about these kinds of jokes, because joking is part of how you get construction work done, but often I was the butt of the joke [Laughs] rather than getting to enjoy the joke. And people would play tricks on me, like ask me to go get something in a room where there were lots of pornographic pictures on the wall, or stuff like that.   But the way it seemed overall to me was simply that I had to keep in mind that there was a larger purpose, that they were keeping these good jobs for themselves and the skills themselves. I thought it was important that women learn how to use tools and learn how to build things. It&#8217;s a wonderful thing to see how things work and be able to put things together or take things apart, which I learned early on in my home because my dad liked to mess around with tools and really shared that with me. Maybe that wouldn&#8217;t happen if I had a brother, I don&#8217;t know. My sister and I were talking the other day about the family makeup and how on my mom&#8217;s&#8211;like my grandparents. My grandfather, Harry, grew up in a family with mostly boys and so he seemed comfortable doing household tasks and sharing household tasks. And then I asked my sister about, well, why was my dad like that, because he knitted things when we were small and would cook, he had certain things he liked to cook, and we weren&#8217;t sure about my dad.   But anyway, back to being an activist electrician. It seemed to me important to prove myself, but tiresome, you know. [Laughs] After I kept proving myself you&#8217;d think there would be some limit. I got through the whole apprenticeship and you&#8217;d think then I could be the person on the job who&#8217;s training the apprentice, but I&#8217;m still the woman on the job. [Laughs] Does that answer your question?  SCB: Yeah.   AC: I wish I had better memory. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m going to remember a zillion things after we talk. [Laughs]  SCB: You can always tell me, informally.  AC: Good. Talk. [Laughs]  SCB: So I&#8217;m interested in how, throughout this process and throughout your life, your feminism has changed, from being a high school student or being raised in a feminism vocabulary-free household into doing on a daily basis activism as a female employee, has shaped your idea of what feminism means to you.  AC: Yeah. I feel I&#8217;ve learned a lot by being in the academy, not so much that it&#8217;s a perfect place but that it&#8217;s allowed me to do my own research and get excited about and understand more deeply the kinds of barriers I encountered in the electrician days and the anti-war days. I mean some of those barriers were pretty evident but some of those other barriers didn&#8217;t make so much sense to me, like why jobs get so entrenched, why masculinity and femininity itself get so wrapped up in notions of certain activity, and why people are so resistant to that. The fact that that couldn&#8217;t change more easily was interesting to explore in an academic way by digging into the global factories, the maquilas at the US-Mexico border, and seeing that process in a historical and geographical way, seeing that re-composition of young women being pulled into factories, much like they were in Massachusetts when young women were being pulled in to do work. So, anyway, I forgot what the question was. [Laughs]  SCB: That&#8217;s right. [Laughs]  AC: Do you remember what it was?  SCB: I&#8217;m interested in whether you can even compare your current feminism to what it was when you were an electrician or to when you were a high school student.  AC: Yeah.  SCB: How has academic work, and continuing to be an activist as an academic, changed your feminism?  AC: Yeah. Hmm.  SCB: Or if that&#8217;s connected [42:48] you&#8217;re doing right now.  AC: I think my feminism and my commitments to activism are being renewed in a wonderful way, just by getting more involved in activism, and probably throughout my life there have been spells in which I feel more active and less active. So academia&#8217;s been an opportunity to deepen my understanding to do research but it&#8217;s also been an opportunity to find new kinds of activism, to understand intersectionality&#8211;the word we have for that now&#8211;of race and the way that race and gender and anti-imperialist struggle and all these different struggles, how these different struggles come together. It&#8217;s been very helpful to theorize that, to understand how people theorize that, but to also then renew my feminism with new struggles, such as the way that I met Sarah Catherine, my interviewer, in working on issues around the university itself and the way that the university&#8217;s becoming more a corporation and we&#8217;re trying to hold the university to more of its mission as a public resource. But, back to Sarah Catherine, I&#8217;ve also been inspired [by] her work around gender violence and interpersonal violence and I&#8217;ve learned a lot and been inspired by that.   So, in the period that I&#8217;ve been an academic, there have been moments when I&#8217;ve been more active and moments when I&#8217;ve been less active but I value that, I treasure that, when I find new ways to be active and connected to people and feeling like my life has meaning, all these things. When I&#8217;m active I feel like my own life has meaning, like there is the possibility to shape my own future and collective futures. It&#8217;s good to remember that, through joining with others. There are lots of different issues but I&#8217;ve been particularly inspired around the issues&#8211;. And I was shocked. I&#8217;ve got to say, it wasn&#8217;t just that I was inspired this past spring. I was also shocked that some of the things that I thought were over and done in the &#8217;60s were still happening on college campuses. I was really shocked. So the two things at once have really been important to me this year, about the kinds of issues that especially young women are facing&#8211;young people, but especially young women are facing&#8211;on college campuses. I just thought that was old history. [Laughs]  SCB: To give the listeners some context, this spring, and last fall as well, several students have filed complaints against the university and now the university is in the process of revising its sexual assault policies to comply with Title IX and the Clery Act and other nondiscrimination policies, which leads me to another question. You&#8217;ve spent your adult life in a time when Title IX has been implemented, and you spoke just now about how it&#8217;s interesting to see how we&#8217;re still struggling with things that should have been over and done. Was Title IX a big event for you, having that in place?  AC: Yeah, I was aware of it, but it didn&#8217;t seem like such a big event. It seemed like part of a larger flow of things, a larger, huge change that I felt was so obvious. So clearly I was aware of that but less aware of the kind of backlash that was happening, less aware of the way things were sliding in a different direction, because in particular I felt like we had won these battles. That is, women had won these battles in the &#8217;60s about not re-victimizing survivors of sexual assault. It seemed like we had taught judges and lawyers not to re-victimize survivors in the courtroom and we&#8217;d taught even newspapers and mass media these important lessons, and all of a sudden&#8211;. That&#8217;s why I was so shocked last spring to realize all around me, on a public college campus, these things that I thought were history were very current in terms of re-victimization, and re-victimization by the people I least expected, the university staff.   So back to this question, Title IX&#8217;s forty years old, right, and the Clery Act is twenty years old, so it seemed like those broader kinds of shifts and broader kinds of education that had happened around sexual violence and about re-victimization, it seemed so sad and shocking to me that&#8211;. And apparently on lots and lots of public campuses and private campuses this is happening, this epidemic of rape culture is happening, and being permitted by administrators who&#8217;d rather sell their brand and keep things quiet rather than actually protect all students. I don&#8217;t know, it just kind of&#8211;. [Laughs] I&#8217;m still shocked about it. I still don&#8217;t have a way to make sense of all that, other than that I need to be more historical. [Laughs] I need to develop a better sense of how history changes and how&#8211;. I mean I know it&#8217;s this dialectical process and you have to keep pushing, I know that, but in another way I obviously don&#8217;t know that. I obviously can lose sight of that sometimes.  SCB: I think, I mean even on your faculty page, doing research for this interview and when I was just getting to know you, I was like who is this Altha Cravey about, and I really appreciated seeing&#8211;. Like on your geography department web page [you say] people have a responsibility to make positive change in the world. I think that it&#8217;s important to contextualize the individual within historical processes but it&#8217;s also been, I think, important to do justice to your own work as an individual pressing for a change. Do you feel like having these cases come up so close to you has been more influential, say, than having a rash of sexual assault cases occur throughout the country?  AC: It&#8217;s actually been really good for me to see the cases but also to see the activism. It&#8217;s been really inspiring to me to see people come together and say this is not right in various ways, letters to the editor, the challenge itself, the court case challenge. How would I explain that? The challenge, it&#8217;s in the department of education, is that right?  SCB: Yeah.  AC: These claims that got my attention in the spring, [not only serve to] remind me that I am an activist and to remind me that I am a human being who can make changes with others and join with others, but [also] that I can act on my own, I can act with others, and remind me about that responsibility. Maybe those quiet periods for me are when I&#8217;m discouraged or not as connected to people who share those values with me, because now I feel like I&#8217;ve got reconnected with some of those people who share my values, and it seems hard to imagine that I&#8217;d get away from that again, but probably I&#8217;ll have some more dips [Laughs] in my life. But, yeah, it&#8217;s good to think about.  SCB: One thing I&#8217;m interested in is a point of personal advice, how you seem to get back into those circles or connect with people again, if there&#8217;s ever actions one can take to get back to connect with people that way, because I&#8217;d like to continue to connect with people.  AC: Yeah. [Dogs barking; pause; attempting to quiet dogs] I think it&#8217;s&#8211;. [Pause] The dogs are reacting to noises. I&#8217;d like to continue to&#8211;. [Dog growling; attempts to quiet the dog] I don&#8217;t have a good answer, but I feel the same way. I want to have an impact. I want to be around people that get me energized. I want to spend less time with people who don&#8217;t share my values, where I don&#8217;t feel energized. I think partly I&#8217;ve got to make those decisions, I&#8217;ve got to remember to make those decisions, and also not to be too hard on myself, which I recommend to you too since you asked for advice, if that&#8217;s the right word. You&#8217;ve got to be good to yourself and let yourself grow and not criticize yourself too much. Sometimes my low periods are when I&#8217;m criticizing myself too much and not just finding the people that share my values and doing whatever it is with them that makes me feel alive, whether it&#8217;s activism or whether it&#8217;s dancing, and those things should be all&#8211;. I think they should be all wrapped up together, the joys of activism and the joys of dancing&#8211;and poetry for you&#8211;those skills that each of us have. Our lives in the modern world are so compartmentalized and that&#8217;s so dehumanizing, to put these different parts of our lives in these different little boxes. [Break in recording]  SCB: Okay, it&#8217;s recording now. I wanted to ask you before we wrap up if there&#8217;s anything I didn&#8217;t ask you that you&#8217;d like to speak about or you&#8217;d like to add?  AC: Well, I think that last question&#8211;. This has really been fun and your questions have been really fun, but the last one is particularly fun to think about: How do we live life to the fullest? How do we contribute that which we have to contribute? And I think it&#8217;s such a challenge, especially in the modern world. There&#8217;s a lot of ways in which the culture really isn&#8217;t about living life to the fullest, so there&#8217;s a lot of different things we have to work against, and we can get lessons from travel, which has been another benefit of being in academia, the benefit of being able to explore people in other countries, incorporate that into my intellectual project and get inspiration from people elsewhere who don&#8217;t live such compartmentalized lives as the modern world forces us to do. So that last question is particularly inspiring, to think, well, how do we keep ourselves alive to the fullest, and how do we find the people who help us find that joy and that activism? I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s ever going to be any simple answer. Probably we just keep figuring it out as we live, each of us, wherever we are. But it&#8217;s been fun to do this interview, especially with you, Sarah Catherine, so that&#8217;s probably what I&#8217;d like to say last.  SCB: Thank you very much. Your responses have been great and I really appreciate the opportunity to get to know you better. I mean this interview is the premise for learning more about your life, and I think you&#8217;re very right about figuring out what&#8217;s good for someone where they are in their life and where they are among people. Thank you for helping me in this process, not just throughout the spring but in the interview.  AC: Okay.  SCB: Over and out!
