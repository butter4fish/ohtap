Story_ID: 532362
Speaker 1: Now, well I'm going to ask about your family history.  I'm going to ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side [John B. Cruz, Jr.].  But we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Madeline, M-A-D-E-L-I-N-E.  Madeline, her maiden name was Martin, M-A-R-T-I-N [Madeline Martin Allen], before she married my father.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her place of birth is Freetown, Massachusetts, and her date of birth was April 1, 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace that side?
Speaker 2: I can trace it back to my grandfather [Casimere Martin], I can trace it back to my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's as far back as you can go?
Speaker 2: Well, of anybody that I knew.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean, yeah, I can trace it further back than that.  But it goes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well--
Speaker 2: --back to the Cape Verde islands, where my grandmother [Mary Andrews Martin] and my grandfather on my mother's side emigrated from.  They came from the Cape Verde islands and settled here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did they come over?
Speaker 2: They came over here probably in the early 1900s.  I don't know exactly when, but 1910 or something like that, as very, you know, youngsters.  They were, my grandmother was a young teenager when she came over; I don't know the exact age.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories in the family about life in the Cape Verdes before they came over, or as to how they came (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.  Well, they came over here because life was so hard.  They were very poor.  Cape Verdes is a poor colony that once was owned by the Portuguese, who really didn't do much for it.  It was basically an African colony, and they were experiencing severe droughts.  And so there was a lot of hard--conditions were harsh.  So they came looking for life in America, where it was better.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it easy to get passage to America?  Or do you know anything about that--how they got (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, it was--it wasn't easy to get passage, because they came over on sailboats.  That's how they came over then, in small boats.  And they used to come into dock, most of them, in the town called New Bedford here in Massachusetts, which was known for--a lot of Cape Verdeans were fishermen, and a lot of Cape Verdeans were whalers.  My great-grandfather on my mother's--I mean my great uncle, not my great--was actually a whaler.  And a lot of the--because it was dangerous work, a lot of the harpoonists they show in pictures were actually blacks; they were Cape Verdeans.  And they were the guys in the little small boat, throwing the spear.  And a lot of the guys on those boats were sort of at the bottom of the ladder.  They had to take a risk by going out in those small boats and, you know, sometimes chasing a whale for two or three hours, and maybe sometimes a day.  So, I have a great uncle who I remember as a child going in his house and looking up over his fireplace and seeing a harpoon.  I don't know if anybody ever got a chance to save it.  Hopefully they did, but--
Speaker 1: Now, that's quite a story.  That's something that I, you know, never heard before.  That's, yeah, so probably, I would guess that--.  So the family has a history of sailing and being involved in the--?
Speaker 2: All of the--not all of them.  A lot of Cape Verdeans, when they settled in New Bedford, which was a whaling town, took up the fishing or the boating industry, and so they were associated with the sea.  Because at Cape Verdes islands they were--to get around, and because there were so many islands, you had to be proficient in boating of some sort.  So, they were used to being on the seas.
Story_ID: 532363
Speaker 1: There any stories--I think I was starting to ask you if there were any stories about the Cape Verdes [Cape Verde] that your [maternal] grandparents [Mary Andrews Martin and Casimere Martin] told, or any stories you heard about what life was like on the Cape Verdes islands themselves?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Again, it was very harsh and cruel.  And I can remember my grandmother telling me about how hard times were there, and how little food there was to go around because of the droughts, and how hard it was.  It was a rocky, arid kind of--because of the droughts.  And they lived in--you know, basically no roads, no lights.  So America was a place that beckoned them for a bigger--and I can remember being--sort of tended to watch the vegetables, because the monkeys and the wild goats used to come down and eat the food (laughter).  So her job as a young girl was to keep the animals out of the farm.  So, this was one of the stories.
Story_ID: 532364
Speaker 1: So did your mother [Madeline Martin Allen] grow up in Massachusetts (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Here in Wareham [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: In Wareham.  She was born in Freetown [Massachusetts] and--
Speaker 1: In Freetown.
Speaker 2: --grew up in Wareham.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did she talk about growing up?  Did she grow up basically in a Cape Verdean community or?
Speaker 2: Yes.  It was a Cape Verdean community, and it was, and it is still is to some degree, a very tight knit community because of the language barrier.  They spoke a form of Creole.  It was a combination of Portuguese and the language in the Cape Verdes [Cape Verde] islands.  And so there was a language barrier, and naturally people migrate to where they can speak to other people.  So, there was a large Cape Verdean community, in fact, the largest in the country.  I still think it is still the same today is here in New England.  And it really is based out of immigrants coming in through New Bedford [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Providence, Rhode Island, I should say that, too.  Both of those ports, you had boats from Cape Verdes come in with immigrants.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it, was it tough for her to adjust to conditions here?  I mean, or was it pretty easy because of the large community?
Speaker 2: Well, because of the large community, there was always a kind of communal kind of thing where families back then--no matter I think where they were, helped each other out, and made it easier for whoever they could, for members of the Cape Verdean community.  And there was work around, not that it was well paying, because they were fishermen who could go out on the sea.  You know, there was a living there.  And a lot of them worked in the textile mills.  So, they were cheap labor for a lot of the industries that were going on in Massachusetts, like I said, especially the mills in the New Bedford, Falls River [Fall Rivers, Massachusetts].  That's where at one time the textile mills were located before they moved down south.  So, it did add an outlet for employment.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was the community mostly Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was mostly a Catholic community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My grandfather [Casimere Martin] happened to be Protestant on my mother's side.  But most of the Cape Verdean community was Catholic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was your mother able to--did she attend public school or Catholic school?
Speaker 2: She attended public schools.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But like most poor people and Cape Verdeans back then, very few people graduated, because they had to go out and get a job to support the family.  On my mother's side they had twelve children, and on my father's [John B. Cruz, Jr.] side they had nine.  So, they were both large families.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did she have to work, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, she--
Speaker 1: Before she finished, so--
Speaker 2: --she, she dropped out of school and went to work.
Speaker 1: What did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: She worked in kitchens, waitress, that kind of thing, housekeeping.
Story_ID: 532365
Speaker 1: Let me ask about your father's side again.  And then we'll get back to how they met, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: But can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: John B., same Bert, middle initial, Cruz.  And he's Jr. [John B. Cruz, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: May 31, 1919.  I'm sorry, May 30th, not 31st.  May 30, 1919.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was he born?
Speaker 2: He was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what do you know about your father's side of the family?
Speaker 2: Well, my father's side of the family actually has been here in America longer than a lot of Cape Verdeans.  My grandfather was actually born here in America, in New Bedford.  And his father came over from the Cape Verde islands.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, your great-grandfather came over--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --from Cape Verde.  And what did they do?  Did they, were they involved in fishing and boating, and that sort of thing?
Speaker 2: For a while.  But my grandfather ended up owning a grocery package store.  He moved to Wareham [Massachusetts], where again, most of the family was born, and opened up a--he used to have a little store in New Bedford at one time.  And then moved to Wareham and opened up a store which eventually became a store and a package store, which has beer and wine license, but no hard liquor.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Are there any stories from your grandfather about, you know, life--
Speaker 2: I always--well, first of all, there are the stories that he was associated with the Kennedys.  And the part of the history that we talk about is Prohibition.  My grandfather was a bootlegger, allegedly, that worked for whoever was running the liquor business down in the Cape Cod [Massachusetts] area, and used to distribute to all of the black owned clubs and resorts, or whatever.  But he was the person that delivered during the Prohibition times, liquor to various black owned establishments.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's interesting, because we were discussing before I started the interview about the illegal sources of income for the black community (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: And how that--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: That's always a path open--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to people, and even in those days of Prohibition, you know.  And not only black folks, but it's a well known fact now that Joseph Kennedy [Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.] was very much involved in bootlegging during Prohibition, made a lot of money (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, that's who my grandfather worked for.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: That's exactly--now that you've said it, that's exactly who he worked for (laughter).  And that was one of the reasons a black man was able, way back when, when liquor became legal again he was able to get a package store license.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  That's very--yeah, a very clear connection he had.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was the mayor of the black section of Wareham.  It's called Onset [Wareham, Massachusetts], a very--actually a very pretty section.  And although it may be poor, it has one of the greatest beaches on the cape, the Onset Beach [Wareham, Massachusetts].  But that was--parts of that area were where the blacks used to live, it was called Jungle Town.  That was the slang name, you know, that's where all the blacks lived.  And my father had--I mean my grandfather--had the package and grocery store, and he was basically the mayor of the town.  He was the most important prominent black person in Onset.  And he used to do a lot of the politicking for--even though he wasn't elected, his constituency used to represent the black Cape Verdean community.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is--so this is John B. Cruz, Sr. (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, John B. Cruz, Sr.
Speaker 1: All right.  So--
Speaker 2: And his name is also John B. Cruz, Bert.  But he's Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There is no IV (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, not yet okay, no IV.
Story_ID: 532366
Speaker 1: So, did he have any stories about these days?  Now, these are--you know, bootlegging is a risky business on some level.  And, and, there are, as we've noted here, some politics involved in it.  Did he have any stories that you remember about--?
Speaker 2: Not that I remember.  But what my aunts and my uncles tell me, he could be gone for a month, month and a half, and you wouldn't see him, because you know, he was underground and out of sight, delivering.  So, you know, their father [John B. Cruz, Sr.] during those times was a guy that, like I said, would just be gone for a period of time while he was carrying out certain business, and then he'd come back.
Speaker 1: Did they make the deliveries near the waterways, or by land?
Speaker 2: Nobody's ever gotten into it.  It was a combination of both, from what we're told.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any stories about the Kennedys at all?  Joseph Kennedy [Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, just that that was his connection to the bootlegging trade.  That was definitely the contact of who he distributed for.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It's interesting.  We know that Joseph Kennedy became an ambassador, and was in the highest levels of world government as a result of this--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --fortune he made (laughter), and the connections he made through marriage and so forth.
Speaker 2: I'm sure if my grandfather had been white, he would have been elevated, and probably would have had more opportunities to do.  As it was, I mean he was credited with being, you know, a significant contributor and achiever that time for a black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was your grandfather a Catholic?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: On my father's side, they were Catholic.
Speaker 1: Was your father [John B. Cruz, Jr.], was he able to finish school when he came along?
Speaker 2: My father?  No, he finished after service; he went into the [U.S. military] service.  And again, the thing about my grandfather--I have a picture out there that you can see.  He was the cleanest dude in town [Wareham, Massachusetts].  He, I always remember him with his spats, his ties; he had suspenders and smoked a cigar, and had his fedora.  He was my impression--I was always impressed I think with a flair for fashion that I actually got from my grandfather.  Because people used to always--they called him, his nickname was Bertise [ph.].  And he was always--people always complimented him on the way he looked.  He looked very stylish and debonair, and very prominent.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any other stories about him?  I mean, it seems like there's some--
Speaker 2: Well, the kind of stories (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I don't want to miss anything.
Speaker 2: Those kind of stories (laughter), I can't repeat it; my family might shoot me.  He was a little bit of a womanizer, let's put it that way.  I can--and I'm not saying it was right, but I'm just saying that's--. I can remember going to a funeral when I was in my--oh, I was at least, I was in my forties.  And one of my aunts died, and I may have been in my early forties.  And I go to the funeral and, lo and behold, I find out I have another aunt that I never knew anything about, that my grandfather had fathered a child late in life.  He was like in his sixties or something, because this woman is my age.  So, he was quite a ladies' man evidently.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, money and good looks.  I mean, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  He had clout.  And so--
Speaker 1: You would expect that the mayor of the black section of town probably would--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, have a lot of connections.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right.  And so, he evidently took advantage of his position of power.
Speaker 1: What kind of car did he drive?
Speaker 2: He had an old Packard.  He might have had another one, but the old big Packard.  He always drove a nice car.  It went with his looks and his position, I guess.  Always had a nice car.  Like I said, smoked a--he loved kids, and would take us with him every little chance he got.  And I always remember that on Friday or Saturdays he would pile us in the car and take us down for fried clams.  So, he was a generous man.  And again, I talked about the work ethic.  If we wanted something out of the store, he would give it to us, but we had to work for it.  If you wanted a bottle of pop or soda or whatever, you had to at least sweep the floors once a week for him, or do something.  And those were the lessons in life.  Again, were good lessons.  We didn't know we were getting a lesson in life then (laughter).  But again, he would have something for you, but he let you know that nothing was free.
Story_ID: 532367
Speaker 1: What stories did your father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] tell of growing up?
Speaker 2: Of him [Cruz's paternal grandfather, John B. Cruz, Sr.] being a very hard disciplinarian.  And I'm assuming because he was away so long that--you know, he might have been gone away for a while.  But everything had better be in its place, and everybody has to do what they should do, or they would pay for it.  He was a very hard disciplinarian and wouldn't hesitate, like a lot of people then, to take the rod to you, or a belt, if you got out of line.  So there were no problem with any of the boys, my uncles, growing up.  And pushed them for schooling.  He did push that as much as he could.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were the schools integrated in Wareham [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Well, the elementary school was basically all black that they went to in the Onset section [Wareham, Massachusetts].  I don't know if they were prohibited from actually going to the other one, I don't think there was any of that.  Just by design it was, you know, segregated, but not, not so in your face.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It was the neighborhood school do?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the neighborhood school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But the high school was--
Speaker 2: The high school was integrated.  And again, my grandfather did push everyone to go to school.  And mostly everybody did go to school on my father's side, at least high school.  And I have one aunt that went to college, Bridgewater State College [Bridgewater State University, Bridgewater, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Yeah, did your father discuss what his aspirations were in high school, what he wanted to do?
Speaker 2: Actually (laughter) he wanted to be, he loved to dance.  He actually thought of being a dancer.  He's a terrific dancer, I mean a terrific dancer.  But back in those days, you know, you probably were considered gay if you ever told anybody you wanted to dance (laughter).  And how many blacks could get a job dancing?  But he was, he was known back then for being a terrific dancer, until his recent bout with Parkinson's.  We have pictures of him dancing.  And again, he's got a region wide reputation for dancing.  This past October, we gave him a gala where we were raising money for Bridgewater State College.  And almost everybody at the gala comments, "Is your father still that terrific dancer that he was?"
Story_ID: 532368
Speaker 1: So, was he [Cruz's father, John B. Cruz, Jr.] groomed to take over the store, you know, from his father [John B. Cruz, Sr.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he didn't particularly groom anyone to take over the store, at least I don't recall anybody; he wanted them to go out.  And, again, a lot of Cape Verdeans back then had the biggest opportunities in construction, either on the road, or there was an [U.S.] Air Force base down there, Camp Edwards [Massachusetts].  So they were always building something down there, so there were some opportunities for the shipbuilding.  My father worked as a shipbuilder for a while.  He worked at Otis Air Force Base [Otis Air National Guard Base, Massachusetts] as a carpenter.  And then he came up to Boston [Massachusetts] to seek work as a carpenter.  Because the store wasn't that big, you know, because, again, its basic clients were just the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So--
Speaker 1: And most of the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So he did all right. I mean he had a nice house.
Speaker 1: Yeah, the economy was underground rather than over ground anyway (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.  And he wasn't getting any white clients to drive into Onset [Wareham, Massachusetts] to go shopping in his store.  I'd say, you know, it might have happened, but not--it wasn't that he was--probably 95 percent of his traffic was Cape Verdeans.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I just thought of this.  I mean, you know, when Prohibition was over, did that really--I mean that must have hurt your grandfather's--well, his income.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So what did he--
Speaker 2: So, again, after that is when he opened up the package store.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So, it wasn't, you know--
Speaker 2: You know, it was sort of (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, I hear what you're saying.
Speaker 2: --his reward for, you know, or his connection, through doing what he was doing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But a smaller business, than probably (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: --it was initially, I guess?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 532369
Speaker 1: Your father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] got involved in shipbuilding and carpentry?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And my, most of my uncles experienced some form of that.  There was shipbuilding; there was the Quincy shipbuilding yard [Fore River Shipyard, Quincy, Massachusetts], you know, which was up closer to Boston [Massachusetts].  But there were shipbuilding yards, and I think they even had one down in New Bedford [Massachusetts] at one time.  So, that's where a lot of them got their opportunity for work.  And again, he came up to Boston probably in the early mid-'40s [1940s].  I don't know exactly, I can ask him.  But it was around that time, because he worked in Boston for a couple, or a few years, I don't know, not that long.  But he found that, as we say, if you're black, you're the last hired and the first fired.  And was having problems keeping a steady job, so what he decided to do was try to build his own client base as a carpenter, and he started out doing little remodeling and fix up jobs.  That's what really drove him into business, his inability to get steady work. That led him to say, okay, I got a family to feed, I will stake out on my own.  And that's what he did.  As a matter of fact, you know, there are these companies track how long you've been in business, and they send you little like stickers to put on, "You've been in business X amount of years."  And anyhow, we got one.  My father has actually--it wasn't incorporated but it was doing business as, DBA, as another form.  It's not quite incorporation, but it establishes you as a business.  And that was actually 1947.  So, it's sixty years.
Story_ID: 532370
Speaker 1: So you were talking about the difficulties your father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] had in securing a job, and how that inspired him to start his own business.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's actually adversity that created the opportunity.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So was it--could he get in the union in those days?  Or did they have to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Was that a barrier?
Speaker 2: If you were in the union, again, the word was last hired, first fired.  You couldn't keep a steady job, because the minute something slowed down, if you couldn't stand the abuse that you had to take from the white carpenters or people in the union--remarks and digs--then you didn't last long.  And both my father and my uncle and a very good friend of theirs were all great carpenters with plenty of skills who could, you know, run circles around a lot of carpenters, but they just couldn't keep a job.
Speaker 1: Did they have any stories about some of the abuse they endured?
Speaker 2: Well, from the name calling, to people writing racial epithets on the job as you walk in, to, again, not being served in the same places that they could go.  And I mean not that it was legal, but people telling you, you know, they don't want you there.  So--
Speaker 1: But in terms of when it's time to eat, you can't--
Speaker 2: Yes.  So, there's--again, they don't talk about it in any great detail, but the biggest thing was the lack of money that they could make, because they couldn't keep a steady job.
Story_ID: 532371
Speaker 1: Is this like pre-war [World War II, WWII]?  I mean, I know your father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] served in the [U.S.] military.  Did he go to the [U.S.] Army, the [U.S.] Navy, or--
Speaker 2: He was in the Army.
Speaker 1: Army?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And this was, again, right at the end of it when they were--maybe some pre and some after the war (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so in the mid-'40s [1940s].  He was doing this before he went in and then after, you know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right, yes.
Speaker 1: Was he able to use his skills in the Army?
Speaker 2: Not particularly, no, not particularly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Nothing he ever talks about.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did he serve on the stateside, or did he go overseas?
Speaker 2: He served on the stateside.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He didn't go overseas.
Story_ID: 532372
Speaker 1: So when he [Cruz's father, John B. Cruz, Jr.] got out [of the U.S. Army], he was still struggling with trying to make a living as a--?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: All right.  So what was his breakthrough, in terms of--so when did he decide to start his own business?
Speaker 2: Again, when he moved up to Boston [Massachusetts] after a couple of years or so of not having steady employment, he started working for people that needed jobs done.  And it started out as just some folks in the black community hiring him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And as you said at the end of the last reel, the company [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts] was founded in 1947.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And again, so that was when he took the gamble, bit the bullet or whatever, and started peddling his own skills.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, what did the company consist of when he started it?  Was it him and your uncle, or was it--who was it?
Speaker 2: It was him and an uncle and a friend.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And they used to do a lot of storefronts, little remodeling jobs--people's houses or porch, whatever needed to be done.
Speaker 1: So, was that basically in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically in Roxbury.  And then he was able to branch out and do some work for some homebuilders, people building homes, and that brought him out to the suburbs.  And that's sort of what--when he built for some of the homebuilders and built a reputation for quality, then he was able to go to other homebuilders because he had a track record.  And so, and again, the uniqueness sometimes of being black helps you, because there's not--if you're good and you're black, the word spreads, (laughter) because there's not that many around.  So word spread that he was good, and he was able to get some work with some of the homebuilders.  And then I think, myself, at least the significant thing was he was able to get some work during the '60s [1960s] with the--there was a large apartment expansion boom here in the suburbs, and he was able to get with some of the developers who were building the complexes in the suburbs, the apartments.  And he was able to make some more money and hire some more people, because they were apartment complexes rather than, you know, a single family house, where you may have four to five guys at the most employed.  You know, when you're doing an apartment complex, you might need ten or twelve, and maybe at a certain time more than that, depending on how many apartments you were building.  So that's, at least from my perspective, when his business started to, you know, expand, and his reputation as a contractor was--grew to the white development community.  And even though he would have some people that may not use him, he had a lot of significant well known white developers that he could work for, you know, and did work for.  So, I always appreciated the fact that my father was able to get business.  And I think that instilled into me, in spite of, or even when there was not anything called affirmative action or equal opportunity or anything like that, my father made a living.  So, what it instilled in me is, yes, it's hard, but no one can stop you if you've got the determination.  That's what--that was the message I got and the lesson I learned from watching my father when I was still in high school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts].
Story_ID: 532373
Speaker 1: Is there a story that's told about how your parents [Madeline Martin Allen and John B. Cruz, Jr.] met?
Speaker 2: No, I never (laughter), I never heard that one, or either they don't want to say it.  But no, there isn't a story.  Unfortunately, they got divorced at an early age.  I was about five or maybe six.  And my father never remarried, and there is a story with that; he never remarried.  I moved to Cleveland [Ohio] for a while, and then my mother got married.  And my stepfather was from Buffalo [New York], so I actually lived in Buffalo for a while.  But my mother and my stepfather were very poor.  And unfortunately, they both had a drinking problem on top of that.  And so my mother wisely sent me to live with my father when I turned twelve, specifically because she sat me down and told me, "You'll have more opportunities to grow with your father, and he can take better care of you and provide you with schooling."  And so, you know, I always have a special place in my mother's--in my heart for my mother, because I know it must have been one of the most difficult things that she could do, was to send her son away.  But she was looking at my future.  And so I came to live with my father when I was twelve.  He was still single, he hadn't married.  And the story is that he always--somewhat like my grandfather [John B. Cruz, Sr.], except he wasn't married--had various women friends.  And so we didn't know who he was going to be with, or who you may see from one week to another, what date he may have.  And I used to answer the phone, and instead of the parents saying, "No, my son isn't home," I would be saying, "No, my father isn't home," to someone looking for him, even though he was home (laughter).  So, it was a little bit of a different household.  And although he was a strict disciplinarian--he may spend the night out, but he would be there in time to change and get ready for work, and check on you to make sure you did your homework and you had everything else before you went to school.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He never neglected that part.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you had a real bachelor father.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had a bachelor father, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was that way and I'm not praising him, but he was that way until just recently.  He's always had one or two lady friends.  So--
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, when you look at your parents' personalities, who do you think you take after the most?  I mean, I guess it should be sort of obvious in some way (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I have my mother's heart, and I have my--my mother's heart and my mother's compassion.  And I have my father's work ethic and sincerity and integrity.
Story_ID: 532374
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: I always remember growing up with a lot of love, a lot of love.  Buddhists say treasures of the heart, and I've always been a billionaire with treasures of the heart, on both sides of my family.  I just don't remember any major strife.  And they were both poor families.  Nobody--in fact, my grandfather [Casimere Martin] on my mother's [Madeline Martin Allen] side was a carpenter also.  And he did a little bit of fishing also.  So, and my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] had this store, but I mean it wasn't super profitable because you had, you know, it was in the black community, and he had a lot of kids.  So there was no, you know, luxuries around.  But again, it was just a lot of love on my mother's side, and a lot of music.  My grandfather played guitar.  And so I've always--I never felt--again, and I think it's a statement that's said a lot in old families, never felt poor.  You might have been poor, but you weren't poor, because everybody around you was at that same level.  You weren't comparing lives on TV then with something else.  And you were very--yeah nurtured.  And I'd say that's the thing I was with aunts and uncles--a very nurtured childhood.
Story_ID: 532375
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, when you were a little kid--you started in Boston [Massachusetts], right?  Were you here in Boston (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, actually we lived on the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts] until my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.]--and then when they got divorced, I actually moved with my mother [Madeline Martin Allen] and we lived in Cleveland [Ohio] for about a year.  And then the guy she married lived in Buffalo [New York], so we moved to Buffalo.  I actually lived in the mistake by the lake as I called it for a while.  (Laughter) Hopefully people will know I'm only joking (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: They'll hear this, right (laughter).  Okay, so you--do you have any memories of your early years on the cape?
Speaker 2: On the cape, yeah.  Again, that's what I'm saying.  With the cape, it was just love on both sides, a big family.  It was, I was close to my father's side and close to my mother's side.  And between the two grandmothers [Mary Andrews Martin and Caroline Cruz], I was bouncing around between the two houses.  So it was always a--like I said, just a really happy time.  And a lot of cousins, cousins coming out, five in a bed sometimes, depending on whose house you were, or four in a bed.  But we thought that was normal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You said your grandfather [Casimere Martin] played the guitar?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he played the guitar.
Speaker 1: What did he play?  Did he play popular music, or Cape Verdean music (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, all Cape Verdean songs.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: All Cape Verdean songs.  And my, still my favorite song is (speaking Spanish) 'La Cabrita de Mi'.  That's 'My Little Goat.'  And for reason that song stayed with me since--my mother used to sing it, too.
Speaker 1: How does it go?  Can you give us a little bit of it?
Speaker 2: (Singing Spanish), "La cabrita de mi," da da da da da da da.  That's just that solemn melody.  Cape Verdean songs were sort of like West African blues.  They have a melancholy kind of ring to them, "I long for the island," "I long for this."  And so, and again, I like blues, and it's sort of a West African blues.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that's interesting.  So, you were there until you were about five, you said.  And then you moved to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and then I moved to--
Speaker 1: --to Cleveland?
Speaker 2: To Cleveland for a short while.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And then to Buffalo.
Story_ID: 532376
Speaker 1: Do you have any brothers and sisters or did you have any around (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I do.  I have a sister, Faith [Faith Cruz Cogan], who my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.]--she was about a year and a half or two years older than me.  Anyhow, Faith was, is my full sister.  I also have, again, as a result of my father being a bachelor, I have two other brothers and sisters.  So, (unclear) Paul [Paul Pina], Tony [Anthony Santio], and Pamela [Pamela Lopes].  So, I have half-sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I have two brothers and one sister that my father had without marriage.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But in your household when you were growing up, was it just you and your sister, your oldest sister (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was my sister and I for a while, but two of my half-brothers and sisters came to live with us at various times.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I did grow up with like my brother Paul and my brother Tony for a while.  Tony went into the [U.S. military] service, Paul stayed.  And in fact, Paul works for the company [Cruz Companies, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts] today.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Tony doesn't.  But--
Speaker 1: All right.  So you were in Cleveland [Ohio] at age five for a short period of time, you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, just a short period of time, about a year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: It might have been even less than a year.  But then we moved to Buffalo [New York], and I was there for about four years.
Story_ID: 532377
Speaker 1: W- we always ask this question.  What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: In Cape Cod [Massachusetts], the sights and sounds were guitar music, Cape Verdean music, singing, a lot of love, and food from--my [maternal] grandfather [Casimere Martin] and grandmother [Mary Andrews Martin] had a farm, besides everything else, with chickens.  And did they have a goat at one time?  No, they didn't have a goat, but chickens and a lot of--she had a grapevine, some orchards--so a lot of canning, preserving, that old fashioned stuff, and a lot of--.  The thing I always jokingly say--in fact, with the help of my daughter [Ariane Cruz] I'm going to write a book one day called 'Red Cotton,' and it's going to be based on cranberry bogs.  Cranberry bogs is what I call red cotton.  It's where Cape Verdeans worked, but it was almost the same as the South, from what I know.  Cranberry season started in September, and it only really lasted for about a month, maybe a month and a half, 'cause the fall.  And they used to pick them with scoops.  You'd bend down, it was very hard work.  If you've never seen a cranberry scoop, they're actually worth a lot of money now.  They're historical instruments used to scoop the berries up and put them in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I think they grow in water or something, don't they?
Speaker 2: No, it's just a wooden thing, cardboard, with these little prongs.  It almost looks like a bunch of fingers, and it's a basket.  And you scoop the cranberries up and then you put them in the box.  So the Cape Verdeans were the immigrants, and a lot of them--this was the work they did.  Because it was almost like the people who would come up and pick grapes, somewhat similar to that.  And they would go around to the different bogs and pick for the owners.  And the thing about it was you would get paid at the end of the season.  And almost like the old country stores I guess down in the South, you could borrow on it from some of the borrowers [sic. lenders].  But by the end of the season you weren't getting paid, because you had borrowed it if you could.  But at the end of the season, for the people that didn't borrow it, it was payday.  And it seemed like a lot of money, and to them it was, because you got it all in one lump sum.  But really, they were getting paid little to nothing for their hard work.  They weren't getting paid much at all.  But just because they didn't get paid until the end of the season, just think of the cash flow.  The cranberry guys didn't have to pay until they sold their crop, and that's, that's how it used to go.  But that was like in the late fall when they got their money, and it was party back (laughter).  Because everybody had money, the people that worked on the bogs.  So I remember those were some of the things I remember as a child, those sort of happy, you know, happy moments.  And again, it even struck me as a child back then, because some people would actually drop out of school to go help pick cranberries to help make money for their family.  So again, it was a little, like I said, parallel to the cotton industry a little, with the poor blacks.  But instead of picking cotton, they were picking cranberries.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was it almost exclusively Cape Verdeans picking the cranberries?
Speaker 2: Yeah, almost exclusively Cape Verdeans picking cranberries.
Speaker 1: Well, what--okay, what were some of the other sights and sounds and smells of growing up (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Just the dances.  It's very--Cape Verdeans are a very musical culture, and there was always singing and dancing.  So, that's what I remember.  Again, just family structure I guess, and being around a lot of family and singing and dancing.
Story_ID: 532378
Speaker 1: School was, you know, school, at least on the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts]--I did go to school down there, you know, it was elementary school.  And so it wasn't anything special about it.  And--
Speaker 2: Well, what about--before I get into school specifically, what about Buffalo [New York]?  What was it like living in Buffalo?  Were you living in a Cape Verdean community in Buffalo too?
Speaker 1: Well, I'll tell you.  Talk about culture shock.  Coming from a pristine place--I mean that's the beginning, Cape Cod, Wareham [Massachusetts].  It's got some beautiful beaches all around Wareham.  There's lots of beaches, it's got one of the best beaches on the cape.  So, I come from basically country living, looking at the farm.  The next door neighbor two doors down had pigs.  And we used to go down and watch the pigs being slaughtered in the fall, and they would make linguica and chourico, which is Portuguese sausage.  And it's something I can remember that you didn't want to watch, but you had to watch it.  When they would slaughter the pigs and drain the blood out, then they would wash the pots in vinegar and then you'd see the woman stuffing the sausage into the casing.  And you could smell--you'd see the blood and you'd smell the vinegar, and you'd say, "Why am I watching this thing as a kid?"  (Laughter) But you know, whatever it was, that's what you did.  So, I mean, but it was a lot of hands-on.  And then my [maternal] grandmother [Mary Andrews Martin] and all of the women down there at that time canned.  And you'd go down in someone's cellar and you'd find everything from relish to jams to corn.  Anything they could can, they canned.  Because, again, they didn't have a lot of money, and they depended on the farming for the--to nurture them.  And what's the other question?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was asking you the contrast between Buffalo and that country living (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so Buffalo, then I moved to--and Cleveland [Ohio] wasn't that bad.  We didn't stay there that long, like I said.  I remember my mother working in nightclubs at that time, right there on Euclid Avenue.  I remember Euclid Avenue, and I remember the bright lights walking down there as a kid.  I remember all the name stars, and my aunt did too, all the black stars that used to come through there, and having them tell us about them.  And my mother [Madeline Martin Allen] was a very attractive woman, and so was my aunt, so they had no problem getting a job as a waitress.  And, you know, they dressed nice, too, as she told me (laughter).
Story_ID: 532379
Speaker 1: And so then we moved to Buffalo [New York], and that was a culture shock to me.  I just, I mean we were poor.  And I moved from this pristine place where I could walk to a saltwater beach, and where there was a small river in the back of the house where we used to go swimming, and I got to Buffalo and the lake was polluted even then (laughter).  And we just, I jokingly say I love my mother [Madeline Martin Allen] and my stepfather to death, but they were poor.  Where we lived, depending on which way the wind was blowing--first of all, Buffalo was near Lackawanna [New York], which was a big, big, steel town.  So, you could smell the smell coming over there.  I mean I'd never--it was almost--I'd never seen anything like that.  When I was a kid I went by, and I was like "When does it stop?"  It was just mill after mill after mill, and there was always these spouting fumes.  And in Buffalo they had steel mills.  So, we lived between a steel mill and a brewery. And I remember today the Iroquois brewery [Iroquois Brewing Company, Buffalo, New York].  I don't know if it's still around, but Iroquois--there's a picture of the Native American on there--and Barn Bread [ph.].  So depending--in a rundown neighborhood.  If you're sitting between there, you know it's rundown.  And we would either smell the smelting, the fumes from the smelting, the beer hops which I didn't like, or sometimes the wonderful scent of bread, depending on which way the wind was blowing (laughter).  So, I didn't like Buffalo at all.  And I went to Catholic school, and let's say I didn't always get along with the nuns.  And so I didn't particularly enjoy my--I didn't enjoy Buffalo.  I mean, you know, I made the best of my surroundings, and that's one reason why my mother said, "Go live with your father [John B. Cruz, Jr.]."  "Well yeah sure, Mom."
Story_ID: 532380
Speaker 1: You started school in, on the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: In Wareham [Massachusetts], okay.  What was the name of your first school?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Oh, god.  I started out in elementary school.  I think it was called--I can't remember.  As a matter of fact, I've always wanted to go back; they've done something.  The school was vacant for a while, and I wanted to go back and turn it into affordable housing.  We have done that in some of our projects; changed old schools into housing.  But, you know, one thing I can remember about that school is--I've always had a sense of humor about me, and I joke around a lot, I just do.  And I try to make humor out of, as the Buddhists say, poison out of medicine.  And I remember getting kicked out and having get sent home, because I cracked the class up.  I wasn't really a class clown.  But the teacher was asking something about what kinds of food to feed babies, or something like that, whatever it was.  And she called on me, and I stood up and I said, "Chicken bones."  And the class died.  "Out of here!"  And it's such a funny thing.  I just remember that school for being kicked out of school, and then not going home because I knew I'd get my ass kicked when they found out I got sent home from school (laughter).  So, I waited around all day to come home with the kids, and they found out anyhow.  So I still got my beating.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: But that's what I remember about the school.
Speaker 1: And in Cleveland [Ohio], do you remember the school in Cleveland?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember the school in Cleveland.  I didn't stay there that long.  And maybe it was even during the summertime.  I didn't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so you may not have--
Speaker 2: I didn't really go to--we didn't stay that long.
Speaker 1: Now what about Buffalo [New York]?
Speaker 2: In Buffalo, I remember the schools.  Again, I went to Catholic schools.  The nuns were very discipline orientated, and I had that humorous side of me, so we were always clashing.  And I was always asking questions about religion that I wasn't supposed to be asking, or that people had--I remember, again, getting my butt in trouble there.  Because we were talking about purgatory.  And if you're Catholic, you'll know what purgatory is.  And I commented that I thought, how could God be so mean as to send a child into purgatory?  Rap on the knuckles (laughter), I remember that.  Well, I guess I better keep my mouth shut here.  So--
Speaker 1: Well, it sounds like a good question.  But not for them, I guess?
Speaker 2: Not for somebody that didn't have an answer.  Well, why would you pick on a baby?  That was--so, anyhow, I was an altar boy, but a reluctant one, let's put it that way.
Story_ID: 532381
Speaker 1: Your mother [Madeline Martin Allen] married a guy in Buffalo [New York], right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right.  And so, one of the questions I think would be interesting is how did--we were talking about the difference between Buffalo and Cape Cod [Massachusetts].  And we talked a lot during the break about some of the differences in scenery, and pollution, and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --water and stuff in Buffalo, opposed to on the cape.
Speaker 2: Well, again, it was a big culture shock.  Because here I'd come from basically a Cape Verdean community where Cape Verdean in some homes is spoken more than English.  And again, the things of large families, music, all the time close knit.  And it's a country town, and beautiful beaches in that part of the country.  We used to only have to walk a quarter of a mile to maybe half a mile at the most.  And in back of the house was a beautiful pure river we used to go swimming in, and in fact swam naked in there a lot of times.  There was actually--one of my fondest memories was my [maternal] grandfather [Casimere Martin] impressing me on his--because if you live in Cape Verde you have to swim, because there's nothing but islands, well most people learn to swim.  But he could swim excellent, but he could hold his breath.  And I can remember him diving in the water, and I'd be afraid my grandfather would drown because he wouldn't come up until sometime later.  And I do the same thing now.  People marvel.  And I was just impressed with my grandfather.  I said, I'm going to do that.  I'm going to be able to dive in the water and hold my breath like my grandfather.  So it started way back then, positive or negative influence people give you.
Story_ID: 532382
Speaker 1: But when I moved to Buffalo [New York]--and again, the neighborhood that we lived in--because my mother [Madeline Martin Allen] and my stepfather were poor--was between three things.  One, it was between a mill, smelting mill.  One was the Iroquois brewery [Iroquois Brewing Company, Buffalo, New York], and the other was the Barn Bread [ph.].  So depending on which way the wind blew, you may smell smelting from the iron mill one day, or in the morning you may smell Barn Bread, and then you may smell the hops.  So, the only one I liked was the Barn Bread.  And basically it was in an area where there was a lot of industrial traffic going on, so it was a very poor area.  So, I didn't like going from green grass and trees and a farm with chickens, to this sort of concrete jungle with, like I said, the different--almost the stench of the mills.  And during recreation, my stepfather took us to the lake when we first got there.  And as a child, I sensed so something was wrong with the lake.  I mean, just the color, it didn't look right, not that you understand full pollution then.  But it was nothing, I can tell you, it was nothing that I wanted to go swimming in.  And then they took us to a lake, and I'm not knocking the lake, but it was called Como Lake [Como Lake Park, Lancaster, New York].  And the same thing, it was fresh water, but I couldn't see the bottom.  I'm saying, "I don't want to go in the water or anything if I can't see the bottom."  And it was really muddy as far as I was concerned.  And people were swimming in there, so I did go swimming.  But I ended up actually getting one of those little freshwater leeches on me.  So that said, hey, from now on, if I'm going to go swimming, I'm going to go in pools (laughter).  And so, it wasn't a place that I relished living in.  You know, you had friends, you developed friends, because all kids develop friends.  But the environment in Buffalo, I didn't like.  And then the other thing was the amount of snow.  You had snow from before Thanksgiving until after Easter.  I remember Easter, why dress up?  People used to get clothes, but usually you still had snow on the ground in Buffalo, or many times have snow on the ground.  So it wasn't a consumer friendly, or kid friendly place to me.
Speaker 2: Now, in Buffalo, I guess you encountered like a black American community--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --that was different from the black Cape Verdeans (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, that was another thing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Again, you just--who was a Cape Verdean?  If I just said I was a Cape Verdean, people thought that was a disease, they didn't know.  "Cape Verdean, what the hell is a Cape Verdean?"  And you know, as we have it in the community there's this thing, light skin and dark skin.  And I was subject, when I moved to Buffalo, of a lot of taunting and abuse, just like, because I was very light and had--as we called it then straight hair.  So, I had to learn how to fight very quickly when I went to Buffalo, very quickly.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, now how was it in school?  How did you (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I went to a Catholic school.  Again, I didn't like the strict disciplinarian part of, kind of, control by the nuns.  And I was an altar boy, but I really didn't--I had my skirmishes with the nuns because of the politics, because I've always tended to speak my mind maybe more than some people think I should.  So, I'm still that way today.  And I used to spend a little time getting either my knuckles rapped or the--they used to have a red hand switch, that you'd have to put your hand out.  And depending on the severity of what you did, you would get your hands whacked.
Story_ID: 532383
Speaker 1: I talked to one other person from Cape Verdes [Cape Verde], you know, in this project.  And she talked about, she founded an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]--[HistoryMaker] Eugenia Fortes--in Hyannis [Massachusetts].  And she was talking about the difficulty that Cape Verdeans had in terms of identity in this country.  Are you African American when you come over here?  Or are you separate?  Or what are you?  Did you, did you experience (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --an identity crisis?
Speaker 2: I didn't for some reason experience that.  A little of it, and I have to say that on my mother's [Madeline Martin Allen] side they were much more--less cognizant of racial issues or color issues.  On my father's [John B. Cruz, Jr.] side, on the other side, they were much more aware, and there was more of the issue of "I'm Portuguese, not Cape Verdean."  They associated a lot of Cape Verdeans--back forty plus or more years ago, they used to associate themselves with being Portuguese and not--. And then somebody may say they're Cape Verdean, but you wouldn't hear anybody say, "I'm black, or African American," or anything like that.  So there was definitely this identity crisis, or unwillingness to accept the African roots by some people of Cape Verde.  And even when my mother married my stepfather, there were remarks made by my grandmother [Caroline Cruz] on my father's side to me, that your mother married a burdu [ph.] or a preth [ph.], which was a derogatory name for black.  And I got this from other people, too.  So, but when I moved to Buffalo [New York], nobody knew who a Cape Verdean was.  And I, when my mother moved--when I moved to, back with my father, before he took me in, I stayed for six months with my grandmother again.  And my mother, to be next to me, moved from Buffalo and settled in Rhode Island, which is only about sixty miles from here to be close to me.  So because my sister [Faith Cruz Cogan] never--she went to Buffalo; and that's the other thing I left out.  My sister went to Buffalo.  She left there, and I don't know whether it was six months or three months.  But she didn't stay long (laughter).  I'm not saying I blame her.  And didn't like it, couldn't get along with my stepfather, so she came back to live with my father's mother, and grew up there.  You know, it's easier for, I think it's easier--maybe it was easier for my temperament, and maybe because I was male.  But also the bond between the mother and the father, I mean mother and the son, is very, very, very close.  So I think it's harder for a son to leave their mother than it is a daughter to leave her, that's my personal view.  But there's always that bond.  And even right now between my wife [Barbara Cruz] and my son [Justin Cruz], there's a much, a bond.  And I have to admit that between my son and my wife than with me and my son, or between my daughter [Ariane Cruz], there's just this bond between mother and son that seems to be--you know, whatever it is.  So, I didn't relish leaving my mother, so I stayed and toughed it out in Buffalo.  My sister left, but when we came back here and I lived a little with my mother--I mean my grandmother--my mother was in Rhode Island.  And I actually got into fights, because for the first time some of my Cape Verdean friends met my stepfather.  "Your mother married a nigger."  And I got in fights over that.  And I'm saying, "What?  You know, I'm black, you're black.  What are you talking about?"  But that was the mindset, and this goes back to, this is in the '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was definitely that, I may be whatever, but I'm not black, you know, kind of mentality.
Story_ID: 532384
Speaker 1: That's interesting.  It happens even (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And a lot of people in the Cape Verdean community--my mother [Madeline Martin Allen] could pass for white, I mean in a heartbeat.  She didn't choose to, or didn't, or whatever.  But there were members of the Cape Verdean community, some of my relatives, that passed for white.  They called themselves Portuguese because of the name rather than Cape Verdean, and didn't associate with Cape Verdeans.
Speaker 1: Now, is there tension between the Portuguese, the white Portuguese community and the Cape Verdean community in terms of who's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, yeah, there's a difference.  I mean, we're black to them.  You know, you're just, you're black or whatever.  I mean you may be Cape Verdean, but you're still black to them, and there's still the hostilities and the race, race, that's the thing I could never--wait a minute, you're in the same boat.  They're calling you nigger, too.  What do you mean?  Just because your name is Cruz or Lopes or Fortes or whatever, you know.  Look at Africa, look at Mozambique.  I don't know, I just couldn't figure it out.  But fortunately it wasn't a lot of that.  But there was that identity politics going on.  I don't believe there's any of that going on now.  If it is, it's maybe some of the old, old, people for whatever reason didn't want to give it up.  But I think most Cape Verdeans realize it's basically a group of African islands, and we were colonized by the Portuguese.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: So anyhow, that's my experience.  It was, it's actually--I always knew racism existed.  And when we lived in Buffalo [New York] there were white neighborhoods and, you know, we really kind of knew we were going to be looked at strange.  The police would come by, "What are you doing?" and that kind of stuff.  And, but it's funny.  My first real taste of racism where it got thrown in my face was from the Cape Verdean community, not the white community.  And it was a shock, I just wasn't--it was a growing up kind of, oh, gee, the world isn't quite what I thought it was.

Speaker 1: You went to school here.  Did you go to Catholic school when you came to Boston [Massachusetts], when you moved back to Boston (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I went to public school when I came to Boston.
Speaker 1: Public school, okay.  What school did you go to?
Speaker 2: The Martin--actually it was--no, when I went it was Patrick T. Campbell Junior High [Patrick T. Campbell Junior High School, Boston, Massachusetts].  Patrick T. Campbell is where I first went to school in Boston.
Speaker 1: And what neighborhood were you living in then?
Speaker 2: We lived in what is called Dorchester [Boston, Massachusetts].  It's Grove Hall [Boston, Massachusetts], G-R-O-V-E, the Grove Hall area.  My father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] was one of the--there were probably four blacks living on that street, maybe five.  It was just in the process of being gentrified just before--at the beginning of the Jewish flight out of there, it was a Jewish neighborhood.  And I guess there might have been five blacks on the street, and the rest were all mostly Jewish, a lot of Jewish.
Speaker 1: Okay, Grove Hall.  So most of your classmates were white, I guess then?
Speaker 2: No, because that was a little further down in the neighborhood (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh okay.
Speaker 2: Most of my class--that was--we had to walk about seven blocks.  We just--we didn't have to take a bus, but almost.  We were just out of the bus route, so we walked to school.  But most of my classmates were--the school at that time was probably, it was over 50 percent black.  There were whites, but it was over 50 percent black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what was your favorite subject in school?
Speaker 2: History, actually.  I loved history, I still like history.  And at that time, probably math.  History and math were my favorite, yeah.  In junior high school those were my favorite subjects.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Having moved around so much (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I liked--for some reason we used to call civics different from history.  I don't know if--did you have that in high school?  I liked civics, because to me civics was history anyhow.  So, I liked both of those.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have like difficulty in school because of all the moving around?  Or did you--how did you do?
Speaker 2: No, I liked to read, so I did pretty good.  The difficulty I had in school was actually probably from being too much--when I had that small stint in the Cape [Cape Cod, Massachusetts]--being too much of a wise guy and pissing teachers off.  I got kept back, and I think it was because of my wisecracking and my unruliness, rather than my ability.  But I did get kept back in the second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, a second grade wise guy is not so bad.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no--again--
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: And to me it's--you know, boys take a little while to mature anyhow, I always say (laughter).  So, I was--and maybe I was acting out because of my parents being--I don't know what it was, but I was acting out then.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, did you have a favorite teacher in grade school, I mean in junior high?
Speaker 2: No, not that I can think of.  I don't have any--I guess the one that stands out was the civics teacher.  And I can't remember his name, but he was very tall.  He made it interesting.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So, were you involved in sports or anything in school?
Speaker 2: Not in junior high.  In high school I became--. In junior high I used to run a little, but I never was on the track, in a track meet.  We used to--I don't know what it was, but anyhow, no, I didn't run.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't, in junior high school I didn't do any sports.
Story_ID: 532386
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up when you came back to--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up when you came back?  I know you were an altar boy (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  Actually, my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] has never been a religious person.  When I came back, I mean we were Catholic, but he wouldn't, you know, he wasn't a disciplinarian, "You got to go to church," like my grandmother [Caroline Cruz] was on his side.  If you stayed in her house, you had to get up in the morning and go to church.  My father wasn't that way, so I used to go occasionally, but I wasn't a regular attendee.  I, like I said, I had problems with Catholicism.  And on my mother's [Madeline Martin Allen] side, they were vehement against the Catholic church for some of the abuses that you're hearing about now used to take place back then.  And it just didn't get talked about, but that's why my mother's side split from the church, because of abuses like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, we just (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Young girls were being taken advantage of in this case.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, pedophilia in the Catholic church.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It was big in Boston [Massachusetts] and Chicago [Illinois] and other places.  I mean it's been in the news a lot, that's what we're talking about.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, then it just didn't get talked about or exposed.  But then again that's--and again, my grandfather [Casimere Martin] was dead set against it.  He told me about the abuses, and said, "You shouldn't be involved in the Catholic church," and it influenced me.  I'm not saying I turned against it--because then you didn't know.  But, you know, I loved my grandfather, and let's say, you know, I didn't see him lying to me about it.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, I always approached it with a little suspicion.
Story_ID: 532387
Speaker 1: Was music a big part of growing up?  Did you--
Speaker 2: No, only--not per se music, but there was always music around.  Like I said, guitar playing, piano playing on my father's [John B. Cruz, Jr.] side.  Some of my aunts and uncles played the piano.  I can remember them being basically ordered to take piano lessons (laughter).  And playing the sax, on my father's side there's that.  And on my mother's [Madeline Martin Allen] side, I had an uncle who played the sax.  So, there was music on both sides.  They played in the school bands, and things like that.  So, there was music on both sides of the family.  My, I don't want to go into it, but my father, again, has always loved music.  And for a while, my uncle, his brother, had a jazz club.  So, music's been around in the family for years.
Story_ID: 532388
Speaker 1: Now, where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: I went to high school at Boston Tech, Boston Technical High School [John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts].  When I went, it was a school that you had to take a test to get in.  There were two schools.  One was Boston Tech, and the other was Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts].  Boston Latin was the top school, still is the top high school in Boston.  You had to take a test to get in there.  I didn't particularly want to go to Latin.  I wanted to go to Tech.  It was a good school, and maybe because some of my friends were going to Tech.  But anyhow, I took the test and passed the test and went to Boston Tech.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, it's sort of a magnet school, I guess they would call it today?
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: In that sense.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what did you I guess concentrate on at Boston Tech?
Speaker 2: Basically college preparatory courses, whatever they had; I knew I was going to college.  At the time, I didn't know what I was going to do.
Story_ID: 532389
Speaker 1: One of the things that influenced me to come to Boston [Massachusetts] to live with my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.], is when I lived with my mother [Madeline Martin Allen] and my stepfather, they both had a lot of love in the house.  And I credit my stepfather for giving me--a lot of the humor I have today comes from my stepfather, not my father, because my father is not humorous at all (laughter).  I love him to death, but he doesn't joke around much.  He's sort of like--because I think their father [John B. Cruz, Sr.] was such a strict disciplinarian, I think all the guys were like, "Oh, shit, I'm going to get the switch if I don't--."  And as a matter of fact, I love my grandfather.  He gave me a lot of, kind of role model guidance, which we don't get enough of anymore.  But he must have been a terror disciplinarian.  And again, they don't talk about him that much.  Because most of my uncles on my father's side had a speech impediment, and a lot of them used to stutter.  My father used to stutter, and as he got older he grew out of it.  But he used to stutter, and I take that as my grandfather was afraid, "Oh, shit, is he going to come in and--?"  Because he was known as a person that would swing the belt, you know, if you didn't do what he said.  And a lot of people back in that time, it was--the rod ruled.  And so, oh, god what was I saying about now.  It was leading into a segment to go into something about my father and my uncle.  I can't remember it now, so it's gone.  But anyhow, they were, they all had a slight speech impediment--
Story_ID: 532390
Speaker 1: We were talking about school (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We were talking about high school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], yeah, high school, and--
Speaker 1: High school.
Speaker 2: --what you concentrated on in high school.  And you said you knew you were going to college.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew I was going to college--
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Again, so I just took whatever courses in preparing myself.  I didn't, at that particular time when I first got into high school, I didn't really have an idea of going into business with my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] at that time.  I liked to read.  I still--at that time I really didn't know what I was doing.  And then my father, when I came up--again, I was about eleven.  And whatever it was that came up--when I was about twelve years old, he introduced me to work, both--I used to go out--I have to tell you this story.  I used to go out on Saturdays, and he would let me get out there with a hammer.  And I would just make stuff, sculptures, boats, whatever I--you know, nailing this, and playing.  And he said, "No, no, no, you know, you can't do that.  This is what you got to do."  And it might have been--I can remember going around picking up nails the guys would drop.  Because, you know, a lot of them would get wasted, so I would go around picking up the nails that the guys may have dropped, and put them back in the bucket.  And then he would have me stack and cut a little bit of wood in smaller pieces.  And finally it grew, and then I--he'd put me on one section of the floor, so that if I messed up, it wouldn't show up bad.  You know, I learned how to hammer.  I adapt to anything quick, so I got up pretty quick.  I mean, all my uncles are carpenters.  You know, so the minute I got that, I found out my assignments moved up, it wasn't fun anymore (laughter).  I was being sort of--you know, you get kind of slow walked through it.  I said, "I don't have time to go build that little giraffe I built over there."  And so from then it was every Saturday.  And every summer he would have me go in to work [at John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts].  And at one time, during that period of my life until I got to be sixteen, I thought my father was giving me cruel and unjust punishment, and was, you know, a slave master.  Because when my friends were home watching cartoons on Saturday, I was working.  My father's half a day was he'd work--at twelve o'clock he'd let the guys go.  But he would always have something he wanted to do in preparation for Monday.  So his half a days, I'd have to stay with him, because I--. So, his half a days were like until 1:30.  He never left the job at 12:00 (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, when would they start?  When would the day start?
Speaker 1: They would start at 7:30 or 8:00 you had to be out there.  So, and then in the summertime, they would go until 5:30.  Then, you were working back then nine hours a day, which was at least in my father's business was a normal day, not an eight hour day.  And so, anyhow, I grew up in that business.  And for a while I actually grew to say, "Oh, shit, I don't know if I want to do this all my life," especially when you get out there and it's a hundred [degrees]--you know, it doesn't get that much here in New England.  But even if it's in the high eighties and you're sweating like hell on the roof and, you know, you're up there and the sun's beating down on you, you say, "Hm, is this fun?"  Or, it's so cold that the nails stick together in the winter.  Because I never remember my father quitting because it was too cold or too hot, never in my whole life.  And he may let you go and warm up by the fire, but he wasn't going to stop work because it was cold or it was hot.  And he may let you go in the shade for a few minutes, but there wasn't going to be--he didn't want you to pass out, but he was, you know, from the old school, and that's what it was with him so.
Story_ID: 532391
Speaker 1: Anyhow, grew up in school kind of not knowing what I was really going to do.  I took the college courses, and then sort of in my last year of high school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], said I got to make up my mind to do something.  And I talked to my guidance counselor and I told him--I think I told you briefly before that I was really thinking I wanted to do something with the arts.  I loved to read, so I thought of being a writer or an actor.  And he explained to me how tough it was having to be a black guy, who was our assistant football coach, how tough it was for blacks to make it in careers of art.  And more than how tough it was, he showed me some figures of what people make in that industry; I mean they were at the poverty line.  And, oh, I know what I was saying back a while ago.  Again, I was saying the experience you have as a child.  I grew up with my mother [Madeline Martin Allen] and father [John B. Cruz, Jr.], and had a lot of love.  And again, I credit my stepfather with giving me some of my humor.  But they were both alcoholics, and we were always dirt poor.  I mean, at times I had cornflakes for breakfast.  I mean, I know what spam is, because we ate a hell of a lot of it.  And always one step ahead of the bill collector, you know, and there was all this craziness of always being--not wanting to bring friends over to your house because your apartment wasn't as nice as theirs was.  It was somewhat tattered, you know.  And I made a vow when I was in Buffalo [New York].  I said, "One thing I know.  Whatever I do, I'll never be poor."  I said, "I'll never make my son or daughter have to go through what I--."  I mean, kids taunt you, you know.  That's unfortunate to have someone make fun of you, "Your couch has got holes in it," or you know, whatever kids do to you.  So, that influenced me, again, more to come with my father [to John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts].  Because you know, on his side, I saw not necessarily money, but good times, and people working with a job and all the rest of that.  And I said, "That's what I want."  You know, my stepfather could never hold a job.  And so, I saw stability and the stuff I wanted on the other side.  So, it didn't take me long.
Story_ID: 532392
Speaker 1: You were saying that the turning point in your life was at age sixteen, right?
Speaker 2: Well again, I was in school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts].  And when I turned sixteen, again, I was working for my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.], like I said, not really happy with the--what I called the work that I had to do.  And my father said, "Well, you got your license now.  You can buy a car."  I said, "Buy a car?"  He said, "Yes, I've been saving the money while you've been working the past--," and I think it was three summers, because I think he started me out when I was thirteen; that was when I worked my first full summer.  He said, "I'll get you a car."  Now knowing my father, a car meant that I was going to be able to continue to work [at John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts], and I could bring some people to work now that I have my license (laughter).  But anyhow, he gave--I bought a little '54 [1954] Mercury, or '56 [1956] Mercury.  But anyhow, I bought a little Mercury, and I was the hottest thing at school, I mean, a sixteen year old kid who's got a car.  And not only in school; I mean there were a lot of adults that didn't have a car.  It was a used car, but it wasn't junk.  And I said, work does not suck.  (Laughter) Work buys you things.  So that, you know, gave me a different kind of outlook, and just right then it gave me an appreciation.  And I said, you know, my old man knew what he was doing.  Because maybe if I was getting the money, I would have spent it and wouldn't have had enough to buy that nice of a car.  Where when I was working, he didn't give me a paycheck.  He gave me money on the weekends, you know, like an allowance.  It wasn't enough.  I'm saying all this slave, this is indenture (laughter).  And my--so I won't say it changed then, but then I got an appreciation of--not that I was lazy--but I got an appreciation of, okay, there's some money here.  And after I talked to my counselor I said maybe I should stay with my father.  He actually recommended I did stay with my father.  He said, "Your father's in business.  He's got a foothold there in something.  Maybe you can expand the foothold."  So I thought about it, and I told him.  I said, "I'm not knocking it, but I don't want to be a carpenter all my life."  He said, "Well, you don't have to be.  Maybe you can build it into something else."  I told him I wanted to do real estate.  He said, "You use this as a base.  Your father does have a name, because he's out there."  Said make sense, so.
Story_ID: 532393
Speaker 1: He said, "What would you want to do?"  And whatever it was, I--he told me to look for a role model of where I wanted to be.  And that particular time, there was a big company in Boston [Massachusetts] called Perini.  It's still around now, Perini construction company [Perini Corporation; Tutor Perini Corporation]; they were a Boston-area firm that was started.  So I went and found some material--or he found it--I don't know what it was--on the Perini company, I started reading about them.  They had, you know, their newsletter and they had reporting.  And whatever it was, I found some articles on them.  And I said, yeah, this--one thing is you could see their cranes.  They had at least two major projects going in Boston, and you'd see the name Perini.  I think they were doing the Prudential Center [Boston, Massachusetts] at that time.  They were not too far from the high school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts], and you could see their crane from the window.  And I said, "Wouldn't that look good one day to see a Cruz sign with the name."  And that sort of became--and I said, "Yeah, I think that's what I'm going to do.  That's going to be--." I didn't call it a mission.  "But that's what I want to, I want to be a black company that has a Cruz crane above the Boston skyline."  And I found out they were a family company, and they were either second--I said, "Well, we're family."  I realized that they were white, but I was saying, "Hey, that's what I want to do."  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, were they Italians?
Speaker 1: They were Italian.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well--
Speaker 1: The industry in Boston was controlled by the Italians for a long while.  Well, first of all it was the Irish way back when.  And Italians were the low person on the totem pole.  Because this was, the Brahmins were first.  And then the Irish were first, and they got--and then they were on the low end of the totem pole.  And then the Italians--and I'll tell you a story about an Italian guy [Anthony Reppucci] that worked for us.  After we became, I don't want to say successful, but we were in business and we were employing people.  We had this Italian guy come to work for me, whose family used to have a big company.  He was the cousin of one of the brothers, but they were infighting.  The name was Rugo.  And there were three big Italian companies around.  One was Perini, Rugo, and there was another one, I can't think of it.  But they were sort of the three Italian--you know, big companies around.  Even though they were successful, he had to have an Irish guy buy a house in the Milton [Massachusetts] suburbs because they didn't want Italians.  So, it was that same--unfortunately with us we can't hide our color, unless we were light enough to pass.  So, but he had the Rugo name, and they didn't want Italians in the neighborhood.  So he had a guy named Walsh [ph.], who had a moving company, buy his house from them.  So, it just shows that a lot of people have gone through similar things, not to any degree that we have.  So, it shows you Boston.  Well, anyhow, his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) This is the world we live in.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  His family, even though they were successful, weren't welcome in that neighborhood.
Story_ID: 532394
Speaker 1: So I ended up, again, kind of saying that's what I want to model it off.  And I said yes, I'm going to go to--I'm going to stick it out with my father.  And I went to Wentworth Institute of Technology [Wentworth Institute; Wentworth Institute of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts] after I graduated, with the idea to come back and work for my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] and expand the company [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts] into general contracting.  Because we were subcontractors, and we only did carpentry work and did general contracting, which Perini [Perini Corporation; Tutor Perini Corporation] was, and other people were.  And the other thing that motivated me when I worked for my father all these years, all these summers, is that the lumber used to come in marked with the developer's name on it, whether it was Cochran [ph.], Dematteo [M Dematteo Construction Company], Flatley [ph.]--I don't know if it's Dematteo--but whichever one of the Italian developers we worked for.  And I made a vow to myself that in the future the pallets coming in with the lumber would be marked Cruz on them, because it would be something we were building and something we would own.  I made--I didn't know how I was going to do it, but that's the vow I made to myself.  And with that I went to Wentworth, and graduated and came back to work for my father, still as a carpenter, the lead carpenter running jobs for him.  And then slowly got him interested in expanding into general contracting, because it was his money, it wasn't mine.  Almost left, because I was getting frustrated because he wasn't always receptive.  "I'm happy doing what I'm doing.  Why do I want to go do this?  I don't know nothing about it."  "But Dad, I do."  And I finally convinced him that either I was going to follow the dream that I wanted, with or without him.  So I think he realized that I was going to leave.  And said, "Okay, fine, we'll try it."  And we started bidding jobs, and maybe weren't successful at first, but we got some and grew as a general contractor.  And then at the same time--this was in about '71 [1971], '72 [1972].
Story_ID: 532395
Speaker 1: And I had just recently got married [to Barbara Cruz] in 1970.  So I really had--you know, I wasn't a bachelor anymore, and I had to start thinking about--although I didn't have a family then--you know, making money and putting it away, and starting to save.  I knew I was getting married.  And when you do all that other stuff, your maturity changes.  And--
Speaker 2: So, where did you meet your wife?
Speaker 1: I met my wife down in Cape Cod [Massachusetts].  My father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] was successful enough to have a little cabin cruiser that we had down in Onset [Wareham, Massachusetts] that we'd keep, and we'd go down there.  And I met her during the summer when she came down to vacation with some people down there.  And she was out of Rhode Island, and actually went to school--I met her there, but the reason I met her was because she went to school with two Cape Verdean girls that were from Onset that I grew up with.  And they said, "Oh," my nickname is Brother.  "Oh, you got to meet Brother; you'll like Brother."  You know they were, they weren't relatives, but they were, we were so close.  We were over each other's house.  They were like cousins.  So, I don't know.  I'm not saying that I wouldn't take them out, but I always--they were always like relatives.  They were, we were at their family functions, and they were--we were like fourth cousins.  I mean--not really that close.  So anyhow, they introduced us and that was it.

Speaker 1: We started to do--and it wasn't the easiest transition to go--because you're asking people to risk more than just carpentry work.  And we--it wasn't easy going.  And the--
Speaker 2: Was the sales part of it hard?  I mean trying to sell yourself as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I'm sorry? You're trying to sell somebody--you're saying, "I can put up this whole house."  In other words, I can take care of everything, from the site work to the foundation, to everything.  It's going to be--not that you do the work.  Where before, we were only having to convince people, "I can put up this frame for you," or "I can do this," and you've got experience in there.  So, not everybody was, you know, willing to say, you know, "Well go out and get some experience."  Which again, I can't blame some people for that.  And we got a couple (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, what was your--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: I'm sorry to interrupt you.  But I guess you kind of, you talked about it a little bit.  But what was your first big job?
Speaker 1: The first big job that we got as a general contractor--and this was one of my important things I go back to.  It was actually for a black firm.  It was a black developer, a guy named Dennis Blackett, who is still one of my mentors today, even though he's no longer in the business.  And he was developing some affordable housing here in the community, and wanted to try to find a black contractor, because he had the empathy to try to say, "Let me find somebody."  He wasn't going to give it away, because he was a very astute guy, an MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts] graduate.  And so, he gave us our first big break.  And when I say first big break, we might have done a couple of small jobs, but this one was big.  And at the time, this is 19--this was before I married [Barbara Cruz].  This was like, well maybe around 1970.  We had to put up a bond for this job, and that was a big thing, a bond.  That meant if we didn't finish it, the surety company would come in.  And that's one of the hardest things for a contractor to get, especially black contractors, because you have to have net worth before they give you a bond.  You just can't walk in and say I got the experience.  You may have the experience, but what do you have if we have to go--?  It's like collateral for the bond.  "If we have to pull on some of your resources to finish the job, what do you have that we can pull on?"  I was fortunate enough to have a father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] that had some of that.  So we were able to get--he gave us the job.  We had to get the bond, and I can remember we had to go around to quite a few places; it didn't come easy.  We met this one guy, and this was sort of, you know, the Cape Cod [Massachusetts] connection.  It was a white guy who happened to grow up down on the cape and had an admiration, a respect for the Cape Verdean work ethic.  And said, you know, "Because I know you guys are hard workers on the cape, I'm going to give you, basically I'm going to give you a break."  Not that he did anything for us, but he did something for us when other people were resisting because we were black.  And he knew, again, basically the work ethic.  And based on that--along, again, with my father having the money, we put up a bond.  And at that time we actually posted a bank account in my father's name to the bonding company in case we defaulted, and then he gave us the bond.  The bond was for about $60, 70,000; I can't remember exactly what at this time.  And it was basically a structure that had three units in it.  And my father put the money in an account, and if we defaulted they were going to take that money.  So that really put us on the map as--instead of a black contractor--we were still a black contractor, but that we were getting a bond.  We were legitimate contractors; we were having a bond and surety.  So that's the first big step, "You can't knock me off the perch.  We're on the perch."  We established our beachhead, and then we went from there.  So we finished it, finished it on time, did a good job.
Story_ID: 532397
Speaker 1: Dennis Blackett had more buildings, and he gave us an opportunity to do some additional work for him, which we did.  We didn't do all of his work, but we did a substantial piece of his work.  And that was our real, our first--so it gave us a track record.  About the same time, we were trying to do developing ourselves.  And we developed what is called Taurus Apartments [Boston, Massachusetts], which is the one up in the corner there.  And--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, what's the name again?
Speaker 1: Taurus Apartments.
Speaker 2: Taurus, okay.
Speaker 1: I happen to be a Taurus, May 7th.  And we finished it in, we started in 1972 and finished it in '73 [1973].  And one of the things that got me in there, Dennis--we were only working for Dennis.  But I was looking at Dennis as a role model, because he was a developer, which was something I wanted to be.  I knew we were a contractor.  And his ability to do made it crystal clear to me, and very succinct to me, that I could do it as a black man.  With Perini [Perini Corporation; Tutor Perini Corporation] it was sort of--and any other white guy--it was a lot of people out there, again, not all Italian, but a lot of them were Italian.  It was like, to me, they were in a distance.  They weren't real, they were sort of a mirage.  There was, they weren't close enough to really identify with.  It was sort of looking at the land of Oz through the poppy fields, "How the hell do I get there?"  With Dennis, I could feel the connection and the closeness to it.  And from that point it made me decide that--and I might not have decided at that moment, but I realized that it gave me more confidence for whatever I could do it 'cause I saw another black man doing it.  So, to me that meant no matter--it might have formulated in my mind a year after, two years, whatever it was.  But I made a vow that as long as I'm alive and successful, that no matter how successful we were, no matter how much work we did, I would never move out of the black community.  Because I didn't want--I wanted someone to use me as a role model, and not have to go to a Perini or a white company--somebody that they could feel was just another black person that's working hard like they are.  And I think that's so important for our kids, especially now even more than it was then, when we had so many negative role models.  So hopefully some young man, some young kid says, "I want to be a Cruz," and they can see me and my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.], that we're ordinary hardworking folks out here and say, "Yes, I can," a little closer and convince, be a little more convincible to them that they can achieve and that they can attain.  So, anyhow that's--
Story_ID: 532398
Speaker 1: Once we got that beachhead, we were on our way.  And once we did our first development--in fact, the joke in the agency was that oh, we couldn't get a bond for that particular job at that time, because you needed more money than what he had.  We jumped from a seventy thousand dollars job--we did a few others, but this was almost a million dollars--nine hundred something odd total.  And we had to become creative.  And again, fortunately as it turned out, my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] had a little money in the bank.  It wasn't considerable, but he had enough.  I don't remember what the passbook was, but I believe it was ten grand [$10,000] he had put up, ten grand in the bank; I'm pretty sure I'm right about that.  But in 1970, that was a lot of money for a black person to have.  And we had this log ahead.  We had the agency ready to give us--but we needed a bond.  And I went around, and went from everything to trying to get a joint venture.  But everybody I went to with a joint venture to put some money in, they wanted to rob us; I mean, rape us, figuring you needed them.  And then I even actually went--I'll tell you the story.  This Italian--and I don't mean to be racist, but he's is an Italian builder we used to work for.  He says, "I got the guy to help you."  He sends me--this is a quick story.  He sends me to meet this friend of his who can help us.  We either could put a bond or a letter of credit up.  So we had to either get a bond, or we had to get about ninety thousand dollars.  It wasn't quite ninety; ninety was the full development.  We had to come up with like eighty thousand dollars in cash, or a bond.  So he said, "This guy can help you come up with the cash."  He sends me to meet this guy at a restaurant, and I meet him at the restaurant.  First of all, he looked like one of my pimp friends.  I mean I'm in, you know, I grew up in the ghetto, and I got good friends and bad friends.  And you know, I had some friends that were in that life for a while.  And it just was a little too slick.  And he was dressed, you know, he was dressed too streety.  But it just hit me, you know, I didn't think.  I said, "Wow, this guy looks, you know, kind of whatever."  But we go to their office which they had in the Financial District in downtown Boston [Massachusetts].  And I, we walk in, my father and I, and we meet him there.  And he takes us to a little side room, and there's ticker tape going off.  It looked like a stock thing.  Actually this was a while ago, when they had the ticker tapes and everything.  So I thought it was part of a stock company, or somebody who traded stock.  We go in the room, and all of a sudden the other guy comes in.  They introduce us to this bespectacled gentleman who looked very Jewish, I don't know if he was.  This other Italian comes in, a big brawny guy with a sharkskin suit.  And I'm going, "Oh, shit."  And he says that they would put the money in our account.  I don't remember whether it was a week or two.  But we were going to hire this guy who's going to be our accountant.  And by then, I kind of get--you know, I'm not stupid.  I kind of get the scene, what's happening here.  And I said, "Okay, sounds good.  We'll call you."  I didn't answer my phone for a month (laughter).  I was afraid to tell the guy no.  But again, it was the weirdest damn thing in the world.  It was, you know, mafia money.  And I said no, you know, I don't need that.
Story_ID: 532399
Speaker 1: So we were finally able to mortgage--again, thank god for my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.]--some of his properties, and we were able to get a little cash.  We were able to make a loan, borrow some money, and put that money in with it, and we were able to get the letter of credit.  So we built the project, so that gave us a track record as a developer and also as doing a project of almost a million dollars.  And then after that--I mean after the first one, it was not looking back.  And after that one, it would be hard for people to say we weren't qualified, 'cause we did it.  The joke that the agency was saying is they thought we would be back in for more money, that we wouldn't be able to finish it.  And we finished it on time.  And we had a change order back there, one change order for something like thirty-nine hundred dollars, some small change order.  And that established us with the agency that, "These guys are for real, they can perform."  And then slowly, you know, we started building it up after that.  And I think at that time my father was convinced that, yeah, this is the right way to go.  And not that he was trying to hold me back, but you know.  And then it felt good to establish something in your own community that you owned and controlled.  And so that's, that's, that was the beginning, and the rest of it was just hard work and luck.  But you can't have luck unless you're in the right place working hard, that's what I say.  So we just definitely started to, you know, take off.  Not that we got everything we should have, and we still don't.  But at least that established the track record that no one could knock us down.  So, we had a dual track.  We were doing construction, general contracting, for third party clients, and we were also trying to develop buildings.  And at that time, I was doing both.  I had maybe 25 percent of my time over on the development side, and the rest between construction or somewhere around there, maybe a little more.  So, the development wasn't coming along at a fast rate because I had to spend most of my time in the construction arena.  And we developed another project after that.  We developed Taurus [Taurus Apartments, Boston, Massachusetts], and we developed what we call Taurus at Fountain Hill [Boston, Massachusetts], still my ego again (laughter).  And then we developed another one called Baker Manor [Sarah Baker Manor, Boston, Massachusetts].  And after we developed Baker Manor, I hired somebody for the first time on the development side and put them there for the first time.  I was trying to save money by doing it, you know, myself in between splitting up the time working, you know, seven days a week.  But we were able to do it.  And then I ended up hiring our first one, and that's when the development started to take off a little more.  And that was my cousin, Danny [Daniel Cruz, Jr.], who's still here with us, who walked by here a little while ago.  He's vice president of the development company [Cruz Development Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts].  So he runs most of the day to day, you know, stuff there.  And I still spend most of my time on construction development and management.  And then in 1982 or '83 [1983] after we had built it up to about, between three and four hundred units, we started a management company to manage our own properties, Cruz Management [Cruz Management Company, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts].  So, we've had that for almost twenty-five years.
Story_ID: 532400
Speaker 1: So most of your business has been in the private sector.  Have you had much luck with contracts with the city and that sort of thing to do--?
Speaker 2: We've done some contracts with the city, but that's what they call Chapter 121A.  The way they bid here, you bid as a general and you have the subs bid.  And it's a pain in the butt.  Not that we won't do it.  If we get slow, you know, work is work.  But we prefer the private work if we can get it.  And we've done some government work.  We were an 8(a) [8(a) Business Development Program] contractor years and years ago, so we did some government work.  But we don't do a lot of government work right now.  We do a lot of housing--but we don't want to get labeled as housing--only because it's been accessible to us.  A lot of affordable housing gets done, and in the past we were asked to bid on a lot of these jobs.  Lately, I've been blacklisted for some reason; I don't seem to get bids.  I know a lot of it has to do with the unions.  We happen to be an open shop company [Cruz Companies Inc., Boston, Massachusetts]; we're not signatured to any union agreements.  So, I have a big fight with the unions in this town.  But I choose--if it costs me work, that's still my decision.  It's better now.  But again, until just recently the unions were still discriminating against blacks.  There's a book that was written over ten years ago, 'Workforce 2000' ['Workforce 2000: Work and Workers for the 21st Century,' William B. Johnston], that basically showed the workforce was going to have to be blacks and minorities, because the white workers were moving up into better jobs.  And you know, their construction workers sent their kids to college and they were moving up.  And so the construction industry had to open up to other ethnic groups, because that was going to be, again, the only ones they had resource to.  So it is happening now, but there still is not parity.  So, and again, I prefer to operate in the independency of being an open shop contractor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 532401
Speaker 1: What's your--the biggest job you've, you've tackled?
Speaker 2: The biggest job--and we have done some joint ventures.  The biggest job that we've done on our own has been about $17 million as a general contractor.  We've been involved in the joint venture of a job as much as, say about $56 million when we were a joint venture partner on--we've been a joint venture on our own on the development side.  The largest deal that we've put together has been that one right there in Miami [Florida].  It's, it was at that time back in 1989 a $36 million development.  It was actually our largest development we've done to date.  And it was three hundred and sixty-three units.  I'm sorry, four hundred and sixty-three units with a thirty-story high rise.  And you can't see it, but it encompasses a whole block.  There's townhouses that circle around it.  We won an award for that.  And there used to be a brother down there called Art Teele [Arthur E. Teele, Jr.], who was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: What's his name?
Speaker 2: Art Teele.  He's the one that shot himself about a year and a half ago.  Did you hear about a lawyer down in Miami that committed suicide?
Speaker 1: How do you spell his last--?
Speaker 2: Teal, T-E-A-L [sic.].  Art, Arthur Teele.
Speaker 1: Oh, Art Teele, okay.
Speaker 2: Arthur.  He used to be head of the National Business League for a little while.  But he was a fast moving--Art was another one of those guys like Paul [ph.], that, you know, he's a wheeler dealer; I don't know what he was doing.  But anyway, he got caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and unfortunately committed suicide.  But anyhow, he was the lawyer that helped us with that did some work, the legal work on that for us.  And he was probably more a politician than he was a lawyer.
Story_ID: 532402
Speaker 1: Oh you were telling us about your goal of amassing so many units.  You--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well hopefully, at one time we had sixteen hundred units.  We don't have that right now; we have about a thousand units.  But hopefully my goal is to have five thousand units.  You know, I plan on working for at least another ten years.  Who knows?  I may not work as long as my father did, until he was about eighty-six or so, but like I told you before, some of the healthiest people I know are working.  And even if I had the money, which at least as far as I'm concerned I don't have, I believe that there's more than money in what we represent.  I think we're still short of role models here.  And we represent more than John B. Cruz, Jr. and [HistoryMaker] John B. Cruz III; we represent successful black businesses.  And it's important to keep a successful black business going in the community, so people can see and say, "Yes, I can."  And I think whether I wanted that label or not, I got it.  And I think I owe something to the black community to keep it going and keep it successful more than just for myself.  And I really mean that.
Story_ID: 532403
Speaker 1: You've been part of the movement of the black contractors to, nationwide to unite, I guess, for their own benefit and protection.  Tell us about the organizations you've been a part of.
Speaker 2: My first experience, my first experience came with the Contractors Association of Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], which is--for a while--it's no longer in existence.  It was the oldest ongoing contractors association in the country.  We used to like to boast about that all the time.  But about five years ago--it's still chartered, but it's really not active.  But we were incorporated before the National Association of Minority Contractors was.  And we have a saying here that, "If you're black, whatever you're doing in Boston [Massachusetts], whether you're a businessman or a professional, you'll be doing better at it somewhere else," because of the racial climate in Boston.  And it's true, it is true.  I don't mean that to knock anybody in particular; maybe I mean it to knock the town and the state, whatever it is.  Yeah, fine, but it still is that today.  I can tell you, I'm in it.  And I know that if I had the same energy.  Because of my net worth, the other minority contractors around the country, they are able to do better with less adversities and impediments--better politics, whatever you want to call it.  They are able to do better with the same amount of energy that you would spend doing the same thing here in Boston.  And that's why a lot of professionals leave Boston.  And I'm not saying it's something that people don't know.  So, we formed--and what that did do was made bonds.  We formed the Contractors Association of Boston, and we went out and we demanded parity and fairness in the construction industry.  And we, Massachusetts, was one of the first states that actually came out with a legal set aside on work, and Boston was one of the first cities.  Other people came here and copied Boston and Massachusetts, and that's because of Contractors Association of Boston.
Speaker 1: Now when was that achievement?  When did you get the--
Speaker 2: We started the Contractors Association of Boston, it was started in I believe 1965 or '66 [1966], it was back then.  So even though Boston was adverse and had hardships, it forced something to come up good from it; like my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] started a business [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts] because of adversity.  It started a strong partnership among local people and the contractors who were trying to get into the contracting industry.  And again, it was a very active association for over twenty years.
Story_ID: 532404
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now when did you receive--have the legislative victory (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was probably back in the early '70s [1970s].  In fact, one of the significant things was what we call the Southeast Expressway.  It was a major, major, civil job, one of the largest ones at that time in Massachusetts.  It was an extension of the highway coming into Boston [Massachusetts].  And because of the language that we had put in the contractors, in the Contractors Association of Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], Perini [Perini Corporation; Tutor Perini Corporation], a Massachusetts-based home firm, was thrown out as a low bid, because they didn't have enough minority participation.  And that was a shot that was heard around the world.  And once that happened, people took it and said, "Oh, we can do the same thing."  And then other municipalities either stayed, or the city took our plan and started installing it.  And again, it lasted for ten or fifteen years until reverse discrimination came in, and then they started dismantling them.  And my political slap to that is, if you took another parity study right now, you'll find out it's gone back almost to what it was before.  Once you take the stick off, that it goes back to the good old boy, "I don't have to--," whatever it is.  But I can tell you right now, I hope that someone's taking a poll, because it's slipped tremendously, the gains that were made when the programs were in effect.  So, I was also involved with the National Association of Minority Contractors about the same time that CAB was coming into fruition, which was I think, again, about 19--late, say 1970, around the same time.  And I served on the board there for a number of years.  And both of those organizations were extremely critical in developing economic based, for not only contractors, but through us, our black workers came in.  So, you know, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Most of our help are minorities, because we're located right here in the community.  And that's true with most minority contractors.  So, when we came through the door, we brought the workers.  So it was--I don't know if anybody ever has done a story on the economic benefits that accrues at a McKissack [McKissack and McKissack], at a Smoot [Smoot Construction Company], or a Russell [H.J. Russell and Company, Atlanta, Georgia], or a Ozanne [Ozanne Construction Company, Cleveland, Ohio]--you know, there are some--. And the ones I'm naming are probably second or third generation contractors who've been around here for a while.  But their fathers that started that, you know, they overcame those challenges.  And those companies--and I'm not patting myself on the back, are responsible for tremendous--I mean, what I pay a project manager here [Cruz Companies Inc., Boston, Massachusetts] is maybe from a low of sixty thousand dollars to over one hundred thousand dollars.  So, it's good money.  And again, all but one of my project managers are persons of color, and most of our workers are.  So, and again, most of the firms that I know run similar operations like that.  So, we do a tremendous amount of bringing dollars to the community and keeping them in the community.  So, again, it's--both of those organizations I think didn't get enough credit, and still don't.  The NAMC is still active, and still don't get the credit due for bringing in the amount of dollars and keeping them in people of color's hands.
Story_ID: 532405
Speaker 1: Was there ever a time when things looked so tough that you thought you wouldn't recover?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there were times like that.  Again, my fallback is my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.].  I'm blessed with a father to be in business; blessed with him teaching me a trade.  I happen to be a damn good carpenter, and if I ever have to put on the carpenter belt, I'm healthy enough that I can go out and make a living for my family.  So that's always--not that I want to, because I've been spoiled (laughter).  But hey, I know I can do it; I'm not going to jump off any bridges.  The times were actually more recent than the past, because when you start to grow, you risk more.  And we had about four, maybe going on five years now, where we were almost put out of business because of a public client.  We were actually doing some work for someone that owed us a lot of money, and wasn't paying us.  And we had another job that was turning out to be a bad job for us also.  And that's all it takes; one job in this business is very risky.  The only businesses that go bankrupt more than construction are restaurant businesses.  So, construction is risky.  Development is risky, but not as much.  And the management is probably the less risk intensive part of any of the three businesses we have [under Cruz Companies Inc., Boston, Massachusetts].  So, again, the construction business, for a while we were teetering until we went through the whole court process.  And in fact, right now we're in litigation with someone for a sizeable amount of money.  But, you know, we're not as big as people think.  And if somebody owes you, you know, two million on one job, and a million on the other, that can put you out of business.  So we were there, as close as I ever wanted, (laughter) close as I ever want to get to business.  So, it is--you--construction is a contact sport, definitely.
Story_ID: 532406
Speaker 1: What would you consider to be I guess the biggest triumph of--what would you consider to be the biggest triumph of your business so far?
Speaker 2: Just, I think, continued success.  And I don't know, I sort of take it one job at a time.  I'd like to do bigger things than we've done, and I'll continue to try to do that.  But I guess if you're going to say one of the things that--even though it didn't work out for us economically--because Miami [Florida] didn't work out for us economically, but it was the largest job that we did.  We didn't have any white partners, and I'm not knocking it, but we didn't it, and we did it all on our own.  And it showed us and some other people that yes, a black person can put up something, develop something like that.  And so, it will be easier for me to do my next one.  I know that because of what I've learned doing that.  And so everyone has a different learning curve.  If I was going to say one, it's probably our first development, Taurus Apartments [Boston, Massachusetts], which will be forty years old.  And in about another six years we'll be through paying for the mortgage, as a matter of fact, and hopefully it'll be a good payday for us.  But if you go by that building today, it looks almost the same as it did when we built in 19--we finished it in 1973.  And it's still serving as affordable housing.  It still serves as a symbol of a black company [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts] building something of quality and preserving it, and a company that's still here.  And it says what you can do for the company.  And that's one, those were all the emotions my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] and I had.  We didn't want to build--which was in the typical low-income development--which means putting the minimum into it.  And for instance, back in '73 [1973] it was almost unheard of to put an elevator in a four story building.  In fact, the architects at the agency questioned us on, "Why don't you make it a walkup?"  Now, you can make a four story walkup, we wanted an elevator.  We had one of the first buildings designed with a recreation room and a kitchen, even though it was only thirty-eight units.  The residents have a recreation room and a little kitchen for when they have their functions.  When we did it, it was closed circuit TV, and no one had really heard of that.  And if you look at the building, we put balconies just so people can go out on a hot day and put a chair out there--all those things that you didn't see as typical features.  Because again, my father and I were leading with our hearts.  And that's another thing I say, unfortunately with a lot of black businesses we tend to lead a little too much with our heart, because of our past experiences.  And that's a fault that hasn't put me out of business, but I always seem to err to the heart side of, you know, giving someone an opportunity that we didn't have.  Like I said, I might have got ouched or got burned, but it hasn't put us out of business.  So, that's our makeup.
Story_ID: 532407
Speaker 1: Now what about mentorship of young people in the black community?  You're here in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts], and is it--are people coming here trying to get involved in the construction trade, or in contracting?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They are coming, but less, for some reason, than they were ten years ago.  And maybe part of the reason is there's a statistic; I don't know what it is, but there's less black contractors now, and less black real estate developers than there were ten or maybe fifteen years ago.  So they don't see as many of us out there, and maybe that's part of it, or it's not getting--the message isn't getting out in schools or whatever.  But yes, we do get some.  And I'm always trying to preach about the opportunities for good money that's here if you're, especially if you're in project management, and not even if you're in project management.  If you're just a carpenter and you're doing a prevailing wage job--I think carpenters' salaries are something--it's up in the forties, because we don't, you know, we're not prevailing wage.  I'm doing a prevailing wage job right now, but I don't have the exact--but it's something like forty-one dollars or forty-two dollars an hour.  I mean you work eight hours every day, and I mean that's, that's--I mean there's a lot of people that go to college that don't make that kind of money.  Yeah, you may have seasonal ins and outs, but a lot of the good carpenters, if they have a slow period, a lot of them, that's when they go on the side and do that porch that someone wants done; or at least all the good ones that I know.  It's not that getting laid off means that you don't find work.  So we don't get enough of it.  I'm always trying to give advice.  We've been especially--not especially--we've been slower the last four years I told you, because of the legal--our bonding capacity was cut down.  Because I don't have the money, the bonding company shuts me down.  I'm able to bid work on the amount of what's called retained earnings.  In other words, how much profit have I made and kept?  And my bonding is based on that.  So, if I've got someone that's owing me $2 million and it's one case, then if my bonding--and just a quick number--they may do it ten times.  So I had $2 million in the company [Cruz Companies Inc., Boston, Massachusetts], ten times that means I can bond jobs for $20 million worth of work.  But if I don't have that, that means $20 million worth of work I can't bid on.  And that's basically the formula you use.  Some people may give you ten, some people may give you fifteen, and somebody may give you twenty, I don't know.  But it depends on your retained earnings.  So if you're waiting for someone to pay you, and you're going to court, I can't count that as money in the company.  So it does hurt us to have these ebbs and tides, and your capacity to do work is limited by your bonding.

Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: That we would stop black on black crime with the kids.  And I actually, I get frustrated and saddened.  But you know when we were coming in--and I'm not a militant, but we knew who the enemy was when we were there.  Maybe I didn't agree with the Panthers [Black Panther Party] or the Mau Maus or any one of the militant groups, but they directed us in the attention of where the enemy was.  And the enemy isn't us, and these young kids are making the enemy us.  It's who puts the dope in here, it's who's destroyed the school system so you can't learn.  So it, I'm so glad that my kids are beyond that.  You know, my kids are--you know, well, one recently graduated and the other one's working on her doctorate.  But I'm so glad that I'm not bringing kids up.  So, that's the problem.  How do we get to this generation of--and again, I'm not a Republican, I don't want to sound like one.  I'm a Democrat and maybe I'm conservative, but I have Republican friends.  But welfare certainly didn't--as far as I--when I look at welfare, it didn't help the black community.  It probably didn't help any poor community, but it didn't help the black community because it only--instead of acting as a safety net, it is a net that people got caught in, and now there are some second and third generations of welfare mothers and fathers.  So it just takes you--like I said, and I firmly believe this.  The American Native [Native American] was put on a reservation because you could get away with it in that time, and that's what they did.  With blacks and poor people, welfare puts you on a mental reservation.  You are--your mind isn't thinking either out of your desire to get ahead or your fear of failing.  There's no fear of failing, because you got cheap food and you got a roof over your head.  My grandparents, or maybe yours, or whatever people tended to have then--if they didn't have the drive in their heart they had a fear, and they knew they had to do it for existence.  And once you get into the water, once you get into the competition, then you know how good you are.  If you don't get into that water, if you don't swim you'll never know how far you can swim.  And that's my knock on the welfare system.  I call it W.E.D., welfare, education, the lack of, and drugs.  That's what has happened, to me, to--the black community went to the wrong things.
Story_ID: 532409
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  If I look back on my career, I would have emphasized more on the management side of the business.  Because it's less risk oriented and less risk intensive, and it doesn't take as much capital to get into.  And it doesn't have anywhere near the risks that construction or even development has, and you can grow in it quicker.  And for the amount of time that I've spent, I might have, if I concentrated only on the five thousand units, I might have had them right now, had all my attention been on just Cruz Management [Cruz Management Company, Inc., Boston, Massachusetts].  Not that I'm, you know, lamenting that, but that was probably something that I should have concentrated more on, or put more staff and more time on, the management side; in other words, managing for third party clients.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's my only thing.  I can't--you know, the problem that most black businesses have, at least I think, is we haven't had--at least the people my age--we haven't had the ability to go work for white firms and learn their systems and learn from mistakes they made, or whatever.  We kind of get up and say, "Okay, it's time to be a general contractor."  And we may have read a book or asked some questions or whatever, and went ahead with it.  So, there were a lot of oops along the way, and a lot of getting your fingers burned.  And that's how you learn.  And again, if I--we just didn't have the experience to pull from--at one time I was really the only firm in Boston [Massachusetts] that had a major black project manager working for him.  And even now, I'm sure it's appalling at what it is, but you know it's--so I don't see--I see some of those people as going into construction, because they've already got the experience.  Not to say somebody won't come up the same way, but you would get a lot more people if more blacks were in the project management level or supervisory level that says, "Hey, I know how to do this, and I'm going to go and do it myself."  And that's what's a little disappointing to me.  I still don't see--at least in Boston, I don't know about other cities--enough there to give me real like, "Oh, yeah, there's a lot of us coming out."
Story_ID: 532410
Speaker 1: Likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, what I'd like my father's [John B. Cruz, Jr.] legacy to be was he was a hardworking everyday person that built up a company [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts] along with his son, and that he--his biggest thing, and always has been--is that he wanted to give back to people less fortunate, whether it was a job--because he struggled so hard to keep a job, or whether it was trying to give somebody a nice apartment and build a building that didn't look low-income.  If you look at any of our buildings, they certainly don't look low-income, even though they may be a hundred--Miami [Florida] wasn't a hundred percent, but all of our other ones basically are a hundred percent affordable.  This was a hundred percent affordable, the building we're in right now, except for us a tenant.  So, that he was able to achieve--here's a guy that didn't finish high school and went and got his--at night, and finished and went on.  He took a little construction course at night at Franklin Institute [Franklin Institute in Boston; Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts].  But again, he wasn't especially educated or equipped.  And he went out and said, "I'm going to do it," and did it.  I believe [HistoryMaker] Herman Russell started out as a plasterer.  So, again, it's that drive to want to do it, and make some mistakes along the way and pick yourself up and get up.  And my legacy is I would like to be able to say that we were successful, and as much as being successful, we brought a lot of people along with us.  I know in my heart that people, sometime in the future some people are going to talk good about us because of the number of people of color that we've helped get a job, get an apartment, or whatever it is.  I don't know to what degree, and I'm not bragging.  But I know that, because we've done just that.  And the only thing that I have lamented right now, in spite of what people think I have, I haven't had enough money--I've always wanted to be able to have enough money, to give enough money to have something in the community named after you, whatever that is, you know.  But to do that, whether it's a hospital--you've got to give some money up.  And hopefully I'll get to that point.  That means you've made enough to be able to give back.  But we've given back every day helping people have dignity, because they have a job.  You know, at one time we've had when we were at our peak, between the three companies we had well over a hundred people employed [through Cruz Companies Inc., Boston, Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Did your mother [Madeline Martin Allen] get a chance to see you become successful at this?
Speaker 2: Somewhat.  My mother died just when I was starting.  She died I think in '72 [1972] I think.  Yeah, '72 [1972], so she saw the business take off, but not to the point that we, you know, we are right now, so.
Story_ID: 532411
Speaker 1: Tell us about your family.  Are you still married?  And do you have children (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I'm married.  I have, actually I have three children.  I had a daughter when I was in high school [Boston Technical High School; John D. O'Bryant School of Mathematics and Science, Boston, Massachusetts] at seventeen.  Fortunately, I didn't get married because we were too young to get married.  And her mother and my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] knew it, and didn't try to make us do the right thing, as to say.  But I was fortunate enough to have a close family, which spreads to me, and so I did--doing the right thing was there.  Back in those days if you had a daughter, you had to support her.  So, as a matter of fact I tell the story that I was playing football, I loved football.  I was a junior, and that next year I couldn't play football.  I had to go get a job to support the child I had.  And that was the consequence.  Nowadays, these young kids don't have those consequences, and don't have the (unclear).  So I grew up with my daughter, even though I wasn't married.  And so then I got married actually ten years or so later.  And my daughter is still close to me, my daughter Donna [ph.], she's my oldest one.  And out of marriage I had two other children.  One is Justin [Justin Cruz] who's my oldest, who actually worked for the company [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts] for almost five years and left the company three years ago.  My wife of thirty-seven years is a commercial artist.  And Barbara [Barbara Cruz] worked as a commercial artist until we--I think she was pregnant with our second child [Ariane Cruz].  Anyhow, she always has been an artist, a damned good artist.  And both our kids have an art background.  My son, again, worked here, but always had the longing for art.  And again, jokingly, but true, he used to complain to my wife, "I don't want to be like Dad."  And this was the time I told you when we had these rough four years, ending about a year or so ago.  He said, "I don't want to be like Dad coming home like this at the end of the night from the stress."
Story_ID: 532412
Speaker 1: But yeah, tell us, go over that again. We were talking about the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You had asked me about some of my achievements, and I really didn't expect the question so I wasn't--.  So again, on construction development, it's maybe our first one.  And I haven't done, hopefully, our largest or most significant project yet, and it's yet to come.  At least I'm going to keep working on it.  But outside of it, I think it's my legacy and the work I was able to do with the Contractors Association of Boston [Boston, Massachusetts], being the president for so many years.  Like I said, I had it for a lot of years.  I didn't have it all the time, but it's a thankless job; it was a lot of time, and no one wanted it.  I was able, because having my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] in the company [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts], to take off some time and spend on behalf of the association and other contractors.  And I was willing to do that, because I've always seen the potential of what access to the construction industry can bring in, in numbers of dollars to the community and opportunities to people of color.  And again, I think the same with the national association [National Association of Minority Contractors] where I was only the president for two years, but on the board for quite a number of years, probably about twenty years on the board with that.  And I was able to contribute to the growth of that organization, which again is responsible for a lot of legislative changes, and even the local ones, that benefitted minority firms or people trying to get contracts or become contractors.  So I think at some time someone's going to find out, or realize the amount of opportunities that both of those organizations have brought to both the national and the local community.  And I think, you know, it will be--the significance will be realized.  I don't think people realize it right now, but I think that's one of the things that I'd like to be known as, is that we created a lot of opportunities for a significant amount of folks and improved their lives.
Story_ID: 532413
Speaker 1: You were telling us about your children just before we closed too, the last time (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, yeah.  So again, my son [Justin Cruz] worked here [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts], and decided that his true love was art.  And like I said, my wife's [Barbara Cruz] a damn good artist, even now.  And he did a courageous thing.  You know, the easiest thing for him was to stay here, but he wasn't happy; it wasn't his dream or his mission.  So he left here and enrolled in the San Francisco Academy of Art [Academy of Art University, San Francisco, California] and was out in California.  He graduated in June.  He doesn't have a job yet, but I'm chanting every day and praying that he gets a job, which he will, because he's got a good work ethic, he's not lazy.  But that industry is a lot different, it's such a small industry.  His specialty is computer generated art, and he's trying to get into animation and cartoons for one of the companies that do cartoons.  And that business is growing; more and more movies are coming out with animation and/or video games, either one.  So he's diligently beating on doors, and hopefully he'll have a job real soon.  And my daughter [Ariane Cruz] is out in California, and that's one reason it made it easier.  My daughter went out there to attend Stanford [Stanford University, Stanford, California].  And she went out--originally she was going to be a marine biologist.  But anyhow, she went to Stanford and had two majors.  African American studies was her major, and arts was her minor.  But like I said, both of them have an art background from my daughter, I mean from my wife.  And she graduated, and now is finishing up.  She went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California] and is finishing up her doctorate, and I say she's going to be the next Skip Gates [HistoryMaker Henry Louis "Skip" Gates, Jr.] or the next Cornel West, or somebody like that because she's in African American studies.  In fact, she was just at Northwestern University [Evanston, Illinois] last Friday night giving a talk on one of her, one of the parts of her theses, and it was very well received.  So, anyhow, both of my kids are on the West Coast, and I don't think they're going to come back.  (Laughter) San Francisco [California] is a hard place not to like.  I like it myself.  I went to school out there, and I don't know whether I would have come back, not that I'm knocking Boston [Massachusetts].  Boston is a nice city, but San Francisco is a great place.  So I get to go visit Wine Country [California] when I go out and see them.  So, that's a plus.
Story_ID: 532414
Speaker 1: Is there anything I need to, that we should talk about or I should ask you that we haven't covered then before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Not that I can think of right now.  Again, my sort of frustration, after basically forty years since graduation [from Wentworth Institute; Wentworth Institute of Technology, Boston, Massachusetts], is that it's still too damn hard because you're black.  And I thought it would have been somewhat easier.  I didn't think I'd have to tell my son [Justin Cruz] what my father [John B. Cruz, Jr.] and uncles and the older people used to tell me, that you have to be twice as good to half as much; at least that was the saying when I was coming up.  And I think if you don't tell some kids that now, you're not telling them the truth.  At least we weren't set up.  You know, "Hey, it's going to be hard out there."  At least that's what was drilled through me.  So you know, hey, it may not be fair, but that's life.  And I think some of these kids are going out here thinking--you know, because they got a good education it doesn't mean necessarily that you're not going to run into racism.  And look at the remark that was made through the Rutgers [Rutgers University, The State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick, New Jersey] team.  So, you know, it's still--.  So I guess that's some of my disappointment.  But to say that no progress has been made, you know, I can't say that.  I just think it's still--for my own issues right now, the things that I have to hurdle over that I don't think I should be hurdling over.  It's still not a level playing field.  There's still a significant disparity as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you were referring to Don Imus' remarks concerning the black women on the women's basketball team at Rutgers that was just in the national championship.  Just for those in the future who are hearing this, they won't know what we're talking about.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 532415
Speaker 1: My last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: No one on their deathbed, I don't think, is saying, "I should have made that last million or half a million," or "I should have made--," you know, "put up that--," not to say that maybe as your legacy you should have put up a building.  But I don't think it's about money, it's about treasures from the heart.  It's about maybe didn't spend enough time with somebody--your kids, your father, or whatever?  Did you tell somebody you loved them?  You didn't forgive somebody, whatever.  So I want to be known as someone that gave a lot of treasures from the heart, was successful and prosperous in wealth, but wealth wasn't money alone.  Yeah, I want money, because I'd like a home in the islands that I can leave to my kids, and they can go to the tropics or whatever, and all the other good things that you want as part of the American dream.  But my grandmother's gone, my grandfather's gone, and some of my other friends.  But the one thing that keeps them still alive is the warm memories of being on my grandfather's knee and my grandmother baking those fig squares that she wouldn't bake for anybody but me, because they were a pain in the butt to make.  So, those times.  I want to be known as someone who's--other people's ships rose with the same tide.  Yeah, I want to be successful, and we are successful to a point, and not as successful as I'd like to be, but I want to be known as someone--again, who just did the best and maximized my success to help others come along with me.  I guess that's it.
Speaker 1: All right.  Thank you very much, sir.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 532416
Speaker 1: This is my grandfather and my grandmother on my father's side.  His name is Bertise [ph.].  It was John B. Cruz, Jr., I mean Sr. [John B. Cruz, Sr.].  His nickname was Bertise.  And her name is Carrie [Caroline Cruz].  And this was taken at their house in Wareham [Massachusetts] in the Onset section, which was basically the black Cape Verdean section.  And my grandfather as you can see--and that's not for this picture; he was clean all the time.  He used to have spats.  And the other thing I remember about my grandfather, I never saw a gray hair.  He used to dye his hair (laughter).  You never saw anything.  And I've got an uncle who's the same.  He's in his eighties, and you don't see a gray hair on his head.  But again, I have a lot of fond memories of my grandfather, and that's what that is.
Speaker 2: This is my father and I receiving the SBA [Small Business Administration] Business of the Year award for the New England region back in, I believe in 1980, somewhere around in there, 1981.  And it was very significant for us because, again, it gave us a lot of positive PR [public relations] as a black owned firm [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts].  And we were actually told we missed the national one by one point.  So again, it was a very important and prestigious award.
Speaker 1: This is my father and Kevin White, the mayor of Boston [Massachusetts] then, and myself at a digital computer plant groundbreaking.  We had just finished the plant and, again, it was a lot of press about it.  And the mayor attended the ground opening, and we opened up a plant here in the black community, the first one that they opened in any minority community.  And so again it was something that we got a tremendous amount of good PR out of.
Speaker 2: This is my father at Bridgewater State College [Bridgewater State University, Bridgewater, Massachusetts] with the president of Bridgewater State College, Dana Faria [Dana Mohler-Faria].  My father had just received an honorary degree from the college for his contribution to minority businesses in his capacity as a role model, especially for Cape Verdean youth.  Dana Faria is a Cape Verdean from Wareham, the Onset section, and had admired my father and used him as a role model as he was coming up.  So he in turn gave my father an award, and we had established a scholarship in Bridgewater College in my father's name.  And we'll be giving a check for approximately seventy-five thousand dollars to help some minority youth.
Speaker 1: This is at an NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] banquet where they honored my father for his achievement as a contractor.  And that's one of the ex-mayors of the City of Boston, Ray Flynn [Raymond Flynn] and my father.  I don't know the gentleman, but he's a board member of the NAACP.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my wife [Barbara Cruz], myself, and my father in the background.  I don't know who the woman is attending, but the cardinal in the red is Cardinal Medeiros [Humberto Sousa Medeiros], one of the long term cardinals here in the Boston area, with my two children, Justin [Justin Cruz] and Ariane [Ariane Cruz].  This was at a groundbreaking for a housing development that we did for the Archdiocese [Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston].  And the humor about this story--first of all, it got us out of the minority area.  It was in Lynn [Massachusetts], so it was very significant for a black firm to leave the black area and do something for the Catholic church.  First of all this was in Lynn, but the humorous part about it is--and the job turned out very well, we finished it on time.  After the ceremony my daughter, Ariane, came up and wanted to know from her mother, "Who is the guy in the red dress?"  Because the cardinal was dressed in red (laughter).  So, anyhow, a little humor to it.
Speaker 1: This is a picture in front of, again, another milestone for the company.  You can't see it in this picture, but it was a seventeen story high rise.  It was built back in 1985, and the significant thing about this job is the amount of black contractors who were on it.  Again, it was a seventeen story high rise, and it was significant for us to get the contract.  Again, it was--I hate to say it, because it was a black elderly group that had some empathy in trying to get us a job, and we were able to get it.  That's my father on the far left.  That's Wally Diaz [ph.], who happens to be my uncle, the guy in the red hat, who was the steel director.  This is a seventeen story building.  We bought the steel, because he couldn't afford to buy the steel.  But he erected that thing himself, unheard of in Boston.  And then further right is the two guys there that did the drywall.  They couldn't do the drywall for the whole building, but we broke off five floors and gave five floors to this minority crew, and they performed very, very well.  Earl [ph.] is the guy I used to go to school with, the guy on the right.  And that's me, and next is Raoul Piers [ph.], a fellow Cape Verdean who did all the flooring; he was the flooring contractor.  And next is Mickey Everett [ph.], who did all the painting, a long time painter that we use a lot, who has since retired.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of myself.  We had this article done, again, I think it was around 1982 or something like that; it says it on there.  But I don't--it was significant for me and our firm, because it was a Globe pullout, the Sunday Globe [The Boston Globe].  And we got tremendous press and a tremendous amount of good PR.  And inside, it talks about the firm and my family.  It shows my kids and it shows our house.  And basically, it's kind of saying that the middle class blacks have arrived.  I didn't agree with the article, but it was very beneficial to us.
Story_ID: 532417
Speaker 1: This is a picture of the Carters [Rosalynn Carter and President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] at the White House [Washington, D.C.].  And they invited the participants of Black Enterprise 100 when the magazine first came out.  I don't know if it was the first or second year, but it was an early magazine.  And we were one of the participants in there, and one of the one hundred black largest firms.  And my embarrassment with this picture is--you know, I go out in the field a lot, so I don't wear a lot of expensive suits or anything because I go out there and clothes get mud on them, tar, or whatever.  And I had gone to the job, and wasn't thinking, I'm going to the White House.  I stopped off at the job, and I got down to the White House and I said, "Oh, shit."  I was the only guy down there without a blue or grey suit.  They must have said, "Who is this farm boy?"  I have to look at it and laugh all the time.  But I just wasn't thinking.  I got down there, and I almost wanted to go buy a suit.  But anyhow we did get a chance to take a picture with the Carters.
Speaker 2: This is one of my father's recent photo just before he retired, on the housing project we were doing.  Again, he's, it was like this; you would think he was a laborer.  You wouldn't know my father was the owner of the company [John B. Cruz Construction Company, Boston, Massachusetts], because he loved the field and was always in work clothes.  And I just have to say, it's a funny story.  We have a--and maybe I should show that.  We'd have Cruz CARES, and we'd take skiing during the winter to get them out of the city, the ones that are in some of the buildings we own.  And they were asking me one summer, they were out front with a friend of ours asking if we were going to do the skiing program in the winter.  And he said, "I don't know.  You have to ask Mr. Cruz [John B. Cruz, Jr.] if he's got enough money.  Why don't you ask him?"  And they pointed, he pointed to my father.  And they said, "That's not Mr. Cruz.  He's a laborer."  Because they associated Mr. Cruz with being me, because they see me coming in the office.  They see my father coming in, but they assumed he was a laborer.  So it's a cute story.
Speaker 1: Again, it's my father again, as we call him, Bertie, in the construction trailer.  I don't remember which particular job it was, but I also--I have another humorous story.  My father doesn't drink, but he's a sweet-aholic, he loves candies, especially hard candy; he loves sweets in general.  You can forget his lunch, but don't forget his dessert or he'll be angry.  And when he worked on the jobs he would always have a jar, a glass jar on top on it where he kept his candy.  And the reason why he kept it in the glass jar was 'cause the rodents couldn't get to it.  So if he brought in the regular bags, the rodents may get in the trailer.  So anywhere my father was, you'd see this glass jar with candy in it.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of Governor King [Edward J. King] in the middle.  The white guy is Governor King.  And next to him the black guy is Marvin Gilmore [Marvin E. Gilmore, Jr.], who headed up the community development corporation.  And next to him is then the head of the state's economic development, Mike Conlin [ph.].  And I'm on the right hand side.  This was at a pre grand opening of the digital plant that we talked about.
Speaker 1: This is my father at his gala that we had last October, in October of '06 [2006], where we gave him a gala to honor him, again, because he has Parkinson's.  And hopefully he'll be around with us for a few more years, but his health isn't the same.  And we did it in order to raise money to have a scholarship in his name at Bridgewater State College [Bridgewater State University, Bridgewater, Massachusetts].  The significant thing is that the money that was raised basically came from smaller individual people, a lot of Cape Verdeans who knew him and wanted to honor him throughout this whole New England region.  People as far away as Connecticut came up to this dinner, and made contributions to the scholarship in my father's name.  So, we have a very tightknit Cape Verdean community.
Speaker 2: The picture on the left is my mother, Madeline [Madeline Martin Allen], my adorable mother.  And that's me looking all wild eyed and whatever.  But again, my mother was--I tell everybody I have my mother's compassion and love and kindness.  And I was very blessed to have her and my aunts and uncles instill me with love.
Speaker 1: And that's my father again at a little jazz thing we went to.  He loves music and jazz.  And just two weeks ago we were at Symphony Hall [Boston, Massachusetts] to see Wynton Marsalis.  And we're still planning on going to, we've been going to the Montreal Jazz Festival [Festival International de Jazz de Montreal].  And hopefully this June--actually July 5th through the 8th we'll be up there again; he still loves his music.  He may move a little slower, but he still loves his music, and actually will still get up and dance.
