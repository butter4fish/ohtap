 Paustenbaugh  Carter  Today is Friday, October 17th. We   re at the Alumni Center on the OSU  campus. This is Jennifer Paustenbaugh, and I am here interviewing Kurt  Carter who is a former Pistol Pete. We are going to talk about his  experiences as a Pete   as one of many Petes at OSU. Can you  remember the first time that you saw the Pistol Pete mascot and what  your impression of it was?  Gee, probably only once I came to Oklahoma State. I can   t remember if  I   d seen it in high school. I grew up in Oklahoma City. I can   t really  remember. Pete wasn   t that visible at that point. As I   d come up here and  went to school the first two or three years, I became really intrigued with  the mascot and how visible it was and that it was based on a real person.  Those kinds of things, so I   d say probably once I got to Oklahoma State.  Okay. You said that it was cool because he was based on a real person  but is there anything other than that that stands out?  You know, it   s an interesting deal. I don   t really think that all the parts  of being Pistol Pete hit you until you do it, and probably even until after  you do it. I think as a student you see it a particular way. It   s fun. You   re  at the athletic events. You get to go to all those things, and it   s kind of  based on athletics and the presence there but in reality, there   s a lot to it.  You   re doing parades. You   re doing alumni events. You   re a  spokesperson really for the university. I don   t think until you become  Pete are you really aware of really what it   s all about.  What did you do growing up to prepare yourself for the role of being  Pistol Pete? You   ve already said pretty much that you hadn   t seen Pete  until you came here   it wasn   t a role that you aspired to.  I   d say very little actually. (Laughter) I was always active though as a  student speaker and a student leader in high school and doing plays and  5  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  being in the public eye. I was not nervous about doing that. All that  being said, I think the first time that you walk out in front of 50, 60,  70,000 people, even though you have that head on, you   re very nervous.  But I think as you interview all the Petes as you   re doing, they   re  certainly a bunch of extroverts, and so we have that in common. I don   t  know that I did anything specifically to prepare, but I think we   re just a  lot of extroverts that like to get out and have fun, ham it up a little bit.  So what made you decide to come to OSU in the first place?  My best friend from high school was here. I had started my education as  a student trainer at Central State because they gave me a full scholarship.  I went there and all my friends were having so much fun up here at  Oklahoma State that they talked me into transferring. So I actually came  up here as a sophomore and then extended to the five-year plan, and the  fifth year I was Pistol Pete.  What were some of the other activities you were involved in outside of  being Pete? You said you were Pete as a fifth year, so what did you do  prior to that?  Well when I came up here   and this is one thing that I always talk to  young people who are trying to make a decision about going to a  university   I transferred here, and so I did not end up in a fraternity. I  was an independent, yet I was able to do everything on campus that I  wanted to, and that   s something I think is unique about Oklahoma State.  We have a very strong Greek system. We   ve got very strong residence  halls   independents. You can do anything here you want to do. In my  particular case, I got involved in the Student Union Activities Board and  moved up to Vice President of Student Activities, and then I emceed  Varsity Review twice. My junior year and the year I was Pete, I was  emcee. Actually my senior year was very busy. I was Executive  Chairman of Homecoming and Pistol Pete and emcee of Varsity Review  that year. It was one of the favorite years of my life. It really was. It was  a lot of fun.  I   m sure it was. So you must be really good at balancing lots of  activities.  I think that most of us are at our best when we   re busiest. You have to  allocate time to do those kinds of things, and I do think that   s one thing I  have carried into my adult life, my professional life, that really did help  me was that frantic year of having to get everything done. So it really  helped me.  Are you aware of any other Petes that served as both Pete and Executive  6  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Chair of Homecoming in the same year? (Laughs)  No. I don   t think anyone has done that or emceed Varsity Review. Yes,  it was a lot of fun, though, and it was really fulfilling. The relationships  that you forge during that time, those are the ones you carry the rest of  your life with you.  So when did you first decide that you wanted to be Pistol Pete?  You know it was on a lark. It was not something planned. I saw the  interviews advertised in The O   Colly, and I only decided about a week  before to go try out. Keep in mind, in 1981 things were not as organized  and structured here on campus in regard to Pistol Pete as they are now. It  was run by Student Activities, and so I went up and interviewed and I  thought I had a good interview. They called me that night and said I was  the guy and I was astonished (Laughs) and very pleased, but I didn   t  really know what I had gotten myself into in terms of the time  commitment and those things. But it turned out to be one of the greatest  parts of my life.  So what was the interview process like?  Oh, at that time they asked us   it was pretty similar to now   the only  difference was that at that time the staff advisors from the Student  Affairs area or the Student Activities area would do the interviewing.  Where now, and maybe probably for the last 20 or 25 years, the former  Pistol Petes do the interviewing and we pick the Petes each year. The  interview I think is similar. You want to see how a person looks with the  head on, if you can do a rope trick, if you can do some physical things. I  think you   re also looking   and certainly what we look for now   is do  you understand the level of commitment that it takes to be Pete from a  time perspective? And everyone thinks,    Well, that would be so much  fun to do the football games and this,    but each Pete   of course we have  two a year now   and each of those young men will make almost 300  appearances each. So they   re somewhere every day, and sometimes you  want to be there and sometimes you   d rather not be there, but you have  to get in costume and you have to get your mind right, if you will, and  go to work and represent the university. So the interview is pretty much  structured the same, but just different people do it now with the Petes.  So when did they switch to the two-Pete model?  I guess that was about   I   m gonna say that was maybe 15 years ago,  because before that we would have a Pistol Pete and an alternate. In my  year, Don Giles   great young guy from here in Stillwater   was my  alternate and he became Pete the next year. In my deal, I think I did 268  7  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  appearances in 365 days and Don did probably 75 or 80. Now, it just got  so many appearances that we went with two Pistol Petes and, like I say,  they do a lot of appearances now.  So the former Petes now are the ones that choose the current Pete, so  when does that interview process occur and what would be a typical  year in terms of the number of people that try out?  The Pistol Pete tryouts occur generally in April each year, and the  athletic department, the Spirit Coordinators. Right now it   s Tracy  Wittwer, who is the Spirit Team coach. She coordinates everything, calls  the Pistol Petes, figures out who   s gonna come. And there will be  anywhere from five to eight ex-Pistol Petes. We kind of take turns being  here. Depending on the year, we may have anywhere from 20 to 35  young men try out. We   ve had some young women try out. A lot of our  selection is based on physical look, of course, because you have to have  some height to you. That   s a very large head on that costume, and if  you   re not careful   if the individual   s too short, you kind of look like a  head with feet, you look like a Smurf. So you have to be careful about  that so      I   ve never thought about that. (Laughs)  You almost have to be around six feet tall to get the proportion, but then  mostly we   re looking for commitment. If someone has an outgoing  personality, they can go to camp and learn how to be a mascot, how to  do the things people think Pete does   but we   re looking for  commitment of, do you know the year you   re in for? Do you have any  idea of the unbelievable time commitment? Not until after you are Pete,  I think, do you slide into this alumni mix of cherishing it like we all do.  So going back to something you just said about you can go to camp and  learn how to do the things that Pete does, is there some sort of training  program for the Petes?  Well they actually go to cheerleader camp with the OSU cheerleaders  each year and typically I think it   s maybe down at SMU. There   s a  mascot part to that where they learn how to be demonstrative and make  their actions big and all the different things. Several of our Petes at the  cheerleading camps have been named what   s called    All American  Mascot,    chosen as the best mascot in the country. I can   t recall them all  by name, but over the years we   ve had a number of those as well. That  was something that in 1981 would never have been considered     Okay, I was going to say     8  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  The cheerleaders didn   t even go to camp, I don   t think. As it has evolved  and matured, it just gets better and better.  So did you receive any kind of compensation for being Pete other than  the great memories?  No. We didn   t have any kind of stipend. Actually it was sometimes  tough to get our mileage covered even, and so we incurred quite a bit of  expense on our own.  So what was the Pistol Pete costume like when you were Pistol Pete?  It was very similar to now. One of the heads that we use now, I think,  was the same one I used   is one that was produced by a gentleman that  worked for Disney. The chaps were a little different because they   re  kind of tan and they were made at OSU-Okmulgee in their leather shop.  Since then   again, everything   s been cleaned up a little. They   re orange  chaps now. Everything   s a little crisper and cleaner and has a uniform  look, but basically it was the same   boots and jeans, a white shirt, black  leather vest, your chaps and the head and that was still pretty much the  outfit. It   s just a bit more refined today.  Were there any    do   s and don   ts    about being Pistol Pete?  You know, quite frankly I had very little guidance. I think that they  turned you loose and said,    Have some common sense about this and  make sure that you   re doing the right thing. Behave yourself and  conduct yourself like your mom and dad raised you,    (Laughter) was  about the extent of it. So I kind of adopted the attitude of,    Hey, until  somebody tells me to do something different, I   m gonna try to do the  best I can and be aggressive really with the program and be all the places  I can be.    But it was a lot easier on us in some regards. It   s a lot easier  on the Petes now because it   s so organized and they don   t have to worry  about different things, but it was easier on us because we didn   t have so  much direction either   and really the time commitment was not near  what they have now, even though I did 268 appearances in a year     Yeah, I was gonna say, it was still significant.     it   s still tough. These guys really work hard I know.  There was one thing I wanted to ask you about the Pistol Pete costume.  Some of the older Petes used pistols all the time and then now we see the  shotgun a lot. Were you purely a pistol guy or did you have        81 was a pistol guy. We just had the one pistol, and we had that gun in  9  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  service for a long time. It was a .357 Blackhawk Ruger, and one thing a  lot of people don   t understand is we go to great lengths to ensure safety  with those firearms because those are not pop guns. Those are real  firearms and they can hurt people. So we are very cautious and we  always instruct the Pete   they go through gun safety courses with OSU  police and we have safeguards in place. We just have to be very careful  with those and very respectful of the fact that we still get to enjoy having  those firearms as part of our mascot image.  Right, because I   m not aware of any other mascot that has a firearm as  part of their image.  I can   t think of another mascot. I know that some spirit groups use those  with shotguns and things   I think at Texas Tech and perhaps at OU and  different places   but not the mascot itself probably.  Was your experience as Pistol Pete what you thought it was going to be?  And if it wasn   t, how was it different?  Well again, I kind of took it on a lark and so I don   t know if I had a lot  of expectations. Well let me answer that two ways. I had so few  expectations, and it was beyond my wildest dreams   not only what it  was like doing it   it was a lot of fun doing it. What happened to me was  I forged relationships both on campus and off, and I still have hundreds  if not thousands of relationships intact that have helped guide my  professional career. I started off, as a matter of fact, right out of school. I  told you I had been Homecoming Executive Chairman, and so my first  job out of college was working for the Alumni Association as the  advisor for homecoming.  Oh, how perfect  (Laughs)  Yes, called the Field Director, and I worked for the OSU Foundation for  two years      What did you do at the Foundation?  Raised money for the general university fund and then I became  assistant athletic director for eight years and headed up the OSU Posse  and the fundraising and those kinds of things. So there was a natural  trilogy for me that started with Pistol Pete and then my first 10 years in  my work life I spent here at Oklahoma State. It was a great blessing to  me.  So what do you do now?  10  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  I head up the investment program for Stillwater National Bank. I live in  Edmond. Of course we   re still headquartered here.  Right.  My office is in Oklahoma City, but yeah. Again, I think my path to the  bank actually started way back in Pistol Pete probably.  Yeah. Who would have thought, right? (Laughs)  Who knew?  So what was a typical week like for you as Pete?  Well, once school started, of course everything really picks up through  the fall. A typical week was pretty easy through football season until you  got into Friday night pep rallies. All day Saturday you might go to a  reception for the College of Engineering and then go somewhere else  and do something else   do a parade, go to the game. Where it really  picks up is when the sports started overlapping and you   re at the end of  football season and basketball and wrestling has started. So you   re doing  women   s basketball or you   re doing wrestling matches and you   re doing  lots of double-headers. That was the really busy time, that overlap  season.  So do you know what year Pete started going to women   s athletic  events?  No, I don   t. I would say probably really actively about the last 10 years  because I probably only did two or three when I was Pete.  All right. I wasn   t sure if that was something that you might have started  or was something that was already in place but just not      No. Jennifer, keep in mind that 1981   that   s about the time that Title IX  came to fruition, and to the best of my recollection, I think that our  women   s programs were not even in the NCAA at the time. I think they  were the AIAW or something, and so that was when it all started.  So right about the crossover year.  That   s about the crossover time.  Interesting. Did you have difficulty balancing your two lives? It sounds  like you were living like three or four lives (Laughs) while you were  here.  11  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  I was. Probably if something suffered, it was my academics. (Laughter)  Best I recall, I may have dropped under 12 hours finally by the spring,  but     Was that a requirement to keep 12 hours?  It wasn   t at the time.  Is it now?  Absolutely, yeah. And again that   s what I say, the Petes now enjoy so  much more benefits and structure, but they have a lot more rules, too.  And they have to maintain certain GPAs. We just had to stay out of  trouble. (Laughter)  Sometimes that   s a challenge in and of itself   There were a couple of days probably, yeah.  So what was your favorite athletic event to portray Pete at?  Basketball.  Basketball? Why was that?  Well it   s up close and personal. Of course this is before the Gallagher-  Iba Arena was enlarged and renovated, so it was a cracker box. It was  6,400 people or so and     But loud. (Laughs)  It was extremely loud and of course also at that time, our basketball  program was very good and our football program was struggling.  It   s just like everything else   when you   re winning, it   s more fun. But  basketball was a lot of fun to do.  Now right at the beginning of the interview you said that one of the  things that interested you about Pete was the fact that he was based on a  real person. Realizing that Frank Eaton had been dead for a number of  years when you took on the role, was there anything that you learned  about him that informed the way that you portrayed Pete? Any  characteristics you were aware of him having?  Absolutely. I could closely identify with Frank Eaton. My family   my  mom and dad are from southeastern Oklahoma, fondly referred to in this  area as    Little Dixie.     12  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Little Dixie, yeah. Right.  They grew up very poor, agriculture. My dad actually dated my mom by  horseback in the 1950s, and so the background of Frank Eaton with the  law enforcement and the guns and the legacy, if you will. I heard those  similar kinds of stories from my family background and people down in  southeastern Oklahoma where that was really how everybody lived, you  know. You took care of your own problems and everybody got all scores  settled and those kind of things and so I connected with there. The other  thing I connected with was he died the year I was born, 1958, which, of  course, was the first year that we had Pete. Now, as you know, our Pete  in 1958, Alan Leach, just portrayed a cowboy. He didn   t have the  papier-m  ch   head. Then after that we developed papier-m  ch   and then  through the composite materials we use today for the Pistol Pete head.  But I connected very well with Frank Eaton.  So were you ever involved in any type of mascot competition?  No. Again, they would be today. Back then we would not have had the  budget to be in a mascot competition.  So at the time that you were Pete in the Big Eight Conference, did all of  the schools have mascots that appeared at the games?  They did. Some of them were kind of rinky-dink. Some of them were  pretty good.  Some of them in Stillwater?  Yeah, yeah. I mean, you had one of everything. Of course Colorado  always had Ralphie the Buffalo, the real buffalo. I don   t think they had  Chip, the little squirrel-y looking guy   no offense   well, a little bit     but I don   t think he was around. The guys down south, they still had the  little dogs pulling the wagon. I guess they may be horses, I don   t know. I  don   t know if they   re horses or     Shetland ponies or something.  So there were some really good mascots and there were some kind of  rinky-dink ones around.  How do you feel that Pete better captures the spirit of his university for  the public than other mascots do?  Again, I think you go back to how it started. First of all, that it was based  on a real person who was chosen by the students by acclimation, if you  13  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  will. They saw this guy ride in the parade and they said,    Wait a minute.  That   s who we want our university to be modeled after from a logo  standpoint or a caricature standpoint.    So the students picked him. I  think that   s very appropriate. Secondly, Pistol Pete has evolved right  along with Oklahoma State University. If you look at the sophistication  and the position that OSU had when I graduated in 1981 and look at it  now, I think you can see that we are very well by our mascot, and so  OSU keeps getting better. Pistol Pete keeps getting better.  So were you involved in any competitions at New Mexico State or the  University of Wyoming where they had a similar-looking mascot, where  you appeared or they came here and their mascot appeared?  No, they used the same caricature as we did for awhile   the window  decal, if you will, of Pistol Pete. But their mascots never were up to par.  When I was working here at Oklahoma State, I went to New Mexico  State to consult on their mascot issues and really they ended up going a  completely different way which I thought was smart. I never really had  any contact with Wyoming.  Well it is interesting how similar they ended up being, although it seems  like in looking at it as an outsider, it seems like ours is so much more  well developed and more pervasive     Well I think that   s exactly what happened. No, I think you   re exactly  right. I think that   s exactly what happened. I think it was kind of a three-way  tie there for awhile, but as OSU emerged and our Pistol Pete  became so known with OSU, I think they kind of backed off for that  reason, and I think Wyoming   s is Cowboy Joe.  Joe, right. I don   t ever remember what New Mexico State   s was. Well I  think it   s helped us, too, that we   ve been on the national stage a lot more  with our athletic program so Pistol Pete   s had a wider exposure than  those schools did. Are there any especially meaningful experiences that  you had as Pete?  Oh, geez, so many   really so many. I remember maybe the opening  football game, Sugar Ray Leonard, the famous boxer was a guest of  some people here, and he came down and I have a picture of us sparring  on the sidelines. In basketball, Coach Denny Crum and the Louisville  Cardinals had won the National Championship the year before and so  they came in as a game here in Gallagher Hall at the time. We were  down about eight or so at the half. Keep in mind this was before the  three-point line. We fought back and fought back and at the end of the  game, they had a one-point lead and we fouled them to go to the free  throw line hoping they would miss. There was like four seconds left, and  14  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  so they stepped to the line and sure enough missed both free throws.  Eddie    Half-Court    Hannon grabs the ball, launches it from just beyond  half court and hits the bucket and we knocked Louisville off by a point.  Of course the place erupted and I   m sitting and I   m looking through the  eyes of the head, right, and I thought,    Wow, that looked like it went in.     Well about that time the crowd just literally picked me up and moved me  to half court and I went,    It did go in.    (Laughter) So that was probably,  of all the athletic events, that was probably my favorite because   great  upset, great day at Gallagher.  So what is that like watching a competition through that really sort of  limited point of view?  It   s a little tough. It   s kind of like putting two holes in a fence and  backing up about 12 inches and trying to watch the world through it.  One thing that we did develop in the chin of the head was   we   ve cut a  screen now. There   s a screen cut in the bottom of it and then it   s painted  over, but that way you can actually look straight down at your legs. The  reason we did that is because small children really don   t have a sense of  space.  Right.  You know, a three-year-old will walk right up to your legs and so lots of  times there will be children all around. Well what would happen is you   d  see them and you   d think you were clear and you   d take a step and  you   d knock three three-year-olds to the ground. They   d go tumbling  down. So we cut the screen in and that, I think, saved some bumps and  bruises on our young children in Oklahoma. But that was one deal.  I always liked the work. Out from under the head, I probably worked     I   m kind of a big ham, I like to speak   and so I got to emcee the pep  rallies and also that same senior year, I spoke at 20 honors banquets for  the Alumni Association, that same senior year (Laughs) so it was a blast.  Is there anything that you   re willing to share with us, like your most  embarrassing moment?  My most embarrassing moment. Probably the only one that springs to  mind was we were playing at Nebraska in football. I want to say this was  like an October game. Well it was 75 degrees here in Stillwater when we  left and the only thing I took was a down vest to wear because I thought  it would be nice. Well we get to Lincoln and it was just colder than  expected. The night before, myself and a few of the other members of  the spirit squad had gone out and sold the program locally pretty hard,  and we weren   t feeling at our best that next morning (Laughter) and so  15  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  it   s about 20 degrees. I   m freezing. I   m not feeling so hot, and I   m just  kind of hanging in. There   s 80,000 screaming red Nebraska fans getting  ready to just beat our brains out.  I kind of slide over to the fence and pop the deal up and one of my  buddies comes up and I think it was Farmhouse Fraternity had taken  their pledge sneak and they were up at Lincoln. He said,    Hey, you want  something to drink?    I said,    Yeah, is it a coke?       Yeah,    he said it was  coke. Well I take this big drink of coke, and it was coke with some  additives and I stood there for a minute and I thought,    I   m getting ready  to throw up in front of 80,000 people.    (Laughter) And finally I steadied  myself. It was probably not my most demonstrative game as Pistol Pete,  but that would probably be it.  But you did save yourself that embarrassment?  I did save myself. I hung on, yes.  Gosh. So you mentioned that Pete has a lot of interaction with children.  What is that like? I mean, there are children that are real excited to see  you and there are children   like I remember Pistol Pete came to my  house once as a promotion for, I think, softball, and my son was so  excited to see him and my daughter was absolutely terrified. How did  you deal with situations like that?  Happens almost every day, not just with children but people react to you  emotionally different, whether that   s your own fans sometimes and  certainly the opposing fans or children. You have to keep a really even  keel and you have to remember to make very slow motions, be very  inviting. Unfortunately, Pete   s face doesn   t move so he has that very  grim, firm expression on his face all the time and for young children,  you   re right, it can be very frightening.  A lot of times, the first thing you do is you kneel down just like we  would as an adult to greet a child. Don   t be as big to them. Get smaller if  you can and just don   t press the issue. We have seen people that keep on  pushing their kids for us and they   re screaming and crying, and at some  point, I would actually stand up and turn and walk away in a crowd. You  have to have an even keel and you have to always be really respectful to  the youngsters and, like I say, make sure you don   t run over them, too.  So is that something that you look for in Petes, when you go through the  interview process, is people that you think can do a good job with that?  Well, you   re certainly looking for that kind of thing, but quite honestly,  we   re very fortunate, and have been very fortunate, about the area of the  16  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  country that we   re located in; people here have great values. They do  mostly have a lick of sense. You can tell pretty quickly in most  interviews how a person was raised, what their values are, what they can  do. The techniques can all be taught. Everybody does it differently.  There   s no right or wrong way, but it   s kind of like their commitment,  you can see. Also you have to ask people how they take criticism  because sometimes you have to say,    Hey, look       that   s tough when a  kid is that way   but mostly it   s common sense.  When you were Pete, were you ever criticized, in a public kind of way?  Not in a public way. I think the only criticism a fan ever gave me was     this was back before people were real demonstrative at basketball  games, okay, and so everybody wouldn   t jump up behind the rail and  stuff. Well, I think we were playing Colorado or somebody, and I took  the OSU flag behind the goal and was waving it so the guy would try to  miss the free throw. I had some people come down and criticize me for  that, for being a bad sport, and of course today that would be commonly  accepted. They would be right in the sweet spot, but times have changed  and I   m not sure whether I would agree or not. I mean, I think we could  hearken back to some of those times and probably be better off in some  regards, but that was probably the only criticism I ever got.  Did you feel a special sense of responsibility representing OSU to the  public?  Absolutely. I think it probably didn   t change me and my behavior, but I  was certainly always aware that, hey, I want to conduct myself in a  way   which again, I   m not sure Pete did that. I think that was probably  still all the way back to not wanting to disappoint my mom and dad I  mean, really is where it comes from. I think it certainly makes you aware  as it does, I think, with student athletes or anyone else here that   s  representing the university as a student.  What did being Pistol Pete at the time mean to you?  Fun really. I mean you   re in college, it meant fun and access. You had  access to pretty much do anything you wanted to do and have a lot of  fun doing it. I think one of the funniest episodes, I had a Jeep, so I could  just throw the back flap up and put the head in the back of the Jeep and it  was easy access, and so I drove a Jeep. We had a wonderful group of  OSU police officers. These guys were just great guys. Several went on  to be on the highway patrol and I lost track of some of them, but they  were just great guys. I didn   t have a parking pass to be on campus, but  they just let me kind of park wherever I wanted. They knew it was my  Jeep and so I   d just go because if I had to go to Home Ec or if I had to  17  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  go to Engineering, I needed to get close to the building and not be  walking all over the place, so they were really lenient.  Well one morning I had an early class at Ag Hall, and I got over there  and there weren   t any parking places. The parking place is here and then  a little grass thing came out and then parking places, so I just pulled my  Jeep up on the grass, on the median, and went to class. I   ll never  forget   the guy   s name is Coy Jenkins, great guy   came out and his  OSU police business card is on my windshield and he had written,     Kurt. I know we cut you a lot of slack, but give me a break.    (Laughter)  I wish I had kept the card. But again, they were just so good to us and  wouldn   t let you get by with too much but would certainly work with  you and try to make everything easy.  Let you know you were pushing the limit.  Absolutely, as I was.  So what does it mean to you now to     Oh, man   wow   I think you got me very emotional. My wife is from  the University of North Carolina. She   s a Tar Heel, and she loves her  Tar Heels. She   s very loyal     They all do. (Laughs)     but she told me one time, she said,    Kurt, you feel differently about  your school than I do.    I said,    What do you mean?    and she said,    Well  it just means more to you,    and   excuse me, I   m sorry. I said,    Jenny, it  changed my life.    I grew up blue collar on the south side of Oklahoma  City. I had a great childhood, great experience, went to a great high  school, Western Heights in Oklahoma City. But I came up here and I got  to do everything. You and I have talked about it, and it reshaped me.  Then, I know you   re talking today at our 50th reunion of Pistol Petes. We  had 53 of the former Petes   I think there   s 70 of us, and I think there   s  53 back this weekend     Wow. I didn   t know it   s so many. That   s great.  Yeah, and what is really meaningful is when I see these guys. Dave  Treece from 1984, he was in our wedding in Carolina 12 years ago. He  lives in Baltimore, Maryland with his wife, Marcy. His wife Marcy sang  at our wedding. I   ve seen them one time since then, and so the  relationships with the Petes, the relationships with the people here at  Oklahoma State   it   s everything   I mean, it   s the best part of life. It is.  18  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Well, sometimes I think it   s good that when we have experiences at a  young age that we don   t realize at the time how important they   re going  to be to us later on.  And I hope as we have hopefully matured (Laughter) that we continue to  be respectful of those things and to help grow the young people in those  deals and to lead them and support them and give to them those kind of  things.  You talked about the fact that Dave Treece from 1984 was in your  wedding, do you keep in close contact with the Petes other than the ones  that were immediately around the time that you were here?  Oh, some   not a lot   you know, life goes on and life comes at everyone  pretty quickly and it   s hard to keep up even with those guys sometimes.  We e-mail and we try to get together if they   re gonna come in to see  their families for Thanksgiving or Christmas or if we   re traveling out in  their areas. I have probably kept in touch with some more of them  because I tried to get the reunion organized. But I think you kind of  cluster around the three or four guys that were before and after you, and  so I think at the reunion this weekend we   ll see that manifested, too.  When you were Pete, did you ever get in touch with any of the former  Petes to find out how they handled things or     No, I didn   t get in touch with them, but they got in touch with me.  Several guys would come up and say,    Hey, I was Pete in    1973    or    I  was Pete in 1966    and again, the Alumni Club was not as well  structured. But yeah, I had great conversations with those guys and  they   d tell me funny stories and of course keep in mind again it was     loose as a goose.    I mean, you kind of made it up as you went along at  the time and so they would always come talk to me and I began to get  some friendships started with them. You   re a little intimidated as a  student though     Sure.  I mean when somebody   s five years older than you are and you   re 21  years old     That seems so young. (Laughs)     that seems like an eternity.  That   s right. So do you think that there   s any kind of a collective legacy  that the former Petes have left the university?  19  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  In what respect?  I guess anything beyond this really great tradition of having this  mascot   is there anything else that you think that you guys brought to  the university?  Hopefully that we have continued year after year   and I know it doesn   t  sound like a high bar without incident, but I hope that we brought  integrity to the mascot and I guess a serviceability to the mascot so it  doesn   t have to be on some administrator   s radar screen all the time.  There   s no concern and worry about it. Part of that goes to Dave Martin  and his wife, Toni, who have kind of been the sponsors   to Tracey  Wittwer and her husband, Dan   very value-based couples. We couldn   t  ask for any better adult supervision leadership over a bunch of college  students year after year after year. I think that if you   re really looking for  the answer to that question, I   d probably slide that over to those sponsors  who have really led the way and continued to guide with not just their  words but their actions and how they live their lives and those kinds of  things. I think that has really served our spirit groups, and especially  Pistol Pete, very well.  I asked you a few minutes ago about what does having been Pistol Pete  mean to you now, but has it influenced your life in any particular way?  In every way.  In every way?  In every way. It is part and parcel of who I am now. It is my primary  connection back to Oklahoma State, even though I was a professional  here as well. It really let me kick start my career and a trilogy of things  that happened. Every place that I have ever worked   from the  university, I left here and went to Phillips Petroleum, left there and came  to Stillwater National Bank and have been there ever since. All of those  were connections I made back starting when I was Pistol Pete and then  continuing on at Oklahoma State. So I can   t separate it anymore quite  honestly. I think it   s a theme of my life a little bit.  For people just meeting you, what is their reaction when they find out  that you were a former Pete?  It depends. Oklahoma State people are prone to hug me. (Laughter)  Others think,    Well, that   s neat.    They don   t understand the uniqueness  of our mascot here. Again, I   ll hearken back to my wife. She was  working in a dental office in Oklahoma   in Edmond. Chuck Hetrick  was a wrestler here, a wrestling family from Oklahoma State. He   s a  20  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  dentist in Edmond and when we first came back to Edmond, she would  come home and say,    What is the deal with you being Pistol Pete?    And  this is, you know, 20 years later. I   d say,    What do you mean?    She   d  say,    Well everybody that comes in, as soon as Beverly or Chuck say,     Oh, and her husband was a Pistol Pete    they hug me     (Laughter) She  said,    You know, at Carolina, nobody cares who the Ram is or at ECU,  nobody cares who Petey Pirate is.    She said,    Nobody cares. It   s no big  deal.    I said,    Well, you know, it really is kind of peculiar here that it   s  always been a big deal to be our mascot.    I said,    I don   t really know of  any other school that anybody cares who portrayed those mascots, but  for some reason it   s always been a big deal here.     I don   t know how  that got started, quite honestly, that everybody always thinks that   s a  really neat deal.  Yeah, that is interesting. What would you tell somebody that was  thinking about trying out for Pete?  I would first say, make sure that your grades are in order. Make sure that  you have really good time management habits. Number two, get ready  for a ride of your lifetime for a year in terms of activity and events, those  kinds of things. But the thing I would tell them is that you won   t  understand how important this will be to you maybe    til you   re out of  school for five or six years and then it will be even more important to  you perhaps than when you did the work and portrayed that as a student.  It   s just a long legacy now. I mean, we   re 50 years into it and I hope that  someone is watching you and I at the 100 year reunion.  That would be great.     Wow, look how weird they look     (Laughs)  The next question   I think that the answer, from everything you   ve told  me, is so obvious but   reflecting back, would you do it again?  I would. I think the question for me would be perhaps, would I do it  more than one year, and I don   t think I would. At the time when I did it  and it was over, oh, I wished I had another year   I wish I   d done this as  a junior and then got it again as a senior. We   ve had several guys do it  two years. I think maybe we   ve even had some guys do it three years,  but a lot of guys have done it two years. That was a special, magical,  great year for me and I   m glad it was one year. I would absolutely do it  again, but I probably wouldn   t do it two years.  Is there anything that you wish that I had asked you about your  experience as Pistol Pete or in this interview that I haven   t?  21  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Carter  Paustenbaugh  Oh, I probably just,    You were Pistol Pete in 1981? Gosh you don   t look  that old     (Laughter)  Gosh, and you don   t. (Laughter)  No, I can   t think of anything, but I appreciate your time.  I appreciate your willingness to sit down and talk today. I know you  have a really busy schedule this Homecoming, so this has been great.  It   s gonna be a fun weekend.  It is. It always is.  -------  -------
