 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Thursday, May 28, and  I   m interviewing Scott Roberts for the Oklahoma Native Artist Project,  sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History Research Program at Oklahoma  State University. Scott, you   re a Creek tribal citizen. I understand you have  some Choctaw heritage, too. You began doing traditional Woodland and  Mississippian style pottery in 2005, but prior to that, you had been  interested in anthropology and archaeology. You   ve won a number of  awards for your hand built, pit-fired pottery and had several museums  purchase your pots. You also make and sell other cultural items at times.  Thank you for taking the time to talk with me. Where were you born and  where did you grow up?  S. Roberts I was born in Wetumka, Oklahoma and grew up there. Wetumka means  flowing water in Creek. That   s where I did my high school and that   s where  I dig my clay is at Wetumka.  Little Thunder What did your father do for a living? Mother and father?  S. Roberts He was in the oil field business. He was an oil field pumper, is what he did. I  did some, too.  Little Thunder How about your mom?  S. Roberts Mom, she was just a homemaker.  Little Thunder Did you have siblings?  S. Roberts Got two boys. Our first little girl had spina bifida. She died at age three, but  we have the two boys.  Little Thunder I   m sorry. How about brothers or sisters going up?  5  S. Roberts Had three sisters. One of those has passed, my oldest sister.  Little Thunder What was your relationship with your grandparents on either side?  S. Roberts My grandfather   I knew my grandmother. She was blind from cataracts.  Then, my grandfather, he was a farmer. He passed before I was born, so I  never knew him. On the other side, my grandmother, that   s where I get my  Native heritage.  Little Thunder Is it the paternal or maternal side?  S. Roberts On my     Little Thunder Your dad   s side or your mom   s side?  S. Roberts It was on my dad   s side. My dad   s mother. Then, my granddad, I don   t even  like to talk about him. He was just no good. He mistreated my grandmother  real bad.  Little Thunder Your grandmother did share some stories with you and you were close to  her?  S. Roberts Oh yes, yes. She knew a lot of the Native ways in the way of making the lye  and all of these things. She was a very Christian woman.  Little Thunder Was she a speaker as well, Creek speaker?  S. Roberts Yes, she could, but she wouldn   t because she was taught not to speak the  language in her boarding school. She was really mistreated in the boarding  school. She just didn   t like to even talk about it.  Little Thunder That was down there in the same area, Wetumka area?  S. Roberts Yes, it was a mission school. We knew it as Mission Bottom School. It was  in the Wewoka Creek bottom, is where it was at, and at one time, was a  large complex. It had gardens. They raised their own food. Had a butcher  shop, had blacksmith shops. They had the hospital. Like I say, it was a large  complex.  Little Thunder Now, I don   t know if I read correctly, sometimes it   s not all accurate. Do  you have some Choctaw heritage on your Creek side as well or not?  S. Roberts Yes, it would have been on my Creek side.  Little Thunder What kinds of exposure did you have to Native art growing up?  6  S. Roberts Not much. I was always interested in it. I used to make little clay figures for  my sisters and stuff. I didn   t have anyone to teach me that they needed to be  fired. I know my grandmother knew that, but she wouldn   t share that with  me at all. They   d put water in a little glass or tea pot and it   d fall apart. Then  they   d get mad at me.  Little Thunder What? Your sisters?  S. Roberts My sisters. (Laughter) Later on, when I started my art, I used the same clay  to make my art.  Little Thunder From your family land?  S. Roberts Never let something like that beat me.  Little Thunder (Laughs) That   s great. So from the very beginning, you were drawn to three-dimensional     S. Roberts I was drawn to the clay from the very beginning when I was just a child. I  was working and messing with clay all the time.  Little Thunder Did you get any compliments or support from your family from being  interested in that?  S. Roberts No, no. Not at all. I   ve always been interested in art. I had a boss when I was  working in the oil business that wanted me to stay in the oil business. My  dad, he had got really bad injured two or three times in the oil business and  he didn   t want me doing that, so I went to Okmulgee and trained to be a  draftsman.  Little Thunder Okmulgee Tech?  S. Roberts Okmulgee Tech, then. Yes. I went through drafting and I was working at  Midland Co-Op in Cushing where Jean   s parents lived. It was a refinery and  I was a pipe draftsman. That   s when our daughter was born that had spina  bifida. We moved to Oklahoma City. To get a job and get started in a hurry,  I took up auto body technician. As soon as I got out of school, I was good  enough in it that they hired me as a teacher for a while to teach bodywork.  Little Thunder Here in Oklahoma City?  S. Roberts That was the main reason I got into that, for the art part of it, more than just  building cars. It became a good enough profession that that   s what I spent  my career as.  7  Little Thunder What about   just going back to your art experiences in elementary school,  are there any highlight memories or     S. Roberts Yeah, in the third grade, and I still have it, they had me do a complete thing  of the birth of Christ. I believe I did it in chalk. I remember that was my first  real experience. I did the wise men and Bethlehem. It went completely  across     Little Thunder Like a mural?  S. Roberts Uh-huh.  Little Thunder On paper?  S. Roberts That was the first art experience, but I   ve always enjoyed drawing and  painting like that.  Little Thunder You had access to more materials. Did you get any kind of base in middle  school or high school in art?  S. Roberts No, I had shop, woodshop. We took turns on checking out tools to the other  kids. When it became my time, I couldn   t work on my project, so I got in  there and got me a wood file. I carved out a jet airplane and got in real bad  trouble for doing that. I didn   t do any more of that. I did that in one class  with a wood rasp. Big chunk of wood.  Little Thunder Got it finished and     S. Roberts Of course, it got taken away and done away with which I wish I had it now.  Little Thunder Because that might have been a possible medium too? (Laughter) So  working in the automotive business, did you have the opportunity to do  painting and designs on the cars, or was it all repair work?  S. Roberts I first started out teaching painting on the cars. Then, when I went, actually,  to another shop I spent twenty-seven years at Bowen Oldsmobile. When I  started, you learned how to shrink metal and all this, and fix the parts instead  of replace them. That was the part that I really enjoyed and learned how to  actually work metal, like metallurgy. You had to learn how to shrink metal  and you made a fender look like the other side.  Little Thunder Oh, so you   re already doing a little bit of duplicating there in a sense?  S. Roberts Yes.  8  Little Thunder Were you doing drawing on the weekends, or when did you get into your  pottery again?  S. Roberts No, not at all. I was just hard at work making a living. Then when I got hurt,  they made me retire. That   s when I took up my art with pottery.  Little Thunder When did that happen?  S. Roberts Oh, I   m not sure. Seventy     J. Roberts Two thousand five.  S. Roberts Seventy-five.  J. Roberts Two thousand five.  S. Roberts Two thousand five.  Little Thunder This is Jean, Scott   s wife, helping us remember.  S. Roberts Yes, I can   t     Little Thunder Two thousand five. Prior to that, however, you   d been involved with some  archaeological associations?  S. Roberts Yes, I had studied anthropology and archaeology since, oh, the early    70s,  and I   ve always been interested in it.  Little Thunder How did you happen to decide to join a group?  S. Roberts I don   t know. It was something that was always interesting to me. They  would go on the digs and things like this. I really enjoyed that.  Little Thunder Did you have an important moment where you encountered a piece of a pot?  S. Roberts Yes, I still have a lot of shards that I   ve     Little Thunder You were mentioning that you have saved a lot of shards from pottery     S. Roberts Yes.  Little Thunder What was it like running across your first pot in a dig?  S. Roberts I have some right here. I   ve got lots of shards that we surface found. At the  time we were in the Anthropology Association in the early    70s, we found  9  new sites, and we registered the sites. They   re registered at the survey down  at OU  University of Oklahoma .  Little Thunder Where were you working, what areas of Oklahoma?  S. Roberts Oh, Lake Wister, Tenkiller, Buffalo River in Arkansas, and around my  hometown around Wetumka. That was the main places. I didn   t do anything  out west hardly at all. Some down on the Washita River. Now they got so  persnickety about even surface collecting, I just gave it up.  Little Thunder Sometimes Native people have had trouble getting anthropologists to  recognize that they have some cultural knowledge to bring to the process.  What was your experience being in an association like that in the    70s?  Were there certain attitudes and did those attitudes change?  S. Roberts No, not really. That mainly came later. A lot of the artifacts that we found  and all really had nothing to do with the people of today.  Little Thunder People currently in Oklahoma?  S. Roberts Older, most of it was older stuff. Like the Spiro Mounds, they   re not even  sure now that it was Caddo. The archaeologist, the state archeologist, says  now that he can prove that all the artifacts in Spiro came from Cahokia.  Little Thunder When did you start thinking,    I need to make pottery   ? Was it just because  you were no longer working?  S. Roberts Just as a hobby. Just started. I was actually more interested in sculpture. I  had some occasions to make some pieces and showed them.  Little Thunder At art shows?  S. Roberts In art shows, yeah.  Little Thunder What material     S. Roberts Started winning right off the bat. Winning awards. Then it pretty well took  over my life.  Little Thunder What material were you working in at that point?  S. Roberts Hand-dug clay.  Little Thunder    for sculpture?  S. Roberts Mostly hand-dug clay.  10  Little Thunder Okay.  S. Roberts That   s why I   ve tried commercial clays. I   ve found one right now that I  believe that I could use for sculptures. It turns out to be a white clay, which  my blue, I call it my blue clay, if you get the pure stuff, it is white. I just use  it for color. It   s a small vein down east of Thlopthlocco Church. That   s in  Okfuskee County.  Little Thunder Were you doing figurative sculpture then and what was the scale?  S. Roberts Oh, yeah. I took a course with Glen Thomas down at the art center. That was  the main thing.  Little Thunder Were they Native figures that you were doing at first?  S. Roberts The first was an animal figure. There was bust of a Native   . Then, some of  my little rug rats knocked it off and broke it before it ever got fired.  (Laughter) That   s been my experience.  Little Thunder You were also doing pit firing with your sculptures?  S. Roberts Yes.  Little Thunder Okay. Never have used an electric kiln?  S. Roberts I didn   t have a kiln then. I have a kiln now and it just has one coil working  on it. When I do repairs on pottery for people, I use that. It   ll come to a  temperature that I can   I use that so I can control the temperature better to  repair with.  Little Thunder Right. What was your goal in producing pots, pottery? Was it always to  reproduce ancient forms? Is that how it started?  S. Roberts Yeah, mainly. I just do the ancient forms and bring them more to a fine art  form is what I do. I have trouble with the traditional look because of my  body experience, auto body experience. All I knew then was slick and I  can   t work myself away from that.  Little Thunder You like the high gloss?  S. Roberts I will have some pieces at Red Earth that I   ve tried more to get them to look  more   but I highly burnish my pieces. It takes a long time to do the burnish  work that I do.  Little Thunder Did you take any pottery workshops before you started?  11  S. Roberts No. Self-taught. My research on fiber tempering, I did all of it on my own.  Then, I took, or it was a weekend workshop at Okmulgee? At the Council  House with Crystal Hannah and Victoria Vasquez, that   s when I first did  more of the Native style pottery. From there, I was self-taught.  Little Thunder Ballpark what year that you took the workshop?  S. Roberts Oh, that would have been about twelve years ago. That would be.  Little Thunder Okay, 2003.  S. Roberts I haven   t been in it really long like a lot of them.  Little Thunder Yeah, you   ve gotten a lot of attention and quickly made a name for yourself.  Where did you research your early designs?  S. Roberts Oh, mainly from books and stuff that I   ve studied, which to potters Sun  Circles and Human Hands is the Bible to most of the potters. I was a  member of the Central Archaeology Association and still am right now. I  don   t go along with a lot of what they are doing, but a lot of my designs  come from there that you don   t see in museums, or books, or anything else.  Little Thunder What are they doing that   s     S. Roberts They   re digging graves.  Little Thunder Oh     S. Roberts Yes, I   m very upset with that.  Little Thunder Yes.  S. Roberts They have found that they can go over in northeastern Arkansas, and pay  farmers to lease their land. They just mine it.  Little Thunder Oh my goodness.  S. Roberts They pay them more than what they make on a crop. You go over there in  airplane or aircraft, and it   s pot holes just everywhere.  Little Thunder Wow.  S. Roberts I really hate that. That   s very sacred and the pieces that I do are mainly  pieces that came from graves, utilitarian. You don   t hardly ever see them  hardly in shows, your sofkey pots and things like this, cooking pots. A lot of  12  cooking pots have a cone shape. They didn   t sit flat. They would actually set  them down in the ground or propped up with the rocks. Then they   d move  the coals up next to it, to get it boiling because it was a low-fired pottery.  You would start it cooking, just like you would to fire a pot. The fiber  tempering, what started me experimenting with that, it was in a Central  Archaeology  Association  magazine. It was very clear that the side of the  pot had blown out in the firing. They had made a paste and patched the paste  with it and refired it. That was the first experience that I saw of one actually  repaired.  Little Thunder Using fiber for temper. What kind of fiber?  S. Roberts I use cattail fluff. I never tried any other.  Little Thunder Okay. Do you know if that was what was present in that repair of that early  pot?  S. Roberts I feel like it had to be. What cattail fluff will do, it binds like this to the clay.  It   ll actually go in the pores, if you scratch that a little bit. Then you use that  paste and it won   t shrink like straight clay or shell-tempered, either one. It  doesn   t shrink. That can even be burnished and even after it   s burnished,  then it can be fired and it just burns that away. Most of the time, you can   t  even tell it was   .That was part of my body experience, too. When I started  doing bodywork, we made most of our tools, so I had to figure things out  like that.  Little Thunder Turned out to be the perfect background. Do you use that fiber temper in all  of your pots now?  S. Roberts No, not all of them. A real slick show pot, if I do use it, I put on a heavy slip  that   ll suck that slip right into that fiber. Then I can burnish that. You can  even burnish the fiber temper and still come out with a nice slick pot. To  me, it   s something that, definitely, I think most of them used in their clays,  even the shell-tempered. I still feel like that.  The oldest pottery found on this continent was on the Savannah River in  Georgia on Stallings Island. You could clearly see that they were using  palmetto and Spanish moss. It was a very thick pottery. The thing about the  fiber tempering, they make what they call a new fiber-tempered clay that  you can order, but it   s paper. All it is, is toilet paper.  Little Thunder How interesting.  S. Roberts But it   s a wood base, where mine   s a vegetable base and I feel like it works  better.  13  Little Thunder They   ve only recently been making that, right? The commercial clay with  paper?  S. Roberts They call it new.  Little Thunder Yeah.  S. Roberts I told the lady over at the pottery store here in town, she was telling me  about it. I said,    Well, they   re about five thousand years too late.     (Laughter) They already had that technology.  Little Thunder Good for you.  S. Roberts It was. Was about five thousand years.  Little Thunder Five thousand years old. What is an early award that you won?  S. Roberts I feel like I done some of my best work when I first started. I won some Best  of Shows in Cherokee, North Carolina, Five Civilized Tribes.  Little Thunder Now, was this with your sculpture or was this with pottery?  S. Roberts That was with pottery. It was a black drink set that had the shell cups made  into clay. Their first shell cups they made out of shell, they deteriorate. The  clay cups that they interpreted into shell, they survive. They find more shell  clay cups then they do the actual shell cups. That was the first major award.  I won Best of Show in North Carolina.  Little Thunder Was that your first time going out there as well?  S. Roberts Yes that was the first time.  Little Thunder What was that like?  S. Roberts Oh, it was good. I really enjoyed it. I won, I think, four first place s . That is  the first time I went. One of them was a monolithic axe that I carved out of  stone.  Little Thunder Wow.  S. Roberts I did some beadwork, too that won first place. I enjoy doing bead work, but  you can   t   pottery is the same way. You can   t get what you need out of  pottery, the work you put into it. When you start processing clay, if you kept  your time doing that, there is no way they   d pay what you get into it. Some  of the potters put that kind of price on them, but I don   t feel like they get  that. I feel embarrassed to even put that kind of price on them.  14  Little Thunder How did you go about pricing your work because that is tricky?  S. Roberts It   s still tricky for me. That pot behind you there. I   ve got so much time in  that. It looks very simple, but that   s one of the hardest pieces I   ve ever done.  Little Thunder What made it so hard?  S. Roberts The carving. Then I   ve done   a Dr.  J.W.    Bill     Wiggins has it   it   s the  spider that was up on top of it.  Little Thunder Yes, I saw that online. It was beautiful.  S. Roberts He had four of my pieces being showed at the Crystal Bridge s  Gallery in  Bentonville, Arkansas. It   s been probably six months or so. I think the  show   s over now. That   s my biggest awards is just people liking my work.  Little Thunder One piece that I really liked that I saw online is the turtle that comes apart,  so the shell     S. Roberts Oh, yes.  Little Thunder    which reminded me of traditional stories about the turtle before he got his  shell.  S. Roberts That represents, in fact that   s what I call it. It   s their means of getting to  Oklahoma, the Little People. (Laughter) They had a real slow journey.  Little Thunder That   s great.  S. Roberts It never did enter really good in shows.  Little Thunder Is it a piece you ended up keeping or     S. Roberts No, Eli Grayson in Tulsa, he ended up buying that. I   m really glad it went to  him, too. He really appreciates things like that.  Little Thunder Yes. How many shows do you typically do a year?  S. Roberts Oh, I don   t know. I used to do Heard Museum  Phoenix, Arizona . I won   t  go there, anymore. Santa Fe Market, I probably won   t ever go back there.  Little Thunder Is that because of the inventory you have to have?  S. Roberts It   s just such a hard trip, and yeah, the inventory. You have to supply your  own tables. They provide no security. You have to set up every morning  15  before people come in, or if you leave it at night, it   s unsecured, so you have  to pack everything up. Santa Fe, especially, it   s just not artist-friendly.  Little Thunder Hard on potters, anyway, jewelers     S. Roberts It   s really hard on potters and sculptors.  Little Thunder Other people have it easier.  S. Roberts People like this, jewelers and people that make pipes and things, it   s not so  bad.  Little Thunder Right. What   s been one of the most interesting or exciting shows you   ve  gone to?  S. Roberts Oh, probably Heard Museum and Santa Fe Market     Little Thunder The first time.  S. Roberts    and North Carolina. Catoosa  Oklahoma  is always really good. The  Cherokee  Art Market  show, I enjoy doing that.  Little Thunder Have you won an award at that show?  S. Roberts Yes, I   ve won quite a few first place awards there.  Little Thunder That   s terrific.  S. Roberts Probably the best piece that I feel like I   ve done is, there   s one in the White  House.  Little Thunder Oh, great.  S. Roberts Then     Little Thunder Along with Jerry Redcorn   s pot, you have a pot that   s in the Oval Office.  S. Roberts Museum of the Red River  Idabel, Oklahoma , they have two of my pieces.  Dr. Wiggins has some of my pieces. I have one in the Supreme Court here in  Oklahoma City. Just places like this mainly. Most of my pieces, usually, I  have some of my regular people that collect my art. There was a lady at  Maryland that just kept a running tab with me for a long time. I just let her  pay them out and I   d never met her before.  Little Thunder That   s great.  16  S. Roberts Finally met her when I was at Washington at the Smithsonian.  Little Thunder Oh, so you went up for one of the Creek Cultural Festivals?  S. Roberts Yes.  Little Thunder Do you remember what year that was?  S. Roberts No, I   m not sure. It was about three years ago, I think.  Little Thunder Okay. What was that experience like?  S. Roberts Oh, it was really good. I was kind of disappointed in the actual museum  there at the Capitol grounds.  Little Thunder Why is that?  S. Roberts The way they had it displayed and all.  Little Thunder Not a lot of things on view.  S. Roberts No, and the way they had them on view, I don   t know, I just didn   t  appreciate it very well. I   ve done Moundville,  Georgia . That was one of  my real memorable experiences is artists there, giving demos and lectures. I  was doing one on finish work.  Little Thunder On how to finish a pot?  S. Roberts How to finish a pot. We had one lady there that was, Tammy Beane, she   s  been doing restoration work for museums for a long time. She was doing  some firing. I was demoing. Jane Osti, she was demoing. Then we gave, like  I say, lectures on some of our techniques and how we finished pieces. I  really enjoyed that. Everything was just very relaxed     Little Thunder Really a great group.  S. Roberts Just really a campout as much as anything.  Little Thunder Great group of artists.  S. Roberts Yes, some of the best was there. (Laughter)  Little Thunder Have you gotten any requests to do reproduction work for museums?  S. Roberts Not from museums. Yes, the Chickasaw Cultur al  Center. They  commissioned me to do one stone piece, and then I have three pots in there.  17  If you ask to see them, they   ll say it   s all Chickasaw work. I was  commissioned to do three pots in the Mississippian style.  Little Thunder Replicate.  S. Roberts That   s     Little Thunder How much of your work is commission work?  S. Roberts Oh, I get quite a few commissions off the Internet. I just sent one. A woman  in California wanted a wedding vase (my own special design with the open  heart in the center). She wanted that for her daughter and had already bought  one off of me before. Her son saw one of my fire pots and he wanted one of  those. I built that, sent it here, lately. Then, the lady in Maryland, I   ve done  quite a few for her. Just people like that, that want a special piece. She even  had a Peruvian piece. It got broken and she wanted another one built like it.  Little Thunder Okay.  S. Roberts So I built that for her.  Little Thunder It   s a little bit different from a painter who might have somebody suggest a  subject, because you   re actually duplicating maybe a form that you   ve done  before. Do you try each time to do something different?  S. Roberts They   re always different because they   re hand built, but I had one occasion  at Heard Museum when I first went out there. A lady came by, and looked at  my work. Didn   t stay very long. Came back right at the end of the show and  wanted a certain water bottle that I had there. A lady just bought it and I was  packing it up for her. That about half made her mad. I told her I can  reproduce another one, but it won   t be just like that. I can get it close, so she  went ahead and ordered it. I think she was from North Carolina or  somewhere like that. Anyway, when I was doing it, I really did my best to  satisfy her. It came out better than the one she was wanting. (Laughter) I like  to do pieces like that and really satisfy them.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts I   ve had occasions of   some of the people I know, he bought one off of a  lady and his wife decided to wash it off after a year or so, and it melted in  her hands. (Laughs)  Little Thunder My goodness.  18  S. Roberts That   s when I started guaranteeing my pieces. I   ve learned how to even  repair pieces that people have had broken. I just tell them if I can   t fix it,  then I   ll just make you a new one. That   s how I stand behind my work.  Little Thunder That   s a pretty good deal.  S. Roberts There   s a lady in Washington, at the Smithsonian, she bought one off of me,  and her cleaning lady knocked it off and broke it. She called me and asked  me about it. I said,    Send it to me and if I can   t fix it, I   ll make another one.     She sent it and I was able to repair it. She wanted the same pot. You  couldn   t tell it   s ever been broken.  Little Thunder That   s good. How often do you end up having to repair a pot?  S. Roberts Not very often.  Little Thunder Thank goodness.  S. Roberts I   ve had to repair a couple of my communication whistles, where they wear  them around their neck, and they   ve broken a leg off or something. It   s hard  for me to guarantee those (they   re so fragile), but I still do it. I still  guarantee them. Those are the only ones. Most of them were just accidents  that people have   Dr. Wiggins had two of Victoria Vasquez   s pieces. He  had somebody break in his house. They weren   t even looking at getting his  art. They were after TVs and stuff and knocked off two of hers. They were  in bad shape, but I was able to repair those and put them back even nearly to  the same color.  Little Thunder Wow.  S. Roberts He   s another one that can vouch for me. Then, Victoria herself blew the side  out of one. When I got done with it, you could not find where it had ever  been broken.  Little Thunder That metal     S. Roberts I can do those things. I   m the only one that I know that guarantees their  pottery.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts I don   t know of anyone. I did a show in Natchitoches, Louisiana. There was  Choctaw girl there that sold a piece to a lady. She put it in a Walmart sack  and she turned around to walk away and the bottom fell out and hit the floor.     It   s yours.    That   s the way   I can   t do that. I would   ve  19  let her pick out another pot or I   d have made her another one. I just can   t do  that. That   s the way that I was raised.  Little Thunder When did you do your first effigy piece?  S. Roberts Oh, it was one of my first   I   ve done two big effigies of a kneeling female.  I gave one to the court in Okmulgee, that Supreme Court Building down  there. The judge down there, he supported me a lot, so I just gave that to  him. I made a salt pan for him, too. I gave that to him. Then, the other piece,  a lady from Missouri came down especially to buy it. She saw it on a  website. When she came in to get it, her mother was a girl that I went to  high school with, graduated from high school with. We didn   t even know  that.  Little Thunder That   s funny.  S. Roberts I have one that it   s a little man sitting with his hands crossed on his knees. I  have it packed away. I   ll probably have it at Red Earth. I   ve done two of  those.  Little Thunder How about head pots? Were they something you got into later?  S. Roberts I did. I   ve done quite a few head pots. One of them was on display at the  Crystal Bridge s  Gallery, a Dr. Wiggins piece. It was one of my better  pieces. I would call it very contemporary. It was solid red, which I call old  town red. It was really a nice piece.  Little Thunder What   s your favorite format in terms of pottery or ceramics?  S. Roberts Favorite form?  Little Thunder Yeah, favorite thing to make.  S. Roberts Probably bottles.  Little Thunder Bottles.  S. Roberts Bottles, probably, or jars like I got in there.  Little Thunder Why?  S. Roberts The bottles just have such a better form and shape to them. Then, I like to do  the highly carved     Little Thunder Right.  20  S. Roberts    which takes lots of time and you never get you price for what you put into  one, but that   s why I enjoy doing.  Little Thunder I understand that Creek Nation has asked you to do a couple of pottery  workshops in June?  S. Roberts Yes.  Little Thunder Are these the first workshops you   ve taught?  S. Roberts No, I   ve done two or three for the Chickasaws.  Little Thunder Okay.  S. Roberts I don   t know. There   ve been quite a few I   ve done. I enjoy doing those.  They just don   t give you enough time, though. I like to teach from the  ground up. Finding the clay, processing the clay, and let them really see  what   s involved in making a piece before you come to the final form. This is  the part I like to do, is really showing people that you don   t just go buy  some clay and make a piece like what I do. I know a lot of them use  commercial clay, and I don   t care. Clay is clay to me. They do put some  things in clay you buy that I don   t even like to breathe the stuff. They put  barium and things like this in it that I don   t like to use.  Little Thunder Goodness.  S. Roberts A lot of the potters, they use, I call it swamp clay where it   s been settled out  and dried out. It   ll curl up. This is runoff from fields with the herbicides, the  insecticides and stuff that   s in the clay that I don   t like to handle. I like a real  good deep clay that   s not going to have that much stuff in it, which I   m sure  that they do have some, as much as we have anymore, but I like a deep clay.  Then you know you   ve got a good clay with not a lot of foreign matter in it,  too. The settled out clay is good clay, I   m not knocking it. I just don   t like to  use it because of those things. Breathing it and everything. You   ve got a lot  of dust involved. Just rubbing an unfired pot, you   ve got dust stirring up. I  just don   t like to breathe it.  Little Thunder You   re in the process of moving your home and studio, I guess, from  Oklahoma City to Cushing?  S. Roberts Yes, it looks like I   m going to have to do that. I just can   t fire here in the  city anymore. I was firing in the backyard one day and I warned my  neighbors. I went back out there, and I couldn   t even see my neighbor   s  backyard for the smoke. I still do some back there, but it   s so hard to do in  the open and all, so I   m going to move to one of the steel sheds down there.  It   ll have an open front on it. I   ll have a sliding door over it where I can  21  secure it well, but I   m going to start trying to do all my firing down there.  The weather we have at the time you want to do it   the weather   s always so  bad that you just can   t do that. It   s just hard to do.  Little Thunder Potters, you are even more subject to the weather than     S. Roberts Yeah.  Little Thunder    a lot of other artists.  S. Roberts Even though, some of them still fire in a kiln or double fire, I don   t care.  That doesn   t bother me.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts It   s harder to do. You have lots of failures     Little Thunder And you     S. Roberts    when you   re doing pit firing.  Little Thunder Right. You did find some clay, I guess, down in Cushing?  S. Roberts Oh yes.  Little Thunder (Laughter) You want to tell us     S. Roberts I   ve found a new bed of clay on our farm in Cushing. I   ve made one little  pinch pot just to see how it worked. Always, I don   t just roll it out (a piece)  and fire it in a kiln, to see if it   s going to work or even put it in a pit. I figure  if I   m going to be messing with it, I might as well be making something with  it, but I love the color of it and everything after it   s fired. I think it   s going to  be a really good clay to work with.  Little Thunder That   s funny.  S. Roberts I just like to dig my clay from where I came from, which I will still be using  some of that. But I am going to concentrate on the farm more for my clay  and I really think it   s going to be really good. (Laughter)  Little Thunder That   s exciting. You   ve told us a little bit about your technical process, but  let   s talk about your design work. Have you created your own materials for  incising and crosshatching and     S. Roberts Yes. My design, like that piece right there, it   s a traditional design, but in a  different manner of putting it on the pot. I try to have something different on  22  my table all the time. To do reproduction work on a wheel or something     I   m not knocking a wheel   that   s an art all of its own. Those people that do  that, that just amazes me. I even took a course at the art center to do that. I  didn   t have any failures, but boy, it   s not for me. It   s nastier. You waste  more of your clay and I can   t be wasting my clay. (Laughs) When I do that  processing my own clay, I don   t like to waste any of it. I save the dust off of  it. (Laughter)  Little Thunder What about firing materials? Do you experiment with different firing  materials?  S. Roberts Yes, I was getting a real good color that looked just nearly like bronze, it  was a chocolate brown. I was using box elder leaves from my backyard. I   ve  had to take it out now. I still believe I can do it with like elm leaves or  something and not fire it as hot.  Little Thunder Neat, and     S. Roberts That   s the hardest     Little Thunder    were the leaves green or were they     S. Roberts Huh?  Little Thunder Were the leaves green or were they dried?  S. Roberts Dried. Always dried. Yeah. I   ve never used     Little Thunder I guess they won   t fire     S. Roberts I   ve never used green.  Little Thunder Okay.  S. Roberts If you use green, or like   I like to use pine bark to get my good blacks, but I  don   t like for it to touch my piece, so I take either a piece that I special make  to put over the piece and then fire it underneath the piece. It   s already in  reduction, see. This is another thing. I don   t know if anyone else does that or  not, but I just put my combustible around the pot, put the other one on top.  Then I start just a slow fire and build it up where I can build a real hot fire.  Then the piece that you built, if it cracks   I   ve wired them together and  everything until I wear them out. Mata Ortiz, I think they do a firing kind of  like that.  Even down some of the sites in the Southeast, they   ve actually found  beehive kilns on some of the sites that I   m sure they   ve probably learned  23  from the Europeans or something that they actually found. I   ve been told by  some of my elders, they would make, they called it a key hole kiln. You  would dig back in a creek bank and then hollow it out, out in the middle.  Then they would cover that with a big rock and earth. They   d have a  ventilation out the back and they   d build a fire in the opening of the kiln. I  know my Creek ancestors did that. I found that out from some of the actual  elders that remember how they did it.  Little Thunder That might be fun to try on the farm.  S. Roberts I   ve never tried it, but I do have a good place I could try it. I know you  would have to build a really hot fire to get it to do that and really fire them  good. That   s another thing. I really get my pots hot. I mean, I build a real  fire on them. That   s like down at the festival I did down at Moundville.  Tammy was out, Tammy Beane was out firing the pots while I was  demonstrating. They was out there, heaping them up and everything and  she   d come and asked me if I had a piece that I wanted to fire. I said,    Well,  yeah, I   ve got a piece here.    I had it in one of these metal cookie cans. It was  a plate. They   re usually really bad about cracking. I just told her, I said,    I  usually fire them.    I told her, I said,    Go ahead and fire everybody else   s  and have mine firing, too, but when you get through with the firing,    I said,     build a real fire on top of mine. I mean get it hot.    Little bit, here she came.  She said,    Oh Scott, I   ve heard some pinging and stuff.    She said,    I know  I   ve broken that pot.    I said,    That   s fine. I told you to do that.    I looked  over there and she had a bonfire on it. (Laughter) Anyway, when it cooled  down a little bit, I just drug it out with a stick and pulled the lid off of it and  had the most beautiful black plate you ever saw.  Little Thunder Wow.  S. Roberts It just blew their minds. But I had some newspapers there. I just wadded  them up and stuck them in there with it. I had it packed in that. I just let  them use the packing. It was   it was a beautiful black plate.  Little Thunder That   s great.  S. Roberts They couldn   t believe it.  Little Thunder (Laughs) Do you draw out your designs before you work on the pots or do  you just go to work?  S. Roberts No, I do everything after it   s dry. No one else I know does that. I do my  designs; I carve them, everything dry. Then I burnish them dry.  Little Thunder Do you have a pencil outline on the clay or not?  24  S. Roberts Some I do, yeah. I   ll figure out   I   ve made some just circles out of poster  board and mark your four points. The Creeks did everything in the four  cardinal directions. Then I sit that down and mark those spots to give me a  rough idea of where to start from. I   ll just start from there. When you   ve got  the lines close, I just guess at everything. I start     I   ll make it about a quarter of an inch from the other   and start doing the  circles.  Little Thunder How do you title your pieces?  S. Roberts Title them?  Little Thunder Do you title pieces?  S. Roberts That   s as hard to me as pricing. Yes, they   re hard to title. The one head pot,  I think Dr. Wiggins got it. It was Fallen Warrior. Then, I   ll do things that  represent the different clans and I   ll call it that.  Little Thunder We   ll look for your signature when we look at your pieces, but was that, how  did you come up with your     S. Roberts Your hand and eye     Little Thunder Okay. Is that what you use on these?  S. Roberts Yes. That   s a very universal design.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts That   s found all over the world. Like in Israel, it   s the evil eye. My rendition  of it, it   s the hand of our Father, watching over humanity.  Little Thunder What is your creative process from the time you get an idea?  S. Roberts  Un til you actually create     Little Thunder To start something? Do you keep a notebook? Do you     S. Roberts No. Mainly, I will start a piece, maybe I see in a book and then I just let the  pot build itself. It will just built itself once you start. That   s usually when I  come up with my better pieces.  Little Thunder Will you have the book close to you or is this a mental image?  S. Roberts Mostly a mental image, so it won   t be exactly like that is the way I usually  do it.  25  Little Thunder How about your creative routine? Do you work in the morning or at night  or     S. Roberts Oh, whenever I can. I get some of my best ideas when I   m trying to go to  sleep at night. I have very bad sleep apnea.  Little Thunder Do you sometimes end up working then?  S. Roberts I get up and I   ll draw out a design that I come up with. That   s how I came  up with the spider design. I had to get up, draw this out. Instead of having it  drawn on the pot, I actually did a spider on the pot. It   s a very hard process  when you make those legs, to fire that and them not shrink and not crack.  Little Thunder The proportions     S. Roberts I   ve only successfully done two.  Little Thunder Are they both spider pots?  S. Roberts Huh?  Little Thunder Were they both spiders that you did?  S. Roberts Yes, both of them.  Little Thunder Yeah, that is online     S. Roberts Then I did the one of the turtle and the little man sitting on it with the lid.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts Yeah.  Little Thunder Looking back you your career so far as a professional artist, what was one  fork in the road moment when you could have gone one way and you chose  to go another?  S. Roberts Oh, when I was actually wanting to do sculptures. That   s why I like to do an  effigy and I call my pots, sculpted pots. They   re not thrown on a wheel,  they   re handmade. I do a completely different style of coiling than anyone  else. I call it tuck and roll     Little Thunder Okay.  26  S. Roberts    where I roll up the coil down inside the pot, and as I do that, I roll it  under. I hold my coil here and I take my thumb and the clay on the side  becomes the rim. As you do that, you   re constantly wedging the clay, see.  You have no seams to deal with when you get through. Where you stack  your coils, you always have a tendency of it cracking in one of those seams.  This way, you constantly   you   re wedging that. I found out later from the  lady that does my website, she saw a thing where they were doing a version  of what I do. It was, they say, the oldest style of coiling known to man. It   s  called Asian Wedge Coiling.  Little Thunder You had just come up with this on your own, through experimentation.  S. Roberts Yes, yes. Where you come at the end of the coil, you don   t have to score  that and slip it. I just tuck another one there and keep right on coiling. When  I really want to get with one, I can throw it up nearly as fast as you can on a  wheel. It   s just things that I came up with. You can take and do a pot like  that. I show them demos. I   ll take a wire cutter and cut it in two and use two  different styles of clay, two different colors of clay. You can see where the  inside coil actually works to the outside when you are doing that. You won   t  find any bubbles in my coiling because I   m constantly wedging the clay.  Little Thunder Right. That   s really neat.  S. Roberts Then, my finishing I do it dry because I leave no burnish marks in the clay.  If you do it when it   s leather hard, you always have some of those burnish  marks in it, where I take it and I put an oil on it after it   s dry. Then I   ll just  dampen that spot. You   re just damping the surface. You   re just burnishing  the surface of the pot by doing that.  Little Thunder Wow, what   s been one of the high points of your career? You might have  mentioned it, but     S. Roberts Oh, mainly being able to sell a piece to a person that I know will really  appreciate what I   ve done. I had a young boy, he was about eighteen years  old. He came to my booth and I could tell he was serious. He wanted to  know why they were so high. I started explaining to him the process. I went  through the complete process, how I process the clay all the way up to  finishing the piece. When I got through, he looked at me and he said,     You   re too cheap.    He was really serious. He wanted to know the  technique.  Little Thunder He understood.  S. Roberts That   s my high points. Then when I had a group that was at Red Earth one  year. It was a blind group from Tulsa that came in. Most of the other people  was just scared to death, they was going to touch their pieces. When they  27  come to mine, I handed them to them. They could tell you everything about  that pot when they got through with it. They just stayed and stayed. I had to  explain the whole   my high point is teaching people about the art and the  history of the tribe. I spent 90 percent of my time, teaching people. That   s  my high points is when I can explain to them the history of our tribe. That   s  really the main thing. That   s my high point.  Little Thunder How about a low point?  S. Roberts The failures. When you work two weeks or so on a piece, and you crack it in  the firing. That was one of the main reasons I started on figuring how to  repair. Now, I won   t repair a piece and put it out for sale as a new piece. I   ll  tell them about it and if they want it then, that   s fine. I   ve had four pieces at  the Jewish Museum in Tulsa that they had a long time. I got over there and  they had already packed my stuff. I un-wrapped them this morning. They  had chipped the rim on one of them. That   s just something you have to deal  with. It   s not bad enough that    I   ll just fix that little spot and it   s good as  new. I probably won   t even add any clay to it.  Little Thunder It   ll take time. Is there anything we   ve forgotten to cover or you   d like to  add before we look at your pots?  S. Roberts No, it   s just I hate to do all the research that I   ve done and then show  someone (they just pick your brain and pick your brain) show them the  technique and they   ll get up in a demo and claim they   ve been doing that for  ten thousand years. It   s always ten thousand years. There   s some of it, if I  can   t find a Creek artist that   s interested, I   ll take it to my grave from now  on. I don   t like that, when they won   t give you the benefit of the doubt and  me the research. The experimenting and everything I did to get to that point,  especially my repair work. I don   t tell them everything.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts That was one, but they   re doing that every day. They   ll get up in their demo  and say they   ve been doing that forever. They might have, but they still  don   t have all of my secrets to it.  Little Thunder Right, right.  S. Roberts That   s one of those things I think they can try it and it   s not going to work.  Little Thunder It   d be nice to have a young Creek person who you could pass that on to.  S. Roberts It   s hard to find any in the Creek tribe that   s really interested. I don   t know  why. It   s mostly elderly people.  28  Little Thunder That come to the workshops? They   re older people that come?  S. Roberts That come to the workshops, yeah.  Little Thunder We   ve got to change that. We   ll pause for a minute and take a look at your  work.  S. Roberts Okay.  Little Thunder Okay. You want to tell us about this pot?  S. Roberts These were mainly found in Northeastern Arkansas. They were of a Quapaw  design. They   re the ones that done most of these. There has been others  found, other places, different designs, but this is from a piece that I have  seen, only I did it in a contemporary look.  Little Thunder You   re talking about the way the face is painted?  S. Roberts Yes, the way the face is changed. Most of them will have the teeth showing  here. They call it the death grin. I took that out of this one. This would have  represented tattooing on the face and you found a lot of that with the Native  tribes. They tattooed. They all nearly have this suspension hole here. A lot  of them, they   ll put up, oh, a piece of horse hair or something out of it. I  29  think it was mainly for suspension. A lot of them say that they built one of  these to represent their micco or chief, which I don   t believe that. I believe it  was to represent a trophy that they took in battle. They honored the people  that they took in battle for that purpose. They   re usually always found with a  grave. They   ll always nearly have the holes in the ears. They would have  probably put some kind of decorative thing in that. This would actually be a  shell piece that would go in the ear. A lot of them would have the shell stem  coming out the back on both sides and then it would tie in the back. They   d  put a hole through that shell and that   s how they held it in.  Little Thunder Oh, okay.  S. Roberts Then most of them had the red hair. I don   t know the significance. I   ve done  a lot of research on the black paint, and I can   t even find from archaeologists  how they got the red, blacks, and whites. They say,    Oh, it was from a resist.  I   ve tried all kinds of resists and I can   t make it work. But I have found out  that you can use   boil black locust sap and use that sap and about any kind  of a of syrup, and that   d be a post firing where you just put it up like you   re  warming it to fire it. You scorch it in like you scorch a pan. This is the only  way that I have been able to do it     Little Thunder Wow.  S. Roberts    in a post firing. If anyone knows, I   d like to know it. Colors is something  I have always been interested in too.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts Key Marco, Florida, they have the wooden deer. I   ve done one to represent  it, but I   ve used commercial colors on it. Since then, I have found how they  made their blue. It   s from a tree. It   s a mulberry, not mulberry like ours,  mulberry mixed with ground shell and the ground shell turns it blue.  Little Thunder Wow.  S. Roberts This is some of my research that other people don   t do. Their fixative, it   s  the strangler fig in Florida. They   ve researched it, they   ve analyzed it. It   s a  natural latex. It   s just like the rubber tree in South America.  Little Thunder That makes sense.  S. Roberts That   s their fixative they would use on their pieces. Most of those, when  they dug them up out of bogs, they just deteriorated immediately. They did  some beautiful, beautiful masks and things like this out of wood. Most of  our tribes had a totem at their village to represent their clan. Like it   d be a  fish, or guar clan, they would have a carved fish. The eagle was very highly  30  represented in our tribe and they would do a figure of an eagle. This is just  some of the stuff that I   ve learned from my studying the history.  Little Thunder Right. Okay, how about this piece Scott?  S. Roberts Okay, it would actually represent in our tribe, the Wind Clan. It   s your  circling of the wind in the four cardinal directions. If you   ll look on nearly  all my pots, you   ve also got the four cardinal directions. The actual deep-carved  area here for that design, I got my idea from the Southwest potters.  This would be a very contemporary version of our style. This is my own  design, in other words.  Little Thunder It   s just beautiful.  S. Roberts I will probably call it a paraphernalia pot. Something like that, that they  would keep some of their sacred stuff in, or even mix maybe the black drink  in it, something like that. I had. That   s another one, Eli  Grayson  got one  that, it was Echoes of the Past. You could actually get here and you can see  it and you can hear the echo in it.  Little Thunder Great idea.  31  S. Roberts I really like my design, but it was a very hard piece to     Little Thunder Yeah.  S. Roberts     to carve and get everything symmetrical. I like to take a piece and look  down from the top and see how symmetrical I got it.  Little Thunder Wow. Yes, yes. Amazing.  S. Roberts You can usually tell. Also, I   ll have my four cardinal directions here, right  here and in all my designs. That   s how our tribe built their sacred fire. They  would build it in a cross and they would feed the logs in from the outside.  Little Thunder I will keep my fingers crossed for you at this one at Red Earth. This is  beautiful. What can you tell us about this pot?  S. Roberts It represents a medicine bottle. This represents your medicine blossom  around here. You also have your sun circle here with your sunburst looking  down on top of it, and then you have your serpent design here.  32  Little Thunder Right. Beautiful.  S. Roberts I must have seen this on one of our brochures or something. The boy that  does the tourism, he said that was close to what their design is. I don   t know  if I   d seen it and got it in my head. It   s my own carving that I just came up  with.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts To represent the medicine blossom and all.  Little Thunder Your signature is on there? You want to show us     S. Roberts Let me see if it   s on there where you can see it. It   s on there, but it   s very  hard to see.  Little Thunder Okay. We may choose another pot to take a look at it.  S. Roberts They   re usually hard to see. It may be better on this one.  Little Thunder All right. How about this?  S. Roberts This would also represent the Wind clan     33  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts    in our tribe. This is actually a Caddoan design, but it has the same     I don   t know if they have the same meaning   but this is what ours is. It   s  your four cardinal directions, representing the wind. Even here, you got your  four cardinal directions.  Little Thunder Just a brilliant burnish on that too. Neat. Okay, we can get another.  S. Roberts What I actually do is late Woodland, early Mississippian culture. I don   t call  them Creek, Cherokee, Caddo, it   s just Mississippian culture is what I do or  Mound Builders. The Creeks were definitely very deep into the Mound  Building and at one time, was the largest tribe in the Southeast. Your  Choctaws, your Chickasaws, your Seminoles, and Creek all speak the  dialect of the Muskogean Language. The Cherokees speak the Iroquoian  dialect, a variation of it. They have their own, but it   s a variation of  Iroquoian. This piece also represents the four cardinal directions. I haven   t  really explained anything about the red. Red in our tribe means war. White  represents peace. We had a peace culture and a war culture. They both  worked together, had their festivals together, but they decided on war and  34  peace. In fact, somebody that had committed murder could come to a peace  clan, the White clan, and could stay there until they were sure    Then they  were put off on their own to do    whoever, do what they wanted to with  them. You could seek refuge in a white clan. I think they even helped  decide.  Little Thunder Okay, and finally you were going to tell us about this piece.  S. Roberts This is what they called a fire pot. That   s how they transferred their fires  from one dwelling to another. They   d always put out the flame at the Busk,  which was usually around July. They would put out their fire. They would  even burn or do away with their old clothing, everything was to be new.  They say, even some of the later versions, some of the Creek people would  actually say like their vows to be with each other for another year. They  would get their coal of fire and carry it to their new dwelling. A lot of them  would do this every year. A lot of your grounds people, said,    No they don   t  do that. They just did it for transferring fire.    But I was told this, so I don   t  know for sure. I know some of the later model ones, they use this.  (Laughter) Even on hunting trips, you could put some ashes in the bottom of  this and put a coal of fire in this. You could cover that, bank it with some  more ashes. They had one, they put leather thongs right here on both sides.  They carried that, and they would actually have one person tending the fire.  Then when they camped at night, they already had a fire. This was the main  purpose was transporting fire.  Little Thunder Right.  S. Roberts Then you see these things here that always have these knobs on them, and I  have no idea what that   s for unless it was just not as hot there.  Little Thunder Helped pick it up.  35  S. Roberts They always had the handles they could handle it with, so I just don   t know  the purpose.  Little Thunder I guess to wind up, let   s take look at your signature, the ogee on the bottom.  Is it pretty visible on that one, too. Okay? Let   s see. Yeah, you can see it  there. Okay, great. You got your name on there, too and the date.  Interesting. All right. Well, thank you so much for talking with us today,  Scott.  S. Roberts Well, it   s been a pleasure.  Little Thunder I wish you good luck at Red Earth.  S. Roberts I don   t feel that I have anything really showable.  Little Thunder This was the year of the rain. (Laughter)  -------  -------
