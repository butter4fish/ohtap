Swartz: Where did you grow up? I think I read that you were born in Brooklyn.
Litt: [00:00:05] I was born in Brooklyn on December 25, 1940, lived there for
sixteen years until I went off to college at Cornell University in Ithaca, New
York, so I was away for three years, and then after that, went to medical
school back in Brooklyn at the State University of New York. After that, I
did my residency in pediatrics in Manhattan, so I was then there for another
three years.
Swartz: Did you graduate high school early?
Litt: [00:00:42] I did, yes.
Swartz: By two years?
Litt: [00:00:45] Yes, both because of my birthday and school-entry policies, but
also in those days they had a program that was called Special Advancement in
which you could do three years of what was then called junior high school in
two years. So that’s how I managed to graduate from high school at sixteen.
Swartz: Describe your youth and tell me your parents’ occupations. I know your dad
was a doctor.

11

Litt: [00:01:18] My youth in Brooklyn consisted of going to the local elementary
school, which was a block from my home, so I would walk there and back
home for lunch. I then went to the junior high school that was also within
walking distance, after which I attended a very large public high school in
Brooklyn called Erasmus Hall High School. I was a baton twirler and I was
captain of the baton twirlers, which gave me a wider view of the world as we
traveled around with the basketball team and the football team and the band.
Swartz: What places did you get to travel to?
Litt: [00:02:21] In those days it seemed exotic, but we went to New Jersey and we
went to Manhattan. Actually, I got to perform at halftime when our
basketball team was in the championship at Madison Square Garden, so that
was, for me, a big deal, and I did get to march down Fifth Avenue as part of
the St. Patrick’s Day Parade.
Swartz: How did you get into baton twirling?
Litt: [00:02:53] It was something that was intriguing and challenging and just a
new skill to master.
Swartz: And your parents’ occupations?
Litt: [00:03:06] My mother was a math major in high school, which doesn’t sound
that unusual these days, but since she was born in 1910, this was quite
unusual for a woman to be in math. And she went to NYU [New York
University] for college and was vice president of the Math Club, again very
unusual for a woman. Her plan was to teach math, but then she got married
and stayed home to raise kids. But after I was in junior high and my sister in
high school, she finally did become a teacher. Through a strange twist of fate,

12

she became an elementary school teacher, in fact, a kindergarten teacher, and
she enjoyed that thoroughly, but it wasn’t what she had planned to do. She
was also an amateur oil painter, so she had many talents.
My father was a general practitioner in Brooklyn, and I was very
involved with his medical practice on many levels. From the time I was two,
he used to take me on house calls, so I’d go into patients’ homes with him,
which obviously had a profound effect on me. I worked in his office as a
secretary after school and grew up knowing that I would be a doctor,
although I was quite shocked and dismayed to find out when I mentioned
that I was planning to go to medical school, my father just exploded and said,
“Medicine is no career for a woman. You should be a teacher like your
mother, and then you’d be home with the children in the summertime and
after school.” But he did eventually warm to the idea, which was nice.
Swartz: How many siblings do you have?
Litt: [00:05:32] I had a sister who was four years older, who was also an
elementary school teacher, and she died two years ago.
Swartz: And just one sister, so you were the second child?
Litt: [00:05:46] I’m the younger, yes.
Swartz: Did you always think you were going to be a doctor?
Litt: [00:05:55] Yes, from the time I was two.
Swartz: What did your parents expect for you? You said that your father, he expected
you to be a teacher. What did your mom expect for you?
Litt: [00:06:08] She never really clearly said. I think, like most mothers, she wanted
me to be happy, which I have been.

13

Swartz: What were your parents’ attitudes toward your education?
Litt: [00:06:26] They were very supportive of me and whatever I wanted to do in
school.
Swartz: Then what were their attitudes towards marriage?
Litt:- [00:06:43] Again, it was, I think, my father who probably, well, no, clearly,
would have wanted me to wait to get married later than I did, but I did get
married right after I finished college, which I did in three and a half years,
and I got married before I went to medical school. He was not happy about
that.
Swartz: So you were about twenty-one or twenty?
Litt: [00:07:11] I was twenty, the first time I was married.
Swartz: Then what were their attitudes towards motherhood for you?
Litt: [00:07:21] I don’t think they ever—I mean, it was just expected in those days.
Swartz: That you’d have children.
Litt: [00:07:29] That you’d have children. But I don’t remember that it was ever
any issue.
Swartz: Then towards paid work. He wanted you to have a job, but just in teaching,
right?
Litt: [00:07:43] The expectation in our family was that a woman would be
educated and would have paid work. That was never discussed.
Swartz: Did their attitudes influence you at all, do you think?
Litt: [00:08:14] No. [laughs]
Swartz: How come you think you were able to not let that influence what you ended
up doing with your life?

14

Litt: [00:08:23] I think I, in general, had self-confidence, and I was clear about
what I wanted and never really—I mean, except for my father’s initial upset,
I can’t say that I’ve ever had any roadblocks placed before me.
Swartz: You say in your book Taking Our Pulse: The Health of America’s Women, “Why
then after all these years of socialization into the world of medicine did it
come as a surprise to my father when I casually mentioned that I planned to
go to medical school? Because medicine was too demanding a life for a
woman, he protested.” Did his views over the years, or attitude, change at
all?
Litt: [00:09:21] I think once he accepted the idea that I was going to be a doctor,
he was pleased, and enjoyed talking about medicine with me. We went to
some lectures together while I was in medical school, so I think he wound up
liking the idea.
Swartz: Do you think he was worried about you being in a field that was
predominantly male?
Litt: [00:09:42] Yes.
Swartz: That was a major concern, do you think?
Litt: [00:09:44] For sure.
Swartz: Do you think it was just his own narrow viewpoints from the time?
Litt: [00:09:51] He was a product of his time, and I think clearly he was clear
about men’s and women’s roles, and my ambitions didn’t fit in with that.
Swartz: What was going on in the external world when you were growing up, do you
think, that influenced your life’s trajectory?

15

Litt: [00:10:15] Remember, I was born in 1940, and the Second World War
started, or the US involvement. I guess it became the Second World War just
around my first birthday, and I do remember that -- the impact on our
family. Clearly, I didn’t know all the implications, but I remember it being a
very dramatic event. I do remember growing up with blackouts and air-raid
drills and things like that, that you don’t forget when you’re a child. During
those war years, we lived on rations; everybody had rations, so I’m surely
aware of the impact of war, even when the war wasn’t fought on our
territory. I think that’s probably the biggest impact of national or global
events that I can think of as an issue when I was growing up.
Swartz: How did that affect the rest of your life, you think, or just your viewpoints?
Litt: [00:11:45] I think at many subtle levels, I clearly am opposed to war as a way
of solving disputes. I am humbled, recognizing the hardships that war can
cause for people in many ways, so I think it influenced my values in general.
Swartz: What memories do you have, if any, of attitudes towards women, marriage,
motherhood, paid work, and careers?
Litt: [00:12:38] From childhood?
Swartz: Yes, or just from your youth.
Litt: [00:12:42] None of my friends had mothers who worked when I was growing
up in the 40’s and 50’s. I clearly remember coming home at lunchtime and
my mother still being in her bathrobe and kind of living vicariously through
what I reported from the outside world. Early on I must have decided that
that wasn’t for me. And the fact that my mother would have to ask my father
for a quarter so that I could go out and buy some milk, and she never had

16

money of her own, I’m sure that that had an impact at some level on my
desire to not be dependent on anybody else.
Swartz: Did you encounter the women’s movement at all when you were a child or
younger?
Litt: [00:13:44] When women’s movement really started, I was an adult, a young
adult. By that time, I was so busy studying, working in a very demanding
profession where I’d work nights and weekends, in addition to days, and
raising two kids and having a household, and cooking and doing all the
things that one does as a mother and as a professional person, that I was not
actively involved in the women’s movement early on, and, in fact, probably
didn’t allow myself to think about gender discrimination until much later, in
fact probably not until 1990, and that’s another story which we will probably
get into.
Swartz: How did you finance college?
Litt: [00:15:00] I was fortunate enough that my father was able to pay for me for
my tuition, which in those days was $750 a year, which, of course,
proportionally was still a lot of money. It was something that was mainly
covered by my father. I worked every summer to help with incidentals in
college, with my room and board.
Swartz: Where did you work?
Litt: [00:15:32] My first job was as a mail clerk at the telephone company, and
then the subsequent two summers I worked as a typist, and then the third
summer of college, I was a research assistant at Memorial Sloan Kettering

17

Cancer Center in New York, working on an epidemiologic project where I
interviewed patients who had cancer.
Swartz: How did you pay for med school, and did he help with that as well?
Litt: [00:16:14] I was engaged to be married at the time I selected my medical
school. One thing I should say by way of background, in those days, medical
schools had a quota of 10 percent for women, so it was pretty difficult to get
into medical school, and I was applying to New York medical schools
because my husband was working there.
I was accepted at three of the four and decided to go to the State
University of New York solely on the basis of the fact that the tuition was
very low and knew that we could afford it and I wouldn’t have to ask my
parents for any help.
Swartz: As a doctor, what opportunities were there for women? Was there a narrow
amount of jobs that you could take?
Litt: [00:17:42] As I say, not only was there a quota of 10 percent in medical
school, but in fact after medical school if you were going to be a doctor—
you had to have an internship and a residency—and there were quotas there
again. In fact, when I applied to have a residency at New York Hospital in
Cornell, where I really wanted to go, they told me that they had already
chosen “a woman,” and so I wasn’t eligible. But, happily, they did call me a
week later and said they had had a meeting and decided they would take me,
even though I was a woman. And I was required to sign a contract that said I
would not leave during the three years, and subsequently learned that none of

18

the men were asked to sign that contract, any contract. There were many
such biases in the field.
Swartz: Aside from the influence of your father as a doctor, why did you decide to
pursue being a doctor? What was about it that attracted you?
Litt: [00:18:55] I always felt committed to helping people and felt that that was a
very tangible, useful way to help people, so that was really my only
motivation.
Swartz: Who were some of the major influences in your early life?
Litt: [00:19:24] Teachers and relatives and friends, but in terms of any direct
tangible influence, I guess probably the most influential was my fifth-grade
teacher, who was the only male teacher I had in elementary school. That was
unusual to have a male teacher, so he was very different in his whole
approach to teaching, and I think he particularly liked me, so he spent a lot
of time with me. Through that relationship, I really gained a lot of confidence
that I hadn’t had before so I could—
Swartz: What was his name?
Litt: [00:20:12] His name was Sam Margolis. Actually, we had occasion to meet
about three years ago. He lived to be ninety-eight, and so we had a happy
reunion in New York after not seeing him for many years, and that was very
special.
Swartz: How did you guys end up getting together?
Litt: [00:20:34] Somehow somebody was organizing a ninetieth birthday party for
him and somehow tracked me down. But I hadn’t seen him since probably
1970, so it was quite a long hiatus.

19

Swartz: Did he know that you wanted to be a doctor?
Litt: [00:21:09] Yes.
Swartz: And what was his reaction to that?
Litt: [00:21:12] He was very supportive. I think he was that kind of person.
Swartz: Was he a younger teacher?
Litt: [00:21:16] Yes, much younger.
Swartz: How old was he?
Litt: [00:21:20] I don’t think he was more than thirty. He was married and during
the time, those early years, he had two kids, so I don’t think he was more
than thirty.
Swartz: I know you came to Stanford University in 1976. Do you want to just go
through how you ended up coming to Stanford?
Litt: [00:21:42] Yes. After I finished my residency—well, let me back up a little
beyond that. As I implied, I had a hiatus of six months between the time I
graduated from Cornell University (1961) and started medical school, and
being newly married, had to work. So I became a temporary junior high
school science teacher, and I taught seventh grade general science in
Brooklyn, and just loved working with that age group. I really enjoyed it. So
that was important in my subsequent decision to practice medicine with
young people in that age group.
Swartz: That’s funny, because I had read that you did teach junior high school in
Brooklyn, and I was going to ask you how that influenced your research.
Litt: [00:22:37] Yes, that was a very, very big influence. But in those days, the field
of adolescent medicine had not yet been created, so it was a challenge to find

20

an opportunity after my pediatric residency to fulfill my dream. What
subsequently happened was that I learned that there was going to be an
adolescent medicine program starting at the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine in Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx, New York, and applied. They
had no positions there. It was a very new, underfunded program.
A month after I applied, they called to say they had just gotten a grant
from Bronx County, from the judicial system, because of the death of a
young person in the Juvenile Detention Center. The hope was that this new
adolescent program would create a meaningful medical program within the
detention center. So I was offered the job of doing that, which meant that I
would spend half of my day in the detention center and half at the medical
center doing more traditional things. So that was how I got a job in
adolescent medicine, and it turned out to be the best experience in my life
both personally and professionally.
I don’t know how much detail you’re interested in, but in 1968, I did
set up the program, and made it an integral part of the medical school
teaching program, such that all the pediatric residents had to spend time in
the program. And I developed an important screening program and
discovered a lot of health problems that had never been diagnosed, let alone
treated, in this really underserved population of New York City youth. I did
that for five years and then was asked to recreate what I had done there at
the Rikers Island Prison, a maximum security prison in New York City, for
sixteen- to twenty-year-old male inmates.

21

Those were incredibly meaningful experiences to me, both personally
and professionally. I learned a lot about life and about people. The most
important thing is that we established a model that’s been replicated around
the country. As a result, we were able to help major organizations to establish
criteria for health care delivery within detention facilities, so it turned out to
be a very meaningful part of my life.
Swartz: Then after that, you came to Stanford?
Litt: [00:26:21] I came to Stanford because during the course of that kind of
schizophrenic life of spending half of each day in a detention center and the
other half in a more traditional medical center, I found myself really
perplexed by what I was seeing and I was trying to understand behavioral
differences between the two populations of teens. There was at that time a
big drug epidemic in New York, and the kids who wound up in detention
were putting every imaginable substance into their bodies by mouth, by vein,
by injection or whatever, without giving any thought or concern about the
health consequences. The teens at the medical center, on the other hand,
with chronic illnesses like diabetes, were often refusing their medication, not
wanting to take insulin shots or whatever it might have been prescribed as a
medical necessity.
I was perplexed by this dichotomy and trying to understand what
motivates people and their health behavior, and I really craved the
opportunity to learn from people in the behavioral sciences. One of the
attractions of Stanford was exactly that, to have the opportunity to learn with
and from people who had more expertise than I in those areas.

22

Swartz: What was the nature of your first position at Stanford then?
Litt: [00:28:17] I was Director of the Division of Adolescent Medicine within the
Department of Pediatrics, and that was a new division that I started.
Swartz: How did your position at the university change and evolve over time?
Litt: [00:28:37] It grew, first of all, quantitatively, in volume. We attracted a large
number of patients, and that led to my ultimately being able to hire additional
staff, so it became much more of a division. Also, and very importantly,
because I’ve always done my research on the patients and the people that I’ve
worked with, I was able to learn a lot more and do more research and add to
the database in adolescent medicine.
In 1968, I was a charter member of what was called the Society for
Adolescent Medicine, so I and my colleagues around the country were able to
start this new field of adolescent medicine, and my work at Stanford, in
collaboration with a number of my colleagues here, really helped to add to
our understanding of adolescent growth and development and then later,
health behaviors.
My research since coming to Stanford initially focused on teenagers’
willingness to take prescribed medication or to follow physicians’ advice.
Then later, with my colleagues in child psychiatry, I started a major program
in eating disorders of teenagers. That age group had never been studied from
the perspective of the physical consequences of eating disorders.
Understanding of the impact of starvation, for example, before pubertal
growth is completed, has added to our understanding of many aspects of
growth in otherwise healthy individuals. Over time, through my work and

23

getting to know people in different parts of Stanford, and working with my
colleagues in other disciplines, ultimately led to my having very rewarding
positions elsewhere on the campus, not just in the medical school.
Swartz: You were a professor at the medical center?
Litt: [00:31:42] I became a professor ultimately, a tenured professor, and then I
had an endowed professorship (The Marron and Mary Elizabeth Kendrick
Professor of Pediatrics).
Swartz: Then you were also at the institute.
Litt: [00:31:53] I was Director of the Institute for Research on Women and
Gender (now the Clayman Institute for Gender Research).
Swartz: From 1990 to 1997, right?
Litt: [00:31:59] Yes. You did your homework.
Swartz: You’re really interesting to read about.
Litt: [00:32:02] Thank you. That, by the way, was a half-time position and a
rotating directorship which fell to a woman professor in different schools at
the university, which was a good idea.
Swartz: Were you satisfied with the different positions you had at Stanford then?
Litt: [00:32:23] Yes, and I don’t know how current the material was that you
looked at, but I’ve been Director of the Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences at Stanford (2009-11, 2013-4), so that was another very
rewarding position.
Swartz: Are you still doing that one?
Litt: [00:32:42] No, I finished April 1st, 2014.
Swartz: Are you officially in retirement now?

24

Litt: [00:32:55] I am.
Swartz: You’re doing these interesting lectures and talks then.
Litt: [00:32:59] I am, and have become a full-time glass artist.
Swartz: Glassblowing or—
Litt: [00:33:08] No, I do kiln cast and fused glass, like that [Iris Litt points at an
object in the room].
Swartz: Describe the reactions of your faculty colleagues towards you during your
first years at Stanford (in the mid-seventies).
Litt: [00:33:24] Hmm. It varied, but I think the main early reaction was that many
of my colleagues who had experienced difficulty treating teenagers may have
had unrealistic expectations that I would magically solve all of those
problems for them in terms of managing teenage patients. I think over time
we did a lot to help to increase understanding and to develop methods that
were useful to my colleagues.
Swartz: Have those reactions or did those reactions change over the years?
Litt: [00:34:47] Yes. There’s been a lot of very good support from a lot of very
good colleagues and sharing of data, and it’s been a very positive experience.
Swartz: You don’t have to answer this question if you don’t want to, but can you
describe your relationship with your male colleagues?
Litt: [00:35:05] Well, all of my colleagues were male. [laughs]
Swartz: OK.
Litt: [00:35:09] You’ve got very few women until very recently. We’ve always had
good relationships.

25

Swartz: Did the relationships change over time, though, or is it kind of the same as
you were describing where they thought you were going to have like the Holy
Grail for—
Litt: [00:35:27] I think they came to learn a lot and enjoy what they were learning
and understand that that’s not the way it’s done, so, sure, it improved, but it
was never terrible.
Swartz: What was the departmental culture like?
Litt: [00:35:46] When I came, the longtime chairman of the department, who
remained chairman for many, many years, was very autocratic, and it was not
a participatory democracy by any means. I think all of the faculty felt that we
had little to say in the running of the department.
Swartz: Was he around for a while?
Litt: [00:36:21] For a long time, yes. It became very clear that throughout my
career I’ve been paid in the lowest quartile once they started publishing
salaries, which they didn’t do early on. But that was always the case, so I
think that reflected the departmental leadership, to be sure. In fact, when he
left, the acting director said that he had taken the job because he thought that
everybody in the department had been unfairly treated as far as salaries, and
he said the good news is he discovered that was not the case. The bad news
was that there was one case where that was true, and it was me.
Swartz: How long did it take you to find out that you were being paid a lot less?
Litt: [00:37:28] For many years, they didn’t publish salaries, and I can’t remember
when they started publishing them, but surely, this would have been 1990
when this acting young department chairman discovered that I had been

26

underpaid. So that was 1990, and he did give me a substantial raise, but it’s
still “you’re behind when you’re in a system for so long.”
Swartz: What was your reaction to finding out about the salary?
Litt: [00:38:04] I mean, I knew, but I just never could prove it.
Swartz: You had to work your way up?
Litt: [00:38:20] Well, the raises in the system are very minimal each year.
Swartz: So you go along a path.
Litt: [00:38:28] Yes.
Swartz: What were your salary and perks like when you started? Was it impressive, or
you just knew that it was lower than other people?
Litt: [00:38:44] It was low, and I don’t remember the numbers. But the other
thing is that I subsequently learned that the men and the others who had
been hired had research funds, which I was never given. So whatever I did
over all these years, it was really on a shoestring because I never had funding
from the department.
Swartz: You said there weren’t that many other women there. Did you see other
women get ostracized though during your time there?
Litt: [00:39:20] It was not anything systemic. There were incidents, but nothing
that I could point to as being—it wasn’t the pervasive culture. There weren’t
enough of us. [laughs]
Swartz: How did the culture change over your time at Stanford then?
Litt: [00:39:41] As far as women?
Swartz: Yes.
Litt: [00:39:44] As more women came in, I think it normalized the culture.

27

Swartz: Was there a moment where you said, “Wow. Now things are a lot different
than when I first started”?
Litt: [00:39:57] No, no, absolutely gradual. And the other thing to recognize is that
there are so few women. There was only one other senior woman until
probably the 1990s.
Swartz: Oh, my gosh.
Litt: [00:40:15] So whenever they needed a woman or decided that they need a
woman on a committee, you’re the one, because there wasn’t a pool to
choose from. So it impacted other things, because in order to provide that
kind of service, for example, there are things you can’t do if you’re doing
that. So I think the women felt really stretched and disproportionately, let’s
say, burdened by other responsibilities because there were so few of them.
They, like I, felt an obligation (as well as a pleasure) to mentor the younger
women.
Swartz: When you were at Stanford, were you working primarily with the undergrads
or graduate students, or both?
Litt: [00:41:03] Very little with undergraduates, mainly with medical students,
graduate students who were medical students, and then residents, interns,
and fellows were the other trainees.
Swartz: What was the reaction of the students to your gender when you first arrived?
Litt: [00:41:25] You mean to teaching them about adolescence? Is that what you
mean?
Swartz: Or just in general, what was their reaction to you being a woman?

28

Litt: [00:41:38] I think for the trainees, for the younger people, it wasn’t as much
of an issue. I mean, coming from New York where there’s much more of a
hierarchical system, I have to say I was surprised when they called me by my
first name. That was something that would never happen back East, and I
realized it wasn’t because I was a woman; they did that with everybody. So I
think it’s just in a number of ways a different teaching culture.
Swartz: Did you like them calling you by your first name?
Litt: [00:42:18] It was just a surprise. But I have to say probably there were some
distinct advantages of being a woman vis-à-vis the medical students, because
I remember I had a group of four students, or were there six? Anyway, half
of them were women and half were men. On one particular day, the men
were not there, just happened, illness or whatever, and the women began
talking about sexual abuse, their own, and that surely never would have come
up if I had been a man.
Swartz: They wouldn’t have been as comfortable.
Litt: [00:43:06] Exactly! I think that there were those opportunities that men
would not have had in this context. And, some years later, I established and
directed the House Staff Well-Being Committee, and again, being a woman
was advantageous. And I mentored a lot of women residents and faculty
because I think there is more of an affinity for a woman in those roles.
Swartz: Have you kept in touch with a lot of those people?
Litt: [00:43:43] Sure.
Swartz: Do you track their progress?
Litt: [00:43:45] Very definitely.

29

Swartz: Are some of them still at Stanford?
Litt: [00:43:49] A few are here as well as around this country, in Europe and Asia.
Swartz: How did students’ reactions to you change over the years? Did you see any
differences from when you first started?
Litt: [00:44:04] I probably did, especially as I got more white hair. The age may
have created barriers. I don’t know, maybe not. Perhaps they viewed me
more as a grandmother instead of a mother although I was never really aware
of any differences.
Swartz: Can you describe your progress towards tenure?
Litt: [00:44:36] That was a sticky issue. I came from, as I mentioned, Albert
Einstein College of Medicine [in New York] where I had just become an
associate professor, and they did not have a tenure system there, so I was an
associate professor without tenure, but nobody had tenure. I came to
Stanford in 1976 and didn’t really appreciate the differences until I was here
in the tenure system, which obviously is a very important system here and
has many implications.
But I accepted the appointment as a parallel appointment of associate
professor without tenure, and in the usual sequence of things, after six years
you’re reviewed for promotion to the next level, to professor. And in my
case, after six years, I was promoted to the position of associate professor
with tenure, rather than professor. And then another six years went by, and
then I was finally promoted to professor. So it took me twelve years to
become professor, whereas most men did it in six.
Swartz: What happened to you wasn’t typical for men, but for women?

30

Litt: [00:46:15] Right, and subsequently—well, I won’t go into any of the
background, but yes. So I was in that sense surely treated differently, and the
only explanation, really, was gender.
Swartz: Did you try to pursue getting the tenure sooner or getting this professor
position sooner, or is it something you just accepted at the time?
Litt: [00:46:40] No, I think, again, like many women, I was kind of passive. I
mean, it’s hard for young women like yourself and others today to imagine
what it was like to grow up when we did, and especially going back to having
been accepted to medical school when there was a 10 percent quota. The
whole culture there was the expectation that women would drop out; they
wouldn’t complete medical school. So they saved the positions for the men,
because they would. That was the whole attitude. So we were very grateful to
be there, and that sort of was pervasive as we went through our career. You
don’t make waves, and just be grateful for what you have. So that sort of was
what I grew up with.
Swartz: Did you meet with any other women at Stanford to strategize on how to
level the playing field at all?
Litt: [00:47:44] No, but by the time there were enough women there, I mean, I
was very much a senior woman. I advised a number of them, but it wasn’t by
any means a collective thing.
Swartz: How has your field changed in terms of gender over the years?
Litt: [00:48:01] Particularly, pediatrics is now about half and half, men and
women, and as you know, medical school admissions are more even in that
regard as well, although I have to say that there are still not many women in

31

leadership positions in medical schools. They are still underrepresented,
greatly underrepresented, as deans or department chairs. There are more than
there used to be, but there are still nowhere near equitable as far as gender.
Swartz: Have you seen a critical mass of women enter your department or field,
though?
Litt: [00:48:41] Sure.
Swartz: And does that matter?
Litt: [00:48:44] Of course it matters. It matters in terms of qualitative differences
and research interests and in providing role models for younger women who
can now see that there is a future for them in the field. And there are a lot of
interesting ramifications of this. For example, it’s been shown that in
recruiting subjects for research studies for clinical trials, like in cancer,
women doctors are much more successful than men in recruiting patients.
That’s just one example, but there are a number like that. So you need both.
Swartz: In terms of your research, I know that you wanted to answer a lot of
unanswered questions surrounding women’s health. What’s one of the
biggest unanswered questions that you think you answered during your
research over the years?
Litt: [00:49:52] I think taken as a body of work I’ve done, as I look back on it, is
that I entered areas where there was very little information known about the
particular population. Whether it was prisoners or detainees, whether it was
teenagers, or whether it was women, I was able to both study and help in the
understanding of the issues of all of these disparate populations, and I have

32

also influenced people to follow me, to join me in this fascinating exploration
of the unknown.
Swartz: What’s one important thing about adolescent women’s bodies that you
learned in your research that you think girls should know that they don’t
realize about themselves?
Litt: [00:51:04] One that has very broad implications and is kind of interesting as
you reflect on the history of the field. My concern—and this was back in the
early 1980s—was that the young women who had eating disorders of the
anorexia nervosa variety, who were obviously not eating enough of the things
they needed to grow and be healthy, were clearly avoiding anything that they
perceived as having a lot of fat. Dairy products, for example, cheese and ice
cream and milk, were something they would avoid assiduously. I was
concerned about what that might do to their bones, especially because the
other part of anorexia nervosa is that your estrogen levels are lower. The
combination sounded like a high-risk situation if we extrapolate from older
women with osteoporosis.
We decided to study the bone density of these young women, but in
order to make any sense of what we might find, we had to compare them to
normal healthy controls who didn’t have eating disorders. What we’ve
learned was that up until that point in time, nobody had ever done bone
density studies on teenage girls because the focus was on postmenopausal
women. We had to start from scratch and do our own studies of normal
teenage girls just so we would have a comparison for the kids with eating
disorders. We learned a lot about teens with eating disorders, obviously,

33

namely that they had very low bone densities. We learned also that they were
different from postmenopausal women who might have had the same low
bone density, in that theirs was reversible as their nutrition improved. So that
was important. But very importantly, we learned a lot about normal growth
and development of bones in normal healthy young women, because they
had never been studied before. And we learned that you get most of your
bone density during that second decade of life.
Swartz: In your twenties?
Litt: [00:53:42] Yes. And we also learned that things like low-fat milk, for example,
which is not going to add a lot of calories, has more protein and calcium than
the higher fat content milk. So it got a lot of us interested in trying to
convince young women that these were things that were healthy and
important for their development and it would not make them fat.
Swartz: Having low-fat milk versus whole milk.
Litt: [00:54:17] Yes, and low-fat everything, milk, cheese, whatever. Anyway, that’s
one very significant thing we learned.
Swartz: And girls today still don’t realize that—
Litt: [00:54:30] We’ve had limited success, shall we say. But we know a whole lot
more. That’s the important thing.
Swartz: Tell me about the people or organizational units who are key to your success
at Stanford.
Litt: [00:55:02] I think as an institution, Stanford is surely much more supportive
of interdisciplinary research, and so as a culture, I’ve surely been the
beneficiary of that. I think the size and the structure of Stanford surely lends

34

itself to collaboration across schools in a way that most other universities
don’t have. Surely being in a traditional vertical medical center, as I had been
before, you don’t have the opportunities that I’ve had here at Stanford. I
think if there’s any one department or office at Stanford, I would say the
Office of the Dean of Research is probably the one that is most important in
fostering this kind of interdisciplinary interaction.
Swartz: You were the Director of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender.
What do you think were the most valuable things you gained personally and
professionally, as a director there?
Litt: [00:56:18] Personally, there’s no question that it helped me to become a
feminist, because I didn’t really know what the word meant before, and I, like
so many people, misunderstood it. I’ve now realized, or began to realize then,
that it meant equal opportunities for women, which is something of course I
have always been supportive of.
Swartz: What did you think it meant before?
Litt: [00:56:46] I thought it meant that you hate men and burn bras. That was the
image in the world that I grew up, so clearly that’s not me.
The other sidebar to that, which is kind of amusing, is that my older
son, when he was at UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles] Law
School, was the co-editor of the Women’s Law Journal, and he always teases me
that he became a feminist before I did. And he’s married to a professional
woman. Both my sons are married to professional women, so I think they’ve
grown up with a different image of women’s roles, and they’ve been very
supportive, both of me and, I’d say, of women.

35

But the other real joy of being at the institute and what it taught me
was about cross-fertilization of ideas across disciplines — because there were
mainly humanists there and really no other scientists when I first got there —
we were able to form groups where we talked to each other and learned from
each other.
It’s actually interesting when they approached me about being the
director, it’s a funny story because I got a phone message saying that the
search committee for the directorship of the institute wanted to talk to me,
and I thought, “OK,” and I sat down and I wrote out a list of women that I
could think of across the campus who might be good as directors. I called
them back, and I told them I had this list. And they said, “No, no, we want
to talk to you about you being the director.”
And I said, “Well, I have no feminist credentials and I don’t do
feminist research. Why would you want me?”
And they said, “We have to talk.” I had defined my research as
focusing on “teenagers.” To the search committee, however, my research on
pregnancy prevention, on eating disorders, on sexually transmitted diseases
was on “women’s issues.” Their redefinition really changed the way I looked
at these things.
After accepting the position of director, I delighted in meeting with my
medical school colleagues and posing the same challenge to them. I would
say, “Have you ever analyzed your data on the basis of gender differences?”
In those days, the early 1990s, the typical response was that they hadn’t. In
many cases, once they started examining their results for possible gender

36

differences they learned all kinds of new wonderful things, and in many
cases, it changed the direction of their research, as it had mine.
Swartz: Are women’s health services and treatment better than when you were a
young woman?
Litt: [01:00:35] Yes and no, but I can’t say that it’s uniform. There are some places
where the information that’s been gleaned by these various studies have
really made a difference, and there are wonderful, inclusive services for
women that are badly needed. In most places around the world, however,
women’s health issues are still defined in terms of their reproductive function
alone, despite the voluminous evidence of major health differences
throughout the body. The assumption is that other doctors take care of those
problems, and having an integrated women’s health program is still the
exception.
One of the major contributors to our expanded understanding of
women’s health issues was the Women’s Health Initiative, a major
longitudinal research study. Marcia Stefanick, who’s here at Stanford, and the
head of WSDM, was the major researcher in that study, and we’ve learned an
awful lot that’s important that was not known before, and that’s really
informed the delivery of health care to women. We’ve made a lot of
progress, but there’s still a lot that needs to be done, and most people don’t
recognize that.
Swartz: What did you enjoy most about writing your book, Taking Our Pulse: The
Health of America’s Women?

37

Litt: [01:02:06] Like with any research project that you do, I learned a lot. I
derived pleasure from hearing that it was helpful to a lot of people in
understanding the depth and the breadth of women’s health problems. I was
pleased to hear that it was being used in some courses in medical schools
around the country, even though that wasn’t exactly my target, but that was
rewarding. I have to say, for the record, it’s now very much out of date,
especially the section on postmenopausal hormone replacement. So if I ever
have time, I might update it.
Swartz: How long did it take you to write that book?
Litt: [01:02:57] Conservatively speaking, a year, but I was doing other things too.
Swartz: You told me that you’ve been married, but you said you’ve been married
twice?
Litt: [01:03:17] No, I’ve been married three times.
Swartz: OK.
Litt: [01:03:19] Yes. I was married to my high school sweetheart for twenty-five
years, and he’s the father of my two sons, and I’m still very close with him.
My late husband was a very renowned academic leader in pediatrics,
Victor C. Vaughan, III, with whom I collaborated actually before we were
married on the book that is called Child and Development: Clinical Implications.
We were married for fourteen years.
And for the last ten years I’ve been married to one of my adolescent
medicine colleagues, Dale C. Garell. We were both widowed about the same
time when we decided to embark on another chapter.
Swartz: How did your different marriages affect your career?

38

Litt: [01:04:20] While I was having and raising my children, my first husband’s
role in sharing child care responsibilities, especially at night when I was on
call, was critically important. I couldn’t have done it without him.
My late husband and I had professional ties: we worked together in the
American Board of Pediatrics and the National Board of Medical Examiners
and coauthored the book, so we shared a lot of intellectual pediatric interests.
He was a terrific editor and taught me a lot in my role as editor-in-chief of
the Journal of Adolescent Health over my 14-year tenure.
Then Dale, my current husband, has been very actively supportive and
involved in my role as director of these programs. I also have been in the last
decade, almost coincident with our marriage, in a career development award
program for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and that involved site
visits and traveling. So he’s always been supportive and involved. He was an
invaluable support in my most recent stints as Director of The Center for
Advanced Study in the Behavioral Science here at Stanford.
Swartz: So to what extent did your different spouses affect your career choices and
achievements?
Litt: [01:06:00] Achievements along the lines of what I just said; their support has
been invaluable in different ways. I don’t think it affected choices per se.
Swartz: And so you have two sons?
Litt: [01:06:10] Yes and two little granddaughters, Abigail and Mira Litt!
Swartz: How old are they now?
Litt: [01:06:14] Bill was born in 1967. He’s a public-interest attorney and is the
deputy county counsel for Monterey County. And then his younger brother,

39

Robert—is what he likes to be called now—Bob was born in 1971. He has a
degree in landscape architecture and is author with his wife Hannah of A
Chicken in Every Yard, and proprietor of The Urban Farm Store in Portland,
Oregon. I am also blessed with nine step-children, 12 step-grandchildren and
3 step-great-grandchildren!
Swartz: Is Litt your maiden name?
Litt: [01:07:00] No, Litt is my first husband’s name. Again, in those days, you took
your husband’s name when you got married.
Swartz: Can having a family be compatible with a life of women faculty members?
Litt: [01:07:17] I’ve done it, and I would say that each informs the other, and each
makes the other more interesting. So I think resoundingly the answer is yes,
but it’s not to say it’s easy. Things like choice of spouses are critically
important. And I’m just thinking of Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to
Lead. It suggests that what you should be doing before you marry anybody is
to ask if the prospective spouse is willing to do the laundry. I think that’s a
good proxy measure!
Swartz: Have you met Sheryl Sandberg [author of Lean In] before?
Litt: [01:08:10] I’ve met her, yes.
Swartz: What do you think?
Litt: [01:08:12] I think she’s terrific. I think she’s right on, and I think she really
should be commended for doing what she’s doing. I know she’s received a
lot of criticism by people who say, well, you can afford to do what you’re
doing, but she’s very thoughtful and mindful of the fact that most women in
this country did not have the opportunities that she’s had and the financial

40

resources, and she, I think, is sensitive to their plight, and I think what she’s
doing is terrific.
Swartz: Do you think that your work influenced your sons?
Litt: [01:08:52] Absolutely. I mean, they say as much, and, as I say, they’re both
married to professional women.
Swartz: What do their wives do?
Litt: [01:09:00] Bill’s wife is a caseworker, but she’s actually aspiring to go to law
school. They’re recently married. She’s a lot younger. Bob’s wife is a nurse
midwife.
Swartz: Do you want to just kind of describe the crux of your research so that’s kind
of on the record?
Litt: [01:09:52] There were a number of discrete areas of research interest over the
years. I can do it chronologically. I would say that the first was to do research
of a more epidemiologic kind, which was to really learn about the types and
range of health problems for underserved youth and those in detention
settings, to really raise awareness of the tremendous need for improved
health care services of kids who are in those settings.
I also did a lot of research on pregnancy prevention and trying to
improve teenagers’ willingness to prevent pregnancy, either by abstinence,
which is a very difficult message to sell, but, more realistically, to teach them
and understand their attitudes towards methods of birth control.
Then I did actually lab research to try and understand and improve the
treatment of withdrawal from various opiate medications in teens who
abused heroin and related substances and barbiturates. I also did laboratory

41

research to understand the effect of using some of these substances on their
liver function and on their hormonal status.
I also did research later on in a broad range, as I mentioned earlier, of
health behaviors among teenagers and their willingness to follow physicians’
instructions and prescriptions. And then a large body of research in studying
the impact of eating disorders on growth and development in teenagers. I’ve
also done work on sleep disorders in teenagers and again relating that to
pubertal development.
Swartz: In your experience, have Stanford policies and procedures changed over the
years in a way that accommodate female faculty more?
Litt: [01:12:42] Yes. Stanford has tried to improve the recruitment of women and
retention of women, and one of the ways is that they do stop the tenure
clock when women become pregnant, so that they’re not under as much
pressure to accomplish a certain body of work before they’re up for
promotion or tenure. So I think that’s very good.
They’ve done a number of things in terms of providing support to
women in child care areas. There’s a help center on campus where women
staff and faculty can get help with issues.
Swartz: I think I was reading that you didn’t get to take maternity leave.
Litt: [01:13:33] They didn’t have maternity leave. I had my first child in the midst
of a ten-day vacation, which was all we had. And the second, I was then a
junior faculty member, and I had a month’s vacation, so that’s when I had
my second child. So they didn’t have maternity leave.
Swartz: From a standpoint of a doctor, what do you think of maternity leave?

42

Litt: [01:14:03] I think it’s very important, critical.
Swartz: What do you think about the paternity leave now that some companies are
offering?
Litt: [01:14:13] I think it’s wonderful. I was dismayed to learn that it’s very rarely
taken, and I think that reflects the culture of a lot of these places where there
isn’t support. I mean even though there’s permission given, there isn’t
support among colleagues for the people who take it, and I think that’s a
shame.
