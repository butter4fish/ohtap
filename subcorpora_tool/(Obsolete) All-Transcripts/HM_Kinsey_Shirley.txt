Story_ID: 650203
Speaker 1: Now before we go into depth, there are five lightweight questions that we ask as kind of a warm up.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they only--they don't require anything but a short answer.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The first one is do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh boy, yes.  I'd have to say it's--I like eggplant parmesan. (Laughter) That's one of my favorites actually.  So it's Italian, I like Italian food.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay all right.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color is yellow, even though I don't wear it often but it just kind of reminds me of happiness and I like it.  I like sunflowers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Actually this time of year, fall kind of leading into the first few weeks or so of winter.  Yeah, the sunsets are beautiful this time of year.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Two I'll say.  I would probably say Italy for one because we go there quite frequently and then the other would be Kenya, Africa actually.  Somewhere we've been only once and every year we keep saying we're gonna go back but it's, it's a feeling of home, yeah, so yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I have two.  One I'll say is one that I strive to live by actually and it's to whom much is given, much is required and that simply means that you have to pay things back, pay it forward and then the other one I just kind of come across.  I think I heard someone say this but I can't recall who exactly. But that we are the answer to the prayers of our ancestors; and so that's a phrase that I like to use.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Story_ID: 650204
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and then your father's [Eddie Pooler] side and then--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) we'll put them together (unclear).
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: My mother's name Erma, E-R-M-A, Lee, L-E-E, maiden name Lofton, L-O-F-T-O-N, married name Pooler, P-O-O-L-E-R [Erma Lee Lofton Pooler].
Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: She was born in Lake City, Florida, and I don't have the date of birth.  She's deceased.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you think it was sometime in 1920s?
Speaker 2: Oh I'm sorry; I should have said that, yes.  It had to be--my dad's '25 [1925]--1927.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, she's two years younger than my dad.  I think that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what are the stories?
Speaker 2: My mother's, my mother's mother her name was Blanche Brown Lofton and her father was I only knew his nickname was Pig Lofton and they were both deceased before I was born so I really don't know very much about them.
Speaker 1: Is there a story about the name Pig?
Speaker 2: I probably have heard it but I really can't remember.  My mother had one sister, my Aunt Rosa [Rosalie Lofton Williams], and she's passed now too and I haven't, I don't know.  Unh-uh.  They were raised by--actually their parents died when they were like young teenagers I believe and so they were raised by an aunt, Aunt Lovie, Aunt Lovie Brown, yeah raised them.
Speaker 1: This is your grandfather's--your grandfather or your grandmother?
Speaker 2: That would have been my grandmother's side of the family, yeah, my grandma Blanche Brown side of the family yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she was raised by your relatives?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Um-hm.  She used to tell me stories, my Aunt Rosa used to tell me stories about they would be in town in Lake City sometime and this Caucasian man would be on his horse and buggy and he would point to them if he was with someone else and say those were his--he used the word, the N word those were his N grandchildren.  So I do know that part.  So I need to go back a little further with that.
Speaker 1: So you think it was some truth to that that he's actually related (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, 'cause they--yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --related to that white man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Is that where the name Brown comes from or?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking so, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of work did your grandfather do?
Speaker 2: I don't know that either.
Speaker 1: So did he live in the town of Lake City?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he probably was a farmer because everybody kind of lived outside.  It might have been--it actually might have been a, because Aunt Lovie lived on a farm.  I'm gonna say they were farmers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So was your mother raised on a farm or--I mean or?
Speaker 2: Um-hm 'cause I remember when I was growing up I used to go visit Aunt Lovie and there were I remember there were pigs and I remember chickens, and I remember, I don't remember any crops but I knew they had tobacco and cotton in Lake City.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  Now, did your mother share any stories about growing up that she shared with you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, she--my mother actually died when I was two. Yeah, so and my, her sister, my aunt, I knew when I was about in first grade but I didn't really spend any time with her until I got to be about sixteen and I guess at that time I just wasn't asking a lot of questions.
Speaker 1: Now, okay so were you raised by your father basically?
Speaker 2: My father's mother [Susie Plummer Pooler], um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  All right.  So, so is there--did your mother have a chance to go to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, she did graduate high school I'm pretty sure.  I know my dad did so I believe she did some too.  She was nineteen when they got married I know and I was born two years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think she was seventeen; she might have been seventeen when they got married.  I can't recall right off hand right now.
Speaker 1: Right out of high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650205
Speaker 1: Well let's go to your father's side and can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: His name is Eddie, E-D-D-I-E, middle name James, J-A-M-E-S, last name Pooler, P-O-O-L-E-R [Eddie Pooler].
Speaker 1: And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Now his I know.  He's May 17, 1925.  And he was born in Lake City, Florida, also.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well what can you tell us about his side of the family?
Speaker 2: Okay his mother is Susie.
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Okay, we were talking about your grandmother Susie Plummer Pooler?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So she raised you right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, she raised me.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: With some help from my dad but he was basically gone, worked on the railroad so he was gone a lot of times but she was my main source, yeah and she was a widow before I was born so she--there was no grandfather in my life then either.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Well, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 1: His name is Edfield, E-D-F-I-E-L-D.  I don't know what--I think his middle name is James, J-A-M-E-S.  Last name Pooler, P-O-O-L-E-R [Edfield Pooler].
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  And, so, so how far back can you trace that side?  Can you go back further than your grandparents?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, I can go mama, my grandmother's dad, so that would have been my great-grandfather was Cyrus Plummer.  I do know that and I never knew the name of her mother though.  She had a stepmom whose name was Lutie [Lutie Plummer], L-U-T-I-E.  I don't know what her maiden name was at all.  And mom had--my grandmother had a brother--a sister and a brother and I knew the brother quite well and that was his name was Andrew Jackson Plummer, Sr. [Andrew Plummer, Sr.].
Speaker 2: So he's your great uncle?
Speaker 1: Great uncle, um-hm, quite close to him.  And they were all born in Lake City, Florida.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.  Well, did your father have any stories about growing up?
Speaker 1: Yes.  But he had one sister and two--an older sister and two older brothers and he being the baby, the two boys went in the [U.S. military] service I know early on and then he was left with mama and since mama had no husband either, my dad was there with her.  I know they lived on a farm and I know that he, he talked about having to--tobacco, you know cut the tobacco and stuff and all.  Doesn't talk about picking cotton at all, but tobacco was the main crop and they left St. Augustine and moved--I'm sorry left Lake City to move to St. Augustine in 1948, no. Yeah about '48 [1948] I think after my mother [Erma Lee Lofton Pooler] died.  I was about two and they moved there because he said he couldn't help mama with the farm anymore because it was just the two of them there and you know they had no help and stuff. And I, to be honest with you, I don't know if they were sharecroppers or what, I'm not sure about that because when I think about it I don't know he never talks about them selling the farm to move to St. Augustine, but that they moved to St. Augustine (unclear)--
Speaker 2: So they moved there when?
Speaker 1: To St. Augustine, Florida.
Speaker 2: When?
Speaker 1: Nineteen forty--I'm a say '48 [1948].  I, I always say I was two years old when--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --when we moved there.  It was after my mother had died I know.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: 'Cause it was just mama and my dad.
Speaker 2: Okay so you were raised in St. Augustine?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.  That's actually where I grew up yeah.  I don't remember growing up in Lake City you know two years in Lake City I don't remember at all, except for going back to visit sometime.
Speaker 2: All right.  Okay.  And your father never served in the service because--
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: --he was the only one--
Speaker 1: Right he was the only male left.
Speaker 2: Okay so what did he--he worked for the railroad, you said, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Um-hm.  My uncle, mama's brother, my Uncle Plummer, the, the, her brother was the cook on the railroad, the Flagler railroad line [Florida East Coast Railway] and he was the reason they moved to St. Augustine because he was there and he said that he could find a job for him on the railroad.  So he worked at and he told me about this, he worked where they, where they had to switch the rail line. So I guess it was at a switching station and had to repair the railroad tires and stuff so he was gone most of the time.  He'd be out, out of town, he'd be in West Palm Beach [Florida] and Jacksonville [Florida] and other places but some distance away that he wasn't home you know all the time he come home you know once, twice a month or so.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Okay.  Now, did your father have a chance to finish high school?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did finish high school, um-hm (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.  So in Lake City?
Speaker 1: In Lake City yeah.
Speaker 2: Right. Okay.
Speaker 1: Richardson High School [Lake City, Florida].
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: I remember that.
Story_ID: 650206
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met that your father [Eddie Pooler] told?
Speaker 2: You know, can't--I can remember a little bit of that, yeah.  I have a first cousin my dad's sister's child, Barbara [Barbara Richardson Johnson], who I call my sister cousin because we kind of grew up together but she--and it was obviously before I was born, she was like the baby in the family at the time and she's about five years older than me and my dad would tell a story about going to go see my mother [Erma Lee Lofton Pooler], going to visit and he would always carry Barbara with him because she was such a pretty little girl (laughter) and so my mother would get a chance to kind of play with Barbara and he get a chance to get a little closer to her.  He said but he would go to visit and my grandfather [Pig Lofton] would say--would sit in the same room with them and he try and talk to her and my grandfather would say, "What is that you're saying?"  And he say, "I'm trying to talk to your daughter," and my grandfather would say, "Yes, but I need to hear what you're saying to her," you know so those kind of stories and stuff would come out.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: That was real tight supervision.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.  My dad's kind of tall and my mom was short.  She was I think she's was over 5' but her sister [Rosalie Lofton Williams] was only about 5' tall.  My dad's like 6'1" maybe and I think my mother was maybe 5', 5'2" something like that.  So yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So but they got married right after high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I was born in '46 [1946] so they got married in '44 [1944].
Speaker 1: Forty-four [1944] okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact I think I just ran across the marriage certificate the other day.  Yeah, I did and it was in, it was in December I think of '44 [1944] they were married I believe.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 650207
Speaker 1: When you--well, you know, from what you know of your mother [Erma Lee Lofton Pooler]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --and you know what you know of your father [Eddie Pooler], what do you know about how they looked, how they you know how people perceived them--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --their interests and talents, who do you, think you take after?
Speaker 2: I look more like my father actually.  I didn't think I used to but I do as I look at him now especially.  And he looks a lot like my grandmother [Susie Plummer Pooler] so it's more that side of the family so and that was--I think it's more as the Plummer side of the family more so than the Poolers because my, my cousins who are Plummers, we kind of all look alike and so that was it and so we all look like the Plummer side of the family.  My--although I must admit on my mother's side of the family, she had a first cousin who is no longer alive now either, but she used to tell me that at my mother's funeral, she said I would--I came up to her as if to say are you my mom she say because everybody thought they looked a lot alike and when I looked at her I been in Lake City [Florida] and I've gone to the store there just a few years ago and I went in and I had never been in the store before and the clerk said to me, she knew who my family was.  She said, "You must be a Lofton?"  It's a small town.  She said, "You must be a Lofton," and I said, "Well how did you know?"  And so I told her, yeah I was related to Loftons and she said, "Because you look like them."  But I never thought I looked like them.  I always thought I looked more like my dad as I've gotten older.  But maybe at that time you know as a younger person I was kind of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, people in those towns know.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, they do know.  And this was a Caucasian woman actually in the store and she said, "'Cause you look like them."  I'm like, "I do?"  It was kind of weird. Good feeling though you know because there are, there are a lot of Loftons still in Lake City and they were a lot of them were my mother's first cousins, but I never really got to know them that well.  I have one--I'm kind learning a little bit more about them now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm supposing there's a good chance you took a lot of characteristics after your grandmother--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who raised you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  It's--matter of fact the cousins all now say that my aunt, well one of my aunts used to tell me that I stand like my grandmother.  I put my hands on my hip like her and then I was with a younger cousin here at Thanksgiving time, she's about seventeen years younger than me really, my first cousin though, and she said to me, "Look at you, you remind me so much of grandma."  I said, "Yeah okay."
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: And I know for instance mama was the one who always kept up with everybody's birthday.  She kept everybody in touch with everybody and so I seem to be the one doing all of that too.  I--everybody knows that, you know, if I know who all the cousins are, and who's doing what and you know all that kind of stuff so.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Mama was, she was my shero frankly.
Story_ID: 650208
Speaker 1: So when you grew up then you had--it was--you had two brothers and yourself, or was that?
Speaker 2: Well the brothers are (laughter)--you're gonna laugh at this now, my dad [Eddie Pooler] remarried when I was nine I think it was.  Yeah he remarried when I was nine. And married a younger woman [Albertha Haire Pooler].  She's only eleven years older than me so and they started a family.  So I have five brothers and sisters but they're my dad's children you know so they're my half-sisters and brothers and my brothers are much younger.  My--I have a brother who's a year younger than my son [Khalil Kinsey], a thirty-five year old brother (laughter), a forty-six year old brother, forty-there year old brother, then the girls are, one's fifty-five and one's fifty-three and the other one I think is maybe fifty I don't know how old she is exactly and I can't think of it.  But no, see we didn't grow up together at all.  They lived in Orlando [Florida] and my dad remarried and moved to Orlando from St. Augustine [Florida] and so they were much younger and I stayed with mama [Susie Plummer Pooler].  They tell stories that I--that they ask me they wanted me to come live with them but I said, "No I was not leaving my grandmother," so which is probably right.  Even at that age I wasn't going anywhere.
Speaker 1: So who was in the household when you were growing up just you and your [paternal] grandmother?
Speaker 2: Me and my grandmother.  The sister cousin I talk about, Barbara [Barbara Richardson Johnson], would kind of come off and on.  Her mother, her parents were divorced and her mother remarried when I was about five I think and then Barbara kind of lived with them and then her mother died when I was about ten and then Barbara was kind of back with us off and on then she finished high school and stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's, she's the one I call my sister really even though we're first cousins, but she's closest to me as a sister than anybody else.
Speaker 1: I see okay.  Now--
Speaker 2: And I always say I was raised by a village though because I had Uncle Plummer [Andrew Plummer, Sr.] and Aunt Henrietta [Henrietta Williams Plummer] lived down the street around the corner and they had, well one of their daughters is about my age and they had three girls--three girls? Four girls and a boy [Andrew Plummer, Jr.] but they're much younger, but the two girls, the two oldest girls were like my sister cousins too because we all hung out together and you know did everything together really and then my aunt, my dad's brother lived in town so he, he and his family kind of helped.  You know they were always in my life too and then my dad's oth- older brother lived in Jacksonville [Florida].  So that was where we'd go spend like Easter we'd go there and summertime that was kind of like vacation a little bit to go into the big city (laughter).
Story_ID: 650209
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: (Pause) Yeah, I probably should be able to remember something before this time but I, I remember my--Barbara's [Barbara Richardson Johnson] mother who was my dad's sister Bernice [Bernice Pooler Webster], Bern married and I still used to call him Mr. Webster [James Webster], who became my uncle by marriage, he was the principal of the elementary school [West Augustine School No. 6, St. Augustine, Florida] and there was no kindergarten to go to at that time but because he was the principal, I was allowed to go to first grade when I was four years old.  I wasn't enrolled, but I could go to school because that was like kindergarten for me, which in a sense meant I repeated first grade, but he always said I was so smart and all this kind of stuff and he said, "Well there's no reason she can't just go."  I don't think I went every day but I can remember doing that very well.  I remember going to school with Barbara, she was older and I went to school with her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Even though--yep.
Story_ID: 650210
Speaker 1: So this is at St. Augustine [Florida]?  Was there a name for the neighborhood you lived in?
Speaker 2: Yes, it was called--well we just called it West Augustine [St. Augustine, Florida].  Actually it's Sai-, it's in the St. Johns County [Florida] I found out later, it's not really--the--our street, Live Oak Street was about a block long and the intersecting street was Whitney Street but that was also the county line.  So I actually lived in the county and the schools were in the country too.  They weren't even in the city.  St. Augustine is very, very small.
Speaker 1: It's the oldest city--yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oldest city in the nation, continuously occupied city in the nation.  And I just found out recently I, I really used to think it was all St. Augustine where I lived and everything too and I found out population of St. Augustine proper is only about thirteen thousand people.
Speaker 1: That is small.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, very small, very small but the county you know most of us lived in the county.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, so you called the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Well we just said West Augustine because--
Speaker 1: West Augustine.
Speaker 2: Yeah downtown was Lincolnville [St. Augustine, Florida] where black folks lived and then we lived in West Augustine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was across, well it wasn't across the railroad tracks yet.  Yeah it was across one set of railroad tracks (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was a kind of a rural setting or is it like a regular street?
Speaker 2: No, no it was a regular street although my little street, I take that back, my little street was actually a little dirt road when I was growing up.  It's been paved of course since then.  But it was a little hard packed dirt road.  The intersecting street as I think about it Whitney Street was paved because that's where we used to go play hopscotch and stuff and all with my cousins; but our, my little street was yeah, it was a dirt road.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dirt road, little shotgun house.
Story_ID: 650211
Speaker 1: We always ask this question.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of you growing up [in St. Augustine, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Sights and sounds and smells?  I could hear the railroad train--railroad train well the track wasn't too far away so I could hear the train.  Sights, I could see the train actually (laughter).  We lived, our street was up on a hill and as I said, we lived at the top of the hill and it was Barbara [Barbara Richardson Johnson] was there, I was there, there were some girls across the street from us and so when we got to be teenagers, actually it was called sugar hill because a lot of girls lived up there.  The people who lived across the street from me there was one family I know that was a, they were migrant workers and I know they would go and pick flowers and potatoes.  It seemed like potatoes.  So I can remember smelling them cooking the potatoes in the yard because it was a large family and they would like dig a hole and use coals and stuff and I can remember the smell of roast potatoes actually because that's how they cook 'em and I remember I always wanna go over there and taste them.  And Mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] would say no, I had to stay home.  So that's a smell I can remember.  I can remember Barbara's mother Bern [Bernice Pooler Webster] as she always smelled of powder to me.  I remember that very well.  My grandmother kind of smelled like powder too.  Bern always smelled like powder; and as a young woman I guess she was using a lot of powder (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But yeah.  So did we do sights, sounds and smells?
Story_ID: 650212
Speaker 1: Was church a big part of growing up?
Speaker 2: Church was a big part of growing up.  Yep.
Speaker 1: What--
Speaker 2: Mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] didn't have a car so we walked to church; and of course I used to say it was five miles but it probably was, it probably about a mile, about a mile from home.  Now Uncle Plummer [Andrew Plummer, Sr.] had a car but he didn't go--mama went to church early 'cause we had to go to Sunday school and Uncle Plummer would come later so we'd always get a ride home with him but we always walked to church.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: St. Luke A.M.E. Church [St. Augustine, Florida].  Yep and when I go back to visit them now I always go. Very small, mama was a stewardess and so she had to do the set up for communion and all that stuff and I used to kind of get to hang out back in the room with her and drink what I thought was wine but it was just grape juice.  But yeah and then summers were bible school.  Went to bible school during the summer.  Sunday school conventions.  You had during the summer as you got to be a teenager, you got to go to those to represent the church.  I didn't sing in the choir--well I did sing in the choir but my voice wasn't very good.  I was more of an usher; and then I always for Chil- Women's Day--Children's Day rather, I always had to be one of the speakers so that was my, my part there.
Story_ID: 650213
Speaker 1: You had a chance to go to school in the elementary school where your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --this would be your [paternal] uncle by--
Speaker 2: My uncle was the principal.
Speaker 1: Yeah by marriage was the, was the pri- principal (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right was the principal, right.
Speaker 1: And Mr. Webster?
Speaker 2: Mr. Webster.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Mr. James A. Webster [James Webster].
Speaker 1: --so what was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Okay I get a little confused here.  I always say, we always said West Augustine No. 6 School [sic. West Augustine School No. 6] and it was about a mile and a half maybe two miles to school we had to walk.  There was--when I went back here a few years ago, they had put a plaque in front of the, what used to be the school, it's no longer a school now.  But it had a plaque there and I think it said this time it was West Augustine No. 26--no No. 36 School for the Colored [ph.].  So that was like the original real name of it.  I can't remember it said when it was established and all that but I can't recall that right now.  I took a picture of that sign too.
Speaker 1: Okay. For the--School for the Colored?
Speaker 2: School for the Colored yeah.  I remember all my first--all my teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: I said I went to school when I was four when I just sat in and that was Ms. Sands [ph.].  Ms. Sands was a pretty teacher.  But when I went to go to school for first grade for real, I had a different teacher and that was Mrs. Murray [ph.] and she was an older teacher and second grade was Ms. Hill [ph.], third grade was Ms. Hale [ph.] and Ms. Hale had the dance class so that's when I kind of got into dance and stuff with her class, dancing and then I had Ms. Van [ph.] for fourth grade and I had Mr. Jackson [ph.] for fifth grade and Mr. Edwards [ph.] for sixth grade.  So I remember all my elementary school teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And some of--I can't remember who's still there, some of them are still living.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 650214
Speaker 1: Tell us about the village, you know.
Speaker 2: I, I used to--I always said I was raised by a village but I also used to say that that I was, that I was very blessed. And this is as I got older because it's almost like God said to me you know you're gonna have blessings all throughout your life because I gonna give you three, three mothers to raise you.  One to bring you into the world, and then Bern [Bernice Pooler Webster], my aunt who is my father's sister, was the second one and she was with me for the first ten years of my life along with my grandmother [Susie Plummer Pooler] and then mama was my grandmother who was the one who was gonna take me the rest of the way. And so when I think about it I always say--someone said to me recently, they commented how I looked or whatever and I just said, "It's all genetics."  I said, "I owe it all to, to my parents [Erma Lee Lofton Pooler and Eddie Pooler] and to my grandmother." And I say, "She's always the one up there looking down saying, 'Okay you can do this, you can do this, you can do this.'"  Because she always, she was, I figured out she was sixty something when I was born but she was very wise and she wasn't an old fuddy duddy grandmother you know.  She--I always had friends coming to the house, boys, girls, whomever, but she always said to me, "I have to trust you because I can't be with you all the time," which then led me to learn to trust myself and so that's one of the things I carry with her all the time.  She's with me. She's always here. And she actually visited me in 19--my father's never been to California, he's never visited me.  He doesn't know exactly how I live to be honest with you, but she came in 1972, 1972 my Uncle Webster [James Webster] of course is married to her daughter Bern, and Bern had passed away and so he really, and we'll get to that too later, he really helped me through college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] and all that kind of stuff but he always looked after mama after I was gone and so he came to visit and he said, "I'm bringing your grandmother," and so he did.  And so she had a chance to fly in 1972 came to visit me in my first house.
Speaker 1: Well this is
Speaker 2: This is really special.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's a big--
Speaker 2: Very, very, very special, very special.
Speaker 1: --it's really a
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --big event for, so.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, yep, yep, yep. I had to get that out (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay I'll be okay.
Story_ID: 650215
Speaker 1: All right so school--
Speaker 2: School.
Speaker 1: --West Augustine School No. 6 [St. Augustine, Florida] or No. 36 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) West Augustine School No. 6.
Speaker 1: --School for the Colored.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Exactly.
Speaker 1: Whichever one (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --but this school you named all your tea-, your grade school teachers but did you have any favorite teachers in school?
Speaker 2: My favorite teachers in, in school there was Mrs. Hale [ph.] who I mentioned earlier was the--she was a young teacher and so she had the dance club and, and the, the junior majorettes and all that kind of stuff and those were all things that I participated in and I think she played a big role in kind of helping us learn how to be in front of the public and stuff you know and, and that was a big part of it.  And then my second favorite teacher was my sixth grade teacher Mr. Edwards [ph.] who was a single gentlemen and actually as I look back on it now, he was gay but he always, he always--I don't know maybe it was more so with the girls in the class too, he just always, he always treated us like young ladies you know.  He called us by our last name.  I was Ms. Pooler [HistoryMaker Shirley Kinsey] you know.  He was always very respectful of us and made us be respectful of each other actually and that carried over into you know into adulthood and so I remember those two primarily.  There was one older teacher who was not my teacher, Mrs. Smith [ph.] that I got to know, though.  She was a fifth grade teacher but she wasn't my teacher but I got to know her very well and she was very much a lady. Smelled like powder too (laughter) but all I remember, her hair was always just you know perfectly done and she was--I don't think she had any kids either. But she just was always--even though we weren't in her class, she always kind of looked after us too, you know, just kind of gave us good advice, just; yeah, so they were all part of the village really.
Story_ID: 650216
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There was a, there was a school that was two blocks from my house that I could not go to because it was a school for white kids [Evelyn Hamblen Elementary School, St. Augustine, Florida] that I'll you that a bit later too (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Two blocks from your house?
Speaker 1: Two blocks from my house.
Speaker 2: But you had to go a mi- over a mile--
Speaker 1: Had to go over a mile, um-hm a mile to walk to school [West Augustine School No. 6, St. Augustine, Florida] and there was one little white boy that lived on my street and then there were white kids that lived around the corner, down the street and maybe about four houses from my cousins so we you know interacted and played when we were little, but you know, but of course as you got older you didn't and then you couldn't, couldn't go to school together.  But anyway--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) let's move on (laughter).
Story_ID: 650217
Speaker 1: Now did, did you have a favorite subject in school, in grade school [West Augustine School No. 6, St. Augustine, Florida]?
Speaker 2: I was always the, I was always the one who, who wrote, I was the writer.  I spoke a lot.  I saw something from our sixth grade class.  My high school class [from Richard J. Murray High School; R.J. Murray Middle School, St. Augustine, Florida], our class we still get together quite a bit and so someone had something from sixth grade and it said it listed what we all wanted to do when we grew up.  For some reason mine said I wanted to be a dancer.  I said, "I said that?"  But that's what was there.  But yeah.
Speaker 1: But what you write about?
Speaker 2: I write a little poetry.  I write--matter of fact I have a notebook that I, I still have from high school days and stuff and all. And I, I, just would, would write short stories, that kind of thing and nothing just for me basically.  I kept a diary, a journal; and I would have to write speeches when I had to you know make a presentation and stuff which meant I had to go read something else to find something to write about but yeah.
Story_ID: 650218
Speaker 1: Now what kind of literature were you exposed to in elementary school [West Augustine School No. 6, St. Augustine, Florida]?  Did they, did you, did you know about the black poets in?
Speaker 2: Not so much then, unh-uh.  I really didn't.  I really didn't.  I think more when I got go high school [Richard J. Murray High School; R.J. Murray Middle School, St. Augustine, Florida] or--although and then of course I didn't know it at the time that my [paternal] uncle knew Zora Neale Hurston.  I didn't find that out until much, much later.
Speaker 1: Your Uncle Webster [James Webster]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --knew Zora Neale Hurston?  Did--was he raised with her, or?
Speaker 2: No.  Well she actually spent time in St. Augustine [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My Uncle Webster actually taught art at the college there during the summer in St. Augustine.  The Florida Memorial College [Florida Normal and Industrial Memorial College; Florida Memorial University] was in St. Augustine at the time.  It's now in Miami [sic. Miami Gardens, Florida].  And so he taught art during the summer there and Ms. Hurston would be there during the summer and she kept a boat there on one of the rivers there and I think she either taught on campus or spoke or did something, but she would spend time there and there is, right now there's a plaque in front of her house that she used to live in when she would come there.  People put plaques all over town now (laughter).
Speaker 1: Now here, I have a note here that he knew Jacob Lawrence.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I didn't find that out until much later.  I have letters between--that Jacob Lawrence wrote to him.  He and Jacob Lawrence and his wife Gwen Knight [Gwendolyn Knight] and so when I think about you know what I'm doing now, it's almost like I kind of--I don't know, some of that's been channeled through what I'm doing now, through what we're doing now.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: He knew.  I have pictures with Sarah Vaughan with him that I found.  I think there's a Cab Calloway one down there I believe I have.
Speaker 1: He was actually friends with Jacob Lawrence and Zora Neale Hurston?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Was he friends with Sarah Vaughan too?
Speaker 2: Well I think so because I only have a picture though with them I should say but there are letters between Jacob and, and Zora, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Cab Calloway--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --used to come down there with--was there some sort of black entertainment spot in St. Augustine?
Speaker 2: Well no, I think I actually spent more time in Jacksonville [Florida] for entertainment purposes frankly you know.  No little juke joints around town in St. Augustine (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So he would travel too right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Used to send us postcards and things. And interesting enough now Barbara [Barbara Richardson Johnson], my sister who I call Barbara my sister, my cousin sister, he's her stepfather and so kind of had a hand in raising her also but he used to always say I was the one that was more like him. Like when I go to St. Augustine now, people say they think we're both his daughters you know they say, "Yeah Mr. Webster is your father, isn't he?"  "Well no he's my uncle."  Because, because of the travel and because our interest in art and stuff and all he used to say I was more like him than Barbara was. And so when that came about I think because, let's see Barbara went away to college and I was still there so I got a chance to be around him a little bit more you know as I was growing up and stuff too.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact he gave me away when I got married.
Speaker 1: He seems like a real dynamic person--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --did he go to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]?
Speaker 2: No, now he, he is from North Carolina originally.  He was the first male graduate of Winston-Salem Teachers College because it was a school for all women there now.  And I think that's Winston-Salem State [Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina] now.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah. But he was from--that's where he was from, Winston-Salem [North Carolina].  But he had all, you know like his house was all--he had art in the house there and he had you know his furniture was all very, very nice; and I used to like to go spend time out there.
Story_ID: 650219
Speaker 1: So these are all some good influences.  Now one of your teachers that--I guess high school [Richard J. Murray High School; R.J. Murray Middle School, St. Augustine, Florida] teacher (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) High school.
Speaker 1: --was Rosalie Gordon-Mills, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. Yep, yep.  She was my guidance counselor and my English teacher and played a big part in my life, frankly.  And I laugh about it now because after, after I was an adult and stuff and we used to joke and say well the kids always tease me and say I was her favorite anyway right, she had lots of favorites but I knew I was like her favorite, favorite (laughter). And so as I became an adult, I used to joke with her sometime and she said, "Yeah, you were my favorite."  Her daughter tells me that too. She says, "You were always my mom's favorite."  And I used to tell her daughter how envious I was of her, I said, "Because you got to have her as a mother."  Her daughter is much older than me.  And I saw her here a few years ago.  But Mrs. Gordon now, talk about a lady. She was married to the the first black dentist in town, Dr. Gordon [Rudolph Gordon], and then when he passed away, she married the only black pharmacist in town some years later. But she always, she drove a white Cadillac. And I was on--I was her star oratorical speaker, me and there was another a friend of mine, a guy, Wallace Lockett. And she would take us up and down the road in that white Cadillac from city to city to oratorical contests to speak. And then Wallace as he got older and got a driver's license, he was able to actually drive her car.  She had white carpet in her house.  I mean it's just and her street was Park Place, and I mean it was like no better street for her to have lived on (laughter) than Park Place.  She lived across town.  We lived on West Augustine [St. Augustine, Florida].  She was kind of like downtown right on the verge of kind of on the edge of where the black folks liked in town which was Lincolnville [St. Augustine, Florida] and then she was closer to like town, town so it was just close to where white folks lived.  But was very, very instrumental in me going to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], helped me get a scholarship there and actually took me to visit colleges and stuff and she used to tell me, I remember she took me once to visit my grand- not my grandfather, what am I saying here--my dad [Eddie Pooler] in Orlando [Florida] because I was speaking there and she took me by to see him and she used to remind me that I cried and cried because I kind of wanted to stay with them but then I knew I was going back to mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] and she said she told my dad she said, "Oh no, I can't leave her.  I promised her grandmother that I was gonna bring her home.  I can't leave her."  She said, "You just cried."  I said, "Yeah, yeah I was torn between you know that kind of stuff back then." But she was, she was yeah and she actually visited me too in 1981 I was living in San Clemente, California, and she was visiting us somewhere in San Diego [California] and so she took the train and I picked her up and she came to visit me in Sacramento [California], which was another very special thing because all of a sudden here was somebody from my, who had a part in my growing up and becoming who I am and here she is getting to see how I live you know what I mean? Because the house we had in San Clemente was huge. And so it was like I just wanted to make her proud you know.  And I wanted her to see that I had done well and so it was very special, very special.  Her ninetieth birthday I was invited to come back and be one of the speakers (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) San Clemente isn't that where Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] had a place?
Speaker 2: Yes, not Reagan, Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 1: Nixon okay.
Speaker 2: Nixon, Nixon, Nixon, Nixon White House, yeah.  Actually the house, interesting enough, the house we had supposedly--he had looked at the house but I think they couldn't get a helicopter in there they said because it was on a huge property, 1940s house, and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: That was--yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--
Speaker 2: That's another story too (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) We'll get to that later.
Story_ID: 650220
Speaker 1: When you were growing up what were the public accommodations like in that area for black folks?  Was there like--I know St. Augustine [Florida] had a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --intense civil rights struggle there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came too when I was in Augustine in 1960, I think he came in 1962 actually.  I know he was there the summer of 1963 because my [paternal] grandmother [Susie Plummer Pooler] sent me away.  By that time you know things were happening and she was afraid for me and sent me to North Carolina to go stay with my sister [Kinsey's cousin, Barbara Richardson Johnson] who was still in school at the time.
Speaker 1: Is that when you went to the Excelsior elementary school [Excelsior School, St. Augustine, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Well Excelsior--let's back up here a little bit here on that.  Excelsior was seventh grade, like a seventh grade center.  West Augustine [West Augustine School No. 6, St. Augustine, Florida] only went to sixth grade.  Excelsior had been a full school from first through twelfth grade but in 1958 I think is--no '55 [1955] I guess, they built a high school and so but those of us in West Augustine had to go--but high school didn't start 'til eighth grade so we had to be bussed across town to go to a seventh grade school and that was where, that was where Excelsior came in.  Now my teacher there was really interesting too, it's Mr. Larkins, Frank Larkins.  He was--I used to always have problems with the--I had girlfriends but my best friends were always kind of guys and so going to a new school with kids who'd gone to school together all their lives here we were coming from the west side coming to their school and so the girls there kind of picked on us a little bit because we--I guess we were sort of country to them a little bit because we lived out west and we lived over town and all that stuff. And so I used to always have problems with the new girls over there and so he used to tell me he said, "Don't worry about that," he says "Your best friends are guys, a girl's best friend is a guy."  He said, "Girls tell your business to each other, they get mad with you and your stuff's all in the street."  He says, "Guys don't do that."  And sure enough my best friends to this day basically have been guys.  So he was kind of--played a little role in there too.
Story_ID: 650221
Speaker 1: But after seventh grade [at Excelsior School, St. Augustine, Florida], I went to eighth grade and then that was high school.  So I went to high school eighth through twelfth grade.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that was Richard J. Murray High School [R.J. Murray Middle School, St. Augustine, Florida].
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: He was the--school was the--as I look back on it now, things were--I'm gonna back up just a little bit here.  Nineteen sixty [1960] now, well 1960 West Augustine School [West Augustine School No. 6, St. Augustine, Florida] was no more and they built a new school and it was named after my [paternal] uncle, so it's James A. Webster Elementary School [sic. Webster Elementary School; The Webster School, St. Augustine, Florida].  It still exists it's one of the better schools in the city now, but then Murray High School was named after the principal also who was, he was the principal and the school was named after him which was a little unheard of when I think about it.  You know but it still was a school for black kids and it was further west.  It was far enough west that we had to take the school bus then, we couldn't walk to that school.  So it was farther than my elementary school.  It was closer to the college.  Florida Memorial [Florida Normal and Industrial Memorial College; Florida Memorial University] was maybe half a mile from (background noise)--oh that's right--it was a half a--Florida Memorial was a half a mile from my high school, so you kind of interacted with some college kids and, you know as you got older and stuff there too which was kind of interesting.
Story_ID: 650222
Speaker 1: But when you were in--so when you were growing up you kind of stayed away from situations where there'd be some kind of segregational conflict (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.  I graduated in 1963 and things were beginning to kind of happen a little bit.  We would--mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] used to tell us if they want you to sit on back of the bus then you don't ride the bus, basically. And you know growing up on the west side particularly, it was more of a black neighborhood [West Augustine, St. Augustine, Florida].  You hung with you know folks in the neighborhood, the people from the church you know you kind of did all that stuff.  I remember wanting to go to a little hamburger place or whatever and you had to go to the window to get, you couldn't go inside you had to go to the window and mama would say, "No, then you just don't go there," you know.  And we actually--if we wanted to go downtown, we would either walk downtown or Uncle Plummer [Andrew Plummer, Sr.] would take us.  As we got older, early teenagers I remember we decided we were gonna catch the bus but what we would do is we would get on the bus and ride it as far as we could without sitting in the back until--if more--because they would--the driver wouldn't necessarily tell you anything, but if more people got on the bus, then they'd would want you to move.  We stayed on the bus until more people got on there and then we just got off then you know and I remember we would try and speak what I thought at the time was pig Latin but I didn't--we didn't know what we were saying, but we try and make sound like we were speaking some foreign language (laughter) so they wouldn't know we were black.  You know they think we were from some other country or something or whatever.  I do remember that.  But I remember walking to town, carrying my umbrella because it was hot in the summertime and so we would walk downtown.  There were places, there was one store particularly that some Armenian people owned, it was a jewelry store. And now they knew that we didn't have money to come in there and buy anything but they would let us come in and look and try on jewelry actually, we could try on bracelets and stuff and all.  But most of the stores who were owned by white people you couldn't try on anything.  Mama had--there was one store there as I think about it I can remember what those people were, but mama had an account there.  It was the only store in town where we could go and we could try on shoes or clothes.  The rest of the time you couldn't.  You could buy it and if it was too big you know, too bad.  Mama, mama actually--I, I laugh because I said I don't think I had a brand new dress until I got to high school [Richard J. Murray High School; R.J. Murray Middle School, St. Augustine, Florida], no until I got to--I think my prom dress I know was new.  My senior prom dress was. But mama made all my clothes and I learned to sew and so we made them.  You know she made a lot of our clothes.  She kind of sewed for the neighborhood and the rest of the family and stuff and all and we just didn't--I had an aunt who worked in New York [New York] who used to send I know hand me downs down you know and mama would alter them and do whatever she needed to do to them and that was what we wore.
Story_ID: 650223
Speaker 1: So in high school now you were--you graduated as valedictorian, but--
Speaker 2: I was valedictorian of my class (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) were you involved in a lot of activities in high school [Richard J. Murray High School; R.J. Murray Middle School, St. Augustine, Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had mentioned as we talked about Mrs. Gordon [Rosalie Gordon-Mills] a little earlier and she was my high school guidance counselor so I didn't meet her until, well when I went to high school in the eighth grade that's when I actually met her.  I was head majorette for two years which was a little unheard of too because you're not supposed to do that until you were a senior but I did it junior and senior year.  I was president student council, I was president of the Tri-Hi-Y, I was on the dance team.  I was like lead dancer for the dance team.  I didn't play sports at all.  I couldn't--I wasn't that good (laughter) for that.  I actually, my senior year I wanted to run for campus queen to be Miss Murray High and my high school principal, Mr. Murray [Richard J. Murray] bless his heart, said to me, "Ms. Pooler [HistoryMaker Shirley Kinsey] you're doing everything. Would you please let somebody else do something?"  And I remember I was so hurt because I said (makes sound) so anyway. So I never--I waited for college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] for that part.  But anyway yeah. High school, high school was good.  I had two, two things that happened in high school that wasn't as much life changing for me but for two of my friends who are still my friends actually. Tenth grade my two best friends that I'd known since grade school and lived down the street and around the corner from, they used to actually walk me home and we'd come from football games and they would--we'd get off the bus and they'd walk me home, drop me off and then they could go together to their house because they lived across the street from each other and in--we were in tenth grade and we had little boyfriends here and there but they were in tenth grade, we were in tenth grade and they had senior boyfriends and they both got pregnant.  Not only that they both got pregnant and they both had girls an hour apart.  So now here my best girlfriends that I'd grown up with you know remember I said I didn't make new good girlfriends along the way so they were gone.  Mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] I had said was older but was also progressive said to me, you know 'cause you know back in those days if you got pregnant, you had to go to night school or you didn't finish school and you couldn't hang out with your friends and all that kind of stuff, but mama said, you know, "You've known them all your life, you loved them, they were your friends then, they did wrong, you don't follow and do what they did, but they're still your friends."  And so we never stopped being friends and which to this day I treasure because we're still, we see each other still now you know.  One of them, Rosalie [Rosalie Sapp], her daughter [R. LaChanze Sapp] went on to become an actress and won a Tony [Antoinette Perry Award for Excellence in Theatre] for 'The Color Purple' being Miss Celie in--on Broadway and that's the child that she had when we were in high school.  So, the, the, you know just that whole thing just kind of goes around.  But but that was a big one for me.  'Cause that was the big one that I had to kind of get my arms around and get ready for because all of a sudden you know because we talked about always going to college together, doing all these things and then they were gone.  One got, well they both no one of them got married then.  Rosalie got married, the other one didn't.  But--
Speaker 1: Did it make you more cautious then? Just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah and but that's when, that's when what mama had said to me about trusting me really kicked in you know too it was like okay you out here by yourself.  I, I grew closer to my guy friends, my--I had one friend Robert [ph.] who is like my big brother that mama trusted enormously.  He had a car and mama would let me go anywhere with him (laughter).  If he played basketball and if he was gonna drive to Jacksonville [Florida] to the basketball tournament and I wanted to go, and I could go and stay with my aunt over there, she would let me go.  She would write a note and say, "Shirley is," you know, "gonna leave school early today. She's gonna go," and she let me go.  And to this day I'm still very good friends with him and now he ultimately married my cousin too, so he's like my brother cousin now but yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that was, that was a big one.  That was like okay.  And so which also meant then I was the only one of my friends who actually went away to college.
Story_ID: 650224
Speaker 1: A lot of my friends went to school in St. Augustine [Florida] because there was a college there, but--and some went to Bethune-Cookman College [Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida].  One went to Bethune-Cookman but I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Which is the one in St. Augustine?
Speaker 1: It was Florida Memorial College [Florida Memorial University].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Florida--it was Florida Normal Memorial College, it's now Florida Memorial in--it's in Miami [sic. Miami Gardens, Florida]. Yeah. But then I was the only one that went to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] me and--
Speaker 2: Now how did you choose Florida A and M?
Speaker 1: Mrs. Gordon [Rosalie Gordon-Mills] bless her heart, was determined that I was gonna be a pharmacist (laughter) and FAMU had a school of pharmacy. And that's what my scholarship was in actually, and so that's how I went there on scholarship.  She took me there the summer before, introduced me to her friends who lived off campus, her--but so I had kind of like a resident family in town you know when I went to school there.  Even though I stayed on campus there was still somebody where I can go and visit and talk on weekends and that kind of stuff.  So she made sure I had--'cause she'd grown up in, in Tallahassee [Florida] actually and she'd gone to Florida A and M and so that's how I would up going there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep, yep.
Speaker 2: Okay, as a pharmacy major you're taking like--
Speaker 1: I'm taking math, I'm taking chemistry, I'm taking qualitative analysis, I'm taking quantitative analysis, I'm taking zoology and biology, and my grades are terrible (laughter). So anyway I eventually changed my major and majored in English.
Speaker 2: Okay so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's where my love was really.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause you're writing and--
Speaker 1: Yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: But you know in Ms. Gordon's mind I was gonna be this black female pharmacist, (laughter) and so.
Speaker 2: Did you have a favorite writer when you were in college?
Speaker 1: Zora Neale Hurston is my favorite now and of course Dr. Maya Angelou [HistoryMaker Maya Angelou] but I didn't really know them that well then.  Who did I like in school?  Interestingly enough I majored in English, I loved--you're gonna laugh at this--I liked Chaucer [Geoffrey Chaucer] back then.  It was, it was old English because it was fun to try and read that and kind of figure out--I liked Shakespeare [William Shakespeare] back then you know.  I really did.
Speaker 2: This is 13th century [sic.] writing?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Which was kind of interesting though.  Also now at Florida A and M we didn't really get--it's 1963, 1967, we didn't in English classes and stuff didn't have, we still were not studying about you know black writers.  I can't remember when maybe Baldwin [James Baldwin] started writing I can't remember.  I remember learning about James Weldon Johnson because he wrote you know Negro National Anthem ['Lift Every Voice and Sing'] and I remember knowing about--and also I liked his work too because there's--I have a little book by him, 'God's Trombone' [sic. 'God's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse'] (makes sound) (unclear) yeah.
Story_ID: 650225
Speaker 1: This is a time when a lot of change--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the black--'63 [1963] to '67 [1967]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-three [1963].  Well '63 [1963] was--
Speaker 1: A lot of--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-two [1962]--
Speaker 2: Sixty-six [1966]--'63 [1963] was the year I graduated [from Richard J. Murray High School; R.J. Murray Middle School, St. Augustine, Florida] and I said--Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] had been to town but mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] sent me to North Carolina with my sister  because she didn't want me to be around because she was scared frankly because folks were getting hurt you know and killed really and so I went to college like late August of '63 [1963] and had in my mind felt like I had missed the Civil Rights Movement, 'cause it--
Speaker 1: So you went from North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well I went back home--
Speaker 1: Back home (simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) to you know pack and all that kind of stuff but yeah. But, but I worked in North Carolina that summer plus I needed a job.  But by the time I got to school then I felt like I had missed you know what was going on civil rights wise.  You don't think it's gonna last for years and--
Speaker 1: This is Medgar Evers is assassinated?
Speaker 2: Yep, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: March on Washington (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) March on Washington.
Speaker 1: Birmingham [Alabama] bombing.
Speaker 2: Actually Barbara's [Barbara Richardson Johnson] birthday was the same day as the March on Washington, August 28, I remember that and so I--by the time I got to school and things were happening there, CORE [Congress of Racial Equality] and SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] were on campus [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] so as soon as you know, meetings are being held and time to go march; I was in that.  So that's how kind of how I would up getting arrested.
Speaker 1: Oh okay well tell us what--is this--
Speaker 2: Which is another kind of life changing moment too.
Story_ID: 650226
Speaker 1: Okay so you were saying off camera that when the March on Washington was going on on August 28th you were probably in Tallahassee [Florida]?
Speaker 2: Yeah I had to be in Tallahassee I'm pretty sure because I--school usually started about the third week of August at least two weeks before--yeah, about two weeks before September, before Labor Day you'd be at school so I would have been in school during that time. And then shortly after that I think I was arrested.  I think I was arrested--I think we were arrested like September 12th somewhere in there.
Speaker 1: Of your freshmen year?
Speaker 2: My freshmen year um-hm.
Speaker 1: You got involved quick?
Speaker 2: I got involved yeah quick as soon as I got to school in fact.
Speaker 1: Well tell us the story.  What kind of demonstration were you involved (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well we were demonstrating--and it seems frivolous now--we were wanted to sit at the lunch counters at Woolworth's [F.W. Woolworth Company] and when we got arrested we were trying to integrate the State Street Theater [sic. State Theatre]. And Tallahassee being the capital of Florida you know it's pretty big stuff there.  St. Augustine [Florida] and Tallahassee were really like hotbeds in Florida for trying to integrate services and stuff.  Because in the theater you had to sit--you had to go through the back door and you had to sit upstairs.  Okay, and you never had the ripe popcorn.  It was always stale and the candy stuff is always stale and you didn't wanna sit there you wanted to be able to sit where you wanted to sit.  And so we were trying to integrate the theaters and that's when we actually got arrested.
Speaker 1: So how many--what was the name of the organization?  Who was the leader and how many of you all were in it?
Speaker 2: It was, it was CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], it was CORE and the leader at that time I remember name very well.  I have a book written by her.  [HistoryMaker] Patricia Stephens Due was her name. She was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Patricia.
Speaker 2: Stephens Due, D-U-E.  She passed away not too long ago.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Her daughter lives out here.  Her daughter is Tananarive Due who is a writer.
Speaker 1: Writer, right, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm yeah, that's her daughter, yep, yep good so you know her.
Speaker 1: Tananarive Due yeah.
Speaker 2: Tananarive yeah. And matter of fact I think Tanana- Tananarive was born down there. Yeah, she was and Patricia was, she was it was her senior year and she was a forceful woman, and I mean just very, very outspoken and she was the leader. She's I think she's president or at least the leader of our circle of us going, going to march (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) In that chapter of CORE?
Speaker 2: --um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we literally--I must admit it wasn't--it was scary but it wasn't, I mean it wasn't like the dogs and hoses and stuff were out there at that time.  Now those--I missed doing the stuff at the Woolworth's counter.  That was a little bit more face to face with people you know trying to sit at the counters and stuff so that was a little more--they're in your face then and you know intimidation and stuff.  So this was when we were basically marching carrying protest signs and all that kind of stuff and of course they said they were gonna fill the jails up with us and so they came and start taking folks and very few freshmen, my best friend from college [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] wound up being--we had not even met, I don't think we met there and she was a New York girl but her parents had grown up in the South and so she was you know there protesting too.  And we were--we spent three days in jail.  It wasn't really--we went to jail but it was so many of us until they moved us out to what was like work camps which was kind of scary. Because--
Speaker 1: About how many were (unclear)?
Speaker 2: There were like I think there was close to three hundred of us I think and Tallahassee's--even though it's the capital it's still a small town you know and that was in that group and I think the next day more were arrested.  I can't recall what that was you know 'cause, 'cause protesters kept coming, we just kept saying they were gonna fill up the jails.  So they took the males they took out to like the county, county fairgrounds and the women once the jails were overflowing, they took us to where men were housed and work camps, so they were like these--it wasn't jail exactly were like these--
Speaker 1: Barracks?
Speaker 2: --barracks, yeah, yeah with like you know cots lined up and stuff and all and we were there actually for three days and I used to always say I remember I had to throw away the cutest little outfit 'cause you got dressed up to go down there. You know, you couldn't just go looking any kind of way and and you didn't have clothes, you slept in those clothes.  I remember it was getting a little chilly and we would take--and we were nervous because the men were you know within I'll say the next barrack may have been five feet away and so it was no curtains on the window so we took the sheets off the beds and you know tried to hang them to the window so the men couldn't look in there and then we literally I remember Madie Sailor [ph.] is her name, she and I actually shared a cot 'cause we had taken the sheet off her bed, and--to use for windows so we needed something to cover up with because we was getting cold and then the groups, supportive groups from campus were the ones who kind of you know collected toothbrushes and stuff for us and toiletries and all that kind of stuff.  But then they weren't allowed to get them to us right away you know.  But once they were able to get through some of the systems and stuff all they allowed them to bring is to us I think that Sunday they were able to bring stuff to us and so at least you had something to be able to get some semblance of, of you know--
Speaker 1: Jail didn't provide any of that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 650227
Speaker 1: And then we were released on our own recognizance, I remember.  I was seventeen, and those of us I think who were under eighteen weren't, we weren't fined at all 'cause we were underage; but I remember, Patricia [HistoryMaker Patricia Stephens Due] I believe got suspended that year.  She stayed in jail longer I know because she had been arrested before in like the spring before because she led a group and everything and this was our first time.  I remember my--I said my mother [Erma Lee Lofton Pooler] had a sister Aunt Rosa [Rosalie Lofton Williams]. Lake City [Florida] was only like sixty miles from Tallahassee [Florida] so my Uncle Louis [Louis Williams], my Aunt Rosa's husband, came to Tallahassee to see you know what she could do for me if I need--I didn't let my [paternal] grandmother [Susie Plummer Pooler] know right away.  I was scared.  I thought I was gonna lose my scholarship you know all that kind of stuff and--
Speaker 2: So how did the administration [at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] take i- take it?
Speaker 1: Well they put us on probation.  I remember we were on probation I know that whole semester and if we, if we were to engage in protesting again and got arrested again, we could get suspended from school you know, there. Dr. Gore [George W. Gore, Jr.] was president at the time and I remember his statements about you know we--there were ways to do this and we weren't doing it the correct way or something or whatever you know blah, blah, blah. Let things take its course and all this kind of stuff and of course students were not hearing that.  I remember the guy who was president of our student body was, he was suspended I remember he was suspended because he was very much in, in, in meetings and stuff talking about how we need to do this and all this stuff. And interestingly enough Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey], my husband's brother [Bradshaw Kinsey], was vice president.  He became president of the student, student government after that um-hm and Prince McIntosh was the other guy's name.  Yeah he got suspended or expelled even.  I don't think Patricia even was able to come back to school.  I don't believe.  I think she was suspended.  And I remember the next semester I think she was supposed to do a student teaching and I think she said they came to her classroom when she was student teaching and took her out the class.  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: So she had to finish someplace else?
Speaker 1: Um-hm I'm pretty sure that's what she did yeah.
Speaker 2: Now this is--
Speaker 1: She moved back down that way too after they left they left town and they moved back down there a few years ago, quite a few years ago, she and her husband [John Due].  Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Similar situation so how many people got suspended, do you think?
Speaker 1: You know what I don't remember.  I really don't. And I, I, I've even tried to find my record actually because I remember when I graduated and moved to California I kept thinking, gosh am I gonna be able to find a job, they took my fingerprints and everything you know.  'Cause they asked you know have you ever been arrested but of course for that reason you know they didn't, they didn't that wasn't a problem at all.  But it was scary, it was quite you--as a seventeen year old and even though you knew people were--you never think it's gonna happen to you that's the thing.  You know you're out doing this you think you're not gonna be the one that gets--you know; and then you do.
Story_ID: 650228
Speaker 1: Now you joined Delta Sigma Theta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm.  Can I go back on that just a little bit, though (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: During that time after getting out of jail and everything and going through probation and all is actually when I met Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey], my husband.  Bernard was part of that group that was collecting toiletries and all that stuff for, for us and he was an upperclassmen and so he was part of the group also that was trying to kind of help us understand what our responsibilities were and what, what's, what you know being on probation meant and you know kind of how to make that work for you actually.  We had to sign in every time you left somewhere, you had to sign in and sign back in all that of stuff and so that's actually when we met shortly after that and started dating in November.  And the rest is history (laughter).
Speaker 1: So you're still a freshmen at that point?
Speaker 2: I was still a freshmen yeah, he was a junior, he was a junior, I was a freshmen.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Seventeen year old freshmen (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right so, so and he was majoring in, in what?
Speaker 2: He was a math major.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah and interestingly enough I talked about my, my pharmacy major and I tease him some time now, I say the reason my grades dropped is because he start going to lab with me.  Saying, "I can go help you with this.  I took qualitative analysis.  I can help you with your lab work."  And I got a D in the course that semester (laughter).  But anyway.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So but you all, you all don't get married until after college right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we dated all through college, yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He waited for me (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He was gone though in two years right? He was--
Speaker 2: No, he waited for me.  He graduated one semester ahead of me [from Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 650229
Speaker 1: Now I know--William (pronunciation) Eaton [sic. HistoryMaker James N. Eaton, Sr.] right?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Eaton?
Speaker 2: Eaton.
Speaker 1: Eaton.
Speaker 2: It's Eaton yeah.
Speaker 1: Like William Eton.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He, he was the E-A-T-O-N--
Speaker 2: Uh-huh
Speaker 1: --he was a big influence on [HistoryMaker] Bernard Kinsey, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, yes he was because he started the black archives on campus at Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida]. He was a history teacher and so I never had him as a teacher. I don't think I even got to meet him until, until later.  I really don't remember being in his presence at all.  But he was Bernard's history teacher and I think Bernard--you know how you wanna sit at the foot of the master so to speak and just listen to them talk?  Well that was kind of what it was, what it was like for him, just to listen to him describe things because he had been to Africa and you know places and stuff knew all this stuff and was a big, big impetus for him.  Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yep, yep, yep.
Story_ID: 650230
Speaker 1: Did you have a sense of--I mean considering what you would do later on in life, did Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in general give you a sense of history and--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah. I was not--but again, history, you know you're taking American history, you're taking world history, you're taking--to me it was almost like you learning about all the cultures and stuff other than your own in a sense you know.  You're living your stuff right there but you weren't really learning a lot about other cultures, I mean about your own culture.  I--1965 yeah. I--the summer of 1965 I went back home and was able to get a job at my uncle's school, Webster School [Webster Elementary School; The Webster School, St. Augustine, Florida], it was the year of Head Start so that was kind of first year I think that I really got somewhat involved with African American history in a sense because now you're working with little kids and you kind of wanna help them understand a little bit about themselves and stuff. And the next year interestingly enough the summer of '66 [1966] I went back to work that summer at Evelyn Hamblen School [Evelyn Hamblen Elementary School, St. Augustine, Florida], which was the school two blocks from where I grew up, where I couldn't go to school there.  So now 1966, I'm able to get a job there during the summer working with Head Start.
Speaker 1: Were you the first black teacher there?
Speaker 2: Um-hm, um-hm, um-hm, um-hm.  So that was--well I wasn't a teacher, teacher I was--
Speaker 1: Head Start teacher?
Speaker 2: --well yeah, Head Start teacher, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep, which was quite interesting and I used to say you know I could just walk to work right here.  Couldn't walk to go to school there but I could walk to go to work.  I met someone here recently who said to me that her mother had taught school, a white girl, told my mother had taught school there.  She said, "Oh you might have known my mom," and I said, "No honey think about it now, (laughter) back then I would not have known her.  She wouldn't have known me either," but yeah, that was always kind of interesting (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 650231
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who were some of the other people who were in school with you?
Speaker 2: When I was in college?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Bob Hayes was in school when I was there.  He was ahead of me but you know he was the fastest man in the world at one point.
Speaker 1: Right.  Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He's from Jacksonville [Florida].  He was in college with me then.  Let me see who else was there?  Of notice you mean? Of--
Speaker 1: Yeah, well just the flavor of the school, 'cause I don't--yeah Bob Hayes, world's fastest human.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: There's another fella there who was a great athlete too and I can't think of his name.
Speaker 2: A lot, a lot of football players used to come out and go pro, there was Al Denson went, there was Hubert Ginn went.  I think they were with the Raiders [Oakland Raiders].  Denson played for Denver [Denver Broncos] for Broncos, Cowboys [sic.].  What else?  This is terrible.  I can't remember.  I can't remember all the names.  I didn't hang out with the football players that much.
Speaker 1: And then you had the marching band (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I remember the marching band now.  That was--yeah.
Speaker 1: Who was the director?
Speaker 2: Mr. Foster, Dr. Foster [HistoryMaker William Foster].
Speaker 1: Dr. Foster.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a very big influence on Bernard's life actually because Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] played in the band. And so he was really big yeah, big influence and actually I didn't even know Dr. Foster that much at school because he was, as a student he's bigger than life you know but as--after we were married and moved out to California and we'd go back for homecoming and stuff and I was always able to kind of be around him.  Now his wife I knew.  She had been a good friend of Bernard's mother [Christine Kinsey] when they were in college together and so I got to know her when I was in school.  She--actually I worked in kind of an office where she was for a while there.  Bernard's parents went to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] too you know.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So family tradition
Speaker 2: Yeah um-hm.
Speaker 1: And there's something about that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And his brother [Bradshaw Kinsey] and sister-in-law [Penelope Kinsey] met there too.
Speaker 1: The live oak there was--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: --planted during the emancipation, there's some kind of story about the live oak on campus at the entrance?
Speaker 2: That tree, that big tree that's out there with the moss and stuff and all?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You know what I can't remember what that story now is anyway.
Speaker 1: I think it dates back to emancipation day or something?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But they--
Speaker 2: I'm terrible.  I cannot remember.
Speaker 1: ---freed slaves had the proclamation [Emancipation Proclamation] was read there or something in front of that live oak or something.
Speaker 2: Okay.  That could very well be.  I, I wish I could--drawing a blank on that there.  I had mentioned earlier about in St. Augustine [Florida] that Dr. not Dr. but that Frederick Douglass actually spoke I found out a few years ago in St. Augustine and they put a plaque there to where he spoke and everything.  They said he had seven hundred people there when he spoke. And he only came for the afternoon, spoke and took the train back to Jacksonville and left from there--never came back again.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Story_ID: 650232
Speaker 1: All right well, well at any rate you, you change your major to English and--
Speaker 2: Um-hm changed my major to English (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) were there any special teachers in that department?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was Mrs.--oh darn, what is her name?  Her husband was one of the football coaches.  Oh shoot I can see her face just as clear.  It wasn't Mrs. Tookes.  Oh dear, this is terrible can't remember her name.  This is awful.  I'm gonna tell you somebody who was a a big influence on me there though, who was not an English teacher, but who taught journalism because I really think I would have majored in journalism, had, had a journalism major at that time, but they didn't.  They have a huge journalism school now and that was Thelma T. Gorham [Thelma Thurston Gorham] and she was, she was very good, very good.  I used to talk to her quite a bit.
Speaker 1: Thelma T. Gorham.
Speaker 2: Thelma T. Gorham.  Matter of fact 'cause school I believe is either named after her or there's a department named after her or something there on campus. School of journalism.  And interestingly enough I've had two nieces to come through that school.
Speaker 1: All right.  So Florida A--
Speaker 2: Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] you know it was a big, big part of my life, frankly you know best friends made there, other than the two good high school friends, but--
Speaker 1: Okay so--
Speaker 2: --lifetime friends.
Speaker 1: --I guess you took the English education or something like, right (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Um-hm, yep, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: However I wound up teaching elementary ed when I moved to California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 650233
Speaker 1: You and Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] get married in '67 [1967]?
Speaker 2: We got married 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I--I'm trying to work through the years there. Okay freshmen year we met, sophomore year we dated, although it might have been a little bit more than just dating.  Bernard would always go away during the summer to work.  He went to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] I think the summer of '65 [1965] worked there and we actually, interestingly enough we actually started saving money when we were dating.  He would--we went to D.C. that summer he worked at one of the [U.S.] Senate buildings or something like that. And, and then he also was a lifeguard at the local pool and so he had two jobs.  So he would send me one check and tell me to open up an account and it was in my name actually but it was to save, save money.  And then the summer of '66 [1966] was the summer he actually went to the Grand Canyon [Arizona] and he was a park ranger, the first black park ranger at the Grand Canyon and same thing he send me part of his check and tell me save it.  Bought my ring that summer of '65 [1965] actually, beca- we got engaged and he would I remember he bought the whole set the wedding band and the engagement ring.  I said, "Well I don't need all these."  He said, "No you just keep the whole thing until we get married," and that's literally how he proposed I think.  I don't think he really asked me to marry him but we'd always talked about you know when we get married kind of thing.  And then he graduated December '66 [1966] and I was still in school.  I had a semester to go and we decided we would get married because he had gotten a job offer and moved to California.  We'd always thought--L.A. for us was lovely Atlanta [Georgia] and that's where all our friends are basically going.  That was the big city and so that was where we thought we always wanted to go but when he got this job offer, they, they, they didn't tell him this in words but literally they meant that you would not make it in this job in the South.  Bernard, if you know him, he's always been outspoken and everything.  They just said, "No, no, no.  We have a job for you in California.  We're not offering you a job in Atlanta.  We're offering you a job in California.  That's where we need you," and that's, that's how we wound up coming to California actually.
Speaker 1: Okay so he was working for Xerox [Xerox Corporation]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Well actually that was Humble Oil Company [Humble Oil and Refining Company; Exxon Company, U.S.A.].
Speaker 1: Humble Oil first--
Speaker 2: Humble Oil Company, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Humble Oil first.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay so and you come along?
Speaker 2: Yep we got married that February.  I turned twenty-one on my birthday, February 7th.  Mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] had said yes but she lived in St. Augustine [Florida] and she would have had to sign for me you know if I got married before that time.  And my--I pledged Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] in '65 [1965].  So my sorority sisters helped me with my wedding.  The guidance counselor, college guidance counselor also was a minister and had a church so he married us.  He was one who helped Bernard get the job and then I had been my junior year I had been miss junior attendant and so I had to wear white coronation gown so one of my sorority sisters made a lace jacket for me to wear over my coronation gown because we were saving money.  We weren't buying wedding gowns and stuff. And that's what we did.  That's what we did.  We got married.  Our reception was on campus [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] in the student union building, they allowed us to use the student union building and we invited friends and stuff.  It was a big wedding because everybody was there but it was a bi- small wedding from the standpoint.  My sister [Kinsey's cousin, Barbara Richardson Johnson] was my maid of honor, my Delta advisor's daughter was the flower girl and Bernard's best friend was our best man.  So the wedding party was small, but the gathering was fairly large.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was 1967.
Story_ID: 650234
Speaker 1: So he's already out in California wor- working for Humble Oil [Humble Oil and Refining Company; Exxon Company, U.S.A.] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Working, yep.
Speaker 1: --when you come out?
Speaker 2: When I came, and I came out for spring break (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And did you have a job already lined up?
Speaker 2: Nope.  I came for spring break, had never, ever--I had flown once before but that was only the second time I'd flown, never flown that distance.  And I had never seen such wide streets.  You know because L.A. [Los Angeles, California] was huge and I did not drive at all.  I hadn't learned to drive because mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] didn't have a car.  You know in St. Augustine [Florida] you walked or your uncle took you everywhere.  So I moved out here and he, he--I moved in June. By that time he found an apartment and he'd run into a, a gentlemen from who had gone to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] who is a football player who came out here and played for the Rams [Los Angeles Rams].  Tex we called him, Washington, Paul Washington [ph.] was his name and Paul was no longer playing football any more but he was teaching school in Compton.  He's a coach, football coach in Compton and Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] wound up moving in the same apartment building with him so he had an apartment and everything. And I got here of course didn't have a job.  That September Paul said, "Don't worry about it, you can substitute teach in Compton," and that's what I wound up doing.  And that's how I got in elementary ed because my major was English but I start substituting in, in Compton, third grade, and it was--interestingly enough the school was--elementary school was right next to where the high school was.  I didn't drive but I could go to work with Paul in the morning.  He would drive to school and so I'd ride with him.  Bernard worked for Humble Oil Company and he had, he had young people who worked for him at the stations and stuff so sometimes one of them would pick me up to bring me back home until I met teachers who lived in the area and that kind of stuff and then I eventually learned to drive obviously.  But I was a long term substitute teacher the first semester.  Second semester also and then by the next year, I was offered long time term contract and then I had to go back to school to take some California classes in education.  I taught for five years in Compton, California.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right.  Now what are the highlights of those years?
Speaker 2: I didn't realize I loved kids so much.  I, I taught kindergarten.  Kindergarten was like my favorite.  When I was subbing I used to tell them, "Don't give me anything past third grade," because the kids were--well past fourth grade, they were about as big as I was at the time then and I had to get used to California kids you know coming from the South, I would use phrases that they weren't familiar with, you know I'd say things like instead of pass me your paper to look at it whatever, I say let me hold your paper.  'Cause that was the way we talked you know.  You sit at the dinner table you say you know let me hold the salt.  You didn't say pass me the salt, you let me hold it.
Speaker 1: Let me hold it.
Speaker 2: Yeah so they looking at me like what are you talking about.  So I had to learn these things you know but I enjoyed, I enjoyed teaching.  I really did.  The kindergarteners, which is probably why I didn't have a kid right away because I had these kids you know I was always coming home telling Bernard stories about somebody I wanted to bring home you know and Compton at that time, school was predominantly black and Hispanic actually.  Yeah even back then somewhat segregated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was--I tell you what that was the first time I really had had a chance to work with white folks because the only time I did that a little bit was that summer of '66 [1966] when I went to--when I was at the school [Evelyn Hamblen Elementary School, St. Augustine, Florida], but here all of a sudden now I'm working with you know my, they're my, my comrades and they're my--they get to be my friends you know so we're in meetings together and doing all that kind of stuff. And so that was, that was the learning experience.  It really was.  And yeah it was.  Kindergarten was my favorite though just because the kids they just love you regardless you know and they want hugs all the time (laughter).  So I enjoyed it.  I really did.
Speaker 1: So what grade did you teach the most?
Speaker 2: I taught second grade the most actually.  I started out with third, then I went to kindergarten and then I had second grade for two years I had second grade, which was really good too because first grade you know you really get--first grade was a lot of responsibility I think I substituted a little bit then.  Didn't like first. Second grade they kind of learning about themselves a little bit and, and you know kind of understanding what they know and don't know a little bit there so yeah, I like second grade.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I never taught--I never used English as, as a you know to teach at all.  I used to always say if I taught in high school I wanted, wanted to teach something that they didn't have to take (laughter).  I would have wanted to teach an elective because high school kids, little scary you know.  I seen that, don't want to teach that.
Story_ID: 650235
Speaker 1: So I know Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] leaves Xerox [Xerox Corporation] in '73 [1973], is that it?
Speaker 2: No left, left Humble Oil [Humble Oil and Refining Company; Exxon Company, U.S.A.].
Speaker 1: Humble Oil for Xerox in '73 [1973] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah seventy, seventy--actually I think it was like '71 [1971].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah I think it was '71 [1971].  Yeah started in Xerox in '71 [1971] yeah.
Speaker 1: And soon--
Speaker 2: I'm still teaching then.  We, we bought our first house by then.  We had brought--we had gotten rid of our old car.  We bought a--we'd started with a 1961 Dodge Lancer that we paid $250 for that. I eventually learned to drive.  It was push button on the thing you know.  It had no air, no con- no heat, no I don't think the radio worked (laughter). But we had it painted, had it reupholstered and that was what I drove and then when I was teaching I think about my third year, 1972 we bought a brand new Mercedes Benz SE Sedan and I remembered I wanted--we wanted to buy the little one, the two seater and we got very practical because that summer his mother [Christine Kinsey] was coming to visit and my [paternal] grandmother [Susie Plummer Pooler] and my uncle [James Webster] and Barbara [Barbara Richardson Johnson] were coming to visit and we kept saying if we buy a two seater car, we're gonna have to rent a car just to take them around and that was another expense.  So we said nope, we're gonna buy and at that time too we saying we would eventually have a family and we'll need a bigger car anyway and so that's what we bought.  We kept it for twelve years.
Speaker 1: Now you had quite a bit of travel--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --in the early days?
Speaker 2: We started--we traveled early um-hm.  By then let's me see we bought the house in '71 [1971] I think it was yeah.  Big house and a pool and everything and everybody used to wanna come visit us and so which was fine because we always had to go to Disneyland [Anaheim, California] and do all that stuff but then we started traveling ourselves and the first few trips we would take would be we'd go up to Canada and go down to Mexico and then we ventured on our first across the water trip as I like to call it was to South America.  But that was late--that was '75 [1975], '76 [1976].  Yeah that was 1976 but where am I with that story?
Speaker 1: Are you all--the question one of the questions I have did you all start you and Bernard start to collect things at this juncture?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In fact I think you said you started in Florida (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We started yeah 'cause I can remember, I can remember going to--this was not out of the country, but I can remember going to New Orleans [Louisiana] to visit some high school friends of ours not high school, college friends of ours there and seeing things that, that you know I had never seen before, artwork and sculptures and things like that and stuff and actually buying something there.  I can't recall what it was or where it is right now but finding out that that--well we always felt like we had to bring something back from wherever we've gone first of all and that was just to remind us of the trip. And then we realize we were looking at things that were even native to that area or even native to that area or it might be of another, of another culture and for instance with him having been a park ranger at the Grand Canyon [Arizona], we started with Native American stuff you know had Navajo and Hopi stuff, kachina dolls and you know baskets that kind of stuff we'd always buy.  As a matter of fact some of them are still here in the house too.  Then we realized at some point we didn't know enough about our own; and so that's when we kind of start collecting our stuff.
Story_ID: 650236
Speaker 1: Yeah well tell us something about your economic--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --modus operandi I guess?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think it kind of--well first of all my background was very modest, living with my [paternal] grandmother [Susie Plummer Pooler].  Like I mentioned earlier we lived in a two bedroom shotgun house.  While my [paternal] uncle [James Webster] had a nice house, that was his house, that wasn't my house even though I visited and spent time there and stuff and all.  Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] grew up in a fairly middle class family.  His dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] was principal also and his mom [Christine Kinsey] never had to work.  So he grew with a notion you know that his dad took care of the household, you know.  They lived on his dad's salary because his mom never worked.  There were five kids and she never worked.  And so when we got married, we really--since we've been sort of saving money all the time, and we talk about, we talk about say coming to California with twenty-six dollars and a job because literally that was what he had in his pocket when he got to California is twenty-six dollars even though we were saving. And so we continued that saving process.  Since he'd come from a family where his, his dad, they lived on his dad's salary, we decided that we could live on one salary.  So while I worked we saved my salary and lived on his.  So for fifteen years I worked full time and during that time we never spent my paycheck.  We always saved it.  We saved his raises, got a promotion whatever went with that we saved, his bonuses we saved and it really kind of gave us a jump on things.  You know we used to say, and I laugh about it now, I say we were raised in Florida but we grew up in California because it made us have to kind of be on our own and understand what being an adult was like really and we just knew that were things that we were not gonna fall for in a sense. When--and we had friends who always had new cars and stuff and we didn't.  We saved our money.  We bought our house before we ever bought a new car.  And then once he went to work for Xerox [Xerox Corporation] and was doing well, he would always get promoted, which meant okay that house got sold, which meant we bought another house and it just pyramided and so we you know we just kept going.  We started traveling a little bit more then. My friends tease me now because they say, "Oh that's your money y'all spending how, huh?" Since you saved all that time.  But you get in that habit and you realize that you don't have to have things, things you know to make you happy. We spent our money on travel and on as it is now on art and history and so that's been our modus operandi, the, the--all the years we've been married and it's something that we like to tell young people that they--well we welcome them to emulate it too.  Bernard has a thing now where when we go shopping, he always put one thing back.  He says it's about saying that I don't have to have that you know what I mean.  It's, it's and you don't, you don't.  And I talked about earlier how mama made all my clothes and stuff when I was growing up, well I made a lot of my clothes when we were first married you know.  I made the bedspreads and the, the draperies and all that stuff. So we just didn't, we bought used furniture you know we just didn't do all the stuff that you--how can I say--that you, that you look at, that you may not have for very long. You know we just didn't do all that stuff so. And that's something I'm very proud of actually that we were able to just kind of--and, and I say we live in California but we always stayed grounded in what we grew up with and grounded in, in our roots really, which is why we still have all our college friends (laughter) still in our lives.  Yeah.
Story_ID: 650237
Speaker 1: So this is a--'cause your son wasn't born until like after you've been married ten years?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were married ten years before he was born. And, and again those first ten years we traveled quite a bit.  We used to go to national parks a lot, too.  We would get in the car, in our new Mercedes [Mercedes Benz], get in the car and drive up to Yosemite [Yosemite National Park, California] and drive to Yellowstone [Yellowstone National Park] and drive to the Grand Canyon [Arizona] and just go all over and then we started venturing out of the country.  I mentioned earlier we'd go to Mexico, we'd go to Mexico City [Mexico].  Again, we, we were very interested in you know like the Aztec culture and the, the, the I can't remember what the other one is down there the Teotihuacans down there and all that stuff. And then the same with Canada you know the, the Inuit culture up there, the Eskimos, the whole thing.  And some of our earlier collections were of those items. But again, they were of another culture. And so when Khalil [Khalil Kinsey] was born 19--1976 we went to South America. Visiting Brazil was quite interesting because you've got all these people of color there you know and and learning that that's where you know well you always knew they were part of slavery and that's where the black folks came from there even though they talk about not having a race problem there, it's very much a class problem and the class obviously is the darker skin people are of the lower class and lighter skin people are--so it's a race problem but anyway we, we learned a lot when traveling like that we really did and then the next year was when Khalil was born and 'Roots' was done that year, Alex Haley's 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family'] was televised and so we really began to realize we didn't know enough about our own culture and we needed to know more.
Speaker 1: So did 'Roots' play a significant role in waking you up to that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, I didn't think about it originally but I think it did.  I think it did and the mere fact that it happened simultaneously almost. Khalil was born like I think three weeks after 'Roots' was shown on TV, so I had spent you know two weeks (laughter) of watching 'Roots'; and then now he's coming.
Story_ID: 650238
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but his name is important, I think in this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --'cause he could have been named Bernard or--Bernard.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, but we, we named Khalil [Khalil Kinsey]--when he was born I'd had all these girls names picked out because I thought it--surely I was gonna have a girl. And the only boy's name (laughter) I had out Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] didn't like.  And I was determined that I was--he's not gonna be Bernard, Jr.  So Kahlil Gibran is someone that I read in college actually.  I worked in the library when I was in school and really loved the book 'The Prophet' and so we had a copy of it.  To be totally honest with you my copy of it is from Coleman Library [S.H. Coleman Memorial Library] at Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  I don't know how I wound up with it but (laughter). And so we, we both used to read him and so Bernard went home and we came back the next day it was three days and we hadn't named Khalil yet and so he came back and he said, "I think I got the name."  And so we named him Khalil.  I had a roommate in the hospital at the time and she was Armenian and she said to me that the, the old world spelling for his name was, K-H-A-L-I-L, which is how we spell it, and lo and behold Khalil is a writer.  My son is a writer you won't believe it.  He was telling me, "Mom I don't know why you surprised you named me after a poet; you named me after a writer."  But that's how he got his name and then his middle name is Bernard so he's Khalil Bernard Kinsey and our friends tease us 'cause one friend of mine used to say he said, "I'm so glad you named that child that."  He said, "I thought you was gonna name him Charles, or James or something."  I said, "What? Did we seem that boring (laughter) that we would do that?"  But anyway, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
Story_ID: 650239
Speaker 1: And then we started collecting art first, actually. Ernie Barnes, you're familiar with, the elongated figures. And they were always images of, of young people, one in particular where this African American boy is trying to make a basket and of course it reminded us of home really and then one's a little girl's jumping rope and you know shooting marbles and stuff.  All of, all of it reminded us of our days of growing up and that's what attracted us to it actually.  At the time I didn't know that the show 'Good Times' that the artwork there was done by Ernie Barnes.
Speaker 2: So you were collecting it without even knowing it?
Speaker 1: Without even knowing it, unh-uh, didn't know that, just liked it.  You know I think we went to a show or something, an art show or exhibit or museum or something and saw it and started.
Speaker 2: Now did you have any, did you or Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] at that point have any, say in 1977, '78 [1978] had you had any training in terms of black art history or anything?
Speaker 1: Let me think here. I can't, I can't say that I had.  I'm thinking that we would go, I remember going to a lot of festivals.  We would go to--Westwood [Los Angeles, California] used to have a like a little art show kind of thing and so there'd be something there from, it, it would be mainly though Afrocentric stuff you know 'cause I remember collecting some of that stuff too and I have masks and all too.  But it would kind of you know kind of that would tug you a little bit you know that you need to know a little bit more or look at this, look at that kind of thing and I can't say exactly where we saw Ernie's work but I'm pretty sure it was somebody we knew who either took us to a gallery or there was a showing or something or whatever.  I found out later, I didn't know it at the time either, that he also went to the same college that my sister [Kinsey's cousin, Barbara Richardson Johnson] went to in North Carolina [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] and they were there at the same time (laughter).  And she remembers him and she said, "But he was a football player you know.  I didn't deal with football players then."  She said, "I didn't know he was gonna grow up and be an artist."  My sister as a matter of fact was an art major at, at North Carolina when she was in school too and I think about it now I say maybe that's where some of the art stuff comes from too because she used to make me sit on the porch and she'd have to sketch me and stuff and all too, but um-hm.  Yeah but Ernie Barnes was one of our first pieces actually and that one I described earlier about the young man trying to make the basket, wound up being in 1978, Bernard was branch manager in Oakland, California, and that wound up being a piece that he would buy prints of and give as his awards to his top salespeople because it's called 'High Aspirations' [Ernie Barnes] so instead of giving his top salespeople a plaque with their stats on it, he gave them a print of this particular piece 'High Aspirations' and put the little plaque on there with their name and their stats.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Little did we know then that here we are now trying to share our culture with others you know.  We didn't about it at the time but that's, that's what's happening. And we run across people even now that say they still have it.  And it was a print so it wasn't a, you know, an original or anything like that, but framed up nicely; and it hangs, yeah, hangs well.
Story_ID: 650240
Speaker 1: As you go into the '80s [1980s]--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --did--had you started collecting documents at this point?
Speaker 2: Mid-'80s [1980s] I'm gonna say, mid-'80s [1980s] I remember Khalil [Khalil Kinsey] came home with his third grade family history report and you know we called home and got all the information we could get and he did a good job with his family history report but he came home then talking about the kids in his class would go back to the Mayflower or who had ancestors in France and in Spain, England and all this stuff and he'd have these questions that we literally couldn't answer frankly and he used to always ask me too you know, why did all his reports have to be on black people?  I said, "Because you have to know this and you have to help other people understand it."  And but when he had that report and we realized that we could not, you know, fill in a lot of the gaps and stuff and all and I jokingly said that Ebony and Jet wasn't enough that we need to do more and then that's when we really kind of started looking at historical stuff. And again we still don't go as far back as we should be able to with our own personal ancestry but we started collecting, the collective untold stories that the collective history of people.  You know because our kids nowadays you know, well, I'll talk about that a little later, you know black history is Black History Month is February and you get the same people, you talk about the same people very year.  Kids say every year I don't care what grade they're in, that's what they do and a lot of other people have done things and that's what we want, that's what we wanted to learn about and that's who we wanted to inspire.
Speaker 1: Yeah, some of the documents I know that you included in your collection you know teach those kinds of stories--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --but where do you find, well at some point I guess you all met [HistoryMaker] Charles Blockson--
Speaker 2: Yeah Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] was very, very impressed with him before he had a chance to meet him.  Just, just the idea of what he's done, you know has just been--
Speaker 1: So you all knew about him?
Speaker 2: --yeah knew about him and just mainly in research because you know for instance like through Ernie [Ernie Barnes] we wound up--and we eventually met Ernie and, and you know really became friends with him and then you meet other artists and then other people from other parts of the country growing up in areas in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] knew about Blockson that you didn't know about you know so we kind of wound up saying oh yeah well I need to learn more about that person.  Let me find out what that's about.  There was another friend of ours Al Martins [ph.], who was a Xerox [Xerox Corporation] person a little bit older than us. And I can't remember where Al grew up, can't remember but he, he just seemed to know a lot about black history and stuff and all was very inspirational in us acquiring some pieces.  Bernard had gone down to Dallas [Texas] with him or something and someone had these Harper's Weekly images of black folks and so that was like mid-'80s [1980s] and I remember Bernard came home he must have had like twelve of them.  I'm like and then now he looks back on it and now he says, "I should have gotten more back then."
Speaker 1: These are original Harper's Weeklies from--
Speaker 2: Um-hm you frame them and everything and they're downstairs in the, in the, where we were downstairs.  That's some of those images you saw down there.
Speaker 1: Now this was Al?  What was Al's last name?
Speaker 2: Al Martins was his name.
Speaker 1: And he taught--
Speaker 2: No he was a Xerox employee.
Speaker 1: Xerox employee.
Speaker 2: Xerox person um-hm we met through, through the years and stuff and all and everything. And he was part of the, you know Xerox had a black caucus group and so he was part of that.  But he was in Dallas at the time.  He eventually lived out here but he's passed on now too, so many people we've lost. But that kind of was a jumpstart I'll say because here was one place you could find a lot of information you know and a lot of images that just kind of helps you move along.
Speaker 1: So these material, say the documents, the Harper's, were they at an estate sale or what?
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much so.  Um-hm, um-hm and whoever owned them had just--and I'm trying to remember how many, there's two or three of them in the exhibit now.  The one casting the first ballot--first vote, that one's in the exhibit, it's exhibiting now which is about three of them in there.  I can't think of what the other one's are right off hand; but there's still some, some that we have downstairs.
Story_ID: 650241
Speaker 1: I remember like Khalil [Khalil Kinsey], you know, when he wanted to do a report on Matthew Henson because he'd read somewhere about that. And, and we were able to find the book on Matthew Henson.  Then--and, and in doing research on that come to find out that Bernard had a high school classmate who was a professor at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] who just loved the idea of Matthew Henson who then went to--he's a neurobiologist really but his love is anthropology and stuff and all but he actually went to Greenland and had with the United States government had been--disinterred the body there and had the body re- reburied at Arlington [Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Virginia].
Speaker 2: Of Matthew Henson?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm and so this winds up being a high school classmate of Bernard's who did this you know so it's all these connections and stuff and all you know. So when that happened now we got the book, now we got the articles about him and the whole bit and and Khalil, he's like in heaven now because I, you know, I did a report about him before even having all of that, you know so it just kind of made an impact.  And I had, I remember he's about in sixth grade and one of this, one of the parents of his classmates called me because for some reason his son wanted to find out who wrote and wanted the words to the Negro National Anthem ['Lift Every Voice and Sing'] and of course they say who's gonna know that but Shirley [HistoryMaker Shirley Kinsey] and [HistoryMaker] Bernard Kinsey, and of course you know. They had heard he--I think he said his son had heard the song or something and the son I think was a music person or something but he loved just the melody of it or something.  He said he wanted to know the words to it.  So I said okay yes, we can do that because now we're educating you.
Speaker 2: Now these are white people?
Speaker 1: Um-hm yeah, they're a Jewish couple.  Yeah but they wanted, they wanted, um-hm, I said, "Yeah we can do that." And you never and that now that was before we started having exhibits you know.  I say collecting, we were collecting but we weren't collecting for the collection to become a collection or to become an exhibit to become you know on tours and stuff and all.  We were basically trying to educate ourselves a little bit more and our friends. And we had a lot friends whose kids like same age as Khalil and a lot of Xerox [Xerox Corporation] families and stuff and just trying to get them all on board because we all knew at one point they were gonna go to FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] hopefully (laughter); and they needed to know all this stuff coming from California.
Story_ID: 650242
Speaker 1: Did--
Speaker 2: Where are we?
Speaker 1: --Bernard's [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] work in real estate support the collecting in any way (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, no, no what happened with that is we started out delving in real estate.  When we bought the first house, and bought an apartment building and we had some commercial real estate in (unclear) too but--and I, and I always I thank Xerox [Xerox Corporation] for these days really because it was almost like being in the military in a sense because he would get promoted and we'd have to move somewhere okay.  So when we bought the house in '71 [1971], December of '72 [1972] he gets promoted and he's going to San Francisco [California].  Well you can't commute there from Inglewood [California] to San Francisco so we sold the house, made money on the house and moved to San Francisco, bought a house there in Diamond Heights, great area, townhouse in San Francisco, great view everything and then I, that's when I left teaching and I went to work for Xerox.  Then we moved there in December of '72 [1972], there were three--
Speaker 1: So you were a trainer for Xerox?
Speaker 2: Um-hm what happened was there were three openings and I must admit Bernard's manager who had put in for a promotion suggested that I interview for this job.  There were three openings in the office for the three year jobs.  One was promised to the branch manager secretary because she wanted it.  The other one they wanted someone with teaching background and they didn't have anybody black and so here I was, (laughter) which was great.  So I was able to use my teaching background and become a trainer and basically, it's, it's customer support where the sales rep sells the equipment and then I've gotta make sure the customer keeps it 'cause I've gotta go in there and train them on it and bring them up to speed and all that kind of stuff.  I give classes at the office where other companies bring--send their people in; then I also visit their offices and train their staff and all that stuff.
Story_ID: 650243
Speaker 1: So I did that for ten years. Seventy-two [1972], end of '72 [1972] to '82 [1982]; but in the meantime he keeps getting promoted every two or three years which means we gotta sell the house. Which means you're buying another house but you made money on that one so it kept going.  So we went from Los Angeles [California] to San Francisco [California] back to Los Angeles, lived over in Los Feliz over by Griffith Park [Los Angeles, California]. Excuse me. Interestingly enough we made an offer on a house here in the Palisades [Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California] by the Getty [J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles, California] past the restaurant up there, we made an offer on a house there but it was right during the energy crisis and he said this was gonna take too long to be able to get back and forth to work and stuff so we bought a place closer.  Then from--where did we go from there?  This was before Khalil [Khalil Kinsey] was born now so from there we went I think we went back oh to Orange County, Anaheim [California], and then Anaheim, Khalil was born there in Anaheim. Then we moved to Oakland [California] so up and down the coast.  Great house in Oakland, we lived there for four years longest we ever lived anywhere.  Can you imagine that?  Then 1980, Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] got promoted and we had to go to Rochester, New York.  We thought that was gonna be two years.  It was miserable, miserable, miserable, miserable, miserable.  It was the worst--
Speaker 2: How long were--
Speaker 1: --we only stayed for eight months.
Speaker 2: This is in what year?
Speaker 1: This is 1980.
Speaker 2: Eighty [1980].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty [1980] we moved there.  That was gonna be two years.  The best thing about it was we were able to go drive and see the trees turning color and stuff and all. But when the snow started coming it was miserable, worst eight months of my life I should say there.  But he got promoted before the two years so he was there from January to November.  I was there from May until December and he got promoted and he was promoted back to California and that was Orange County and that was when we moved to San Clemente [California] and I used to tell him all the time then, I said it was too far was L.A. I didn't wanna be down there, moved down there and loved it.  Bought this great big house that I used to say was too big and it cost too much but I loved it (laughter).  And we stayed there for three years.  No actually we were there no yeah we were there in '81 [1981] so we were there for four years, four years because we moved back to here in '85 [1985] yeah.  But had gotten on the, gotten on the--you know you get used to moving every three to four years frankly so our friends used to tell us all the time, they'd say, "Your house is always like a model house, model home."  I said, "Because I'm always getting ready to put it on the market. I know I'm gonna move."  Which was good in a sense because you didn't--you collected things and you kept things that you wanted to keep.  You got rid of the frivolous stuff you know.  So we moved back to L.A.
Speaker 2: So I suppose there are new places to look too for things?
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 2: In all these new locations (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: So Rochester is an historical place--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --even though you didn't stay there.
Speaker 1: Even though I didn't like it there, it was too cold.
Speaker 2: Yeah it was cold but--
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah exactly.
Speaker 2: --this is the, this is the home of Frederick Douglass--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right, right, right.
Speaker 2: --for most of his life.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so you, yeah so you're right you learn all these things from where, wherever you are.
Story_ID: 650244
Speaker 1: Then when, when we got ready to leave San Clemente [California] by that time we had gotten--a lot of our friends had moved down there.  Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey], bless his heart you know Xerox [Xerox Corporation] helped hire a lot of block folks and some of them wound up being FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] friends of our, frankly.  He used to always say everybody else is hiring everybody else so we can hire them too.  So by that time my sister [Kinsey's cousin, Barbara Richardson Johnson] had moved out here.  She was living in San Juan Capistrano [California].  The guy who was the best man at our wedding had moved out here.  I had introduced him to his wife.  They'd gotten married and they moved down there, child about the same age as Khalil [Khalil Kinsey].  Another couple from FAMU and then another couple so there were like four couples and kids all you know close in age and stuff and so when we got ready to move everybody was saying, "What, you guys are leaving?"  So we moved.  One couple is still there, the best man and his wife are still there.  The two other couples ultimately got a divorce actually so they're no longer there.  But because of that and because of moving and realizing you know real estate is a good investment for one thing, we moved back to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and we bought a house on Chautauqua [Boulevard] here in L.A. in (unclear) Palisades [Pacific Palisades] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So what year was this?
Speaker 1: This was 1985.
Speaker 2: Eighty-five [1985] okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Um-hm and that's when we kind of started doing real estate a little bit more, frankly.  Moved there and loved the house, remodeled it. And the real estate market was doing fairly well then, and realtors literally would ring the doorbell if you've done a good job on this remodel and stuff and wanna know if you wanna sell it and of course we were saying no but then we realized the street was very busy.  Khalil was riding his bike and skateboarding and just seems it was just getting a little bit too busy so we decided we were gonna put it on the market and we did.  So lived there for like a year and a half.  Put it on the market and it sold like (snaps fingers) that.
Story_ID: 650245
Speaker 1: So we bought another house on Amalfi in Palisades [Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California].  Didn't like it that much but okay we'll, we'll buy it, live in it for a while and redo it because we'd gotten used to moving you know these other times so we did that and by this time that was 1986 yeah we moved in there, remodeled that one, lived in it while we were remodeling it.  Eighty-seven [1987] was our twentieth anniversary and we said okay we're never gonna do this again.  We'll remodel but we're never living in it while we do it.  We're gonna renew our, our vows and that's gonna be part of the contract that we're not gonna do this. Anyway.  So Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] is still at Xerox [Xerox Corporation] by this time.  I'd left because at some point he became manager of anybody I was gonna work for.  So I had to leave you know there was nowhere else to go.  So I started being the one then who had to, I was you know meeting the contractors, working with the, the architect and the redesign, making the payroll so to speak, choosing the materials, doing the--all that stuff so then that became we had KBK Enterprises [KBK Enterprises, Inc.] by that time which he used for another reason but that's when that became. So about ten years that's basically what I did.  He left in '91 [1991] and became more involved in it but we wound up with--here in the Palisades now.  We've been here how many years now, this is what? We've been here twenty-eight years.  Ooh gosh, twenty-eight years.
Speaker 2: In this house?
Speaker 1: No.  We been in this house eighteen years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Longest, longest, longest we've ever lived but the first from '85 [1985] to '95 [1995] we did--bought six houses in the City of Palisades [Pacific Palisades, California].  One we lived in, one was the highest priced house sold in the market in 1989 no, 1990, 1990 because what had happened was we--by that time we'd done two houses, we bought another one, we were remodeling it, we moved in it.  It was a huge place.  We moved in it.  We knew that we weren't gonna stay there too long but we stayed a couple of years but in the mean time we found this lot where we are on now.  It was a two bedroom house and we knew this is where we wanted to be.  So we went ahead and bought it and put the other house on the market and it sold like in a month and the guy wanted it in a month.  So we said, "Okay fine, we can do that." And we moved here in the two bedroom and lived here for like two years, put everything in storage, yeah, put everything in storage.  He's still working this is '80 [1980]--this is '90 [1990]. And in 1991 he retired and we had bought another house because we were getting ready to tear this one down and remodel which we thought, which didn't take place right away.  But we bought another house, lived in it for two years and then got started on this one and each time we lived on Amalfi Drive.  We had four houses on Amalfi Drive.  One we never lived in.  One we did two years just to spec but the market is crazy.  People and people liked what we did in terms of the remodel stuff and all, and two realtors in particular would just always wanna know, "What are you doing, what y'all gonna do next?"  It became a business.  It became a business.  We always made sure Khalil [Khalil Kinsey] didn't have to leave school.  He could always go to the same school you know and and as I said one time we were on the same street for three times, three different addresses, 554, 1079 and 1213 yeah just a few blocks one was only yeah about a block from each other. Until we built this house and so then that's when we said okay we're not doing this anymore now, we're staying here and that's where we are. And that's--we moved in here in '95 [1995], 1995 started building a month after the Northridge earthquake in '94 [1994] because it took us a while to, to get--we talked about having gone to Gladstones [Pacific Palisades, California].  We had to go before--California has this thing called a coastal permission that you have to petition if you're gonna build anything that's along the coast.  Whether the--doesn't have to be on the water, just anything. And so we had, we had one young man on the coastal permission, he said that when he saw the images and stuff and all he said it was gonna be a visual eyesore from the--it's gonna be a distraction from Pacific Coast Highway because you can see it coming up.  Crazy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We had to go before a commission to get and when we went before the commission they actually gave us, it was a unanimous permit and he had idea--no reason doing that.  But we kind of all know why even in this day and age. Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay so you got a beautiful view here--
Speaker 1: Beautiful view. Yep (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) of the Pacific Ocean near Sunset Drive--Sunset Boulevard and Highway 1 [California State Route 1].
Story_ID: 650246
Speaker 1: So you said some events took place in this house that led to (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes and actually I should go back a little bit.  You know we've been talking about some of the artwork and collecting and stuff.  One of the things that we started doing early on once we started collecting art and paintings particularly was that we wanted to introduce artists to our friends. And so we started having, we'd have an art show at the house. [HistoryMaker] Ed Dwight who's, who's a wonderful sculptor who was the first--he's, his whole life is historic too.  I mean he was the first black astronaut trainee under Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] and then went and turned on the other side of his brain. His passion is sculpting. And so we did an art show for him in 1987 at our second house in the Palisades [Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California] frankly and that was our first big show and--because we didn't know about him initially.  In 1986 I think it was we were in Hawaii and saw his work in a gallery there. And so the, the gallery owner was telling us who he was and he had been an astronaut trainee. We literally both looked at each other and said how come we don't know about him?  He is African American and we don't know this about him?  And so Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] literally--found out he was in Denver [Colorado], called him up, invited him to come to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] and what we do? The Urban League dinner was going on.  We invited him to that and became friends and started having--so we had two shows for him.  One there and had one here.  Each time he sold like really, really well you know because people just, they love his work but nobody--don't know him.  Matter of fact Debbie Allen and Norm Nixon became very, very big collectors of his and they've had art shows for him since you know since that time.  And it's just been a real pleasure seeing, that, that, that work.  His I think was one of the first shows we did.  Then we did another one for [HistoryMaker] Jonathan Green and that was in this house.  That was like the early, late--mid-'90s [1990s] or so. Jonathan Green.  I have some abstracts on the wall back here.  Bill Dallas lives in Oakland [California] kind of an unknown artist, but we really like his work and so we had a show with him. [HistoryMaker] Phoebe Beasley is a good friend of ours now and we've done stuff with her and it's just been great to be able to promote you know their work, not only for us to have it but for other people to have the pleasure of meeting them and of having it in their homes.  So that's been a big thing.
Story_ID: 650247
Speaker 1: The other thing that's happened a lot at this house has been we've always, we've always been really high on education and wanting African American kids to go to black colleges [HBCUs] and primarily kids from California really because they really don't have an idea of what it's like to go to a black college and they wind up going to schools out here.  One of Khalil's [Khalil Kinsey] friends said to me, "Ms. Kinsey [HistoryMaker Shirley Kinsey], any black colleges in California?  I'll go if there's any in California."  So we always tell him go, even if you just go for a year.  If you have to transfer, transfer, but just go and get that experience.  And so we started working with an organization called College Bound and so we would host fundraisers for them here at the house.  We've actually done quite a bit, quite a bit with them.  And then of course FAMU [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida], our alumni association is very active out here and so we've done a lot of stuff with them with fundraising.  We have some Howard University [Washington, D.C.] friends who ask us to do things.  They said, "Okay if you're not sending people to FAMU how come--let's send them to Howard." And so we worked with them on things.  It's been really good to be able to actually have the space to be able to do that but also to know that it's going towards a cause, towards education. Now with the arts I mentioned having the art shows and stuff, we're part of an organization that started the William H. Johnson Foundation [William H. Johnson Foundation for the Arts], which helps young artists, let them continue their education and that's been quite interesting too.
Speaker 2: It's named for the artist William H. Johnson?
Speaker 1: William H. Johnson, um-hm.  He--African American artist who actually had been buried in an unmarked grave and so part of the work we did initially was to raise funds to get his grave marked in Florence, Florence, South Carolina, I think that's where he is.  But he spent time in, in Europe.  Most of his work and stuff was done there and--but he's African American.  But as you probably know too, a lot of our writers and singers and entertainers and artists and all spent a lot of time in Europe in the early years of their career; and that's how they became known you know, had lots of fans and stuff there.
Story_ID: 650248
Speaker 1: A lot of the artists that we've collected who are alive we try and, make a point of getting to know them you know.  With, with exhibits we've been doing, I'm looking around here, we've been able to have several of them come for openings and wherever the exhibit is and, so people get to have a chance to talk to them about their impression of what they've done and that kind of thing and so it's been interesting, quite interesting.  I'm getting a little ahead I know but that's okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's--okay so in--well let's see. When did you decide or did you start working towards the idea that you were gonna exhibit a collection at some point?  Or did somebody suggest it to you?
Speaker 1: Well it sort of you know--we have a lot of friends who are collectors and so we never say that ours is the biggest, the best or anything like that because I have friends who have fabulous collections, I mean fabulous.  I think what happened with us was when we went between art and history they got kind of noticed a little differently.  Khalil [Khalil Kinsey] would have friends--and we didn't realize initially, but Khalil would have friends come over, they were like in their teens and stuff at that point and they would come here and because we always invited them for New Year's and 4th of July and birthdays and all that kind of stuff, he always had his friends over.  And so Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] would take them downstairs where we were earlier today and just give 'em a history lesson and Khalil would be ready to go to the next function they all wanted to make and they wouldn't wanna leave.  They, 'cause they didn't know this stuff you know they were just immersed in it.  Then they would turn around and they'd ask you know, "Can I come back?  I wanna bring my brother.  I wanna bring my girlfriend, I wanna bring--," and so we kind of knew it was touching young people for one thing.  Older people, all of us don't know it either but the young folks were really kind of you know wanting to know a little bit more.  And I think in a sense we would see--it would seem like they were almost becoming empowered by this knowledge of their history and then doing research on their own and you get some of them would come back and say oh, "Mr. Kinsey, do you know about So and So?  And I read about such and such and such," and they always try to one up him or something you know.  Tell him something they didn't think he knew, that they learned you know.
Story_ID: 650249
Speaker 1: And--when was it? Two thousand five [2005], what happened 2005, 2005?  Two thousand five [2005]. A friend of ours who was, not so much a friend, but an acquaintance of ours who was working with the L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] and she knew about the house.  We had--I'm gonna back up just a little bit here before I even do that because I talked about, I was talking about some of the things that we've done here, how do I do this?  History okay.  We're now dealing with historical items but we're also realizing that at the same time it was history happening around us and so we--other than having the art shows we also started having dinners here at the house and we would have somebody we'd always wanted to know or meet or whatever and invite other people in that same field perhaps to be here.  So one of the ones (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) For instance okay yeah, (unclear) get you to talking (unclear).
Speaker 1: So actually I shouldn't say it was people we wanted to meet because some of them we knew already but for instance we had a dinner here for Mayor Tom Bradley and it was after he'd become ill and he actually couldn't talk at the time but we kept saying he needed to have something done with him intimately before he was gone.  So we allowed him to make his invitation list and he invited, he actually invited friends from his grade school years that he was still friends with, okay, and family members and we had oh I don't know might have been fifty people here so. And we had this dinner party for him and just to give him his props and stuff and all okay.  Then we had a chance to meet Mrs. Rosa Parks and we actually did a fundraiser for her here at the house and she had said to us that she had done lots of these dinners and stuff and all and everybody always invites her to things and but usually it winds up being shaking hands and doing autographs and that nobody had ever really helped her raise funds for her foundation [Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development], which is what we had wanted to do.  But during that time we had like Johnnie Cochran was here at the time, Julian Dixon was still alive at the time, Diane Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson] was here, the president of USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California], we invited him because Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] had said that he knew that she needed to have an honorary doctorate and so we invited the president of the university, sat him at the table here.  Who else was here?  Peter Norton from Norton AntiVirus. You know, he's a huge collector, collects all kinds of stuff.  He and his wife were here, were just a lot of lot of and then friends you know our friends and stuff because we wanted them to be able to meet her too and that was just a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful evening.  So Bernard had said to Steve Sample [Steven B. Sample] that, "You know you need to give Mrs. Parks an honorary doctorate."  He said, "Write my note on it," and that next May, lo and behold she's getting an honorary doctorate from USC.  He used to say it was the biggest thing.  His students enjoyed that more than anything else.  It was like the biggest thing that happened there you know at the time.  One year we had was a Pulitzer Prize photographer with the L.A. Times; he'd won a Pulitzer. Clarence Williams--no last name was Williams, can't think of his first name now.  But we'd invited him and then we're honoring him but we had a lot of black photographers here you know and this--I mean just, so those kinds of things; so for us it was like these are historical moments for us you know.
Story_ID: 650250
Speaker 1: So then in 2005 when L.A. Times [Los Angeles Times] called, one of the ladies had been here I think when we had the photographers here and she was a writer with L.A. Times. So she knew the house so she was now working for the home section and so she called and said, you know wanted to know if we would be interesting in letting them do a feature on the house, the architecture of the house and the whole bit.  And we said, "Yeah, well, okay come out we'll talk about it."  And she wanted to bring her editor with her.  When she did and they got here and they saw all the artwork, they said, "Oh no, this is more than just the style of the house, this is," (gesture). And by this time California African American Museum [Los Angeles, California]--she sort of knew sort of what we had but you know we hadn't really talked about doing anything. And when they came by here from the L.A. Times the article wound up being with this huge spread and it was the house and the artwork and the whole bit so then the California African American Museum contacted us.  One of the women on the board was a friend and she said, "You know we're trying to get the museum--get African American collectors to share their exhibits.  The museum needs to have content and so we'd love it if you guys would be a part of that," you know.
Speaker 2: Is this the museum in--
Speaker 1: Here. Locally here.
Speaker 2: --Los Angeles [California]--
Speaker 1: In Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: --the one near the old stadium?
Speaker 1: Um-hm, yeah Exposition Park [Los Angeles, California], over there right.  And so they came out and we talked and they said you know, "It, it would jumpstart it for us because if you guys do it you know we think we can get other collectors to do it and stuff too."  So we couldn't start right away and they found somebody in San Francisco [California] to do it and they, he did his and it went over very well and then ours went in.  Well in the meantime--oh I can't remember who--someone referred us to [HistoryMaker] Bill Whitaker at CBS and told him that this was a story that he should look at.  He's with 'CBS Sunday Morning' and so he talked to Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] on the phone.  Bernard was in Florida, he talked to Bernard on the phone, we had never met him, talked to Bernard on the phone I guess he did his research now this is before we, we'd set up that it's gonna go to the museum so the story was gonna be about it going to the museum I guess so Bernard called me and said, "Bill Whitaker's coming out on Thursday and they're gonna do a story on us with the art exhibit, about the art exhibit."  I said, "What do you mean?  Don't they have to come by here and see what this is all about before they decide this?"  He said, "No they're coming with the cameraman and with the producer and with somebody else or whatever and they'll be there on Thursday."  That's what they did.  So they came out, they did you know the whole interview and stuff here, then they said, "We're not gonna run it right away, we wanna wait until," that was in August of '06 [2006].  The article had come out like November of '05 [2005] and so this was August of '06 [2006] so they came out and they said, "Okay we're gonna wait until it opens at the museum because we're gonna follow you, wanna be at the museum when it's opening."  So they came out when it opened that weekend and they followed us in the museum and talked to people and you know got input on it and all that stuff and then they ran the article on 'CBS Sunday Morning,' Martin Luther King weekend in 2007 that Sunday, which was really pretty special, pretty special, pretty special.
Story_ID: 650251
Speaker 1: And from there, other museums started calling. So at the time--who was next? Cincinnati, Underground National--Railroad Freedom Center [National Underground Railroad Freedom Center, Cincinnati, Ohio].  Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] was on the board there and so they said, "Well you know we got this exhibit there. Why don't we bring it to Cincinnati [Ohio]?"  So we said, "Okay." So we did, went to Cincinnati then from there we went to the DuSable [DuSable Museum of African American History] in Chicago [Illinois].  We were there for I think we were there for about seven months.  Actually opened in July and they were there until March I believe, March, April that year.  So now we've done those three museums then who came after that?  Oh, Bernard's hometown called.  Somebody there knew about the exhibit and the, the Norton Museum [Norton Museum of Art] in West Palm Beach [Florida] is the majority museum and there's a--the school in West Palm Beach is named after Bernard's dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey], the elementary school that he went to is named after Bernard's dad.  And the museum had--and it's a school, a magnet school for the arts [U.B. Kinsey/Palmview Elementary School of the Arts, West Palm Beach, Florida]. So the museum locally there had partnered with that school, they kind of adopted that school. So when they heard about our collection it was like a no brainer and they said well we're the partner with the school, we need to bring Kinsey Collection [Kinsey African American Art and History Collection] here, so they did.  Now when we went there, the majority the museum--you know all things go--lots of stuff started happening and that's when the cell phone tour went into play when I said we had [HistoryMaker] Nichelle Nichols for us, we had Angela Bassett, we had--
Speaker 2: Lou Gossett [HistoryMaker Louis Cameron Gossett, Jr.].
Speaker 1: --Lou Gossett, Courtney Vance [Courtney B. Vance], Beverly Todd, who else is on? [HistoryMaker] Hattie Winston, on and on.  And so that was just like a really big thing because they had, they had the technology there already but they wanted to use this British voice that they use all the time.  But we said no, we have friends that we can get to do this. No, no, no.  And so that's that's how that came to be and so that was wonderful.  Well there their superintendent got behind the program really good and so he saw the educational aspect of it so he got his department involved and he had his principals come, and he had field trips for the kids so he got more notice there.  The museum won a White House award and Mrs. Bush [Laura Bush] presented to them for their community outreach and library services and stuff and all that used in the exhibits, it won the state award for something.  It was like three different awards it won while it was there which was really something.  Then--that's why all these magazines start happening.  Several of these are west Florida stuff.  Then from there it went to Tallahassee [Florida] because now it's--so it's going hometown, now it's going to our college hometown. And the governor got involved there then so we got the--won the lights award [Points of Light Award] and all this stuff.  That was Christie--Governor Crist [Charlie Crist], Governor Crist was there at the time then and it just has grown from there and the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] came down to visit me.  Actually they came to West Palm Beach.  Then they came to, they came here to the house, then they went to Tallahassee and it eventually went to the Smithsonian, the American history museum [National Museum of American History, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: In terms of curating the exhibit in the beginning, did you have help from the museum staff?
Speaker 1: Yeah in the beginning--
Speaker 2: Did they choose--help choose the pieces and what--how to do the presentation (simultaneous)
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yep.  The first, the first, the first two years I'll say the museum was very much involved.  California African American Museum [Los Angeles, California] was very much involved because--the local museum--because it toured under their auspices so they were very much involved with the, with the borrowing institution, they were a lending institute and they were a borrowing institution and so they were very much involved. And then after that we basically took it over.  It was--actually I shouldn't say we took it over, but our contract with them was up and they didn't really wanna--I shouldn't say they didn't wanna do it anymore, it was a lot of work and they wanted to concentrate more on what they had locally going on. And so we--really was supposed to come back, it was supposed to come back home frankly.
Speaker 2: So was the exhibit like actually packaged then you had the placards and the--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I mean the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The crates? Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I mean all the crates?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah everything is built for, for--yeah, yeah but by then it'd gone to like six museums under their auspices and I mean we were--it was gonna come back home and then the Smithsonian called and so we said okay now the museum's not involved anymore so that means we have to be involved and so that's kind of how we got more involved in it.  And at that point the, the Smithsonian, of course they have their own curators and you know so we really let them do it basically because they're knowledgeable about all that stuff. And it was a little different from the way it had been and we'd added some more historical pieces and by that time we were kind of seeing the vision a little bit differently also because it was giving be more emphasis on the historical stuff as opposed to the art and that was what was catching people's, touching people's hearts I should say and so we wanted to focus a little bit more on the historical stuff and so after the Smithsonian it rested for like year and a half frankly.  We just said we're tired, we're just not you know, we're just gonna wait.  And then who called? I can't remember who called after that.  We did some small things.  We did a couple of college things, did museum in Sacramento [California] one summer (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So this is around 2008, 2009?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: Two thousand eight [2008], 2009 are we?
Speaker 1: Oh no, we're now in two thousand--we left the Smithsonian in two thousand--it didn't go to Smithsonian until 2010, October 10 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh so we're past, way past that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: --oh wait a minute, we gotta go back (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) We got, gone too--got to go back?
Speaker 2: --and talk about--
Speaker 1: Where are we?
Story_ID: 650252
Speaker 1: Twenty ten [2010] the, you had an event called An Evening with Bernard and Shirley Kinsey: What You Didn't Learn in High School History?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This was at the--
Speaker 2: This was here locally at the--
Speaker 1: Ebony Repertory Theatre?
Speaker 2: --Ebony Repertory yeah, um-hm.
Speaker 1: Here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And that was 2010 was it?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What would happen is you know the exhibit was out of town but people who hadn't seen it when it was here would always wanna know when is it coming here?  How do we get to know more about it and stuff?  So the Ebony Repertory company, the Nate Holden theater [Nate Holden Performing Arts Center, Los Angeles, California], it's officially named wanted to do a kickoff for Black History Month and so they asked if there was anything we could do in terms of bringing anything down there to show to share whatever and so we had everything on slide anyway, slide presentation anyway so we said okay we can do like a virtual tour and so it became What You Didn't Learn in High School History.  Because Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] as he would always talk about it with these kids or something, he says, "These kids in high school, they don't even know this, they're not getting this in high school," you know and then we talk about how we didn't get it in high school and so that's where the title came from, What You Didn't Learn in High School History.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it became like a--it's a slide presentation.  He's really the historian in the family.  I kind of do a presentation and talk about what we've done, how we started you know and you kind of giving people background on it and then also a little bit about how you can--because people wanna know too how can I start doing this you know?  Because I tell people you don't have to start out with originals and stuff and all at first.  You start with prints you know which is what we did a lot of times you know.  You know see something you really like, there are few pieces we have as prints I said I'm never gonna own the original you know it's gonna cost too much for one thing and the people may not wanna sell it so I like that image and I want it in my space, so you know I acquire it that way. But that's where that came from so we kicked off African American history month in '10 [2010].  I think we did it again in '11 [2011] and I think we did it again in '12 [2012].  I believe we did we do it this year, I think we did it in '13 [2013] too.
Speaker 1: Now, you had already set up the Bernard and Shirley Kinsey Foundation--
Speaker 2: Foundation, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for the Arts and Education [sic. Bernard and Shirley Kinsey Foundation for Art and Education]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, we set that up in '08 [2008], 2008.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was when, that was again you know and some of this we were like learning as we were going because we didn't start out to do it this way you know. It's just, it's, it's been a blessing, it's been a journey, a wonderful journey frankly.
Story_ID: 650253
Speaker 1: And the people that you meet along the way has been part of the blessing.  The people that you meet and, and to hear you know teachers telling you that they're just glad that this is out here now because again one, one lady told me that she said when she was in seventh grade she told her teacher, "Can't we talk about somebody other than, than Mrs. Rosa Parks, other than Harriet Tubman?"  She said, "Didn't somebody do something?"  And the teacher basically said, "It's not in this book," you know.  Because as I said the kids get that the same people every year.  She said but now to be able to tell--what I didn't say was in Florida while the exhibit was in Florida was that our book was adopted to write a curriculum to teach African American history in the State of Florida.
Speaker 2: Okay now the book, this is the coffee table book (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The--it's the coffee table book, um-hm.
Speaker 2: It's a beautiful book.
Speaker 1: We started out with just a catalog and then--
Speaker 2: This is you have to talk about how this, this book was produced--was published by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: So this is, how did that take place?
Speaker 1: Well, that's really interesting too.  We had, we had done the book I guess it first came out like 2010. I can't remember, '09 [2009] or '10 [2010] because we had a small catalog that you know it goes with the exhibit when it's at the museum and stuff and all but we had said we had wanted to have our voices, our voice being heard with how and why this exhibit is here. And so we came out with an edition our you know the first edition and then I think it was Diane Watson [HistoryMaker Diane E. Watson] and somebody else saw it and said that they, they needed something for the Congressional Black Caucus when they have the convention and it was gonna be September that year and this was like in the spring sometime, and contacted us and so we went back and made presentations, showed them you know how it can be tailored to include their information because that's history too and so that's what we wound up doing.  So they, they, they you know put an order for certain number and that was their, their--I shouldn't call it the gift but, yeah people went home with taking a book home from the convention with our--with 'The Kinsey Collection' ['The Kinsey African American Art and History Collection'] and then the information on all the Black Caucus books, which was, was that the president's [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], no it wasn't his first year.  No it was '10 [2010]
Speaker 2: It was his second year.
Speaker 1: Ten [2010], second year.  Well, well, second year right, second year yeah, yeah and actually he spoke at the, he spoke at the dinner that night where the book was presented and stuff and all too. Um-hm, which was really good that was that final night.
Speaker 2: It's a beautiful book.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is, it is.  But since then now the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] had their convention out here in '11 [2011] or '12 [2012]. Was it '12 [2012]?  Whenever year their convention was and they contracted with us to produce their own book, so there's a version now with--has more images because we've expanded it.  It has more images and it's, and it's the NAACP version.  So it has all NAACP information in it.  Um-hm.  We add more pages, delete some of it. Because in, in our personal, I call it our personal edition, is where we know and we thank all the people who helped us you know and stuff and all but we can take that out and put in their information and so it's been, it's been a blessing and it's just been fabulous to be able to get all this out there you know.  The--and now well we'll keep going.  So that was two thousand-what '10 [2010]?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was the year then too that it was adopted in Florida with the curriculum. It's on iTune university [iTunes U].  We're in the process now of kind of revamping that because we need the international course standards for education that you have to meet and so they've got these new things in place and so now they've stopped using it because they have to really go back and redo, redo some things. But you could go on iTune university at that time and find the images. It wasn't the whole collection, but it was certain images they chose to highlight to teach certain skills.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 650254
Speaker 1: So the last--I guess what's been going on from 2011 until the present?
Speaker 2: 'Til the present?  Okay some small exhibits have taken place.  I was mentioning this one.  The California black legislators [California Legislative Black Caucus] had asked us to do a small exhibit for Black History Month in Sacramento [California] and it's the museum where at that time the first lady Schwarzenegger [Maria Shriver] that was her, her baby. And so we did--they wanted it for a month and then they asked can they keep it longer because the attendance was really going and everybody really, really loved it and stuff, so we did that.  And then we did an event down at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California] for their Black Alumni Association, their fundraising event.  They normally would have a big dinner and they wanted to do something different and have it in the auditorium so they did something similar to What You Learned in High School History [sic. What You Didn't Learn in High School History] but they actually--and they had a small exhibit, some, some--well how I'm gonna say, some prints around campus, not the originals, but had some prints and stuff around campus. And then they had the president of the university introduce us and that was very good and had a big reception.  They had about twelve hundred people in the auditorium that night. And they gave the book ['The Kinsey African American Art and History Collection'] out as, as--your, your ticket, bought you the book too; so the book went home with a lot of people that day (laughter) also.
Story_ID: 650255
Speaker 1: And then from there, we rested for a little bit more after that; and last year--what is this, this is '13 [2013] last year, '12 [2012]--I, I always tell Khalil [Khalil Kinsey] he's the one started all this stuff 'cause I say he's the reason we started the historical stuff in the first place and then the third grade history report and all that. But the NAACP Image Awards we were at the dinner afterwards, the after party and he's looking for somewhere to sit down with his plate and he and his buddies sit down at the Wells Fargo [Wells Fargo and Company] table and nobody's there and Wells Fargo folks come along and say, "No, no you can stay, you don't have to move."  So they say, they start talking to him and he tells them what he's doing, blah, blah and tell them about us and the say, "Oh yeah we know about the Kinsey Collection [Kinsey African American Art and History Collection]." And they say, "Well are your parents here? We'd love to meet them."  They did and it was two ladies from San Francisco [California] and so here we are and Bernard's [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] always inviting people to the house.  He says, "What time you leaving tomorrow? Why don't y'all just come on by the house on the way to the airport?"  So they did and got here and started seeing things and stuff and they said, "You know what, we're looking for something to do."  They had, they had supported 'Red Tails' like the year before and so they said this year for '13 [2013] they were looking for something to support for the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and the fiftieth anniversary of the March on Washington. And they said, "You know your exhibit would be really well to do.  We don't know what we're gonna do with it.  Well let's just talk about it."  So it took a while and they brought people from back east and everything and they decided they wanted to tour it for a year and take it to three black museums.  So San Francisco in February 'til May then it went to Charlotte, North Carolina, until October and now it's in--that was the Harvey Gantt museum [Harvey B. Gantt Center for African American Arts and Culture, Charlotte, North Carolina] which was interesting too because Harvey Gantt was the first black mayor there. And then now it's in Baltimore [Maryland] at the Reginald Lewis Museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History and Culture] which is really interesting too.  And so then we lead into March.  Now they too had also made their version of the Kinsey Collection book ['The Kinsey African American Art and History Collection'] that they give out to their clients.  So what they do, they'll--the exhibits there but they'll have us come and make a presentation to their--they'll have a big reception for their wealthy clients because they want us to make a presentation about legacy and all that kind of stuff and how we started. And then they'll have there are affinity groups maybe come in or--it's, it's just been fascinating frankly working with them.  They've been a great partner.  They have, in promoting the exhibit, they've come out with if you're a Wells Fargo customer, you can go in and get a credit card with one of three images from the Kinsey Collection [Kinsey African American Art and History Collection] on your credit card (laughter) personalized art in your wallet.  They also have four YouTube videos 'cause they're going after a younger clientele. So they have four celebrity videos where these four people talk about images from the Kinsey Collection and it's on YouTube and it's been seen by you know I think three something million people so far now.  And, and what, what it started, it would start other people blogging about it was called Untold Stories, the Untold Stories--Kinsey Untold Stories.  But other people now are blogging about their own personal untold stories because that's what you want people to do.  You know you want them to identify with this and there's something in everybody's family, everybody's history; and so it's been, it's been really good.  Now in the meantime--
Story_ID: 650256
Speaker 1: The exhibit in, in Charlotte--not in Charlotte [North Carolina] in Baltimore [Maryland] is gonna stay there until March 2nd now.  It originally was gonna close on the 20th of January but it's gonna be there until March.  And at the same time we have a small exhibit at Epcot, the American Pavilion [American Adventure Pavilion] at Epcot in Walt Disney World [Walt Disney World Resort] in Orlando, Florida, which is right now gonna be there for three years.  They have asked us to extend for five which is what we're considering right now.  That has been just one of the most amazing things ever.  This is the first time they've ever done anything like this.  The gallery space where it is they've always gotten images from museums.  They've gotten stuff from the Smithsonian [Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C.] from other museums and never anything that was connected like they had Jackie Robinson's bat, they had Abe Lincoln's [President Abraham Lincoln] hat, they had something from Mrs. Parks [Rosa Parks], but always things that were never connected.  So in 2008, '09 [2009] when the exhibit was in Florida, was when someone from Disney first came to see it, a friend actually, came to see it and he went back talking about it and told folks you know this is something we need to look at and so it's taken that time and it's come to 2013 so Wells Fargo [Wells Fargo and Company] opened February 8th in San Francisco [California], Disney opened March 8th in Orlando.  So this year has been like crazy 'cause we get to go down there and do tours with folks and talk to people and just kind of--the title of that one is 'Rediscovering America: Treasured Items from the Kinsey Collection' [sic. 'Rediscovering America: Family Treasures from the Kinsey Collection'] and they've done a little different, different take on it. They have five cases and it's, it's hope, courage, belief, imagination and heritage and each case has something in there that will inspire hope, or that will inspire belief or courage or whatever and Khalil [Kinsey's son, Khalil Kinsey] actually worked very strong with them kind of getting that done. And for them they have voices also describing what's in the case and had a little iPad thing that kids can do to give--so they can ask questions and stuff. And they have a little lantern that you turn on and hear this voice.  Well the first one is hope and it's about Phyllis Wheatley.  Well Ms. Whoopi Goldberg [HistoryMaker Whoopi Goldberg] talks about Ms. Phyllis Wheatley.  The next one you go to I think is belief and Ms. Diane Sawyer talks about belief.  Then you move to courage and imagination and you've got Chandra Wilson from 'Grey's Anatomy' and James Pickens [James Pickens, Jr.] from 'Grey's Anatomy' and they talk about those two cases.  Then you move on to heritage and heritage by the way has some personal items of ours in the exhibit.  One I talked about, we talked about Bernard's dad [Ulysses B. Kinsey] and I should have showed that picture downstairs. So they have an image of him in the case because--I'll back up a little bit on that.  Dad, in the early '40s [1940s], dad and other black teachers in Florida sued the State of Florida for equal pay and also for black kids to go to school the same calendar year as white kids.  Well, Thurgood Marshall was their attorney and some of those--and they won and he was with the Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.] then within the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] so but some of those led up to the Brown versus Board of Education, 1954 [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954]. So we talk about that, you know, we talk about dad and stuff. So that's in there. And then when they when they visited here they saw my grandmother's sewing machine.  They wanted to know what it meant to me.  So I described that to them and told them how mama made all our clothes.  We couldn't try on clothes, and all that. So they asked if they could have that in the collection.  Now initially I had so no and then I thought about it and I said you know they're gonna use her full name in that, they're going to--I have younger cousins who--I mean they never knew their great-great-grandmother you know and they're there and they'll see this.  They'll get to see this. And so I said yes.  So mama's sewing machine is at Disney World (laughter) on display for the world to see.  Her name Susie Plummer Pooler is there and Ms. Kerry Washington from 'Scandal' fame is the one who describes that case.  So she says my grandmother's name and she says my name and my grandmother's name.  So now that's really something.  Now they haven't--we don't get like with the museums and stuff, it's very different from working with the museums. With museums we get to understand what the attendance has been you know, kind of age group, how many kids are coming all that stuff, you don't get that with them.  But the fact that they're asking to extend it already means that it's going well. And we've been down there enough to see people coming in and out and stuff and all it's just, it's fascinating. And then for it to be in our home state is something else that's really, really something. And let's see we opened that weekend it was Steve Harvey has his Dreamers Academy [Disney Dreamers Academy] and so it was like a hundred black kids from across the country there and so we were involved in that and then they're gonna do that each year so we'll go back again to do that.  Then we were down with the national black journalists association [National Association of Black Journalists].  We were there with them at Epcot.  What were we there for here recently?  Oh and this last weekend, Ms. Goldberg was there and she was doing the candlelight ceremony for Disney for the two nights; and so they wanted us to come down and walk through the exhibit with her and you know discuss it and doing the whole thing, so it was fascinating, fascinating.
Story_ID: 650257
Speaker 1: So all this is what's been going on with us.  All this--I mean publications, magazines, 'Tavis Smiley Show' ['The Tavis Smiley Show']. (Laughter) I'm just throwing out a few things that's been happening.
Speaker 2: Now as--has there been a documentary discussed or made yet?
Speaker 1: You know what will happen is somebody will always say, "You guys need to do a documentary." And we'll say, "Yes, yes, yes we do." But it can't be you guys need to you know need a documentary you know we been doing--most of what we been doing so far has been, you know, us kind of doing it really I mean you know the thing with Wells Fargo [Wells Fargo and Company] obviously they're you know taking care of expenses and paying for the museums to do all this stuff and all. But to do documentary is quite an undertaking and not quite something that we're set to do.  There're been some video of Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] doing and us doing the, What You Didn't Learn in High School History and so we've often said maybe that, but it's never the quality that you would need for it to be--you know, it could be part of a documentary or something or whatever but I mean not to be like a full thing, you know. So we'll see, we'll see, we'll see where it goes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The blessings keep coming and so maybe that'll be one.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's gonna be one.
Speaker 1: Yeah. There'll be one (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I can almost guarantee it's gonna be one.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Story_ID: 650258
Speaker 1: To be honest with you, it has been--it is something I never ever would have thought that we would be doing, you know, now; and our friends who are retiring now keep saying, "But you guys are still working?"  We say, "No, but it's not really work."  It's like we're enjoying this you know.  And to have Khalil [Kinsey's son, Khalil Kinsey] to be involved in it now is what--to be honest with you without his involvement we would not be able to do it because he's become, he's become more the curator now and working with the museum folks.  So he goes in advance and he's there when it gets unboxed to make sure that it's in the condition it's supposed to be in and how it's gonna be hung and the story that it tells you know because one museum before we got involved we went and they kind of just hung stuff literally.  I mean it was beautiful and all but it just wasn't--it was no rhyme or reason sort of. And we--when we go in we always wanna make sure that the portrait of us and the portrait of Khalil are right together and they had hung--there is an image of a painting of a young lady they have in the exhibit and they hung that right next to ours and we said, no but we don't have a daughter.  We need--this is a family here.  This needs to be you know people need to see this this way.  So his involvement and his involvement with Disney [Walt Disney World Resort, Orlando, Florida] has been incredible because they--where in the museums will do a report, a condition report on their end and then when it gets packed again, but with Disney they come here first before it ever gets packed at all.  They wanna you know check off everything and so it's been, it's been wonderful it's been really wonderful.  They're quite different as I said from the museum but it's been just the fact that you never would have thought that.  Matter of fact, the young lady who's shepherding this through basically said she said, "You just don't know how many times this fell out and we had to put it back in and it fell out again and put it back in," she said, "because there are some people who would not want to see this happen."  But they were overruled or whatever and it's, it's there.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It's there.
Speaker 2: Now do you have something bigger planned or something--?
Speaker 1: Well you know we get asked that a lot here now.  To be honest with you we said that after Wells Fargo [Wells Fargo and Company] right now we could probably just rest for a little while. Because, because we get involved you know it's--and, and to be honest, some museums don't necessarily wanna work with collectors because we get involved.  They'd much have it be, you know, stuff from just the museum and so on and so on but what happens is we get involved, attendance goes up, membership goes up at the museum, books get sold because the museum will buy books from us but then they get to sell them at their profit and stuff and all. And so it just, it makes sense and then we enjoy doing it.  I mean to be able to have--to be in the museum when the kids come in there, and, and you know sometimes they don't wanna be there and then you kind of win them over you know and you see the questions they ask and stuff, I mean it's amazing, it's amazing. And then we get to go out to schools and speak at schools and stuff you know.  Khalil's voice gets heard a lot now because young people wanna know you know--and he'll, with adults, he'll say you know, "I grew up with this.  I didn't appreciate it when I was growing up with it."  He says, "I'm learning more now." And he'll tell you, he'll tell young people, he says, you know, "I can, I stand taller now."  He says, "Because I know where I came from.  I know I can navigate this black male thing now," you know.  He says and it's, it's fascinating, it's just, it's fascinating, it truly, truly is.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I said Mama's [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] up there looking down saying you done good girl.
Story_ID: 650259
Speaker 1: Is there any particular piece that's your favorite?  That's probably an unfair question.
Speaker 2: It is unfair.  That's like your favorite child.  But there are, there are a few.  There's, there's one in particular that comes to mind is is a Florida artist.  I never had a chance to meet him because he died before I ever collected his work really. His name is Hughie Lee-Smith and it's of a little girl and she's standing, the house is torn down, she's standing and her back, you only see her back, house is torn down.  I always say if my house was torn down, that's what it would look it like. And she's looking out, and it, it appears that she's jumping rope, I say she's jumping rope.  Some other interpretation was it looked like a rainbow halo kind of around her or something, but I think she's jumping rope. Her pigtails are flying and I say it's me.  She's looking out, you don't know what she's looking at 'cause there's nothing in the distance I say but she knows she's going somewhere (laughter).  She has a vision out there I say so that's one of my favorites.  The other one that's my favorite is I love the one of Khalil [Kinsey's son, Khalil Kinsey] obviously.  But the one young man's name is Samuel Dunson [Samuel L. Dunson, Jr.] and it's kind of a stylized version it's supposed to be me and Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] and Khalil. And it shows Khalil in the middle and he's reading 'The Prophet' by Kahlil Gibran and we're standing in like a field of books. And so the young man who did the work we saw him--we met him in Savannah [Georgia] he was at the school of art and design there [Savannah College of Art and Design, Savannah, Georgia], and we liked his style and so we just commissioned him to do a piece.  Didn't know what it was gonna be, spent about an hour talking with him.  He came back with it two years later, told us he couldn't charge us for it because it was his gift to us and said that he saw us as cultivators of knowledge.  He named the piece 'The Cultivators' and he said, "Try to impart wisdom to young people."  That painting was done in 2002 before we ever thought about anything being exhibited you know.
Speaker 1: It's got Bernard Kinsey with the hat right?
Speaker 2: Right, that's it, um-hm, um-hm.  That piece gets noticed more than anything else in there literally.
Speaker 1: That's a strong--
Speaker 2: That's a strong piece.  He's come to several of the openings and stuff and he brought his parents and his kids. At, at the Reginald Lewis Museum [Reginald F. Lewis Museum of Maryland African American History and Culture, Baltimore, Maryland] right now it's a, it's a--they have this huge, tall as this wall about as wide as that, but a huge piece I think I can get you the images right now and that's what's on the side of the building to advertise the exhibit coming.  It's one of the images that Wells [Wells Fargo and Company] is using for the credit card.  You can choose that one.  When we were in West Palm Beach [Florida] they did a billboard of it.  They even made, they had one sign that was made of oh like a--I bet it's not plastic. Like a plasterized fabric or whatever and like you use on banners and so it was only the one piece.  So what they did was they had it cut down and they had like, oh like a computer bag made out of it you know so you only get one image though you just get one of them has like Bernard's face on it and one's mine and one's Khalil (laughter). But just you know the idea of they--and then they made a lot of little small things and stuff out of rest of the material, it's really interesting.
Speaker 1: Are there any full prints available in that piece?
Speaker 2: No.  I can give you you know like a postcard kind of size that kind of thing and all but no.  And people have asked us that too.  They said, "Well do you, do you sell any of this?  Do you do any prin- any images you know blow them up and have prints made," and we just haven't done it.  Just haven't done--I know.  Folks have been asking too.

Speaker 1: They like that one, they like, they like us, the one of us. [HistoryMaker] Artis Lane did our portrait.  I think she's a HistoryMaker, I know she's a HistoryMaker.
Speaker 2: Right.  I interviewed Artis Lane (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: She's--
Speaker 1: You did her.
Speaker 2: She's the, she painted the official portrait of Ronald Regan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan].
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, yes.  She's done--
Speaker 2: From Canada originally.  Artis Lane.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah you know her.  She--the one of Khalil [Khalil Kinsey] she painted in 1991 that was a gift to us when Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] left Xerox [Xerox Corporation], retired from Xerox, the Xerox black employee caucus.  We knew her and had been friends with her over the years but and always loved her work but just didn't know if we--probably would have had--and I bought her sculptures but no paintings and so they talked to her and they really liked her work and so she said, "Oh I know he would love a portrait of his son.  I would love to paint Khalil."  So that's what they did. And then the one of us that she painted was in 2002 also, 2002 yeah.  For our thirty-fifth year wedding anniversary and college friends and a friend of ours in Oakland [California], they own a gallery there commissioned her to paint the one of the two of us as a gift.  So those are all very special too because they you know and we were the first couple that she ever painted and so she and she knew us and she wanted to hear, she wants to hear your voice or if it's a video whatever while she's painting.  Since then two of our friends, two couples have commissioned her to do them. So now she's--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, she's great.
Speaker 1: She is.  She's fabulous, fabulous.  I've gotta call her too.  I'll tell her we talked about her today.  I have to give her a buzz.  I just saw her about two weeks ago.  Yeah, I need to call her--
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and talk to her.
Story_ID: 650261
Speaker 1: So do you see yourself and--well, well Khalil [Khalil Kinsey] will be working with this project for a time to come I suppose (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's been able to--Khalil--I said he's a writer, so he's been able to, to write all the--and how he got started was--well he was with us all the time, but he really wasn't--because the museums were doing it and stuff and all. But when we did the book we were working with an editor and she's very good from the Huntington museum [Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens, San Marino, California] here but she's very academic. And we kept saying no, we don't quite say it like that.  We want--it's gotta be our voice.  So we, we literally hired Khalil to come in and say okay work with her and make sure it's us talking you know in the book. And so that's what he was able to do and it came you know it came out very well.  And she's pleased with it too. But just the idea that we didn't want it to sound so academic you know what I mean? Because it's us talking. And that was his first real involvement and then after that he started saying, "You know mom you don't need to do so and so and so," and, "Mom y'all need to (unclear)" and had all these ideas and stuff we said, "Why don't you work with the people then."  And so and he did and it's been, it's been--he's as a matter of fact when he was in Baltimore [Maryland] they said they were surprised, the director came in one day he said, "I came in there," and he said, "and Khalil got his jeans on and a paintbrush in his hand and he's in there painting."  Khalil said, "Well that's what I'm here for."  He said, "I'm not here just to stand around and supervise.  I'm here to help.  I mean if I need to hang it up I'll help hang."  'Cause we did a small exhibit over at Pepperdine [Pepperdine University, Malibu, California], you know, we both got our master's [degree] from Pepperdine.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Um-hm and so--
Speaker 1: That's right around the corner?
Speaker 2: --right around the corner.  Yeah well when we went there it was in the neighborhood, it wasn't, it wasn't there.  But we did a small exhibit there September, yeah but just historical stuff.  And Khalil went to help you know set everything up and all and he wound up actually having to hang the show because school hadn't started yet and the art department folks weren't in yet.  And they wanted it up when school started so he said okay. So he hired a buddy to come in there with him and they actually had to hang, yeah hang the images.
Speaker 1: So, so Khalil is set to keep the project moving forward?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah he's asked us here the other day, he said, "Okay now guys, what are we gonna do with this now?  Are we still going back out on the road so to speak or do I need to start doing," so we got some figuring out to do frankly.  I don't see stopping right now.  Bernard [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] and I, we still travel a lot.  We have our personal travel.  We're gone 150 days a year sometimes frankly and now we're--our personal travel still we wanna do and then on top of you know the museum stuff it's gotten a little busy that's why we need to rest just a little bit a few months or so anyway because we got some, couple of big trips we want, we wanna take.
Story_ID: 650262
Speaker 1: Now when you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would differently if you could change something?
Speaker 2: (Pause)Khalil [Kinsey's son, Khalil Kinsey] would say I should've had another child.  I said, "Well that wasn't in the cards so that didn't, that didn't work out."  I guess so he would have somebody else to help him with stuff.  No, I just, I just, I just accept the blessings that have been flowing to be honest with you.  And, and I'd said earlier I just always think I always felt that God was gonna bless me in a way that I may not have ever anticipated at all, but he was gonna make sure mama [Kinsey's paternal grandmother, Susie Plummer Pooler] and everybody, everything mama and everybody did was gonna be inside of me and that was gonna, I was gonna be fine.  I was gonna be fine.  I'm not, I may get a little teary here now, any way I'm not as close to my dad [Eddie Pooler] as I would like to be.  You know that would be maybe one thing I would change.  Some of that's my, my fault and that's one I would change (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And he's still--
Speaker 2: He's still living yeah.  He lives in--he's in Jacksonville [Florida] right now with one of my sisters, the third one.  I'm first.  Yeah, I'm his first born he always says, "You're my first born."  Some things that still bother me with that from my side and from his side.  Never any idea, I don't think--I always knew he loved me but I just, I think, I think I could have left sometime you know and oh dear, which is part of why when I married Bernard [HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] I think I just absorbed his family because they're all very close and so holidays were spent there.  And, and my dad's--I've learned more about my dad through one of my nieces, his granddaughter, because she went to Florida A and M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida] she came out and stayed with us for a while and she basically grew up you know with him because her mother was divorced for a while. And so I've learned more about him through her which has been a blessing frankly and to know that he is, he's a good person.  He has a good family.  The family he raised they're all very good people.  I just don't spend holidays with them you know but they get together for holidays.  They invite me but I'm usually doing something else you know.  And over the last few--over the last ten years I guess we've gotten closer and of course he's getting older now and now I'm feeling like oh dear I should have done, I should have done, I should have so those are, so those are some of the things I would have done differently.  I would have spent a little bit more time, time yeah, visiting.  Always wanted him to come visit me.  He's telling me now that he would have flown but my, he said but my stepmom [Albertha Haire Pooler] didn't wanna fly.  She wouldn't fly.  But one of my sisters lived, the one right behind me, lived in Denver [Colorado] for a while but what she and her husband would do is, see they would fly down there, rent a van and then drive them back to Denver.  I said well I'm not doing that (laughter).  I can't do that.  I'll come visit you. (Laughter) You gotta fly out here to come see me or you're gonna have to take the train.  I'm just not--I can't drive cross country like that.  And so anyway that's, that's some of what I would do differently.
Story_ID: 650263
Speaker 1: I know you--through your work with the Kinsey Foundation [Bernard and Shirley Kinsey Foundation for Art and Education] you're, you're committed to intergenerational transmission of art and education--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Well one of the things and I--and I talk about this when I talk with young people is that because there is so much history among us or whatever, I tell y- I say to young people I need you to start using the technology that you have and record your grandparents, start interviewing them.  Find out even if you're just asking them what it was like when they were kids you know but start recording that.  If there are old pictures or anything around, start identifying them as much as possible, recording all that stuff.  There's so much that's lost because we don't talk about it and because we don't share it and because we don't know what it is.  Actually my [paternal] grandmother's Bible and my baby pictures and stuff all got lost that way because my dad [Eddie Pooler] took them--that's one reason I was mad with him too--my dad took the box, they moved several times, it was left on the sink somewhere and the sink leaked and the younger kids who didn't know what was all in there basically threw the box away and that's where my baby stuff was, my locks of hair in the Bible you know and all that kind of stuff and so it's important that we, that we keep that history alive.  And our kids don't know themselves at all because they don't know their history, they don't know their past.  I think I said earlier, the saying I heard about that we're the answer to the prayers of our ancestors, our kids truly are that and I, I just don't want that to get left behind and so that's, that's something I pray for really that our kids will get to know who they are and become empowered by the strength that's in them.  I mean when I think about our people having been able to do what they did with nothing you know, think about if we had not had those impediments in our way, how far ahead, how far ahead the world would be. America would be even a stronger place than it is now; and so that's kind of what I hope for the future, our young people--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because they're the ones.
Story_ID: 650264
Speaker 1: This is a question we always ask: what today would you consider your legacy?
Speaker 2: Oh, that's hard.  That--legacy meaning what I'm leaving behind here right?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: (Pause) I hope my legacy would be that I've worked hard to leave the world in a better place.  That I've worked hard to live the lessons that my [paternal] grandmother [Susie Plummer Pooler] taught me.  That I've worked hard to--this is terrible, I can't think. That I made an impact on somebody's life, that they've been able to learn through me or, or spend time with me.  I have a young lady that I've spent quite a bit of time with who I think is doing a wonderful job and if she does what I think she's gonna be able to do in her life I think it, it will be part of my legacy in a sense because the route that she's traveling is one that's very--it's hard but I think what's inside of her I've been able to help foster and so it would be good just to see that go on.  I'm sorry.  Part of my legacy I think too would be, I mentioned earlier my siblings and their, their children and they would be my nieces and nephews so they are the great-grandchildren of my grandmother so I would want them to be able to understand and know their grandmother through something I've done.  The idea that there are things that would be left behind I guess is part of a legacy too but only, only if they can demonstrate and show things that I've tried to do to foster an understanding of how people should be, really.  I mean when I think about trying to be the best person I can be--I mean and some of it's simple.  You know trying to be kind to someone, trying to be respectful, being helpful, sharing whatever it is that you have, having a relationship with God.  All of these things, even though they're simple they're things that make you who you are and make me who I am and I just think that those are things that have helped me get to where I am now, or be who I am now; and I think that's all been good.
Story_ID: 650265
Speaker 1: Now is there anything I haven't asked you about that we need to talk about before I ask my last question?
Speaker 2: Uh-oh you have another question? The last one--(laughter) I thought the, thought the legacy one was the last one.  Well you haven't asked me this question but one of the things that--you just tell me if you want this to be on there. One of the things I've always, when I talk to kids, I always want them to understand that because they wanna know what--'cause somebody even said to us once about, "Well I'm glad you had a job that gave you--paid enough money that you can buy all this stuff," and I want people, I want kids to understand that it's not about buying, it's not about having money to do this. It's about working for something because this didn't just happen.  You know, it's a process, it's forty years of this you know.  And, and where we live didn't just happen.  You know it's work, it's hard work and so I want kids to understand that because it doesn't, it means that things don't happen overnight and you're not just given.  I talk about the blessings and stuff but the blessings I think come because I'm able to receive because I'm able to give.  And so I, and like I always tell the kids, you know, they wanna think that you're famous or something or whatever and I say, "We're not athletes, we're not entertainers, we're not--we're just regular working people who've been able to do this." And that's, that's one thing I wanna have understood to be honest with you.  Because I guess I don't want anybody to think I'm hoity toity so to speak, you know what I mean.  It's--I'm my grandmother's child. I'm who I am because of her.
Story_ID: 650266
Speaker 1: The last question is similar to legacy, but a little bit different.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Ma'am, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Oh, (laughter) didn't I just say that?
Speaker 1: In a way but we always ask it two ways (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I want to be remembered simply.  I really do, simply, simply, because I really do consider myself a fairly simple person.  I'm not complex at all.  I really don't need the hoopla and the attention.  Some of the things we didn't talk about and I should just say is--I talked about saving money and stuff and all, but I saved money, I save money because there's a check that's coming in that gets saved, but I also saved because I don't have to go get my nails done every week.  I don't have to have the bling, bling.  I cut my own hair.  I do my own hair.  I cut Bernard's [Kinsey's husband, HistoryMaker Bernard Kinsey] hair.  I don't need all this stuff you know what I mean? And so when I say I'm a simple person, I can, I have a lot of stuff, things, but I can do without, I can life a simpler life and so I wanna be--I would like to be remembered as, as just being a kind person, a person who, who thought about other people.  A person who could--I feel like I can put myself in somebody else's shoes and I'd like to be remembered that way.  You respect me, I respect you.  I can understand where you're coming from.  A lot of it because I've been there you know.  As I said earlier I mean I didn't grow up with--but one thing my--and I'm out of sequence here--but one thing I have a friend who lives here who was in high school in St. Augustine [Florida] up until tenth grade and she reminds me she says, "Shirley [HistoryMaker Shirley Kinsey] you know you always special."  I said, "What do you mean?"  She says, "Your [paternal] grandmother [Susie Plummer Pooler] made you spe- made sure you knew you were special." And I'd say, "How?"  She said, "Because you came to school with roast beef sandwiches and sliced chicken sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and we had bologna sandwiches."  Now to me I was thinking well I'm eating leftovers from Sunday dinner you know, but that made--to her, that made me special, you know what I mean? And so it's that kind of, that kind of stuff that's here.  And I, I (pause) yeah.
