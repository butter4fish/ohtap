Evan Faulkenbury: Okay. Today is January 23, 2015. My name is Evan Faulkenbury with the Southern Oral History Program at UNC-Chapel Hill and today I'm interviewing Evelyn Poole-Kober. That's how you say your name, right?        Evelyn Poole-Kober: Correct.         EF: Thanks for agreeing to be here. First to begin, please tell me about where you were born and your family.        EPK: I was born in Lincoln County. It's northwest of Charlotte. Mecklenburg County. My parents were Grover and Angie Poole and I was the third daughter born to them. My oldest sister, Betty Jean Poole, is Betty Sigmann now and [the] second daughter was Dorothy Jean Poole and she died when she was fifteen. She had a brain hemorrhage when she was playing softball, running around the bases. Then I was the next. My next sister is Martha Jane Poole and she's Martha Mackey now. Then my two brothers were born, Grover Emmitt Poole and Randy Carol Poole. So they were my brothers and sisters and we grew up on a farm in Lincoln county. My father and mother bought these two adjoining farms. One was Mullins farm and one was Bollinger farm. The house there that I grew up in, my parents were the second owners of that house, so it was built by the Bollinger family.         My father also bought and cut timber. He had a sawmill that he would take into the woods where he bought the timber or was cutting the timber and set the equipment down. Then they would take the cut timber to the lumberyard. I'm not sure where he sold it, but I think it was McClure Lumber in Charlotte, Mecklenburg County. He hired a lot of men returning from the war. He did that for a long time, and then he started the dairy farm. I'm not quite sure when they started the dairy farm, but I remember that they built a beautiful barn that you would see in Progressive Farmer or the Progressive Journal, those country magazines that we used to get. He bought the cows and built a dairy farm. I think he was continuing to--. He did the cutting and buying and selling of timber a long time after that, but he had a couple of men who had a couple of houses on this property that he rented--I don't think he rented. He had two families that lived in these houses that he maintained for them, and they helped on the farm with harvesting the grain and making silage for the silos and whatever needed to be done on the farm and helping with the dairy apparatus. My mom also worked with milking the cows, and we sold our milk to Biltmore Dairies. They kept the dairy farm until I went away to college and then they decided to--well, I've left out a bit of my childhood, my life, there.         As children we all worked on the farm at jobs that we were able to do. We were always instructed on how to do the job and ask questions if we didn't quite understand. One of the jobs that I did in the dairy farm was before going to school, I had to climb these silos and throw down silage for the morning milking routine for the cows. Then I had to feed the baby calves that were born and there was a routine for that. You had to teach them how to drink out of a bucket. It was a bucket with a big nipple on it to match their mom&#8217;s. To teach them you might have to put your finger in their mouth and get it to them. It wasn't a big thing. I loved my baby calves. As a result I never could eat some of the meat that is now the meat that is nothing but baby calf. So that was my chore before and after school.  I had to be done regardless of whether I was going to play basketball or any other activity that was going on, so when I was in high school, I would joke that I came in the front door and going out the backdoor putting on my work clothes. You didn't have so much time if you had a ballgame to play. Whatever time you're getting out of school and you've got these other things to do, so, there were no excuses. You did those things, unless you were sick. The only times that I didn't have to climb that silo were if I was sick or if it was raining.        EF: This is from the earliest you remember as a child?        EPK: Well, by the time I was old enough to do it, I was probably in my teens when I started that. So there were no excuses. But if it was a rainy day, a helper did it or if I were sick. In the summer time we did whatever was being done. Like making hay, harvesting grain. So we were always in the field working. Cutting corn for silage. When we were harvesting grain, it would be oats and rye and barley, because we didn't really grow a lot of wheat. We have a combine that you had to actually ride on it and grain came out into sacks that were on there. So this was one of my jobs in the summertime was riding this combine and tying these sacks and getting it off on the ground and making sure--you always had to have the sack where the grain was coming out. My dad, he could really rip through these fields on that tractor, but he was always very patient with me if there was an issue because he's always looking back where we're sitting. He was always very patient. I remember one time that I actually, I think as a result of drinking too much water one time and got sick, I remember him carrying me out of the field. I'm sure drawn across his shoulder to the truck and taking me home. I had to rest the whole afternoon. We worked hard, but he understood. He was very loving. I can remember he carrying me out of the field and I was probably fourteen, fifteen, maybe sixteen years old. But we were always driving the vehicles around. Making hay, my dad would do the bailing of the hay with the bailers and they shot the bails off into the field, where it came out of the bailer onto the field. But then someone had to throw them up on a wagon and stack them and then we took them to the barn. I usually just drove the tractors. I never did do that manual labor type of lifting from the field to the trailer. This is some time later on, and I will skip up to that, to say that we did have a death in our family and we did get behind with bailing, but at that time we did have three bailers on the farm and my brother asked me to [inaudible], because they were expecting rain--this was after the funeral and everything.        EF: This was your sister?
EPK: No, that was many years later.        EF: Oh I see.        EPK: No. I can't remember who. It may have been my uncle. I can't remember who had died in my family. But we had three bailers running in this one field and my brother asked me if I would drive one and my niece would drive one, a tractor, to ride bails, and he would drive one. And I said, "Okay, I can do that." This was way later on. I was an adult living here in our town when this happened and I said, "Yeah, I can do that." I knew how to do it. You have to keep the bailer where the windrow is. But this is the funny part of the story, I had on this straw hat and my brother and his son are on my trailer to stack the hay. Actually, it was straw. It wasn't hay. It was straw. And I turned my head to be sure my bailer was in the right, that I'm on the windrow correctly, and a little puff of wind came along and caught my hat and it bailed it up. So we laughed. My nephew about fell off the wagon laughing that I lost my hat in the bail of hay or straw. So that was probably the last time that I actually did anything like that working on the farm that I can remember. But when we were in high school--. I go back because I really did jump way ahead. When I was in high school, while we were in school in the summertime we didn't have jobs at Belk or what local, at that time I'm not sure if we even had fast food, but we worked on the farm. We didn&#8217;t really get allowances, but if we needed money for something, we just asked for it. And usually if I'd say that we wanted to go the movies and we needed whatever the ticket prices were, we always were able. We got more than we ever asked for. When I was in high school also, I drove a school bus. In North Carolina, then, students could drive school buses. I drove two years. I drove as a substitute bus and one year I had my own bus. We got paid twenty some dollars a month and that was my extra spending money, and also it helped me with my band expenses. I was in the band so it helped me pay for whatever. We didn&#8217;t have exaggerated things like they have today, but we did have a nice little band. Then I worked several years before going to college and saved my money, and went to Lenoir-Rhyne and majored in education there and went through school in three years. I went to school fulltime and went to summer school because I wanted to finish up in three years, so I did.        EF: Let me pause you if I can and I'll definitely come back and revisit your college education, but I wanted to ask a little bit more about your childhood growing up on the farm.        EPK: Okay.        EF: It sounded like the way you're detailing it, the farm meant a great deal to you growing up. Can you talk a bit more about how important was it that you grew up on a farm and rural life in North Carolina?        EPK: One of the nice things about growing up on the farm, as I looked back it [was] more than how I looked at it at the time, but I especially thought about this when I went away to college and even more recently is that, we had the opportunity to grow up with our parents, and that they were always there and it wasn't one of those things where we had to wonder if our parents loved us. We knew they loved us. Growing up on the farm gave us that opportunity to learn from our parents the importance of taking care of land. One of the things I remember my dad saying as we were growing up was that we need to take care of the land because there wasn't anymore being made. So I grew up more environmentalist and conservationist than I ever thought about it being that. But that's the way we grew up. To take care.         We also grew with the knowledge that--and it wasn't something that was pointed out--I think growing up on a farm gave me the opportunity to know that anything that was to be done, I could do on the farm regardless of my sex. I mean, my dad never once said, "You can't do this because you're a girl." It was always, "You can do this when you're old enough or strong enough." I think that made me more aware of equal rights for opportunities. It also was a time where we didn't have to worry so much about safety being outside, or walking through the woods to visit another family on a day when we didn't have much to do or a holiday or something. I can remember walking from our house through these woods to another farm to another farm because there was a pathway, or there may have been a road that people used for harvesting or something, but we knew the way. You may have to cross over a creek or something. But my parents, once we were old enough, they didn't send us off when we four or five years old, but when we were teenagers, we could walk these places without worrying whether we might be attacked or anything bad happen to us. We were allowed to do those things, but also we knew we were responsible for getting ourselves back home. And this was way before cell phones. We could walk on the highway. The roads were not paved. You could do things more freely and without worrying. And you knew all the neighbors. They may be the neighboring farm and they may be a half a mile down the road, but you knew. You went to school with these people, with the children of these families.         And one of the things that happened when I was in high school, at that time there was a lot of cotton being grown and harvested. Schools might be let out at noon for people to pick cotton, for their children to pick cotton, for the farmer's children to get home and pick cotton, and we didn't have cotton on the farm. Once my dad went into really dairy farming, one of the tenant farmers, he did have an older couple that lived in this house off the road through the pasture to their house. It was an older couple, and they lived there for the remainder of their life without farming or paying rent or anything, they were such good people. My dad and mom--they had children that looked after them, but they lived there. They had grown cotton and my parents&#8217; families had grown cotton, but once he had the dairy farm and the cotton field was a higher elevation than the pasture that adjoined it, he decided to stop growing cotton because he didn't want to spray DDT, and he didn't want it to flow or migrate into the pasture fields. He quit growing cotton on the farm. So that was one of the things that I can remember. As children, what we would do, we didn't have cotton and I hated picking cotton. It tore up my fingers.         EF: Sure.        EPK: But because it was so much fun to go down to your neighbors, and you'd get paid a little, you'd have a little cotton bag tied around your waist and you'd go down where your neighbor's were growing cotton, so you walked down there with your cotton sack and pick cotton with them. You may have a line of rows and you'd have twelve people. We'd sing songs and carry on and have a--. I was not there to make money. I never picked one hundred pounds in a day. But it was fun. It was a fun thing. Another fun thing that we did as children, when farmers grew lots of corn and they would let it dry in the field. For picking the corn off the stalks--. This was even before corn pickers. Where they harvested the corn. But they would pick this corn and they would get it back to their farm and close their barn and where their corncribs were, they would have it in a row. So then, as we were teenagers, we would go from farm to farm in the fall. I'm talking about cold weather, where they would have corn shuckings. So you'd go and you'd sit with your friends, maybe your boyfriend, or somebody you weren't dating, somebody you were sweet on, and have a good time. We went from farm to farm doing that and we had it at our farm too. So it's a big nighttime event.         EF: Draws in a lot of community members.        EPK: It was just community. All the farmers around. So you know you're going to have your corn shucking, you'd just go--. I remember my granddad was alive then. I think he might take his horse and wagon. They had cars, but he might want to take his horse and wagon to these farms saying, "We're having a corn shucking at our house." So all the farmers let you know when they were going to have their corn shucking, so you could go to at least a half of a dozen. We'd have ours. Sometimes the women in the family would cook food and they would have more of a meal, but most people would give away fruit and candy. Stick candy or some nice little candy for the children and the teenagers. So that was our entertainment growing up on a farm. In those days, that was our entertainment.        EF: About what decade was this?        EPK: Well, I graduated high school in 1957.        EF: Okay.        EPK: So this was--.        EF: Late 1940s. Early 1950s.         EPK: 1940s. Early 1950s. More the 1950s than the 1940s.         EF: Okay. Sure. I wanted to ask also a bit more about your mother and father. Did they also, were they originally from Lincoln County? Or did they grow up somewhere else?        EPK: They were from Lincoln County, but their parents were tenant farmers. So they didn't inherit farmland, but that's when my dad had this saw mill, that my brother still owns it and uses it. So that's how they worked and saved their money to do this. To buy these farms.        EF: Okay.        EPK: But no, they grew up, their parents grew up as tenant farmers, and their children grew up as tenant farmers. But they were from Lincoln County.        EF: Did you have a relationship with your grandparents growing up?        EPK: I did! On my mother's side and on my dad's side. My mother's family, my grandparents on my mother's side, they lived with her brother and his wife. My mother only had a brother, she didn't have a sister. So the grandparents lived with them. We would visit with them a lot. Then my dad's parents, my dad had built, after he and my mom were more or less settled with the dairy farm, he built his mother and daddy a nice house. They were living in an old farmhouse on the farm, but he built them a nice house. He basically took care of them for the rest of their life. So yes, we always had relationships with them. My granddaddy, we called him Pawpul, he was a real picker. He liked to pick. My grandmother was not so much a picker, but my granddaddy was. He liked to pick on the children. He liked to be around. After he died, when my sister died, my grandmother on my mom's side, my mom's mom died that year also, and my granddad. My granddad died. My sister, my granddad, and then my grandmother. My mother always said they grieved themselves to death over my sister. And they were very sad about it. I can remember when they both died. I was in sixth grade, seventh grade.        EF: Ahh. You were very young.        EPK: My grandmother lived sometime after my grandfather lived and my grandmother. Both parents lived sometime after that. But I remember that. It was a sad time for us.        EF: Sure. And you don't have to answer if you don't want, but can you tell me more about those circumstances about the deaths in the family and how they affected you growing up?        EPK: Well, my sister Betty and she were really close and they were in high school together. They were playing softball, it was apart of physical ed. It's what you did, you didn't have to stay after school, it was a part of your high school. And they were out, it was a nice February day and they were outside playing softball and she hit the ball, homerun, and was running around the bases and just fell over. I remember somewhat about that, but not a lot. I remember that I didn't know what was going on exactly. Although we had the dairy farm, my dad was working at what was this--I'm trying to figure how to name it--the man also had a real business of cutting timber and sawing up timber that was brought to him, and my dad had gone over to help him. He was doing some work for him running the sawmill. I don't think it was his own equipment over there, it was his. I remember I was still in school. I came home on the bus not knowing what was going on and my teachers had come for my dad and my mom and then they came home to tell us. And some of her very good friends came. Her closest friends came. It probably affected my sister, Betty, more because they were so close than me. It's not that it didn't affect me, it was just they were very close. My parents, she was always with my parents. She never grew old, so they had very fond memories of her. She had a fun personality. She loved sports. So those were the nice things that they remember. She worked on the farm too like we all did. So when they would later on talk about things she did, it was like some of the activities she was involved in. So memories for them were probably stronger than for me, but even today, we remember her by putting things on her grave. Special on the graves. We always talked about people in our family who had died. It's not like they were buried and were gone. So it was something that was always there but our family went on living is what I would like to say. Our family went on living. It was a sadness and, my parents, it affected them more than--. Parents don't expect to bury their children. For them it was really a sad time. But my dad and my mom were really strong people. We had this dairy farm, we had these cows that had to be milked twice a day and strangers couldn't do it. So they were having to do the daily things that they would have done regardless. So those kinds of things went on even when my sister died, when my grandfather died, and my grandmother died. It wasn't like you got a week off because you had a death in your family. That doesn't happen when you have an active farm, a working farm.         EF: Well, thank you for sharing. I appreciate that. I wonder, since we're still in that area of your childhood, could you tell me a bit about your education as a child. Going to school. Elementary school--.        EPK: Okay. We went to this--my first five years, my first five grades were in this elementary school called MacPillier. It was a two-room school building and it didn't have bathrooms. We had outdoor facilities.        EF: The outhouse.        EPK: The outhouse. It didn't have heat. We had those potbelly stoves. So we carried--. I have a picture of that. I look like a little raggedy muffin. It was in the first grade. You went dressed for the weather, so I remember in one of these pictures that I have, I have on little corduroy overalls, the long corduroy overalls with a little dress over them so it in todays world you're wearing stockings. Little leggings with the dress. Well these were corduroy overalls as leggings.        EF: It kept you warm.        EPK: It kept us warm. We had to walk to meet the school bus and we probably walked almost a mile.         EF: Twice a day.        EPK: Twice a day. You walked to meet the bus and you walked home. Now if it was bad weather, my dad came and picked us up at the school bus stop and took us to the school bus stop. So yes, we walked. Again, I'm saying you walked. You didn't have to worry about being picked up by some stranger wanting to give you candy on the way to the school bus.        EF: Right.         EPK: There were other people walking on that same road from our house. We walked through a couple of farm roads. Other children walked to this particular stop. So we had to carry our lunch. I'm sure there wasn't refrigeration. I don't remember what we took for lunch, but my mom probably made us a sandwich of some sort. One of the things that I remember, I always loved those little fig newtons, or fig bars.        EF: Oh, sure.        EPK: I only see them over at North Carolina State when I go over there for a class at the McKimmon Center in the little snack room that they have. They have those little fig bars. I always buy one. She would always put something like that in there and maybe some fruit and probably a sandwich of some kind, but I'm not sure. I'm sure we had plenty to eat. I'm sure she sent plenty for us to eat. But again, we didn't have refrigeration. So we couldn't take something that's not going to--in the wintertime I guess it wouldn&#8217;t really matter, but in the summertime. Well, school was out in May anyway. Started up in October or late September. So we had first and second grade together. We had third, fourth, and fifth together. It was team teaching at its best. They taught the whole class together. I had Mrs. Sigmann. Mrs. Hoveson in the first and second grade and Mrs. Sigmann in third, fourth, and fifth grades. The thing about the teachers is--I never remember my teachers saying, &#8220;Well your sister Betty,&#8221; or Dot, her name was Dot, we called her Dot, they never--but when I came along and my younger sister and my two brothers, they would end up saying, &#8220;Well, you're not like Evelyn.&#8221; And so they didn't always like these teachers as much as I did. That was bad because we all have such different personalities in my family. So that's where I went for first through the fifth grade. The next school we were school bused to. We probably still walked. I'm not really sure when the bus started coming by our house. I don't remember that. It may have been when we went to--. I don't know. I should ask my sister Betty. She would know that. Eventually the bus came by our house. Betty actually drove the school bus, also. And my brothers did. My sister Martha didn't drive the bus, she didn't want to. The rest of us drove buses for our school but I can&#8217;t remember when it started coming by our house to pick us up. We walked that mile to school to catch the bus. We then went to Rock Springs school, which was sixth, seventh, and eighth and then high school. All in the same building.         EF: Okay. Sure.
EPK: I don't remember a lot of my schoolteachers there except more high school teachers. I had a Mrs. Hull who taught biology and the sciences. I had basketball with Mr. Carter. All the sports were Mr. Carter. Another Mrs. Sigmann taught business. Then I had a Mrs. Baker for English. I think they were my main teachers in high school. I don't remember a lot of my other teachers in the sixth and seventh grade. I should, probably, but I don't. But my high school teachers were Baker and Sigmann and Carter and Hull. Caldwell-Hull. She became a Hull. I think they were the main ones that I had. Mrs. Sigmann was also always the senior advisor. I'm trying to remember who our band teacher was. You know I can't even remember the band teacher's name. That's pretty bad.        EF: You remember a lot of names though. That is impressive.         EPK: I was on a thought there and I'm not sure what it was going to be.         EF: Oh I'm sorry.        EPK: Well that's okay. I'll get to it. In high school, Mrs. Sigmann, she was always senior advisor. We went to New York and Washington on the senior trip and that was a lot of fun. It was so funny. Your class was always the worst class she ever had. That was just her way. She loved us dearly but she would say towards the end of the year, "You are the worst senior class I've ever had." We had good students then. We didn't have bad things going on. I hear about some things when I go to class reunions that I didn't even know about. But we did have a high school principal who, I think he would probably be arrested now, his name was--well, let me go back to Mrs. Sigmann. When I was a junior, I was one of the class marshals, which was selected through grades. We did our own senior prom. The juniors did the prom and the sophomores were servers. We did them in gyms and we didn't have all of this all night stuff and we didn't go rent a great big auditorium. We would just decorate the gym and have a good time. So the juniors sponsored it for the seniors and the sophomores could be waiters. So we would have decorations and we had a good time without spending lots and lots of money. And then we went to New York, I said, and we went to Washington, DC and that was fun. She would be the annual advisor, so she would help you lie out the annual and get it together. So she was always good about that. I'm sorry I can't remember the band's name--the band director's name.         EF: No, that's totally fine.         EPK: But we went to the Charlotte thanksgiving parade. I can remember thinking, &#8220;Gah, it's so cold.&#8221; So we did that and that was fun. That sounds so tame, doesn't it? Compared to what you hear today. I do hear some stories. I heard a couple at the last couple of class reunions.        EF: Oh.        EPK: But one of our teachers, Mrs. Hamrick, she taught home economics, and I think she may have been one of our like--I can't remember, maybe junior class advisors. Anyway. At our last class reunion, unfortunately she had died before we had our last one, but one of my friends was Jerry Hicks. There were several men, young men, in the class. Some of us live close together. But we're always good friends. My school was in one little community here in this area and there was this community over here. So more of your friends were in your grade. But Jerry Hicks was actually not even in Lincoln County. He rode his bicycle to this intersection. I guess his parents got him going to school in Lincoln County. I'm not sure how that happened, but he got on at this one intersection. But he was telling us at one of these meetings. He went up to Mrs. Hamrick and he asked her did she remember when he and Jim Sheryl and Rodney locked her in the closet? She said yes, she still did not think it was funny. And this was a long time later. I said, "Jerry, you all did that? I don't even remember it." He also told a story--I was going to tell you about the principal.        EF: Oh yeah.        EPK: AC Little. We all laughed that if he wore that burgundy corduroy suit, he was on a tear that day. Just stand back. My sister, Betty, and I will say, "Boy, they wouldn't do that if AC was principal." I say, "Betty, AC would be arrested." If he didn't like things that were going on, he would have children, the men--I don't know how he punished girls. He didn't spank them or anything. He had them do manual labor. If there is a tree that has been cut down and the stump is still out there, he would have them dig up the stump. They couldn't do that today, but it was good for those boys. But Jerry was telling about the time and I said I couldn&#8217;t believe he--. I don't know what Jerry had done and it couldn't have been bad, but whatever he did, AC didn't like it. One of the times he had to move--something about the coal. And then he decided he couldn't--because we heated by coal--he couldn't move the coal for whatever reason, so he says, "Well, I want you to cut down this cedar tree that's growing by this window." So it happened to be the cedar tree that grew by Mrs. Sigmann's window. So Jerry goes to Mrs. Sigmann and says, "Mr. Little wants me to cut down that cedar tree." She said, "Oh no! You're not cutting down that cedar." That's when he had to move the coal. "You're not. You can't cut that tree. I'll go talk to Mr. Little. I'll go talk to the principal because that's my favorite tree." So Jerry then had to re-shovel and move the coal from wherever it had been dumped to another place. That's how Jerry was punished for that.         We had another man in our class who was in my class. Well, he wasn't in my class. But he ended up graduating with me because when he was in school, he had something he had been punished to do. He quit school because of the principal. He was telling this story at the same reunion when Jerry was talking about locking up the home economics teacher in the closet. But Jerry said--Cecil, not Cecil. Ken said that the reason he quit school was because of Mr. Little. And he was telling this right in front of these teachers who are still alive and they come to our reunion. He said that he was so mean that he quit school. He quit school, go married, had a couple of children, and he promised his mother when Mr. Little was no longer at the school he would go back. And he did. So he ended up, he was probably three years older than the class. So he went back to school as a married man with a couple of children and finished school. And he has a very successful business now. I guess I never got in his way, I don't know how he ever punished the girls. I do know that one of my classmates, it was his niece. She lived with one of her aunts. I was never sure whether her parents were dead, I just remember that she didn't. So she lived with her aunt. She was telling us that, because AC was her uncle, she said that one of her aunts that also worked in the cafeteria and she knew that Julia liked these big dill pickles. So she met her one day by the cafeteria and she had a pickle for her. So she put it in her mouth and started into the hallway eating on it and she saw her uncle coming down. She said, "I put that whole pickle in my mouth because I didn't want him to see me with it." I don't know what he would have done to her, but I thought that was so funny. So those are my high school years. We had an activity bus that would meet at the school if we were going to play a basketball game or softball game somewhere, we'd meet at the school to take the activity bus to wherever our games were.        EF: So sports were a big part of your--.        EPK: Oh yeah! We loved sports. Sports were a big part of most everybody's life. I don't know whether it was a big part of everybody's life, but for me, I love sports. I can remember sitting up watching that game when Carolina won that national championship in four overtimes. We didn't stay up late watching television and I keep thinking back, my dad let me stay up half the night for that game and watch it and he didn't send me to bed. But it was so funny because I can think back, we would have never stayed up watching television. Reading was a big thing. I loved reading too. I loved waiting for that book mobile to come through the community.        EF: Yeah.         EPK: From the library and they would stop at the houses. And you could pick out your books and they'd come along, I think monthly. I&#8217;m not sure how often it came. My dad subscribed to a lot of magazines to get the people out of the fields so that he could keep on working. They always walked to the tractor wherever you were working in the summertime. You knew it was a salesman and they were selling subscriptions. So we had Life, and Look, and Progressive Farmer, and Farmer Journal. We must have had half a dozen magazines coming to the house, but we enjoyed them too. I loved books. I remember the bookmobiles coming and looking forward to them coming. So yeah, sports were a big thing. I think in my area, you either liked North Carolina State or the University of North Carolina. I don't remember anyone ever talking about Duke or Clemson. I don't remember much about Clemson, either. This is when I was in library school, I was doing a class with one--we did it on the culture, the North Carolina culture. We wrote it, together, we wrote on North Carolina culture. And I remember a part of our culture was how you identified with a university team whether or not you had any aspirations or thought you'd ever go to that school. You identified with a team. I think that is pretty much still the way it is.         EF: That's fascinating.         EPK: The interesting thing is that when I went away to college, I went to a private school, because I was a female and the university here was not accepting females until 1972. I was telling a friend of mine when I was working about that, he had graduated from State. He said, "Oh Evelyn, you can't be right." I said, "Yes, yes!" Well, I had to prove it to him. Most folks don't know that.         EF: You're absolutely right.        EPK: I'm actually glad I went to Lenoir-Rhyne. It was small. It's still small. Excellent. My professors knew me, I knew them. So it was good. I actually thought about transferring but decided not to.        EF: Well, I want to ask you about college, but before I do I have one question before that and that's, again, with your childhood and growing up. Can you tell me about religious life in your family?        EPK: Well, we always went to church. We were Lutheran. We went to the Lutheran church, which was a little, little tiny church without a full time pastor, twice a month in the afternoons. We shared a pastor with a church in Stanley. He came up and did service. But we went to the Baptist church, which adjoined our farm. Well, actually, they built steps on my dad's farm and he finally deeded the land to them. So we went to the Baptist church all the time for every service. You know, Sunday. I don't know if we went to all the weekday meetings, but we went to bible school there and whatever they were having for worship services, we went to the Baptist church, but we were basically Lutherans. I don't think my family does much going to the Baptist church except for special occasions when they know someone is going to, somebody in the family, or they know somebody doing the Christmas play or something special like that. But, they go there to funerals and stuff. I can&#8217;t remember. The last time I went to that Baptist church was a friend's father's funeral. So I haven't been there in ages. But it adjoins our farm.        EF: So it was convenient?         EPK: Well, that was where the Baptist church community mostly went in that neighborhood.        EF: Sure. So how was it that your family was Lutheran?        EPK: I'm not sure. My dad may have grown up Baptist, but my mother's Lutheran. So they were very supportive, the churches, in terms of making contributions. The Amity Baptist church built a new church and they made contributions, and they built steps on the farm so daddy finally deeded them the land. So anytime there was a need in the family, that was something I learned from my parents, which I should have said. They exhibited, not necessarily told us, we learned it from them because that's the way they lived. You didn't take from the community, you gave to the community. So they were big givers into the community. So when the Lutheran church was built, the new church was built where they worship now. It was basically a lot of the labor came out of the church. There was a contractor who did a lot of the labor, but there was still a lot of labor. This church is historically very old. They've been here 220 or more years. That's a Lutheran belt through that community, through that part of North Carolina and some of the old settlers, they have histories of some of those old settlers and who preached in that church. So it's an old, old church. So there's an old cemetery. One of the things that my dad, mainly my dad and my brothers and this other man who was a member of the church--I don't know who's idea this was, probably my dad's, but he bought these old iron beams, pieces. I guess they were beams. He brought them home and he's going to make a cross out of these iron beams to put in the cemetery. The pastor at that time was relatively new and he didn't know a thing about farms either. He just retired a year ago, but he became good friends of the family and was very supportive of the family, but when he came there--. I'm trying to remember where he actually grew up in the west, Midwest, but he didn't know anything about farms. So he's coming to see these beams at my dad's farm and my mom's house, and he was driving down through the middle of the farm and he saw the way the fields were terraced, and he thought that was really weird. He didn't tell that for a long time. Somebody didn't know what they were doing. He didn't know what the purpose of that so he was telling that maybe after my dad died. So he came to see these beams. They built this beautiful cross. The former church pastor had given--he was a refugee from Latvia into the United States through Germany. He was in a camp in Germany. And they had a really sad story they would tell about how they got out of Latvia with the Russians, or Soviets, and they ended up in Germany in a camp there when the war came to an end. But he ended up in the United States. I don't know if he was first in Pennsylvania, but I think he was. He ended up with a PhD from Temple. But he was a Lutheran minister because Latvia is a Lutheran and Catholic country and you choose which education you want to go into, so he was Lutheran. He had been given somewhere along the way this beautiful brass bell from Southern Railroad. So this cross that my dad built and my brothers welded it together. It has a diamond in the metal.        EF: Oh okay.        EPK: And hangs the bell and the rest of the cross is this way and this way and then this way. They built it there on the farm and sprayed it and took it up to the church in the cemetery to put it into the ground. It has a concrete platform. I have some old pictures of them raising it up because to do that he had a tractor in the cemetery.        EF: Yeah, it's heavy.         EPK: To lift this up. You can see my brothers were so young and my dad's there. I think maybe one of my nephews was there, maybe. But it's neat to have that as a picture.        EF: Yeah. Is it still standing?         EPK: It still stands there and the bell rings for special occasions. When we do sunrise service, we do it in the cemetery and it is always around that. People all from the church up through the cemetery and up to that area and have sunrise service. So that was a big thing for our family to be involved in, helping to build a church. My mom was definitely all Lutheran with every tissue of her body, so she was always very supportive of the church. The other thing that they were very supportive of and helped with, we didn't have a fire department in our community. So they decided to have a volunteer fire department and had to raise money to build a facility. It was about five miles from our farm. I'd say five miles. And the way they did raise money and asking people to donate, they'd have dinners and different things, but one of the things that they did, and they haven't done these in a long time, but tractor pulls. Have you ever been to a tractor pull?        EF: Hmm.         EPK: No!        EF: Probably not.         EPK: My nephew still does tractor pulls for places, but what they do is--they would sell food. Part of raising the money was that they would sell food, but they would have this track built. They would be very specific with their track. My brother, one of my brothers was always the trackman. My mom would laugh. They mostly did this at night and they would charge relatively inexpensive to come in. But my mom would laugh. I was living in DC when a lot of this started and I would come home and I would go with her and they would say, "Oh Ms. Poole, you work so hard. You're with the Auxiliary club, you don't have to pay." She'd say, "I'll pay my way." She would pay for me, for her. And then she would joke with me that she provided the labor and the equipment. My brothers were over there working and she's got tractors over there. This is after my dad died I guess. So we provided the labor and the equipment because everybody participated like that. My mom was honored, after she died. My dad died two days after Christmas, three days after Christmas. My mom died up around Easter when Easter was in March.        EF: What year was that?        EPK: What year? My mom has been dead now--my dad died in the 1980s, my mom died in the late 1990s. Both were pretty sudden deaths. I shouldn't say pretty, they were not expected. That's when I knew how much people respected my dad because it was so cold. It was bitter, bitter cold, and at his wake people stood in line. It was wrapping around the block and you just knew that they had been contributors to their community and people appreciated their lives. That was very impressive to me. I think that's probably when I knew for certain and realized why I left Poole in my name. When my mom died, it was another thing like that. I would joke a long time after my mom died that she had all of her bases covered. She had every denomination at her wake and funeral. She had the sheriff&#8217;s department, she had the highway patrol, she had the Lincoln fire department, the Lincoln County fire department. People knew what she had done and how she had contributed to her community. I remember one highway patrolman who would patrol the area and he would sometimes stop and she would give him sweet tea because she--I'm not a not a tea drinker, but everybody loved my mom's sweet tea. So she was always giving him sweet tea and trying to convert his politics and his religion. She'd tell him, "Just join the Lutheran church. We'll ring that water out of you." He came through this receiving line. I remember of all the people, he came through and his comment was one that I remember, and it was "Your mom was the best woman [I] had ever known." But afterwards, the fire department was buying a new truck and its name is Babe after the lumber people. It's dedicated to my mom. So she has her own fire truck.        EF: That's really neat. As you were growing up, back to the religious question, what were your own beliefs about God and growing up?        EPK: I don't know if I ever really questioned. I accepted and joined the church. I mean, as a Lutheran, you join. I really liked participating. I liked all the activities. Well, we didn't have a lot of activities at our church that one Sunday afternoon. But at the Baptist church--. It may have been our entertainment or things that young people did, but we had--what would they call it now? Baptist youth? Young people. We'd have activities together. I don't remember ever really ever questioning. I just believed in God. I remember being with some people, and I think it was more of a political event, and they were much older than me, these women, but this woman didn't want to read anything that may bother her. If it was controversial, she was going to read what she had. I was thinking, "If you have a strong faith and your faith is strong and this is what you believe, how is this other stuff going to shape? It ought to make you stronger.&#8221; So I liked learning all of this stuff. At Lenoir-Rhyne, we had to take, it was required, you took Old and New Testament. That was very interesting, some of the concepts from that. I still have my Old and New Testament textbooks that once in a while I go back and refer to something in there. But I don't think I have ever questioned God. I think that's probably how my parents survived deaths in the family. When my sister died, when their family members died, they had a strong faith and believed that life goes on. And I know they believed in the hereafter.         I've never been one to question why God allows something. I now read what people say about that and I read articles or books on that, but I don't think God allows--I think a lot of our stuff is not something God says, "Well, I'm going to let this happen to you." I believe that because I think that's the difference in humans having the freedom to make decisions and animals that don't really think the same process. So I've never really thought that God lets bad things happen to good people. I bought and read that book and there have been other ones since then. I never subscribed to that. I think it might be because I just don't question God. I guess I had my own experience with that kind of thing. So my sister Martha had a very bad experience with childbirth and the birth of a child a little early. She actually survived. They had to stop breathing. A month later, I had a bad experience and I was back in DC where I almost died from a tube pregnancy, which is called an ectopic pregnancy. I barely made it to Georgetown where I passed out. I can remember in that emergency room, I didn't tell my husband about this for a long time because he was reading a lot about life after death, and he was very interested in Elisabeth Kubler Ross who wrote a lot about death and the stages of grief. I'm not sure how he got interested in that. But I didn't tell him for a long time. I can remember in that operating room a lot of things, I mean emergency room, but I can remember thinking and was probably being pushed into that emergency room, I can remember I can see a light at the end of the tunnel, so therefore I am not dead. When people talk about seeing lights, I remember that. I didn't tell my ex about that for a long time. I guess he believed me, but we didn't really discuss it. We never really discussed that much. So I never blamed God for that. I thank God that I lived. I was very close to death when that happened. I was very thankful that I lived. I know I have always been a person who has looked at my half-full rather than half-empty. So people talk about coincidence. Some things are just coincidence or sometimes God is involved in those. I'm thinking, "I could have died in that apartment building, but I made it to Georgetown hospital." I was at the right place at the right time. I went early because I had an appointment that afternoon, just a regular doctor appointment and my doctor was associated with Georgetown. So I'm thinking, &#8220;Things happen and maybe God was involved in some of that stuff.&#8221; I certainly didn't blame him for what happened, but I was very thankful. I am always glad I am alive.         EF: Wow, that must have been a big moment in your life.        EPK: It was pretty big.         EF: Yeah. When did that happen?        EPK: That was when I lived in DC. It was in 1977.         EF: Okay. And I'm going to rewind after this and get to how you ended up there, but how did your life change after that near death experience? Or did it?        EPK: It changed in some sense, I was between jobs and actually my husband was a student. He had gone back to school. He wanted to be a physician's assistant and so he had been working on Capitol Hill. So he went back to school and he was at Howard University. I was between jobs and because I had gotten so sick [at] the apartment, I went down to the apartment manager's house and I think she thought I was dying. She lived in the basement. She actually called the taxi and went with me to Georgetown. The janitor saw me leave and I guess it must have scared him to death. I must have looked so bad. I'm not sure how they ever got in touch with Charlie, my husband, but he ended up at Georgetown. But I was actually in the emergency room and I was in the operating room before I was ever admitted to this hospital. So I was in that room, the OR, and in recovery probably for at least five hours. But I was not admitted to the hospital, so you get taken care of. They're not going to let you lie in this room and die. So my husband got to the hospital and got me admitted and was so furious with the doctors for this point happening, I had to remind him that I am alive. But after that, I was not able to work probably for about a year, and I probably had an opportunity that I was unable to take to work for Voice of America, which I really wanted that job, but I knew I couldn't work. They actually interviewed me in the hospital over the phone and I just knew that I wouldn't be able to accept the job. So it took me a long time to get my strength back and find a job, so in that sense it changed my everyday activities, what I was doing. But it made me--it sort of sounds trite, but I don't mean it that way--it made me more appreciative of what I had and things I could do. In that sense, I think it made me more appreciative of life. I always regretted not having children but that's why I spoil nieces and nephews and then send them home. And friend's children. I've done a lot of spoiling of children.         EF: That's good.         EPK: I have some special boys in the neighborhood that I really spoil and other people's children that I have gotten to know through the years since I've gotten back here. I always joke that with somebody else&#8217;s, you can spoil them and then send them home.        EF: Right? Well, maybe we can rewind and you can explain your time at Lenoir-Rhyne and your early career.         EPK: Well, when I went to Lenoir-Rhyne, I told you I graduated in three years, and then I had some job interviews on campus to teach school and one of them--.        EF: You were an education major?        EPK: Right. Education major. First grade. I could have taught first, second, or third. I ended up teaching first grade. I had a job interview for Florida and Sanford, North Carolina and Maryland. I don't remember what the pay for Florida was, but I didn't think I wanted to go to Florida. But North Carolina was maybe $3000. It was the bottom of the barrel. So anyway, I went to Maryland and taught school two years at Prince George's County.         EF: Okay.        EPK: At Bladensburg Elementary school. Salary was fifty-two [hundred] the first year and the second year I think it was fifty-six [hundred]. My goal was to teach school for two years and then go to graduate school. I was going to get to the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill one way or another, I guess. So my goal was to do that and so that's what I did. I've always--I live frugally. I had an apartment and the second year I had an apartment and a person that lived with me. She wanted to share the apartment with me. But the first year I was by myself and so I lived very frugally. I had a lot of friends. I met a lot of friends in the apartment building and other places. But we didn't do a lot. We went to the beach a lot. I went to ski a lot on the weekends, snow ski with friends. But mostly we went to the eastern shore in the summertime. I'd come back home and I'd get a summer job and I'd go back to DC. One summer I came home and then I had saved enough money to--I had all of $2000 saved up to come to Carolina for graduate school. I got accepted. I don't know why, but I guess I knew I would be.        EF: For which program?        EPK: I was getting a masters in education and I was concentrating, also, in political science.         EF: Okay.        EPK: But when I was in my program, I was doing a lot of political science, classes on governments, and they mostly were in the daytime. Education was teaching a lot of classes I needed at night. I changed my mind about wanting to go back to teaching school. It had a lot to do with principals who were coming back for their certificate. And in these evening classes--there's water running off.        EF: No problem.        EPK: These evening classes, these principals were always so negative about their teachers and I would ask them, "Well if your teachers have your problems, what are you doing to help them?" I never really got good answers to that. I thought, &#8220;Well, I wonder if all the principals are like this. They're coming back for certifications or whatever it is they're coming back for, but they're negative about their teachers but they're not supporting their teachers.&#8221; And I was falling in love with my political science classes. One of my professors there was more like my advisor than whatever, and so I decided I didn't want to go back to teaching school. I wanted a job. I loved federal government, so I wanted to work on Capitol Hill. So that's what I did. I went back to Maryland. I still had my apartment. A friend had been subletting it. So I got a job on Capitol Hill with a member of congress from North Carolina, Earl Ruth, who was a new member. He had been president of Catawba College. I worked for him for about a year and my congressman was Mr. Charles Raper Jonas from my Lincoln County. He knew I was there and he had known me. I had worked on his campaigns when I was not even able to drive. They'd take me to the office to work. Whatever they were doing. Handing out postcards to people. He knew I was in DC and wanting to work with him, so one day he spoke--one day I was at work and in the office and Congressman Ruth came in and said, "Could I come in his office and talk to him?" He said, "Well, Charlie talked to me on the floor today and he said he would like for you to come to work for him, but he doesn't want to ask you unless it's okay with me. But do you want to go work for Charlie?" I went to work for Mr. Jonas and worked for him until he retired. What I would do for him, I was a caseworker. Worked on constituent problems. I also did that for Congressman Ruth, but when the house was in recess or adjournment, I would come to the district with him. So I loved working with him like that. I could either work in DC or if we were in adjournment or recess, I'd go to work and he would say, "I know you're going home today, so why don't you don't go down and don't get there late." He'd let me drive home in the daylight and then he would call up my mom and dad and say, "Evelyn is coming home today." But he never called me Evelyn. He always called the women in his office miss or missus. The first time I heard him call me Evelyn, we were in recess and we were in the Jonas law firm in Lincolnton working, and Jim Martin was running for his seat, Governor Jim Martin. I heard that he was in the office and I knew that he was there. I was back with all these displaced lawyers wanting to have an office and I heard Mr. Jonas say--and I always called him mister. I didn't call him congressman. I heard him say, "Well, if you can get the Pooles in Pumpkin Center to vote for you, Jim, you're going to win. Well isn't that right, Evelyn?" Well I had never heard him call me Evelyn. He called me Evelyn. I about fell out of the chair. I didn't answer and he said, "Well, isn't that right, Evelyn?" I said, "Yes, yes it is." So he brought it back. I had already met Jim Martin so he brought him back there and we talked. But that was the only time he called me Evelyn. He might call my parents and say, "I'm sending Evelyn home today and she's coming home," or something. But in the office he always called the women--. Now he called the men by their first names, but he called the women miss or missus.         After I worked for Jim Martin, then. After he was hired, I worked for him. I can't remember if I worked for him more than a year, but then I decided I wanted to work on the Senate side and learn about the Senate side, because it is so different. So I went to work for Ed Brooke from Massachusetts. That was an experience. I worked for him about three years. Actually, he was running for office, rerunning. His senate seat was up so he had to run for office again. Somebody told me he did this, but I didn't know it. I had a hard time understanding what he did. He reorganized his office and the women on his staff that were married and of childbearing age, he sort of dismissed us. There was [one] in Boston and there was one in DC and I was the one in DC. And that was when I was unemployed when I was pregnant. That period of time when I said I had to find a job but I couldn't because of my health. But I never could quite understand that. So I worked for him three years, I think it was. I work for his press. I mean, I was good. I did well. I never had an issue with him. He always complemented me on what I was doing and how I did it. So I never could quite understand how he dismissed two women. In today's world--you didn&#8217;t have those rights. The inequalities on Capitol Hill, basically even now. You work at the mercy of the member of congress, and if they lose you're out of a job. If they want to rearrange--reorganize, not arrange--reorganize their office. But he was always a very, he was a perfect gentleman with me. I never had an issue with him except getting fired, but basically I insisted on getting unemployment. I did get that. Because you have to be fired to get unemployment. Not fired, but let go or whatever. Anyway, I got that. So I was unemployed for, I mean, I wasn't working for more than a year, maybe a year and a half or so. I went to work for a congressman from Kentucky and he was my last member that I worked for.         EF: What was his name?        EPK: John Breckinridge from Kentucky. And I was press secretary for him.        EF: So your political career spanned several members of both congress and one senator.         EPK: Right.        EF: And stretched for a long period of time as well.        EPK: Right.        EF: When did you begin?        EPK: I went to DC--I finished down here in 1969. I went up late 1969 to 1979. So it was about ten years.        EF: Right. And you mentioned one thing I wanted you to elaborate on, that when you were in high school, I guess you worked on a campaign. So if you could talk about your early politics? How did you get interested?        EPK: Well, I think it was because--. It was Mr. Jonas's campaign. We had to know what was going on in the world and parents, we watched the news when we had a TV or you listened to the news and you read the newspaper, and we were political in the sense that we were expected to participate. Of course you had to vote and you had to. My parents were strong Republicans. So they knew people who had been in office or were in office and so that's where I became involved. So Mr. Jonas's campaign--they used to do these wonderful rallies in Lincoln County to wrap up a campaign, but before then, his campaign office, I'm not even sure, I remember going to an office building. I couldn't drive so I had to be taken, but addressing envelopes, I mean cards, mailing them to all their voters. So I would address all these cards. That's how I got involved with Mr. Jonas. Then when I was at Lenoir-Rhyne, in my history class--I think it was a history class, government--the professor, him and his wife both were there--and he was a very, very strong Democrat. We had to get permission to be out of the dorm to go to the student union and stay up to listen to the presidential returns.         EF: Which election was this?        EPK: This was, well I graduated in 1966, so this was Johnson--.        EF: Goldwater.        EPK: Goldwater and Johnson.         EF: In 1964. Okay.         EPK: Yeah. But this professor was also from Georgia and my state was Georgia that I had to watch, and Georgia went Republican and it about killed this professor. So that we had to do as students, but in high school I was in student government. We didn't have Republican or Democrat parties or those clubs, but we were involved in student government in some way. In college I don't remember us having clubs, but we had student government. But this class I remember being up all night for this election and how we had to be signed out of our dorms. You know, permission to stay out all night.         EF: During this period, were you also identifying as a Republican?        EPK: I was already a registered Republican.        EF: Okay.        EPK: I was a registered Republican already. I never thought so much about being a conservative back then. When I was working for Jim Martin, I was a legislative assistant, and thinking about legislation, I probably would have been more of--. I remember the War Powers Act was one of the things that passed when Jim Martin was there. I was probably more moderate than I am today, maybe. I am probably more, I know I'm more conservative. But I've always been fiscally conservative. All my life. I lived that way. I expect the government to be almost as fiscally conservative. I wish it were. We wouldn't have this debt of eighteen trillion dollars. So I think I've changed in some sense. I don't remember so much being conservative or not conservative when I worked for Ruth or Mr. Jonas, but I remember Mr. Jonas talking about the fiscal debt and campaigns. But I probably was more aware of being conservative or moderate, but I don't think terms were so much used back then.        EF: It was more about party affiliation?        EPK: I think it was more about party affiliation.         EF: You said your parents were Republicans?        EPK: Mhmm. My parents were Republicans. Republicans and Lutherans.        EF: Right. That's interesting. I wanted to get a sense of that. You worked on Capitol Hill at multiple offices through the 1970s.         EPK: So I would say that when I worked for Senator Brooke, he was more--some people now--he just died, by the way, a couple of weeks ago. People were talking about him and he was being written up as being liberal, but I don't remember ever thinking that. I thought he was moderate, if I had to term him. I don't remember thinking that he was really liberal. I do remember that he was really pushing for President Nixon to resign, and when he resigned I was probably on his side running the office. I guess, again, I don't think those were necessarily terms that were so much used then, and they're being associated with him now by policy or things he supported or was interested in. I think in that sense, I wouldn't call him a liberal, but truly a moderate.         EF: What was it like to work on Capitol Hill as a Southern woman? You did mention about, I think it was Congressman Jonas who would call the women miss or missus and call all the men by their first names, but what was it like in general to be a woman in that environment?         EPK: Well, you knew that you weren't being paid equal salaries. Even in my last job, I was not paid equal, when I was on there with Breckinridge. But I was always treated with respect, but I can tell you it was different working with Senator Brooke from Massachusetts and I'll tell you a funny story there. When I was hired, I was working in his press office and one of the legislative assistants--I maybe shouldn't tell you who he is.        EF: It&#8217;s okay. You can leave names out.
EPK: I'm going to leave his name out--he said to me one day and I just cracked up laughing because he was not the press assistant, I mean press secretary. I was more a press assistant, but the press secretary never said this to me. Always, people wouldn't know the difference between Steve and me, our titles. This legislative assistant said to me one day, something about that they would let me--I hadn't been hired maybe a week or so--they'd let me have all the--. And I knew that I was going to be talking to a lot of the press in New York and Massachusetts, Rhode Island, whoever called, but they said, &#8220;They will think, they're going to give you all the black stations.&#8221; Can you imagine saying that today? &#8220;They're going to give you all the black stations and they will think you are a black, Southern woman.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have to be kidding. I do not sound like. They will know as soon as I talk to them that I am not a black, Southern woman.&#8221; And they couldn't understand this. So one day this same legislative assistant--Senator Brooke didn't throw in a lot of black lingo or this jiving talking stuff, but he went to the barber shop with him one day, and he came back the next day and said, "Evelyn, I saw a whole different world in that barber shop." I'm sure a lot of the people and not everyone I called was a black station. To give them a press release or some information or asking them to do something, but one day one of the New York stations called, and I knew he was black and I had talked to him a lot and he said--I'm not sure these things even, I just laugh, but I'm not sure if they would be said today, but this was the late 1970s. [He] said, "I think I'm going to be down in DC soon and I thought I'd come by and visit you because I've fallen in love with your voice. But you know I'm black, don't you?" So he knew I was white. He wouldn't have said that otherwise. I said, "Yes, I know you're black, but that's fine. I'd love to meet you." But if he came, he didn't come to the office when I was there, at least. It had been hard for me--I think it would have been very hard for me to talk to black station people, TV people, radio people, and for them to think that I was a black Southern woman. But that's what this person said. I mean, I thought that was the funniest thing in the world. I think sometimes--and then it had a lot to do a lot with not necessarily Capitol Hill. I remember, this was in Ed Brooke's office, I remember a receptionist calling and telling me that they had Colonel somebody from the air force or something who wanted to give me a press release. At the time -- and this still works this way, I'm sure -- whichever party is in power in the White House administration, if there has been something given to a state as a grant or money something, if they're going to get recognition, it goes to the party in power. Nixon was in power, so Ed Brooke got some information before Ted Kennedy. So, I said okay. I answered the phone and this man said to me, he had this grant he wanted to give me. So and so says, "Sweetie, do you have a pencil?" I said, "Yes I do, dear." He always called me by my name after that. Never called me sweetie. It may have been the first time that I talked to him, but I talked to him a lot of times after that, but he always called me by my name.        EF: Yeah.        EPK: So there was that very subtle stuff. I just said, "Yes I do, dear," and that was the end of that. After that he always called me, he asked to speak to me by my name. He asked the receptionist to speak to me by my name. So I think there was that kind of a thing--I don't think that had to be necessarily had to be a Southern woman, I think that was probably woman in general could be.        EF: Sure.        EPK: I can't recall ever having those types of, from members of Congress or anything. Like with Ed Brooke. I remember going with him to do an interview over on Wisconsin Avenue at one of the TV stations. It was a noon program. I can't remember the name of it. On the way, he's driving. He has this little Mercedes, a little sports car. We&#8217;re on Wisconsin Avenue and he sees this chain of restaurants. You could get two dozen chicken wings for five dollars. He goes, "Oh, do you think we have time to stop?" He loved chicken wings. "You think we have time to stop for chicken wings, Evelyn?" I said, "No. At twelve o'clock we have to be there at twelve. This is not recorded, this is live." So we didn't, but on the way back we stopped for chicken wings. He asked, "Do you like chicken wings?" I said, "Yeah." So we stopped and he even bought my chicken wings. But then we go past this florist and he decided he wanted to stop at this florist. So he stops and he sees something he wanted to buy. He said, "Oh, I only have a one hundred dollar bill. Do you have any money, Evelyn?" I said, "No. You have a hundred-dollar bill, they can exchange it. No, I don't think I have any cash today and I won't ever get paid back." So he paid with his hundred-dollar bill and he got change and that was so funny, you only have a hundred dollar bill, they can change your money. So we get back to the office and he comes in carrying his plant and some of these legislative assistants--. He had one woman at that time was a legislative assistant, she was from Georgia, but she had gone to Radcliff or somewhere, no one would have known that she was from Georgia. They all asked me, "Did you drive for him Evelyn?" I said, "No! He can drive." "Well did you carry the plant?" "No. I didn't buy the plant, I didn't carry the plant." It was like they worshipped this man. It was so funny because I respected him, and he treated me with upmost respect, but I never thought I would need to drive him or carry his plant. But another funny thing from his--he had some interesting people work for him. The gas war was going on. Well, you wouldn't remember that.        EF: I've read about it. In the late 1970s.         EPK: It's history, you would know about it. The gas war was going on. You could only buy gas with your even and odd days. Well it was his day so he could buy gas. So he sent this young man that who was going to Maryland to school who would get the incoming mail and separate it out, who gets what and whatever and other things he did. He said, "Well, Jim, take my car and get some gas." You were only allowed so much. I can't remember. It wasn't much. He came back and he asked, "Did you fill it up, Jim?" He said no, he bought whatever was allowed. He said, "Well, did you tell them whose car it was?" He said, "No. I was afraid to tell them whose car it was because you know." Give me a little privilege here. He had a license plate that was very identifiable. But this was kind of the little things you look back upon and think it's funny. But John Breckinridge, he was the only Democrat I worked for, but he was very conservative. But again, he treated me--I might take a press release over to the House side in the Capitol for him to approve or disapprove or whatever. He'd say, "I'm walking back to the office. Walk back with me." So instead of walking down stairs, we walked down those Capitol steps and he would hold my arm like a Southern gentleman. But he was defeated in his race for re-election. Then I think he died within the next year. I think he died from a stroke. But he was very conservative and I never had any problems working for him.         EF: So after your legislative career, after working for Congressman Breckinridge, right?        EPK: Mhmm. I was unemployed.        EF: Right. So then, I mean, maybe you can tell me about your career and life after that and eventually coming to Chapel Hill and becoming a librarian for different outlets.
EPK: Okay. Like I said, I was unemployed because your job depends on the member. I got laid off, laid off or fired from Senator Brooke. He was defeated also. So I would have still been without a job, he was defeated for a lot of reasons. I was unemployed and my husband was finishing up, he was finishing his work at Howard and so he was going to be looking for a job, and I was going to be looking for a job. And I don't even know if he looked, he just wanted to move to North Carolina. He was from Rochester, New York and didn't want to live in New York. Neither did I. I said, "Well, this area would be good. I would consider this area." I thought I would not have a big problem getting a job, but I did. I was unemployed for more than a year.         EF: You mean around Chapel Hill?        EPK: Yeah. We lived in Durham for a year and then we moved to Hillsborough. It was the height of the recession and I was offered one job at Blue Cross Blue Shield and I disliked Blue Cross Blue Shield, but it was a job I was looking for. But they didn't want to pay. They wanted to pay me the same as a starting person fresh out of college. I said, "No way you can you. I have already proven that I can do this work." And so I tried to negotiate and I guess I went out of bounds with them because they said, "Did you call so and so trying to negotiate your salary?" I said, "Yes I did." Well, that was not the right thing to do. But they were still interested in me. There were some other issues that were going to make me unhappy if I took this job. But it was the job I was really looking for. I waited until the last minute. They gave me five days to make up my mind. I waited until the last day, the last five minutes to tell them that I wasn't taking the job. And then I found this job at EPA as a temporary. I worked in this temporary job for about two years. It was more like a year. And then I reported the agency for having asbestos in their building and we got evacuated out of the building and shut down out of that building that we were in. It wasn't the only [inaudible] we were in. So then they suddenly couldn't rehire me into this temporary position. Like I fell off the turnip truck yesterday. I knew exactly why they didn't rehire me. It was because I turned EPA in to enforcement to Atlanta to have the building checked out. I couldn't figure out why I had this white stuff on my desk. So then I was still unemployed for about a year and I got a job with NOAA. So it became a permanent job. So with NOAA--.        EF: That's the National Oceanic Atmospheric A--.        EPK: Administration. It's under the department of commerce. We were working merrily along until one--. Bill Clinton and Al Gore were president and vice president and they were going to reorganize the government and decrease the size of the government. Can you believe this? Decrease the size. So we went home for Christmas, we were at holiday for Christmas. Most people were out. The offices are so sparsely populated at holidays. So I was home. I was over at my parents, and we went back to work, and we learned that we were getting pink slips because here we were an agency from NOAA working for the EPA, and NOAA needed to get its numbers down. So to get its numbers down they were going to lop off these sixty people that were with this group in Research Triangle Park. The way we got reinstated was the laboratory director for EPA that we worked for, through an interagency agreement, it was all on air quality modeling and atmospheric research, but the group I was with developed all of EPA's air quality models. I'm not just talking about here, but all of the EPA. In the model they use for air quality came out of this group I worked with. They didn't have people who could do that. And it wasn't in their authorized legislation to have these people. So the laboratory director went to bat for us and got us reinstated.         So it was then that I decided I would try and go to library school. I just knew I would be accepted. I would go to library school because if I happened to find another job as a librarian--. I was considered a technical editor, but we had a very small, specialized library for this group of people I worked for, and I did all the library work, but I was titled a technical editor because I did write for the group and edited journal articles. I had to take an SAT again. God, what a nightmare. I took it, at that time it was a new thing that you could take it on the computer, and I did, which was a disaster. I didn't score very well. I scored higher on math than I did on English or whatever. It was literature or whatever, which was a flip for me. I had taken one class over at night school with Evelyn Daniels, who was a professor, and it was more like I was auditing. She let me audit if I would present a paper, which I did. So I ran into her and she asked, "Well, how did you do on that?" I said, "Evelyn, I did terrible." So she said, "Write me a letter and tell me about your experience doing it on the computer," because she was really interested in having the SAT on the computer. So I did and I had applied and I had a couple of people from work, scientists, who wrote recommendations for me. I think that I hadn't started class, it was for the fall, but it was almost cut off time for accepting applications and this one scientist would call me and say, "Evelyn, have you heard anything yet?" I'd say, "No Bill, I haven't." "Well I know that you're going to be accepted because of my letter." I never knew what he wrote. I would love one day to see what he wrote. So finally I was on the waitlist. And then Bill would call. "Have you heard anything?&#8221; "No." So finally I got accepted. That's how I decided to go back to school.         EF: That's for the school of library and information sciences at UNC?        EPK: Right. And that's--.        EF: And this is the mid-1990s?        EPK: Yeah. I finished in 1997.         EF: Okay.
EPK: I was separated and divorced and otherwise I'm not sure my husband could have lived with me doing that. Because I basically worked and did school and ate a little bit and slept a little bit and worked. I was so focused. It was the only way you can go to school and work fulltime. I basically was working fulltime and going to school fulltime. Because this was a two-year program. Someone told me I was crazy, and I said, "Well I may be." I really did enjoy school that time. I did enjoy it before, but I think I probably enjoyed those two years in school more than the other times I was in school and I don't know why. I was involved in student government. I was representing the library school, so that was fun. My boss was very understanding in letting me work whenever. I did the same amount of work. I think all of the scientists knew I was in school, but if they needed something they sent me emails and they let me--and we had rudimentary emails back then--or they left me notes. I don't think they suffered. They got whatever they wanted when they wanted it. My boss was very understanding. So I may work from, go in early in the morning and work until ten o&#8217;clock because I had eleven o&#8217;clock class. I should have gotten speeding tickets, but I never did. I was always zooming from Research Triangle Park to here and back and maybe work another couple of hours and then have a night class. It was a pretty intense two years of my life. I didn't have a lot of entertainment then or go a lot of places. I visited my family back home, and my family knew that I was in school and they were very supportive. In fact, I dedicated my thesis to my mom, and my sister, Betty, proofread it, so it is dedicated to them. They were very interested in my thesis. It was a very intense time, but the only time I really thought I flipped and thought I should be put in the looney bin was the night my thesis--. I had borrowed this old computer from work they had discarded, but they let me bring it home, because I didn't have a computer at home. About three o&#8217;clock in the morning when I'm finishing up this thesis and I'm thinking, "You have to be crazy, Evelyn. But you have come too far to stop. This thing is due at eleven o&#8217;clock." And you know, from being in school and doing this, if it's not there at eleven, eleven o one doesn't count. Anyway, it got turned in on time and my family came over to see me graduate. I had not gone through the graduation and I didn't buy a ring, so this time--when I did the other one--I thought I'm doing the whole nine yards. I'm going to the graduation ceremony and I'm having a nice little ring. So I did.         EF: That's neat.         EPK: It was a beautiful--our gradating day could not have been more perfect. It was about seventy-two degrees and blue sky and Erskine Bowles spoke. He went on and on and on. It was like, "Well my daddy told me this. And the seventh thing my daddy taught." But he talked and talked and talked. But it was a beautiful day and my mom and sister and niece came over. Some friends from Hillsborough came.        EF: That's neat.         EPK: That's how I became known as the librarian.         EF: Right. And so then, in what way did your career change after getting that degree?        EPK: Well, first, I asked my boss to categorize me as a librarian. He thought, "Why?" I said, "Because I have earned it and I want to be known as a librarian." And actually it was very interesting that he was so proud. He was letting everybody know that Evelyn had gotten her degree and it was so funny. There were a lot of people involved in that. So I probably earned a little bit more money, but not a lot. Not a lot more. In terms of my life changing, I can stop thinking like a graduate student. If I want to go out to a movie with friends or I can go out to dinner or thinking, "Oh yeah, I do have some extra money. I can buy a new coat. I don't have to whatever." The relaxation of it. Having time. I don&#8217;t think I have to write a paper, I don't have to read somebody's articles in some journal.        EF: Did you spend the rest of your career with NOAA?        EPK: I did. I did.         EF: And you retired from them recently?        EPK: I retired in 2006.         EF: Okay.        EPK: Or 2007. 2006 or 2007. Anyway, I still go out there because they do these little Christmas things that we used to do with the secretaries. They'll say, "Well we're going to do our little breakfast. Can you come? Tell me when you can come and that's when we'll plan it."         EF: That's nice.        EPK: They invite me to all of their little events. I just say an email. I didn't have time to read it before I left and it was one of the scientists who is retiring. Wanting me to know that Robin is retiring. It's in February, I know. So I'll go out for that. He and I, our offices used to be--. I have to look up some old pictures because we were moving from that building to a new EPA complex, and some of us were working around the clock to get ready to go and Robin's office was right beside of mine. We were always sharing snack food or whatever. So I'll have to share some of the stories with Robin when he retires.         EF: Outside of your career at NOAA and then since your retirement, how have you remained active in Republican politics in the area?         EPK: Well, see that's what the interesting thing is. I could not be active before. I have to have a drink of water.        EF: Sure.        EPK: My mouth is getting dry.         EF: Sure.        EPK: As a federal employee, you can't be active in politics.        EF: Sure. I see        EPK: I was never a troublemaker in the sense that I could always be depended on to be at work and do my job and go beyond the call of duty, but if I didn't like the way something looked, I didn't mind saying so. I reported this building for having asbestos in it. Well, it turned out it was asbestos. And some of the people at the EPA thought it was outrageous that I would do this. I told you, I didn't get rehired. I was working at another building--we were always in different buildings until they built this complex. The union people, whoever was heading up the union would come around during elections and they would put this information, a sheet of paper on your desk and it's who you should vote for, during work time. I began to think, "Well, I can't be involved in politics except I can give money." At the most I could give money. You couldn't stand on the street corner and hand out literature. You couldn't really go to meetings. So if I can't do that, why is this union person allowed to come around with sheets of paper, leaving it on my desk during work hours telling me who to vote for. So I reported it to the inspector general of EPA and it got put a stop to. They had to stop doing that so I felt really good about that. That was my political activity. I was only able to become politically active once I retired. That's when I joined the Republican Women&#8217;s' Club.        EF: Mhmm. In Orange County.        EPK: Well, it's Chapel Hill.         EF: Oh right, right.        EPK: It's called the Republican Women&#8217;s' Club of Chapel Hill.         EF: Right.        EPK: It's Orange and Durham and Chatham, the members are. And Wake. We did have some people in Wake. I'm not sure they're still members. They might be members in Wake now. But the title is Republican Women of Chapel Hill. Then I started going to Orange County meetings and becoming active in the elections that were coming up. I did a lot of that in 2012. I've worked in all of the elections since I retired, but I was very active in 2012. With headquarters. I didn't do much in the following year because I had breast cancer and that slowed me down a little bit, but this year, I'm okay. I'm fine.        EF: Right.         EPK: I don't do so much out at the polls as I did in 2012 and in 2010 I worked outside the polls. In 2012 I did some outside work. In 2008, some outside work and poll observing inside. But this year, I basically worked in the headquarters, which I really enjoy doing. Talking on the phone with people or people coming into the office. Giving them information about where they can vote, or when the polls opened and closed, and looking up their voter information for them since most of them don't know a lot about their voter information. So that's basically what I did this year. So that was a lot of fun.         EF: And how did your involvement and working for different congressmen and one senator, and then working for the federal government in a couple of roles over the year[s], how did your involvement in federal politics and then working a federal job influence your conservatism?        EPK: Well, that's interesting because when I went to work at the EPA, it was the most political place I ever worked. I mean, I worked on Capitol Hill and it's political. The EPA, I think all of their decisions are based on politics. It is amazing how much politics goes on there and it's more amazing how much is wasted. It blew me away. It blew me away. From the time I went to work there until I left, how much money, how much is wasted, how inefficient the place is and overstaffed and waste of staff time or staff wasting their own time and getting away with it. I was always amazed at things that they would let slide by. Staff being lazy. Staff goofing off. Lots of travel that's so insignificant, up and down the coastline. Or reassigning a person from Research Triangle Park to Cincinnati. So you reassign them, but you pay them to travel back and forth because their family is still here because their family doesn't want to move. Then they get paid for travel back and forth and then they get extra payment because they're now on a detail. Instead of assignment, they call it detail. So they get paid extra for housing wherever they are on detail. I mean, it's amazing the waste and then they talk about their budget. So I fly up to Washington one day to talk to someone about something. There's a telephone. It always blew my mind how much was wasted. There was waste--well somebody would tell me, "Well Evelyn, that was thirty years ago." But there was waste then on Capitol Hill, I'm sure, but in the offices I worked in, there was not that much waste. Now the members had a budget, a travel budget from where they could fly back home and depend on where they're located. Or drive back home or whatever. But there wasn't that much, I don't think waste, by staff. And people [worked] pretty hard. The staffers on Capitol Hill worked pretty hard. I know, that was in the 1970s. I think there were harder because they know that their job is at the mercy of the member being reelected. You know, a lot of things, the decisions, are made by politics. But it's all a political game. You don't expect that in the agencies or the departments. The EPA is still an agency. It's not a department. I was always blown away by how much politics played in the decisions made by the agency. And some of those inefficient administrators they had. Like Carol Brown. She was the worst.         EF: So I guess all of that influenced your political ideology?        EPK: I think that it probably--it reinforced my believing in smaller government.        EF: Which you said is really rooted in your childhood.         EPK: And being fiscally responsible. We were raised well. I can remember our dad saying, "You don't buy things on time if you can't afford it. The only things that you should buy on time are a house and maybe a car.&#8221; But you buy what you need, and we had a big family and things for us were needs and Christmas might be wants. But it was like running to Toys 'R Us and going to Walmart. So it was based on need with us. So we handed down clothes. I mean my sister would hand down to me and I would hand down to my sister. She finally moved past me. Or there was something. This is a Sunday outfit, these are school clothes and these are outdoor work cloths or play cloths. You didn't mix them up. So I still live that way. When I come home from Church, I'm not going to out in the garden and pull weeds. I don't wear Sunday--these are really dressy and are nice clothes. They're going to the church. They're not going to the grocery store. So I'm sure that's totally rooted in my childhood and being fiscally responsible. I don't even have to think too much about that.         I think maybe I became more conservative in a lot of my making decisions in looking at issues and how I would make decisions about them. I think that the fact that I worked on Capitol Hill, I do have an understanding of the legislative process, which hasn't really changed. I mean, thirty-years ago. The legislative process is the same as it has been for the last thirty years. So I can understand more about political decisions. And how members might arrive at a decision about an issue or a piece of legislation that is pretty good, but it has a couple of bad places. Places or things that may need to be rewritten. I don't think a lot of people don't know the legislative process. A lot of people I know don't know the legislative process, so they don't understand that part. But I think that working at EPA made me more conservative.         EF: Well thanks for that explanation. Those are all of the questions I have, which brings us to today. Before I turn the recorder off, I know it has been two plus hours, so I appreciate your time.        EPK: I won't charge you for the extra.         EF: Before I turn off the recorder, is there anything else you would like to add or say?        EPK: This has been fun, actually.        EF: Well good.        EPK: This is better than my NPR interview.        EF: Great! I'm glad to hear it. Well, I'll go ahead and turn these off. Thank you again.
