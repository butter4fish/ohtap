Speaker 1: --My name is Julieanna Richardson.  I'm the interviewer and Neculai Burghelea is the videographer.  And I'd like you to start out by stating your name and spelling it for us, and your date of birth.  And I want to say that this interview is to supplement the '[An] Evening With Richard Parsons' that was held in Washington, D.C. on Saturday, November 15, 2008.
Speaker 2: My name is [HistoryMaker] Richard Parsons--
Speaker 1: Middle name.
Speaker 2: Richard Dean Parsons, P-A-R-S-O-N-S.  My date of birth is April 4, 1948.
Speaker 1: And today's date?
Speaker 2: Today's date is December 22, I believe, 2008.
Speaker 1: And our location?
Speaker 2: We're at the Time Warner Center in New York City [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 228622
Speaker 1: I want to go back and ask you--I would like to explore both of your family trees, first starting with your mother [Isabelle Judd Parsons].  Can you tell me what you know about her, her side of the family?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my mother was born in Tarrytown, New York, or what is now North Tarrytown, Pocantico Hills [New York].  Her father was a man named William [ph.] Judd and he was from North Carolina, Sanford, North Carolina.  And her mother, I don't know her mother's maiden name.  Her mother's name was Anna [ph.], so Anna Judd was my grandmother.  And she was mostly American Indian [Native American] from some reservation in--over in Nyack [New York] on the other side of the Hudson River from Tarrytown.
Speaker 1: Did your mother talk at all about her growing up?  You don't remember--
Speaker 2: Did my mother talk about her own growing up?
Speaker 1: Her own growing up.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Can you tell, tell us some stories?
Speaker 2: A few.  She, she remembers, as I said she was born in North Tarrytown, and she remembers as a kid her father worked on the Rockefeller family estate [Kykuit, Sleepy Hollow, New York], that's the Rockefeller family area.  And she, so she does remember, at least she told me on occasions, you know going up to the estate, getting a dime from John D. Rockefeller, the original, who used to go and hand out dimes to the kids.  And you know so growing up in that area, which was pretty rural at the time.  But they--my mother and my, my grandmother and my grandfather I guess split up when my mother, who was the youngest of six, was five years old.  And so she moved to Brooklyn [New York, New York], which is where her mother moved and her older sisters and brothers lived.  And would just come up to the country on occasion to you know like weekends or once a month or something to see her father.  So she didn't have a lot of recollections of, of, of the place she was born.  She went to a, for a while she went to a girls boarding school in New Jersey.  I can't remember the name of it.  She--I think got into Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] when she graduated from high school and went for a year.  But didn't, didn't finish, didn't--just finished the one year.  And she was--her mother died when she was sixteen and had been pretty sick before then, arthritis.  And so her--she often thought of her older sister, she sister named Iona [ph.] who was nine years older than her, who really was sort of responsible for the last half of raising her.  Because her mom, her mom was a cook, and her father was a groundskeeper as I said on the Rockefeller estate.
Story_ID: 228623
Speaker 1: Did she [Parson's mother, Isabelle Judd Parsons] say growing up was hard then for her?  In some respects, or she doesn't talk--she didn't talk about it in that way (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, she--I mean my--that wasn't my mother.  I think growing up was not easy.  But, but my mother was, my mother's not a victim personality type.  So no, she didn't have lots of stories about how, how tough it was.  It just was, she didn't characterize it one way or another.
Speaker 1: Now did--what, what do you think of your mother do you have in you?
Speaker 2: Half her genes, and which ones are they?  When I was younger--it's interesting, people who've known me many, many years say the older I get, the more I look like my father [Lorenzo Parsons] cause I used to favor my mother, my mother's side of the family very much when I was younger.  In terms of aspects of character, as I said, she is--my mother is not one that ever thinks of herself as a victim or as powerless.  And I think that's an aspect of character that I've inherited from her.  She loved a good time, my mother did.  She loved to dance, she loved parties.  I think I inherited that.  Grit--I would come back to sort of the grit part.
Speaker 1: She had a lot of grit.
Speaker 2: Yeah she did.
Speaker 1: Stamina.
Speaker 2: Grit.
Speaker 1: Oh you said grit--
Speaker 2: Grit.
Speaker 1: That's right--
Story_ID: 228624
Speaker 1: Now your father, can you give his name and what you know about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father is Lorenzo Locklair Parsons, and he was the oldest of eight.  Born in Newport News, Virginia in 1916.  He was the oldest of eight.  His father worked in the, who's name was Eastwick [ph.].  Now how's that for a name?  Eastwick Parsons.  He worked in the shipyards in Newport News where all the big battleships that were turned out during the war [World War II, WWII].  His, his mother, I don't think his mother ever really worked out of the house.  Her name was Harriet [ph.], Harriet Parsons.  Don't know her maiden name.  And she was a full time homemaker in that sense, there was nine, eight kids.  Probably is a full time job, right?  My father's father, Eastwick, was the thirteenth of thirteen children.  He's from Williamsburg, Virginia.  And his father was a freed slave.  And had been given property down on the river, on the James River where there's a whole--there's still a federal compound down there.  And most of the Parsons family in that time, so let's call it the mid to late 1800s, settled in Williamsburg.  But you know, my father's father and his immediately older brother, i.e., numbers twelve and thirteen, all good jobs were taken in Williamsburg, so they migrated down the river and set up shop in Newport News, and that's where my father was born.
Speaker 1: And they set up shop as?  What were they?  They were--
Speaker 2: They worked in the shipyard.
Speaker 1: In the shipyard, okay.
Speaker 2: My, my, my grandfather ultimately became a welder.
Speaker 1: How do you know this history on, on your father's side going back to--
Speaker 2: We were always much closer, we being myself and my siblings, always much closer to my father's family and their history and story than my mother's [Isabelle Judd Parsons] because my mother's mother [Anna Judd (ph.)] as I said, died when she was sixteen.  And my mother's father [William Judd (ph.)] died when I was three.  So the grandparents were gone on that side, and we had the, the--her siblings.  She had two brothers and three sisters, all of whom lived in New York and who we would see periodically but you know, grandparents hold it together, right.  So we would go and make the pilgrimage to Virginia every summer and stay for two to four weeks and really got sort of more imbued in that side of the family history.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that that history was actually talked about and passed down.
Speaker 2: Yeah as I--none of this was read by me.  I mean it was all someone told me.
Speaker 1: And they, did they take a lot of pride in the fact that your--it, it would have been your great-grandfather that was born, was a free man.  Is that right, your great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my great-grandfather was born in slavery and was freed in 1863.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay now I wanna go to what--well tell me about your father, though.  What would you say--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father was a very smart man, very gentle and gracious man.  My father was sort of the epitome of the true Virginia gentleman, you know he was a, thoughtful, refined, intelligent, gentle.  And resourceful in terms of intellectual resources.  And I think probably whereas I, I more associate you know sort of the grit and, and just sort of dogged determination that I can on occasion muster with my mother.  Whereas I think from my father I got more of the intelligence and gentility that he had in abundance.
Story_ID: 228625
Speaker 1: Now how did your parents [Lorenzo Parsons and Isabelle Judd Parsons] meet, do you know?
Speaker 2: I think they met at a dance, but I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: And you're the oldest of three--
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  I'm the second oldest of five.
Speaker 1: Five, I'm sorry, I'm sorry that's right.  I was thinking, oh, I see.  That's--this is wrong then, okay.  Now let me ask you can you give me your siblings' names in birth order?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  My oldest sibling is my older sister Loretta, her name is Loretta Donna [ph.] Parsons Poole, P-O-O-L-E.  I was second.  Next third child was my brother, Lorenzo Locklair [Parsons] Jr., AKA [Also Known As] Skip is what we called him, or Skippy, who was born, well let's see.  Loretta was born in August, August 14, 1946.  I'm April 4th as I told you, '48 [1948].  My brother Skip was born on March 7th, 1951, and he passed in--it was in the service, in 1972, during the [Vietnam] War.  And he passed sometime in March of '72 [1972].  The fourth child was my sister Janet, Janet Gayle [ph.] Parsons is her name and she was born on June, I'm thinking 8th of '52 [1952].  And then the baby, my baby sister Diane, Diane Iona [ph.] is her middle name, Parsons, was born on the 2nd of July, 1960.  And she's the baby.
Speaker 1: So you were somewhat stair steps in some respects--
Speaker 2: Yeah pretty much, except for the last one.  The love child.
Story_ID: 228626
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: Probably the apartment in which we lived.  We lived in Brooklyn [New York, New York], in the Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York, New York] section, in what they call one of those railroad flats.  And I remember--I sort of remember, I remember in those days my sister [Loretta Parsons Poole] and I shared a bedroom.  And I remember that apartment and I remember Pacific Street, the street we lived on.  Are you looking for incidents?
Speaker 1: Yeah, occasion, um-hm.
Speaker 2: Well one of the things I--I'll give you two.  One I remember, in those days you know to keep the garbage cans, which we would call the ash cans in those days, off the street, they had a little dugout under the buildings.  And you would, you would--there were some stairs you'd go down and the, the kids used to run and jump across the, in essence the little, what would you call it--cutout in the sidewalk.  And that was sort of the test of manhood.  And I remember being four or five years old the first time I ran and jumped across one of those openings.  'Cause if you didn't make it, you know it was like instant death.  You crashed and burned down in the cinder alley.  That I remember.  I remember living across the street from the armory, there was a huge armory on--Atlantic Avenue Armory [23rd Regiment Armory, New York, New York] it was called, which also backed up on Pacific Street, which was the street we lived on.  And going across the street and playing, you know you throw a ball against the wall and catch it.  I mean that's what kids in the city did for fun.  I remember the trolleys.  I remember riding on the trolleys.  I remember the [Brooklyn] Dodgers [Los Angeles Dodgers], I was a big Dodger fan when I was five years old.  So my father [Lorenzo Parsons] took me to a Dodger game in sometime in '53 [1953].
Speaker 1: And that was a big deal.  Now--
Speaker 2: That was a big deal.  That was a big deal.  I remember Coney Island [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: You were how old when you went to Coney Island, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Well, probably the first time we--we probably, I got dragged along, you know, as a kid.  But first time I remember I was four or five years old.  You actually remember like the rides, the boardwalk and stuff like that.
Story_ID: 228627
Speaker 1: Can you describe the block that you grew up on?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember any of the neighbors, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember.  Well on our block, our block, we lived on Pacific Street [Brooklyn, New York, New York] and Bedford Avenue was one, it was probably to the, it was the western boundary and Nordstrom Avenue was the eastern boundary and Pacific Street ran west to east or east to west.  And we had a hospital on the corner.  And then a series of, of the sort of railroad flat, rental units, maybe six of them in a row, four, five stories high probably.  And then there was a, a larger multi-family, it was almost like an old hotel that had become an SRO, Single Room Occupancy place at--close to the other, to the Nordstrom Avenue, and then there was a, a little grocery store what we now call a bodega, delicatessen, on the corner.  On our side of the street, which was the, I guess you would call it the north side of Pacific Street.  On the south side of Pacific Street was the back side of this gigantic armory [23rd Regiment Armory, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now do you, when you talk about railroad flats, how do they, how do those differ from brownstones?
Speaker 2: Well brownstones are whole houses, you know and the big stoops and all this.  The railroad flats were basically front to back, straight line, so that everything was in a line.  You would come in through the kitchen, I mean excuse me, come in through the living room and you walk past the living room and then there was a kitchen over here, and then you'd walk and there was a bedroom over here, and then there was in some of them another bedroom and then the back bedroom.  And ours I think it was three bedrooms altogether.  In fact I think it was two bedrooms, but it was a big living room, kitchen, my parents' [Lorenzo Parsons and Isabelle Judd Parsons] room and then in back room, my sister [Loretta Parsons Poole] and I shared that back room.  It just was a straight, like a big railroad car.  Like, like an apartment would like like if you built it inside a railroad car.  That's why they're called railroad flats.
Speaker 1: Now why were you roommates with your sister, not your brother [Lorenzo Parsons, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Because my brother wasn't born--
Speaker 1: At the time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) until, yeah until 1951.  So, and they had a crib and I think they put that wherever--
Speaker 1: Okay that's right.
Speaker 2: --and that's when ultimately they outgrew this place and that's when we--
Speaker 1: And that's when you moved.
Story_ID: 228628
Speaker 1: Can you take me back to that--to Pacific Street [Brooklyn, New York, New York]?  Can you take me back there and tell me what sights, smells and sounds remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?  You can't take, you can't do that until you get to Jamaica [Queens, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah because I don't remember.  I mean first of all, smells and sounds--
Speaker 1: That's fine, you can do (unclear).  Can we talk about your move?  You know when--do you remember your parents [Lorenzo Parsons and Isabelle Judd Parsons] talking about the move?
Speaker 2: No I don't remember them talking about it, but I remember the move because it was traumatic.  We moved from Brooklyn [New York, New York] which was, you know the center of the known world, to Queens [New York, New York], which was as my other relatives would call it, the country.  I mean it was like out in the sticks.  It was out where, where JFK [John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York] now is.  In those days it was a small airport there called Idlewild [Airport, New York, New York], this was in 1953, toward the end of '53 [1953].  And it was, it was all built on a swamp, you know that landfill.  So we were surrounded by--we had swamps and woods.  It was, there was an [U.S.] Army, literally an Army camp about a block from my house.  And, and the place would flood every time it rained.  I mean it was just, it was like totally night and day from, from civilization, which is what we all thought, at least I thought of Brooklyn as.  So I was not a happy guy initially.
Speaker 1: You were eight years old?
Speaker 2: No, I was five and a half.
Speaker 1: Wait--'48 [1948], '53 [1953], okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Five and a half.
Speaker 1: And so, so you weren't a happy camper.
Speaker 2: Not initially, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it grew on you, right?
Speaker 2: Eventually.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 228629
Speaker 1: Now the place that you moved to, was it a community there?  Would you say it was a block?
Speaker 2: Well yeah, it definitely was a block.  It was a community in formation.  When we moved to Queens [New York, New York], we moved to a place called South Ozone Park.  Which as I said, it was just--
Speaker 1: South Roseland Park?
Speaker 2: South Ozone, O-Z-O-N-E Park.  Which was just north of what is now JFK [John F. Kennedy] International Airport [New York, New York].  That whole part of Queens, southern Queens was being developed so that for example, the street that I lived on extended further south toward the airport than any of the adjoining streets.  By that I mean I lived on 143rd Street, 144th [Street], 145th [Street] hadn't yet been built down to where we were, and there was an old neighborhood.  This was the, the newer neighborhood was being built next to.  But it was definitely a block and we had the very clear concept of, you know, your block and the kids on your block and the next block, and--
Speaker 1: So what was that block like that you lived on?
Speaker 2: That block changed over time.  We, I think we were the, we were the first, well we were the first black family to move there.  There was one woman, Mrs. Brown [ph.] who actually lived next door to us, who was black or African American as we now say.  But she was a, a, a widower.  She had a son but he had been grown and lived someplace else.  And so we were the first family with kids to move on that block.  It was mostly Italian and Irish when we, when we got there.  And then over the course of the ensuing let's say four or five years, it became almost all black.
Story_ID: 228630
Speaker 1: So can you talk about that, that neighborhood and what sights, smells and sounds remind you?
Speaker 2: Yeah I can, because you know I'm now sort of into my six to twelve part of the formative years.  That's when you remember things.  It was as I say, we lived at the dead end.  143rd Street in those days only came down to literally our house.  It dead-ended at a place called Old South Road.  We lived on the corner, 143rd and Old South Road.  So to the south of us was a woods called the Canary Woods [ph.], which as a five year old boy is a little intimidating.  But as a seven to nine year old boy, it's the greatest place in the world to go hang out in the woods, make forts and whatnot.  So we spent a lot of time in the woods, in the Canary Woods.  And then there was this [U.S.] Army camp as I said that would--you'd have to walk by.  See in Brooklyn [New York, New York], everything was on the corner.  If you wanted to go to the cleaners, it was one on the corner.  If you wanted to go to the grocery store, there was one on the corner.  If you wanted to go to the movies, there's one on the corner.  And Queens [New York, New York] in those days you had to walk to get to places.  So to get to the local deli, which was called K and A's [ph.], you had to walk by this Army base.  And they were as I mentioned earlier, they were building new houses, part of this new development in South Ozone Park [Queens, New York, New York], over from us.  So there was a lot of construction, so it was a big construction site, which is also a wonderful place to go and hang out and have fun if you're an eight year old boy.  So the sights were of a more rural kind of bucolic setting.  The sounds were, were those that come from the woods as well as from construction sites and so on and so forth.  There was not, was not a lot of traffic.  As I said, we lived on a, on a dead end street.  In Brooklyn we lived on a street where there was constant traffic back and forth and there trolley cars and things of that nature.  It wasn't any of that in Queens in 1953, at least in (unclear) Queens where we, where I grew up.  It was more, it was more--I remember as a kid doing things like pole rafting through the swamps whenever a big rain would come through cause the swamps would just fill up again and you know, you'd be, you'd be surrounded by three, four feet of water once you went down the hill.  And, and you know, camping out in the woods or building forts in the woods and doing things that, that sound like you live in the country.
Speaker 1: Would you hear crickets at night?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: Cause you don't hear crickets anymore.
Speaker 2: No, no.  And I'll tell you what in terms of sights.  In those days the night sky, I mean you can still see the Milky Way in New York [New York].  At night when you lived in Queens, southern Queens, to boot, there was no ambient light.  You know the airport which was then called Idlewild [Airport; John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, New York], it was so far away at that point in time, it was, you didn't see any lights from there and it wasn't that busy, right.  And at night time the sky would light up like, like it does in Kansas still, you know.
Speaker 1: So what about smells?  Any smells that remind you?
Speaker 2: Not so much of Queens.  I mean there are smells that, that are evocative, right, in terms of putting you in another place.  I remember, I remember, I still remember the smells of Christmas.  You know, new Christmas tree, you know that, that evergreen scent that, that comes, or your mom's [Isabelle Judd Parsons] cookies, she was a big cookie baker.  But that's--I don't have a smell that I associate with Queens as opposed to Brooklyn.  Now it's not true when I got to Hawaii, I do have a smell that's associated with that, but we'll get there--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in the fullness of time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Story_ID: 228631
Speaker 1: Describe to me what your home life was like and you know, we could start with, you know, you mentioned Christmas.  But I just--I'm just trying to understand what, you know, what was, you know what was, what was a, a normal time with the family, you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah in, in, in our case it all seemed so terribly normal.  It could have been 'Leave it to Beaver' right.  There were for the most of my growing up in terms of recollections, there the four kids cause as I said my, my baby sister [Diane Parsons] wasn't born until I was twelve.  And then well I, I remember that, that period of time, I left home four years later.  And so she wasn't really part of the, you know growing up six through twelve period which is, which is intense.  So it was the four of us and my mom [Isabelle Judd Parsons] and my pop [Lorenzo Parsons].  Now my father worked, my mother worked at home, was a homemaker.  So we usually--one of the things she did was she would look after other people's kids.  So there was usually one or two kids around who weren't sisters or brothers, but who were kids my mom would look after after school or stuff like that.  So there were always kids around and we would, and we did what kids did.  You know you played in the yard, you played in the woods, you went to school.  We, the family ate as a family every evening in terms of dinner when my father got home.  My mom would get up and fix breakfast for everybody in the mornings.  It was, it was in some respects sort of classically American, middle class existence.  Probably lower middle class.  But everybody seemed to be in the lower middle class in those days, or at least in our neighborhood.  So you, you, I never felt like we stood out one way or another.  Like we were anything other than part of the great unwashed, you know.
Story_ID: 228632
Speaker 1: Were you a churchgoing family?
Speaker 2: Yeah we were.
Speaker 1: What religion?
Speaker 2: Lutheran.
Speaker 1: Lutheran okay.  We don't interview many Lutherans.
Speaker 2: Yeah I think it's because you know when I think back on it, that was, there was a Lutheran church in the neighborhood and there was a Catholic church, and we weren't Catholic, so we went to the Lutheran church.  But that's how I was raised.
Speaker 1: Now was, was your, was it, was it a black Lutheran church?
Speaker 2: At the time when we started, no.  When we ended, yes.  You know as the neighborhood changed, the church changed.
Speaker 1: So were you active participants in that church?  I mean in terms of the--I don't even know the Lutheran theology.
Speaker 2: I was twelve years in a row without missing a Sunday, except during the summer when I'd go to my aunt--my, my grandmother's [Harriet Parsons (ph.)].
Speaker 1: How does it differ from other--what do Lutherans believe? Isn't that British (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, it's Protestant, it's Protestant.
Speaker 1: Right it came out of Great Britain, right?
Speaker 2: Germany.
Speaker 1: Germany.
Speaker 2: Germany, Martin Luther.  Probably the most, the, the--you know in terms of the evolution of the Protestants, Lutheran is somewhere in the middle between Episcopal, which is really the old Anglican church, right in England which was just one step removed from Catholics.  So Catholic, Episcopal, then Lutheran, then Methodist, then Baptist.
Speaker 1: So okay I can get with that, okay.  Now you--so how as the time in the church then?  Were you active participants?
Speaker 2: Of course we were.  Don't I look like a churchgoing guy?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay I didn't mean it that way.  But I mean were active in Sunday school, active in activities, you know?
Speaker 2: Yeah and the church was--
Speaker 1: The name of the church, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Was Good Shepherd Lutheran Church [New York, New York].  And the church was not central, not exclusively, a source of exclusive centrality to our family life.  But it was very much incorporated into the family life so that for example, the Boy Scouts [of America] and the Girl Scouts [of the United States of America].  I was a Boy Scout and my sister was a Girl Scout.  Brownies and Cubs, my brother was a Cub and my sister, baby sister was a Brownie.  Church camp, all of those sorts of things.  Yeah we did, we did the whole nine [yards].
Story_ID: 228633
Speaker 1: The neighborhood [South Ozone Park, Queens, New York, New York] became black in time.
Speaker 2: Originally I think it was probably German.
Speaker 1: But the, the membership of the church [Good Shepherd Lutheran Church, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: German, there were a lot of Germans.  You know this is, this was, this is a classic New York [New York] community although unlike Brooklyn [New York, New York] where, where this sort of--neighborhoods retained their ethnicity for far longer over many more generations than in Queens [New York, New York].  Queens was, Queens--the development in Queens was, was, it was like a staging ground.  So as, as waves of immigrants moved out of Brooklyn, moved to Queens and they stayed there for a while and then they moved on to the island, Long Island [New York] and they kept moving further and further out.  And they would leave neighborhoods and the next wave of immigrants would come through and so on and so forth.  So you know, we still had a few old Germans left in the hood when we got there, but it was mostly Italian and Irish, which was the next waves of immigrants to come through.  And the blacks replaced them and now in large parts of where I grew up and that area of Queens, it's Korean and that's the newest.  I mean in parts of Main Street now you can't, you, you won't see a sign in English for the first seven or eight blocks, it's all Korean.
Speaker 1: So you're saying in many ways it's a transitional community.
Speaker 2: It was, yes.  Queens was, was more of a transitional type place than Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Place that you go on your way to someplace else.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Now did your parents [Lorenzo Parsons and Isabelle Judd Parsons] end up living there for a long time, though?
Speaker 2: Yes.  They lived there from 1953 until, well my father died in 1998, and my mother died in 2004.
Story_ID: 228634
Speaker 1: What other things do you remember about growing up in that house?  Well just--why are you laughing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (laughter) We don't have that much time.
Speaker 1: Okay we don't have that much time, but--
Speaker 2: I remember everything.
Speaker 1: Well do you, okay, do you--is there any--let me ask you to share two memories with, two memories with us.
Speaker 2: Well one we, I think we, did we talk about it a little bit on the show ['An Evening With Richard Parsons']?  I mean I did burn my house down.
Speaker 1: No you did not talk about that on the show.
Speaker 2: Well we need to talk about it.  I do remember that.
Speaker 1: But can you talk about that?  You never, no you didn't mention.  You talked about your father [Lorenzo Parsons] having you, but I think you were younger about bringing bricks up in young (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No that was also in the house in Queens [New York, New York].  I remember, I'll give you two.  One is when I was seven I was one of those, you know, fascinated by matches and I was--we were home from school.  My kid brother [Lorenzo Parsons, Jr.] and kid sister [Janet Parsons] were upstairs sleep.  My mother [Isabelle Judd Parsons] was just down the block with a neighbor and my older sister [Loretta Parsons Poole] and I were supposedly doing our homework or something and I was playing with matches in the closet.  Back in those days, nowadays you have the, the plastic garment bags they put over a garment when it comes from the cleaners.  In the old days they had paper, right.  Paper went up, the house went up.  We got my mother, I called--fortunately we lived right across the street from one of those fire boxes, so I got the fire guys there.  My mother went in and got my sister and my brother out, got burned.  Got to go to the hospital.  But ultimately everybody was fine.  She was the only one that was injured.  And her injuries were relatively superficial.  She lost some hair and stuff like that, and spent half a day in the hospital, but the house burned down.  So we had to, we had to go live with my grandmother [Harriet Parsons (ph.)] for months in [Newport News] Virginia while they rebuilt the house.
Speaker 1: You know what I find amazing about this story?  You don't--did you feel guilty at all?
Speaker 2: Well of course I did.  But you get over it.  You know it was an accident.  I was just grateful that my father did not kill me.  But you know, as I said he was, he was always--my father was very thoughtful and ultimately a very gentle man.  It doesn't mean that he was necessarily a spare the rod and spoil the child guy.  He was the disciplinarian among the two.  But what are you going to do?
Story_ID: 228635
Speaker 1: So what's your other memory?
Speaker 2: I guess the other memory I would have about that house [in Queens, New York, New York] and there are just so many cause it's the house in which I grew up, right.  I was there from five to sixteen.  And that's when most of your childhood memories are from.  I guess the other memory I would say about that house per se, is helping my father [Lorenzo Parsons], when I got a little older, say twelve or so, with his never ending home improvement projects.  So one for example as I told you, we built a car port and we put in all those Belgian cobblestones as the driveway.  And he decided--he completed the basement.  The houses when they were built and sold, basement, main floor, second floor.  The only part of the house that was finished was the main floor.  So my father and, and the guy who turned out to be his best friend in the neighborhood, a guy named Pat Brady [ph.], Irishman, lived down the hill, completed the upstairs.  They built bedrooms upstairs and did that.  Then my father got it into his head as I got a little older, he wanted to complete the basement.  So he completed the basement and put a playroom down there and workshop for himself and laundry room for my mom [Isabelle Judd Parsons].  And then someone told him that it was not a good idea, particularly after I burned the house down, to have only way of entrance and you know, egress and exit.  So he decided to put a, an outside door in, which mean you had to dig a huge hole next to the house, down by the foundation, go through the foundation and put a door.  So I was assigned the job of digging the huge hole.  It took me almost all summer.  It took about eight weeks to dig this hole, it was gigantic, but I did it.  I was maybe twelve.
Story_ID: 228636
Speaker 1: So were you involved with all your father's [Lorenzo Parsons] home improvement projects?
Speaker 2: Many of them.
Speaker 1: Now what was your relationship with your father?  You're the oldest son.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Was there that expectation, even though you weren't--officially junior [Lorenzo Parsons, Jr.] was there?
Speaker 2: No you know, it's interesting.  I have heard this, I heard this when I was having kids myself.  That it's almost a blessing to have--if you're going to have two children or more and they would be of opposite sex, have the girl first.  Because they sort of absorb some of that enthusiasm for building the perfect person.
Speaker 1: Perfect child.
Speaker 2: Yes.  So now my father, I don't ever remember having a feeling, the burden of expectation, other than general.  I mean you were, you know, you were supposed to go to school to get good grades and you know, they certainly expected me not to burn the house down a second time and they expected me to behave and go to church and normal stuff.  But, but no one ever put on me that you know you're, you have this special burden to carry.  So I was, I was, I was relatively unencumbered by outside expectations.  I was allowed pretty much to just find my own way.
Speaker 1: Now you, you know you talked about being, you know, you know some times you're on and sometimes you aren't.  Was that just a natural part of sort of growing up, you know and, and you as a person or did it speak to really you know, some personality trait that you had to work against.
Speaker 2: Well against or with, I'm not sure.  I think, it's hard to say, it's just part of growing up because everybody doesn't experience the same thing.  It just depended on where I was at the point in time in my life.  There were times when, when, when my focus was on what was going on in school.  And then were times when my focus was on what was going on outside of school.  And it would depend on those times.
Speaker 1: Did that cause any conser--I mean any concern on the part of your parents?  You know the lack of consistency.  Would your mother [Isabelle Judd Parsons] or your father comment about that?
Speaker 2: Not really because, because you know wherever the bar was, right, I was always, I could always clear the bar relatively comfortably.  So, and my parents for better or worse, weren't the kind that, you know, demanded A's.  They just--my, my problems were in what, what were called in those days a tasteful word, deportment.  And so long as, as I said, as I wasn't breaking things or, or you know, creating some sort of irreparable damage across the countryside they--the grades, whatever grades I got seemed to be fine by them.
Speaker 1: So deportment in terms of the area of deportment, what you weren't carrying yourself the right way, or I mean or what--
Speaker 2: No, I was just always in trouble.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In school trouble?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Getting in fights, or talking back or being--
Speaker 2: You know, trouble comes in, trouble comes in all kinds of flavors.  I mean you name a flavor, I'd find a way to get in trouble.  Not--now interesting, not bad trouble, not trouble from which you couldn't with a spanking and a lecture, you know, sort of be redeemed.  But just mischief.  Just because as I said, there were times when school wasn't really all that consuming.  School was actually relatively easy for me.  And so it, it wasn't a question of having to work hard even when you were engaged.  It's just the question of where your head was at at a given moment in time.
Story_ID: 228637
Speaker 1: I want to ask you to really describe yourself in those early, you know in the early years.  I mean were you a person who was--were you a thinking child?  Were you--you know you described yourself as mischievous.  I mean what was actually going on in, you know inside your--
Speaker 2: I can describe physical attributes and behaviors.  I can't tell you want was going on inside my head.  I can't tell you today.  As I said, I had, I had the ability to do academic work at whatever level I needed to do it at any given point in time.  And I sort of, I think I knew that and therefore as I say, if a teacher had engaged you or a subject matter engaged you, you would pursue it because it was interesting to you.  If not, you would just--you did what you needed to do to get by and you would pursue other things.  I was curious.  I liked science and math and I liked the physical world.  So as a kid you know when I was, I don't, ten we started going to the [American] Museum of Natural History [New York, New York] on the weekends and I got into astronomy and stuff.  I was industrious.  I've worked since was twelve.  I had multiple paper routes and stuff like that.  I could always make money, always.  And while money itself doesn't fascinate so much, what money can do was something that I understood early on and could always figure out how to make whatever I needed to do whatever I wanted to do.  So I was a worker, much more so than I was a student.
Story_ID: 228638
Speaker 1: So what kind of jobs did you have?
Speaker 2: You name one, I had one.
Speaker 1: Newspaper--
Speaker 2: I did newspapers, I was a short order cook, I was a, I drove a school bus, I caddied, I parked cars.  Anything that a kid could do.  I once worked as a bartender, as a janitor.  Anything that you could do you know, before your twentieth birthday, I mean I did it.
Speaker 1: So all that, that sense of industry was really encouraged by your parents [Lorenzo Parsons and Isabelle Judd Parsons], though and supported (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It wasn't, it was supported.  It certainly wasn't discouraged and yeah I, I think I mentioned this in the other show ['An Evening With Richard Parsons'].  My father's view was that you had to work for what you wanted in this world.  So he, he--so one thing you know you can't remember everything about the way you were parented.  But one of his tricks I call it that I, I, I took from him and used when I had my own children.  'Cause kids, kids have an endless appetite for things that they want, right.  There's an endless list of can I have this, can I have that, can I have the other thing.  And you always, you can get yourself into a box in terms of well you can have this, but you can't have that because they want to know why can't they have that.  My father's view was you can have almost anything you want, but you pay half and I'll pay half.  It sounds so eminently sensible, right?  So eminently fair.  Like that, that's good--I--he's in for half and I'm in for half.  Well that's a real constraining and restraining factor on your appetite.  So it was encouraged in that sense.  I wasn't, I wasn't told that I had to go get a job, but I was told that if I wanted the things I wanted, I was going to have to pay for them to some extent, and that meant you had to get a job.
Speaker 1: Was that all the kids that he treated that way or--
Speaker 2: Not my sisters.
Speaker 1: With the boys.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Story_ID: 228639
Speaker 1: You know you talk about your love of baseball; you liked science and math.  What other things are forming you as a young person, are there people outside, who, like who were some of your friends or the people outside that are influencing you?
Speaker 2: Undoubtedly, although one really comes to mind as an influence--I had a lot of friends.  I like sports.  By the time I was ten, I was big enough to really participate in sports, I like sports, I liked them all, baseball, basketball, football, anything that was sports.  And so I was on a lot of teams and had a lot of friends in the respect.  I would say my father [Lorenzo Parsons] was the most influential person in my upbringing.  My father was the man that I wanted to and assumed I would grow up to be like.  I had uncles, my father had three brothers, my mother [Isabelle Judd Parsons] had two brothers.  And they were all good uncles but not--I don't think of any of them as being massively influential on my upbringing.  I'd say if I had to pick one person, it would be my grandmother [Harriet Parsons (ph.)].
Speaker 1: Why is--tell me about your grandmother then.
Speaker 2: Well my grandmother, let's see, my father's father [Eastwick Parsons (ph.)], my grandfather, had a stroke when I was five years old.  And it was a massive stroke and he was largely debilitated from that point.  He lived another thirteen years, but he lived in a wheelchair and basically couldn't speak, he could move his left arm and the left side of his face.  That was it.  So he ceased to be you know, a person who you could communicate with and would be influential in that way.  My grandmother on the other hand, my grandma was the sort of classic grandmom in the Old South sense of the word.  First of all, she could cook like nobody's business, and she loved her grands and she would--there was no amount of time that she wouldn't spend with her grands when she could be with them.  She would come to New York [New York] every year, usually with my grandfather and spend some time with us and then we were sent to [Newport News] Virginia in the summer times for, as I say anywhere--minimum two weeks, sometimes a month, sometimes six weeks, to live with my grandmother.  And so she was, you know and she was, she was my favorite.  I loved my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Why is that?
Speaker 2: Well she was sweet and she was kind and she was gentle and she was grandmotherly, you know, she had that big bosom that she would clutch you to whenever anything went wrong.  She loved, you know, grandparents love unreservedly, right.  'Cause they can always send you home when you get to be a nuisance.  And she did all the things that I relate to, like cook good food.  I mean grandmom could cook, and she was, she was a reverent lady, she was a thoughtful lady.  She had wisdom--you know you could almost--that comes from just living life and seeing a lot.  And she was genuine and good.
Story_ID: 228640
Speaker 1: What were the ages that you were spending time in, you know in the South, in South Carolina, what were those?  In [Newport News] Virginia, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Virginia.  Until I was sixteen years old.  Spent lots of time in the summer times.
Speaker 1: So those times were, you know you, you would be around other kids, or were you--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well first of all, there were four of us, right.  Then I had a bunch of cousins and other kids in the neighborhood--what passes for neighborhoods in Virginia.  So it was, it was very different.  Virginia in those days.  I mean when we started going down there it was still segregated, right.  And it was a different world in New York [New York].  But, but, but my grandmother [Harriet Parsons (ph.)] was the ultimate in caregiving.  It didn't get any better than grandmom when it came to that.
Speaker 1: And she never came to live up here with you, even after--
Speaker 2: No.  For a while she sent my grandfather [Eastwick Parsons (ph.)].  We brought him up here and put him in, I think one of the, Burke [ph.], one of the, the--
Speaker 1: Houses.
Speaker 2: --the rehabilitation places, and we--he was, my grandfather was here for maybe three or four months and my great-grandmother, Nanny [ph.], came to live with us for a half a year or so and drove me crazy.  But my grandmother stayed in Virginia always.  Remember she had seven other kids, most of them lived in the neighborhood.  Twenty-some odd other grandchildren, I mean you know.
Story_ID: 228641
Speaker 1: Now when you're--you said--so you were--your father [Lorenzo Parsons] was the one who influenced you.  What would he tell you about yourself?  Like would he tell you that, you know, you could grow up to be this?  Or would he tell you, you know, you have to watch out about yourself with this?  I mean you're saying he didn't, you know he was most influential and I'm just wondering when you hear things now, are there things that remind you about what he said, or--
Speaker 2: Less so what my father said.  My father was a very smart man, he really was.  He was a clever fellow.  It wasn't necessarily deeply philosophical and moreover, when I say he was an influence, I just watched my father, whatever my father did, you know I sort of incorporated that.  Someone once asked me--I remember when I became chairman of the (unclear), said well when did it first occur to you that you could, you know, grow up to be chairman?  But it never occurred to me that I didn't.  My father didn't need to say to me--now my mother [Isabelle Judd Parsons] would say things like well you can be anything you want in life.  My father wouldn't say something like that, or if he did it just wouldn't have registered in the same way because he sort of came from the same perspective I did.  I mean why would you think you couldn't?  I mean what would 'cause you to think you couldn't do or be or get to wherever it was you wanted to go?
Story_ID: 228642
Speaker 1: So now are you at all influenced about, with what's happening racially in this country?  Is that being discussed at, you know, at home and things like that?  I mean is that, because--
Speaker 2: You mean in this time?  In the '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm '50s [1950s] and the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Although it's not, it was not topic one, first of all.  As I said, it was a very, there's a distinct difference between living in the North and living in the South.  Secondly, most of my father's [Lorenzo Parsons] job, and therefore many of my father's friends, were with majority companies and, and he had a number of white friends.  But we lived in a neighborhood [South Ozone Park, Queens, New York, New York] that was becoming increasingly black and we were always having barbeques and stuff like that.  And then there's the relatives.  So it was, you know I, I kind of grew up in, in a world where for me coming from home and based on the interactions I had outside of the home, race was not the quintessential or predominant issue or thing on people's minds.  There would be times when it would flare, particularly when you got into the '60s [1960s], but it wasn't the organizing principle for life.
Story_ID: 228643
Speaker 1: The junior high and high school you went to, were they mixed? Like what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah they were.  Now the elementary school was probably still in those days predominantly white, although an increasing number of, of blacks.  So it was maybe, I don't know, 25, 30 percent black and the rest white.  The junior high school because it was sort of a different cut, took an older neighborhood that had really gone black was, was largely, was maybe the opposite, maybe 60, 70 percent black and 30 percent white.
Speaker 1: And that's--
Speaker 2: That was [Edgar D.] Shimer Junior High School [Queens, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Shoomer?
Speaker 2: Shimer.
Speaker 1: Shimer, okay.
Speaker 2: And then the high school I went to, which, which drew from an even bigger area, was about 25 percent black, 25 percent Jewish, and then 50 percent Italian with a few Germans thrown in there.
Speaker 1: Now were you, did you play on the team in high school?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Bask--
Speaker 2: Basketball.
Speaker 1: Basketball team.  So you were, were you one of the stars of the team?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, that stardom eluded me, but I played--
Story_ID: 228644
Speaker 1: Now when, you told the whole story of how you chose University of Hawaii [at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii] to go to.  Can you, I mean your parents [Lorenzo Parsons and Isabelle Judd Parsons], what were your mother's thoughts about you going and your father's thoughts?
Speaker 2: My mother, my mother was mortified.  She was literally mortified, she cried.  Because I'd just turned sixteen when I was, when I left, right.  And she said, "Larry, you know, you can't let this boy go out there."  She didn't even really know, she didn't know anything about Hawaii.  It was just a word to her.  It was way out in the ocean somewhere.  Far as she knew it was like a foreign country.  Go out to Hawaii, you don't even know anybody out there, he's only sixteen years old.  My father's view was you know, he, he had a very interesting perspective on this.  When I turned thirteen, it was almost as if the guy was, was you know, part of the, the Judeo part of the Christian/Judeo ethic and he says, "Oh, today, you know you are a man and so you know, men make their own decisions and find their own way in this world."  And he pretty much stuck to that.  He didn't, he, he, he was not very directive after I turned thirteen.  He, he only really got after me once, that's a nice way of saying clobbered me cause he thought I'd cursed at my mother, which I did not.  He mis--he misheard me, but I was being rude anyway.  So he clobbered me for that.  But other than that I don't recall him, if you will, interfering in my life.  He was, he was a dad, he was supportive, put food on the table and so on and so forth, but you figured out where you wanted to go on your own and if you needed his help, he was there for you, for his half.  So he was like, "Hey Isabelle, if the boy wants to go to Hawaii and he can figure it out, let him go to Hawaii."
Speaker 1: So do you remember the whole discu--I mean when--did you just come home one day and say I've gotten accepted and I'm going to go?  Or did they know you had gotten accepted--
Speaker 2: Well they, I, I told them what I had put down on this SAT.  That my mother just, you know, was immediately dismissive because hey we didn't have any money and so she knew I was going to go to CCNY [City College of New York, New York, New York] anyway, so she just put it out of her head.  Then as things began to sort take form, I said, "No, I'm really going to go to Hawaii."  She, she went into a bit of a all out sprint to head this off.  But, but she needed to get my father on board and his view was the boy wants to go to Hawaii and he can pay for it, let him go to Hawaii.
Speaker 1: So there were, were there any arguments with the two of them over your going?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  Not in my presence, there weren't.  My guess is there were discussions, but in my presence, no there were no arguments.
Speaker 1: Now who was your best friend at the time?
Speaker 2: A man named Richie [ph.] Lohse.  He was then a kid, a kid named Richie Lohse who I went to high school with.
Speaker 1: Lowenstein?
Speaker 2: Lohse, L-O-H-S-E, German.
Speaker 1: So what did he think of you going away?
Speaker 2: He thought it was cool.
Story_ID: 228645
Speaker 1: Do you remember the day that you arrived [at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii]?  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah I do, I remember it was an evening.  I must have gotten to Hawaii, I would say it's maybe nine o'clock at night.
Speaker 1: First of all it's a long trip.
Speaker 2: It's a long trip.  It's a long, long trip.
Speaker 1: I mean it's one thing going to Virginia, this is--
Speaker 2: No, no, it's a long trip.  Even on a plane.  It's--with layovers and everything, ten, twelve hours.
Speaker 1: Did you fly to San Francisco [California] first, or--
Speaker 2: You would either fly to San Francisco or L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and then fly from there to Hawaii, so you take it in two bites.  And all in, it was about twelve hours, a long flight.  And then I remember getting off the plane.  In those days they had the, the, the portable gangways you know that they roll out to the plane and you walk down.  And I got off and I stood at the top of this thing for a minute and the air is different. I mean it's, it's very humid and damp, it's tropical trade winds or something.  And you could, and there's a dampness in the air that you don't--cause these are islands in the middle of the [Pacific] Ocean, right, that you don't get on the East Coast.  And I knew instantly that I was someplace different that I hadn't been before.  And that was the first time, literally getting off the plane, I said to myself, "What have I done?  I don't, I don't know anybody out here."  I didn't even have a plan for what I was going to do that evening.  I just, you know, as I said my father [Lorenzo Parsons] was, was the type of person who would say, "Well, you know, if he wants to do it, let him do it, you know.  He'll figure it out."  So I had a momentary panic attack.
Story_ID: 228646
Speaker 1: Turns out my planning left much to be desired in that I had no plan.  You know I just got accepted, I was going to go.  So I had to sort of figure out once I got there and was pushed off the stairs.  I thought gee, maybe I, maybe this is a mistake.  Maybe I should go back to New York [New York].  But I got a place to stay temporarily, found the University [of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii], got registered, got an apartment because basically they had very limited on-campus housing and most of it was reserved for local kids, Hawaiian kids from the outer islands.  So I got an apartment and found a roommate and eventually life fell into some sort of structured form.
Speaker 2: So had you saved up the money to go yourself?  So you had.
Speaker 1: I had plenty of money.
Speaker 2: Money was not your problem.
Speaker 1: I had plenty of money for the first six weeks till I spent it all.  I went crazy, you know.
Speaker 2: Because you're young, you don't anything about budgets or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Exactly, exactly.  I mean and young and stupid.  I mean my mother [Isabelle Judd Parsons] turned out to be more right than she knew.
Speaker 2: So how--what are you, I mean this all seems daunting in some respects.  But what are you finding out about yourself in, in the process?
Speaker 1: I would say what I learned in college, and I really can put it in a paragraph because I can't remember a single thing I learned in school.  What I learned in college was that I could take care of myself.
Speaker 2: It's that work ethic.
Speaker 1: At the end of the day. I could figure it out.
Speaker 2: So your father [Lorenzo Parsons] had really prepared you with this 50/50 deal.
Speaker 1: Well and a lot of other things.  A lot of other things you know, 'cause the, that's what--
Story_ID: 228647
Speaker 1: So you get married, you and Laura [Bush Parsons] move back to--
Speaker 2: Albany [New York].
Speaker 1: Oh, to Albany.  What, how does--you take the bar exam.  New York [State Bar Examination] is known as one of the hardest bar exams, well the hardest in the United States, and you score, you--do you score the top score or near the top?  Or the--
Speaker 2: I was told the top.
Speaker 1: Was that a surprise to you?
Speaker 2: You know it can't, nobody can expect that.  But it wasn't a huge surprise.
Speaker 1: Now why wasn't it a huge surprise?  Cause when--
Speaker 2: 'Cause, well, for example, for three years in law school [Albany Law School, Albany, New York] I had always gotten the top grades and, and I felt pretty good about the bar when I took it.  I, it came in like four installments, morning and afternoon on two successive days.  And the first three installments I, I thought I had nailed it.  The fourth one I was a little grumpy about.  I knew I blew one whole question.  But I never thought I would, I never thought I would--that I would fail or could fail, you know.  They mark these things on the curve.  You're always going to have at least 50, 60 percent of the people who pass, how could you not be in that not 50, 60 percent?  I'm saying to myself.  So actually the interesting story is how I found out I was in the bar.  I was working in the [New York] State Capitol [Albany, New York], I was working as a, as an apprentice lawyer, if you will, for [Governor] Nelson Rockefeller.  And it was a place across the street where everybody would fall after the sessions to have a drink and for the--wrap up the day.  And I was in this bar when a friend of mine who worked for the firm that, that does, that, that marks the bar exam came and said, "Well," he said--this was--cause nobody knew until December, this was right before Thanksgiving.  He said, "Well you know, I'm not supposed to say anything, but I can tell you you passed."  I said, "Well how do you know if they haven't put the curve on?"  He said, "'Cause you got the highest raw score."  And then my dean subsequently told me.  He said, "So wherever they draw the line, it's got to be under somebody, so it's gonna be under you."
Story_ID: 228648
Speaker 1: That's amazing.  Now how did you come to work for [Governor] Nelson Rockefeller?  You didn't tell that story.
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know--
Speaker 1: How did that--I mean is it--he's governor [of New York] at the time, right?
Speaker 2: He was governor, and he was--I had worked in my junior year at [Albany] Law School [Albany, New York] for the [New York] State Assembly as a legislative intern working on stuff.  And I had come into contact with various people in the governor's office.  I did not know him, but I had met some people in his office.  And he ran again for his fourth term in November 1970, the year that I was a senior.  And when he won, that's always a time when some people leave and some people stay and so on.  And there's a little bit of turnover.  I had never thought about working for the state.  I was going to come New York and work for a big Wall Street [New York, New York] firm or something like that, or work for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] Legal Defense Fund [NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc.].  But I, I got--now at this point we didn't get into either--you know I got, I, I almost got drafted when I was in law school because of the lottery.  So I joined the [U.S. Army] Reserves and I was away from school from mid-May at the end of my second year, till mid-November, past the beginning of my senior year.  So all the good jobs were gone by the time I got back to law school.  And I--one of my teachers knew his counsel who said you know, you got a guy up there, a kid up there who's pretty smart and you should send him down here, we'll give him a job.  And so I, my teacher sent me down, I got this job in the governor's office.  And, and then I met him subsequently.  So he didn't actually hire me directly.  It was only in subsequent incarnations that we formed a personal relationship.
Speaker 1: So when you, when you--the first job you got there, what were you doing?  Were you working on, doing research?
Speaker 2: I was an assistant counsel to the governor.  And what the assistant counsels did was in New York, you know where the attorney general is an elected official.  Okay so he's the lawyer for the people.  The governor has his own legal staff, very small, there were eight of us.  There was a counsel, a first assistant counsel and six assistants.  And I was one of them.  And we work on legislation and we work on other issues that the governor needs legal advice on in terms of being the chief executive officer of the state.
Speaker 1: Now when did you meet him then?  We know subsequently--
Speaker 2: Yeah I met him actually fairly shortly after I joined the office.  I, I was still in school when I, when I--
Speaker 1: You were in your third year.
Speaker 2: I was in my third year where I technically started in, in January of '71 [1971], yeah, January, late December, January of '71 [1971].  And he had a legislative gala, a ball at the [New York State] Executive Mansion [Albany, New York] where he would invite all the, the legislators who were coming back for the new session.  So it was late January.  And he would also invite his counsel because you know, we were the ones who worked with them and he'd invite, you know, members of his executive team so I was invited and that's where I met him first.  First time I met him was, was in a receiving line at his house for this gala.
Speaker 1: How did you get to know him, though?
Speaker 2: Well because you, you work with him.  He's the client of our office, right, of the counsel's office.  And over the course, I was there four years, and over the course of time, particularly after you've been there about a year and you have some expertise and, and you are the person who knows the answer and various stuff.  You would get some exposure to the governor.  He would want to know, he'd say, "Well I need to understand this better.  Get so-and-so in here or Mike," Mike [Michael] Whiteman was the counsel.  He'd say, "Bring whoever's working on this with you."  So you'd get to know him in that way.  And then he used to do these town halls where he would go around the state, you know and take over a gymnasium or something like that, and just have people come in so they could talk to the governor.  And he would take a small coterie of people from the state with him so that if he would say, somebody would ask him some arcane question and he'd say I don't know, but talk to my lawyer.  Or what do you think about this?  So through a series of different methods we became acquainted with each other.  And then I became, two years after I joined, I became the first assistant counsel.  And my job really was to carry the governor's water with the legislature.  I was in essence the principal legislative liaison.  So that involved a lot more exposure to him.
Story_ID: 228649
Speaker 1: So Mike [Michael Whiteman] is still the counsel and you're the first assistant.  Now that's a fascinating time though too, 'cause you're involved more in policy and you know, and the legislative process.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was.  It was, it was an interesting time and in many ways that was my, that was still my favorite job because it was a small office.  There were, as I said, there were eight of us.  Everybody with the possible exception of myself was high performing.  Working for [Governor Nelson] Rockefeller was a real charge.  Because he was a very dynamic and a good man.  And there was lots going on in that time.  I mean we did, we did--and not all of it was good, but it was all interesting.  We repealed a hundred year old abortion law in New York.  We created the state parks and, and you know, Attica [Prison riot] happened in that period of time, which was tragic.  It was just a lot happening in the state.
Speaker 1: So now how did you develop your relationship with him?  It's different--was it because you were doing such good work?  I mean that always--mentor/mentee relationships don't always develop that way.
Speaker 2: It's more, it's a function of exposure and chemistry, right.  Which is why it's hard to describe 'cause you can't describe the chemistry.  Certain people just like each other.  He liked me almost from the start, and I liked him enormously.
Story_ID: 228650
Speaker 1: Do you remember any discussion occurring, or the discussion between you when he [Governor Nelson Rockefeller] was getting ready to, you know, when he was tapped for vice president?  And you know you talked when we, when we first had our meeting you were saying you know how he said everyone was, you know they were going to be I think chief, I don't know if it was chief of staff or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, no--well when he was first tapped, my recollection was this was like September, right, 1974, four, September.  At that point in time, he had left the state [New York] already.  He had stepped down as governor at the beginning of that year to give Malcolm Wilson, you know sort of years, who had been his long time lieutenant governor, to sort of gather his forces and make the run for the--
Speaker 1: For the governor.
Speaker 2: --for the governorship.  And he had gone back and he had started something called the Commission on Critical Choices [for Americans], where they were, you know he was identifying the critical issues that were going to face America going forward.  And I didn't have a lot to do with that because I was busy up in Albany [New York].  I was working for Malcolm.  But when he became, when he was tapped for vice president--
Speaker 1: So you were working for Malcolm you said?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I stayed in my job.
Speaker 1: I see, you stayed in, okay.
Speaker 2: And he was doing this private thing in his Commission on Critical Choices.  Then shortly after he got nominated he said to me, I don't know where I ran into him, but I ran into him and he said, "Well would you be interested in coming to Washington [D.C.]?"  I said, "Well, you know, sure."  And he said, "Well just hang tight and we'll see what happens."  And it was a long running nomination or confirmation process, took 'til December.  Then he got confirmed in December, it was like the nineteenth or something and called and said, "All right, get down here."
Story_ID: 228651
Speaker 1: And so his [Nelson Rockefeller] team there [Washington, D.C.], it was you, who were the--it was four or five I thought.
Speaker 2: There were--he brought a bunch of people with him.  The four that you're thinking of were the ones he ultimately moved over to the White House [Washington, D.C.] staff in the Domestic Council (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, and they were you and--
Speaker 2: Well it was a fellow named Jim [James] Cannon, Art Quern [Arthur F. Quern] and myself, we were sort of the two deputies.  Jim was the assistant to the pres--became the assistant to the president on domestic policy and head of Domestic Council.  And who was the fourth, it was a fourth?  Oh, Dick Dunham, Richard [L.] Dunham who had been his budget director in New York, became the head of the Federal Energy Council.  Energy Regular--FERC it was called, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was another one that he gave up off of his staff to put into a lion job if you will, on the president's staff or presidential appointee.  But he still had a number of the people who came down to Washington [D.C.] with him who stayed on the vice president's staff.
Speaker 1: And in that, this working group, what were the key areas that you worked on?  You were saying that you were, you were over domestic, domestic policy issues, right, domestic?
Speaker 2: Yeah, now when I went to, when I first went down, I went as--I thought I was going to become counsel to the vice president.  And then when I got there, there was another guy who's name is Peter Wallace who thought he had been offered the counsel to the vice president.  Well like I said Nelson offered this, the same job.  But there were three people, all of whom thought they were going to be chief of staff to the vice president.  So we flipped a coin, literally, Peter and I, and he ended up being counsel and so I was the deputy counsel.  And I was there for--in the vice president's office, for four or five months.  And, but it was, it turned out to be an interesting four or five months.  The one thing we worked on, or that I worked on most intensively in that period of time was on what they call the Rule 22 amendment [cloture rule].  See if I can do this quickly.  Rule 22 is the, the rule in the [U.S.] Senate rule book that basically determines how you terminate or bring to closure a debate on something.  So it's a so-called closure rule.  And even now you're still--you're familiar with the fact that people say well it takes sixty senators to stop a debate.  So that even though you might have a majority of fifty-five or something like that, unless you have sixty senators, they can filibuster you to death in the Senate because you can't force a motion to bring the debate to a close requires nowadays, a sixty vote majority.  When we got there in 1975, late '74 [1974], early '75 [1975], the closure rule required two thirds, which means you had to have sixty-seven senators, which was how all the southern senators for years and years and years would filibuster the civil rights stuff to death.  And then it would never get done because they'd just stand up, talk and talk and talk and can never close the debate 'cause you couldn't get sixty-seven senators to do it.  So there was a movement on to liberalize the rule to go from sixty-seven to sixty, which is what it is today.  And so that was a battle that took about six or eight weeks and the vice president was key to it because under our [U.S.] Constitution, the vice president is the president of the Senate.  And whenever he shows up, he sits in the leadership chair and he's the guy that makes all the rulings on, on parliamentary matters and other matters that come before the house.  So we had this role to play and it was just--it was very interesting, it was very intense--
Story_ID: 228652
Speaker 1: It resulted in the changing of the rule [Rule 22; cloture rule], but it was very traumatic and very intense.  And then just about the time that quieted down was when I got moved over to the Domestic Council, and once on the Domestic Council, I was both the lawyer for the Domestic Council and I had, I was an associate director so I had [U.S.] Justice Department, [U.S.] Treasury Department, parts of HEW [U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare], the civil rights mechanisms of the government, and International Narcotics Control [Board].  Those were my subject matter areas that I was supposed to be the, the liaison to from, you know, how the president [President Gerald Rudolph Ford, Jr.] spoke to his executive officers and how they got back to him.
Speaker 2: So with--so that--talk about what you learned in terms of, of the federal government and the operation and how that differed from the, the state.
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: You're at a different level--
Speaker 1: In, in terms of, of difference, I thought Washington [D.C.] was, was just a far more intense and unpleasant place than the state government.  In Albany [New York], you know you have the legislative day and everybody would rail and yell and carry on, but you know at the end of the day, they all gathered in the same watering holes, they were all friends, they all had this sort of shared sense of you know, we're in this together.  I didn't find that in Washington.  I thought Washington was far more partisan and a far crueler place than Albany.  I mean the game, the level of the game just seemed to step up several notches.  You could get, you could get sideswiped, you could get, you know, annihilated in Washington and not even know why.  So there was a, it was a tougher place to get things done because it was far more partisan, in my sense of it, there was far less of a, less of a sense of, you know, sort of shared adventure or collaboration and it was more, it was more, more like a zero sum game, you know.  If you win, that means I must have lost.  Or the only way for me to win is for you to lose.  A little more mean spirited.  That's all on the negative.  On the positive side, you know, Albany was about, you know, the State of New York.  Washington was about what was going on in the world.  It was just a bigger, more varied, deeper, more interesting, more challenging, more complex set of issues.  Many of which had global dimensions.  So intellectually it was a much richer place to be.
Story_ID: 228653
Speaker 1: Do you think it was disappointing for--that experience was disappointing for [Nelson] Rockefeller?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.
Speaker 1: And because it was something he had wanted to do for some time, right?  And he was in the second (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was going to say he didn't want to be vice president for all that time--
Speaker 1: No, that's what I'm saying, I mean--
Speaker 2: --he wanted to be president and I think being vice president was a disappointment to him.  In fact, you know, 'til the day he died I always called him the governor, because, you know we all asked him at one point in time, "Well what would you, you want us to call you Mr. Vice President, want us to call you, you know, Governor, which is what--how do you want to be called?"  He said, "Call me the Governor, or call me Governor."  He, he liked being governor, he liked being in charge.  Vice presidents aren't in charge of much of anything.  And so not, not--I mean I think he, he took comfort in the fact that he did his duty as a citizen.  That was very important to Nelson Rockefeller.  But he did not find it a truly engaging assignment.
Story_ID: 228654
Speaker 1: Do you think your relationship [with Nelson Rockefeller] though during that period, did it become--wasn't it, it increased in that way?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay now why you among, you know amongst, you know sort of the others?
Speaker 2: Well first of all I had a lot more exposure to him in those days, lot more exposure from when we were at the State [of New York] to when we were in the federal government.  Daily exposure.  And almost all day daily.  And so we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that because he chose, that was his sort of niche that he was going to focus on was domestic issues, or I'm just, I'm wondering, okay.
Speaker 2: Well that was his background.  He liked, Nelson [Rockefeller] liked international stuff too.  But, but, but there were always issues that we were dealing with him on, like that whole Rule 22 [cloture rule] thing.  That was a real, that was you know, sort of battle, trial by fire or something.  And then that's when the chemistry part comes in, you know.  You just, some people you, you like.  He always thought I had good judgment and he always thought I was a bit of a risk taker.  So I think those were--and he just liked me.
Story_ID: 228655
Speaker 1: When you came back to, New York [New York] and you know, told Nelson [Rockefeller] that you wanted to go and you know because you said he always wanted you to run for president.  You said I can't do that, you know with, you know I need to have a different background--
Speaker 2: Yeah he wanted me, no he, his view or vision for me after a fashion was I should go on the [U.S.] Supreme Court.  And I said to him look, you can't, I can't get there from here.  I mean I'm--I've enjoyed working with you.  I worked with him as you know for, for the better part of a year.  But if I'm going to really be considered by all and sundry, you know, a top flight lawyer and so and so, I got to go spend some time in a legal firm learning the craft, trying lawsuits, doing that sort of stuff.  And he got that.  So I, I ultimately left and went to a place called Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now do you think you had such a success there?  Was it because he empowered you with a client base?
Speaker 2: No, no.  I mean that was helpful from my perspective, but no.  A, if there is such a thing, I, I, I was almost like a natural born lawyer.  That's why [Albany] Law School [Albany, New York] was easy and the bar and stuff like that.  It's just--
Speaker 1: It came easy to you.
Speaker 2: It came easy to me and that, that's kind of how my mind worked.  And so I was a good lawyer.  That, that's the foundation.  It's very hard to be successful among other lawyers if you aren't any good at the craft.  And then secondly, you know ultimately, it's the same sorts of reason I was successful with clients.  People trust you, they trust your judgment.  A, if you--you have a certain skill set.  But then the question is well yeah but who would you go to if you had a real problem, or if you needed somebody to organize something, or if you were going to follow somebody somewhere, you go to somebody you trust, right?  And so I would say it was a combination of decent legal skills, decent judgment, and being trustworthy.
Story_ID: 228656
Speaker 1: You said that you got, you know, that Laura [Bush Parsons] even said that you had become a a bit stale.  Even though you had risen to managing partner [at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, New York, New York], right?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And did that experience as managing partner sometimes that wears people out.  You know within the--cause they're not practicing, but they're managing, you know all the horses.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, well it certainly, being managing partner certainly required some change in the way I practiced law.  I used to try law suits, right?  You can't do that if you're a managing partner.  At least not the way I used to do it, which was to just absent yourself from everything else.  I wouldn't answer phone calls.  If I was on trial, I wouldn't get back to clients, I wouldn't do this.  I was, I was on trial, right.  But you can't do that if you're managing partner because there's something happening every day.  And by that time I also had some corporate clients and you can't just absent yourself from that.  So my practice was changing.  Managing a law firm, it's a business, required you know, I'm going to say 40 percent of your time.  But that all--it was all part of a piece it was that, you know, I had done now most of what you could do in a law firm.  And given my personality type, it was probably time to move on and do something different.
Speaker 1: And Dime [Savings Bank of New York; Dime Bancorp, Inc., New York, New York] had been, had been your--
Speaker 2: Client
Speaker 1: Client, so you know a lot about the bank.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What were the surprises that, you know, what you didn't know that, that surprised you know, that, that didn't--where you had to play catch up?
Speaker 2: Well the biggest surprise was what became known as the thrift crisis [savings and loan crisis], that was the biggest surprise.  When I went to the Dime, I, I assumed that it was a, it was a well-positioned, well capitalized and well run, large thrift in an area that was going to further consolidate, right.  And I thought my job would be going forward to build the bank into a larger, more national presence.  It was a regional bank, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut.  What in fact happened was that shortly after I joined the bank, the whole banking world went up in flames, five hundred thrifts failed.  We almost failed and it was like a total disaster.  And so I spent, I spent most of my--I was there seven years.  I spent five of those seven years basically saving this thing from going under the waves.
Speaker 1: Who was--does that time remind you of the time now?
Speaker 2: Yeah it is, yeah it does.
Speaker 1: Okay I mean with the, the whole--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Except the government wasn't bailing anyone out (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well they, they did come up with something called the RTC [Resolution Trust Corporation], right?  And that ultimately--
Speaker 1: Resolution Trust--right--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that ultimately is what this TARP [Troubled Asset Relief Program] thing was supposed to have been.  Very much it reminds me of this time.  It's--just now it's worse.
Story_ID: 228657
Speaker 1: Did you, with Dime [Savings Banks of New York; Dime Bancorp Inc., New York, New York], what would you say were your sort of takeaways from that experience, though?
Speaker 2: Okay I'll blend that with your earlier question about, about what were the surprises.  I learned that there's a difference between being a judge and an executive.  So my training had been as the law and to, you know, listen to all sides and then try and find the truth in the midst of this, these conflicting views.  But you don't have time to do that as an executive, number one.  You'll have everybody coming in and tell you everything, get all the evidence marshaled into me.  And then number two, the object isn't to sort of see who made the best argument or sort of divine truth out of this clashing of, of views.  It is to have a point of view, hopefully informed, and then make a judgment as to what's the right thing to do as opposed to where the truth may lie, right.  So learning how to be an executive as opposed to an arbiter of facts was a key transition for me in the Dime experience.  Number two, I learned that I'm, I'm a friendly bear.  I--one of the reasons I was the managing partner at the law firm [Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler, New York, New York], I was a friend to everybody, right.  Everybody was my friend and I was everybody's friend.  And you treat friends a certain way and they appreciate that, so on and so forth.  You can't do that when you're running a, a corporate entity.  You can't really even do that when you're running a big firm, but, but, but a corporate entity, I, I, I made a mistake.  I became friendly with a number of the people that ultimately I had to let go when we got into the thrift crisis [savings and loan crisis] swap, right.  Or it's one thing to have to let somebody go because, because of performance issues.  That's not easy.  But at least you can in your own mind rationalize it.  But when you have to let people go--that was the hardest thing for me.  When, you know, "blameless" just we couldn't afford you know--the plane was going to go down unless you threw some people out of the plane.  That was hard.  And it was particularly hard if, if you created--you know if there was no, no barrier between you and them emotionally and so on and so forth.  So I was--that was another take away that, that sitting in judgment on people, which is what you have to do in these jobs, is not easily done with friends.  Nobody wants to sit in judgment on their friend, right?  I learned something about leadership, which is that you know most people don't want to be at the front of the parade, particularly if it's storming outside.  And they'd just as soon follow somebody else so it's not their, it's not on their head.  And if, if, if that is the cut of your jib, if that--if you're prepared to do that, that, that's more key than almost anything else.  You have to have some judgment, right?  But you also have to be able to lead people if you're in a position of leadership, which has more to do with just being prepared to accept responsibility.
Story_ID: 228658
Speaker 1: So when you came to Time Warner [Inc., New York, New York], and are you saying that you used all that you knew at Dime Savings [Bank of New York; Dime Bancorp Inc., New York, New York] for here and did that really prepare you for all the things that you were going to face here?
Speaker 2: No it didn't.  But it was some, it was some preparation.  You can't really run anything if you don't know the business, right?  That's, again that's sort of like a given.  You have to at least know what the bus--how the business is supposed to look like when it's run right and profitably.  Which means you understand how the pieces fit together and how they work together.  So I had to learn this business when I came here.  I couldn't learn this business from outside any more than I could really learn the Dime business from outside.  You have to get into the trenches and get your hands all in the stuff and learn it.  But I'd say the basic leadership skills or package was much improved and much refined by the Dime experience.
Speaker 1: Now what was the most difficult part of, of your tenure here?  Was it--I mean maybe you might even answer that in a sequence of, of--
Speaker 2: Well there were only two times (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) As a personal--
Speaker 2: That were really difficult.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The most difficult was right after the AOL [Inc.; America Online, New York, New York] merger.  Managing all the personalities, it was, it was, it was apparent almost from the time--from shortly after the, the deal was announced that this--the foundations on which the whole deal was premised were crumbling under us and the, and the structure was sliding down the side of a hill.  And that's, you know that's not a great time to be anywhere.  And it's particularly not a great time when you have all these people up at the top who aren't necessarily seeing things the same way, or don't have the same agenda and so it was a lot of managing of personalities, of, of different cultures because the AOL culture was different than Time Warner culture.  In an environment where as I say, the, the, the foundations of the structure are, are being obliterated.  And then when I became CEO, it was shortly after that the AOL accounting irregularities came to light.  And so we had the governments in the form of the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] and the justice department [U.S. Department of Justice], shareholders, all the media, everybody just trying to, you know, kick the house which was already sliding down the hill, over.  So that was a tough time.
Speaker 1: Now you didn't, you didn't talk in the interview ['An Evening With Richard Parsons'] about Carl Icahn and his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah that wasn't really tough.
Speaker 1: It wasn't tough, okay.
Speaker 2: That was, you know the reality of that situation was I knew from day one this guy could not win.  From day one.  So it was just a matter of managing him and managing the media.  Now Carl is gifted with the media.  So he created, he created an impression of--two minutes--he created an impression of you know really close contests and all this stuff.  But he, he was never in the game.  So it was, it was how to manage him and how to manage him to a place that--cause he, even though he could not win, he was capable of creating enormous mischief, right, so you don't want that.  So how to get Carl to a place where we could, you know, part company.  He could go pursue whatever else he wanted to without having, you know, sort of shot up lots of little holes in my canoe that would now need to be patched.  Even though he never could sink the canoe.  So that wasn't that hard.  That was, that was almost fun.  The other time that was hard, the, the--managing the transition at AOL was tough.  And, and it's just cause you know, like people always say well who were your biggest competitors?  Well everybody who, who's in the media space is our competitor, even [The] HistoryMakers to some extent.  But there's nobody--this is a big boat, right.  This is a big boat.  It's the biggest one on, in our space.  There's nobody out there that was going to sink our boat, [Rupert] Murdoch, Sumner Redstone, you know--the only, the only entity that's really big enough to take us out was the government.  And there was a point in time where they were on that warpath, so that was hard.
Speaker 1: You're talking about during the, the whole merger.
Speaker 2: I'm talking about right after the merger and with all the accounting irregularities.  The other time that was tough for me was the first two years I was here, the transition from being--from running your own shop where I was, you know chairman, CEO of the Dime.  Even though I came here to be president, not being in control of your own life and your own agenda as I had gotten used to was--it took some adjustment.
Story_ID: 228659
Speaker 1: What would you do differently had you to do it over again during this whole last, you know period with Time Warner [Inc., New York, New York].  If you had done anything differently, would you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would all be things in the margin.  I just move faster.  You know I still have an instinct too that, that undermine my effectiveness as an executive.  One is to be right, you know and, and you can, you can spend too much time sort of getting facts and doing analysis and listening to arguments as I said, almost--
Speaker 1: That's the legal side.
Speaker 2: Like a judge again.  And then two is I hate to, to disappoint people and to hurt people.  So you try and find ways of getting done what you need to get done in a way that whoever it is you're doing it to or with, can buy into it and can accept it and can understand it and sometimes you just got to go.  Just got to do the right thing and acknowledge that not everybody's going to be happy and not everybody's going to agree and not everybody's going to think that this is what ought to have happened.  But if it's your call, you got to make the call and move on.  So I'd be, I would be more urgent about some of the things I have done, or did, or should have done, and less process-oriented.  But only slightly less.

Speaker 1: And just one last question and that is there some--is there one thing that you can look at and I'm--this is about the AOL [Inc.; America Online, New York, New York]/Time Warner [Inc., New York, New York], that you think was a mistake on your part?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now I don't think it was material to the deal.  What, you know, if any of us could have seen into the future and could have seen the way in which the dot com world was changing and that the core product of AOL was basically becoming commoditized, and therefore value was going to be sucked away from this thing, we wouldn't have done the deal.  But nobody saw that, nobody.  The thing I was wrong about was I thought, well you know we could--there were very different cultures.  One of the reasons for doing the deal was they were different cultures and we wanted to blend some of that you know insurgency, into the staid Time Warner culture.  Well I underestimated the enormity of that task.  I, if you would ask me today, I, I would put it in the category of impossible.  You could not blend those two cultures.  But I could be wrong.  Somebody with more skills and more time may be able to--and different circumstances, might have been able to do it.  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't do it.  It was, they were just too different.
Speaker 1: But what would have happened had you not done that?  I mean if you go-- look now--
Speaker 2: Had we not done the merger?
Speaker 1: Yeah because I mean look, they're--I mean first you had the merger with Ted Turner, which was a personality thing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but that was hugely successful, hugely successful.  As a business matter.  If we hadn't, if we hadn't merged with AOL--
Speaker 1: If you had stopped right there.
Speaker 2: If we hadn't merged with AOL, we would still be the largest media entertainment company in the world is my guess.  We wouldn't be as big as we are now, but, but I'm not sure I'd be CEO because I'm not sure Jerry [Gerald] Levin would ever have left.  He was having a lot of fun.  But who knows, you know, 'cause who knows where AOL would have gone and what other dominoes that would have--
Speaker 1: Created in the marketplace (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Created.

Story_ID: 228663
Speaker 1: It is an honor to have an opportunity to sit down and do this interview with you because you've had a tremendous career.  We all know you, of course, as the giant behind Time Warner [Inc.].  And you're my boss too (audience laughter).  So on all those fronts, makes it fun for me to talk to you tonight.  But I would like to start this conversation from the very beginning.  So let's go back to 1948.  Tell me about your mom [Isabelle Judd Parsons] and dad [Lorenzo Parsons].
Speaker 2: My mom and dad.  My dad was from Virginia.  He was the oldest of eight children and had grown up in Newport News, Virginia, went to Hampton University [Hampton, Virginia], which was Hampton College [sic. Hampton Institute] in those days, and then came north, looking forward.  My mother was born in Tarrytown, New York.  She was the last of six children.  She really grew up in Brooklyn [New York, New York].  And so, they met in New York, married and they had five children, and I'm the second of the five.
Speaker 1: You grew up in Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York, New York].  So what do you remember about Bed-Stuy?
Speaker 2: Actually a lot, a lot because I was, you know--small boys and baseball, right?  There's just something, I don't know, there's something in the chemistry.  I was a huge Dodger [Brooklyn Dodgers; Los Angeles Dodgers] fan.  We lived on Pacific [Street] in Bedford [Bedford-Stuyvesant].  And Ebbets Field [New York, New York] was like six or eight blocks up Bedford Avenue.  And my father used to take me to games, and I had an Aunt Lou [ph.] who was infirmed.  And so she couldn't get out of the house much.  She was in a wheelchair.  And she listened to every Dodger game religiously.  And I became a huge Dodger fan.  And I remember, and I remember going up to Ebbets Field.  And I remember the lock.  We lived on a block where, you know, life unfolded in just this one block.  You had, you had good guys, bad guys, characters, hustlers, ministers.  We had a hospital.  We had an armory.  We had everything on our block.  So you didn't have to go off the block to find out about the world (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Was your family well off, working class, what?
Speaker 2: Well, we, you know, we always considered ourselves working class.  Now, the dirty little secret was that everybody was poor.  But, so what we really were, you know, statistically or if you, if you talk to the economists, we were part of the working poor.  But we're working, right.  They had money coming in, and, and they had to watch it carefully.  And until when we moved--my oldest sister [Loretta Parsons Poole] was born in, in Harlem [New York, New York].  And I was born in Brooklyn.  My parents lived in, you know, sort of rental units.  And then in the mid-'50s [1950s], my father bought a house out in Queens [New York, New York] for the princely sum, I think of $11,900.  And we moved to the Promised Land, which was South Jamaica [Queens, New York, New York] (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And what was that like?
Speaker 2: Oooh.
Speaker 1: Going from Bed-Stuy to South Jamaica?
Speaker 2: Well, it was, it was--first of all, we thought of it as the country (audience laughter).  It's like unbelievable.  I mean there wasn't, there wasn't a store on the corner like there--you know in Brooklyn, you could go--as I said, everything was on the block including stores 'cause Queens back in the early '50s [1950s], maybe mid to early '50s [1950s] was still very rural and was still being developed.  It was like a boys' paradise 'cause you could--you know, there were swamps, stuff like that (audience laughter).
Story_ID: 228664
Speaker 1: You've said that your father [Lorenzo Parsons] is the one who instilled the idea of working hard.  Tell me how he did that.
Speaker 2: Because that's how you got anything from him.  I'm not talking about love and affection.  I'm talking about material things.  I remember--what still sticks with me, I wanted a telescope.  I got into astronomy when I was, I'm gonna say eight, nine years old.  And I needed a telescope.  So I asked my father if he'd get me a telescope.  And he said, "I'll tell you what.  I'll go halvsies with you."  That was his answer to everything.  I'll go--I'm good for half, and you put up half.  And I said, "Well, how am I gonna get my half?"  And he said, "You can work for it."  So he gave me a job.  He, he was constantly fixing up the house, doing things.  And he decided he wanted to, to pave the little driveway from the street to where he'd built his carport with these Belgian blocks that all the streets in New York [New York] used to be made of.  And then eventually somebody invented macadam.  And so they tore up all the building blocks and put macadam down.  And there was a place about two blocks from my house where they were tearing up the street.  And these things were, I mean like giant loaves of bread that weighed thirty pounds.  And he said, "I'll tell you--I'll give you a nickel for every two you bring up to the house," (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: I had this wagon and I would, you know, I was schlepping these Belgium [sic.] blocks.  But, you know what?  It worked.  I mean I, I eventually got my half.  And he was good for his half.  And I figured it out, as I'm sure he wanted me to figure out, that if you would invest yourself in something and work towards it, you can achieve almost anything--
Story_ID: 228665
Speaker 1: Tell me about school.  Eight years old.
Speaker 2: School was a, sort of a mixed bag for me.  I went from being an indifferent student--I was never a bad student.  But there were periods, whole periods of time when I was somewhat indifferent to the school experience, and then periods of time when school was engaging to me.  And I, I would apply myself and do reasonably well.
Speaker 1: You went to P.S. 45 [Queens, New York, New York]--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --and [Edgar D.] Shimer Junior High School [Queens, New York, New York].  And you graduated early?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So how did--explain that where the student is "eh" indifferent?
Speaker 2: Well, I said there were periods when I wasn't indifferent (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So I got, effectively, skipped twice, but that's, those were in the good years (audience laughter).  You know, if I had to do it all over again, and I did this with my son [Gregory Allen Parsons], I would not, I would not have skipped a couple of grades.
Speaker 1: And what else do you--are there other things you regret from that time?  I mean looking back, I mean do you regret being an indifferent student?
Speaker 2: Well, you almost have to.  You almost have to.  There comes a point in most people's lives, I think, when they realize how engaging learning can be and how empowering knowledge is, and how satisfying it is to learn something.  And you go like, boy, you know, I don't have any time for that now.  I wish--I should have done this when I was in college.  So there is some regret, but it's mostly abstract.  I don't have, I don't lay awake at nights regretting it.
Story_ID: 228666
Speaker 1: You had a couple of choices for college.  What were you looking at?
Speaker 2: I wanted to go to Princeton [University, Princeton, New Jersey] because when I was in the seventh grade, our school took a trip to Princeton.  And I just fell in love with the ivy halls and the campus and the whole, you know, it's the classic northeastern college.  And so that was my first choice.  My mother [Isabelle Judd Parsons] insisted that I apply to CCNY, City College [of New York], New York [New York], because we had no money.  And she said, you can't go to Princeton.  And this was before they would just give you money if you could get in.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: And then I--my third choice was University of Hawaii [at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii].
Speaker 1: Why the University of Hawaii?
Speaker 2: Because when I was in high school, I sat next to this girl from Hawaii (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Really, literally?
Speaker 2: She rocked (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: Was she attending University of Hawaii (laughter) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I, you know, this is--no, she was from Hawaii.  This is the truth.  I actually didn't know that there was a University of Hawaii when I put it down.  You know, you used to be able to put three schools down on your SAT's, and so I put Princeton, CCNY and I thought, well, Hawaii.  And I got waitlisted at Princeton, and no money.  And I was not gonna go to CCNY.  I wanted to leave.  So I went to the University of Hawaii.
Speaker 1: Was the--since the girl wasn't there--
Speaker 2: Thoughtful, right?
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, but there were others, I mean (audience laughter) that was the whole theory of the case.
Speaker 1: So you had--(laughter), you had, you--so, when you get to the University of Hawaii, it's everything you thought it was gonna be?
Speaker 2: It (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) That's gotta be a little bit, a sharp transition for a guy from New York.
Speaker 2: It really was.  It took, it took me the better part of my first year.  You go out to school, and, and even then, you know, college-level athletics is consuming.  I mean you're playing six, seven hours a day.  So you're all consumed in basketball.  And then, but when it ends, and you have to make the adjustment to the place, it was very different than New York.  So it took me about a year to sort of find my place.  But I did and I would say--my wife [Laura Bush Parsons] always gets mad at me when I say this, although she was a part of it.  The last three years I spent in Hawaii were the best years of my life.
Speaker 1: Really.  Why?
Speaker 2: I just had fun (audience laughter). I--you know, that's the one time in your life you're not living at home, right?  And you're not, you don't have a job (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And you're just hanging out and having fun--
Story_ID: 228667
Speaker 1: You met your wife [Laura Bush Parsons] there [University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii].  How did you meet?
Speaker 2: We met in school.  We met in class.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  (Audience laughter). Is this gonna be a hostile interview (laughter)?
Speaker 2: We met in class.
Speaker 1: You met in class.  What class?
Speaker 2: Well, it was a, it was an English class and in my sophomore year.  And, you know, I--it happened that I hadn't read the stuff, right?
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: So you're looking around for help (audience laughter).  And she was one of these, you know, that writes like, this so you can't see anything (audience laughter).  But finally I think I, you know, maybe I started crying or something.  But she finally let me see her paper.  And I thought, this is a relationship that we ought to develop (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: When did you know you were in love?
Speaker 2: After we broke up (audience laughter).  And, we dated pretty much our sophomore year.  And then we both went back, during our sophomore year, to the mainland.  I went to New York [New York], and she went to--she's from Oklahoma.  And then we came back, and we sort of didn't, didn't hook it back up, right, in the junior year.  And then she started dating some of my fraternity brothers (audience laughter).  That wasn't good.  And, and we sort of came back together, and then our senior year we were together pretty much all the time.
Speaker 1: When did you get married?
Speaker 2: Right after we got out of school, that summer, summer of 1968.
Speaker 1: So you met in 1965?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It wasn't a time when interracial dating and certainly even years later, interracial marriage, was accepted, embraced, et cetera.  Was that a big deal for you that, your girlfriend was white, that your wife-to-be was white?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't really a big deal for me, for a couple of reasons.  I'm over in Hawaii, right?  Everybody dates, you know, (audience laughter) interracially in Hawaii because it is a polyglot society, right?  And two, it just wasn't, you know, I--we thought about when we were gonna come back to the mainland.  And our parents, obviously, were concerned about it.  They reminded us--I remember my parents [Lorenzo Parsons and Isabelle Judd Parsons] saying, "This is not gonna be so easy.  And, you know, people are gonna do this, that and the other thing."  But it's been my experience, my personal experience that, that, you know, you can set yourself up for certain kinds of reactions and behavior.  And if you sort of go into something with a sense of confidence and certitude, you can, you can set the agenda frequently.  So it never really actually turned out to be a program.  And also, she's a sweet gal.  Everybody likes her.
Speaker 1: You give her a lot of credit for your success.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I do.  As I told you, from--literally from high school through college I was--it may be even kind to say I was an indifferent student.  I was more focused on things outside of the school environment, you know, just exploring the world and finding out what was outside of, of school.  And it was because, in part--I mean I could always rally at the end of the day, you know, get--do just enough to get by.  And that was fine for me, you know, getting by was fine as far as I was concerned 'cause I didn't have--I'll put it this way.  I didn't have misgivings about, you know, sort of the ability to hit the car, it'll go faster if you needed to.  But I didn't have anybody to do that for.  I didn't have to do it for myself, and there was nobody else.  Laura--that's my wife's name, Laura became the person in my life who it mattered to me what she thought of me.
Speaker 1: And that made you--
Speaker 2: Well, then you have to perform (audience laughter).  You can't be a goof-off.  You don't want somebody who's important to you and who you care what they think about you to think you're a jerk, even if you are (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Story_ID: 228668
Speaker 1: She's [Parson's wife, Laura Bush Parsons] the one who said you should be a lawyer.
Speaker 2: Well, she--it was her suggestion because I was casting about for what to do.  Originally, I thought--when I went to school [at University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, Hawaii], I thought I wanted to be a fighter pilot.  But this was Vietnam [War], right?  And you would see all these pictures of people being napalmed and what not, and that just seemed like not the thing to do (audience laughter).  So, you know, I was, like the rest of my colleagues.  We were all talking about what are you gonna do when you graduate?  And she said, "You ought to think about being a lawyer 'cause you love to argue.  Yeah, you would argue with a post," (audience laughter).  And I thought, well, that's interesting.  And then I had a drink with a friend of mine one night, a guy named Dan Kelly [ph.], who I never actually got to thank.  He said, "What are you gonna do?"  And I said, "Well, I don't know.  Laura seems to think I should, I should go to law school."  He said, "Well, yeah, there're always good jobs for good lawyers."  And that was it.  It just seemed to me, that was, that was enough of a threshold, you know.  Do something where you can get a job.
Speaker 1: You didn't finish school.
Speaker 2: I didn't finish college.
Speaker 1: How did you go from not finishing college to getting into law school [Albany Law School, Albany, New York]?
Speaker 2: Well, you--back in the day, I was, it turns out, I was six credits short because, you know, when you would take a course and things weren't going so well, which happened--not infrequently.  You would just take an "I," (audience laughter) incomplete.  So at the end of four years, by virtue of the accumulated "I's," they said, you need six credits to graduate.  And I was gonna do it during summer school.  And I had tested and gotten into law school and there's something in New York, at least then, called, New York law qualifying certificate or something like that.  Yeah, there were so many credits and such on the test, and they said, "Oh, well you can come here even if you don't."  And so, I bagged it.
Story_ID: 228669
Speaker 1: The year we're looking at now is 1968.  Want everyone to take a look.
Speaker 2: (Film clip - music).
ANNOUNCER:  In 1968, the United States was in turmoil.  Riots broke out in major cities across America.  Protests were held on college campuses.  The country elected [President] Richard Milhous Nixon and both [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King, Jr. and [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy were killed by an assassin's bullet.  There were protests against the [Vietnam] War and a mounting peace movement.  That same year, [HistoryMaker] Richard Parsons and his bride, Laura [Bush Parsons], headed to New York where he attended the University of Albany, Law School [sic. Albany Law School, Albany New York].  Here Parsons graduated in 1971, number one in his class.  He scored the highest statewide on the bar exam.  This caught the attention of Governor Nelson Rockefeller's office, and Parsons was hired onto Rockefeller's staff.  In the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, Nelson Rockefeller was picked by President Gerald [Rudolph] Ford [Jr.] to serve as vice president.  Nelson encouraged a group that included Parsons to follow him to [Washington] D.C. where Parsons served as general counsel and associate director of the Domestic Council, focusing on drug issues.  Then in 1976, Nelson Rockefeller was dropped from the ticket, and Parsons and his family returned to New York.
Story_ID: 228670
Speaker 1: What was that time like?  Chaotic?
Speaker 2: Seventy--well, from graduation from [Albany] Law School [Albany, New York] to '76 [1976]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't--that wasn't particularly chaotic.  I worked for four years for Nelson [Rockefeller] in [New York] state government before we went to Washington [D.C.].  Washington was pretty chaotic because it was just on the hills of Watergate [Scandal], and, and that was obviously a time of great national trauma.  And so moving all the [President Richard Milhous] Nixon folks out and putting a new team on the field was the order of the day.  And I really, to this day, think [President] Gerald [Rudolph] Ford [Jr.] never got quite enough credit for being the right guy at the right time in terms of just settling things down and restoring credibility to the office of the president.
Story_ID: 228671
Speaker 1: When you moved back to New York, Laura [Bush Parsons], by now was your wife?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You got married, and you settled on the Rockefeller estate [Kykuit, Sleepy Hollow, New York].
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, we lived there for eight months or so.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather, and you tell a story about him, Old Man Judd.
Speaker 2: William--well, his name was William Judd.  He was referred to as Old Man Judd.  Yeah, we, we--when we left Washington [D.C.], I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do next.  I knew I wanted to practice law in the government.  He [Nelson Rockefeller] said, "Well, look, why don't you come back to New York and work with me for a while, and you can have a place on the estate and, you know, sort it out.  Take a year, whatever."  So that's what we did.  And when we got there--and he, Nelson had known some gardener, and I don't remember his name, came up to me, and said, "You know, I knew your grandfather, Old Man Judd."  Now, I had, I really didn't know my grandfather.  My grandfather died when I was three, my grandfather on my mother's [Isabelle Judd Parsons] side.  She was a Judd.  But I knew the story that, you know, I told you.  She was born in Tarrytown [New York], and he had been on the estate--apparently, he had become at one point in time, a head gardener.  And he had, but trained a lot of other people in, before he retired and then ultimately died.  And so this guy knew my grandfather.  And he said, "He was a great ole guy and taught me everything I know about working in the garden, and so on and so forth."  And he disappeared and a couple of days later, he came back and said, "You know, I, I saw my sister," who had been a cook--these were Polish immigrants who had come during the [Great] Depression.  And she was a cook in the kitchen.  This guy said, "I saw my sister, and I said, 'Margaret, guess what?  You'll never guess what.  Ole Man Judd's grandson has just moved back on the estate.'  And she said, 'That's nice.  Is he working in the gardens?'"
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: You know, the wheel turns.
Story_ID: 228672
Speaker 1: Was politics something that was incredibly interesting to you in a personal way, something you'd wanna do one day down the road?
Speaker 2: I thought it was, but ultimately concluded that it wasn't for me, at least at that point in time.  Well, because, even bad politicians work hard (audience laughter), even bad.  I mean Nelson [Rockefeller] had--at one point in time, we--he wanted me to run for attorney general.  There was a guy named Louis [J.] Lefkowitz who was the attorney general, and Louis was, had been attorney general for twenty-six years or something like that.  And he was gonna retire.  So he says, "Go up and talk to Louis and we'll figure this out."  And I went and talked to Louis, and he took out this book for the--his appointment book 'cause nobody had Blackberry's in those days.  And he showed me.  He said, "Pick a day."  So I picked a day, a year ahead.  And he went down, and he had seven events, seven events already scheduled for that day, a year ahead.  And I thought to myself, you know, I have a wife [Laura Bush Parsons], I have three small children.  I can't do that.  So I'll put it off.  And I'm still putting it off (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter)  Talk about the relationship you had with Nelson Rockefeller.  You talk a lot about him as a mentor--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --also, even beyond that personal relationship.
Speaker 2: He was my mentor.  He was my first, sort of professional mentor, and he was a terrific mentor in that, you know, if a mentor is somebody who's supposed to, almost like a pulling guard, run through the line and knock everybody down so you can just kind of zip through, he did that for me.  But we became kind of pals.  And I liked him, I liked him.  He liked me.  And he did a lot for me.  He basically, you know, to the extent that, that success in life is a combination of luck, what you know and who you know, Rockefeller opened a world to me of, of important relationships that a kid Bed-Stuy [Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York, New York] and South Jamaica [Queens, New York, New York] would never, ever have enjoyed.
Speaker 1: Relationships that you would later sort of come back to.
Speaker 2: Yeah, every--almost everything that I have done in my professional life since that time, I can sort of trace back to some kind of connection that came out of the Rockefeller.  But, again, through him, I, I got to work in the White House [Washington, D.C.] for a couple of years and when I was in state government--and some of these names were here before, but again, the guy who was superintendent of banks, is a guy named Harry [W.] Albright [Jr.], and, you know, the way governors' offices or presidents' offices worked, they have a group of interns staffing who intermediate between the center the departments.  So I had the banking department.  I got to know Harry reasonably well. I got to know a fellow named Judge [Harold] Tyler who was on the Waterfront Commission [of New York Harbor] 'cause Rockefeller had put him there.  I got to know the governor's family very well.  And it was quite a family.  I mean the--Win [Winthrop Rockefeller] was gone, but John [D. Rockefeller III] was the oldest brother, Nelson, Lawrence [Rockefeller] and David [Rockefeller].  And each of them in their own way have been helpful to me over the course of time.
Speaker 1: He wanted you to stay on and work for him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you wanted to go a different direction?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, you know, I wanted to, I wanted the law firm experience.  And ultimately, ultimately, he had this goal or objective or desire for me.  He thought I should be on the [U.S.] Supreme Court one day.  And so I said to him, I can't get to the Supreme Court from here.  You know, I gotta go and practice law and be part of the bar and the establishment.  And he said, got it.  And then it was okay.
Story_ID: 228673
Speaker 1: Got a little clip about the new experience you were heading to.  Let's take a look.
Speaker 2: (Film Clip - Music).
ANNOUNCER:  In 1977, [HistoryMaker Richard] Parsons was asked to join the law firm of Patterson, Belknap Webb & Tyler [New York, New York] by former deputy attorney general, Harold [R.] Tyler [Jr.].  Nelson Rockefeller objected initially, but then he became one of Parsons' clients.  In two short years, Parsons was named a partner with clients that included Estee Lauder and Happy Rockefeller.  Parsons would practice for ten years, building a stellar reputation and he was promoted to managing partner.  At this same time, one of his clients, Dime Bancorp [Inc.; Dime Savings Bank of New York, New York, New York]'s chairman and CEO, Harry Albright, asked Parsons to come aboard as its chief operating officer [CEO].  [President Ronald Wilson] Reagan was president and the United States underwent the worst S&L [Savings and Loan] crisis in U.S. history.  Parsons had never managed a bank, but in short order, he was successful in helping to reduce the bank's $1 billion debt to $335 million.  Two years later, at the age of forty-two, Parsons was rewarded by being promoted to chairman and CEO of Dime Savings Bank.  This promotion caught the attention of many in corporate America.

Speaker 1: Did you feel you were completely ready to take over a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: It didn't bother me, I--you see, you know, I was already battle tested that when I--it's a true story.  Obviously, this was in the works and negotiating for a while, but when I finally decide to do it, and I knew it was now going to become public, my wife [Laura Bush Parsons] insisted that I sort of tell the children who were then, I don't know, twelve, ten and nine, something like that.  And so I told 'em at dinner one night.  I said, "Well, you know, just so you guys know 'cause you're gonna hear something about this, I'm leaving my law firm.  And I'm, I'm gonna go become president of the Dime Bank [Dime Savings Bank of New York; Dime Bancorp Inc., New York, New York]."  My son [Gregory Allen Parsons], who, who is sort of a fairly robust guy, eats with both hands, just kept eating.  "Good luck," he said (audience laughter).  Both of my daughters dropped their silverware, literally, and the oldest one whipped around and looked at their mother and said, "Has he talked to you about this?"
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: And then she looked back at me, and she said, "What do you know about running a bank?"
Speaker 2: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: And then her--the youngest one said, "Yeah, you can't just start out as president.  You have to start out as like teller."
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: So, I was ready for it (audience laughter).
Speaker 2: So when other piled on it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, right, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Were you nervous about going?  I mean what did you know about running a bank?
Speaker 1: (Laughter) This is a hostile interview (audience laughter).  Something, I mean I--
Speaker 2: Were you worried?  I mean were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, I mean I knew a lot about the business because I had been representing the bank for half a dozen years.  And while I wasn't a banker, per se, I knew, I knew how the thing worked.  And then the other, the other issue is managing people, right?  And that's, I think--and Harry [Albright] was gonna still be there.  And his, his deal with me, is he said, "I'll teach you in the next two years."  He wanted to retire in two years.  He said, "I'll teach you everything you need to know about running a bank.  I just want somebody in here who I think is principled and who has some leadership capacities and who can take the bank forward in the future."
Story_ID: 228675
Speaker 1: Talk about your wife [Laura Bush Parsons] and your three children, I mean running a bank [Dime Savings Bank of New York; Dime Bancorp Inc., New York, New York] then becomes, even as many hours a lawyer has to work, kind of this, could be a next level of being busy.  And you turned down politics.  So a year later--you know, a year out in your calendar, you wouldn't be doing seven events.  Were you concerned about that?  I mean was that something that ever came to you in your career where you thought it's too much (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.  I wasn't concerned about going to the bank because, you know, the theory at the time about savings bankers was, you know, they had the, what they called the three-six-three rule.
Speaker 1: What's that?
Speaker 2: You took the money in at three percent.  You lent it out at six percent, and you're on the golf course by three o'clock (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: So, you know, I--in fact, several of my partners who were, who were--who didn't think this was the right move for me, said, yeah, you're gonna go, you're gonna make some money, but it's, it's, you know, it's for old guys, you know.  You're not an old guy.  You're just gonna sit back and clip coupons and it's a sinecure almost.  It turned out not to be that way.  But it was a thrift crisis.  But, but nobody in my view, at least in New York [New York], works as hard as trial lawyers do.  I mean it's a crazy business.  That's one of the reasons I left.
Speaker 1: Before we talk about the thrift crisis, did you have any thoughts about leaving a successful firm--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --where you had moved up quickly, and you were clearly a rainmaker?
Speaker 2: It was hard, it was hard because it's not just my partners.  I was managing partner of the firm.  I'd been running the firm for four years, and so you feel like you're gonna leave people in the lurch a little bit, and I liked my partners.  And, but it was, but it's also clients.  You know, lawyers develop a relationship with clients where they, they come to rely on you.  They come to look to you for certain kinds of things.  And if you like that sort of relationship, that's something that's hard to capture in business.
Speaker 1: So what ultimately made you make that decision?
Speaker 2: Probably my wife.
Speaker 1: And she thought it was right because?
Speaker 2: Well, we had this conversation, and she said--you know, Laura is the kind of person where she will tell you what you ought to be thinking.  So I said, "Well, I don't know.  What do you think?"  "Well, if I were you, I would do this, I would do that."  I said, "Well, you're not me.  I didn't ask you what you would do if you were me.  What do you think?"  And then she sat back, and she thought, and said, "Well, I'll say this.  You seem to have gotten a bit stale.  You're not--you don't relate to what you're doing now the way you used to.  And so you've gotten kind of stale in it.  And so that says to me, you're probably ready to do something else.  And I don't know if this is the right thing or not, but give it a shot."
Speaker 1: Did you feel ready for a new challenge?
Speaker 2: I felt it was--I thought she was right, you know.  I thought she was right.  I thought that, you know, there are two kinds of people in the world.  There are some who get, who just get better at and take more satisfaction out of something the longer they do it, and the better the become at it and the deeper they go into it.  And then there are those who, who after a fashion, you feel like you've been around this track once.  And while it's not identical every other time around the track, it's vaguely familiar and less exciting and less rewarding.  And I'm the latter type.
Story_ID: 228676
Speaker 1: How challenging was it to become the director of --have an operations position essentially at a time when you have this massive thrift crisis?
Speaker 2: Well, it turned out to be--it was more challenging than I thought.  I mean every time I made a move, it, it never works out the way you think it's gonna work out.  It never does.  It always works out--there's always some twist or turn that is different.  And in the case of the bank [Dime Savings Bank of New York; Dime Bancorp Inc., New York, New York], it wasn't so much a learning the, the business as it was learning how to manage other people.  I'd say, I'd point out two things.  One, being sort of the friendly bear type, right, I went in and made a lot of friends at the bank and so on and so forth.  And then you're in the middle of a crisis and you have to start making personnel judgments that are harsh.  It's very hard to sit in judgment on a friend, right.  In fact, with respect to your friends, you're supposed to forgive them their trespasses, right, because they're your friend.  As a boss, you can't do that.  My job was really to sort of keep the troops jollied up and moving forward and keep the regulators from closing in on the bank while we worked out our problems, which meant that we had--they had to, they had to have confidence that we were both on the right track and that we wouldn't embarrass them at the end of the day.
Speaker 1: How do you keep troops jollied up when you have got to fire people, and a lot of people (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It's not easy.  It's not easy, it's not easy, although, you know, I think there's no substitute for communications.  We fired--we went from 4,400 people to less than 2,000 (audience buzz), right.  And I didn't catch a suit.  I fired 'em all.  Well, half of that was attrition and firing is a tough word.  We don't like that word.  We, we downsized, right-sized, (audience laughter), restructured.  But if you go and talk to people--
Speaker 1: They got fired.
Speaker 2: Well, that's harsh.
Speaker 1: They feel they got fired (laughter).
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: But how do you--I mean it's very hard.  It (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It is--
Speaker 1: --it's hard to keep the morale of the company which is what's really critical at a time when you also have to do the tough call--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --of letting certain people go?
Speaker 2: It is, it is.  It's hard.  But I think if people understand the circumstances, it certainly goes a long way towards--with respect to those who have to go, and, you know, we, we tried to be helpful to everybody who had to go.  And with respect to those who stay, they understand why and, and why it's necessary and what the future could look like if this plan works.
Speaker 1: Explain to us what you achieved in the turnaround, what did you go from and most dire and where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --did it end up?
Speaker 2: It sound melodramatic.  But we saved the bank 'cause the bank was marked for extinction.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: They have various rankings under the federal regulatory system, one through five.  And one's are the strongest, and five are the ones that have to be taken out.  We were, we had--at one point got ranked a five.  And so everybody knew we were gone.  And yet the thing turned around, and, you know, banks are important entities in this economy.  Banks are the, next to the heartbeat of the nation.  You can't have a modern economy without an effective banking system.  So saving the bank meant, meant not only saving the jobs of the people who worked there, but, but an institution that helps fund people's dreams, helps them buy houses, helps them send their kids to college, helps them fund their lives.  So it was a worthwhile thing to have done.
Story_ID: 228677
Speaker 1: You started working in politics again, 1991, and then '93 [1993], you worked with Rudy Giuliani on his campaign, lost in '91 [1991], but he won in '93 [1993].  And he was running against a black mayor, [HistoryMaker] David [N.] Dinkins.  Some people give you flack for not supporting the black mayor in that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Rudy and I--he lost in '89 [1989].  Rudy and I had been law partners for years.  And, in fact, I'd worked with him in Washington [D.C.].  And we had been very close when I practiced law.  In fact, we tried a lot of lawsuits together.  And I thought, you know, the city [New York, New York] was not in good shape.  And my favorite mayor has always been David Dinkins.  I love David as a personal friend.  But I thought that what Rudy could bring to the city was what the city needed.  The city needed to be civilized.  It was just out of control.  And you can't accomplish any of these other objectives if people don't wanna go out on the street or if they're, you know, if anybody who has the, the opportunity to leave, leaves.  And so I thought he was the better choice for New Yorkers at the time.
Speaker 1: Was that a difficult call to make to your personal friend, David Dinkins?
Speaker 2: It, it was.  But it wasn't, it wasn't as difficult as a lot of other things that I've had to do.
Speaker 1: At that point, did you feel, maybe politics again?  Why start working--I mean was it, we're working on his behalf because he was a friend, and you thought he'd be good or was it also maybe it's an opportunity to get back into politics?
Speaker 2: No, it was clearly the former.  I thought he would be the right guy, and I was happy to help out, but I didn't wanna go back into public life at that point in time.
Story_ID: 228678
Speaker 1: At that point in time, you joined Time Warner Sport, is that right, '91 [1991]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, '91 [1991].
Speaker 1: What was that like?
Speaker 2: Well, that was the, that was a hoot.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Why was it a hoot?
Speaker 2: Steve Ross [Stephen Jay Ross] was--and today, if you sort of type in "mogul," the picture of Steve Ross comes up.  Steve Ross was the last of the big Hollywood moguls.  And, and he was, he was an interesting guy.  And this was an interesting company.  Time [Inc.] and Warner [Communications] had just come together, and the, you know, sort of the blending the cultures and putting their businesses together.  And for me, at least being on the board of a company that operated on a global stage was, it was just--it was new and interesting.
Speaker 1: It was an acceptance to the board that would, in many ways, change your life, because it would lead to your next position.  Let's--first before I ask you a question out of it, let's roll a tape.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 228679
Speaker 1: (Film clip - Music).
ANNOUNCER:  In 1991, on the recommendation of Laurance Rockefeller, Dick [HistoryMaker Richard] Parsons was invited by Steven Ross [Stephen Jay Ross], Time Warner [Inc., New York, New York]'s CEO, to join Time Warner's board.  A year later, Steven Ross was dead, and Gerald Levin, former head of HBO was promoted to chairman and CEO.  Levin invested heavily in cable television and led the way for Time Warner's acquisition of Turner Broadcasting and its charismatic founder, Ted Turner.  Levin also recruited Parsons to serve as president of Time Warner.  Many doubted Parsons' qualifications fit for this position since he had no background in media.  By the year 2000, Levin engineered one of the largest mergers in the media industry when AOL [Inc.; America Online, New York, New York] merged with Time Warner.  This presented a clash of cultures and personalities, with Ted Turner, Gerald Levin, Steve Case and Bob Pittman working at odds with each other.  By 2001, Parsons was named Co-COO, along with Bob Pittman and by 2002, Pittman was out and Parsons was named Time Warner's CEO.  This surprised many, but it was Parsons that led Time Warner back to a more stable base.
Story_ID: 228680
Speaker 1: (Audience laughter) Brought in again at a time of crisis.
Speaker 2: I was gonna say, who did these things? (Audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) It's all true, it's all true.
Speaker 2: What's up with that?
Speaker 1: Once again, you're brought in to stabilize.  How did training as a lawyer, I mean clearly translated into not only being successful in business, but being the guy who could in and make everything stable?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think training as a lawyer only goes so far, but lawyers are trained, particularly, litigators, are trained to get on top of subject matter quickly because you have to, you have to know.  I mean I used to try all kinds of suits from medical malpractice suits, to business suits and, you know, I could pass--there was a point in time I could pass as an oncologist because I knew so much about oncology 'cause I'd have to examine, cross examine these guys.  So you learn, you learn the art of getting on top of the subject matter quickly.  And you're also oriented toward problem solving.
Speaker 1: What was that time like at Time Warner--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --when it seemed too chaotic, and if you read the newspapers, it was often bad news.
Speaker 2: Almost the entire fourteen years I was at Time Warner, were, were a roller coaster ride because after Steve Ross died, there was a lot of tumult around Gerry [Gerald Levin] becoming CEO and moving a lot of people out and moving me in.  Then we merged with Ted Turner's company.  Ted, who I regard as one of the, one of the most brilliant and accomplished businessmen in the last half of the 20th century, nevertheless, if you didn't have a crisis when Ted came in to visit you, Ted would create one, you know (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  None of them were small personalities.  What was it like to work with the Ted Turner sized personality?
Speaker 2: Ted, Ted is--he's just too much.  He's funny, he's funny.  And he's, he's intense, but he's very--like many entrepreneurs, he is convinced in his bones that his feel is the right feel.  So if you're more analytical, you know, sometimes you guys have difficulty coming to the same conclusions.  And then we did the merger with AOL [Inc., America Online, New York, New York], and that, that was, that was very tough because there were just two cultures that would not even--well, they just would not blend.  They would--there was no way to bring these two cultures together.
Story_ID: 228681
Speaker 1: When that merger [between America Online and Time Warner Inc.] happened, what were you thinking about it?  Did you think, this could work?  Did you think, this might not work?
Speaker 2: I thought it could work.  And as I've said before on occasion, I actually voted for the merger.  I was more circumspect about it.  I thought, and I remember saying to our board, this is going to change everything.  Everything's gonna be different from this point going forward.  But I thought it could work.  And several things happened.  One of their business models--this is the big thing that happened.  The business model under, laid the AOL [Inc.; America Online, New York, New York] business, got obsoleted by, by technological progress.  The thing that AOL did and charged for became free, email, right?  So you didn't have to pay to--$18.95 or whatever it was a month to have an email account.  You could now go into places and get it free.  And so AOL has been on a march since that time to try and, and develop a new business model and new revenue models.  But the other thing was the cultures just--they were, they were truly hostile to each other.
Speaker 1: How so?  Describe each side?
Speaker 2: And it's a shame that we couldn't make the cultures work.  But I certainly couldn't.  The, the new order felt that the old had to get out of the way completely, that, that, you know, these were quote "dead tree businesses."  And so the sooner we could just sort of take all the rest of Time Warner and sort of sweep it off the table, and replace it with the new order or use whatever was there and push it through, the vehicle and instrumentalities of AOL, the better.  And the old order which, what we had thought was that you can't just keep doing the same thing.  And so we'd bring in some new thinking and new direction.  And the old order was just resistant to change.  But, but they just came at the world from totally different places and different sides.  And there was no accommodating or, or bringing the two together.  The thing that--and this is true, not just of AOL, but a lot of the new media businesses, I mean they, they have thought about, well, what is cool?  What's cool?  What's really--and we've got this new technology and new people coming along, and what would be a cool thing if we could create something cool, people will come to it.  And the old order sort of thinks about things in the opposite way, what can we sell?  And then how do we built it?  And we thought if we could put these two together, you'd have the best of both, you know, what's cool and you can sell.  And it turned out, they just fought with each other.
Story_ID: 228682
Speaker 1: I mean at one point we saw a shot where everyone's in the chairs, and you all look like you're smiling.  But what was it really like behind the scenes when it just--
Speaker 2: It wasn't as bad as it's been written up in several books and magazines.  But when you have a bunch of people, each of whom is convinced that they and they alone are right, it makes it hard for collegial and cooperative consensus.  And, you know, Ted [Turner] and Steve [Steven Ross], who were two very, very successful and very strong entrepreneurs, each had a view of--and both of them, it was interesting to me to step back now.  Not many people make this comparison, but when Ted did his merger with Time Warner [Inc., New York, New York], his vision was that all of the other parts of Time Warner would line up and, and support Turner [Broadcasting System, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia] and be translated through the world--to the world through the Turner vehicles, so that Warner Bros. [Entertainment, Inc., Burbank, California] would take all their movies and push them through Turner channels and only Turner channels.  And Time Warner Cable would make its cable plant available to Turner channels so they could spread all.  And, of course, the other guys didn't think that way (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: When AOL--we did the merger with AOL [Inc.; America Online, New York, New York], I remember Steve coming into a meeting of the music group once--we had a big music company at the time.  And he said, "Well, you know, essentially, here's what we're gonna do.  We're gonna take all the music that you guys sort of create and the artists and what not, we'll just give it away free on AOL," (audience laughter).  And they didn't see it that way either (audience laughter).  And his theory was, I mean it wasn't as though he was crazy.  His theory was that it would make the AOL service stickier and more attractive so you'd keep your customers.  And you'd bring in more customers 'cause you had all this free music on AOL.  But to the guys who had spent their entire business lives, you know, sort of eking out a living, finding and developing artists and then creating and promoting and then selling the music to people who wanted it, that didn't seem like a sensible play and sensible way to go.  And, and the two sides never came together.  Ultimately, shortly after I became CEO, it became clear that, that one culture was going to have to prevail in order, in order to get the company settled down.  And so that was the culture that I came from, like the older Time Warner culture.  But I still thought that we could rehabilitate our way into and capture the magic of this new media business.  But I, I think it's just--they're so different that, that it's a very hard culture to meld.
Speaker 1: What do you think Time Warner would look like if, in fact, hadn't done the merger?  I mean were there things that were gained and things that were lost or just things that were lost?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think--certainly a lot was lost, a lot of money was lost.  And some people were lost, and good people.  I mean Bob Pittman was and still is a friend of mine, but, but, you know, it's like a--think of an organ transplant.  It was just tissue rejection, tissue rejection from all the AOL guys.  What was gained, however, was more of an appreciation for the fact that the old media has to begin to morph into new media so that we have now in every one of our divisions sort of--I'll call it divisionally indigenous efforts to extend the brands and the content into the new media space.  So, you know, and timing, you know, People.com, which is the online version of People.  Each of the divisions has, has understood better that we need to move in that direction, in the direction of taking old media content and re-platforming it, repositioning it, in the new media space.  But those have, have more or less had to be developed within the divisions so that it's compatible with the existing business models as opposed to completely dismissive or disruptive of it.
Story_ID: 228683
Speaker 1: Besides getting through the crisis and the chaos, what were your goals for when you started running Time Warner [Inc., New York, New York]?  I mean what did you wanna accomplish for the company?
Speaker 2: Well, the first thing was, you know, sort of get things settled down.  The company actually was, was never in as bad a shape as it was perceived to be.  The fact that the AOL [Inc.; America Online, New York, New York] business model had, had sort of collapsed or been obsoleted, and we lost so much value, caused everybody to think, "Ah, this company is a disaster."  All the other divisions were still running pretty well.  And all of the traditional Time Warner divisions were sort of "best-in-class."  We had the best movie studio.  We had the best magazine company.  We had the best cable networks.  We had the second largest, and I would say that technologically, the best cable distribution platforms.  And, and Warner Music Group [New York, New York] was probably not best-in-class, which was one of the reasons I sold it.  So we had very strong businesses, but in traditional media area.  And so highlight that, fix AOL, and then, and then transform these other businesses into both own media and online were the challenges.
Speaker 1: At Time Warner, you were always a very good mentor and sought out--I mean even the cafeteria, I thought, I noticed African American--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --young men and women who would say, "Dick [HistoryMaker Richard] Parsons is in the cafeteria.  I'm gonna go grab five minutes with him, if I can."  And you always made time for people, always.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I don't come from the same point in the compass.  It's a lot--for example, these, you know, young athletes who say well, I'm, you know, I'm not a role model, and, you know, I'm a basketball player.  I'm a whatever, and you shouldn't put that on me.  I just think, I think that's wrong.  I think that you are, in fact, by virtue of the fact that you exist and you're in a certain position, you are a role model for other members of your community, right?  And so I just think that comes with the territory.
Story_ID: 228684
Speaker 1: And back to your wife, Laura [Bush Parsons].  All the steps of the way, she was continuing to provide guidance for you, would you say?
Speaker 2: Yeah, actually, it's funny.  People always say to me, well, "Who do you go to for business advice?"  Because most of the people who know your business are competitors.  My wife has always been my best advisor.  She is--now, she does not like this term.  I think it's actually not so bad.  She's what I call the "smart dummy."  And by that I mean (audience laughter), she doesn't know, she doesn't know anything about my business, but she's a smart woman, right.  And she asks questions that somebody who really doesn't know asks.  And then when they get you, you know, you haven't thought the thing through, right.  She'll say, well, "I don't know why you're doing this."  And sometimes you have a good answer, and sometimes, you say, "Well, that's what we've always done."  And they say, but, "I don't know.  It doesn't seem to make sense to me."  And when you think about it, and if you can't come up with a better answer, then that's what we've always done, you have to go back and think about it again.  She's a smart woman.  So she, yes, she's, she--you know, basically, what is she gonna do, right, except be supportive?
Speaker 1: Tell me about your, the new love of your life, Jack?
Speaker 2: That's one of the reasons I wanna stay in New York [New York].  Jack's my grandson.
Speaker 1: That's one of the reasons you stay in New York?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, Jack, Jack's all right.  It's amazing.
Speaker 1: How much time do you spend with him?
Speaker 2: I mean, I don't know how many grandparents are out there.  But like, my wife said, "You didn't even like your own kids," (audience laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Do you see him every day?
Speaker 2: I don't see him every day, but we see him several times a week.  He stays over sometime.  If you came to my house, you would think we had a baby.  There's everything there.  My--
Speaker 1: And the way you talk about Jack, sometimes it sounds like you delivered that baby, though.  You love that child.
Speaker 2: I was there, I was there within fifteen minutes.
Speaker 1: How is he now?
Speaker 2: He's eighteen months old.
Speaker 1: He's a cute kid.
Speaker 2: Jack, yeah, Jack is, Jack's all right.  I introduce him to everybody.
Speaker 1: Does it surprise you that as a high-powered, CEO, you now think in terms of being around your grandson?
Speaker 2: No, it doesn't surprise me at all.  I mean I'm I'm almost ready to do the nanny thing (audience laughter).  We go to the park.  It is--actually, at some level it surprises everybody else.  And I can't, I can't explain it.  I really can't explain it.  I have a theory, but--
Speaker 1: Can we hear the theory?
Speaker 2: You know, guys are--I was on a safari once for my fiftieth birthday.  And we kept--we're in the Serengeti [Africa], and we would get in these jeeps and you roll around.  And every day, we found this pride of lions, and female lions were always doing something.  They're running around.  They're feeding the kids.  They're cleaning 'em up, they're hunting.  The guys were always sleep.  I mean like always (audience laughter).  And I was trying to get a picture of one of these guys.  So I said to the guide, "What do we do to wake these guys up?"  He said, "No, you don't understand."  He said, "They only wake up when the bad guys come, and they have to get--protect the pride."  And it, you know, it was like an epiphany.  I mean it's, we all have our roles.  And so, when my, when I had a young wife and then a young family, that was like the center of my world, right.  That was, that was my pride and I had to protect it.  Now, they don't need me, right.  You know, my wife is a very accomplished--it's not that they don't like me, but you know a very accomplished professional in her field.  And the kids are all, you know, gone and grown and married or whatever and doing their thing.  And I don't have, I didn't have a pride to relate to.  Now, I do (audience laughter) Little Jack.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) If you were given three lines for people to say, this is who he was, what's in those three lines?
Speaker 2: Good husband, good father, good grandfather (audience laughter).  I'll give a fourth line.  You know, my grandmother used to say that the essence of a good man was humility and grace.  I could go with that.
Speaker 1: Humility, grace in person, Dick [HistoryMaker Richard] Parsons.  Thanks for talking with us (applause).
