 Little Thunder My name is Julie Pearson-Little Thunder. Today is Friday, February 13,  2015. I   m interviewing Tom Mooney at the Tahlequah Public Library for the  Oklahoma Native Artist Project sponsored by the Oklahoma Oral History  Research Program at OSU. Tom, you just recently retired from your job at  the Cherokee National Museum. I   m looking forward to hearing more about  you, your long association with the Trail of Tears Art Show, which started in  1971, and quickly became one of the premiere shows in the state. The first,  probably annoying question I need to get out of the way is whether you are  any relation to ethnologist James Mooney who wrote about the Cherokee in  the late nineteenth century?  Mooney I   ve been asked that many times, and no, I   m not. I keep saying he was too  smart to be kin to me.  Little Thunder (Laughs) Where were you born and where did you grow up?  Mooney I was born in Tulsa. That was a special trip, though. I lived my entire  childhood in Mounds, Oklahoma, which is twenty-five miles south of Tulsa.  Went to school there and continued on to Oklahoma City University for my  bachelor   s, and the University of Tulsa for my master   s.  Little Thunder What did your folks do for a living?  Mooney My father, when I was born, he was working for a place called Tulsa  Training School, which he taught artwork there. He was a sign painter by  profession.  Little Thunder A sign painter?  Mooney Sign painter. He worked for Coca-Cola. Then, for Davis Aircraft. Then, then  out on his own. My mother primarily was in the newspaper business. She  worked about twenty years on newspaper advertising, and then became the  5  editor of the Society page or the Women   s page as they called it there at the  Sapulpa Harold.  Little Thunder The Sapulpa Harold?  Mooney Yes.  Little Thunder Okay. Are you Cherokee, and if so, what side of your family?  Mooney I guess I am one of those    wannabes    or    out-of-lucks.    They, on my  mother   s side, there is a story told of a lady who was of Cherokee  background from North Carolina. She was born really at the heart of the  Cherokee Nation in the 1700s. They went over the hill and were on the  wrong side to be enrolled. The family does make an application on the  Guion Miller Applications in 1906. And also on the Dawes Roll of 1896.  I talked to several other persons in the family who are genealogists. They   re  both convinced that they were more concerned about getting free land than  they were about being really proud of being Cherokee. My father   s side, his  mother, made application to the Dawes Commission, but they were living in  Arkansas. They were going to be Mississippi Choctaws. I think she was  something, too. The bloodline, I think, is out there. We can do this little  argument about who is, who isn   t. I   m just not quite as bully as some people  are about pressing the point.  Little Thunder You mentioned that your father had this sign painting background. What  was your exposure to art in your home growing up?  Mooney Actually, he wanted to be a cartoonist. At one point, he wanted to work for  Disney, but he couldn   t afford the trip out there.  Little Thunder Did he have an interview?  Mooney No, he just couldn   t get to California. That was his true love. He would sit in  church for example, doodling on church bulletins, drawing little cartoon  characters. The sign painting was what made the bread and butter around the  household. He was occasionally called upon do some artwork there. As far  as art in the household, it was not a lot of artwork. He didn   t paint. He did  one painting I know of. There wasn   t too much there.  Little Thunder He sort of thought of art as his     Mooney He loved artwork.  Little Thunder Possibly  influencing      6  Mooney When we would have out of town visitors, we would always throw them in  the car and take them up to the Gilcrease or Philbrook and Little Rock most  of the time. We made a lot of trips to those places.  Little Thunder What were your impressions? You were very young when you were going to  those museums, I guess.  Mooney I loved it up there. I always looked forward. For some reason, the Gilcrease  impressed me more than the Philbrook. I guess the European paintings  weren   t that fascinating to me.  Little Thunder You mentioned that you liked Gilcrease museum more than Philbrook. Why  was that?  Mooney I guess the European art wasn   t as fascinating to me. I did like the Indian Art  downstairs at Philbrook. Also, Mr. Gilcrease came from the Mounds area. I  thought that was   he was a hometown boy. There was a house out there that  we used to play in sometimes owned by the Gilcrease family. You   d drive  down this one road and there was this abandoned two-story house out there  with some of the Gilcrease family members still buried on the site there.  You had to park on the road, and cross a gate and go down this dark path,  which was   for a bunch of kids, it was made to scare you. You   d get up  there. We never did anything bad, but we did have parties out there. Other  people did, not me. They finally burned the house down at one point, at one  of the parties. He was Creek, so he got all his money that way in the oil  business.  Little Thunder Right. Were there specific Native artists that you were paying attention to,  or did you just know you liked Native artists?  Mooney At that point, I guess one of my biggest exposures was Acee Blue Eagle did  a set of tumblers for an oil company. They   d put these out and that   s  probably my first awareness of a Native artist, I guess. My mother had gone  to school with Cecil Dick and she talked about him sometimes. She said he  was always doodling in class and he   d throw pieces of paper on the floor  and stuff. She said she wishes she would have picked a bunch of those  papers up now and kept them because I guess they would have been quite  valuable at some point.  Little Thunder How about your exposure to art in elementary school and middle school?  Mooney Zero to none. It was a small school. There were no art classes to speak of. It  didn   t happen.  Little Thunder Where did you attend high school?  7  Mooney At Mounds.  Little Thunder At Mounds. Any exposure to art in high school?  Mooney No. My father, when he passed away, he did leave some money to the  school for a scholarship fund and to use in the art class. In his retirement, he  spent a few hours up there, teaching a voluntary class about artwork. He  enjoyed that part of it.  Little Thunder How neat. What happened after high school?  Mooney Well, you go to college. I went to OCU which is a good university. I wasn   t  quite sure what I wanted to do. Before that I   d had history. You can   t do a  whole lot with history other than coach basketball or something, and I  wasn   t a basketball player. I wasn   t a teacher. I went to one class downtown  in Oklahoma City, an education class that scared the devil out of me. I got  out there, and they were all mean-looking kids. This little small town school  boy, and I didn't like the urban school.  Little Thunder This is an education class that     Mooney It was a required education class.  Little Thunder     that scared you.  Mooney Scared me and got me out of the system.  Little Thunder Because of the students?  Mooney Oh, yeah. I didn   t want any part of that. So I went then to an internship class  at the Cowboy Hall of Fame. Went up there and did that. I worked for  different departments out there and got into   liked the museum business  very well.  Little Thunder So was it curatorial kind of internship?  Mooney The first semester we spent rotating through various departments. We spent  time with a curator, Juan Menchaca, and the Bust of Lincoln came in while  we were there. I saw them   they put it together with a fork lift because  you   ve got the legs, the torso, and the head. They chipped a piece out and  Menchaca was able to get through there. I knew where the break was, and he  fixed it to where you couldn   t see it.  Little Thunder I haven   t heard of him. Can you repeat his name?  Mooney Juan Menchaca. He came from Denver.  8  Little Thunder He did the bust for     Mooney The bust was by James Earle Fraser but the     Little Thunder Oh, okay.  Mooney The repair work on it when they moved it and set it up was somebody else.  End of the Trail was sitting out there on a flatbed trailer when I was there.  Little Thunder Wow.  Mooney That was an exciting time to be there.  Little Thunder When the monumental works arrived, you were there.  Mooney We were carrying some artwork through there one time. I just had this big  painting flopping around. It was a Thomas Moran, and Dean Krakel who  was the director at the time said,    It   s worth a quarter of a million dollars, so  be careful.    That was too much information. I didn   t need that.  Little Thunder (Laughs) So you got hooked on the museum business early?  Mooney I did. It was very nice to be out there. In the formative years of the Cowboy  Hall, too. They weren   t that old. It was 1968 when I was there. They were  still young, too.  Little Thunder Right. You were there for just a year as an intern?  Mooney Yeah, two semesters.  Little Thunder Two semesters. Was it easy for you to go to college? Did you have the  money or did you have to work?  Mooney My parents came through on that part of it for me. I was kind of weird. Had  a bowling scholarship, of all things. I was on the university bowling team.  Sounded like I was     Little Thunder So you did have that bowling scholarship.  Mooney It was through the youth bowling leagues. I think it was  250 or something  like that. It wasn   t a whole lot of money, but it was kind of neat to say I have  a bowling scholarship to go to college with.  Little Thunder Right. When you graduated from college your degree was in     9  Mooney History.  Little Thunder History. You had this taste for museum work. What did you do after that?  Mooney I applied to the University of Tulsa. Got in there. Got my master   s.  Little Thunder In history, also?  Mooney Applied to every museum I could think of, and didn   t get anything at all at  first. Worked at a paint store for about three or four years.  Little Thunder An art paint store or a regular paint store?  Mooney Just a regular paint store, Cook Paint and Varnish Company. Learned a lot  about business transactions there, I guess. How to keep books. The  opportunity to come to the Cherokee Heritage Center came up, so I went  there very willingly because I   m back in my hometown, basically. My  mother is from Tahlequah, and I   m very familiar with the town. I   m glad to  be here. I love it here. You can   t get me out of there hardly. I can   t imagine  being in one of these large towns where you have to fight traffic every day.  Little Thunder Right. So you are arriving in Tahlequah with your Master   s in History?  Mooney Yes.  Little Thunder What job title did you have?  Mooney My first title at the Heritage Center was historical researcher. Titles aren   t  going to mean a whole lot because the staff gets called upon to do a lot of  jobs that they aren   t fully trained for. It can be very unexpected. I came there  in December of    76. It was a very slow time, which I didn   t realize that the  museum was so seasonal. Probably three-fourths of their business comes in  the summertime. I   m in the basement of the museum   s library with the  archives, which was in one little file cabinet. It   s grown a lot since then. I  thought to myself,    Dear God in heaven, what have I done to myself? I   m  still single and I   ll never see anybody down here.     It   s been the most fascinating place to work at, though, to meet people. I was  very early put into the genealogy area, which gets a lot of traffic that way.  Then, just  inaudible  come through there. There   s people that drop through  that went to see Ernie Ford at the drama one night. Dr. Ruth, the sex doctor  came through for the women   s conferences they were having. We   ve had  more recently Justice Sandra Day O   Connor visiting. I met my wife there,  too, so     Little Thunder Tell us about that. Tell us about that encounter.  10  Mooney I met here there and later began dating her, so it was not a lot to tell there.  All   s worked out pretty good. I enjoyed my time there. I was there thirty-eight  years. In that length of time, a lot of stuff happens. Some good, some  bad. But that was one of the better things that happened to me.  Little Thunder Right. So the archives were originally, as you said, just in this one filing  cabinet?  Mooney It was one file cabinet. We had about six boxes of photographs in there and  some letters, just odds and ends. It really wasn   t that big. Later we acquired  the papers from Chief Keeler. Whenever Boyd Pierce passed away, got his  collection. Some other fairly sizable ones. There   s some there by Philip  Viles who is Supreme Court Justice. It   s been fascinating to see these things  come in as they     Little Thunder Right.  Mooney    arrive.  Little Thunder The Trail of Tears Show itself was only four years old when you arrived  there? I think started in    71?  Mooney I think it was sixth annual.  Little Thunder Oh, sixth annual. Okay.  Mooney It started in    72. First it was out in the Ancient Village. They tied it to the  trees and things.  Little Thunder The artwork was     Mooney Yeah, it was hung on trees.  Little Thunder     was hung from trees.  Mooney Right.  Little Thunder Okay. That was before     Mooney Then, they built the museum in    74.  Little Thunder Okay.  11  Mooney We got to have the shows in there. My first year was, of course, spring of     77 on the Trail of Tears Art Show. I didn   t know what the thing was. It  really wasn   t that impressive of a show.  Little Thunder What was the focus of the show then?  Mooney Every piece of artwork had to be a Trail of Tears theme.  Little Thunder Oh, okay.  Mooney They had two categories, contemporary and traditional. The traditional was  the flat style with no shading or anything. Very few people entered that part  of the show. It was mostly the contemporary that they entered. In 1979, as I  remember, they had nine artists entering fourteen pieces.  Little Thunder Wow. Were any of those artists    names that we would recognize?  Mooney If I could remember or not, they would be. The show was open to all artists.  That   s how we came to the decision about whether or not to continue the  show or what to do with it. It was basically in trouble, we knew that. At  about the same time, Philbrook was dropping their show.  Little Thunder The Indian Annual     Mooney So there was a void there. We got together a committee of artists to make  changes, recommend changes.  Little Thunder Were they just from Tahlequah?  Mooney The group stayed pretty much to same. I   m not sure who was there and what  time, but it was Troy Anderson, Bill Rabbit, Jeanne Rorex. They were the  nucleus of it. There was or two or three others I can   t remember. The  recommendations were that we drop the Trail of Tears theme requirement as  part of the show, but retain it as a category. Then allow paintings,  sculptures, and graphics of any theme.  Little Thunder Prior to that, had you had sculptures? Was 3D a category as long as it was  Trail of Tears, or not?  Mooney I don   t think it was. I think it was all painting.  Little Thunder Okay.  Mooney They had at least four categories. Another thing was the artwork had to stay  in the museum for about three months originally. They wanted to have it in  12  and out, tied up less time. I think we did a four-week show at that time.  Then we had a request for more money as prize money. The  Grand Award was  350.  Little Thunder Wow.  Mooney In November of    79, a man name Gene Hallen came to be our development  officer. He worked with Getty Oil Company to be the sponsor of the show.  He always felt that Getty got   passing out these very small checks, he was a  little bit embarrassed by it. Getty increased their support the following year.  In    80 we had a lot of entries. I   m going to guess 180 or so.  Little Thunder And were they from across the country?  Mooney They got more participation in it, yeah. It was more of a national show.  When they got the increased prize money in, then it went up to over 300  pieces at that time. I   m used to coming in there and having four or five  artists carry some work in, maybe one or two arrive by mail at one point. All  of a sudden you   re getting this barrage of mail from the Post Office. You go  down there and many boxes. There   s the bus station sending stuff in, UPS  arriving with it. It got out of hand real fast.  Little Thunder You were the one that took the artwork in?  Mooney Yes. We had another thing going where you go down to Norman or  Oklahoma City and pick up art there from Big Cabin. The timeline of the  show was really pressing because we would have a Sunday deadline on it.  Little Thunder A Sunday deadline?  Mooney One person, he   s from Oklahoma City. They   d get up and down there,  coming back to Tahlequah almost midnight. Then, we spent all night staying  up, segregating the art by category. By this time, we had the miniatures as a  theme because I think it was Troy Anderson that suggested we do this  because people could buy a name artist at a smaller price. It   s been a very  popular category. He was right on that.  Anyway, we   d get all this artwork in middle of the night, almost, on Sunday.  Then, we   d stay up all night there putting all the paintings in one area, the  sculptures over here, and so forth. We   d judge them the next day, judge the  artwork. Then, we   d bring in the guy to hang the stuff. My job got to be  bringing the best of the artwork to the public. Back in this time, we didn   t  have computers or anything. You had to take everything to a typesetter, and  then proofread her stuff. Then, bring it back to make corrections. Then, get  it printed up. It was always an all-nighter on Friday night. We actually  13  opened the show on Friday for a while there, too. We went back to Saturday  later on. It was a severe time crunch.  Little Thunder It sounds like it. You mentioned    we.    There were a couple of other people  who were employees at the Heritage Center who helped with separating out  the artwork into the categories?  Mooney That would be the entire staff. Whoever was there at the time.  Little Thunder Whoever was there at the time     Mooney Yeah, it was all hands on deck for this thing.  Little Thunder How about the early jurying process? How were the judges chosen?  Mooney That was another part of the artist things. They wanted to get away from  using a local judge. They wanted to bring in somebody from maybe New  Mexico or whatever.  Little Thunder Was it a single judge?  Mooney It   s been single, two, three, whatever, depending on the year. I decided that  two judges is about the worst of all worlds because you   d have a strong  judge, a weak judge. One of them will dominate the other. You get one  judge and it all comes from one person. The artist themselves, if they win,  the judge is excellent. If they lose, they didn   t know anything or something.  It   s always a crapshoot on what the judge is liking. Some  judges, I guess   to get into what I   ve seen   I   ve seen the senior side of  judging at this point. Once or twice I   ve seen the judge not give an award to  the artist because,    That guy can do better than that.    You   re fighting  against yourself.  Little Thunder Wow.  Mooney There was one year, we had a thing called a Special Merit Awards. We  didn   t do the one, two, three system, but we did the best of category. Then  we told what awards were to be given in each category. If you had half the  show being painting and the other half being    you might give a lot more  awards, Merit Awards in one category here. I saw one year two judges fight  it out over which of these two Special Merit Awards were for the Best of  Show. They couldn   t agree, so out of nowhere, comes a third piece that is  now Best of Show.  Little Thunder That wasn   t even being considered.  Mooney Yeah.  14  Little Thunder So     Mooney It   s just crazy.  Little Thunder You saw the arbitrariness in some of the decisions.  Mooney There was a judge one year who asked me what I thought. She had it down  to two pieces.  She asked ,    Which one do you like best?    It was the  miniatures. I wouldn   t say anything to her and she finally pushed one.  I  said ,    That one.    That was how that got picked out.  Little Thunder Were there a lot of Native judges, non-Native judges? How did that work  out?  Mooney We tried to. The driving force of the show was Bob Rucker. He came over  from Norman. He   s a collector and everything. He knew a lot of the judges  and so forth. He would pick them out, but there was a pretty good-sized  party the night before the show, the artists coming down. Bob and all of his  friends out there. They had a Pig Award that they   d give out, somebody  wore a pig nose around and collected money     Little Thunder This was not part of the official show?  Mooney That was not part of the official show, no, but it was part of the atmosphere  that went around there.  Little Thunder What were they collecting money for?  Mooney I don   t know. Being pigheaded.  Little Thunder The next round?  Mooney I remember getting Jeanne Rorex to wear this pig nose and carried a pig  under... But anyway, we had a lot of fun back in those days.  Little Thunder The receptions were fun. They did change in character. I remember going to  some receptions that were dinners, and then others that eventually became  just hors d   oeuvres, I guess.  Mooney Part of the thing there is we had to close the museum for the entire day.  Back in that time, nobody got in on opening day other than the people who  had been invited to the dinner.  Little Thunder I see.  15  Mooney We rang a bell, or blew a whistle, and everybody, the doors opened,  everybody would run to a painting and buy something. Now it   s been strung  out to an all-day event, basically. People look at it all day long. Then they  start selling it at six o   clock or so. I didn   t like the lack of decorum about the  people rushing in. Thinking about it the other way now, I kind of wish it was  back in the old days now. I think that had a little excitement about it.  Little Thunder The format of everybody having to kind of compete?  Mooney People come down there and then sneak in   not sneaking in     they   d just go visit the museum. They could see where their paintings were  and they had a little advantage over the people that didn   t know where they  were. So we did have some come in a day ahead of time to scope it out.  They come, put their hand on the sales tag, and say,    This one   s for me.  Mark it up.     Little Thunder Did you actually have to write up some of the invoices too?  Mooney Oh, yes. I did. Very gladly.  Little Thunder Right. Whatever job you needed to take on.  Mooney I think working with the artist has been my most enjoyable part of that job  I   ve had over thirty-eight years. I didn   t know any of them before I came  down there. As a group, they   re just very nice people that I was very pleased  to be with. I   ve always envied somebody who could look at something and  draw it real nice. And just see the different styles. We got some that look  like photographs that might be from photographs sometimes. Others, like  Robby McMurtry, would take a coyote and do something very humorous  with it.  I always enjoyed Robby   s work. I   m not much of an abstract person, but  then I would see some that I did like very well, too. I kind of got into, I  guess, beginning to like an artist   s work because I like the artist. I think  some of them could paint trash, and I still like it. Some guys that if I didn   t  care for a painter, if it was a masterpiece, I   d refuse to admit it. As far as  personal collecting, though, I   m like the Emperor   s new clothes. I go up  there at the start of a new show and I find a piece I just dearly loved. I never  felt right buying it because we are inviting buyers there as our guests and I  didn   t want to jilt them on a piece of artwork. After it went there all night  long without being sold, I think,    What   s wrong with it? Nobody likes this  piece. I   m not going to buy that      Little Thunder That   s interesting.  16  Mooney I went through it one time with Martha Berry, she had a bag in there. I  bought this small one of hers.  Little Thunder Yes. She does lovely work. What   s a favorite story or funny story that you  have about getting to know an artist down there?  Mooney There is one, I don   t know if he   s Cherokee, but it   s that Darren.  Little Thunder  Cooper   Mooney    I think he   s a graphics person. That   s one of the pieces that I got in  trouble with, too. He did a Madonna piece that my wife loved, and I didn   t  buy it and she still holds it against me. He was just this quiet, shy little kid  who came down there.  He   d say to me ,    Uh, uh, can I enter the show?     And I   d say,    Sure anybody can.    Like I said it was very good artwork.  Apparently, he had his work with a gallery or somebody. He worked his  way up to selling from seventy-five dollars up to  750. His prices were way  too cheap. He was just a very good artist.  Little Thunder He didn   t have that much confidence?  Mooney He was very lacking in confidence. One of the things that our shows tried to  do is to build the cottage industry of artists that can make their living here.  Later on, Mike Daniel wanted us to expand the category to include pottery,  of course, but also basketry, and the other five categories we   ve had since  then. I   ve known Mike since we were in childhood. He lived about half a  block from my grandparents here in Tahlequah and we played together all  the time. He talks very loudly. I don   t know if you have ever been around  him that much.  He wanted to  add  ten categories in the show, and I was a little bit  concerned about that, drawing down the purchasing power of the buyers  coming here, that it would dilute it down too much. How we can afford the  prize money to pay these other guys and all kinds of things. I met over at  Linda Greever   s place in Muskogee one time, saw him up there and I was  just messing with him. I said,    Well Mike, we have to drop the Trail of  Tears Art Show. We can   t afford those other categories.       No, no, Tom.     He   s being mad. I was just going on with him. Linda thought we were out  there getting into a fight or something. There   s nothing Mike would ever say  to me I would ever fight him for. I love the guy. Just a little exchange going.  She was very concerned about it, though.  Little Thunder The Trail of Tears category, as I remember, always did have a pretty big  prize purse attached to it.  Mooney Yeah, it   s gotten pretty respectable over the years.  17  Little Thunder And a special medallion.  Mooney That   s a Bob Rucker thing. He had the little Grand Award. Giving the  pendant with the seal inside. He gave a little seal to everybody associated  with the show. I got one myself, as a non-artist, I guess. Special Merit  Award of my own. I still have it and am very proud of it.  Little Thunder How nice. Different artists were asked to do those medallions, weren   t they?  Mooney Not that one. That was a   I think maybe Harvey Pratt may be the designer  of that one. It   s just the Cherokee National Historical Society symbol. It  says,    Sixteenth Annual Show    on there or something like that. He stopped  giving them around the year 2000.  Little Thunder In 1991, with the passage of the Indian Arts and Crafts Act, requiring proof  of enrollment or a letter of certification from the tribe that an artist could  represent that tribe, how did that impact that Trail of Tears art show?  Mooney At first not at all. We were very supportive of those artists who did not have  cards. There   s a lot of arguments today about this biological side, this legal  side of being Cherokee. I think on the one hand, it   s very ludicrous to say  that every Cherokee out there was registered by the Dawes Commission. We  were probably a bit too freewheeling to accept it, though. We just said,    If  you say you are, you are.     I can see the other side of the coin very easily, that if I were a Cherokee  artist with a card, I   d be resentful of somebody coming in there and saying,     I am too.    If they couldn   t offer that proof. It   s like my family itself. If that  Cherokee blood is in my family, then it   s so far back that it   s not really part  of my   who I am made up of. I understand the rules of what they are going  by now with the Dawes Commission being required to do that. There are a  lot of friendships involved there, too. I just felt sorry for my friends.  I thought when they pulled those artists out of the show, it would destroy the  show. I was wrong about that. I think the show has really improved over the  years. It   s getting very strong. I miss those people that we ultimately  rejected. It may have been a bump in the show for a year or two, but I think  people adjusted to it, and it   s back to where it was now. There was some  people that came into the show because they didn   t like being in a show with  the people who didn   t have proof of tribal citizenship, so there   s two sides to  it. I just wish that   A lot of good people got broke up friendships because of  that.  Little Thunder What do you think made and makes the Trail of Tears Show different from,  say, the Five Tribes Show or Art Under the Oaks?  18  Mooney I don   t know, really. It   s a bigger show, I think, than those two. We   ve tried  over the years to bring in   there   s a lot of people from all across the United  States. We tried really hard to involve the Eastern Band of Cherokees. One  argument goes along that if we are mission-related then we wouldn   t take  non-Cherokees in the show. They open the art show in the fall which is a  strictly Cherokee show. It has a little bit different flavor by taking traditional  works like bows and arrows and things.  Little Thunder That strictly Cherokee show has not been going on quite as long has it?  Mooney Since 1995, I believe. The other show, Trail  of Tears , what we did there  with the advice of the artist committee again, was to involve Southwest Art  magazine. See when Getty sold out to Texaco, Texaco was based in  Houston. They took over the show and sponsored it very well. They sort of  insinuated they   d like to have some of the money spent in the Eastern area  so they could justify the sponsorship.  But also when they had Southwest Art magazine, we began using the  Southwest Art judges rather frequently for the show and that gives us a little  publicity that way. They would come down and do an interview with an  artist that was in the show. We tried very much so to get, particularly, New  Mexico and Arizona artists out there and also, a lot of the Eastern band of  Cherokees. The Southwest artists showed up pretty well.  Little Thunder Right. I remember when Susan McGarry came down, I think, the first year  that she was a judge down here. That was another question I had. I think for  many artists, in addition to the Trail of Tears show, then if they had won at  the Trail of Tears a couple of times, you might go ahead and do a  retrospective show for them. I know that you did that for a number of artists.  Any idea how many?  Mooney We were doing one a year there for a while. That was in the early    90s. We  had Cecil Dick, Jeanne Rorex, Troy Anderson, Bill Rabbit     Little Thunder Merlin  Little Thunder      Mooney Merlin and Mavis Doering, I think we did hers. I enjoyed every one of those  shows, too. They were such fun to collect the pieces from their artwork.  Never mind, I won   t tell that story.  Little Thunder You mentioned some changes in the sponsorship.  Mooney I   ll go ahead and tell this one story. It   s going to get me in trouble, too.  Little Thunder Okay.  19  Mooney One of them was Virginia Stroud. There was a gallery in Colorado that  loaned us some pieces of artwork from their clients. They came down here  and we had trouble packing it up to the right size to get it bagged and  everything.  At first, I was supposed to pack it. They   d had somebody else that was  supposed to pack it up for us. That guy quit. They put me back in there.  Then, they hired somebody else. The only common name these people had  was my name. They were very familiar with my name. If I were ever to go  up to Grand Junction, I probably would be dead meat up there. I just     Little Thunder Pieces were shipped when they hadn   t been packed properly?  Mooney We got them back very light. And they were very, very   they had every  right to be as mad as they were. I wasn   t quite as guilty as they thought I  was. I was sure the only one they had a name for.  Little Thunder They arrived intact, it   s just that     Mooney My hands weren   t clean, but they were    (Laughter). It should have been  manslaughter instead of first degree murder.  Little Thunder How about the tribe   s involvement with the museum and the show, the Trail  of Tears Show? How has that changed over the years?  Mooney They   ve supported us over the years by giving us, at first, an annual grant.  Then, since 2005, there has been a thing called the memorandum agreement  where they have significantly helped the support of the museum. It   s  tapering off now. Actually, it should have been sponsored by the Chickasaw  Nation the last four or five years.  Little Thunder What? The show   s been sponsored by Chickasaw Nation?  Mooney Yes.  Little Thunder I did not realize that.  Mooney A lot is Bank of Oklahoma and people like that.  Little Thunder Interesting.  Mooney C herokee Nation  and E nterprise  has given its support to the  Cherokee  Art Market  Oklahoma Art Show because it   s all Cherokee. They have  single handedly made that show success. We owe a lot to C and E on that  show, which is Cherokee Nation, of course. I can   t say they don   t sponsor  20  our shows at all. That   s not true. The Trail of Tears Show itself, I guess it   s  run hot and cold, the support there.  Little Thunder In addition to that all Cherokee show, is that in conjunction with Cherokee  holidays or is it a different time?  Mooney It is now. It didn   t start out that way. It   s been in October. It   s been all over  the map really. We now make it up here, open around the time the Holiday  Show is in effect.  Little Thunder It seems like every aspect of American life and also business was hit hard by  9/11. The Native artists were hit hard by that event, too. I was wondering  how the Trail of Tears Show was affected those first couple of years.  Mooney I   m not sure it had a direct effect there. It   s been, I think it may have been  affected more by the local economies. The oil figures in the    80s and things  that people start coming and buy as much as they can probably buy. It does  have its good years and bad years. I   m sure you know.  Little Thunder Up and down.  Mooney We have certain buyers that come through various years and make the show,  too. I think, the only thing the show is missing now, is the buyers they used  to have. We used to have, given those parts that Bob Rucker had, he would  bring in four or five of his own friends that would buy pretty heavily. That   s  gone way down.  Little Thunder So, now the sales aren   t as strong as they used to be in your estimation?  Mooney Well, thanks to C and E, they are. That   s where the tribal support has come  in there, through C and E.  Little Thunder They will purchase pieces for the     Mooney Our board has stepped up and has been buying pieces.  Little Thunder I see.  Mooney Just the ordinary buyers that collect, I think a lot of them have stopped  coming. We used to have some that we looked forward to seeing every year  and they don   t show up now.  Little Thunder In terms of what is going on right now, foot traffic, what is that like through  the show? What is artist turnout like? Is the prize money roughly the same  or has it grown a little?  21  Mooney The prize money has gone up quite a bit. The sales, they continue to grow.  They really do. Like I say, it   s limited to a smaller group of buyers than it  has been in the past.  Little Thunder So not as many people coming through, just to see the show, on the part of  the public?  Mooney No, I used to go out there on Sundays   we   d open the show on Saturday     and there was always that one group and that   s about all that was in there.  Sunday sales would be about 50 percent of what the Saturday sales were.  That doesn   t happen anymore. People would pay twenty-five dollars to get  in and buy their meals. That was a great deal. You had an open bar there.  You had prime seating at the opening of the drama plus the art show. Only  twenty-five dollars.  Little Thunder Right. Is the drama still scheduled to coincide with the show?  Mooney No, I don   t think it will ever be reopened there. That theatre is in very bad  shape. There were plans to redo the drama, maybe there, but other places  have been talked about too, so I don   t     Little Thunder Right? When did it stop officially?  Mooney I think 2005 may have been the last show. The last performance of the Trail  of Tears by Kermit Hunter was in    96. We began having a series of little  summer events there. I miss it.  Little Thunder I bet. What do you think the impact of the show has been just on the Native  art landscape in northeastern Oklahoma?  Mooney I think clearly it   s helped it a lot. The art people that have relied on that  show for a little extra income, particularly after you added the things that  Mike Daniel wanted to add to the show, like the baskets and all that. We got  a lot of basket makers and pottery. Pottery   s been going really strong now  with Jane Osti and people like that working with it. With their workshops  around here, and we   ve got some very good potters that you didn   t see ten  years ago.  Little Thunder Absolutely. I don   t remember if Anna Mitchell ever entered the show with a  pot?  Mooney Yeah, she did. They did not give her a prize.  Little Thunder She didn   t get a prize?  22  Mooney She gave a workshop over there one time. I used to think potters were just  overrated and over expensive. So I was trying to do a little pot there. I had  pot like that in mind, but that thing started flaring out like this. You had to  go, tap, tap, tap, tap and try to get it back in to pot shape  and then it started  flaring out again. I had a totally different attitude about that after that  workshop. My wife laughed at my finished product. Then she had to take a  class to see if she could make a pot. I got to laugh at hers. As sad as mine  was, it was better than hers. I love potters now. I think they do a great job.  Little Thunder (Laughs) Have you taken several workshops there in other media?  Mooney In basketry.  Little Thunder In basketry.  Mooney I don   t know why they say basketry is for the people who are nuts. That  stuff will run you nuts. The first pattern I did was a fish scale  basket . It   s  three over and three under. I thought surely to God I could count to three.  You look at the last side, there   s two.  Little Thunder It seems like the show has played a role in the whole revival of a lot of  traditional Cherokee arts as well.  Mooney Thank you, Mike Daniel.  Little Thunder (Laughs) On a personal level, you mentioned the Martha Berry piece. Is  there any other art that you especially treasure? That you like to show?  Mooney There is now. Sure. For my retirement, first of all, I got the watch here for  going away. Betty Frond from the Village wove a mat for me, framed it and  everything. It   s called the unbroken friendship. It   s probably twenty by  twenty.  Little Thunder It   s beautiful.  Mooney Just the sentiment behind it is what I really treasure. That   s my new favorite  piece. Around the house, I do have a couple Mike Daniel pots that he would  probably pay me handsomely to take them out. It   s some of his earliest  pieces.  Little Thunder Oh. Yeah, those are valuable.  Mooney These are nothing like what he does now. But I treasure those because again  I   ve known Mike all my life and I treasure that friendship, so I treasure the  pottery.  23  Little Thunder What advice would you give to a Native art collector who was just starting  to acquire Native art?  Mooney I don   t know. I   d say, buy what you like. If you are trying to get it up in  value or something later on, don   t let that be a factor. Just buy what you  want to buy. Now I   m going to get up to these shows and meet the artist,  because to me that   s what makes the pieces special, if you know the person.  I don   t care about these if I don   t know the person. Merlin, I preferred him  for all his mats. You wouldn   t believe. You sure it   s him? Yeah, that   s that  guy. Getting back to Robby McMurtry, too. I remember him and that  coyote. I just, I think it   s a shame the way he died.  Little Thunder Yeah     Mooney We sure lost a good one there.  Little Thunder We did.  Mooney I just can   t believe that. Sure it   s a big mistake that I, I never did   never  knew him to be aggressive like that.  How I felt about leaving the museum after thirty-eight years, you get that  much of your life invested in one place, and it   s a part of you.  Little Thunder It   s not easy is it?  Mooney When I turned the keys over, I thought I was going to have a break down a  moment there. But I did get past that one. It   s just so weird to think that to  go out there now, I   m going to be just another guest. I don   t have a key to  that door.  Little Thunder Right, right.  Mooney I   m still on extended vacation. I haven   t got the reality set in fully. I do  enjoy sleeping in the mornings, though. The hours are great and the pay is  lousy. It   s time to leave though, I think. They have a great guy replacing me  out there, Jerry Thompson. He   s going to do a wonderful job for them, I   m  sure. Of course, I   m always available if they want to call me up and say,     What   s in that box over there?    I   ll try to tell them what I know about it.  Little Thunder Will you volunteer at the art shows anymore?  Mooney Spiritually. The body   s    I got this new van the other day to carry this chair  around. Yeah, if I can get up there to do that, I   ll be glad, too. I can drink  wine legally now too if I go out there. I   m not part of the staff, sitting  around.  24  Little Thunder (Laughs) Is there anything we   ve left out that you would like to add?  Anything we forgot to talk about?  Mooney I don   t think so. Well, I   ll tell you one story about what happened at one of  these judging things. I will name names in this one. It was Dick West and  the guy from I nstitute  of A merican  I ndian  A arts , I think it was  Brophy, I   m not sure. When the show ended, we said goodbye to the judges  and everything. We started talking about the winners and realized that we  didn   t have a winner in one category. We had second, and third, and  honorable mention.  I called Dick West over at Fort Gibson, and said,    Dick, we got a problem  here.     West said ,    Well, can you move second up to first and third up to  second? Do that and pick a third place out of the honorable mentions.     I  said ,    Yeah? Which one?     West said ,    I don   t know. Whatever or  whoever the New Mexican guy goes with, I   ll take it.      I said ,    Okay.    So I let him get back to Mexico, then I called that guy.   I said ,    Whatever Dick said will be good with me.    We finally got them  together and got at least a name. That was one of the biggest mix-ups I had.  Little Thunder That   s a great story. Thank you for sharing that.  -------  -------
