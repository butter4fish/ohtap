Eleanor Roberts:	Miss Matthews, when and where were you born?
Miriam Matthews:	I was born on August 6, 1905, in the city of Pensacola,
located in Escambia County, Florida. I was the second of three children of Reuben Hearde and Fannie Elijah Matthews. My sister, Ella Shaw Matthews, was born nineteen months earlier on January 10, 1904. My brother, Charles Hearde Matthews, followed me sixteen months later, December 12, 1906. Both my parents were born in Pensacola, my father on February 26, 1881, and my mother on January 21, 1883. They were married in the same city on March 30, 1903. My paternal grandparents, Mr. and Mrs. Reuben H. Matthews, Sr., were both schoolteachers. My maternal grandmother was a homemaker, while her husband, Zebulon Elijah, was the first and only Negro postmaster of Pensacola, serving from 1874 to 1878. His political activities are partially revealed in the following letter he received from the Florida secretary of state, dated May 29, 1872.
Dear Sir,
Your letter came to hand and I was glad to hear from you. I wrote to Edward Hughes yesterday, stating that his time was out as County Commissioner in a few days and asked if he wished his appointment renewed. I wish you would attend to this matter at once! A.B. Munn was here and wished the appointment of Mr. Wentworth on the Board of County Commissioners. The Governor is not here and I said I did not think the Governor would appoint him unless you and Hughes and Pons said so. Your Board stands thus:
Fisher,	Commissioned	Feb. 6, 1872
Potter,	Commissioned	May 18, 1872
Hughes,	Expires	June 1, 1872
Rowley,	Commissioned	May 3, 1872
Harrod,	Commissioned	May 3, 1872
Munn said something about Fisher not having the proper qualifications. See if anything is wrong and keep the Board all right. I am sorry you seem to be disgusted with politics. Hold on; do not be in haste. If good men quit the ship, we will all be in the hands of rogues and villains. And we will all suffer for it in the long run.﻿2
MM: (cont) In regard to Greeley, one thing is certain. If the Democrats nominate Greeley at Baltimore, Grant is beaten. If not, his chances are good. Let us not be hasty in our movements but wait on future developments.
Yours truly,
Jonathan C. Gibbs, Secretary of State.
ER: It would appear that your grandfather was held in quite high regard then.
MM: It seems so.
ER: And in a very unique position at that time.
MM: Yes, very unusual. In addition to his appointment as postmaster of Pensacola by President Ulysses S. Grant, and as county commissioner by the governor of
Florida, he i^rved .b registrar of voters, school trustee, and as a member of a special jury, possibly similar to a grand jury. I have documents confirming the above, which were given to me by my mother.
ER: Oh my. Well, how was it that your family came to live here in Los Angeles?
MM: After their wedding, my parents stayed at my paternal grandmother's home,
until the house they were building was completed. Several years later, after they had three children, my parents discussed the matter of segregation and discrimination in the South. Deciding they did not wish their children to be brought up in a segregated atmosphere, they planned to move to California, selling their home and furniture at reduced prices to get a ready sale.
Our family came to California on the Santa Fe Railway, accompanied by my father's brother, Albion Dunbar Matthews. He was next to my father in age. I forgot to mention that my father was the second oldest in a family of seven. He had a sister, who died when she was eighteen, who was older. And then there was a younger sister who died as a baby; so the five brothers were the only ones who grew up to manhood. My mother was the tenth of twelve children, but several of her mother's children died as infants.
Those were the days when one had to get off the train to eat at the Harvey Houses, at least those who traveled via the Santa Fe Railway. During the trip when the train took a fast curve I was thrown into the aisle on my head and miraculously escaped injury. My Uncle Albion said jokingly that I had a hard head!
Although there was segregation on the trains at that time, there were no separate cars for Negroes. White and Negro passengers were separated by a curtain, which could be moved easily to expand either section. When the Negro section was getting too crowded in our car, my father, who appeared to be white, went to find the conductor. He asked the conductor to come move the curtain. Not realizing my father was a Negro, he replied, "Yes, yes, yes." When they reached our car, and he discovered my father wanted him to﻿3
MM: (cont) give the Negroes more space, he cursed him and did not move the curtain.
ER: The conductor?
MM: Yes, the conductor. It shows you what conditions were like at that time.
Our train trip took eight days. We left Pensacola on Sunday, July 21, 1907, and arrived in Los Angeles on Monday, July 29, at nine in the morning.
ER: Where exactly did you live here in California?
MM: For a few days we stayed with my father's godfather, Mr. Dunbar, and his wife who lived in Inglewood, close to Los Angeles. Our first home was on Lawrence Street in Los Angeles. I intended to look it up on a map. I do know it was located east of Central Avenue, and in the neighborhood of Ninth Street. My father started buying the house after we had been there a short while, and we remained there between one and two years. Deciding he was paying too much for the house, my father let it go, since he had made no down payment, and the monthly payments were equivalent to the regular rental fee. Even though there were a number of whites living on Lawrence Street, my parents decided they wanted to move to a different neighborhood. I don t remember how many Negro families there were on our block, although that was an area of town where a number of Negroes lived, but not necessarily on one street. There were comparatively few Negroes in the city at that time. As a matter of fact, my mother said when she went downtown when she first arrived, she never saw another black face. And she felt so lonesome. And she put a telephone in the house even though she had no real friends, just so she d have something to use, but she did feel that if there was an emergency, at least she could call the doctor. Our family doctor, our first family doctor, was Dr. John Outlaw who was one of the early physicians here in California. I believe he arrived around 1903, and he became quite a good friend. And interestingly enough about accents, my mother had been going to him for some time and one day she happened to say, "I reckon," and he said, "Mrs. Matthews, do you come from the South?" And she said, "Yes, I thought you knew that." He said, "Not until you said, 'I reckon.'" And he said, "If I were you, I would eliminate that from my vocabulary." And so it's interesting that with all the contact he'd had with her, that was the only thing that made him think that she might have been from the South, because her speech was not typically southern at all. As a matter of fact, my mother spoke very rapidly and you see, that's not true generally of southerners.
£R: Right.
MM: And she enunciated clearly. As a matter of fact, I seem to have inherited many of her qualities. We both walk fast, talk fast, and my mother said, a great-grandmother of mine talked so rapidly—in fact, she thought I was much faster than she was in speech—and she said the great-grandmother talked so fast, all you could catch would be the first word and the last word of the sentence.
ER: The beginning and the end.
MM: I'll go back to our initial home on Lawrence Street. As I mentioned, there﻿4
MM: (cont) were white people. In fact, I don't remember how many Negro families, although that was an area of town where a pretty good number of Negroes lived, but not necessarily on one street.
In 1900, the 2,100 Negroes represented two percent of the city's 102,000 inhabitants. Although their numbers increased to 7,600 by 1910, Negroes accounted for only a slightly higher percentage of the total population. William M. Mason, curator of archives at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, has drawn a map, showing the location of Negroes in Los Angeles just before 1900, which shows they were rather widely distributed. His survey revealed, also, that a large percentage, possibly ninety percent, of the Negroes eligible to vote were registered and cast their ballots religiously. This would indicate that the Negroes who came to Los Angeles were individuals with initiative and an interest in assuming their roles as citizens. Just as my parents came to California to escape segregation, that was probably the motive of others, too, to be free.
.ER: That's interesting. Do >ou recall at all how you were received? How your
family was received when you first moved there on Lawrence Street among white people? Do you recall your mother saying...
MM: I do not recall my parents mentioning any racial incidents. You see, my mother would have to tell me since I was...
ER: Tiny.
MM: . . .a year and eleven months old when we arrived. In fact, it was a week before my second birthday, and we only stayed there a couple of years, so I wasn't very old, but I don't recall them mentioning any difficulties with white neighbors on Lawrence Street. We seem to have gotten along very well with our neighbors, who were all very friendly.
ER: From Lawrence Street where did the family move?
MM: We moved to the 700 block on East 17th Street, between Griffith Avenue and
San Pedro Street. We had rented one house for less than a year when the house next door was placed on sale. Little did we dream, when we moved into the house at 739 East 17th Street in 1910, that it would be our home for the next forty years! The day we moved in, my sister and I came down with the measles, so they had to set up our beds quickly and tuck us in. My mother certainly did not appreciate the added nursing chores, while trying to get the house fully organized.
ER: Incredible!
MM: When we moved on 17th Street, there were very few Negro residents. Through
the years it gradually changed color, although not completely. In the beginning, the whites were mainly Anglo-Saxon, and one of the original families remained on the street after we moved, finally being forced out by the construction of the Santa Monica freeway. At various times our street was invaded by various first-generation Europeans, Mexicans, and other ethnic groups. There was one unhappy incident involving an Armenian family that moved next door at the time The Birth of a Nation, D.W. Griffith's Ku Klux Klan film,﻿5
MM: (cont) was showing at the local motion picture theaters for the first time. It was advertised by a lurid poster on a corner billboard. When they got angry, the Armenian children called us names and suggested that we go look at the billboard on the corner. My mother went to see their parents and told them, "You should be thankful that you are in America, where you don't have to flee for your lives or be beaten to death by the Turkish people. You should show proper respect for people who have been American citizens for generations, and are your superiors in education and income. It seems incredible that they would have the temerity to try to look down on us because we were Negroes.
ER: Probably had an overwhelming need to do just that.
MM: That was an isolated incident. The Armenians became good neighbors after that encounter with my mother. As young people growing up in the public schools of that period, we were not too conscious of our race.
ER:
I'd like t" isk " ~ ■ abc-:t 7.-,tsr parents' occupations, and T'd like to move on to your schooling. Your father was a painter?
MM: Yes, and a good one, too. He received his training at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The day after our arrival in Los Angeles, my father went out to look for a job and luckily found work right away. A short time later he was employed by Cooper, Pyle and Clopine, a firm of building contractors. His work was so superior he was made a working foreman and then a foreman. Eventually, he managed everything in connection with the painting of new homes built by the firm. In the event the homes were sold before they were painted, he conferred with the new owners, wrote up the specifications and completed the work according to their instructions. This experience proved very valuable to him when he went into business with two partners in 1919. A short time^ later he discovered his two partners had little to offer except a good day s labor. My father had a list of prospective customers, the ability to figure, and manage the jobs, and owned the equipment, my mother took the messages, kept the business records and figured the income tax. The partnership was dissolved a year later and my father, Reuben Hearde Matthews, built a successful business by himself. Most of his customers were wealthy white people. Since he maintained high standards and guaranteed his work, his clients always recommended him to their friends. He kept a large crew of painters busy except during the depression years, and remained in business until a short time before his death in 1949.
ER: Aid what was your mother's occupation? Was she home...
MM: Yes. She had planned to be a teacher, but gave up a normal schoolteacher's course to get married. She became a homemaker and never worked outside the home. An excellent dressmaker, she made all of her children's clothes and most of her own. Endowed with a good mind and a sound education, she was able to help the three of us with our lessons, when we needed help, all through high school. She took adult education classes in bookkeeping, Spanish, and other subjects in which she was interested. My father appreciated her ability to manage the family finances, and gave her his weekly pay envelopes unopened, until he went into business for himself. In good times and bad, my mother always managed to save something on a regular basis, yet she saw that we had the basics for good living. This greatly influenced the three﻿6
MM: (cont) children in the family after we became adults, for we always remembered her words, "Save something from every paycheck."
ER: Saving for that rainy day, as it were. What was the socioeconomic level that your family fell in, or category? Can you recall?
MM: Well, we said "middle class" in those days, but compared with what is termed "middle class" today, one might say in the beginning we were "lower middle class." We were always well fed, well dressed and comfortable. We had a piano, and all of us took music lessons. We attended dancing school to learn social dancing. Our first automobile was purchased in 1917; and we did not have to work our way through college. For that period, I'm certain one would consider our family "middle class".
ER: Where did you go to elementary school, and what do you recall about that experience?
MM: The elementary school was right atourid the corner.
ER: From 17th Street?
MM: Yes, but first I might mention that while we were living on Lawrence Street, my sister who was nineteen months older than I, attended a nursery school at the Episcopal Church Neighborhood House a few blocks away. It cost only a few cents a day to attend. One day Ella told my mother she could bring a visitor the next day and suggested that she take me. I went with her and enjoyed it tremendously. Even though I was below their minimum age, the teacher told me I could come every day. My Uncle Albion overheard me relaying this information to my mother and said, "Miriam, you made a hit with the teacher, didn't you?" I answered, "No, I never fight."
ER: So cute.
MM: This preschool training at Neighborhood House was good preparation for elementary school. After we moved to East 17th Street, we attended the San Pedro Street Elementary School, starting with kindergarten and continuing from the first through the sixth grade. In those days the parents had to buy the textbooks. My mother always heard our lessons. While she was helping my sister with her first grade reader, I listened, and since I was interested, my mother taught me to read it from cover to cover. The state education code would not permit me to enter the first grade until I was six years old, however. They used the same reader for an entire year. After I had used this reader in the lower half of the first grade, my mother feared I might become bored, so she visited the principal to have me skipped to the second grade. When they came to my room to get me, the teacher said: "There are ^ plenty of children in this room as smart as Miriam." "That's not my concern, my mother replied, "I came only to see about my daughter." Later I skipped the second half of the third grade. Some of my teachers wanted to skip me in the fourth, fifth and sixth grades, but my mother would not give her consent because she felt I might miss something which might prove important to my later development. Oh, I do remember one rather interesting little incident. I had the mumps when I was in the third grade...﻿7
ER: Oh great. Remember those?
MM: . . .and I didn't have a serious case. As a matter of fact, with all of the diseases my sister seemed to get it first, and she would have a mild case. Then I was the second one in line, and I would have a slightly harder time. Then when it came to my brother, he was always the worst of all. And so I was practically over the mumps, and it was in the early afternoon, after the people had gone back to the classes, after lunch, and I picked some flowers, and took them over to the school and knocked on my teacher's door and handed the flowers to her. She knew why I was out of school, and she said, "Now, you hurry straight home," because she didn't want me to come in contact with any of the other children.
ER: Make a beeline straight for home.
MM: All three children in our family had the same teachers, and they knew our
mother, too, since she visited the school from time to time to check on our prottres®. We had ? very pleasant time throughout our elementary school days, studying and playing happily with both black and white classmates, although there were only a few of the former. One year we attended summer school at the Ninth Street School, in a neighborhood where there were more Negroes. All the pupils from San Pedro Street School who were attending summer school there were white, and we played together since we were friends. One day a Negro child looked straight at me and said: "She thinks she's passing." When I asked my mother what she meant, she explained it tactfully and I soon forgot all about it.
ER: What about your experience in secondary schools?
MM: When I went to intermediate, they wanted to skip me the A-7's and my mother said no again, and two or three of my classmates were skipped. I did very well in terms of grades all the way through school, beginning with elementary through junior high. My brother, sister, and I attended 14th Street Intermediate School, which later was renamed the Lafayette Junior High School. There was a choice in those days: to transfer to high school for four years after completing the eighth grade, or taking the ninth grade at intermediate school, and spending only three years at high school. Our family chose the latter. We received a certificate or diploma after finishing both the eighth and ninth grades.
ER: Did the parents make that decision? Or was it the teachers?
MM: The parents. I was in the honor society every semester except one. That was the winter of 1918-19, when a severe epidemic of influenza forced them to close all the schools. Homework was mailed to the students. Those who completed it satisfactorily were marked "Passed", and those unable to do the work due to illness were marked "Not Passed." Our house was the only one in the block without at least one case of influenza. And when I went to high school, the Spanish I took as ninth grade Spanish at the intermediate school was being given in the tenth grade at the high school. So this gave me a chance to take two extra subjects. And I happened to take things that were required subjects, and so that made me graduate a half a year earlier, even though I wasn't expecting to, and I hadn't skipped anything. I did ask at﻿8
MM: (cont) at one time to take some extra subjects, and they sent me to the school nurse and she said, when she found out how old I was, that I was too young, and for me to just take the regular curriculum and not worry about taking anything extra. I graduated high school at sixteen.
ER: What did the nurse mean, you were too young to take additional...
MM: Well she felt being young, I didn't need to rush out and overwork myself taking some extra courses. Because I was graduating early enough as it was. The entire student body was asked to write an impromptu essay on a patriotic subject during World War I, and I won the second prize. I attribute this partly to an excellent English teacher, Miss Linn, who inspired all her students to do good work. Many years after college, I came across a dramatization of Dickens's David Copperfield which I did for one of her classes, and I was astonished at the quality of the work, which was far above the junior high school level. She ranks high among the half-dozen teachers who influenced me most during my school years, including college.
ER: What was the name of your high school?
MM: Los Angeles High School. This school was outside our district, but since
our grandmother lived in the district, we used her address to register there. When we arrived in the city, Los Angeles was the only high school. My mother was determined that we should go there, even though there were other good high schools more conveniently located. Besides being the oldest, Los Angeles High School also had a tradition for excellence. A number of the city's "best families" sent their children there. About two years before my sister graduated from junior high school, Los Angeles High School was moved from its downtown location to Olympic and Rimpau Boulevards, which was practically out in the country at that time. Students had to walk a mile after they got off the streetcar at the end of the line, cutting through vacant lots, high with weeds. A few squirrels scampered about the campus, especially at lunch-time.
Some prejudice was encountered in certain areas by the small group of Negroes who were at the high school in those days. For example, Marian Robinson had filed to run as a candidate for the senior board, and the faculty advisers forced her to withdraw her name. Now even though she might have been defeated, they did not want to take that chance. Maybe the student body president might do a lot of campaigning, so they would recognize them and know who they were, but the senior board would have a dozen people and they might not know any of the names and they'd just vote for a name they liked. So they asked her to take her name off. Mr. Goddard, our twelfth-grade English teacher, gave my sister an F on her mid-term report card without giving her the customary unsatisfactory notice beforehand. My father went to see Mr. Housh, the principal, after school and he took him to Mr. Goddard's room. The principal opened the conversation by saying: "The father of one of your students has come to visit." Mr. Goddard smiled broadly until the principal mentioned my father's name. Then he turned red in the face.
ER: I'm sure he did.
MM: After my father stated his case, Mr. Goddard said, "Miriam is quite smart,
and I'm sure she can help Ella bring up her grade." The next time we had an﻿9
MM: (cont) essay to write, I wrote both my sister's essay and mine. I received a B plus and my sister a C. It was evident he was not basing his grades on the quality of the work. At the end of the semester, I received a B, and my sister a C in the course. Other students in the class who did not perform nearly as well as I were given A's. There were only a few teachers at Los Angeles High School like Mr. Goddard, thank goodness; otherwise I would not have qualified for scholastic honors. Most of the teachers were kind and unbiased, and I have many pleasant memories of my association with them. I was elected to the Periclean Honor Society in the twelfth grade, and became a member of the California State Scholarship Federation when I graduated with senior honors. Also, I was a candidate for the Ephebian Society, an honor society composed of students of the graduating classes of the city chosen on the basis of excellence in scholarship, character and leadership. A friend of mine overheard two of my teachers who voted for me, saying I was not one of the four finalists because some faculty members felt I had not yet demonstrated leadership.
ER: It's clearly my impression that you were an exceptional student. Were you treated as such, or did you always have to go up against the various odds?
MM: No, I was never too conscious of being a good student, and there were only
a few occasions when I felt I had not received the proper grade. My brother, Charles, also finished high school when he was sixteen years old.
ER: What were your specific courses of study, in high school, leading to college? Did you have college preparatory courses?
MM: Yes, I was taking what was listed as the college preparatory course. I had the required courses in English, history, science, mathematics and social problems. Only one foreign language was required, but I elected to take both Spanish and French. I took other elective courses, also. My interest in foreign languages in high school led to my decision to major in Spanish in college.
I wanted to take French in the tenth grade as soon as I reached high school. My counselor said, "No, you'll get confused. You had better wait a while before you start a second language." She signed me up for a course that was supposed to be an art course, but it turned out to be mainly sewing. It doubtless was on the college preparatory list, but it did not appeal to me in the least. In some cases, however, counselors did sneak me in one or two courses which were not on the college preparatory list, which would force some students to spend an extra semester or year at high school to get ready for college. If parents could not afford this extra expense, then the students would generally give up the idea of going to college.
ER: So parents had no say-so, whatsoever, in terms of the courses their youngsters took at the time? You had a counselor who made those decisions?
MM: If the parents were alert, there was a published catalog or list which could
be checked to see whether or not their children were taking the proper courses. They could insist on changes being made, if they were not scheduled for the right courses.
ER: There was something you were going to tell me about your graduation...﻿10
MM: Yes. Originally I was supposed to graduate in the summer of 1922, one
half year after my sister, who was in the winter class of 1922. About a month before the winter commencement, the counselor called me into her office to tell me I would be graduating with the winter class. I said, "Oh no, I'm supposed to graduate in the summer." She replied, "You have completed all the requirements so we are putting you out!" This situation occurred because I skipped tenth grade Spanish at Los Angeles High School, since it was the identical course I had had in the ninth grade at 14th Street Intermediate School. This gave me an opportunity to select two extra courses, and fortunately I chose required subjects. When I went home and told my mother the news, she was side about it! She was overwhelmed by the thought of making two graduation dresses on such short notice. She became so nervous that she could not make even one dress, and had to engage two dressmakers to make them for us. She always made our clothes, and when I was mentioning about how we were dressed, she bought the finest linens and embroidery and lace and ginghams and materials. One of her sisters had been a very fine modiste and worked for very wealthy people. She had a shop and had people assisting her too, and so she trained my mother and trained her to do very careful work.
ER: Her sister was in Florida or did she move here as well?
MM: In Florida. No, she didn't move here. That was when my mother was young. See, my mother was the youngest girl in the family. She had one brother who was younger then she was. And this sister was much older. So it was like her daughter in a way, in terms of years. My mother's mother died when she was about fourteen, so you see, she didn't have anyone to look after her except the older sisters after fourteen. So my mother made very lovely clothes for us, and she made some of her own, too, except for the tailored things. And one of my Sunday school teachers... Every year the Episcopal church, after Easter, they would have all of the Sunday schools to come to the cathedral to present their mite boxes, at least the money that they saved in their mite boxes during Lent. And all of the Sunday schools marched across the stage with their banner, or maybe a selected few, because if they had all of them to go it would take too long. I remember my Sunday school teacher said we looked just as well as those wealthy children from the other parishes. And she was always proud to take us. And so that's why I mentioned my mother was going to make our dresses, but she was so excited about both of us graduating that she didn't make either dress, she had to give them to dressmakers to make.
ER: Caught her off guard.
MM: And I don't know why, because she could have made one dress, and she hadn't started my sister's yet.
Mr. Goddard, the English teacher I referred to earlier, was responsible for all the graduation arrangements, including senior honors for the students with high scholarship. When I learned that he had notified all those who were supposed to be eligible for senior honors, except me, I secured my transcript from my homeroom teacher, and showed it to him, asking why he had not called me. After making a pretense of looking over my grades, he said, "Oh yes, you are all right." Those with senior honors, in addition to other privileges, were supposed to be seated right behind the faculty﻿11
MM: (cont) and speakers on the night of graduation. Mr. Goddard had already arranged the seating and refused to change it to put me near the front. The seats were elevated on the stage so everyone in the class was visible. My sister, Ella, Lois Towns, and I were seated together in the third row from the top. Evangeline Lewis, a fourth Negro student, was in the same row, but on the opposite side of the platform. Italians and other dark Europeans were placed in the top rows, also. So they discriminated against them too.
But that was the only thing he refused to do. And I didn't make a fuss about that. Strangely enough, I was a rather shy and retiring person all through high school, and even most of college in some ways, but not as much in college. Yet I did this matter of going to see him about this without even consulting my parents in advance. And later on in work, even though I wasn't what I'd call a brash, forward-type person, I always quietly said my piece when I thought something was not right.
Now the winter that my sister and I graduated from Los Angeles High School, there were four Negroes graduating from Los Angeles High School; Ralph Bunche was graduating from Jefferson High School and there were six Negroes. So you see, Jefferson had a large white population at the time.
ER: What about the social side of your high school experience? I recall your
saying that administrators and teachers didn't encourage young black students to run for any office, so I assume you weren't a leader in student government .
MM: In answer to your second question, I was definitely not a leader in student government. As for our social life at Los Angeles High, there was none. Most of the high schools generally held their senior proms in hotels where Negroes were not welcome. I know we did not participate in a senior prom the year we graduated.
However, when there were programs in the auditorium for the entire student body, Negro students were included. Naida McCullough, an excellent pianist, played a very difficult classical piece one day which started out with a thunderous crash of chords, and then suddenly was very subdued. A student nearby whispered, "She can treat the piano gently, can't she?" The audience was greatly impressed and applauded Naida enthusiastically. Several Negroes contributed their musical talents on other programs, playing classical music also, not jazz. Speakers for these meetings were generally adults from the community or the faculty, that is why the students were featured in musical numbers or possibly a skit.
ER: I want to ask about the grading system in the secondary public schools of
Los Angeles. You were a good student and I was wondering, a lot of students sweat and strain under the pressure of grading systems and since the 1920s, '30s and '40s, the grading system has become somewhat more lenient. I was wondering, was there a tough grading system when you were in high school?
MM: I thought it was standard for then, and I have no basis for making a comparison with later periods. The only comment I can make about grades﻿12
MM: (cont) concerns the two major universities at the time—the University of California, Southern Branch (later called the University of California at Los Angeles), and the University of Southern California, a private school. Some students who could not qualify for the University of California were accepted by the University of Southern California. It was easier to earn an A at the University of Southern California than it was at the state university, where the standards were definitely higher.
ER: There are those who maintain that this is still the case.
MM: My sister was dating a young man who was going to the University of Southern California, and he said to me, "You can't afford to go to U.S.C., that is why you are going to the state university." I replied, "If there are two stores on the same street selling the same suits, only in one store the price is $100 less than in the other, would you patronize the more expensive store?"
ER: Just for the sake of going there. Were there any minority teachers at Los Angeles High School?
MM: No, not while I was there. It was actually thirty years before there were any on the staff. The first two were Charles Thomas and Josephine Blodgett Smith, who started teaching at Los Angeles High in the physical education and home economics departments in 1952. At that date, the administrators at Los Angeles High were apprehensive about the reaction of white students to a Negro classroom teacher.
Earlier appointments had been made to Eastside secondary schools. Hazel Gottschalk Whitaker was assigned to Jefferson High School in 1936, and Clarissa Lovinggood Matthews, my sister-in-law, to Carver Junior High School in 1937. During the next decade occasional appointments of Negro secondary teachers were made to Eastside schools.
In view of the long,drawn out controversy over desegregation in the Los Angeles city schools, which still is not resolved, it might be of interest to point out a few historic facts on the Negro in the city's educational system. When the teachers' examination was given for the Los Angeles City School District in 1911, Bessie Bruington Burke, a Negro, placed seventh in a field of eight hundred. Despite this fact, it took a lot of community pressure to secure her appointment as a teacher, the first of her race in Los Angeles. Starting her teaching career at the Holmes Avenue School in Furlong Tract in 1911, she became the first Negro principal in Los Angeles seven years later. Before her retirement in 1955, she served as principal of four elementary schools, including Holmes Avenue.
As far as I know, only two Negroes managed to secure teaching assignments away from Holmes Avenue School before 1920: Cornelia Leggett Bradford, who went to Staunton Avenue School, and Iva Washington to Macy Street School. For a number of years the Los Angeles city schools stopped hiring Negro teachers when there were no vacancies at Holmes Avenue School. This forced a number of individuals to teach in the segregated schools of El Centro, in the Imperial Valley about 200 miles from Los Angeles. It was customary﻿13
MM: (cont) to mark "c" for "colored" behind the names of Negroes on the eligible
teachers list. There still may be some kind of identifying symbol for Negroes, despite the number who have risen today to the rank of area supervisor, and one to the rank of deputy school superintendent.
While white teachers are resisting transfers to the inner city schools, and white parents are opposing the busing of their children to achieve desegregation in the Los Angeles city schools, nothing is being said about the days when the Los Angeles city schools paid the carfare of both black and white students to hasten segregation. When my sister-in-law first taught at Carver Junior High School, she would have a large percentage of white students at the beginning of the semester, and within a few weeks a number of the white students had disappeared and were replaced by Negroes.
Fay Allen was the first Negro elected to the Los Angeles City Board of Education back in 1939, when all school board members were elected on a citywide basis without regard to numbered offices. Most of the teachers, blae1- \>- ■ vM.f , .-. »ng ? r praises, because she was the first school board member to make regular visits to the schools to find out firsthand what their problems were. Every morning for several weeks Mrs. Allen stood on the corner of Jefferson Boulevard and San Pedro Street (a streetcar transfer point), watching Negro students coming from the west going east to school, and white students coming from the east going west to school. Her efforts to change this practice and implement other needed reforms did not make her popular with certain groups. They managed to defeat her, when she ran for a third term in 1943, by placing a white housewife named Allen first on the ballot, confusing the voters who wished to vote for Fay Allen. If there had been one more vacancy on the board, she would have been elected since she was next in line. Long before the election, an incumbent board member had announced his intention to resign, but was persuaded to wait until after the election to do so, thereby giving the school board the privilege of appointing his successor. Since she had polled the next largest number of votes in the election, and was a woman of experience, Mrs. Allen was the logical appointee, but of course, they chose a white person. It was a number of years before another Negro succeeded in being elected to the board of education.
ER: How unfortunate! Since you said there was no social life for Negroes at your high school, what did you do for entertainment off campus?
MM: On Friday evenings we would go to the homes of different friends, roll back the carpets and dance. All those who knew how to play the piano would take turns providing the music for us to dance by. The host mother would furnish the refreshments, which would be fruit punch and cookies, generally. Larger parties or dances were given occasionally at the Saint Philip's Episcopal Church parish hall, the Masonic Hall and, a few other places. Our social life was simple, but we had a lot of fun...
ER: What kind of dances did you do then?
MM: Mainly the one-step, the two-step and the fox-trot, and the waltz, until the Charleston became the craze when we were in college.﻿14
ER: What were the rules at that time? Did young people have the freedom they have today?
MM: No indeed. Mothers were on hand everywhere to act as chaperons. Most of the girls danced only with other girls until they were sixteen years old. In most cases they did not go on dates alone with young men until they were eighteen. After my brother got his first pair of long trousers, my mother did permit the three of us to go to house parties without her in the family automobile.
ER: I guess makeup and things like that were just unheard of?
MM: During our high school and early college years, we used a little rice
powder and a pale pink pomade lipstick. Unless you were very forward, you did not use real lipstick or rouge on your cheecks.
ER: Well, I guess you and your peers played by the code and obeyed the rules so...
MM: Pretty much. During my junior year at the University of California in Berkeley, a number of people from Los Angeles drove up to attend the football game between Berkeley and the University of Southern California. Only one coed drove up in a car with a young man who was not accompanied by a chaperon, and she was the talk of the town!
ER: Sure. Scandalous! You went to the University of California, Southern... how did they say...
MM: They said University of California, Southern Branch. It was called a branch at that time.
ER: Instead of U.C.L.A.?
MM: Yes. In the beginning the Southern Branch was not a four-year college.
It had a two-year liberal arts course and a normal school. The latter was attached originally to the Los Angeles High School.
ER: What was a normal school?
^M: The normal school was a two-year college course for teachers. When students completed this course, they were ready to start teaching. Eventually, the standard teaching course was increased to three years, and finally to four. Students enrolled in the two-year liberal arts course at the Southern Branch transferred to a four-year college to earn their bachelor's degree.
Although the University of California, Southern Branch, became a four-year college in 1925, I chose to go to Berkeley anyway, since attending college in my hometown seemed like a continuation of high school. Being on my own away from home was a valuable experience for me. It developed my character and made me more independent. My brother, Charles, transferred to Berkeley in 1924, too, although he was a year behind me in college. Our parents deposited sufficient funds in our checking accounts in the beginning to last an entire year, and it was our responsibility to budget it for that period. Later, they gave us a large sum at the beginning of each semester for initial expenses, and then sent us a monthly allowance check. I was able to manage﻿15
MM: (cont) my funds to better advantage than my brother, purchasing occasional items for my wardrobe and gifts for the family at Christmas. Apparently he ate more than I did, and possibly at more expensive restaurants. There were four of us traveling on the Daylight Limited train to Los Angeles for the Christmas and summer vacations—my brother, Charles Diggs, and Erskine Ragland. Since the boys were usually broke when it was time to return home, I always prepared a lunch for them to eat on the train.
When I first went to Berkeley I weighed 127 pounds, and before the semester was over my weight had risen to 146 pounds. Before I left Berkeley three years later, I was wearing gloves three-quarters of a size larger, and shoes a whole size larger, even though I was nineteen years old when I arrived there. Since I was not eating more, I can attribute these changes only to the climate.
ER: What was Berkeley like when you went to school there? We all have our own pictures of it now.
-EI. From 1924 to 1927 and later as well, Berkeley was calm and peaceful, a
typical conservative college town. The same atmosphere prevailed on campus, where a bonfire rally or a football game produced the greatest excitement among the students.
When you say, "We all have our own pictures of it now," I imagine you are referring to the campus protests and riots of the sixties. As bad as those years were, the entire student body was not involved and classroom instruction was not brought to a standstill. My nephew, Charles H. Matthews, Jr., was attending Berkeley at the time, and he said the students who did not wish to encounter the pickets at Sather Gate simply used other entrances to the campus in order to attend their classes. After the instigators of the Berkeley riots left for other universities, the campus returned to normal. That is not to say, it is like it was back in the twenties. All of us know there have been many dfaanges throughout the country since then, which are reflected in our various institutions and in our lives.
ER: i agree. Did you live in a boardinghouse up there or with someone?
There were no dormitories ±n Berkeley in those days for black or white students. I was the only student rooming in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Leon F. Marsh at 2838 Grant Street, which was about a twenty-five minute walk from the campus. My brother, Charles, Erskine Ragland and Charles Diggs lived with Mrs. Dewberry, who had a large home on Grove Street around the corner from the Marshes.
1 first met Mrs. Marsh, Vivian Osborne Marsh, when she came to Los Angeles in the spring of 1923 to establish Pi Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority on the campus of the University of California, Southern Branch. I was one of the five charter members of Pi Chapter and its first vice-president. Marion Carter Moore was the first president. Mrs. Marsh was the "Mother" of Delta in the West, having established most of the chapters of the sorority in the western states. She held many national offices in the twenties and thirties, including grand vice-president and president. Vivian and I have remained friends through the years, and I was her house guest last November when I attended my 50th college class reunion in Berkeley! Isn't that unusual?﻿16
ER: Terrific, absolutely terrific. Were there many—I guess there weren't,
but just for the record—were there many minority students going to Berkeley when you were in college there?
MM: Not too many, and a number of them came from the Los Angeles area. When I went to Berkeley, it was the place to go. It had the most renowned faculty members and an outstanding reputation. At that time the university at Berkeley had the largest enrollment in the state, but now U.C.L.A. greatly exceeds Berkeley in size and has for some years.
ER: Student enrollment; well, it's sort of a commuter place now.
MM: I believe that's true. But when I went to the University of California, Southern Branch, the campus was small and located on Vermont Avenue right in the city. It was moved to Westwood in 1927 or 1928, I believe, when its real growth began. It was a wonderful experience for me attending a small college my first two years, and then transferring to a large university. I enjoyed the intli^-y of the campus in Los Angeles, and the personal contact with my professors and classmates. As a rule, I made better grades when my classes were small enough for me to recite in class. At the University of California in Berkeley my classes were very large (with a few exceptions) and were held in huge study halls. The roll was taken by the seats that were vacant. If you were absent and someone sat in your seat, then you were marked present. Your entire grade depended on the midterm and final examinations, unless the professor assigned a term paper. If a student happened not to be feeling well on the day his final examination was given, he would receive a poor grade even though he might have a good knowledge of the subject.
ER: Things must have stayed that way for a long while, because when I was at Penn State University, we had the...
MM: Same thing.
ER: ...same midterm, final, and you sank or swam.
MM: Being a Spanish language major at Berkeley was lucky for me because those classes were small, most of them having from eight to twelve students. I was elected to Sigma Delta Pi, the Spanish honorary society, in my senior year. During my four years of college I took the required courses in science, history, English, public speaking, philosophy, and social problems; also, four years of Spanish (with two courses a semester during my upper division years), four years of French, two years of German and one semester of Italian. The bachelor of arts degree was conferred upon me in May, 1926, when I was twenty years old, even though I waited a half-year to enter college after graduating from high school.
ER: When did you decide to become a librarian?
MM: Most of my Negro girl friends were planning to be teachers, but that was the one profession I decided I did not wish to follow. For this reason I took a liberal arts course, planning to specialize after receiving my A.B. degree. When I was a sophomore at the University of California, Southern Branch, I studied most of the time with Charlotte Cavell, a white friend who was in﻿17
MM: (cont) most of my classes. One day when we were walking across the campus, Charlotte happened to mention that she planned to be either a physical education teacher or a librarian. Somehow the profession of librarian seemed to strike a responsive chord and I said, "That's a good idea!" Without reading any books on the subject or consulting a librarian, I kept this thought in the back of my mind until a few weeks before graduation. Then I filed an application for admission to the School of Librarianship at Berkeley. The director of the library school, Sidney Mitchell, told me they would select the thirty highest in scholarship for the next class. Naturally I was delighted when I received my letter of acceptance shortly after I returned home. My family and a number of friends tried to discourage me from taking the course in library science, because they said I would not get a job. Incidentally, Charlotte Cavell became a librarian, too. This might be an appropriate time to mention that before it was generally known that I did not plan to teach, a number of friends, classmates, and even professors told me they thought I would make an excellent teacher, much to my surprise. Dr. Millard Rosenberg, a professor I had for Spanish at University of California, Southern Branch, corresponded with me the three years I attended Berkeley. Without my saying a word, he assumed I was going to teach Spanish. When I received my A.B. degree, he sent my name to several of his publishers asking them to send me complimentary copies of Spanish textbooks. Although he was disappointed to learn I was enrolling in the School of Librarianship, a year later he gave me a glowing recommendation when I took the Civil Service examination for the Los Angeles Public Library.
ER: What was your parents' attitude about educating a daughter or daughters or...
MM: Oh, they believed in it.
ER: I would think so.
MM: xn fact, they wanted all of us to do the best we could. Since my sister,
Ella, showed a preference for business college, they sent her there instead of to a regular college or university. She made a good record at the Efficiency Business College, finishing near the top of her class. Now, my brother took law at Berkeley after he graduated, and finished in the top seven in his class.
ER: Did you enjoy your year at library school in Berkeley?
MM: Yes, but since I had not had any library experience, not even in high school, I was not certain I had selected the right profession. The entire year I kept telling my professors, "If I don't enjoy being a librarian, I'll return to the university to take something else." Just before the Christmas vacation I asked Miss Coulter, one of my professors, to request permission for me to do practice work in the Los Angeles Public Library. For some reason she felt it was necessary to tell the administrators that I was a Negro, so they assigned me to Helen Hunt Jackson, a small branch in a mixed Negro-Jewish neighborhood. A larger branch, a short distance away, would have afforded me a better opportunity to do reference work, but it was my good fortune to get valuable personal instruction in administrative routines from Mrs. Hortense Mitchell, the branch librarian at Helen Hunt Jackson, which greatly outweighed that advantage. She took me to the branch librarians' book order meeting downtown, where I learned a great deal about book selection and ordering. Mrs. Mitchell proved to be a real friend. Her generous assistance﻿18
MM: (cont) stood me in good stead during my second semester at Berkeley, since it made all my subjects more interesting and meaningful.
ER: Was Mrs. Mitchell black or Jewish?
MM: Neither. She was Caucasian. At that time there were no black professional librarians. However, there were two black clerk typists in the Los Angeles Public Library, Olive B. Minter and Etheline Clark. The latter had a flair for telling stories to children, and they were attracted to her. Even though she had no professional training, they permitted Mrs. Clark to act as a children's librarian for a short period.
ER:
ER;
MM: ER: MM:
That's interesting. Do you have anything to add about your library science courses at Berkeley?
MM: The second semester no classes were assigned on Tuesdays, to permit all the students to do practice work in the libraries of their choice. I worked in the reference and order departments of the University of California Library, since I had had experience in a public library. During our year at Berkeley, we were taught the basic principles of library science to prepare us for work in any type of library. Naturally some training on the job would be necessary until the routines of a particular institution were mastered.
The faculty advised us when representatives of various institutions were coming to interview prospective employees near the end of the year. I signed up to be interviewed by an individual from the University of California at Los Angeles, and another from the Standard Oil Company. The interviews were very perfunctory. It was evident from their questions that they did not have the slightest interest in me.
After graduation the first week in May, 1927, the family spent a few days in Yosemite National Park before returning to Los Angeles. I received a certificate in librarianship from the University of California, whereas other institutions were conferring a bachelor of science degree for the same curriculum. Gf course they were of equal rank. My brother, Charles, received his A.B. degree at the same commencement exercises.
Your parents must have been proud, having two of you graduate at the same time.
Yes they were very proud.
What did you do after you returned to Los Angeles?
Within a few days, I went downtown to the Central Library to see Miss Althea Warren, the assistant city librarian. I had met her when I was doing practice work at the Helen Hunt Jackson branch during the Christmas holidays. She was very cordial and spent almost an hour with me, introducing me to all the departments on the third floor and explaining many things about the library. Just as I was leaving she gave me a postcard to address, so they could notify me as soon as the announcements for the library examination were issued. She told me that this examination was given every year in the month of June. A day or two later, Dr. John Outlaw, our family physician, phoned just as I﻿19
MM: (cont) was leaving the house to spend the day downtown shopping. He asked my mother if I planned to take the Civil Service examination for librarian. She told him I was, but that the examination would not be given until June. He replied, "I'm reading my morning paper and today is the last day to file for the examination." I hurried down to the Civil Service office, secured an application blank and filled it out there, looking up addresses of references in the telephone directory.
ER: What month was this?
MM: May. The examination was always given in May, so they lied to me. Students in the June class of the library school at the public library were always permitted to take the Civil Service examination a month before graduation, with the understanding that they could not be appointed until after they had received their diplomas. If Dr. Outlaw had phoned five minutes later, my mother would have not have been able to reach me until I returned home from town, after the Civil Service office had closed for the day. This would have meant waiting a whole year to take the examination. Perhaps it was a good thing they did not know I had filed for the examination, because then they might have alerted the person on the oral board to give me a low grade.
ER: When was the written examination given for the position of librarian?
MM: It was given one week after I filed my application. Having just graduated from library school, some parts of the examination were easy for me while others were not. When I received a notice from Civil Service to report for my oral examination, then I knew that I had passed the written, since that was a requirement for taking the oral. When I reported for my oral interview, several candidates were waiting in the outer office. Those I talked with said they were nervous.
When I was called into the inner office, the interviewer said, "You're not afraid of me, are you?" I replied, "No, should I be?" She smiled and said, "Most of the others have come in trembling." After several questions on other topics, she asked me what I thought of the written examination. I told her I thought it was not well balanced nor completely fair. It did not seem reasonable to me to give equal credit for all ten questions, when those on the most important topics such as cataloging, classification, the "classics" and so forth were each several pages long, whereas two questions involved only one author. Unfortunately, I had not read anything by Stewart Edward White, a western writer, nor had I consulted the latest volume of The Ten Best Plays of the Year, as selected by Burns Mantle. Apparently, these two authors were were~stressed in the library school at the Los Angeles Public Library. The interviewer asked me what I did about those two questions. When I told her I gave a substitute answer for both, she said reasonable answers would give me fifty-percent credit for each question. I was greatly relieved.
I'm certain you were. How soon did you receive your grade from the Civil Service examination?
Not for several months. In the meantime, I visited Mrs. Mitchell at the Helen Hunt Jackson branch. She told me to go downtown and talk to Miss﻿20
MM: (cont) Kennedy, the second assistant city librarian, to apply for summer work as a substitute, since permanent appointments were always made on October first. When I noticed a Berkeley classmate who lived in San Francisco working in the Central Library History Department, I wondered why Miss Warren had not told me about summer substitute work earlier.
ER: They definitely were giving you the brush-off.
MM: The minute I walked into Miss- Kennedy's office she said, "We see you have taken the Civil Service examination." Under my breath I said, "No thanks to you," because it was evident they wanted me to miss it. She told me that they had to appoint the twenty-six graduates of their library school first. I replied, "I understood this was a city Civil Service examination, and I expect to be appointed where I appear on the list. Even though I attended college in Berkeley I am still a resident of Los Angeles." She countered this statement by asking me why I did not go South to do some pioneer work for my people. I answered, "If I wished to do some pioneer work for my people, I , mid need ,oae experience first, and I can think of no better place to get it than right here at home." Since the list had not been released yet, she asked me what I would do in the event my grade on the examination was not high enough for one of the available eighteen vacancies. When I indicated I would return to Berkeley to earn my master of arts degree in library science (it took two years of graduate study in those days for an M.A. in this field), she immediately sent me out to do substitute work. No one in the entire public library, including the city librarian, had a master's degree at that time.
ER: I imagine she didn't want a black librarian to have more education than anyone in the entire library system.
MM: I'm sure she didn't. My first assignment was for four weeks at the Jefferson branch substituting for the branch librarian, Miss Helen Spotts. She, too, became a good friend, and gave me a good recommendation after I spent eight weeks at her branch. This branch was located west of Arlington on Jefferson in a white neighborhood, but was only a couple of miles west of a small section of Negro residences. However, the Negroes rarely traveled west of Western Avenue at that time, and therefore did not patronize the Jefferson branch. Usually they would stop at the university branch on their way to town or the Central Library if they needed something special from its large collection.
You served as a substitute librarian at the Jefferson branch for four weeks, and then what transpired?
ttM: After spending four weeks at Jefferson, I went to the Vermont Square branch for two weeks before returning to Jefferson for four more weeks. At the branch librarian's request, I wrote book reviews for the Negro press, to encourage the black population in the West Jefferson district to use the Jefferson branch. Miss Spotts said one of her patrons told her he did not want her advertising in the "nigger" papers.
Oh, terrific.﻿21
MM: The Vermont Square branch was extremely large and busy.. It was located
in a park at 1201 West 48th Street. On Monday and Tuesday evenings people were lined up around the block, waiting to return their books and select new ones. The circulation at this branch was so large that the entire staff, including the professionals, had to pitch in in the mornings to help file and count the book checks. Vermont Square was an interesting contrast to Jefferson, which was a medium-sized branch. There were no minority groups using Vermont Square in those days. I was told immediately not to expect the children's librarian at Vermont Square to go to lunch with me, because she did not go to lunch with anyone, not even Mrs. Cavanaugh, the branch librarian. The staff felt her aloofness was due to being personally acquainted with the city librarian and having taken a trip to Europe. Imagine my surprise when the children's librarian invited me to go to lunch with her several times during my two-week stay at Vermont Square. No doubt the other staff members were equally surprised, even though they did not tell me so.
ER: Right.
MM: One evening I was attending a concert at the Philharmonic Auditorium with
a young man who was very dark. When the lights were turned up for the first intermission, someone tapped me on the shoulder. I looked around and saw it was the children's librarian from Vermont Square. We introduced our escorts and chatted cordially during both intermissions. When I told my mother that she easily could have ignored me, since I probably would not have looked around, my mother said evidently color was not important to her, and she probably liked me for qualities she did not find in the white staff members.
ER: It could very well have been.
MM: I enjoyed my ten weeks of substitute work at both branches. The staffs and public were very pleasant, and I got along well with both. Miss Spotts of the Jefferson branch told me that Sidney Mitchell, director of the School of Librarianship in Berkeley, had written to Everett R. Perry, the city librarian in Los Angeles, to ask him if he would employ me if I took the course in library science. Apparently he answered in the affirmative, but if he had not, I wonder if Mr. Mitchell would have written to other libraries to pose the same question. Doesn't it seem odd that a public institution, like the University of California, would have to be concerned about whether or not a Negro could secure employment, before permitting that person to take a particular course?
It's sickening.
MM: On October the first I received a permanent appointment as assistant to Miss Reba Dwight, the branch librarian at the Robert Louis Stevenson branch. It was located on the corner of Spence and Percy in the northeast section of the city, and served a largely middle-class white "Anglo" population. A small pocket of Mexicans lived in a section near the city limits. The adults spoke very little English and seldom visited the library, but the children were brought periodically with their school classes. Among our best patrons were a retired physician and his wife who were members of several literary societies, and a young Episcopal priest. These three and several others would not let anyone but me wait on them. If I happened to be working in the office when﻿22
MM: (cont) they arrived, they would ask the attendant at the circulation desk to ring for me. Miss Dwight felt I was very capable and gave me every encouragement. Once when she was ill for a short time, some of her branch librarian friends offered to help, thinking I was too young and inexperienced. She told them, "I don't need to worry with Miriam there." Even after we retired, we continued to invite one another to social affairs at our homes.
When I had been at Robert Louis Stevenson only a week, I discovered there was a discipline problem with a group of boys from the local high school. Every evening that the branch librarian or the children's librarian worked, they had to call the police. On the nights that I was in charge I managed without calling the police. When the boys were a bit too noisy I would smile and say, "If you can't keep quiet boys, there's the door!" One night as we were leaving one of the boys said, "Do you know why we are not bad on the nights you work, Miss Matthews?" I replied, "No, why?" He said, "Because you don't get mad at us."
SR • TtI ,1 f ' s T " Ar «pt t i nc
^M: The physician I referred to earlier went downtown to the Central Library one
day to see the assistant city librarian. He told her I was too fine a librarian to be working under someone and should have a branch of my own. This may or may not have prompted them to transfer me to the Helen Hunt Jackson branch as librarian in charge, after only two years at the Robert Louis Stevenson branch. After my appointment had been announced, but before I actually moved to Helen Hunt Jackson, a committee of Negroes visited the city librarian to criticize me, saying I was too "high hat" and would not be a good person for the position.
I can't believe it!
MM:
ER: MM:
Nevertheless, on September 1, 1929, I began my new duties with only a ten-dollar raise in salary, and was promised a substantial increase at the end of a year if I proved successful. The assistant city librarian attended the first meeting of a library book club I organized. The large crowd overflowed from the auditorium into the children's room and vigorously applauded the two prominent citizens who reviewed books that evening. After receiving a report from Miss Warren, Mr. Perry, the city librarian, wrote me a letter complimenting me on its success and asked for an invitation to the next meeting. I maintained this book club, at a high level during the five years I spent at Helen Hunt Jackson. Miss Helen E. Haines, an outstanding lecturer and book reviewer from the Central Library, asked to be scheduled at Helen Hunt Jackson once a year, and refused to go to some branches because they could not attract a large audience. I had a good relationship with my library patrons, both white and black, and Helen Hunt Jackson had the largest circulation in its history during my years of service there.
Wonderful!
After my third year at Helen Hunt Jackson, I was asked to transfer to the Vernon branch as first assistant to Miss Holmes who was the branch librarian there. They gave as their reason a need to close the Helen Hunt Jackson branch, but what they really wanted was for me to bolster up Miss Holmes, whose book reviews were not comparable to mine, and in other ways did not meet my standard﻿23
MM: (cont) of performance., I told the assistant city librarian that I would go to any hranch in Los Angeles except Vernon, since the two branches served many of the same patrons., and they considered me on the same level as Miss Holmes. We alternated in writing book reviews for the newspapers, giving talks at Jefferson High School to adult education and remedial reading classes, compiling book lists and so forth. The branch in West Los Angeles had just increased enough in size to add a third librarian to its staff, and Miss Abell, the branch librarian, said she would be delighted to have me. But they were not about to send me there. Since I would not transfer to Vernon branch, I stayed on at the Helen Hunt Jackson branch which, incidentally, was not closed for twenty years. Although the administrators indicated they were pleased with my work at Helen Hunt Jackson, I did not get a single raise in five years, even though I had not reached the maximum grade of librarian and was working out of class. The excuse they gave was the depression, which caused them to cancel all automatic salary increases.
Incredible.
MM: Late in 1933, Miss Holmes at Vernon branch became seriously ill. Alice Melcon, her first assistant librarian, was acting branch librarian about nine months before she died. After he heard the news of her death, Dr. John Diaz, a Negro doctor, went to see the assistant city librarian. He told her I should be appointed branch librarian at Vernon. As a patron of both branches, he felt I was greatly superior to Miss Holmes. When they called me to tell me they were considering me for this position, they still wanted me to be acting branch librarian for a year. In those days anyone appointed head of a branch or department was exempted from Civil Service. I was told if I did not prove successful at this larger branch, I could be terminated and have no job, so this would be a protection for me. Moreover, they indicated all new promotions would be "acting" for one year. After reading the Civil Service rules, I went back to the assistant city librarian and told her that should an employee be dismissed from an "exempt" position, then he or she would automatically revert to his previous rating under Civil Service. Moreover, I felt five years as acting head of Helen Hunt Jackson branch should be adequate proof of my ability. She responded curtly, "I only told you we were considering you; you don't have the appointment yet."
ER: Oh my!
When the Board of Library Commissioners approved my appointment at a Friday meeting, the assistant city librarian did not phone me right away. In the meantime, practically everyone at the Central Library knew about the new appointments, there were several others, before I did.

That you'd gotten the...
That I had been appointed to head the Vernon branch, effective October 1, 1934, As branch librarian? As branch librarian.
Receiving the pay of branch librarian?﻿24
ER: MM:
MM: Yes. The staff was all white except a half-time clerk typist and a half-time page who shelved books. Mrs. Melcon, who had been acting branch librarian for almost a year and was older then I was, might have resented me but she didn't-She introduced me to all the best patrons, telling them I was the new branch librarian. If she had not done this, most of them would have assumed that she was the branch librarian, and I her first assistant librarian, Mrs. Melcon's husband was an engineer who worked out of town and only came home on weekends. He told her, "Please tell your Miss Matthews that for the first time in years you ase fit to live with and I am grateful to her." Apparently, Miss Holmes had kept the whole staff in turmoil most of the time, so Alice Melcon talked to her husband about library problems every weekend. My children's librarian, Kay Grosse, had transferred from a branch in a more privileged area, because she thought the children at Vernon would be more responsive. The children at her previous branch were so sophisticated, she felt she was not needed. One day she offered to find a good book for a young boy to substitute for The Count of Monte Cristo by Dumas which he had selected. He said, "I have perused it and find w» wrd which Is incomprehensible to me." So she let bin have the book.
Of course.
My appointment to the Vernon branch had been announced in the newspapers about a month before I went there. My first day at the branch I received many flowers and telegrams from friends and former colleagues. That afternoon a teacher walked in, saw all the flowers and asked, "What's going on?" I replied, "It's a welcome to me on my first day here as branch librarian." She said, "Humm." Didn't even congratulate me.
One of the teachers?
Yes, a Negro teacher who was a member of my sorority and supposedly a friend. It's amazing sometimes how people act.
I know the type.
This was not the attitude only of one individual. No formal recognition was received from my sorority, even though I was the only member in Los Angeles who dated back to the early days, who had never been unfinancial or inactive. I was a charter member of the first chapter organized in Los Angeles, past president of two chapters, including the graduate chapter which I established in 1929, and the second western regional director. After my appointment to the Vernon branch had been announced, they gave a luncheon for a new graduate of the University of Southern California, who had won a scholarship to Bryn Mavr, without including me as an honoree.
How strange!
In addition to warm messages from close personal and library friends, I received congratulatory letters from two public figures, the executive directors °f the Los Angeles Urban League and the 28th Street YMCA. However, a large citywide organization, with jobs for Negroes as one of its major goals, sat on its hands while Dr. John Diaz, a library patron with no organization behind him, impressed the library administrators with his personal plea for wy appointment as branch librarian of the Vernon branch. After I was trans-

(cont) ferred to Vernon, members of the aforementioned organization rushed down to the central library to request a part-time Civil Service page job for a college student, at Vernon. She was permitted to do clerical work instead of shelving books. Later she requested promotion to the grade of clerk typist. Before a final decision was made by the administrators, this organization published a story in the Negro press accusing the city librarian of prejudice. The employee was appointed as a clerk typist, but after she graduated from college was denied a recommendation to attend library school. Unable to receive professional training, she had to settle for a teaching position.
Some people are shortsighted.
When I arrived at Vernon branch it had a book stock of 24,000 volumes, an annual circulation of 184,000 and a staff of three full-time professional librarians and six clericals, some of them part-time. This large branch, housed in a two-story brick Carnegie building on the corner of 45th and
Central Avenue, v.as .1 great challenge to me. I plunged into my work with^ great enthusiasm, making numerous community contacts both inside and outside the library. According to a survey made in 1934, about thirty-five percent of patrons registered at Vernon were Negroes.
Monthly meetings of the Vernon Library Book Club began in October, with the largest crowds that first year coming to hear Arna Bontemps speak on two occasions about some of his writings. In May, 1935, a little theatre group was organized at the branch at the suggestion of Mr. Bontemps, who acted as a counselor for the young people who signed up for this project.
African masks made by sculptor Beulah foodard, one of our patrons, were exhibited first at the Vernon branch and then at the Central Library. In October, 1935, when the Los Angeles County Museum presented Mrs. Woodard's masks in a one-man show (a first for a Negro), the metropolitan newspapers did feature stories on the exhibition, accompanied by large illustrations. During the years that followed, both black and white artists exhibited their work at the Vernon branch. William Henry Payne, a collector of rare books on the Negro, permitted us to show some of his collection in our glass display case from time to time.
These activities sound fascinating.
Important contacts were made through the schools, and the organizations associated with the South Central Community Coordinating Council, which brought a number of groups to the library to use our book collection and our two auditoriums. One year the total use of these auditorium facilities was 335. There were classes in family relations, French, Spanish and dramatics, Girl Reserve groups from the YWCA, garden clubs, children's story hours, puppet shows and many others.
Due to a growing interest in the Negro and race relations, I made a special effort to build up the collection on Negro history and literature. While in New York in 1940, I acquired a file of the early volumes of the Journal £f Negro History, and shipped them to the Vernon branch as a gift. My personal file of newspaper and magazine clippings on the Negro were donated to Vernon, also, along with pictures and materials solicited from authors,﻿26
MM: (cont) artists, and newspaper editors. Former staff members told me they were proud of the knowledge they had acquired on Negro history at Vernon because they knew how to look up answers to questions on the subject from general reference sources when the branch had no specialized material on the Negro.
Jane Lovejoy, a clerk typist, transferred to Vernon at the suggestion of the children's librarian. She became an avid reader of Negro newspapers and magazines. At this time lynchings were occurring in the South, and Negroes generally were refused service at places of public accommodation, even in the North. After reading something in the newspaper which she considered shocking, Mrs. Lovejoy would show it to me and say, "Miss Matthews, is this really true?" I told her they could not print it if it were not true. She exclaimed, "I don't see how any Negro can be happy one single minute in America!" At parties and in casual conversations with friends, Jane Lovejoy passed on the knowledge she had gained at Vernon, and enlisted a few more friends for the cause. This experience taught me that many right-thinking white people	iidvt had no contact with Negroes are not aware of the immen-
sity of their problems in our democracy.
How true!

Since the Los Angeles Civil Service makes no provision for sabbatical leaves, and I wished a change of scene after six years at Vernon, I requested an exchange position with the New York Public Library for the year 1940. New York had no one they could send at the time, so I was permitted to take a six-month leave of absence without pay to work in the "Big City." Arriving in New York on the last day of 1939, I had one of the most thrilling experiences of my life, greeting the New Year in the midst of a milling, screaming throng of humanity at Times Square! I'll never forget it! On January 2, I reported to the main library on Fifth Avenue for an interview with Mr. Hopper, the director of the New York Public Library. He assigned me to the 135th Street Branch, where I spent most of my time until the last month when I was transferred to the 145th Street Branch. On several occasions I spent a day or two downtown in the order department and the readers' advisory department. They were interested in some of our routines in Los Angeles, especially our method of handling rental books. Information I brought back with me proved valuable to the Los Angeles Public Library. During my six months in New York I had a busy social life, going to parties, receptions, nightclubs and the opera. I attended practically every play on Broadway and visited most of the museums and historic sites. On weekend trips to Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C., I engaged in similar activities. On the trip back to Los Angeles, I stopped in Pensacola, Florida, to see the house where I was born; visited an aunt in Mobile, Alabama; and took a tour of the fabulous city of New Orleans. All in all, it was an exciting and rewarding six months!
It must have been most exciting and rewarding.
What a letdown to learn when I returned home that the 1940-41 budget for the Los Angeles Public Library had been cut drastically. In addition to other items adopted to help make ends meet, the library administration decided to schedule certain branches Monday, Wednesday, and Friday only, and assign two branches to each of six branch librarians. Since all branch librarians and﻿27
MM: (cont) department heads who had been "exempt" Civil Service were blanketed
in under Civil Service in 1937, when the voters approved an amendment to the city charter, only those appointed after 1937, or who had had a leave of absence since that date were placed on the layoff list. Mine was the sixth name on that list. When I questioned the city librarian about my name being on the list, she said, "I was suprised, too. When I phoned the Civil Service office about it, they said that was the way they were doing it." If she had already phoned the office, I felt certain she would not have repeated the call just for my benefit. At any rate, they told her to refer the matter to the city attorney's office for a ruling, and in her letter to explain my particular situation. At that time, my brother was a deputy in the L.A. County District Attorney's office. He went to see the deputy city attorney who was handling the case, and learned that Miss Warren had not told them why I took a leave of absence to go to New York, which was an important point.
Not content to just wait for the city attorney's decision, I went to see Mrs. Ann Leidendecker, our library representative on the board of the Los Angeles Employees Association. She tola me to phone the Association's attorney for advice. I learned from him that no matter how the city attorney ruled, I would have to have the Civil Service Commission restore my credit for the time I was on leave of absence. He told me to write a letter to the Civil Service Commission explaining my plight, and to get it signed by the city librarian before posting it. The Association attorney showed the carbon copy of the letter which I sent him to the president of the Civil Service Commission. He said my request would be approved without question as long as the city attorney ruled in my favor. A favorable ruling was announced just a few days before October and Mrs. Leidendecker notified me to get my letter in to the Civil Service Commission. When I told her one of my clerks had delivered the letter to Miss Warren weeks ago for her to sign and mail it, she still urged me to go see Miss Warren. I said, "You know she is going to say she mailed it." The minute I walked into her office, she told me the attorney for the All City Employees Association had phoned her to get the letter in right away, and she said it had been mailed already. After I returned to Mrs. Leidendecker's office, she suggested I phone the secretary of the Civil Service Commission at City Hall to see if the letter had arrived at the last moment. Her reply was in the negative, but she did mention the possibility of its having been delivered to the wrong department where someone was on vacation, and therefore had not been referred to the proper department. This gave me an idea. I went back to Vernon branch, had a duplicate of the letter typed and then drove back to the Central Library without giving the city librarian advance notice. I walked into her office, handed her the letter, and told her the Civil Service Commission secretary had telephoned me to get another copy of the letter signed by her, and then to bring it to her at City Hall right away. I explained to her that the original letter probably had been delivered to the wrong department and was sitting on the desk of someone on vacation. Her hands were shaking and she turned every color of the rainbow. She pretended to be re-reading the letter in order to compose herself. Finally she signed the letter and I delivered it to the City Hall. When the Civil Service Commission met the next morning, my credits were restored, and everything was arranged to my satisfaction.
The changes that were being made in the Los Angeles Public Library due to the budget cuts involved wholesale transfers and some layoffs. Two weeks earlier Miss Warren had assigned me to the teachers' department at the Central Library.﻿28
MM: (cont) She told me no matter how the city attorney ruled, I would have to
work in the teachers' department three months until a branch librarian retired, because they could not make so many transfers at the last moment. If the city attorney ruled in my favor, then I would be paid a branch librarian's salary while working as a librarian in that department. I was provoked because the head of the teachers' department had assigned me to work eight hours every Saturday, while she was not working any Saturdays, even though that was the busiest day of the week in that department. Friends were giving parties in my honor every Saturday in October to welcome me home from New York. I told Miss Warren that if the city attorney did rule in my favor, and she insisted on sending me to the teachers' department, then I would have to ask for some of my Saturdays off. She said, "You must remember you are working for a living, and you will do as you are told." I replied, "Under normal circumstances I would expect to do that, but I do not feel I should be penalized for something that is not my fault."
ER: Good for you! Ttfhat happened next?
MM: On September 30th, Miss Roberta Bowler, the assistant city librarian, phoned
to tell me that effective October the first, I was assigned as branch librarian of the Vernon and Watts branches. I received my telephone call about four o'clock while Miss Dwight, my former boss at the Robert Louis Stevenson branch, who was not expecting to be transferred, received a call just as she was walking out the front door at 5:35 p.m. She was asked to clear out her desk and report to the Central Library the next day. For the next three months she was doing mainly clerical work in the extension department. I would have protested had I been in her place, since she was a competent, experienced branch librarian.
Well, I guess she felt it was only for a short time.
MM: Although I was very pleased not to have been transferred to the teachers' department, I soon discovered that taking charge of two branch libraries was far from easy, especially since I was given four "green" children's librarians to train at the Vernon branch the very first year. Both Vernon and Watts were open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from one to nine o'clock. Can you imagine what it was like to have new children's librarians in charge of these branches half time, who often depended upon the messenger clerks to explain the circulation rules when I was away? Instead of phoning me when they could not take care of a patron's needs, they would leave me a note. Then I would have to phone or write the patron to take care of the matter using a great deal of valuable time. After two years in charge of Vernon and Watts under trying circumstances, I began to tire of doing double duty and started asking for a transfer. I mentioned it verbally and in my written reports with no results.
It must have been dreadfully discouraging.
It was. About this time Miss Ernestine Rose, who was white, and had been branch librarian of the 135th Street Branch of the New York Library for a number of years, decided to retire. They wished to replace her with a Negro librarian and sent inquiries throughout the country. I was one of the leading candidates for this position and might have been appointed if a Community Citizens Committee had not insisted upon the appointment of a New Yorker. The﻿29
MM: (cont) salary was only slightly higher than mine in Los Angeles, but the
staff was almost three times larger than a Los Angeles Public Library branch with comparable circulation and reference work. However, the New York branch had three floors, which required more staff than the compact one-floor Los Angeles branch. Mr. Hopper, the director of the New York Public Library, wrote to Miss Warren to tell her of their decision, and mentioned how impressed they were with my background and recommendations from leading community figures. He said, "Your Miss Matthews must be a great ball of fire! Please let her know we would have liked having her on our staff." After she finished reading the letter to me on the telephone Miss. Warren asked, "Aren't you disappointed, Miss Matthews?" I replied, "No. I'll be available when a bigger chance comes along."
ER: Good for you.
MM: In the spring of 1944, when I had almost decided to ask for a leave of absence to study for my master's degree at the University of Chicago, the library administrators decided that all branch librarians, who had been in one branch ten years or more, nad to be transferred to prevent them from getting in a rut. They insisted on transferring older branch librarians who had bought homes in their branch neighborhoods and were within a year or two of retirement, yet they said nothing to me when I had been begging for a transfer for some time.
ER: Incredible!
MM: When I asked Miss Bowler, the assistant city librarian, why I had not been contacted about a transfer, she replied, "I guess you'll just have to face it, Miss Matthews." "Face what?" I asked. "Color," she responded. I told her I did not think there was anything to face, since I had the same education, spoke the same language and therefore could work in one part of the city as well as another. As an example, I mentioned my brother who was working in the district attorney's office and went into the courtroom every day to try people for their lives, yet he was usually the only Negro present. I said, "Surely people's lives are more important than doing reference work and handing out books!" Miss Bowler commented, "That's very unusual." I replied, "No, it's not unusual. I know a number of people all across the country who have positions of authority supervising whites and there's no problem." She said, "The mere fact you can point it out makes it unusual." I said, "No. Although a number have had their stories told in newspapers and magazines, those I know personally have had no publicity, and the number of such individuals is much greater than you might suspect." After I left, Miss Bowler repeated our conversation to Miss Warren, the city librarian. A few days later Miss Warren came out to the Vernon branch to see me. Her very first words were, "I understand from Miss Bowler that you think we are not treating you right." I said, "Yes, that's true." She continued, "After you return from the University of Chicago with your Ph.D., we will find a spot for you in the social sciences department to take care of the Negro collection." Of course she was being sarcastic, because even with a master's degree I could not earn a Ph.D. degree in one year. Moreover, she wanted me to know she was not planning to promote me, no matter how many degrees I acquired. She knew I was taking university courses while I was working, because Miss Bowler, who succeeded Mrs. Betsy Foye Veazey as assistant city librarian, was in my class on public administration. However, Miss Bowler was trying to earn her A.B. degree. Mrs. Veazey died suddenly while I was in New York. It surprised me to have one of the Central Library departments heads say how sorry she was that I﻿30
MM- (cont) was not in Los Angeles when the Civil Service examination for the assistant city librarian's position was given. I wonder if she was naive enough to think the administration would consider me for the post at that time even if I passed high on the list.
ER: What did you say to Miss Warren when she spoke of putting you in the social science department after you earned a Ph.D.?
MM:
ER:

ER: MM:
I indicated that I would not be interested in the social sciences department, except as the department librarian or the assistant department librarian. I already held the Civil Service rating for the latter position. Since she had brought up the subject of a Negro collection, I told her what a difficult time I was having answering research questions on the Negro from all over southern California and even from out of state, in addition to managing two branch libraries with untrained personnel. She said, The Central Library is the research center, and you must refer all such questions there. I told Miss Warren that I asked every patron requesting special information on the Negro it he nad been to the Central Library, and always received the same answer, "Oh yes, they referred me to you!" It gave me extreme pleasure to remind Miss Warren that the previous month she had received a letter from the war department, requesting pictures and historical data on notable Negroes and events, to be used for murals in the recreation hall at March Field m San Bernardino. She referred the letter to the Central Library art department and they found only two pictures. Finally she sent the letter to me just two days before the deadline the war department had given her, and I had to spend my free Saturday working overtime to get the material in the mail on time. She didn't know what to say.
She should have felt very foolish.
During the entire conversation she used a placating tone of voice, yet never suggested relieving me of the two branches and transferring me to a single west side branch. If I had not decided already to file an official request with the Civil Service department for a year's leave of absence to attend the University of Chicago, this incident would have convinced me it was the only thing to do. My mind was fully made up to specialize in another library field and not return to the Los Angeles Public Library.
I know how frustrated you must have felt—how sick and tired of battling with all that prejudice!
Indeed I was. All summer long I worked like a demon to get the Vernon and Watts branches into tip-top shape before leaving for the University of Chicago. I even used a week of my vacation to help achieve this goal. During the year before my departure, my job at Vernon was complicated by the absence of my experienced and highly competent half-time clerk typist who was on maternity leave. This was a big job even for an experienced clerk typist working only twenty hours a week, yet I was given two quarter-, time messenger clerks (college students) to train for the job. They came to work after school when we had a rush of patrons, and they could not complete the overdues because the registration files were at the front of the desk where they were constantly interrupted by the public, aside from being inexperienced. Moreover, a growing number of transients in the community caused overdues to increase tremendously. When patrons did not respond to﻿31
(cont) the first or second overdue notices, I would stop by their homes on my way to and from work in an effort to pick up the books before they moved, taking our books with them.
ER: You really had your work cut out for you.
Indeed I did. Watts branch was- finally in perfect shape and Vernon branch, too, except for a big file of overdues and a number of pamphlets which had to be filed. For several years, due to a shortage of funds, all the branches in the city were closed the last two weeks in August to allow all the employees, except those at Central Library, to take their vacations at the same time. Since new employees or those returning from leaves of absence were not entitled to vacation, they were used as substitutes for some of the Central Library staff, because it was the only unit open to the public for that two-week period. I asked Miss Warren to permit my clerk typist, who was just returning from maternity leave, to work that two-week period at Vernon branch to clear up che overdues. "Oh no," she replied, "she will be needed to substitute at Central Library." However, she was not needed, and they forced her to take the two weeks off without pay!

How astounding!
When I arrived at the Graduate Library School of the University of Chicago to register late in September, 1944, I was interviewed by Dean Carleton Joeckel, who had been one of my professors at the School of Librarianship in Berkeley seventeen years earlier. In order to plan my courses he asked me what I wanted to do. When I told him "special" library work, he asked what kind. Thinking I would have a better chance to secure a position in a large institution, I mentioned the Library of Congress, When he told me he knew the Library of Congress personnel director, and was almost certain he would not employ me because of my race, I was astonished. "Apparently you do not know," I replied, "that a Negro librarian has been the representative of the Library of Congress at the British Museum for twenty-five years. Her apartment building was bombed during the war, and she is back at the Library of Congress until it is safe to return to London. On a visit to the Library of Congress in 1930, I met a Negro in the catalog department, who is a specialist in Oriental languages. However, this is not important. A person should be employed because of his ability, not his color, especially in a tax-supported institution." He acknowledged his ignorance of the two individuals I had mentioned. Then he advised me to take my master's degree in Spanish, since the Library of Congress preferred subject specialists to individuals with advanced degrees in library science. Spanish was out of the question because I was too rusty, having had no practice for a number of years. Dr. Joeckel then suggested that I teach at the Atlanta University library school. I told him I went into the library field because I did not wish to teach. He indicated that teaching something I had practiced for seventeen years was quite different from ordinary teaching. I said, "My parents made a great sacrifice to move to California so their children would not grow up in the segregated South, so I would be doing them a great disservice to return South to work." He replied, They need people like you to help bring up the level of the Negro population in the South so they will be ready for integration." I answered, "What about the 'Okies' and 'Arkies'? What about the Kentucky hillbillies? Are they ready? You begin integrating people at the level where they are. And I still﻿32
(cont) do not wish to go South!" Right. Good for you.
MM: Dr. Joeckel finally arranged for me to take three general courses the first quarter, to give me time to decide on my specialty. As I recall, they were principles of administration, methods of research and library administration. Later, I took three courses in the public library field, two courses in sociology and one course in social statistics. We were permitted to take several courses outside the Graduate Library School. My year at Chicago was both stimulating and rewarding. "Library Activities in the Field of Race Relations" was the title of my thesis. The following ethnic and religious minorities were included: Negroes, Mexican-Americans, Jews, Indians and all types of Orientals. There were two Jewish professors on the staff, Dr. Leon Carnovsky and Dr. Lowell Martin, who appeared to be completely unaware of the similarity between the problems of the Negro and the Jew. During my second quarter at the Univers Ltv of Chicago T aud 3 seminar on Gunnar Myrdal's American Dilemma, a huge two-volume work, summarizing an exhaustive four-year survey of the Negro in America. This study, published in 1944, maintained that the problem of the Negro in the United States was inextricably involved with the democratic functioning of American society. During a class discussion in a course on the library and the community, I mentioned several facts from Myrdal's study. Dr. Martin, the professor, was intrigued by these statements, and gave me a whole hour the following week to review the book for the class. Later I learned he had called it to the attention of Dr. Carnovsky, who was the counselor for my thesis.
During my oral comprehensive examination conducted by the entire Library School faculty, Dr. Carnovsky asked what book I would recommend for an individual who knew very little about the Negro. When I mentioned one of Carter G. Woodson's simpler books on Negro history, he said he thought I would say the American Dilemma. I replied, "I wouldn't give an advanced sociological study to a beginner." Another professor asked me if I objected to "Little Black Sambo", since he heard it had been criticized by a number of Negroes. I said, "I would not object to it printed in its original form as an East Indian folk tale, but certain American publishers by changing the illustrations had made it look like a caricature of the American Negro." Apparently he had read it to his small son and found it charming. Then he asked if I would object if it was called "Little White Sambo." I said, "No, the majority group does not have to worry about stereotypes, only minorities."
An Irish professor reminded them that the Irish had been a despised minority group, too, when the potato famine in Ireland in the mid-nineteenth century drove'them to our shores. They were the poorest of the poor and had a hard time finding a decent job.
No grades were given for the oral comprehensive examination. The candidate was either passed or rejected. I was passed.
Good for you. What happened next?
I neglected to say that the written comprehensive examination was given before﻿33
MM: (cont) the oral. After the oral I was ready to return home. Shortly before the end of the year everyone in the Graduate Library School was asked to fill out a form, listing the type of position or positions desired, also the salary and location. On my form 1 indicated I would go anywhere in the world except the southern United States. And what did they offer me when I was ready to leave? The library school at Atlanta University! I said, "I told you in the beginning..." and was interrupted by Dr. Carnovsky, who was in charge of student placement, "Well, you ruled out almost everything." "Is the South almost everything?" I replied. "You have been asking students from the first year class to go to Europe, and they have refused because they were not interested. I am interested and you are still not offering it to me." Possibly most of their job listings might have indicated Negroes were not wanted. If so, they should have told me, so I would not think they were prejudiced. Moreover, they should have tried to persuade some of the institutions to appoint a qualified Negro.
I should say so.
Since he was my counselor, Dr. Carnovsky should have remembered some of the statements from my thesis, especially the following: "One of the most effective race relations techniques consists in teaching individuals belonging to different racial and cultural groups to work together. Respect for others grows through personal contact, making special discussions of race and culture unnecessary. Personnel practices of public libraries as well as those of other institutions should make provision for staff appointments and promotions without regard to race, color, or creed. Civil Service records and the employment application should contain no reference to the applicant's origin. Assignments should be made also without regard to the race of the persons who are to be served, or with whom the applicant will have business or professional contact. Such a policy would contribute much to any program fostering better racial and cultural relations."
The questionnaire I sent to fifty libraries throughout the country, to secure information on their activities to promote racial and cultural understanding, included a suggested list of library activities conducive to this end. "Employment of minorities" was one of the items on this list, and Dr. Carnovsky asked me to omit it because it had to do with administration. I told him any type of library program or activity had to do with administration. "Moreover," I said, "if they can't practice it, they shouldn't preach it!"
That's right.
There was a position I could have secured on my own at a new race relations center in downtown Chicago, where they planned to set up a special library. Even though they needed an experienced person for this position, they were offering a beginner's salary for a first-year graduate. With a master's degree and seventeen years experience I wouldn't think of accepting it. That was why I decided to come back to Los Angeles, where I could live for less than in the East, and be with my family and friends.
Before I completed my year at the University of Chicago, I received a letter from Miss Bowler, the assistant city librarian in Los Angeles, asking me what﻿34
MM: (cont) my plans were. After I wrote her I planned to return to the Los
Angeles Public Library, I heard from Miss Warren, the city librarian. She said they would save a branch for me. Then she had the nerve to say that the branch housekeeping at Vernon was found to be very much in arrears after I left for Chicago. I was so angry I was burning up for a whole week. When I finally answered her letter, I did not mention her insult to me after all my hard work.
You had told her about the backlog of overdues before you went to Chicago.
MM: Yes. That's what made it so ridiculous. In our first conversation in her office after my return she brought it up again. I told her, "In the first place, a large number of transients in the Vernon community had greatly increased the volume of overdues; and in the second place, I was given untrained messenger clerks as substitutes for an excellent, experienced clerk typist, and children's librarians who were not equipped to be in charge of the branches half time when I ^ss away. Not only did I type some overdue notices (which was not my job), but I also delivered messenger notices, trying to get our books back before the patrons moved away. This was done on my own time and with no reimbursement for my gasoline. I could not have done anything more, unless I had four hands and forty-eight hours in every day!"
While I was away at the University of Chicago, Miss Warren wrote to a well-known foundation to request funds for a Negro... no, a library worker with Negro young people. They denied the request since they only gave scholarships. Even though the funds were denied, she had to tell me she planned the position for me. I told her, "It's a good thing you didn't get the money, Miss Warren, because you would have had to look for someone else to do the job. I studied library science to become a librarian, not a social worker."
Then she started telling me that the Washington Irving branch, where I was going, would not require a lot of community work. Another sarcastic dig. I told her all the community work I did at Vernon was to get the people to use the library and it, too, was done on my own time. Restrictive covenants had been signed by some of the people in the Washington Irving community, and she had to mention this, too, thinking it would make me apprehensive.^ Nothing was said about backing me up, if I had a problem with a rude, prejudiced patron. As in all the other branches where I had worked, I had no problem with the public. In fact a number of the patrons said they were glad my predecessor was gone because she was too tired to get off her seat to serve them. Others complimented me on the books I selected for the branch. Some students from Los Angeles High School told me they received the best grades in their class because of the up-to-date material on important subjects they found in our vertical file. A white friend of mine who used the branch wrote to Miss Warren, congratulating her on the appointment of such a gracious, efficient branch librarian. In her reply Miss Warren told her about my work with Negroes at Vernon and Watts which was entirely irrelevant. The director of the Children's Home Society, a large private adoption agency with headquarters in our district, told me she had used many libraries, but had never had better service than at Washington Irving. She, too, wrote Miss Warren telling her so. Although I enjoyed my work everywhere, otherwise I would not have worked so hard, I must say Washington Irving branch was a welcome change from Vernon and Watts, and ten times as easy.﻿35
ER: You deserved it.
MM-" Not long after I returned to Los Angeles from Chicago, I took the Civil Service examination for principal librarian in order to be eligible for the position of department librarian at the Central Library. Although I knew no one on the oral board, I received the highest grade on the oral part of the examination, an unusual achievement for a Negro taking any kind of Civil Service examination in those days. One of the examiners asked Mary Murdoch, head of the South Pasadena Public Library, if she knew me. She told her that we were friends. The examiner told Mary she was so bored that day interviewing candidates who thought just being on the job a certain number of years qualified them for promotion. When I came in for my interview in the middle of the afternoon, the examiner said I was like a breath of fresh air. "Here was someone," she said, "who was active in the community and in a professional organization, took leaves to work in New York and to earn a M.A. degree at the University of Chicago, and in every way showed she had initiative and ambition."
The only vacancy at that time was in the periodicals department, the least interesting of the Central Library departments. The Civil Service department certifies three candidates for each vacancy. When Miss Warren interviewed me, I told her I would accept the periodicals department, but would anticipate a transfer later to a more challenging department. She told me that would not be possible, indicating that if you were appointed to a particular department you stayed there. In a flash I named at least three department heads who had been transferred from one department to another. Miss Laughlin who received the appointment to the periodicals department was transferred later to the science department.

Did they expect any intelligent person would believe their lies?
Perhaps not, but I feel certain they did not expect to be challenged. Much to my surprise, I learned that white employees were imposed upon, too, and many of them did not say a word. The case of Miss Dwight doing clerical work for three months was a good example.
It seems incredible that white Civil Service employees would not feel free to protest when they had good cause.
After the library school which was attached to the Los Angeles Public Library finally closed during the depression, there was no school in the city for several years. When a library school was opened at the University of Southern California, Negro students were accepted, but all of them failed to pass the Civil Service examination for the Los Angeles Public Library, due to being given low scores on the oral examination. White students who ranked below them in their class work managed to get passing scores on the Civil Service examinations. Thus I was the only fully qualified black librarian in the Los Angeles Public Library system for almost twenty years. Shortly before she retired in 1947, Miss Warren appointed two Negro librarians who were graduates of the Atlanta University library school in Georgia.
After Miss Althea Warren retired, she appeared to be an entirely different type of person in regards to her racial attitudes. She joined the Eagle﻿36

ER: MM:
(cont) Rock Council for Civic Unity which sponsored a fundraising event every year to provide scholarships for minority students to attend Occidental, a small private college. One year they invited Langston Hughes to be their guest speaker. When the Occidental College trustees were told that Langston Hughes had written a poem in his youth which made him appear to favor atheism, they would not permit the council to present him in the college auditorium. Miss Warren telephoned me at my home, deploring this action and saying it was a shame. She was one of the leaders in the council who refused to rescind the invitation to Langston Hughes, so the meeting was held in a church. On other occasions she telephoned me to suggest national Negro figures for some of their programs, chatting at such length you would have thought we were old friends. This was an amazing contradiction! It would seem that shedding her official position as city librarian had set her free.
A sudden change like that is unbelievable!
Harold L. Hamill, who had placed first on the open competitive Civil Service list, was appointed to succeed Miss Warren. Since Mr. Hamill was born and reared in Washington, D.C., where there was segregation and worked in Baltimore and Kansas City where there was segregation, I was doubtful about my prospects for promotion under his administration. I first met him in June, 1947, at the annual convention of the American Library Association in San Francisco, where I was installed as a member of the A.L.A. Council. I did not have an adequate opportunity to size him up. At a workshop he chaired, he seemed especially interested in my comments on the attempt made by the Los Angeles Public Library to get the voters to amend the city charter to raise the library tax rate, which failed.
The Board of Library Commissioners announced Mr. Hamill's appointment as city librarian after the close of the American Library Association convention. Shortly after he took over the reins at the Los Angeles Public Library, he held a general staff assembly to get acquainted and announce some of his plans for the library. He said he believed in democracy, but that can mean almost anything.
That's right.
A thorough survey of the Los Angeles Public Library system was requested by Mr. Hamill, in order to learn what we had done in the past and to make appropriate plans for the future. Dr. Lowell Martin and Dr. Leon Carnovsky came out from the University of Chicago to conduct the survey, assisted by the entire staff. Both professors praised me to the administration and saw that I was put on some of the special survey committees.
While the survey was in progress, Mr. Hamill asked the central library department librarians and the branch librarians to vote for three persons in their respective groups they would like to represent them on administrative committees while he was learning about the Los Angeles Public Library system. He let it be known in advance that this balloting would be a partial guide— that the final decision would be his. Several branch librarians told me they put my name on their lists, and Mrs. Leidendecker, head of the science department, said she told Mr. Hamill I was the best branch librarian in the system. Nevertheless, I was surprised when Mr. Hamill selected me and Eleanora Crowder to represent the branch librarians. We were never called﻿37
MM: (cont) for the same meetings, and I served more frequently than Mrs. Crowder. In spite of this appointment and Mr. Hamill's friendly attitude, I started making arrangements at the University of Southern California to enter their law school, taking a few courses while working full time and then reducing my work schedule to half time. The day before I was to pay my tuition at University of Southern California, I was called to Central Library for an interview with Mr. Hamill, Miss Bowler, the assistant city librarian, and the personnel officer.
ER: What happened at the interview?
MM: i Was told they had divided the city into six regions, and were appointing six regional librarians to carry out their plans for a new regional system. This would give the branch libraries better supervision and relieve the assistant city librarian of an impossible task, trying to inspect more than sixty branches even once a year. Mr. Hamill, the city librarian, said, "Miss Matthews, would you be interested in this position?" I replied, "Yes, indeed." I was told I would be assigned to the South Central region with Vermont Square as my regional branch, and supervise twelve branch libraries. Since I was leaving on the weekend to attend the American Library Association midwinter meeting in Chicago, I was interviewed on Friday while the other five candidates were to be called in the following Monday. I was sworn to secrecy since they did not wish the news to get out ahead of time. While I was in Chicago, I received congratulatory telegrams from current and former staff members.
ER: MM:
ER: mm:
You must have been very excited.
Indeed I was. I immediately gave up my plans to attend law school, because I knew my new position as regional librarian would require all my time and energy. When I returned from Chicago, I learned the library employees throughout the system had been buzzing about all the appointments. A good friend told me that many of them said, "She's smart, but it won't work because of her color." My train from Chicago was delayed by a heavy snow storm, so I arrived at the Washington Irving branch on Monday at eight p.m. instead of noon. Mr. Hamill had left a message for me to phone him before reporting to the Vermont Square branch on Tuesday morning. He told me under normal circumstances he would not have mentioned this matter to me at all, but he felt it might be advisable for me to have this information so I could be prepared. While I was in Chicago, a committee of white citizens, including the local newspaper editor, called on him to say they did not want me to come to Vermont Square as the new regional librarian because I was a Negro. Mr. Hamill told them simply that they were establishing the new regional system and I had been appointed because I was qualified for the position. Also, that he was not reconsidering my appointment.
Hooray for him!
Later, the editor of the Southwest Wave phoned Mr. Hamill to ask him for a picture of me to publish in his newspaper. After securing a picture from my mother, he decided not to give it to the newspaper, because he thought it might be their way of letting the entire community know about my race. He told me they might send a photographer to take my picture, and I might﻿38
MM: (cont) think they were welcoming me to the community. "If a photographer comes," he said, "you may use your judgment about letting him take your picture. However, if anything occurs at any time that has to do with race, do not hesitate to speak freely and I'll back you all the way."
ER: Mr. Hamill is certainly to be admired for his democratic principles.
Indeed so. He inspired my confidence, and I noticed a definite change in Miss Bowler's attitude, too, after he came to the Los Angeles Public Library. At Vermont Square I encountered no problems with the community, and eventually established a good rapport with the local newspaper editor. Naturally, the older branch librarians resented the new regional system more than the younger ones, and I had more of the older ones in my region than any of the others. Helen Spotts, my first branch librarian, was transferred from the Hollywood branch (which became a regional branch) to the University branch in my region. Years ago, Miss Spotts had recommended the regional system used in large eastern cities for Los Angeles. Naturally she was disappointed not to have been selected as a regional librarian, but I feel certain her age was a factor. Three years later when she retired, I enclosed a note in her farewell gift telling her how much I appreciated the help she had given me when I first started substituting. In her reply she wrote: "Miriam, you are the nicest person I have ever worked with, up or down. If it had not been for your great understanding, I never could have stood this transition to the regional system."
That's a rare tribute.
Whenever new positions are created, the administration has the privilege of making the first appointments without a Civil Service examination being required. However, if such appointees do not take the Civil Service examination later, then they are not protected by Civil Service and may be demoted at any time. In June, 1949, the examination for principal librarian was announced for late September. A western regional conference of the American Library Association was being held in Canada in August, and all the regional librarians, except me, decided they would not go so they could spend every possible moment studying for the Civil Service examination. Not only did I have to attend the conference as a member of the American Library Association Council, but I also had to write and present reports for the California Library Association Committee on Intellectual Freedom and the American Library Association Committee on Intellectual Freedom. I was chairman of the California committee, but had to pinch-hit for the chairman of the American Library Association committee who did not have time to prepare his report nor attend the conference. Prior to leaving for Canada, I was one of the main speakers at the dedication of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company's new home office building in Los Angeles. Since I had been a consultant for the New York artists who painted two large murals for the building, depicting the history of the Negro in California, I was asked to describe the historical events which were highlighted in the murals.
Only one week before the Civil Service examination, I returned home from Canada to learn that my father had undergone major surgery and was a terminal patient. He died a few days after the examination. During the week before the examination, I visited my father at the hospital every day and had my hands full at the library, training new staff while my experienced professional﻿39
MM: (cont) staff was on vacation. I tried to study the night before the
examination, but kept nodding over my books and should have gone to bed instead. Mentally depressed and worn out physically, I felt I had done a very poor job when the written examination was over. When I was called for the oral examination, I knew that at least I had made a passing grade on the written examination. This time I knew all three members of the oral board, due to contacts made working in professional organizations, and I felt at ease with them. Four months later when the examination grades were mailed to the candidates, I was astonished to learn I was first on the list and ranked five points above the second person on the list.
Perhaps it proves how truly superior you were, placing first without studying, when the others had been cramming for three or four months.
MM: i only know it was a wonderful feeling! Both Mr. Hamill and Miss Bowler
congratulated me, recalling that it was difficult time for me, since I took the examination while my father was dying in the hospital.

ER: MM:
Tell us something about your duties as a regional librarian.
When I was appointed regional librarian of the South Central region in February, 1949, I had twelve branches under my supervision, staffed with sixty employees, and circulating approximately one million and a quarter books annually. Only one other region included twelve branches, and the Harbor region included only four branches. It was my responsibility to train, counsel and rate staff; approve vacation requests and substitutes; approve the branch librarians' requests for personnel, books, bindery and equipment; inspect branches thoroughly at least once a year to see that proper standards were maintained; review annual reports of the branch librarians and compile a regional summary, making special recommendations for the region to the administration; study trends and make surveys to help determine future requirements for library service in the region; and serve on administrative and professional committees to help develop new standards, policies and procedures for the improvement of the Los Angeles Public Library Extension System. It was really a full-time job, and there were times when we were short of staff. As a matter of fact, shortly before I retired, I had eight professional vacancies in my region without adequate professional substitutes. Some were only librarian assistants who were working full time while taking their library courses on a three-year plan at the University of Southern California. They could not be sent to small branches to substitute, since they could not be left in charge in the evenings. There were times when I had to do some of the substituting myself, which gave me a good chance to judge how well organized the branch was.
Why were there so many vacancies? Were people...
It was a time when librarians were at a premium. Every library school graduate had an opportunity to take his or her pick of three or four jobs. New graduates were interviewing the head librarians instead of vice versa, and in addition to asking about the salary and basic pension plan, they were asking what other fringe benefits were being offered! Since then, I believe the pendulum has swung back in the other direction, but I don't know what the current condition is in the job market.﻿40
ER: That's interesting. I suppose there are similar fluctuations in the job market for other professions and industries.
No doubt. Once a month the six regional librarians met with Miss Bowler, the assistant city librarian, when she presented us with projects the administration wished us to work on, and the regionals introduced problems in the branches which required a solution. In the afternoon of the same day, the regionals would meet without Miss Bowler to discuss mutual problems and make suggestions for improving the operation of the branches. One day I brought up a problem, a serious problem, that every branch had faced for years. I was stunned when the other five regionals refused to join me in presenting it to administration. About every seven or eight years the branches were painted inside and out in rotation. The painters, who were employed by the library department, spent from one to two months at a branch depending on its size, and could easily paint behind the book shelves a few sections at a time, yet invariably they would wait until the last day or two to do this part of the job. The painters' union would not permit them to take the books off the shelves, so they «ould tell the branch librarian one morning when there were no messenger clerks on duty to see that the books were removed immediately. Books would be stacked three rows deep on the tables, chairs and even on the floor. It was completely senseless to have the professional and clerical staff straining themselves lifting thousands of heavy volumes and working out of class, as well as having the library service disrupted for more than a week until the books could be reshelved. When I talked with the assistant city librarian and the personnel officer, they told me to hire a housewife in the neighborhood to help take the books off the shelf in the morning when there were no messenger clerks on duty. I told them this was not getting at the real problem. If the painters would let us clear a few sections at a time, our service would not be interrupted, our staff would not be working out of class and no additional help would be needed. I was amazed when they told me they had not discussed this matter with the business manager who was in charge of the maintenance department. They gave me permission to talk to him, and I discovered he knew nothing about this problem, and promised to take care of it immediately. This is an example of how timid some of the white employees were, even administrators, about tackling a problem which should have caused them to have no qualms at all.
I just can't believe it!
After serving as regional librarian of the South Central region for almost eleven years, I decided to retire at age fifty-four, to look for a position or positions abroad with UNESCO or the United States Department of State. I thought this would be more interesting than traveling in different foreign countries as a tourist. Long before the UNESCO interviewing team visited Los Angeles, I had decided I did not wish to work, since some of my friends told me librarians abroad were understaffed and working overtime just as we did here at home.
After my last administrative meeting with Miss Bowler and the other five regional librarians, she asked me to stop by her office. When I went to see her, another regional librarian was there to see her about a personal matter, and I was surprised when Miss Bowler made the following remarks in front of her. "Miriam, I don't know how you did it." "Did what?" I asked.﻿(cont) She added, "I don't know how you brought all of those older branch librarians around to accepting the regional system." My answer was, "I don't know what I did except be myself." She replied, "Well, that certainly did the trick." I might add that Miss Bowler rarely complimented anyone, even when she was giving them a superior service rating.
It occurred to me later that whenever my branch librarians brought a problem to me, I would always go to bat for them, even when I thought I would not be able to get the approval of administration. They knew I had their best interests at heart and would try at least to secure a favorable solution to their problems.
My retirement date was February 6, 1960, but since I had more than a month of accumulated vacation, I left the library on December 31, 1959. Before Christmas all the branches in the South Central region gave a farewell party for me at the Vermont Square regional branch. It was a gay occasion, and one of the branch librarians made a very touching speech when she presented me with their gift—a beautiful silver chafing dish. Two of my branch librarians wrote a flattering tribute to me which was published in the February 1960 issue of the Los Angeles Public Library Broadcaster. At the end was this sentence: "So we pay tribute to Miriam Matthews, not only as an outstanding librarian, but also as a woman to be admired and emulated."
Miss Bowler and the five regional librarians gave an intimate luncheon party for me at the Statler Hotel. I purchased a lovely silver covered casserole with the cash gift they gave me, and invited them to my home for luncheon later so they could see it.
The big retirement luncheon in my honor, which included staff members from the entire library system, was held at the Statler Hotel downtown. It was not held in the usual private dining room, because they could get better food in the restaurant where they served buffet luncheons. It was delicious and most of us ate too much. A large T-shaped banquet table was set up in the middle of the floor for our party, while regular patrons were permitted to use the booths around the wall. After we finished our luncheon, Mr. Hamill, the city librarian, addressed his opening remarks to the general public. "Generally when you think of a public employee, you think of someone who has his hand in your pocket and is not giving full value for the salary he is receiving. I want you to know that Miss Matthews is a public employee who has gone far beyond the call of duty during all the years she worked for the Los Angeles Public Library. Even after she left the library and was on vacation, she sat down and typed a very long memo to me, presenting suggestions she felt would benefit the library system. She cares what happens even after she has left." Then he turned to me and said, "Miss Matthews, I am going to give every single one of your recommendations very careful consideration." I cannot recall all that Mr. Hamill said and wish someone had made a tape recording. I do know, however, that he made me feel very proud.
I know you deserved every compliment you received and had a right to feel proud.
A letter from Mrs. Carma R. Zimmerman, the California state librarian, was another heart-warming experience. She wrote, "It was with considerable surprise that I noted in some of the newspaper clippings that you have retired from the Los Angeles Public Library. This does not seem possible! I want to offer my warmest congratulations and best wishes on a very distinguished﻿42
MM: (cont) career as a public librarian..."
ER: This shows you were held in high esteem by leaders in the library profession.
MM: In February I received, also, a special commendation from the Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors "for outstanding leadership in promoting cooperation among organizations and individuals interested in the welfare of children and youth and in making the community a better place in which to live." The Olympia Council of the California Congress of Parents and Teachers presented me with an honorary life membership in their organization, in recognition of my community work in the South Central region from 1949-1960. In the fall of 1960, the Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper named me one of the ten women of the decade in Los Angeles, honoring me for my outstanding contributions to the library.
ER: These fine tributes were a perfect ending for your outstanding career as a librarian, and started you on your retirement with a happy note.
MM: They did, indeed.
ER: We forgot to discuss on tape something that you discovered at the Helen Hunt Jackson branch after it was closed in the early 1950s. Would you care to talk about it now?
^M: As a matter of fact, it was not discovered at the branch. As the regional
librarian for the area, it was my responsibility to write a complete history of the Helen Hunt Jackson branch after it was closed. I went to the extension department at the Central Library to look through the files for additional information. I could scarcely believe my eyes when I read a letter written by Miss Warren, the assistant city librarian, to Everett R. Perry, the city librarian, on July 23, 1929, shortly before my appointment to the Helen Hunt Jackson branch. After writing to several cities in the East and South for advice, she was recommending to Mr. Perry that they experiment with an all-colored staff at Helen Hunt Jackson. She said I was well qualified to head the branch, since I had first-class credentials from the University of California in Berkeley, and my experience at the Robert Louis Stevenson branch had shown I was far above average in efficiency, personality and book knowledge. Then she mentioned Miss Byrd Holland, a Negro librarian who had come to California recently from Texas, as a possible children's librarian. She was to be placed on a temporary appointment until she completed some courses at the Los Angeles Public Library library school and eventually passed the Civil Service examination. Miss Warren said they could get a Negro youth to replace the white page who shelved the books. In addition to Negroes, she indicated the clientele at the branch included "Jewish and other foreign races" who probably would have no aversion to a colored librarian. This is how Miss Warren ended her memo, "It is the only hope of promotion for Miss Matthews in our system. If she succeeds, the satisfaction and pride of her people will be great, and their loyalty to the library increased. If the race reaction is not as we expect, it will be easy to return to our former policy of a white librarian in charge."
What was your reaction to that? Understanding some of the things you had been through, having discovered that awful letter, what was your...﻿43
MM: I was stunned. I was angry. I could not believe it, especially since I
had worked successfully as a librarian in the Jefferson, Vermont Square and Robert Louis Stevenson branches, all serving a white middle-class clientele! Perhaps I should not mention it, but I removed the letter from the file because I did not want future generations reading it.
ER: And rightly so.
MM: Perhaps I should mention that Miss Holland married and moved out of the city after serving as children's librarian less than a year, and before her training was completed. I had white children's librarians the next four years at Helen Hunt Jackson.
ER: So they were not able to keep an all-colored staff there after all?
MM: No, and it was ironic in more ways than one, because most of the Negro and white patrons thought Miss Holland was white because she was a blonde with
blue eyes!
ER: That's one for the books!
MM: With rare exceptions, I did not mention to anyone outside the family circle the discrimination I had suffered in the Los Angeles Public Library until after I retired. Most of my friends who were teachers and social workers thought I had had an easy time and that they were the only ones who had felt the sting of prejudice.
ER: Now, I was thinking that you became a librarian at a time when virtually every one thought the odds were stacked completely against you, and the possiblility of your succeeding in this profession was practically nil. What was your reaction to that? What made you go on and how did you handle it?
MM: Strangely enough, it didn't bother me at all, even though I was not a very
aggressive person in those days. My parents and friends all said, "You won't get a job." Yet by an odd twist of fate, friends who graduated about the same time I did, who planned to teach, waited until the thirties to get a permanent appointment, while I secured mine just a few months after graduation. This might prove it pays to take a chance.
ER: So you are saying one should not limit his goals to the choices currently available to a Negro?
^ That's right.
What is your attitude towards the women's movement, both as it is today and as it may have been in years past? I think I recall your saying you've always been a believer in woman's rights.
Yes, in general I approve anything that promotes the welfare and equal rights of women. Yet I do not agree with all of the proposals made by the present women's movement, and definitely would not describe myself as a "women's libber".
Feminist?﻿44
Possibly. I suppose the label is unimportant. However, I believe first of all, that women should get any job they are equipped to hold, and be paid and promoted on an equal basis with men. I expressed my opinion on this subject during an oral examination, when I was asked what I thought about the increasing numbers of men in the library profession. I said I thought it was healthy to have a good mixture of the sexes, but felt weak men should not be promoted to supervisory positions in a profession still dominated by women simply because they are men.
I agree. Speaking of men, your brother, Charles Hearde Matthews, is a very successful attorney. I recall your mentioning earlier that when he graduated from the Boalt Hall School of Law at Berkeley several of his white classmates had access to large law firms for their first positions.
Not several every single one. My brother was the only Negro in his class, and ranked among the top seven who received the Juris Doctor degree, a special honor at that time. Today, most of the law schools give this degree to all their graduates, who formerly would have received a Bachelor of Laws degree. Charles served on the editorial board of the California Law Review, and for years his articles were quoted in various court decisions. Despite his outstanding record, my brother was the only member of his class who did not receive a single invitation to join a law firm.
Can you tell us a bit more about his career? I understand he worked in the district attorney's office in Los Angeles.
First he took the state bar examination in San Francisco before returning home. After an extended trip east, he went into the private practice of law in Los Angeles, renting office space in the new Elks building on Central Avenue. He practiced about a year before being appointed a deputy district attorney by District Attorney Buron Fitts. Leon Whitaker, the first Negro to hold a similar position, died during his first year in office. Charles started out in the complaint department in 1931, and when he resigned from the district attorney's office fourteen years later, he was in charge of the master calendar department of the Superior Court, one of the highest posts available under Civil Service. One day when my brother was trying an interesting murder case, my mother and I went to court to see him in action. While waiting outside to enter the courtroom, a young man asked me what my interest was in the case. When I told him my brother was the prosecutor he said, "Charles Matthews is one of the best! That's why I am here. I never miss one of his cases." The defendant in this murder trial was very wealthy and had a team of high-powered attorneys. They thought my brother would be a pushover because he looked so young. Even though their client was found guilty, his attorneys were so impressed with my brother's skill they offered him a position with their firm.
Terrific. That's great advertising although attorneys aren't supposed to advertise.
During World War II, a number of the experienced white deputies who were reserve officers either enlisted or were drafted. Since my brother was not a reserve officer, the district attorney's office finally kept him deferred, because they had so few experienced men to run the office. For about a year, my brother was placed in charge of the Long Beach office. Even though he﻿45
MM: (cont) disliked the long drive to and from work, he felt obliged to do it until they were able to get a qualifed person to take his place.
In the spring of 1945, he resigned to go into private practice. He was first associated with David W. Williams, who is now a federal judge. After Mr. Williams received his first appointment to the municipal bench in Los Angeles, my brother took several new attorneys into his office (one at a time) to give them training and encouragement. In 1963, he moved his office from the Liberty Savings & Loan Association building at 2510 South Central Avenue to the new Family Savings & Loan Association building at 3683 Crenshaw Boulevard, taking Jimmie Reese for his law partner. At one time Mayor Tom Bradley and Congresswoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke occupied offices in their suite of offices on the fifth floor. Jimmie Reese is now a judge, and Charles's current partner is James Rogers. Charles Hearde Matthews, Jr., who is also a graduate of Boalt Hall in Berkeley, and like his father an editor of the California Law Review, will join his father's law firm soon, when he resigns from his position as a deputy in the Los Angeles County Public Defender's office. In addition to his Juris Doctor's degree, Charles, Jr., has a master's degree in business administration.
ER: I feel certain your brother will enjoy having his son on his team!
MM: No doubt. My brother was the first Negro appointed to the Los Angeles City
Police Commission and served from 1946-50. A member of the panel of examiners of the Los Angeles Civil Service Commission, he gave oral examinations to prospective police officers, and also served as a hearing officer for the Commission. He is a former member of the California State Law Revision Commission and the board of directors of the Liberty Savings & Loan Association, the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP, the 28th Street YMCA and others. He is presently serving on the boards of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, the Family Savings & Loan Association, and the Golden State Minority Foundation; and is also an arbitrator for the American Arbitration Association. He holds membership in the American, National, and Criminal Courts Bar Associations, Langston Law Club, Lawyers Club of Los Angeles, and State Bar of California, for which he was chairman of the Criminal Law and Procedure Committee on Legislation. He is listed in Who's Who in the West and Who's Who in Colored America.
ER: That's a most impressive list of achievements. Now what about your older sister, Ella? You said she'd gone to business college...
MM: After she graduated from the Efficiency Business College in Los Angeles, she
worked four or five years for Louis M. Blodgett, a successful Negro contractor, who at one time had been associated with his older brother, Charles Blodgett. Both brothers, with their separate contracting firms, erected large buildings in downtown Los Angeles, long before it was generally known that Negro contractors were capable of doing anything on that scale. After leaving Mr. Blodgett, for whom she was bookkeeper and secretary, she took a similar position with Harvey Brothers, sand and gravel contractors. This was a Negro firm operated by three brothers, who inherited the business from their father, a pioneer Angeleno. Ella became so proficient she was permitted to give bids for the customers when the officers were not there, and often got better prices for the materials than her bosses. If a truck driver phoned the office because his truck had broken down, she had to arrange for someone else to take﻿46
MM: (cont) the sand and gravel to the job, and in the meantime pacify the contractor whose job was being held up. After several years with this firm, she left because she was not satisfied with the salary she was getting. She started taking some business courses, and a short time later was offered the position of assistant secretary at the Liberty Savings & Loan Association. That was in 1935, and three years later she was promoted to the position of secretary. Shortly thereafter, she was appointed to the board of directors.
ER: Is that a black institution? Was that one of the first...
MM: Yes. It was the first black financial institution in Los Angeles, and was
organized as the Liberty Building and Loan Association in 1924. It survived the "bank holiday" ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in March 1933, when many larger financial institutions went under. The Liberty asked the holders of guarantee stack to pay an assessment on their shares to help the institution. Some of the stockholders thought they would be throwing good money after bad, so they let their stock go. This put the association in a sounder financial position, and L.M. Blodgett, the president, managed to pull it through this crisis and eventually get all accounts federally insured.
Did she remain secretary there long?
Yes, she remained secretary, and a memeber of the board of directors until her death in 1960. She married L.M. Blodgett, the president, in 1948, and together they built the Liberty Savings & Loan Association into a strong institution. Unfortunately, a few years after my sister's death, the association passed into white hands, with the guarantee stock bringing record prices from $8,000 to more than $14,000 a share.
Was it the forerunner of such institutions as Family Savings...
Yes, it was followed by the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company, the Broadway Federal Savings & Loan, Family Savings & Loan (formerly Watts Savings & Loan), Safety Savings & Loan (now defunct), Bank of Finance, Enterprise Savings & Loan, Founders Savings & Loan, and others.
I was wondering about the depression. I'd like you to tell me about some of the things you remember. How it affected you and those around you. It even affected the library system. Tell us something about that.
I shall mention my family first. During the depression my father had to let all his painters go, because he could not afford the workmen's compensation insurance and Social Security payments, since most people felt they could get along without painting their houses since money was so scarce. My father worked alone during that period, and had a greatly reduced income because he had to charge lower prices and was not doing a large volume of work. Charles, Ella and I had jobs and were self-supporting, so we did not feel the pinch as much as other families.
With the growth of social welfare, teachers without jobs become social workers, since an A.B. degree in any subject field made them eligible. It was many years before some of them were able to transfer to the teaching field, since teachers were not resigning or retiring as early as formerly
You are right. The library system was greatly affected by the depression.﻿47
MM: (cont) Libraries were the mecca for all of the people who did not have the money to go to the movies or indulge in any type of commercial recreation; also for the unemployed who wished to study the Civil Service manuals and other books which might help them find and hold a job; and for those who were pursuing their education and could not afford to buy all the books they needed. In the meantime, everything was cut, including library staffs, salaries, book budgets and library hours. Even though there was less money for new books and fewer people to man the desks, circulation continued to soar everywhere and librarians were dropping from exhaustion.

The soup lines, the bread lines and people really suffering. Did any of that occur here?
MM:: Our warm climate and general conditions in Los Angeles made the depression here seem mild compared with other large cities in the country. There may have been soup lines in the skid row area of town, but the free soup kitchens exist there all the time for these skid row derelicts. I do not recall any long soup lines in the city for the general population. Even though people had to pull in their belts and do without a few essentials, I was not aware of any intense suffering. A number of those without jobs were employed by the WPA (Works Progress Administration) and the NYA (National Youth Administration) . In the library when we were able to get qualified individuals under these programs, they were a boon to our hard-working staffs. Yes, we felt the depression here, but not with the same intensity as in other sections of the country.
ER: When did the depression occur? About eleven years after World War I?
^M: The depression began after the stock market	crash in 1929, and I guess it lasted into the early 1940s.
Still felt the impact that long? But let's	see now, you were two years out
of college just before the depression as we	remember it.
Yes, I started working in 1927, at age twenty-one.
Let's see, so what were you then in 1918 when the doughboys were... I was thirteen years old and attending junior high school. Do you recall anything of that era?
You mean of World War I? One of the most impressive events I recall was the presidential election of 1916. Woodrow Wilson was running for reelection with the slogan "He kept us out of war," and was opposed by Charles'Evans Hughes. In the days before radio and television, when important news broke, the newspapers would have an "extra" out on the streets within two or three hours after they received the news. Since the election results were expected in the middle of the night, the public was alerted to expect the electric lights to flash on and off three times if Hughes was elected, and five times if Wilson was the victor. We went to school the next morning thinking Hughes had been elected, and most of the students were very sad thinking the United﻿

(cont) States soon would be involved in the European war. When the election returns came in from the outlying regions the next day, it was discovered that President Wilson had been reelected by a very slim margin. The jubilation of the antiwar forces was short-lived. Wilson's attempts to mediate the war failed within a few months, and when the Germans started unrestricted submarine warfare, sinking the ships of neutral nations, he asked for a declaration of war against Germany, which was voted April 6, 1917. Our soldiers fought overseas until the armistice was signed November 11, 1918.
Our personal lives were devoted to helping in little ways, buying Thrift Stamps and Liberty Bonds, growing small vegetable gardens at home and conserving food in every possible way, so there would be more to ship to the countries devastated by war. Soon we became accustomed to doing without various products, or putting up with inferior substitutes. That was the way it was!
Young as you were, I am certain you realized that war is bad for everyone. Definitely.
To switch to another subject, I believe you said your family had a Model T Ford.
Yes, my father purchased a 1914 Model T Ford, secondhand, for $250. Oh, for the day...
But you must remember, people were not earning very much in those days. Speaking of automobiles, our family physician, Dr. John Outlaw, had a large one in the days when very few people owned any kind of a car. As small children we were delighted when he had to make a house call, because we knew when he was ready to leave he would let all of the children on the block crowd into his automobile for a thrilling ride to the corner. One youngster asked the doctor if his car was a Packard. He replied, "No, but it packs them in all right!"
Was your family doctor white or black?
Dr. Outlaw was black, and arrived in Los Angeles from Washington, D.C., in 1901. With the exception of Dr. Monroe A. Majors, the first Negro doctor to pass the California State Board of Medical Examiners, who practiced medicine in Los Angeles from 1888 to 1890, Dr. Outlaw may have been the first of several Pioneer Negro doctors to settle in Los Angeles around the turn of the century. % parents received good advice from Dr. Outlaw on subjects other than medicine, which proved helpful to them as new arrivals in the city. Both he and his wife became good friends of the family.
That's most interesting. What else do you remember about new developments or inventions when you were young? The airplane, for example.
For a number of years, at least until 1918,1 believe, when an airplane was heard overhead, both adults and children would run out of the house to see it.﻿49
(cont) They would point at it and yell until it flew out of sight. It was really exciting!
I imagine it was. I remember when my parents bought our first television set in the early fifties, everyone in the neighborhood came over to watch it. What type of reaction was there to the first radio set in your neighborhood, or do you recall when you got your...
Yes, in 1922 or 1923, we had a little crystal radio set with two earphones. So many of our young friends came over that we had to take turns, two at a time, each using one earphone. If someone listened too long, someone would nudge him and say, "Hurry up, it's my turn to listen!" No matter what program was on, we were tremendously interested, since it was such a novelty.
I'd like to bounce to another era, World War II. I recall your mentioning something about a war camp in San Bernardino, where you and a colleague went to take some books...
Yes, Beulah Woodard, my artist friend, and I had collected a carload of books, which we wanted to give to the black soldiers at March Field, an army base in San Bernardino. The officials were notified in advance, and they assigned a Negro chaplain to meet us and take charge of the books. He escorted us all over the base and explained a lot of things to us. As I recall, there were ^ only one or two black officers. They were permitted to use the white officers mess hall, because there were too few for a separate one, but they did not participate in general social activities with the white officers.
Do you mean the black and white soldiers were completely separated at March Field in California?
Yes, they had separate barracks, separate mess halls and separate recreation centers.
own
I can't believe this is true—American citizens segregated in their country during basic training for combat, more than twenty years after World War I, when we fought to make the world "safe for democracy!" How were things really during that World War II era? I remember reading about women going to work in the factories...
The war industries brought thousands of people to Los Angeles, especially blacks and whites from the South. This created some racial friction. Southern blacks were ready to enjoy the lack of legal segregation in California, while the southern whites resisted conforming to our laws. While sitting in a lighted movie theatre downtown, when people were coming in for the first showing of the day, a white southerner behind me said, "Look at them [meaning Negroes], sitting wherever they please. We wouldn't let them do that back home. Although the sales people in the department stores and other businesses continued to treat the long-time Negro residents with courtesy and respect, they were often rude and discourteous to the new arrivals. Some stores did not wish to wait on them at all, until they learned that they could pay cash for fur coats and other luxury items.
Were there any black sales people in those days?﻿50
MM: Oh no! Not in Los Angeles, that is unless they were fair enough to pass for white. It was a long time before they broke into the sales field. There were Negro stock girls who wore neat black dresses, and looked just like the white sales girls, but their job was to arrange the new stock and return dresses to the proper racks. When I was in New York in 1940, a leading Fifth Avenue store employed a Negro saleswoman — I believe this was a first. The story was carried in the Nation magazine. She was assigned to the perfume department on the first floor. The floorwalker took her to the department and said to a white salesperson, "This is Miss Smith, and she will be working here with you." And the woman fainted!
ER: Oh my!
MM: Employers used to say if they hired Negroes it would cause a business slump. This Negro became one of the top saleswomen in a first-class store with a high-class clientele. Customers used to ask for her when she was off duty.
It was still a closed field for Negroes in Los Angeles, except for those who were passing.
ER: Was there much passing, do you know?
MM: a fair amount, I believe, judging by those I knew personally. Some of these Negroes tried to avoid their Negro friends when they came in to shop, while others acted perfectly natural.
ER:
ER: MM:
MM;
Was there a feeling of understanding about someone being in that position, someone who was passing and trying to get a better job, or was there a feeling of resentment?
It depended on the individual. Some Negroes resented them, and actually exposed them to their employers. Others thought as long as they had a good job they couldn't get any other way, well, more power to them!
I was thinking about the saleswoman in New York you just told me about. Was she obviously Negro or do you know?
As I recall, she was brown-skinned, and could not have been mistaken for any other ethnic group.
Your entire family, from photographs I've seen, and a lovely family it is, are very fair-skinned...
Well, you can't always tell by pictures. My two grandfathers, my mother and my brother are all brown-skinned. Also a number of uncles and aunts. As far back as I can trace my mother and father's family trees, they are almost identical in terms of the number of Negro, Indian and white ancestors. They both had a great-grandfather, my mother and father, who was full-blooded Indian, they both had a certain amount of either English or Scotch-Irish blood, and so in terms of Negro-Indian and white blood, they were about the same. My mother was brown-skinned, while my father was fair enough to pass for white. This proves you can't judge a Negro's background by his color.﻿51

Do you recall any advantages? I remember hearing people say, "If you're black, get back; if you're brown, stick around; if you're white, you're all right." Do you recall any advantages to being a fair-skinned or a brown-skinned Negro as opposed to one with a darker skin? Or what was the feeling about it at that time?
Well, I don't know...
Any resentment towards you or...
The matter of reaction to gradations of color varies with the individual whites or blacks, and it is difficult to generalize. I will say, however, that there was a tendency, in certain Negro social circles years ago, to favor those with a light or light-brown skin. The few dark-skinned ones who gained acceptance either came from outstanding families or had achieved a certain personal distinction. This is no longer true today. Personally, I have not felt my color was any special advantage or disadvantage. On a few occasions darker Negroes have resented my color. By and large, if you are known to be a Negro, you feel the sting of prejudice no matter what your color. During World War II when businesses were asked to obey the presidential executive order, they would select the darkest and least qualified Negroes, so the public would complain, and they would have an excuse to fire them. Then they would say, "We tried but it didn't work." I should not have generalized with the foregoing statement, because some businesses honestly tried and succeeded in doing the right thing for minorities.
Well, you've had your trials and tribulations trying to work your way up through the library system. I was wondering if you could ever have used it towards your advantage or was it ever a particular disadvantage for you?
I can't say whether my color helped or hindered me in any way. The main point is, I was a Negro and they knew it! When I went to the University of Chicago, they instituted reports, you know, staff ratings. So when I came back, they were supposed to be rating me on my whole previous six months service, but they were going all the way back through my whole service and rating me. And what they really were rating me on was my attitude, you know, in terms of speaking up about race, but they didn't say this. What do you think they marked me low on? Quantity and quality of my work. And those were the two things that I knew that nobody could... I could run circles around most of them in terms of the amount of work I put in, and of course I knew it was of good quality. But when she was talking to me about the ratings, she made some comment that made me know that she was rating me on attitude, but she said it had improved lately. And do you know, I said, "You're not rating me on my attitude. You're rating me on your attitude."
Miss Matthews, what about your overall experience as a member of the library staff? How would you characterize that?
It was a very happy experience for me, and I had a whole circle of friends, not only those who worked with me, but others as well, such as branch librarians, heads of departments at Central Library, and those who served me on various committees. Many have been guests in my home and I in theirs, even as overnight﻿52
MM:

MM:
(cont) guests.. Some developed into lifelong friends, and we still keep in touch from time to time, even though some have moved out of the city since they retired. Of course during the eighteen years since my retirement, some have passed on. I have fond memories of many of them, especially those who were so kind to me in the early days of my career; Helen Spotts, Reba Dwight, lone Rider Barber, Hortense Mitchell, Helen E. Haines, Anne Leidendecker, Katherine Garbutt and a number of others. The last thirteen years I spent with the Los Angeles Public Library were perhaps the happiest and most fulfilling, due to the arrival of a new city librarian, Harold L. Hamill, a man of sterling character, high standards and democratic principles. He recognized me for my personal worth and achievements as a librarian, not as a Negro librarian, which gave me a greater feeling of confidence and security. Roberta Bowler, the assistant city librarian, was a changed person under Mr. Hamill's administration and we became friends also, who exchanged social courtesies in our homes. The administrative assistant, Katherine Laich, who succeeded Miss Bowler as assistant city librarian when she retired, was a warm friend whom I admired very much. All in all the good far outweighed the bad, and I can look back on my thirty-odd years in the library with no real bitterness.
I'm happy to hear that.
This might be a good time to pay special tribute to Miss Helen E. Haines, who probably influenced my success in the library world more than any other individual. Miss Haines was not a librarian, but a person with a broad knowledge of books and the book publishing world. She was a member of the library school faculty at the Los Angeles Public Library, and a guest professor at the School of Librarianship at Berkeley the year I took my course there. It was in her class on book selection at Berkeley where we first met. Her course was stimulating but difficult, because it was given six days a week and concentrated into a five-week period, so she could get back to Los Angeles in time for the fall opening of the library school there. As far as I know, she paid no special attention to me while I was in her class, and I was not particularly attracted to her. Our next contact was at the Helen Hunt Jackson branch when she reviewed books for my book club, and my brother and I drove her to her Pasadena home afterwards. She was a regular lecturer at the central library auditorium, and made special appearances at branches with book clubs. After her first visit to Helen Hunt Jackson, she asked to be put on our book club schedule every year. Perhaps this was when she first began to notice me. After Miss Haines discontinued her lectures for the Los Angeles Public Library in the mid-thirties, I do not recall seeing her for at least ten years. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Evelyn S. Little, president of the California Library Association, appointed me chairman of the Committee on Intellectual Freedom in 1946, even though I had not served previously on the committee. Later I learned that Miss Haines not only had suggested my name, but had urged my appointment.
How wonderful! She certainly must have been impressed with your ability.
A few months after the American Library Association Committee on Intellectual Freedom was organized in 1940, Miss Haines established the California committee with the same name. For a long time it was the only state intellectual freedom committee in the country. Miss Haines was the first chairman of the California committee; Theodora Brewitt, head of the Long Beach Public Library, the second;﻿53
MM: (cont) and I was the third. Not only was this the beginning of an upturn in my professional career, but also a very close association and friendship with Miss Haines, which was to last until her death. Always she was ready to give me encouragement and advice.
A true friend.
mm: a native New Yorker, Helen Haines began her career in 1892, at the age of twenty, in the editorial department of the Library Journal, which at that time was the official organ of the American Library Association. For sixteen years, she was the recorder for the national conventions of the Association, and also indexed the proceedings, for which she received the sum of ten dollars! She served as vice-president of the New York State Library Association, and second vice-president of the American Library Association; taught at the library schools of Columbia University, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of Southern California, and the Los Angeles Public Library; edited several basic library tools; published important library articles in a variety of periodicals, as well as two books, What's in a_ Novel? and Living with Books, which have been used widely in library schools throughout the country. Moreover, she was the recipient of several national awards.
In the second edition of Living with Books published in 1950, Miss Haines mentioned my master's thesis as being excellent and practical, and autographed my copy of her book in the following manner: "Inscribed for Miriam Matthews who keeps the Lamp of Intellectual Freedom filled and burning over library shelves. With the love and admiration of Helen E. Haines. January, 1951."
You must be proud of that inscription.
Indeed I am. In 1946 when I became chairman of the California Library Association Intellectual Freedom Committee, a wave of reaction had set in throughout the state, due in great part to the activities of State Senator Jack Tenney and his California Committee on Un-American Activities. The annual reports published by this committee implied that a number of distinguished authors were subversive. Since a majority of the state's legislators disapproved of certain volumes in the Building America series, published for a department of the National Education Association, the entire state budget for the schools was held up, to force the withdrawal of this series. Some little group in Palo Alto, calling themselves a chapter of the Sons of the American Revolution, found fault especially with the book on Russia, which was simply a text showing how the Russian people lived, how they ate, how they grew their food, all their general activities. There wasn't anything political in it at all which would affect any child. As a result of the crusade against these and other books, eight bills to amend the State Education Code were referred to the Senate Education Committee. Our Intellectual Freedom Committee was most concerned with SB 1026 and 1027, which would have eliminated almost all instruction in sex and marriage problems in the public schools; would have prohibited instruction in controversial subjects, and the distribution and use of propaganda materials. This was in direct conflict with the basic principle of education, which "makes it obligatory for both the teacher and the student to make a fearless and unbiased examination of all sides of controversial issues." Resolutions presented by our committee, to oppose the passage of Senate Bills 1026 and 1027, and to defend the Building America series were adopted at the southern district meeting of the California﻿54
(cont) Library Association on April 12, 1947. The southern district, representing almost half of the state's membership, sent the resolutions, to the Senate Education Committee while Association members sent copies to their own senators. The Senate bills were defeated in committee.
That must have been gratifying.
Yes, but we eventually lost the fight over the Building America series in California, which lasted two years. However, we feel the national attention we brought to this series, which has been widely used throughout the country, alerted educators in other states to the possibility of similar moves elsewhere with regards to other materials as well as Building America.
One cannot expect immediate success all the time.
That's true. On August 26, 1947, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors ordered all county employees to sign a loyalty oath. In addition to the standard oath to uphold the laws of California and the United States, this oath included a list of 142 organizations compiled by the California Un-American Activities Committee. Employees were asked to indicate current or former membership in any of these organizations which were deemed subversive. Even though they had never belonged to any of the listed organizations, a number of county employees, including twelve librarians, objected to the list as an invasion of privacy. Those who refused to sign the entire oath were fired, while those who failed to check the list of organizations worked under the threat of immediate dismissal, should the courts decide in favor of the County Board of Supervisors. Before this case reached the highest courts, the president signed Executive Order #9835, which started loyalty checks of federal government employees on October 1, 1947. Out of approximately 2,201,000 loyalty forms processed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a short period of time, three percent were given full-field investigations and only fifty-one were fired. How many of these would have been discharged in less hysterical days is anyone's guess. Other jurisdictions instituted loyalty oaths, but none were as objectionable as that of the county of Los Angeles.
Wasn't it President Franklin D. Roosevelt who said, "The greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself?"
Yes, it was. Our next challenge came from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, who voted to appoint a citizens.' committee to approve the books purchased for the Los Angeles. County Library, which was the legal responsibility of John D. Henderson, the county librarian. One supervisor accused Mr. Henderson of harboring "liberal ideas," and hesitating before signing the county loyalty oath. As soon as we learned of this new development through the newspapers, our Committee on Intellectual Freedom went to work. A long-distance call to the executive director of the American Library Association in Chicago resulted in telegrams being sent from his office to all five supervisors, opposing this censorship committee which violated our library bill of rights. At the next meeting of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, representatives of several organizations that had been contacted by our California Intellectual Freedom Committee spoke against the board's proposal. Representing the California Library Association, I told the supervisors we had the backing of the 18,000 members of the American Library Association, and we believed it was the﻿55
(cont) responsibility of librarians to provide books presenting all points of view, to permit the public to form its own opinions on the basis of all available information. At the conclusion of the meeting, the supervisors suspended their motion and asked the county counsel for a legal opinion. There was a large crowd on hand that day, including newspaper and radio reporters.
Those were busy times!
One week later the annual convention of the California Library Association was held in Santa Barbara. The Intellectual Freedom Committee had been assigned an entire evening session to present a special program. When the president of California Library Association learned that our guest speaker was Dr. J.E. Wallace Sterling, president-elect of Stanford University, he insisted on making the introduction, even though I was supposed to preside throughout the evening. After responding to Dr. Sterling's scholarly address, I presented the report of the Intellectual Freedom Committee which began as follows:
Today we are faced with a menace more deadly and more terrifying than the atom bomb. It paralyzes, cripples and enslaves men's minds and leaves them incapable of independent thought. When it gains complete control of an entire population, freedom is banished. It happened in Germany, it happened in Italy, it happened in Russia, Czechoslovakia and Japan. Now we have come to grips with it in America. What is this menace? Censorship. Censorship which leads to thought control.
Only a week ago the supervisors of Los Angeles County announced that they will appoint a lay committee to censor the books of the Los Angeles County Library to eliminate "those with a Communist taint." This shocking news is perhaps the worst we have received since the banning of the Nation in New York and New Jersey and the police raids on the Philadelphia book stores last spring.
To demonstrate the devastating influence of these current restrictions on free inquiry this committee has prepared an exhibit at this conference. Included are books and magazines currently banned in various parts of America which, believe it or not, includes Life magazine. Shown also are blown-up copies of news items on both sides of this censorship controversy with current editorials from newspapers in the Los Angeles area and from Publishers' Weekly condemning the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for their recent action.
That must have had a great impact on your audience.
I believe it did. At the conclusion of my report I introduced Edwin N. Hughes, to tell the story of the Los Angeles County Library employees who refused to sign the county loyalty oath, since it was felt that the facts and issues involved had not been reported completely in the newspapers. Highlights of Mr. Hughes's speech are:
We believe the request for an affidavit regarding our connections with 142 organizations is a violation of our civil rights. Our﻿56
MM:	(cont) refusal to sign is motivated by this principle and not by
any desire to conceal our associations...
The stated purpose of the loyalty check is to "determine whether any county employee advocates the overthrow of constitutional government by force or violence." We believe its real purpose is to intimidate us, to deter us from association for action on important issues... We are asked, "Why if you are loyal do you refuse to sign this loyalty check?" We reply, "It is not a test of loyalty but a coercive measure and, in refusing, we are obeying the honored American tradition of resistance to oppression. . ."
ER: MM:
ER: EH:
Although there are nine known Communists on the county payroll (none from the public library) county counsel Harold W. Kennedy pointed out the county can do nothing about it legally so long as the nine signed the loyalty affidavit, which they did. Kennedy said, "The Supreme Court has ruled that advocacy of the forceful overthrow of government must be proved in individual cases. Being a Communist, per se, is not grounds for discharge." Since this Los Angeles County loyalty check shows no evidence of accomplishing its stated purpose. . .we reiterate our stand in determined opposition to this and all similarly conceived loyalty checks.
That evening's program was concluded with a first reading by me of two Intellectual Freedom Committee resolutions, protesting repressive loyalty investigations, and opposing the Los Angeles County supervisors' censorship committee. Two days later these resolutions were adopted at the final business session of the California Library Association.
What an excellent and stimulating program!
The next day a number of conference delegates came to our Intellectual Freedom Committee exhibit booth to congratulate me. Some said they thought our committee reports were more important than Dr. Sterling's fine speech. Many were indignant that no mention had been made of our program in the local newspaper, since they felt it was the highlight of the convention. It was learned later that the president of the California Library Association, who was also head of the Santa Barbara Public Library, thought our meeting might be too controversial for conservative Santa Barbara, and told the local editor he did not need to send a reporter that evening.
There was a lot of fear during this time, wasn't there? Yes.
. . .a lot of concern about being pointed to as a Communist?
Definitely. However, many of the younger members of the association told me in Santa Barbara, "For the first time we feel it is important to belong to a professional association, because now it is concerned with matters vital to the profession." It pleased me to know they appreciated my efforts in helping﻿57
MM: (cont) to develop this new trend.
ER: It took some courage.
MM: Somehow I never thought about being courageous, only doing what I thought was
right. Early in 1947, I was elected to the American Library Association Council for a four-year term, and was installed at the San Francisco national convention in June. This permitted me to attend the American Library Association midwinter meetings and national conventions until 1951, with my expenses paid by the city of Los Angeles. Late in 1947, I was appointed to the American Library Association Committee on Intellectual Freedom, and discovered afterwards that Miss Haines had suggested me for this appointment.
ER: This was the beginning of your career on the national scene, wasn't it?
Yes. In her first communication to me in December, 1947, Alice G. Higgins, committee chairman, wrote: "I am happy to welcome you to the American Library Association committee on Intellectual Freedom, particularly since we need your advice on some of our current problems." Three resolutions from the Library Unions Round Table, and one from the Massachusetts Library Association had been referred to the committee for action by the American Library Association Council. Apparently I was the only committee member who thought any action was called for on any of the round table resolutions. Since Miss Higgins could not attend the A.L.A. midwinter meeting, due to illness, she sent a tentative report, and asked Emily Miller Danton to act in her place. When the committee met at the midwinter conference in Chicago, I was the only member who felt we should present a stronger statement in view of current trends. So they elected me to write and present the report. Written under pressure, just before the last session of the conference, I was astonished when my report was the only one the audience applauded that afternoon.
ER: Great!
111 health forced Miss Higgins to resign, and she was succeeded by David K. Berninghausen, a former student of Miss Haines and one of her ardent admirers. Head of the Cooper Union Library in New York, Berninghausen was a true activist and tremendously interested in promoting intellectual freedom. Impressed with the accomplishments of our California Intellectual Freedom Committee, he did not hesitate to call on me or Miss Haines for assistance or advice during his chairmanship. He asked Miss Haines to revise the 1939 version of the American Library Association Library Bill of Rights, to present to the A.L.A. Council for adoption at the 1948 national convention. Miss Haines wrote the first draft, but was too busy to rework it, so I did the final editing with Miss Haines's approval. Twenty thousand copies of The Right to Find Out, a pamphlet issued by the California Library Association Committee on Intellectual Freedom, were distributed at the American Library Association and the National Education Association national conventions that year. The booklet included our California committee's analysis of the criticisms of Building America; its April, 1948, intellectual freedom report and resolution protesting loyalty investigations; also, statements written by Berninghausen, Helen Luce, the National Education Association, and yours truly. My statement began with these words: "The two-year controversy over the Building America textbook series in California is a warning to those who say, 'It can't happen here.' Suppression of opinion﻿58
MM: (cont) can happen in the United States, if the public, continues to ignore increasing attempts at censorship."
The American Library Association made history at its national convention, held in Atlantic City in June, 1948, devoting much of its program to the cause of intellectual freedom. President Paul North Rice, Pearl S. Buck, Dr. Robert B. Leigh, Arthur E. Farmer, and Dr. Luther Evans made eloquent addresses on the subject, and the American Library Association Council adopted the revised library bill of rights, and the resolution protesting loyalty investigations in libraries presented by the A.L.A. Intellectual Freedom Committee. The courageous stand which the Association took on censorship was applauded in news and editorial columns from coast to coast.
ER: You must have been proud of the role you played as a member of both the
Intellectual Freedom Committee and the American Library Association Council.
Indeed I was.
ER: Is there anything you would like to add to the intellectual freedom story?
MM: Through the years, more and more stress has been laid on this subject. Today, there is an Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association headquarters, which serves as the administrative arm of the Intellectual Freedom Committee, to implement A.L.A. policies, and publish the bimonthly Newsletter On Intellectual Freedom to keep members up-to-date on happenings in this field "throughout the nation and around the world. The Freedom to Read Foundation was incorporated, in 1969, as the American Library Association's response to the increased interest of its members in having the machinery to support and defend librarians whose jobs are jeopardized because they challenge violations of the library bill of rights. The Foundation also provides the means through which legal precedents can be set for the freedom to read.
Those of us who are not old enough to remember the McCarthy era feel, from the picture painted by the media, that it must have been a very frightening and terrifying time for many people, who were never sure if they were going to be reported for doing things which were perfectly innocent...
MM: You mean if they were reading certain periodicals or other literature?
... reading certain things, or suspected of belonging to so-called subversive organizations. Do you remember those times?
MM: indeed I do. California was full of it, and set a bad example for some of the other states in the union. The story of the ten Hollywood writers who were blacklisted because of their associations hit the headlines everywhere, even though they were not proven to be "un-American," and there was nothing subversive in the scenarios they wrote.
ER: I am left with the impression that almost anyone might have been suspected of being a Communist sympathizer at that time, even if he just insisted upon fair trial for a person accused of being a Communist.﻿59
MM: Yes, that's true. Many people were afraid to mention the name of the American
Civil Liberties Union, a very old and reputable civil rights organization. Like Voltaire, this organization might not believe what you have to say, but it will defend to the death your right to say it.
ER: That was more than thirty years ago. May I ask for your views today on censorship?
MM: I'm still against all forms of censorship. Even though some progress has been made, it still exists. It hardly seems possible that John Beecher, a college professor who is a descendant of Henry Ward Beecher, has just been reinstated at California State, San Francisco, along with several of his colleagues, after being discharged more than twenty-five years ago for refusing to sign a loyalty oath just to prove they were loyal Americans. It took an act of the California legislature to bring this about belatedly. Much of today's censorship involves books with strong language, which shocks individuals who cannot tell the difference between books which have literary merit and a social purpose, and those which are simply trash. There are these strange people who don't really read books regularly, so they pick up something that's modern, and maybe the last book they read was way back in school some twenty or thirty or fifty years ago. They may be a little shocked by the language, but what they do is take the sentence or the paragraph out of context. And if you read the whole book, you see that the author is giving a slice of a certain kind of life and he's describing it as it is.
And in some instances, years ago, when children would come in and ask for books and these were under fourteen, and I recall one book, I told them, "No, I'm sorry, we can't give that to you. Just adults may take that out." And one girl turned to the other, she says, "Oh, come on. I'll tell you about it at recess." It was the same way with Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath—that was one of the books that was frank in terms- of its language many years ago, but it was how the people lived and how they spoke. And two—looked like church ladies— came in one evening and wanted to get the book and I said, "I'm sorry. We have a long waiting list. It will cost you five cents for a postal to reserve it." And one of them said, "Five cents for that dirty book?" So they wanted to read it, but they didn't want to pay five cents for a postal card.
ER: We are said to be living in a much freer society today. I don't think they
have taken the ultimate survey to establish this fact, but we are led to believe that more and more people are living together. Single persons are now allowed to adopt children, and more unmarried women are having children out of wedlock intentionally. That's a big jump, isn't it? A big change from the way things were when you were a teenager, a young adult coming up?
Very definitely.
Can you compare and contrast for me?
Some of these points have been mentioned already. Until they were eighteen years old, most girls of my generation were accompanied to parties by an adult chaperon. Even after they were old enough to have an escort, some of the mothers would be sitting around the ballroom to see that everyone was behaving properly. In﻿60
(cont) those days if a girl happened to be indiscreet, her parents would send her away to have the baby. If word got around, it was discussed usually in subdued tones. Most people were genuinely sorry for her misfortune, although there were always a few who delighted in condemning her.
But there was a stigma attached?
Oh, yes. When an adult or married woman was known to be having an affair, some people stopped inviting her to their parties. Today, things are different. No matter how strictly you may have been reared, and even though you maintain your own personal standards, you still must adjust to the age, and recognize that everyone need not conform to your standards. My principal concern today is the child born out of wedlock, for I feel he lacks a certain sense of security when he is brought up this- way.
I know even when a child just loses one parent, they still feel that loss. I recall it) terror of ray kr«tier's child. His mother died when he was two years and four months old. My mother and I went to live with my brother for six years until he remarried. I'd bring home picture books, and he'd pick one out; but the main point I want to make, if there was a horse that was lonesome, anyone who was lonesome, he'd want you to read that story again and again. When the PTA met at school, my brother or I would get off from work. One particular day, I arrived before twelve o'clock, entered the front door of the auditorium, didn't know he was standing at the back door from the playground, stood there all noon hour, waiting for me to come. I was sitting in a corner where he couldn't see me and he didn't eat his lunch. And so when his teacher went back and called the names, when she called my name, his face lit up and she found out that he had been standing there all of that noontime because he thought I hadn't come. So it's very important when they know that most children have a mother and a father. . .if they're deprived of either one and especially by design. And so I feel it leaves a mark on a child.
A lot of my friends are still unmarried. Both men and women are waiting longer to get married, due to career considerations. Those who do go ahead and get married are waiting quite awhile before they begin a family. What is your feeling on what apparently is a new trend?
I think it's unfortunate that marriage often is delayed too long, even though some early marriages end in divorce. It's difficult to generalize, although I know two couples who married while in college, and each couple had one child before both partners had earned their professional degrees. Two of them finished law, one received a master's degree in business administration, and one a Ph.D. in public health. One couple is purchasing a home. In some instances it appears that marriage is a stabilizing influence, and gives the young people a common goal to work for.
Undoubtedly these two couples are exceptional. Nevertheless, I am conscious that there is. no longer a sense of urgency or pressure to get married nowadays, especially for the woman.
That's true. With women being trained for a variety of careers and becoming self-supporting, they do not feel the need to rush into marriage. However, those who wait too long, and have their children late, sometimes find there is a generation gap between them and their offspring. Younger parents are apt﻿61
MM: (cont) to b.e more resilient, while older parents are apt to be more nervous and possibly less patient.
ER: I was watching the "Today Show" on TV last Wednesday, and a child specialist said younger parents have more energy, but older parents in many instances have more patience.
MM: Really?
ER: Yes.
MM: That surprises me.
ER: Apparently this is a new and very popular view.
MM: I wonder how much older these parents are.
ER: And how much patience they have.
MM: Yes, that's right.
ER: Let's talk a bit about religion. Was that an important part of your life—religion and the church?
MM: Yes, religion and the church have been and still are an important part of my
life. My mother was the real spiritual leader in our family, and was descended from several generations of Episcopalians. Her family attended the white Episcopal church in Pensacola, until a Negro church was organized about two years before our family moved to California. After attending Saint Paul's Cathedral (white) in downtown Los Angeles for several months, my mother was persuaded by Mrs. Maggie Sanford to help found Saint Philip's, a Negro Episcopal Mission. When Reverend T.C. Marshall (white) conducted the first service on October 6, 1907, Mrs. Reuben H. Matthews and Mr. Cyril Gish were the only Negroes present, since Mrs. Sanford was attending her daughter's wedding in Texas. Mr. E.L. Chew, a graduate of Gammon Theological Seminary in Atlanta, conducted services at Scott's Hall until the arrival of Reverend W.T. Cleghorn, February 1, 1910. Two church buildings were built for Saint Philip's during his administration, which lasted until his death in 1932. My mother was the first organist for Saint Philip's, and performed this service for a number of years. Of the three children in our family, I was the most faithful in attending church; also taught Sunday school for almost thirty years at Saint Philip's and Saint Matthias's Episcopal Churches. Beginning in 1927, I served for several years as president of the Young People's Fellowship League at Saint Philip's Church. In the 1950s I was, a memb er of the Department of Christian Social Relations of the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles, serving as a resource person on race relations. In conclusion, I must say that my faith has sustained me in good times and bad, and I would he lost without it.
In reading your background in preparation for these sessions, I counted no less than thirty-three public service and community organizations that you belonged to. It's quite astounding. Can you tell me a bit about your public service?
I always managed to keep involved in a variety of community projects. This,﻿62
MM: (cont) I felt, was both a privilege and a responsibility, and X hope helped
to increase the quality of life in the communities where I lived or worked. My work on the executive boards of the South Central, Watts, and Exposition Community Co-ordinating Councils, from 1934-1960, brought me into close contact with all the community social agencies, including the schools. All these agencies, which included the public library, worked as a unit to help prevent juvenile delinquency, and to improve general conditions in the various neighborhoods. In 1935, I was the youngest featured speaker at the annual convention of the Los_ Angel es. County Community Coordinating Councils. When I retired from the Exposition Co-ordinating Council in 1960, after having served that body as president, vice-president and treasurer, I received a special citation from the Los Angeles. County Board of Supervisors for outstanding community service with the coordinating councils over a period of twenty-six years.
ER: A much-deserved honor, I'm sure.
ife Thank you. Shortly after I finished college, I served on the advisory boardb of the National Intercollegiate Christian Council and the National Youth Administration, and was a member of the Los Angeles County Youth Commission, as an appointee of Supervisor Gordon McDonough. Later, I was a member of the California Citizenship Education Advisory Council; Secondary Curriculum Committee of the Los Angeles City schools; advisory committee of the Los Angeles County Tuberculosis Association; executive board of Dr. Ruth Temple's Community Health Association, which began back in the thirties; executive committee of Operation Womanpower, an association of women's organizations from all over the country; and secretary of the Los Angeles Street Lighting Committee. I was appointed to the Los Angeles Birthday Fiesta Committee, by Mayor Norris Poulson; the Mayor's Community Advisory Committee, by Mayor Sam Yorty; the Los Angeles Bicentennial Committee, by Mayor Tom Bradley; the California Heritage Preservation Commission and the California State Historic Records Advisory Board, by Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. At present I hold life memberships in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the National Council of Negro Women, the American Library Association, Los Angeles High School Alumni Association, the University of California Alumni Association, the University of California Library School Alumni Association, the University of Chicago Alumni Association, and the Sojourner Truth Industrial Club. A founding member of the Los Angeles Civic League, the Los Angeles chapter of The Links, Inc., and the League of Allied Arts; also Pi chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. I am a member of the Southern California Executive Committee of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, Inc., a member of the American Association of University Women, the Los Angeles Urban League, the Society of American Archivists, the Society of California Archivists, Western History Association, Historical Society of Southern California, San Diego Historical Society, and California Historical Society.
I want to move on now to your professional associations and affiliations which are as impressive, if not more so, than your community and public service involvement. Could you tell us a bit about your professional affiliations?
From 1929 to 1935, I was a radio book reviewer for the Los Angeles Public Library on two leading radio stations, KHJ and KFI. After regular broadcasts by library staff members assigned to this project were discontinued, due to the reduction of public service programs by the radio stations, I did several broadcasts spon-﻿63
MM: (cont) sored by community institutions. The Independent Church was the sponsor of one program, on which I appealed to the public to support a library bond issue. Later, Miss Gladys English, head of the department of Work with Children secured a spot for a special half-hour children's broadcast, and asked me to do the program. She said, "Everyone knows you have the best voice for radio in the whole library."
ER: Terrific!
MM: I served as secretary for the Los Angeles Public Library Forum Committee,
representative for the branch librarians on various LAPL administrative committees, chairman of a conference leadership group to develop special projects within the library, and vice-president of the University of Chicago Graduate Library School Alumni Association. My work with the American Library Association Council and the Intellectual Freedom Committees of the American and California Library Associations has already been covered in some detail. In 1950 I server? on the semination cowntttee of the California Library Association. My appearances on convention programs in California and across the nation led to invitations to be considered for president of the American Library Association, vice-president of the California Library Association, chairman of the American Library Association Intellectual Freedom Committee, and two other California Library Association committees, all of which I declined due to a heavy work load. An invitation was extended to me, also, to consider accepting the post of city librarian of the San Mateo Public Library, but I preferred to stay in Los Angeles since I planned on an early retirement. Since my retirement in 1960, I have been secretary and a member of the executive board of the Friends of the Los Angeles Public Library; a resource person on California black history for the Southern California Answering Network, involving most of the libraries in Southern California, and served with the Southern California Committee on Library Cooperation, interviewing all the heads of libraries in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties to get their views on how to give better service at less cost through cooperation.
ER: A most impressive record!
MM: The year following my retirement I was the secretary and mainstay for the Los Angeles Street Lighting Committee, which was organized by Winifred Smith. I made contacts with the head of the Los Angel es Street Lighting Bureau and the City Council committees having jurisdiction over public works, trying to convince them that well-lighted streets would lower the crime rate, provide greater safety for all citizens, and lessen the need for increasing the police force.
ER: About five years ago law enforcement officials across the nation started a campaign to get people to turn on their lights...
^M: Yes, the Los Angeles County sheriff's office launched a campaign here, using
TV, radio, and the press, to get residents to turn on their front porch lights at night, and to keep lights on in strategic places inside their homes. Although our Street Lighting Committee received good publicity from TV and the press, and the members of the City Council admitted the importance of improved street lighting, they said funds were not available to accelerate the regular street lighting program.﻿64
ER: Throughout all of these various activities, many of them related to your work, you somehow found time to author many works. I'm amazed. Let's see, several of them are on race relations and blacks in California. Tell us a bit about your writings.
MM: I must confess that most of the listed items were published in various journals, except my master's thesis, "Library Activities in the Field of Race Relations," a survey of forty-five libraries in twenty-four states and the District of Columbia, and "The Negro in California, 1781-1910: An Annotated Bibliography," compiled for a research course at the University of Southern California in 1944. The latter is an unpublished manuscript, which has been used by a number of scholars at the Doheny Library at University of Southern California, and the Bancroft Library at the University of California in Berkeley. Members of the staff at the American Library Association headquarters in Chicago urged me to prepare two magazine articles based on my master's thesis, which they offered to send to leading publications such as Harper's and the Atlantic Monthly. Returning to a new position in Los Angeles after a year's leave of absence, the pressures were too great, and I did not find time to write the articles. "Race Relations on the Pacific Coast: A Select Bibliography" appeared in a special issue of the Journal of Educational Sociology, November 1945, devoted to wartime conditions for blacks in the major west coast cities—Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; San Francisco and Los Angeles, California. "William Grant Still: Composer" was the twenty-third in a series of biographies or profiles published in Phylon: The Atlanta University Review of Race and Culture (1951) . Mr. and Mrs. Will iam Grant Still, who are close personal friends of mine, were asked by the editor of Phylon to suggest two persons to write the Still profile. I was greatly surprised and flattered when I was selected, instead of the prominent editor of a national musical journal. Although the Stills were very pleased with my article, they, too, expected the editor to choose the musical expert. "An Example of What One Library Can Do," published in the Journal of the National Association of College Women (1936) was based on a speech I gave at the convention of Los Angeles Community Coordinating Councils titled, "The Library as a Social Force in the Community." "Improving the Book Collection: Quality Through 'Weeding'," published in the California Librarian (1959) and the Oklahoma Librarian (1961), was presented first at two library workshops at the University of Southern California and the University of California, San Diego, in the spring of 1959. Mary Murdock, city librarian of the South Pasadena Public Library, and I wrote companion papers on this subject. The subtitle of my paper was "Weeding in Principle" and hers was "Weeding in Practice." Requests for reprints of these papers were received from libraries on three continents. Apparently many institutions considered improving their book collections through "weeding" to be a very important subject.
What are your plans for future publications? Are there any works in progress?
Some years ago the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company offered to publish my annotated bibliography of "The Negro in California, 1781-1910" after I revised and enlarged it. However, instead of stopping to prepare a first edition for the publishers, I continued to collect material, which is an endless process. In addition to publishing the bibliography, I hope to go to press soon with a pictorial history of blacks in California, which I expect will appeal to the general public.
ER:
You are credited with being the first person in Los Angeles to stimulate an﻿65

ER: MM:
As a member of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, I was impressed with Dir. Carter G, Woodson's campaign, initiated in 1926 for the celebration of Negro History Week during the second week in February. Since there was no activity in Los Angeles, not even a single notice in any of the Negro newspapers, I decided in 1929 to try to stir up some interest here. First, I wrote articles for the local Negro press, announcing the February dates for the celebration, explaining the program, and the use of special Negro History Week kits which could be ordered from the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History in Washington, D.C. Stressing the importance of everyone knowing something about Negro history, I published reviews of books on the subject which could be borrowed from local branch libraries, and also featured reviews on the subject at the Helen Hunt Jackson Library Book Club, which I organized in 1929. Rare books and pamphlets on the Negro were borrowed from collectors for library exhibitions; also art produced by Negro artists. I gave talks on Negro history and race relations to school classes and community organizations, both black and white, in various parts of the city. I'm a firm believer that Negro history is not just for blacks but for everyone.
In about two years there was widespread interest in Los Angeles in the celebration of Negro History Week. It was no longer necessary for me to remind the local newspapers several months in advance to advertise the dates for the upcoming Negro History Week celebration. Eventually a Los Angeles chapter of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History was organized by William Easter, an adult education supervisor for the California State department of Education. At the request of the local chapter, the mayor of Los Angeles issued an official proclamation for a city-wide observance of Negro History Week.
My compliments on your success in this area. I understand you were state membership chairman of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (now changed to Afro-American Life and History). What was your role in that?
My role was to get as many new members as possible, to capture a wider audience to support the work of the association. In his letter appointing me state membership chairman for California, Dr. Woodson indicated he wished to increase memberships by the thousands all over the country. I made a special appeal to teachers. Many of them joined, sharing their literature from the association with their students, and created a great interest in black studies decades before the national trend in this field in the 1960s. The Vernon branch library, which I headed at this time, became the center for bulk mailings of the Negro History Bulletin, since it reduced the cost and was a convenient pickup point for the schoolteachers in the district.
You have a large personal collection of books, pictures and documents dealing with blacks in California. Will you discuss that collection with us?
I have been collecting books on the Negro in America for a number of years. Those on the Negro in California and the West belong to more recent dates. For a long time, the only book on the Negro in California, that is, entirely devoted to the subject, was Delilah Beasley's The Negro Trailblazers of California, published in 1919. It is an excellent source book although it~lacks an index. Those using it for research purposes may consult an index on catalog﻿66
(cont) cards in the history department of the Los Angeles Public Library in downtown Los Angeles.
After my retirement in 1960, I concentrated on collecting photographs and copies of original documents from pioneer black families, and continued to add to my collection from museums, libraries and historical societies. It was my good fortune to get several hundred excellent photographs on the Negro in Los Angeles, including many notable figures and celebrities, from Harry H. Adams, a news photographer for the Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper, when he was clearing out his files for a move to smaller quarters. This collecting hobby of mine is fascinating and might be compared to a treasure hunt. I'm delighted when I make a rich find and frustrated when I arrive just a little too late. One day I phoned an old friend to get some material on his father, an early black contractor who built some important buildings in downtown Los Angeles before 1920, only to learn that three weeks earlier he had dumped all his father's papers which were stored in his old rolltop desk, because someone wished to buy the desk, which he sold for only ten dollars!
I understand that authors and scholars from all across the country have had occasion to contact you for information in your files and that you've been credited in several works for...
Yes, that's true. A number of friends have referred people to me who are interested in information on the Negro in California. Many of these referrals have come from James Abajian, who is well known for his research in this field, too. For twenty years he was librarian for the California Historical Society in San Francisco. In the last few years he has published two important works: Blacks and Their Contributions to the American West: A Bibliography and Union List of Library Holdings Through 1970, and Blacks in Selected Newspapers, Censuses and 0ther Sources: An Index to Names and Subjects (1977). In his acknowledgements in the first volume listed above, Abajian wrote: "Miriam Matthews, recently retired from her position as administrator in the Los Angeles Public Library system, has been a foremost authority on California black bibliography since her own annotated work was completed at the University of Southern California in 1944. Consistent with her enthusiastic dedication to her professional field, Miss Matthews twice opened her impressive personal library for the compiler's use, and also made available to the project the results of her own bibliographical collecting."

ER: You have an extensive and one of the most beautiful private art collections I have ever been privileged to view.
MM: I'm flattered to hear you say that.
ER: I love it. It takes my breath away. I understand many of the works in your collection are by local black artists, some of whom you sponsored. Will you tell us a bit about the collection and some of the artists?
MM: Although I started helping artists in the mid-thirties, the bulk of my art collection has been built up since I retired in 1960. When the Los Angeles Negro Art Association, the first of its kind in this city, was organized in 1937 to help promote local Negro artists, I served on its executive board. The first important public function it sponsored was an exhibition held in the fall of 1937 at the Stendahl Art Gallery on Wilshire Boulevard, which was opened with an elaborately beautiful reception. Beulah Woodard was responsible for securing the gallery and the prizes, while I made all the arrangements for the reception and sending out the invitations. It was a very successful showing and attracted a large number of visitors while it was on display. Annual exhibitions were held in different locations in the years that followed.
Since the work of Negro artists was rarely hung in white galleries, and they had no galleries of their own, eleven black artists banded together in 1950 to open an interracial Eleven Associated Artists' Gallery in downtown Los Angeles. A dozen laymen formed a board of directors, and Beulah Woodard, sculptor, accepted the demanding post of gallery director, receiving no compensation and spending her own money for incidental expenses. The artists donated small items to be sold at a gift shop on the balcony to help defray expenses, but there was rarely enough to cover everything. Only juried shows were hung in the gallery, and artists of every race and creed were permitted to submit their work. Exhibitions were changed every month or two until the gallery closed during its second year, due to a broken pipe inside one of the walls. Since no suitable space could be found with affordable rent, the gallery was not relocated. However, during its short existence, it did set an example and leave its mark on the artistic community of Los Angeles. I neglected to add that I was one of the "working" directors.
ER: Both of the organizations you have mentioned certainly blazed a trail in this city for today's black artists.
MM: They did, indeed. Beulah Woodard, a black sculptor, was the first artist I
helped back in 1935. An exhibition of Beulah Woodard's work, which I arranged at the Vernon branch library, led to a one-man show at the Los Angeles County Museum in Exposition Park, a first for a black artist, and a fact that is little known today. The metropolitan newspapers headlined this event and gave it wide coverage. Not only was Beulah Woodard an excellent artist, she was a born﻿68
MM: (cont) leader also, who gave unselfishly of her time to help Negro artists as
a group. Unfortunately, she did not receive the full recognition she deserved, and died in 1955 a few months after she received an invitation to exhibit her work in Germany, which might have given her the extra thrust to put her on top. Mrs. Woodard devoted much of her art to the preservation of different types of Africans. I'm proud of the dozen Woodard sculptures in my collection, which include a stone bust of my nephew, Chuck, at the age of three, which I commissioned her to do. One day soon I hope to revise and publish the biography of this fine artist, which I wrote to send to Germany with the photograph album of her work. Included with her album, also, was this very fine tribute by Arthur Millier, Los Angeles Times art critic:
First and last Beulah Woodard is a sculptor of humanity. Her theme is mankind and she finds it in every man, woman and child, in members of every race and tribe. If questions of artistic style ever troubled her, no sign of it appears in her work. She appears to mold clay or carve wood with the single aim of expressing what she feels. In consequence, uer African tribal heads and figures go beyond the reproduction of physical characteristics peculiar to a group. They transcend anthropological reporting. They show us people who live, think, experience joy and suffering as do all men, whatever their race or condition. This innate sympathy for the humanness in man gives Mrs. Woodard's sculpture universality. The specific portrait of a public official, the sympathetic study of a poor boy, the precise depiction of a racial type or the generalized carving into wood of the lineaments of sorrow share this quality. In the broadest sense this artist is a sculptor of humanity.
ER: What a beautiful, moving tribute!
MM: Alice Taylor Gafford, the dean of black artists in this city, put away her paint brushes for the last time shortly before her eighty-ninth birthday in 1975. Winner of more than twenty-five awards and citations, her work now hangs in public and private collections on three continents. Her art career began at age forty-nine, after working more than twenty-five years as a professional nurse. She worked at two careers until 1951, when she entered the University of California at Los Angeles to earn her art teaching credentials at age sixty-five, thus adding a third career to her list. Five years later the artist decided to devote all of her time to her creative work. On her eighty-first birthday, Mrs. Gafford received a commission from the Family Savings and Loan Association in Los Angeles to paint portraits of twelve famous Negro-Americans for its permanent gallery. These paintings brought her widespread publicity in newspapers throughout the area, including Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Mrs. Gafford was a versatile and prolific artist working in several media until the last half of her art career, when she concentrated on oil painting and favored still life studies.
Organized in the Saugus area in 1946, the Val Verde Art and Hobby Show (later renamed the Alice T. Gafford Art and Hobby Show) was the brainchild of the artist who directed the show for twenty years. Mrs. Gafford was a member of a number of art associations, including several she helped found, also the Eleven Associated Artists'Gallery. Her work and biography are included in volume two of Blatk Artists on Art, by Samella S. Lewis and Ruth G. Waddy; The Otis Story: Otis Art Institute since 1918, by Mary Jarrett; and American﻿69

As her sponsor and unpaid agent, I arranged Alice T. Gafford's first one-man show in 1941, also many other group and one-man exhibitions in the years that followed, until her recent retirement in 1975. In addition to handling her exhibitions, I took care of her publicity, promotion and sales, and succeeded in placing her work in the permanent collections of museums and universities across the country. Moreover, I was the largest purchaser of her works. Gafford paintings are hanging in every room of my house and in the homes of my relatives as well.
ER: You were truly a great friend to these two artists.
MM: We enjoyed a warm friendship which enriched me, too. Moreover, I learned a great deal about art from both of them. For shorter periods of time I helped a few other black artists, too. Others offered me commissions to sponsor them, but I had my hands full and could not take on any more. Today, I help them principally by purchasing their art and displaying it in my home. The walls in every room in my home, including the hall, kitchen and service porch, are loaded with prints and paintings. The extras are stored in boxes in the closets and under the beds.
ER: This is adequate proof that you are a real patron of the arts.
MM: This might be a good time for me to mention the names of other black artists in my collection, some of whom are not Californians. Several of the local artists listed here enjoy a national or international reputation in the art world. The list includes Henry Ossawa Tanner, Charles White, Romare Bearden, John Biggers, Herman Kofi Bailey, Elizabeth Catlett, William Pajaud, John Riddle, Alvin C. Hollingsworth, William E. Smith, Betty Saar, Curtis Tann, David Bradford, Barbara Wesson, Alonzo Davis, P'lla Mills, Ron Adams, Yvonne Meo, Leo Thompson, Eugene Hawkins, Dan Concholar, Samella Lewis, Fred Wilson, Leon Leonard, Vertis Hayes, Ruth Waddy, Bernard Wright, Van Slater, Lee Comp-ton, Marion Epting, Gloria Bohanan, Claude Cleveland, John W. Outterbridge, Brent Bailer, Pauline Powell Burns, and many more.
ER: Miss Matthews, you've traveled to places most people dream about—Europe,
Central and South America, Mexico, Canada and the Orient. I was wondering, would you discuss some of those travels and perhaps an adventure or two?
MM: I shall be happy to. My first trip outside California was to Canada with the family, just after I graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in May, 1926. Vancouver and Victoria were very British at that time, and we sometimes had difficulty understanding the people we asked for directions. It was a new experience for us, but we had a lot of fun. In 1930 my sister, Ella, and I took an eight-week train trip to the East Coast, stopping in Kansas City, Chicago and Detroit to visit relatives before moving on to New York, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. It was exciting to see all the big cities we had heard so much about, especially New York, but we were shocked to learn firsthand about discrimination and segregation in our nation's capital. We returned home through the Canadian Rockies, viewing breathtaking scenery from a glass-topped observation car. When I spent six months in New York City ten years later, I returned to Los Angeles via Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; Washington, D.C. (where I was the house guest of﻿70
MM: (cort) Dr. and Mrs. Ralph J. Bunche); Pensacola, Florida (where I visited
an aunt); and New Orleans, Louisiana (where friends gave me my first tour of this fabulous city). After attending the American Library Association convention in Atlantic City in 1948, three librarian friends and I motored through New England and eastern Canada making stops in Quebec, Ottawa, Toronto, Montreal and Niagara Falls. Although we were delighted with all the places, we visited Quebec in French Canada with its quaint old world customs, and it proved to be the highlight of our three-week trip.
In 1952, I flew to Mexico City where I joined the Lester Nicholas and Albert Baumann families who had motored there from Los Angeles. We drove to the east and west coasts of Mexico, viewing spectacular scenery all the way. Mexico is a beautiful, exciting country with its population revealing a mixture of Indian, Spanish and African blood. Vera Cruz was of special interest to me because the African heritage of many of its residents was so evident. I flew home from Guadalajara.
ER: Where did you go next?
MM: Three years later in 1955, I traveled through thirteen European countries on
a ten-week vacation visiting Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Holland, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Scotland and England. Often I was asked which I enjoyed most, but I found I could not make a choice. I loved them all! Following the advice of a friend, I had the travel agent prepare an independent itinerary for me, arranging escort service from the airports and railway stations to my hotels and back again upon my departure. This \ allowed me greater flexibility than a tour, and I was able to do the things which interested me most. Of course, I took the usual city bus tours so I could get to the important places quickly and learn the layout of each city; then I would explore on my own.
On my last evening in Stockholm, Sweden, I went to an historic park on the bus. The admission fee was very nominal, and almost everything in the park was free except food. First, I visited an area where there was a village with the church, houses and other buildings either preserved or restored just as they were centuries ago. I arrived at the quaint little church just as the evening service was starting. The choir was excellent, and the minister so dynamic I imagined I knew what he was saying, even though I didn't understand Swedish. From the church I wandered to a square where native dances were being performed by a group dressed in colorful costumes. At my next stop, a large open-air theatre, a varied and interesting program was being presented. It was still in progress when I left to get dinner in an adjacent restaurant. Before I had time to place my order, a famous opera star began singing in the outdoor theatre. He had a tremendous voice like a Caruso. They opened the huge picture windows overlooking the theatre so everyone could hear. The patrons seated near the windows must have been freezing because a storm was gathering. During the half-hour concert given by the artist you could have heard a pin drop. The waiters served no one and none of the guests lifted a fork. That shows you their real appreciation for beautiful art and music. It was heavenly. I wouldn't take a million dollars for i ust that part of the evening. The next day I met some people on the train who had stayed at my hotel. When I told them what I had done the night before they said, "Oh, we wish we had been with you. We were just sitting at the hotel bored to death." Unless I was completely exhausted, which happened rarely, I was always looking for something to do.﻿71
ER: Apparently you were a very enterprising traveler who made every moment count.
MM: In Oslo, Norway, I planned to visit the city hall and then attend a movie. Contrary to the advice I had been given, the city hall was not open that evening, and I would have had to wait two hours for the next showing of the film I went to see. Disappointed, I decided to go to see The Merry Widow which was opening that night. When I arrived at the opera house at 7:30 p.m., the box office was closed. Just as I was leaving, a woman who took care of the refreshment stand came out of the theatre and informed me that on opening night performances always begin at seven o'clock. When she learned I was a visitor and leaving the next day, she offered me a ticket she was holding for a friend of someone inside, saying she was slightly pregnant. She said I could pay the woman for the ticket. The usher seated me in the dark. As soon as the lights were turned up for the intermission, a young slender girl next to me hurried out with her boyfriend. They returned just before curtain time, and I learned the ticket I had been given did not belong to her. After she looked at my ticket, she said it was on the other side of the house. After the final curtain I rushed out so the "refreshment" lady could point out the slightly pregnant woman, but she had closed up her stand and left. It was a grand production of The Merry Widow — magnificent voices, beautiful costumes and scenery. So I had a perf ectly delightful evening at no cost to me.
Although I did not get up into the Arctic Circle in Norway-r-the Land of the Midnight Sun—where there is almost constant daylight from April to mid-September, I did experience nights with only two to four hours darkness. Hotels had heavy drapes so the light would not keep one awake. I traveled by boat through some of the Norwegian fjords and then up into the mountains to see some breathtaking scenery. A couple from New England and I were the only tourists on this part of the trip, and we enjoyed each other's company very much. We shared our boat ride with a class of young children accompanied by their schoolteacher. I was seldom alone throughout Europe because I met a number of friendly couples or women who were traveling alone. In some cases warm friendships developed, and we corresponded after returning to our respective homes.
!R: I think that's how I'd like to travel. I always said I'd like to travel alone, but I really don't have the nerve to do that.
M: All through Europe I traveled in the daytime by train or bus so I could enjoy the scenery along the way. In Germany I took a boat trip down the Rhine. When I left Lucerne, Switzerland, the train skirted beautiful lakes with snowcapped mountains rising majestically behind them. From Edinburgh, Scotland, to London I traveled by bus through the English lake country, stopping to see Stratford-On-Avon, the birthplace of William Shakespeare. Naturally I visited Westminster Abbey, the British Museum, the Tower of London, and Buckingham Palace while I was in London. Also, I attended a number of legitimate theatres, viewing as many as three plays in one day. If you wished refreshments during the intermission, you notified the usher before the play began. During intermission you were served at your seat a tray with dainty sandwiches, cake and tea, all for the sum of twenty-five cents. On my last day in London I bumped into a woman from Chile (a transplanted German!) who had traveled all through Italy with me during the early part of my trip. She hugged me and greeted me so cordially you would have thought we were very old friends. We spent the entire day together.﻿72
MM: (cont) My last stop was Paris, where I spent nine wonderful days taking side trips to the B.ois de Boulogne, Versailles and Fontainebleau. I attended the opera and the Comedie Francaise, world famous theatre; also Les Folies Bergere. The Louvre was my favorite museum which I visited more than once. It was my good fortune one evening to attend a lovely performance of the opera-ballet, Romeo and Juliet, in the gardens outside the Louvre. The setting out-of-doors gave it a fairylike quality. The cast was made up of leading artists from almost every country in Europe. It was unforgettable!
It would take hours and hours to recount all the exciting adventures I had in Europe. Needless to say, when I returned to Los Angeles on July third, I brought with me many happy memories.
ER: I do not doubt it. Now tell us about your South American trip.
MM: Following my retirement I spent four months in 1962, traveling through every country in Central and South America (except Bolivia) and selected islands in the Caribbean, as well as Mexico and Yucatan. The seasons in South America are the reverse of ours in the United States.. When I arrived in the month of April, it was their fall season. Their spring begins in September and their summer in December. I had to pack clothing for all seasons. Central America and Brazil were hot, while the countries at the lower end of the continent were cold. I almost froze going through the lake country in Chile and Argentina. Although it had been many years since I studied Spanish in college, I did become rather fluent as my trip progressed, which added a great deal to my enjoyment of the people. Every country was delightful, so as in Europe it was difficult for me to select my favorite one.
Peru was especially interesting because of the awe-inspiring Inca ruins at Cuzco and Machu Picchu. I shared my trip there with an Argentinian couple and a young school teacher who were delightful. When we left Lima to fly over the high Andes Mountains to Cuzco, the steward made everyone put on an oxygen mask as a precautionary measure. After our arrival in Cuzco, we were advised to remain in our hotels for several hours to rest and get accustomed to the high altitude. The day after we toured the ruins at Cuzco, we took a "train—bus" still higher in the mountains to Machu Picchu, a mountaintop sanctuary formerly used by the Inca rulers in times of distress. It was so well hidden that its existence apparently was not known until Hiram Bingham, an American, discovered it in 1911. The well-built ruins include temples, houses, a cemetery and a strangely cut stone alter.
My most thrilling experience in South America occurred at Iguassu Falls, one of the most magnificent sights in the world. These falls extend two and a half miles down a gorge and there are 275 separate cataracts. They are greater than the Niagara or Victor ia Falls. The Iguassu Falls border on three countries, Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay. The Hotel Cataratas on the Brazilian side where I stayed is the best in the area. My first day there was beautiful and sunny, and I enjoyed the view of the falls with some of my fellow travelers from several vantage points.
A number of the hotel guests had signed up for a trip to Devil's Gorge, but the guide could not take us that day because the river was too high. On the﻿73
MM: (cont) second day a Mr. Smith and I were the only two remaining guests. Since the weather was foggy and overcast, we were surprised when the guide told us to get into his station wagon. When we reached the dock, the weather was clear. The guide put us in a small rowboat that was chained to the dock and rowed us out to the middle of the river where there was a big pile of large rocks. After he chained the rowboat the guide led us over the boulders on a catwalk. On the other side he put us into another rowboat, unchained it and started rowing across the currents towards the falls. He had to skirt around large rocks all the way, which made us realize why he could not attempt this trip when the river was high. After a while all the currents appeared to be pulling us to the edge of the falls, and there seemed to be no way to keep from going over. Suddenly we stopped at the edge of a huge flat boulder, large enough to accommodate a number of people. When we got out of the boat, we were standing next to the largest falls, watching tons and tons of water crashing down endlessly. Then we looked all the way down the gorge at all the other cataracts extending as far as the eye could see. It was a sight I'll never forget. It made me feel very close to God. Only He could have created such grandeur. After we returned to the rocks in the middle of the river and transferred to the second boat, it began to rain. The guide took off his leather jacket to allow himself greater freedom of movement. With the rain obscuring his view, he had to be extremely careful not to hit a rock. One slip of his oar and we were doomed. I prayed all the way to the dock. Had I known how dangerous the trip to Devil's Gorge was, I might not have gone, and would have missed one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.
After I had been down the west coast and up the east coast of South America, Chuck, my fourteen-year-old nephew who had just graduated from Saint John's Military Academy, joined me at Trinidad, my first stop in the Caribbean. The highlight of our stay in Trinidad was the performance we saw of an excellent steel band, famous Calypso singers, and some agile dancers who managed to dance under some extremely low bars without using their hands. Some of the bars were on fire! We had one city tour in Trinidad which Chuck found tiring, even though we did very little walking. I told Chuck he acted like he was my age and I was more like his age in terms of energy. What he enjoyed most when he started on the trip was swimming. In view of this initial experience with Chuck, I was apprehensive about the stops on our itinerary where numerous trips were scheduled. However, Chuck soon developed an interest in the things we were seeing everywhere—in Tobago, Curasao, Caracas, Haiti, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Jamaica—and actually enjoyed walking. In Curasao he was amazed to discover that practically everyone, no matter how lowly his station in life, spoke three languages. He said, "I only speak English and not even that perfectly." Chuck and I were most impressed with the incredible mountaintop Citadel built early in the nineteenth century by Henri Christophe, a Negro revolutionary leader who declared himself king of Haiti in 1811. It was a tough two-hour climb on horseback to the Citadel, but well worth it to see what remains of that impregnable fortress. Every stone and cannon was dragged up the mountain by the sheer manpower of 200,000 men, many of whcrm died during the thirteen years it took to build it. There were enough supplies originally for 15,000 soldiers to withstand a year's siege.
ER: I remember how impressed I was reading about Negroes in Haiti under the command of Toussaint L'Ouverture and later under Henri Christophe, defeating French troops with superior training and equipment, to win the complete﻿74
ER: (ccmt) independence of Haiti by 1804.
MM: This is a remarkable achievement that Negroes can point to with pride, especially when talking to whites who believe Negroes had neither the will nor
the ability to fight for and win their own freedom.
By the time we arrived in Yucatan, Mexico, Chuck had matured considerably and was a seasoned traveler. After our first day visiting the ruins there, we met a family from New York with a fourteen-year-old son who were staying at our hotel. The parents asked if I thought they should take the tours we had had that day, or go on the jungle trip we were taking the next day. After I told them what we had seen, Chuck spoke up and added several things I had forgotten to mention. I was surprised how much he had remembered, because he was busy taking pictures, and appeared not to be listening to the guide half the time. Incidentally, the father and son went with us the next day on the jungle trip and we had a very good time. One day we climbed to the top of a flight of stairs inside a nv^id to see an old idol. When our group was ready to leave, the guide asked where Chuck was. After we went outside we discovered that Chuck already had climbed clear to the top of the pyramid outside! Another couple we met in Yucatan had all their meals with us and traveled with us to Mexico City where we met my brother. Then we went to see the archaeological site at Monte Alban and the picturesque city market at nearby Oaxaca. My brother, Charles, bought several finely woven blankets and enjoyed bargaining for them. While he and Chuck went to Cuernavaca, Taxco and Acapulco, I stayed in Mexico City to shop and do the theatres and restaurants. When we returned home in mid-August, I was still going strong and could have continued traveling for another four months.
ER: What a traveler!
MM: My last important trip was a visit to Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong in 1971. For the first time I traveled with a group, but the fourteen people were all hand-picked by our leaders, Reverend and Mrs. John McMullen, who had lived in Japan sixteen years, knew the language and had many contacts there. John has a wonderful sense of humor and kept our party in good spirits all the way. We stayed in Japanese inns, rode on the Japanese superexpress trains, and visited places the average tourist never sees. The first Japanese inn where we stopped was very elegant with special appointments inside and beautiful gardens outside. John had to beg them to let sixteen Americans stay there, because none of their help could speak English, and so often Americans do not respect their customs about taking off their shoes and so forth.
ER: The ugly American.
MM: Yes. However, John finally convinced them we were not of that breed, that we
had attended briefing sessions on their customs before leaving America, and that he and his wife would translate for us. Then they consented to take us.
ER: Now this inn where you were staying, they didn't want you to have your shoes on there?
Oh no. At any typical Japanese place, whether it's a private home, an inn or a museum, you take off your street shoes and leave them at the door, and put on slippers which are provided for you. John wanted us to see how the Japanese live.﻿75
MM: (cont) Perhaps I shouldn't mention this on tape, but the commodes are very low and you have to squat to use them. Don't stay in a Japanese inn if you are not in good shape!
ER: Or too tired to get back up, eh?
MM- That's right. It was almost dinner time when we arrived at this inn. First we had a bath. The community bath at this inn looked like a huge grotto in the woods carved out of rock. It was amazingly realistic. All the women bathed together, and everyone took a sponge bath before getting in a huge pool of hot water to soak. You have no idea how delightfully relaxed you feel after such an experience. All of the guests are given kimonos to wear (both the men and the women), which we wore to dinner. The inner rooms where you eat and sleep the floors are covered with tatami (a strawlike carpeting). Before entering these rooms, you remove your slippers and walk in your stocking feet. Meals are served on low tables set up in a row, and the guests sit on pillows to eat, Tbp Japanese sit on their knees with their legs tucked under them. Most Americans cannot hold that position very long, so we had our feet under the table usually touching those of the person across from us. We were served regular Japanese food, including the raw fish. Most of us enjoyed everything, but a few passed their raw fish along to those who loved it.
ER: I believe I would skip the raw fish myself.
MM- When it was time to retire, they made up our beds on the floor—a thin mattress, sheets, lightweight quilts and a small pillow filled with rice. At this first inn from two to five occupied one room, but at an inn we visited later on the trip, ten women were in one room. We had wall-to-wall beds. I was the last one returning from the bath room, and they had already turned off the lights. My bed was at the other end of the room from the door, and I probably would have stepped in someone's face trying to get through in the dark, if one of the women had not had a flashlight which she turned on to guide me.
ER: What an experience!
MM:
Naturally we saw many of the outstanding sights in Japan, like the Great Buddha in Kamakura, but I shall comment on the things we did that were different. We were invited to the home of a highborn Japanese family (John knew the son), whose home was a national treasure. They were friends of the Emperor of Japan, who had given them a gate and a stone lantern from his personal garden. We were shown many of their family heirlooms — fine porcelains, paintings and so forth The grandmother even did a ceremonial dance for us. Next, we paid a visit'to the studio of one of Japan's famous sculptors, Harumi Matsubara, which was a rare experience. In addition to seeing studio-size examples of his work, he showed us his album with photographs of monumental works which occupy important places throughout Japan. I am proud of several small sculptures by this artist which I have added to my own collection. At the home of an outstanding Japanese potter whose family business dated back over two hundred years, we were privileged to see some of his most precious possessions, also.
On one occasion John arranged for each of us to stay overnight in a private home. I had the good fortune to stay with the family of a universtiy professor who taught English. The professor and his college-age son had to translate﻿76
MM: (cont) for the wife, who spoke no English at all. Dinner and breakfast were delicious, but they tried to overfeed me. A married daughter came over after dinner with an adorable five-year-old daughter of her own who looked like an angel. The professor gave me a book he had written on how to teach English to Japanese, and proudly showed me his extensive library, which included several sets of English encyclopedias. He was one of a small group of Japanese educators who had been selected to tour the United States to observe our methods of teaching Japanese in this country, and he was leaving the next day. Since it was to be his first visit to this country, he plied me with questions about what to expect. Needless to say, my visit with this family was a very delightful experience.
ER: I'm sure that added a very special dimension to your trip.
MM: Yes, it did. John had planned a free period for us so we could do a little exploring on our own. Most of the group traveled as individuals to other parts of Japan using a college student as a guide and translator. Three of us flew to Taiwan and Hong Kong. The National Palace Museum, which houses most of the treasures of China, was one of the major attractions in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. I could have spent days there. The Taroko Gorge in eastern Taiwan held us spellbound during a full day of traveling through varied and spectacular scenery.
While in Hong Kong we had a round-the-island tour which offered a medley of sights. We went to Aberdeen's city of sampans, residential Stanley and Repulse Bay. Also visited the bizarre Tiger Balm Gardens and drove through the wooded hills above the busy harbor. We took a fast boat to Macao, six square miles of Portuguese territory on the China mainland, which reveals to the visitor fifteenth century Portugal, eighteenth century China and twentieth century cosmopolitan, a curious and fascinating contrast since they are so close together. As you know, Hong Kong is a shopper's delight; therefore I spent a great deal of time shopping and picked up a number of good bargains—a Point Venice tablecloth, six-hand crocheted dresses, some small paintings and various art objects.
When the group reassembled in Tokyo, we put all of our purchases togther to be shipped to Los Angeles by container freight because it was less expensive that way. My shopping in Japan included half a dozen kimonos, some lovely old Japanese prints, a number of artifacts and a beautiful Japanese wedding coat, which I discovered recently dates back to 1871.
ER: I've seen the wedding coat and it's just gorgeous. You brought some jade and rose quartz pieces back from Japan, didn't you? Isn't that where you began...
MM: Actually I bought only one small piece of jade on that trip. My other jade
pieces were purchased at an antique show in Hollywood and the two rose quartz pieces at a shop in the Century Plaza Hotel in Century City. Since inflation is now a factor, I would advise anyone planning a trip anywhere in the world to shop at home first. Many of our imports cost only slightly more than they do in the country of origin, and then you have to pay duty, shipping and insurance charges. Of course, the items you are interested in may not be imported to America at all, then you will have to purchase them abroad. A year and a half after I returned from the Orient, my brother and his wife went there. Certain items I asked them to purchase for me to use as gifts had gone up in some cases﻿77
MM: (cont) as much as five hundred percent in that short time.
ER: I want to ask about your hobbies. I know you have a soft spot for antiques and of course, art. What are some of your other hobbies?
MM: Well, I have collected dolls in foreign dress. The first three, which I purchased in Mexico in 1952, were small but beautifully made with gorgeous costumes. I planned to use them in a glass display case at the library with some books on Mexico, and then give them to some children at Christmas time. One of my friends said, "They're too lovely to give to children. They will break them up in no time at all." So I kept them. When I went to Europe three years later, I shopped for dolls in every country I visited. After a while I discovered some lovely imports right here in Los Angeles. The doll collection is kept stored in boxes until I take them to a hobby show or use them for table decorations when I entertain in my home. It's amazing how they fascinate everyone, young and old.
ER: And you have a bell collection?
MM: Yes, I have a bell collection which was started by Alice T. Gafford, the artist I mentioned earlier. It was she who stimulated my interest in bells. I began looking for them as I browsed through antique shops and antique shows, also while traveling in foreign countries. I brought several rather unique bells from Japan, two of which were antique temple bells. A large old-fashioned display case is loaded with bells of every shape, size and material. Soon I shall have to begin storing them in boxes or buy another display case.
In addition to collecting art of all kinds, antiques, bells, dolls, books, historic pictures and documents, I like to bake cakes and dainty cookies which I make with a cookie press. A number of my friends are on my list to receive a birthday cake every year, and I bake cookies for children and parties. My pursuit of these hobbies adds up to quite a little time and a great deal of enjoyment. I neglected to mention that for many years I made some of my own clothes, but for the past nine years I have been too busy to indulge this hobby.
ER: Miss Matthews, despite all of your many activities I understand you have found time to socialize, too. Would you tell us something about your social life?
MM: Everyone knows the old saying, "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,"
meaning .we should have some balance in our lives. Although I have joined only one strictly social club, the Saturday Afternoon Bridge Club (which was organized as a'sewing circle back in 1926), I have always had a wide circle of friends with whom I exchanged social courtesies. These included all kinds of affairs--luncheons, bridge luncheons, breakfasts, picnics, barbecues, beach parties, dinners, receptions, tea parties, cocktail parties, formal and informal dances, dinner dances, theatre parties, concerts, operas and so forth. Today, when I entertain my bridge club in my home, I usually engage a caterer since my guest list often reaches fifty. Occasionally when my list is too long, I schedule two parties about a week apart. There are special parties of course, when good friends come to Los Angeles from out of town, I enjoy entertaining, and I feel social affairs add a little spice to life.
ER: I understand you and your brother, Charles, went to college with Dr. Ralph Bunche and remained good friends with him through the years.﻿78
MM: Yes, that's true. Ralph Bunche graduated from Jefferson High School in February, 1922, at the same time I finished Los Angeles High School. Both of us waited until the fall semester to register at the University of California, Southern Branch. An accident caused Ralph to go to the hospital during that first semester. Since he was working his way through college, he decided to wait until the next year to resume his studies, in order to pay his hospital bills and save a little money. That put him in the same class with my brother. Ralph was extremely popular at the university, and managed to find time for numerous extracurricular activities even though he had to work. He won honors in scholarship as well, and served as valedictorian when he graduated in 1927. Ralph was a frequent visitor at our home from high school days through college. We attended the same parties and often went together. When Charles and I went to the University of California at Berkeley in 1924, we corresponded frequently with Ralph until we returned to Los Angeles. A graduate scholarship to Harvard took Ralph east, where he remained to build his home and carve out an illustrious career as a world peacemaker. Although he rose to great heights, Ralph always remained the same. He was gracious and kind to everyone, but especially loyal to old friends. He always found Limt to phone my brother, even when he was flying into Los Angeles for only a few hours on United Nations business. When his wife, Ruth, accompanied him and there was more time, they would come to see us or invite us to their hotel. Charles fl ew east for his funeral when Ralph Bunche died. His passing was a great loss not only to his personal friends but to the world.
ER: You are a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, I am proud to say.
MM: Yes, I am.
ER: Can you tell us a bit about your involvement with the sorority?
MM: I was a charter member and first vice-president of Pi chapter, the first Delta chapter established in southern California in 1923. When I went to the University of California in Berkeley in 1924, I was elected president of Kappa chapter. After returning to Los Angeles I established Nu Sigma, a graduate chapter, in 1929, and served as its first president. I was the western regional director at that time, the second person to hold this office, Vivian Osborne Marsh having been the first. In 1928 and 1929, I was the general chairman for the first two Delta scholarship balls in this city. Both were successful, but the second year I did most of the work because many of the committees failed to function. The Delta Sigma Theta National Convention was held in Chicago in 1933, and I attended as chairman of the National Standards Committee, and a delegate from Nu Sigma chapter in Los Angeles. Although I was nominated for the office of national vice-president at the convention, I declined. I remained active locally until the mid-1930s, then became inactive for important personal reasons. Since then I have attended only Founders' Day celebrations and other special events. Since almost no one else has saved any early Delta correspondence and records, I am consulted frequently for this early history.
ER:	I would like you to describe some of your many awards.
MM: There aren't so many, and some of them are not too important.
ER:	Well, but they're all...
MM: I was elected to Sigma Delta Pi, the Spanish honorary society in my senior year﻿79
MM: (cont) at the University of California in Berkeley. A service award was received from the Los Angeles Fellowship League in 1935, and a similar one from the Los Angeles Urban League in 1948. In 1960, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors presented me with a citation for my service with the Los Angeles County Community Coordinating Councils; the Los Angeles Sentinel newspaper presented me with the Award of the Decade in Literature; and the Olympia Council of the California Congress of Parents and Teachers presented me with an honorary life membership, in recognition of my contributions to the community. The Youth Advisory Board of the National Conference of Christians and Jews presented to me in 1969 a certificate of appreciation for supporting the Brotherhood-Anytown Youth Program. The Biddy Mason Award was received from the Federation of Black History and Arts, Inc., in 1974, and the Rhea Award as a "Newsmaker of 1975" from the National Association of Media Women.
My biography is listed in the following: Who's Who on the Pacific Coast, 1949; Who's Who in Colored America, 1950; Who's Who of American Women, 1958/59; the Dictionary of International Biography, 1968; Who's Who Among Black Americans,
1977/78; and is scheduled for publication in 1978 in The Directory of Significant Twentieth Century American Minority Women. My biography was requested for Who's Who in California and the world Who's Who of Women at a time when I was so busy I neglected to fill out the forms before the deadline dates.
ER: During your career as a librarian and as a private researcher, you have been
greatly involved with Negro history. Therefore, I would like your opinion on the following: do you think we're on the right track in terms of zeroing in as a people on our history, our heritage—black people, black history? Do you think more should be done or do you think enough has been done? Do you think we are at the level now where we can kind of coast for awhile, in terms of exhibitions, articles, works that have been produced...
MM: No, I think we need more exhibitions, publications and so forth. The only thing I don't approve of is a separate black studies department conferring degrees. In place of separate black courses, they should rewrite the histories and books in all subject fields to include the contributions of blacks and other minorities, so all students (not just those who elect to take black studies) will learn that all segments of our population have helped make America great, and therefore will treat them with greater respect.
ER: I recall several students, who graduated from college after I did, who earned degrees in black studies and found that they were at a dead end. People said, "Oh, really? A degree in black studies? So what?" You know...
MM: I have come across instances where universities appointed certain individuals
to teach black studies who had no background for the position. After receiving the appointment, they did not have the intelligence and ambition to do some quick research and build a lesson plan. My nephew, Chuck, took a course in black history at the University of California in Berkeley, and the instructor gave the class a one-page bibliography which included Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn. Why on earth he should have included this novel for such a course I cannot guess, also, why he restricted the bibliography to only one page, when there are many good annotated bibliographies he could have consulted in the library. From what I learned from my nephew about the two black studies courses he took, I consider them both a waste of time. This opinion is shared by individuals who know about black studies courses in other leading universities.﻿80
ER: Well, a lot of those courses were initiated under considerable duress during the sixties. A lot of black studies departments were begun suddenly and people were brought in to teach them suddenly to quell the...
MM: Complaints from blacks!
ER: Exactly. Let us change to another subject. Miss Matthews, your resume says you were born in 1905, your birth certificate no doubt confirms that, but my eyes do not believe that you are seventy-two years old...
MM: No, not until August. I'm seventy-one right now.
ER: Well...
MM: Close to it, though.
ER: If you have found the fountain of youth or the secret of the fountain of youth,
would you mind sharing that secret with us?
MM: I have been endowed with good health and a great deal of natural energy. Besides being active in a normal way, I have played tennis or attended gym classes twice a week until a couple of years ago. I believe one is apt to retain one's youth by keeping active, trying to maintain good health through sensible habits, and engaging in productive projects and hobbies. However, I will let you in on a little secret. I think I am just plain lucky to have been blessed with energy and good health.
ER: Indeed you are. Now I would like to know, what is your philosophy of life?
If you had to be tacked down to one philosophy or an all-inclusive philosophy, what would that be?
MM: That's a hard question, coming unexpectedly...
ER: I thought I would surprise you with that one.
MM: I don't know what to say. Perhaps I sum it up with the biblical saying, "While we have time let us do good unto all men." I try, when I can, to help others in every possible way. In addition to helping individuals I know personally, I make contributions every year to a number of worthwhile causes. My family feels sometimes I overdo this a bit, but I guess that's the way I am.
ER: Is there anything that you haven't done with your life that you've always wanted to do? And still look forward to doing? I was just wondering since you've done so much...
MM: I would like to get my research and picture files on the Negro in California properly organized and indexed, since I am leaving them in my will to a local university. Most of all I would like to publish several books on my research topic, particularly my pictorial history of blacks in California. If this happens before I am incapacitated, then I would like to take a leisurely trip around the world.
ER: I want to ask you a question I've been waiting to ask for many days now, and that is, what do you consider, out of all the things you've done, your most﻿81
ER: (cont) important contribution or your most important achievement?
MM: It's difficult for me to restrict my answer to just one item, but I would have to list first of all, my leadership in opposing censorship and promoting the cause of intellectual freedom locally and nationally. Secondly, I would mention the research I have done on the history of the Negro in California, which has proven useful to a number of individuals and institutions. And last, I would cite my fight against race prejudice in the Los Angeles Public Library system (and elsewhere), finally achieving recognition as a librarian, not as a black librarian. Also succeeding as a regional supervisor in the Los Angeles Public Library, when so many of my peers said it wouldn't work because of my race. I feel this helped make it easier for those who followed. There have been at least a half-dozen black librarians appointed as principal librarians, the grade I held, and one, Loyce Pleasants, has been appointed as a division librarian, supervising all the central library departments. There are only two positions higher than hers, the city librarian and the assistant city librarian
ER: Now for the final question. What do you consider the significant influences in your life?
MM: At the top of the list I would place my parents' training, aid and support at all levels, particularly my mother's encouragement, which gave me confidence in myself, since I was rather shy while I was growing up. The church and my religion, which have been discussed already, definitely were stabilizing influences in my life. Going away to college, having to make my own decisions and handle my own finances helped me to build character and become more independent and resourceful. My choice of a profession probably changed my life a great deal, and without a doubt my travels were a definite broadening influence I greatly appreciate having learned early in life to stand on my own two feet, to form my own opinions, to stick by my principles, and to speak up for what I thought was right.﻿MIRIAM MATTHEWS
