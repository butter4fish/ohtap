Because people look up my astrological charts and they say, oh May 2nd, she got a Mars crossing something or Venus and I don't want people to go into my birth date so I just say in May.
Speaker 1: All right, May 1916.
Speaker 2: True.

Story_ID: 79860
Speaker 1: Now I want you--I wanna talk about your--
Speaker 2: Anything.
Speaker 1: --family tree basically and--how far can you trace your family back?
Speaker 2: Well I know my grandmother [Olive Bird Clanton] and I know about her mother.  That's really it I guess.  I knew my grandmother and she talked a lot about her mother.
Speaker 1: Now is this your grandmother on your mother--
Speaker 2: On my mother's side.  I did not know the relatives on my father's side.  He [Robert Ledley Grant] was born in, I think England and then Trinidad, my father was white.  And when he came to Chicago [Illinois], he started--should I do this?
Speaker 1: Yes, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.  He started going around with my mother [Johnetta Clanton Grant], thank you dear, and I was conceived out of wedlock, which is why they moved because at that time that was a terrible sin.  Now movie stars have babies all the time and they don't even think about getting married.  But they moved to--he took her away and took her to Buffalo, New York, they got married there and they had me.  And then about a year later, not quite a year, they brought be back to the family, her family and they said, oh she's so big and I was supposed to be a year younger, but I actually I had been born the year before.  So it was strange.  And I didn't know that I was born in--that the date--when, oh let's see, this was in--I was married and teaching school and the Board of Ed [Board of Education] had to ask about my birth.  They wanted to know my birth.  So I said to mother, Mother I was born in Buffalo, wasn't I?  Why did I come here?  She said, yep just Buffalo.  So I wrote Buffalo, New York.  And they said we have no Rebecca Grant born in May, whatever it was, but we have one born the year before.  And that's when I came back to mother and I said, Mother, they have me with another birth date, and she said, yes.  Then she told me I was conceived out of wedlock and they had to take me out of town.  Then brought me back and that's why I have--why I didn't know my birth date.  I thought I was born in September and I didn't feel like a Libra or whatever the September.  And when I found it was May, I felt like a May person.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Strange beginning.
Story_ID: 79861
Speaker 1: You said you knew your, your mother's [Johnetta Clanton Grant]-- your grandmother [Olive Bird Clanton]--you can go back to your grandmother's mother?
Speaker 2: Mm, mm
Speaker 1: All right.  Do you know her name or where she lived or what--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they, they were in Louisiana, mm, mm.  And then later they--yeah they were in Louisiana.
Speaker 1: What was her name, your great-grandmother?
Speaker 2: My great-grandmother's name?  I wish you would have told me 'cause I could've looked it up.  I have--in my Bible; in a big Bible I have all that.
Speaker 1: If you don't remember, it's all right but--.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I just asked --
Speaker 2: Mm mm.
Speaker 1: --it's good to get the details out in an interview like this, but they were from Louisiana?
Speaker 2: They were from Louisiana.
Speaker 1: Do you know where?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  When I went to New Orleans [Louisiana], I saw the church where my grandmother and my grandfather, Solomon T. Clanton, Solomon Trumone Clanton and my grandmother, Olive Bird Clanton, they had a big church there and his name was engraved in the, in the church and everything and I looked and I said, oh there are my grandparents.  But as I told you they brought us all--they brought the family to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church, do you remember--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --or what denomination it was?
Speaker 2: Oh I think it was Baptist, mm, mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was part of the founding of the church in New Orleans your-- great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --great-grandfather?
Speaker 2: My grandfather.
Speaker 1: Your grandfather.
Speaker 2: Yes, uh, huh.  And he--they had many children like nine I think.  And he had--and at that time New Orleans was white, blacks, they all lived together in New Orleans.  And each one of his children had a different nanny to breast it because he didn't want his wife to be breastfeeding all these children as they were coming up.  He thought it would ruin her figure.  He adored his wife.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What year was it that your--approximately when or exactly when did your family move to Chicago?
Speaker 2: They moved to Chicago whenever the, do you remember when they passed the Jim Crow law and they said all blacks have to move to the end of the bus like [Rosa] Parks, you know, in back of the bus.
Speaker 1: Yes Plessy v. Ferguson [1896] down there.
Speaker 2: Whatever year that was--it was a government ruling that they had to go to the back of the bus.  He said my children will never do this so that was the year he moved them all away and came to Chicago so he could study at the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].  He was a brilliant man.  He learned Hebrew and Aramaic so he could read the Bible that was his ambition in the original.  And my grandmother tells me that one day, they were in a Jewish fish market.  You know how they wrap the paper--the fish in newspapers.  So my grandfather went over and picked up the Jewish newspaper and he was reading it and they were laughing, the people behind the counter and nudging each other, like look at that black man, he doesn't know what he's reading.  So they said, what are you reading there son?  And he starts reading the paper to them.  And they said, he's reading Hebrew, my black brother.  And my grandmother says all of the Jewish came up and hug him and kissed him and called him their black brother because he knew Hebrew and he could read the newspaper.  He was so smart at school at University of Chicago.  They didn't hire blacks at that time, but they asked him to stay and help the white students to study Aramaic and Hebrew because they were failing and he passed and he just went zoomed right through it and he stayed there.  When he died, he was at the University of Chicago.  And he was helping the students there learn Aramaic.  He was on the payroll, but not really as teacher there.  And--I should have brought you the papers, because they sent to me, when he died, Dr. [Edgar J.] Goodspeed at the University of Chicago and most of the doctors there at the theological seminary, all attended his funeral and he was a big name there at the University of Chicago.
Speaker 1: His name was Solomon Clanton?
Speaker 2: Solomon Trumone Clanton.  Solomon T. Clanton. He was very good friends of, uh the one who started Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama], what's his name?
Speaker 1: Booker T. Washington.
Speaker 2: Booker T. Washington, he--Solomon Trumone Clanton and Booker T. were close friends so all my uncles and aunts when to Tuskegee because Booker T. said, oh send your children to me and they all went there.  My mother graduated from there and knew George Washington Carver very well, 'cause her off--her room was right next to where he did his work with the peanuts so all of my family went to Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: Do you have any other stories about your family (unclear)?
Speaker 2: You wouldn't want, you wouldn't want--we couldn't stay here that long (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  You can tell us what you want but--
Speaker 2: No, so much.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 79862
Speaker 1: Well, tell me about your father's side?
Speaker 2: Oh my father's side.  I don't think they knew he had married a black woman.  Uh, because he would write to them, but he never really told them where he was.  But after my father [Robert Ledley Grant] died, two of his sisters' sons who were in the [U.S.] Army at that time, I guess World War [II]--after Pearl Harbor, they came to Chicago [Illinois] and looked me up.  And they said we are Robert Ledley Grants' relatives.  And I said, oh come and have dinner with me.  And they were tall, tall like Scott, tall handsome, two white boys and I had a friend there and we gave them dinner and they said oh, in England we don't have steaks like this.  We--they said at this time during the war we--this would--I gave them each big porter housesteaks and they said this would feed our whole family.  And I gave them some money so they could see Chicago, but that--then they came back and said oh, he was married to a black woman and they said I was nice, but that's the last I ever heard of them.  His sister, my bro--my father's sister was the head of a large hospital in England and they were English.  I should've brought my daddy's picture, I have a picture of him.
Speaker 1: His name was Robert Lea--
Speaker 2: Robert L-E-D-L-E-Y, Robert Ledley Grant.  And my brother who you saw on the porch holding my dog, my brother is Robert Ledley Grant, Jr.  And he has a son, Robert Ledley Grant the III.
Story_ID: 79863
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother.  Can you give us her full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Johnetta, J-O-H-N-E-T-T-A, Johnetta Clanton Grant 'cause she married Robert Ledley Grant.  And my mother taught school here [Chicago, Illinois].  She also played the piano.  She was a marvelous pianist.  She taught me lessons, I can't play the scales.  She taught me for several years and I just couldn't catch the piano.  And so then she said well I can't teach you.  She had me take lessons from the famous--the woman in Chicago, the mother of--the art--he was the--why can't I remember these things.  He had a orchestra.  Think of a big orchestra black fellow.
Speaker 1: A band leader here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yep, a band leader all over the nation.  And his mother lived in Chicago and I took lessons from her.  It'll come to me in a minute, I'll think of the name.  And even at that--
Speaker 1: I wasn't Shake Williams was it.
Speaker 2: No, no, better known than that.
Speaker 1: Ellington, Basie?
Speaker 2: Correct.  Duke Ellington's mother [Daisy Kennedy Ellington].  I took lessons from Duke Ellington's, mother.  And I finally learned to play something.  The piano was not my forte.  I wrote, I write poetry things like that, I'm not a pianist.
Speaker 1: Now I was asking you about your mother--
Speaker 2: Okay.  But she was a pianist and she taught school.  In fact she came--we lived across the street from Douglas School, 32nd and--there by Griffin Funeral Home, we had our property was right there.  So I went to do--Douglas School as a child.  My mother happened to go there subbing one day and she was in my room.  She said stand Rebecca and read.  I couldn't read this book.  Mother came home horrified that I was so stupid.  Took me out of the public school right away and sent me to a Catholic School, St. Elizabeth's.  And I went through St. Elizabeth School up to high school, then I went to Hyde Park [High School Chicago, Illinois].  But--and she taught me to read, with the ruler in one hand.  Every time I missed a word, she hit me on the hand.  Oh it was hard, but I learned to read rapidly after that and after that I never put a book down.
Speaker 1: It was like Catholic school or something.
Speaker 2: Oh that Catholic school was horrible.  They would--the nuns would dig their nails in you and push you in the seat and they were just so cruel.  And they--they gave us little, like this, cups to beg money--could you give some money to the Catholic school.  And so a friend and I would walk--at lunch time we had these--this moneys, these bags and, oh look at the dear little children.  They were dropping money in.  We had two containers filled with money and the bell rang, but we could--we were still asking so we were late getting into this room.  And the nuns, here they are, these bad girls, late again.  And they were coming up to punish us with these sticks and I said, but we were out collecting money for the school.  We gave them these bags (laugher) these containers of money.  Oh you darlings and it was a totally different story then (laughter).  Those nuns were very rough.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.  So now, now did your mother, was she born here in Chicago?
Speaker 2: Yea, no.  She was born in--all of them were born in New Orleans [Louisiana] before they came here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 79864
Speaker 1: Okay. Well tell us about your father [Robert Ledley Grant].  Now you gave us his name.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And he was born in England?
Speaker 2: He was born in England, but somehow he went to, was it Trinidad?  My brother has been to the place where he was born, I think it was somewhere like Trinidad.  And he came from there to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Uh, huh.
Speaker 1: He was English by nation--(unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: He was English.
Speaker 1: Now what was he like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: What did he do?  Well mainly he was a cook as I remember.  He used to be a cook on a railroad station.  You know when the trains, the elaborate trains, had--you could come and eat in one of the departments.  He worked in the train, on the trains.  Then he got to Chicago.  And then he worked at Stop and Shop where he went into the butcher shop there and they thought he was white.  And then some people came up who knew him or knew his wife and talked to him and they called him back and they said, are you black?  These people all seem to know you.  And they fired him.
Speaker 1: They thought he was black or--
Speaker 2: They--because the people where talking to him they were suspicious then.  No he looked white.  But that's why they didn't--
Speaker 1: I'm confused 'cause I thought he was white.
Speaker 2: He is white, he was white.  And that's why they hired him, but the fact that so many of the black people who came in knew him, that they fired him.
Speaker 1: So they really thought he was black because--(unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Yes, true.  They thought he was, but he was white.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.  And so he went to--oh a friend--he went to another shop--really he had cut his hand and that's what made him sick and he died in the shop, but he was a butcher for most of his life.  And one day I think I was in at Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], yeah I was at Hyde Park, I was sitting in the kitchen doing my homework, writing, and I heard (knocking sounds) three knocks on the table.  So I sat up and a voice said to me aloud, go into the front room, Great Spirit will talk with you.  I got up and I dashed out of the house in the back and ran to the front and sat on the curb.  And my daddy was coming home from the off---from his shop.  He said why are you sitting out here on the street like this?  I said daddy a voice said go into front room, Great Spirit will talk with me.  He said why didn't you go in and sit and listen?  And I had peeked into the room and I didn't see anything, but one light on in the corner and I ran out.  I didn't want Great Spirit to talk to me.  But my father, that's why I think I was born into that family, he was very spiritual.  And he was always seeing things and talking to people I didn't know was in the room and so think that's why I came because I had known my father in a past life.  My mother and I were not close.  And thought she was very mean.  She was always beating on me and beating on my brother [Robert Ledley Grant, Jr.], but my father never did.  And I adored him.  Well, should I go to the end of this?
Speaker 1: Well you can.
Speaker 2: Well, after my daughter [Candace Trolley Love] died, my father died and mother was all alone in the house there on Griffin's Funeral Home and they wanted to buy the house from her so that they could have more parking space there in the funeral home there at 32nd and King Drive.  And I so said--I went to her, I said Mother why don't you come and stay with me because I'm all alone now in this big house.  Candy is dead, Edison [Love] is--my husband dead and you could--and she said the only way I'll come if you promise you'll never put me in a nursing home.  I said Mother I'll never put you in a nursing home.  So she sold her home to Griffin and came and stayed with me.
Story_ID: 79865
Speaker 1: Now tell--can you reflect back and give us some idea of some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up in the neighborhood?
Speaker 2: Smells, I don't notice any smells (laughter).  No I, I was really a reader all my life.  My brother would play across the street in the playground at Douglas [Elementary] School and would play basketball, but I was just alone in the house reading, reading, reading.  My mother [Johnette Clanton Grant] taught school and my father [Robert Ledley Grant] was at a shop working and I was--when I would come home from school, from St. Elizabeth Grammar School, I was at Hyde Park [Chicago, Illinois], I was just in the house reading.  And I really didn't go out and play with children, all I did was read, read, read.
Speaker 1: Did you like to read?
Speaker 2: Oh I love to read, yes, reading is my life.
Speaker 1: What were your favorite books?
Speaker 2: Oh you name it (laughter) anything.  I'll never forget--and then every Saturday I would go to the main library on Washington, downtown.  It's now the [Chicago] Cultural Center and I spent all day there and one day I was coming home on the bus with a lot of books and a lady, a white lady, said look at this little girl.  What are all these books you're reading?  And she said, [William] Shakespeare!!  Can you read Shakespeare?  And she was making fun of me (laughter) and the fellow said let the little girl alone.  But I was reading Shakespeare in the eighth grade.  Any book I could get my hands on, [Geoffrey] Chaucer.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did your mother help you with those?  Did she--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --kind of guide you?
Speaker 2: No.  After she taught me to read, I just went on my own.  She liked to read too, but I read more than she did.
Story_ID: 79866
Speaker 1: Now did you like school?
Speaker 2: Yea, I love school.  I loved Hyde Park [High School, Chicago, Illinois].  My favorite--Ms. Biggs in English.  Yes and saw Ms. Biggs after I was out of Hyde Park, out of Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois] and I was in the library and I saw her and she was my teacher in Hyde--in high school and I went up and talked to her.  And she remembered me and she said what are you doing now?  I said I'm teaching school and you were my favorite teacher because she was teaching English and gave us all these wonderful books to read.
Speaker 1: Now you say your, your grand--was it your grandfather who helped you get into Hyde Park or--
Speaker 2: No, that was my uncle [Benjamin Clanton].
Speaker 1: Your uncle.
Speaker 2: Who was a lawyer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he got me into Hyde Park, did something about the, what do you call it?

Speaker 1: In the City of Chicago?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: And his name was again?
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: His name again was--
Speaker 2: Benjamin Clanton, Attorney Ben Clanton.  Very close to, what was this woman who was always cursing (laughter).  You would know her name if I could remember it.  He just knew all the lawyers at that time, they all knew him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Speaker 1: Now, okay, Hyde Park--so you went to Catholic grade school--
Speaker 2: I went--yes, St. Elizabeth Grammar School and then to get into high school I went to Northwest--to uh, Hyde Park.
Speaker 1: Yes, okay.  Now what was Hyde Park like when you were there?  Were there many other blacks there?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Just a handful of us.  But I enjoyed it and I enjoyed the lessons and everything.  Learned a lot there.
Speaker 1: Now that part of town there that Hyde Park is in now ironically is considered Woodlawn [Chicago, Illinois] now.
Speaker 2: Yeah it is.  It's all black.  I see the people pouring out, blacks when I pass by.  It wasn't at that time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Wasn't it--is it an extension of a Hyde Park Community there with the University at that time where people living over there that associated with--
Speaker 2: What people?
Speaker 1: People associated with the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Oh yes, of course, mm, mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm, mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now what were your--well was your favorite subject once again literature at Hyde Park?
Speaker 2: Yes, true, absolutely.  I wasn't too good in math and I had to take math over and then I loved it.  This was a math teacher that everyone still writes about.  And she made the math so interesting.  I had to take it during the summer so I could go on to the next grade.  And I loved it, taking it from her.  If I could think of her name.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh, huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what was some of the activities you were involved in at high school?  Did you get involved in some of the usual high school--
Speaker 2: Well I wrote, because in Hyde Park some of my poems were in the Hyde Park paper, the school paper.  But that was really it.  Mm, mm.  Although I--in high school I was interested in dance and I went to the Artists and Models Ball.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what's the Artists and Models Ball?
Speaker 2: Well, that's, that was when young girls, we had--they had a big thing in the Parkway Ballroom.  And we danced and did different things and it was really a fashionable affair every year.  And Margaret, Margaret Goss, what's her name now?
Speaker 1: Burroughs.
Speaker 2: Margaret Burroughs [HM] was in--helped direct it and everything.  It was very nice.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I did that.
Story_ID: 79867
Speaker 1: So, so what are some of the highlights of your high school days [at Hyde Park High School, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Nothing really stands out.
Speaker 1: High school was (unclear).
Speaker 2: It was nice, but nothing dramatic, not that dramatic.
Speaker 1: Where there any outstanding students at school with you or teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes I talked about my English teacher and I can't think of the math teacher there that everyone would know.  No I can't think of any outstanding ones.  I'm sure there were some.
Speaker 1: Were the blacks students treated fairly well there?
Speaker 2: I think so, mm--mm.  We kinda stuck together, ate lunch together and all that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So well when you were in your senior year, what did you think you would do next?  Did you think you would go to college or--
Speaker 2: Mm-mm, yes of course, but I went to the [Chicago] Teachers College [now Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois].  I didn't go to Northwestern [University, Evanston, Illinois].  I went to Teachers College and finished from there and then went right into teaching school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you went to Chicago Teachers College?
Speaker 2: Chicago Teachers College.
Speaker 1: Okay and that was on Wentworth or something right?
Speaker 2: Oh I don't --yes I suppose.
Speaker 1: It's now Chicago State University I think.
Speaker 2: Is that where it is?  Is that so?  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well how did you like Chicago Teachers' College?  Did you commute back and forth between home and school?
Speaker 2: Yes, of course, mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That too, uneventful.
Speaker 1: All right.  So after Chicago Teachers' College, you started teaching school--
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: --in the city?
Speaker 2: Mm-mm, taught for 38 years.
Speaker 1: It seems like its pretty fast (laughter); we have to go--what school did teach at?
Speaker 2: I taught at the Doolittle [Elementary] School on 35th Street and I was there the old time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now at this time--
Speaker 2: Third grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, you taught third grade.
Speaker 2: Third grade and I went on then to Northwestern and got my Bachelor's and Master's and then my husband [Edison Love] said, oh now that you have your Master's, you don't have to stay in third grade, you can be a principal.  And I said oh sure, I could be a principal or he said, you can go to high school and teach high school.  I said I could do that.  He said then why don't you?  I had no desire.  If I had been a principal, all the teachers are on the principal and talking to them and wanting this and that and the Board of Ed [Board of Education] is on the principal, they want so much of the school.  I just wanna to shut my door and teach the class.  I didn't want all that responsibility.  I didn't want to go to high school because I'm short.  When I taught fifth grade there, all the students were taller than I and I was glad to get back to third where I felt I had some control over them because I'm short and they were shorter than I was, eight years old.  So my husband said, so you just wanna stay in third grade, no ambition, no ambition?  And he just was so disgusted with me 'cause I didn't wanna get out of third grade.  At that time I was just going to yoga.  And I was reading these books on yoga.  I had a correspondence course with Self-Realization Fellowship in California.  And they were sending me lessons every month and I was writing, reading and writing back and sending--and I was two years corresponding with them and meditating and I did not want to do anything further with the Board of Ed.  So my husband felt, no ambition.  He didn't know my ambition was to become one with the creator of the universe.
Speaker 1: Now, now--
Speaker 2: Much greater ambition.
Story_ID: 79868
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, how did you first become interested in yoga?
Speaker 2: I picked up a book called Paramahansa Yogananda's book, "Autobiography of a Yogi".  You know the book Scott?  He's nodding, Autobiography of a Yogi.  I read this and at the back it said you can take lessons by corresponding to the Self-Realization Fellowship, that's Paramahansa Yogananda's organization in California.  So I wrote and begin getting lessons from them and then begin meditating, it changed my whole life because then that's when I begin to see other past lives.  I went deeper into mediation, I did the Hong-Sau breath which is the baby kriya where you go (breathing in sounds) ah, e, inhaling "ah", exhaling "e" up and down the chakras in the spine.  And so, oh, maybe I should tell you this.  Once the--the second year that I was taking these correspondence courses, I took Candy [Candace Crolley Love] and all the children and we all went to our summer home that you saw in Michigan.  And the caretaker there had--we had said we were coming up and he had taken the blinds off and all that and had the cottage open and ready for us.  But here I looked up and there was a big beehive at door.  I said oh, the bees are coming in and out they're gonna sting Candy and sting the children.  So I took a big pole and knocked the beehive down.  But one bee came, zzzz, and stung me in the arm.  I didn't know that a bee sting could kill you.  And that night my arm turned black and blue and begin swelling and my aunts there and my grandmother they said, oh maybe you should go into town, 'cause we lived around the lake, maybe you should go to a doctor and find a doctor in town.  I said oh I'll be alright.  It's gonna go down, I can sleep and if it worse, we can go tomorrow, Saturday.  So I got in bed and my husband [Edison Love] got in his bed at the side and sound asleep and the arm was killing me.  I said there's no way I can sleep with this bite, this bee, my arm was pulsing up and down.  Why I said this, I don't know, I didn't say oh Father help me or God help me, because at that time Paramahansa Yogananda where I was corresponding and kept--was not my guru.  I said Yogananda help me.  When I said that, the ceiling open, light came down and a voice said begin Hong-Sau.  So I begin breathing, Hong-Sau, up and down the spine.  I didn't do three breaths before I was soundly asleep.  And I thought I wouldn't sleep at all that night, I did Hong-Sau.  I woke up in the morning; my husband was out of bed.  I looked out on the lake; he was out fishing in the boat in front.  I went down my aunt was--I smelled the coffee in house.  She said how is your arm?  I said my arm?  I hadn't thought about it.  I said well it's fine, I knew it would be better.  I didn't tell, of course, that some man, some guru had healed me.  That next summer when I went--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, who is this guru that--
Speaker 2: Paramahansa Yogananda who wrote the book Autobiography of a Yogi.  He's dead, he was dead.  He had been dead since '52 [1952], but I called on him.  So when I got a letter that I had to come to California to be initiated in kriya yoga, and I left, first time I left my family at all, I flew there and when I got in my room in LA, [Los Angeles] they said oh come down and let's see--let's listen to Yogananda, there's a tape of his.  I didn't know they had a tape of him.  So I went down to the dining room and he said, I Paramahansa Yogananda I am talking to you.  I said to myself, that's the voice that said to me year ago, begin Hong-Sau.  So I had knew he had healed me.  It was the same voice, the same heavy voice.  So he was not dead.  They call him an ever living guru and he definitely was.  He helped me that night with my arm.  Other times, I'm not even going into to it, but other times he's been back and has helped me with other things in life.  He's an ever living guru, Paramahansa Yogananda.

Speaker 1: What is mediation?
Speaker 2: Oh in mediation he [Paramhansa Yogananda] says you should sit quietly, begin doing the breath first, Pranayama, breating Hong-Sau up and down or go into regular kriya  that I can't tell you about 'cause you're not supposed to discuss it unless some else knows major kriya .  And after doing this breathing for about a half hour, then you just go into silence.  You focus ajna chakra, the point between the eyebrows that--where the light comes.  This is where we're connected with our spiritual self.  The physical body and the soul, the other body connects here and there's a silver card that goes up from the center of the forehead, the pineal gland, the pituitary gland and then you finally end here after an hour or so and focus here and then you move into like another dimension of your being, of your own being and you realize you're not this physical being, you're a spirit, you're a light being.  That's what mediation is.  It moves you away from your physical self to the self that you truly are.
Speaker 1: Now can you tell me the difference between the kind of yoga that you're involved in kriya and other forms?
Speaker 2: Oh there are many forms of yoga.  I didn't know there was Hatha yoga because as I say when I went down and saw the people--oh I didn't tell you that.  Also beside listening to him [Paramahansa Yogananda] they said let's go look at the asanas.  And I said what is that?  Because I thought yoga was only this, sitting like this, doing breathing and going within.  I didn't know you could stand on your head and do the plow and do all these different postures and sit in the lotus.  And I looked in this big room where all these people were exercising.  I said is this part of yoga?  They said this is the first rung on the ladder of yoga because if you don't exercise the body and keep the body strong and healthy and not allow illness to take over, you cannot sit for an hour in mediation, you're in pain.  So you've got to do the physical aspect of yoga before you can move into Raja yoga or the--Raja is just sitting in mediation, but you have to do the lower aspects of yoga so that you can sit still for a long time.  Sometimes when I sit to mediate and I think I've been doing this for an half hour, I better do something--get ready to start my day and I've been sitting there for two hours.  You don't realize how the time goes.  So you have to do--there's many aspects, Karma yoga, the yoga of good deeds, helping others, the physical aspect of yoga, Raja yoga, Kundalini yoga.  There's many yogas, many aspects of yoga.
Speaker 1: What does yoga mean actually?
Speaker 2: Oh yoga, listen, yoga, yoke.  Yoga is like yoking a horse to a carriage.  Or you yoke of cow to pull something.  We are yoking the body and the mind to the spirit, to the true self.  Yoga is yoking.  You're yoking the lower aspects of yourself, the physical body, yoking it to your higher self and that's true mediation.  Yoga, yoking, to become one with the creator so that you can co-create.  You become co-creator with the creator.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Story_ID: 79870
Speaker 1: All right.  Now so how long ago did you started--
Speaker 2: Oh, starting--started taking the lessons.  Let me see.  Well I was still teaching school then.  That's must have been in, oh, 1960.  I remember it exactly.  Fifty-nine [1959] going into '60 [1960] I had to go to California to be inducted into the meditation of kriya Yoga and that's when I found out that he had spoken to me the summer before and there's more aspects of yoga than I thought.  And then when I came back in '60 [1960], I went to Canada and study with Vishnudevananda [Saraswati] in Canada.  And studied then all over with many yoga teachers so that I became first because I realize I had to go into the physical aspects of yoga.  I still mediated, but then I added the other aspects to my yoga.  That's why I couldn't-- didn't want to become a principal or teacher in high school.  I just wanted to finish up, get my pension from the Board [of Education] and go more deeply into yoga.
Speaker 1: So you started like 43 years ago?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Forty-three years ago.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: All right.  What'd been some of the highlights of practicing yoga for 43 years?
Speaker 2: Oh perfect healt--I'm 90 years old.  I have not been to a doctor in 50 years.  I did go to the doctor when my daughter was born, but when Candy [Candace Crolley Love] was born, I haven't been to a doctor.  I wouldn't take an aspirin.  I'm in vital health.  I don't wear glasses.  I can read a phone book without glasses.  I have all my teeth (laughter) nothing--now people someone said to me, now you're 80-something, where is arthritis, where are you stiff or where are you--I said stiff?  Where do you have pain?  I don't have pain anywhere in my body, no pain.  Yoga keeps--it reverses the aging process.  Yoga reverses the aging process, absolutely.
Story_ID: 79871
Speaker 1: So these are some of the benefits of yoga?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely.  Besides being happy and I don't--I wouldn't' quarrel with anyone or I don't get angry because I'm cent--I'm balanced and centered.  And someone said to me--if someone came up and slapped your face you get angry.  And I said if someone came up to me that I didn't know and just slapped me, I would think, boy did they get up on the wrong side of the bed this morning and bless them.  I wouldn't get angry or want to retaliate.  I would just bless them and let it go.  Speaking of that, a Mr. Price who lives on my block has a big Rottweiler.  I was in the alley taking garbage out and this Rottweiler, he lets him run up and down King Drive and in the alley.  He ran up behind me, grabbed my heel and really went into the leather and pulled the heel off and I had a terrible gash on my heel from this dog.  And I was just gonna put medication on it and Swedish bitters and work on it myself, but when my niece, Robert Grant's daughter who now lives upstairs on my third floor, she said oh that heel looks terrible, you should go to the doctor.  And I said maybe so and I went to Michael Reese [Hospital] the emergency and they said, oh, this is a very bad bite.  And they put my foot in a big pail of antibiotic water and then they said now you have to give us the name of the man who owns the dog because we have to report it.  I didn't want to report him, but they called the police into the hospital and they took Mr. Price's name and all that.  And now you have to take, the doctor said, you have to take a course of antibiotics because this dog bite might have poisoned you.  I said now you put my foot in antibiotic and I knew I was going to take lots of vitamin C and other things as soon as I got home, I said don't write me a prescription for antibiotics 'cause I'm not going to take antibiotics.  I don't want to put any medication in my body.  I wouldn't take a vaccine or flu shot or anything.  And then he called another doctor and the two of them stood there telling me how I must have these--this antibiotics.  I said doctors, haven't you heard that people are over using antibiotics and if they take too much of it, when they really need it, you'll be immune to it.  And one doctor looked at the other and said they do say that.  So they didn't insist that I take the antibiotic, but he did say come the next day and put my foot in this antibiotic water again.  I said I'll do that when I come back from my yoga class I'll come by and do that, which I did, but I wouldn't take the medication.  About two months after--and my heel, you can't even see where the dog bit me although it was bleeding everywhere, two months after that I walking my baby dogs that you saw, the pet poodle and pet terrier, this same Rottweiler came dashing down the street and jumped on Nibby, Nibiru his name I call him Nibby, he's named for a planet in the solar system called Nibiru.  My other dog is name Yogi Shanti named after Yogi so I call him Yo-Yo.  He jumped on Nibiru and gouged him in the stomach and bit him and he-- well I had to take him to the vets hospital and they had to shave him and put 10 stitches here and stitches by tail and so now my niece is suing him for both biting me and the dog.  But I, I still speak to him and I'm friendly with him, 'cause everything happens as it should.  There no accidents in the universe so I don't think, no accidents and so there was some reason that I was bitten like that.
Speaker 1: Is that a teaching of yoga that there's no accidents?
Speaker 2: Yeah I feel that it is.  It's not--that's not just yoga.  Even the Buddhist say that, everything happens as it should, no accidents.
Story_ID: 79872
Speaker 1: Nothing's an accident.  If something happens to you it's because you have brought it to you with your consciousness or it's a lesson you have to learn in this lifetime.  I often wondered there, I forget the children what in Africa what they were all starving, where?
Speaker 2: Several places.
Speaker 1: Several places,
Speaker 2: Nairobi (unclear).
Speaker 1: No it wasn't--Could be, yes.  These children were children--
Speaker 2: Somali Land.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, could be.
Speaker 2: Could be.
Speaker 1: Yes.  These children were, it was on TV, these children were all starving and I said why is this whole place is no food growing, the children are starving.  And then someone said to me, these children were Roman soldiers in the past and they--the Roman soldiers, when they went and conquer a land, they salted the land so that nothing could grow.  Salted it so all the people would all starve and couldn't have children because nothing could grow over this salted land.  I--they said these children in Africa were in one life time the Roman soldiers who went out and salted the land.  And now they have to learn, they're not being punished, but they have to learn what's it's like to grow up without eating and growing up hungry and their little bellies all puffed out with starvation.  And that's why I say, things that seem like what's a terrible accident or is this God's plan?  No, it's a learning experience.  So we're either here to learn in somewhere or another so that we won't repeat these foolish things we do in the future, no accidents.
Speaker 2: How would little children, those children know that they were Roman soldiers??
Speaker 1: They won't have to know that, but their consciousness, collective consciousness of this whole African tribe, when they go back to the after death and they go back to their guides and their helpers and the people who can talk with them to say what you'll learn in your next life, 'cause we all decide where we gonna go and with what group we're gonna be again and you decide who your parents are gonna be.  And they know then, oh they won't know its children, but they'll know when they--after they've passed on and they're getting these lessons between lifetimes and they're gonna be shown their life as a Roman soldiers and how what they did to the land then, and why they're not eating now.  You see what's it's like to grow up without eating and to try to survive and starve when you're six or seven.  We learn because the creator loves us all and wants us to come back with greater wisdom.
Story_ID: 79873
Speaker 1: Now is yoga, as you see it, is yoga--
Speaker 2: Way of life.
Speaker 1: Okay so it's religion and practice of--
Speaker 2: I really don't call yoga religion.  You can be a yogi and many people--Catholics have come to my class, Jews.  And then some people from India who hadn't taken yoga have been and said we just want know what yoga is and give us yoga in America.  You don't have to--it's not a religion as such.  Yoga is a way of life.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: So it's--but how would--I would think that a Catholic wouldn't under--wouldn't have the same view of reincarnation as a--
Speaker 2: Why not?
Speaker 1: Well it's not part of Catholic teaching.  You know, that's, that's all I know.
Speaker 2: Did you read the Bible?  Have you read the Bible?
Speaker 1: Not all the way through.
Speaker 2: Okay, because Jesus said, who do people think that I am?  And his one disciple said some people say you're Elijah, meaning Elijah who's come back again.  And some one said you're Elisa [sic, Elisha], they believe totally in reincarnation.  However that was taken off in 1540 at the gospel of Ni--at the meeting at Nicaea, when they changed and took many things out of the Bible and in the Bible it tells directly that they all believed in reincarnation.  And in the book that's not in the Bible, but the books that are out of the Bible, you know, that they didn't put in the Bible.  What did they call them?
Speaker 1: The apocrypha.
Speaker 2: The apocrypha, yes.  The Book of Mary Magdalene, Mary Magdalene sits and talks to the disciples and tells them how Jesus says we live again and again and again.  So the Catholics may not believe it now, but they did at one time until it was taken out of the Bible, but--almost all religions know that we lived many times, mm-mm.
Story_ID: 79874
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell me now you begin to--when did you begin to teach?
Speaker 2: Teach yoga?
Speaker 1: Mm-mm.
Speaker 2: Well I took lessons after I went--1960 to California and then I took lessons in Canada for almost a year and Temple [of] Kriya in Chicago [Illinois] and all over and then Par--Par--the teachers, Swami, at the Temple Kriya said you're ready to teach.  And I said oh no, I'm not ready to teach.  He said yes you are.  And he insisted that I teach at the Temple of kriya first and then after that I went to the Lawson [House] YMCA on Chicago Avenue.  They called me and said I understand you teach yoga and would you teach here because we need a yoga teacher.  Then after that so it was about three years I studied and did it on my own.  Did yoga--every day I came in from school and put a mat down and did two hours of yoga at home and then I would go to a yoga class once a week somewhere in the city, but I prac--did a lot of practicing before I started teaching.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: So does it take about two hours to really do it right?
Speaker 2: Well I loved yoga, so it took me two hours, I spend two hours a day at it, yes.
Story_ID: 80719
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me ask you--
Speaker 2: Anything.
Speaker 1: you some more questions--
Speaker 2: Anything.
Speaker 1: Now--so you started to teach, about four years ago?
Speaker 2: Yoga, mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Yoga, yeah.
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: And now how did, did it improve your classroom teaching do you think?
Speaker 2: Well I added yoga to my classroom teaching, because often when the children were restless or when we done a lot of heavy writing, writing, reading, arithmetic, we would stop and we would stretch and I would have them put their hands to the floor, but you know those kids couldn't put--couldn't kiss their knees, so stiff.  And I thought it was because they eat these hamburgers and French fries.  They come in the morning with bags of French fries and they bring candy in the room so I said, in the basket.  I said, now if buy fruit you can keep--eat the fruit all day long, apples, oranges, bananas, you can put it on your desk and eat while you're writing, because I knew they needed more fruit in systems and their parents probably didn't give it to them.  So I would let my yoga, toward the end, the last few years, I would let my students bring fruit into the room and they loved that and they ate fruit as they were working or reading.  Even the principal would come by and say, oh this room smells delicious.  I said they're eating fruit.  And even the principal would do some yoga postures with us because his back was hurting.  So yeah, I brought yoga into my third grade classroom later.
Speaker 1: The school you taught at, Doolittle [Elementary School]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --is one of the toughest inner city school.  Now I noticed and if there's a, I mean, it's right in the Kenwood, Oakland community where--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's a tough area.  A lot of projects around.
Speaker 2: Oh the projects, true.
Speaker 1: Before they start rehabbing these Greystones cut up these little apartments--
Speaker 2: True.  But at the time I was--it's worse now, much worse now.  The time I was teaching it was not that bad, mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  When did you retire from teaching?
Speaker 2: I retired in '80--was it '86 [1986] or '87 [1987] like that, mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean Doolittle was still pretty rough in the '80s [1980s] (laughter)
Speaker 2: Yeah, it got worse, it got worse.  I'm glad I'm out of it now because people who are there say they can't even discipline the children or talk to them.  Their parents wanna come and, and fight them.  What did you say to my child?  And so when --
Speaker 1: If some of the parents can be found.
Speaker 2: Yeah, true.  But when I was teaching, if I sent a note home that so-and-so was disobedient or did this or that, the parents would wanna come and beat the child (laughter) in front of the classroom.  They were very, you know, very cooperative, but no longer, no longer.
Speaker 1: It's hard to believe that was an improvement, but actually probably was.
Speaker 2: It was 'cause the children listened to both teacher and parents then, now they listen to no one.  So I'm glad I'm out of the Board of Ed [Board of Education] thing.
Story_ID: 80720
Speaker 1: Now there are--you said at one point there's an aspect of yoga that is altruistic or karma.
Speaker 2: Karma yoga.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Karma is the yoga of doing kindly deeds and everyone you meet you silently bless.  Karma yoga is the yoga of good deeds.  There's many, many different aspects of yoga.
Speaker 1: Now The Civil Rights Movement, you were teaching doing the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Did you take note of or notice the non-violent teaching of Gandhi--
Speaker 2: And [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Dr.].
Speaker 1: Right, right, yeah.  But, you know, Gandhi was a (unclear)(simultaneous) of yoga.
Speaker 2: Yeah, absolutely and he was Martin Luther King's guru, mentor, really, mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Do you know much about that relationship or did you think about it much or talk about it much in those days?
Speaker 2: Oh yes I read many things by Gandhi, about him, about him, yeah.
Speaker 1: I've often wondered non-violent direct action training included some aspects of yoga technique?
Speaker 2: I think so, mm-mm.  And you know Gandhi really--he was total vegetarian.  And his daughter, was--Gandhi's daughter was very sick.  And they said she should eat eggs because she has--doesn't have enough protein in her body and if she doesn't get more protein she's gonna die.  Gandhi said, oh no we can't eat eggs because I don't want her to kill the chicken, you know, the chicken that might be born in the eggs.  They said you can give her eggs that have not been, uh, what?
Speaker 1: Fertilized.
Speaker 2: Un-fertile eggs that haven't been fertilized by the male so that she could eat the egg, but she's not killing a life.  He said, oh well if she can do that and he let his daughter eat unfertilized eggs so that--and she did regain her health.  She was about to die so he was a strict vegetarian, mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was ready to let her--his daughter die than eat anything that would kill life.
Story_ID: 80721
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me what are some--I guess what are some of the highlights of your career as a yoga instructor?  I know you taken groups--
Speaker 2: We've had many groups.
Speaker 1: --to other countries.
Speaker 2: Many groups, groups to Acapulco [Mexico] to Hawaii to all over.  Mex--and Rio Caliente that I really like and Mexico.  And those are highlights, but highlights are also people who just come and say to me, Becky, you've changed my life.  And many people that I've taught for many years have gone on to take teacher's training and become yoga teachers, like Hap, Sara Hypie (ph).
Speaker 1: Asar Hapi
Speaker 2: Asar Hapi who was one of my yoga--many of the teachers who are teaching in Chicago, I have taught at the beginning, many of them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Now what is the--what are some the attractions and some of the places that you take students to like say Mexico why would--
Speaker 2: Oh why?
Speaker 1: --why Mexico?
Speaker 2: Because the food is all vegetarian and all natural and the water isn't polluted or un-chlorinated and no, what is this thing that they say are good for your teeth that they put in the water.
Speaker 1: Fluoride?
Speaker 2: Fluoride, no fluoridation all that.  It's just open and joyous.  And we get up in the morning, we hike in the mountains and we have a yoga class and we have organic breakfast and it's just a lovely environment.
Speaker 1: Okay, it's just a change of scenery.
Speaker 2: Change of scenery and pace and we have lectures in the--every lectures--lectures in the evening.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So there's not a special attraction other than it's a change of scenery.
Speaker 2: Yes, true.  What do you mean by special attraction, like--
Speaker 1: I don't know, there may be some aspect of Mexico and some place in Mexico that enhance mediation or something--I mean I don't know I'm just--
Speaker 2: Yeah, well one of the places where we mediate they say that under it is a burial of Indians, ancient Indians and we feel that.  You can kinda feel the vibrations and that does help the meditation and that's in this place where we go in Rio Caliente.  So there are many, many places like that all over the world though, mm-mm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what's been the greatest benefit of being a yoga instructor, being involved with yoga?
Speaker 2: Well as I told you, I feel that I'm helping other people and they come to me and say I have.  And I just say thank you father and just go on, but that's just one of greatest benefits.
Story_ID: 80722
Speaker 1: Tell me what are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community?
Speaker 2: The black community?  I'm sorry I can't think of the black community as apart from any of the other community, we're all one.  I've--my hope and concern is that we all are going to live in peace after this third World War that we're entering.
Speaker 1: So you think we're on the verge of a third World War?
Speaker 2: Don't you know we are?
Speaker 1: I know it but--
Speaker 2: We're really in third World War now, but Michael Gordon Scallion [sic, Gordon-Michael Scallion], he's a remote viewer, he's one of the people that government used to hire to sit and look into the future so the government, he worked for the CIA and now in remote viewing he says, as soon as Turkey, you know, Turkey has all these troops now in north Iraq at the border ready to move in to the Kurds and Iraqi as soon as Turkey moves in and World War III--it's a start of World War III, and this is gonna go on for five or six years.  It's gonna involve--to the big battle of Armageddon.  It's going to the battle of Armageddon if you read Revelations.  So this is--we're in the latter days, we're in the latter days.
Story_ID: 80723
Speaker 1: Okay, now Ma'am what would you consider as, I know you're still teaching, and still--
Speaker 2: True.
Speaker 1: --feeling good and everything, but what would you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: I don't have a legacy.  I'm sorry (laughter) I don't have a legacy.
Story_ID: 80724
Speaker 1: Okay, well with that being said, this is slightly different, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I don't want--I don't care if I'm remembered or not (laughter).  I said to my niece who's moved in over me, I said when I die you can just take my body and put it in the alley behind the house 'cause there's so many hungry dogs that I try to feed outside and let them just eat off me and they can feed off my body.  She said--
Speaker 1: I believe the Health Department would be upset about that.
Speaker 2: (Laughter), that's what she said.  That's illegal, I can't do it.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: But you can do it as far as I'm concerned.
Speaker 1: What you're really trying to say is this, this life or the remains, your--
Speaker 2: It's nothing
Speaker 1: --it's not important.
Speaker 2: Not important to me at all.
Speaker 1: But you know beyond the physical remains, you know, what would you--
Speaker 2: Oh I'm gonna live on.  I can't die, I've died--I've seen death so many times, I can't die (laughter).  I'm eternal, I'm an eternal being just like you are and we're gonna live on and on and on.
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you wanna tell us?
Speaker 2: No thank you.  It's been nice meeting you and knowing you.
Speaker 1: All right, well nice meeting you.
Speaker 2: Thank you my dear.
Speaker 1: Thank you very much.
