 Finchum Today is March 18, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma  State University. I am speaking with Dr. Bob Miller, Robert Miller, Regents  Professor Emeritus, and this is part of our Phi Beta Kappa project. Thank  you for talking with me today. I will say that I am in Stillwater, Oklahoma,  on the campus of Oklahoma State University, and Dr. Miller is in Santa Fe,  New Mexico. Is it okay if I record this?  Miller Of course.  Finchum Okay, thank you. Let   s begin with learning a little bit about you, starting  with when and where you were born.  Miller When and where, oh my. (Laughs) I was born in Modesto, California, in  1945.  Finchum What did your parents do for a living?  Miller My family was ranchers. My father kind of skipped out on them and worked  for the county. He was superintendent of road maintenance and construction  for Stanislaus County. My mother was a practicing artist.  Finchum That explains a lot. You have an interest in art, too, from what I remember.  Miller Yes, yes I do.  Finchum I think you were an only child, too. Correct?  Miller Yes, I was an only child, and I was actually adopted. I was adopted when  my parents were in their forties. There is a long line. For instance, I can say  that my grandmother   s uncle was killed in the Civil War. So there   s   I  don   t have as many generations between the early part of the 19th century  and me as most people do.  5  Finchum Still came from good stock. When you were in high school   let   s go back,  where did you go to elementary school and then into high school?  Miller Okay, I went to elementary school in Modesto at John Muir Elementary  School, which is really quite a good grade school in Modesto. Schools were  very good at that time and still are. My father   s best friend was  superintendent of the school so I kind of had to do well or my parents would  find out. I went to junior high school at Roosevelt Junior High. My uncle  was the principal, so again, I had to do pretty well or my folks would find  out. Then I went to Thomas Downey High School in Modesto and graduated  there in  1963 , I guess.  Finchum No one to tell on you there?  Miller Kind of not, I mean the principal was a good friend of my uncle who was a  good friend of my father   s, so there   s always someone to tell on me, I   m  sure. (Laughter) The other thing was while I was in high school, (that was     63 I graduated, not    67 by the way,    67 is university), my dad and I found  the remains of a 1930 Model A scattered over a couple of miles of a  farmer   s ranch. Bought it for a hundred dollars and we restored it. I drove  that to high school, so driving around in a 1930 Model A with brass wheels  my dad knew just about everywhere I was, at all times. (Laughter)  Finchum So did everyone else.  Miller Absolutely. (Laughs)  Finchum That was pretty cool to be able to do that.  Miller Yes, it was. It was a lot of fun. When I went to college it would only   top  speed was thirty-five miles an hour and the minimum speed on the freeways  in California was forty-five. So I sold it to Harrah, as in Harrah   s Club in  Reno, Nevada. He had a museum, an antique automobile museum, and I  sold it for like eight thousand dollars, so I made a profit too.  Finchum Do you know if they still have it.  Miller No, I don   t really know. I   d love to go back and see. My dad also had a 1916  Jeffery, which he sold to them and I   d love to see if it is there. That was a  beautiful car. It was an extended body with jump seats, and it was really  something else. Jeffery became the Nash and now is gone forever, but  anyway.  Finchum Having a car like that kept you popular with other kids in school?  6  Miller Yeah, it did actually I think. I was in what you call AP  Advanced  Placement  classes now. The whole concept of an advanced class was just  beginning. It was something that was ran just by the   you know, the  Modesto Schools ran it. There were a group of us that started out in eighth  grade with advanced math. We started algebra in eighth grade, which is  maybe not that uncommon now, but then it was unheard of. Then when we  went to high school we added English, history, and science, so that the  cohort of thirty stayed together pretty much all the time through those years  while other kids were moving. We could select classes, like in college, and  move between classrooms. There wasn   t quite the bond, I think, between  many of the other kids in high school like our cohort of thirty who I still  keep in contact with through Facebook.  Finchum When you weren   t studying what were you doing for fun?  Miller Oh, what was I doing for fun? Well, I was in the marching band. I was  second chair clarinet in the concert band and one of the fun things was that  put me in the pep band, or the jazz band if you will. We had a lot of fun  going to away basketball games and that kind of thing. Other than that I  loved to go hiking, and that kind of thing was probably what you would  consider fun. I actually considered studying fun. (Laughs) I   m nerd number  one.  Finchum What was your favorite subject?  Miller What was my favorite subject? In high school I guess biology was my  favorite subject. I had a wonderful teacher, Mr. Peterson. I   m sorry, Mr.  Johnson. I don   t know why I said that, but anyway, he was just great.  Because we were in the advanced program, we took each science   most of  the kids in ninth grade took general science, we took first year biology so  that we ended up taking two years of biology, and there was an advanced  program they used that was experimental at that time from the University of  Colorado. So we actually got to do some microbiology, but we went on field  trips and went to Bodega Bay, where The Birds was filmed, because the  Stanford Research Facility was there. We looked in tidal pools and did a  bunch of things that were a lot of fun. Listened to opera all the way home, I  remember. It was a Saturday so we listened to the Met  Metropolitan Opera   broadcast on the way home. I still remember that.  Finchum Is that at the point you decided, hey this may be the area that I want to  specialize in?  Miller Actually, Mr. Johnson got me going, but what got me really decided was  when I was a junior in high school, between junior and senior years, Gallo  Winery, which is in Modesto, gave me an internship. They put me in their  microbiology laboratory. I was working with a biochemist and a  7  microbiologist to try to develop at that time, although I think they   ve given  it up as they   ve decided to become a better winery, to develop stainless steel  aging tanks instead of using oaken barrels. Anyway, that introduced me  really to microbiology and biochem and some concepts of engineering.  That   s really what decided me was that internship at Gallo Winery.  Finchum Was it always assumed that you would go to college?  Miller Yeah, it was always assumed I   d get a Ph.D. My father only went to eighth  grade. My mom went to high school and only had one year of college, but  because when they were a young married couple, in 1928 they got married,  they fell in   just because my dad built their house and it was a new  complex. They fell in with these three other couples and just were lifelong  friends. As I said, one of them was the superintendent of schools, the other  was my uncle, the principal of my junior high school, and the fourth was the  principal of the other junior high school in Modesto. I don   t remember a  time when it wasn   t assumed that I would get a Ph.D., the only question was  what would it be in? They didn   t really care. (Laughs)  Finchum Then once you graduated, take us through your college career.  Miller Okay, well I want to say one thing, too, in regards to Phi Beta Kappa there.  When I was either in eighth or ninth grade, in English we wrote a story  about two people that met on a train because one had dropped their Phi Beta  Kappa key and the other one returned it to her. So that led me to find out  about Phi Beta Kappa, and it was a goal of mine to be in Phi Beta Kappa  ever since reading that story.  Finchum Wow, okay. That   s cool.  Miller Yeah, and so when I started to go to college, there were some financial  restraints but I decided to go to the University of California-Davis. A lot of  my friends were going there. Out of our class of 430-something kids at  Thomas Downey High School, 400 of them went to college. You couldn   t  hardly not run into someone you knew. I went to University of California-  Davis. They have a great microbiology department. It   s still rated in the top  ten in the United States. While I was there I studied micro and biochemistry.  My minor was in studio arts, as I said. I got to study with Wayne Thiebaud  who was pretty famous artist in the Andy Warhol tradition. If you   ve ever  seen paintings of gumball machines, that   s Wayne Thiebaud   s. So I had a  great time.  I got to work in a microbiology lab. I worked in Dr. Robert Hungate   s  laboratory. Just as a bottle washer, you know, although he let me do some  experiments. Dr. Hungate was president of the American Society of  Microbiology at one time and is a very famous microbiologist because it  8  was under him that methods for growing anaerobic microorganisms were  developed. Organisms that can   t live in the presence of oxygen, he  developed methods for cultivating them. The Hungate tube is still the  primary way to cultivate anaerobic microorganisms. Because he was an  anaerobic microbiologist he enjoyed that. His research was mainly in the  rumens of cattle and sheep, which is some of the most anaerobic  environments there are. Because of that, most of his graduate students,  etcetera, were from places like New Zealand, and South Africa, and  Scotland. Places where they grow a lot of sheep and cattle.  So I was the only American in the lab as it turned out, which is fine.  Actually, there was one graduate student working on isolating  microorganisms from elephant dung, so we kind of got together. They used  to love to kid me by asking for particular things by the common name in a  British laboratory and not an American. So instead of a rubber stopper I was  asked for a rubber bung. Instead of a bulb for an eyedropper, I was asked for  a rubber teet, and those kinds of things. They just loved watching me run  around the lab, pick up things,    Is this a rubber bung?       No.    It was fun and  I learned a lot. They were all really good to me. I think that really cemented  the fact that I would be a microbiologist.  The other thing that was funny, of course Davis was one of the few  universities in the world that you could actually get a Ph.D. in enology,  that   s winemaking, so we got to take a number of wine appreciation courses.  That turned out to be fun. That led, off and on, led to some interesting  experiences through my lifetime. As far as non-science, non-studies   oh,  and the other thing I did at Davis which was unusual was I decided to get a  bachelor of arts degree instead of a bachelor of science degree. The  reasoning was that there were more humanities and social sciences required  for a bachelor of arts. I had time because I   d gone to junior college half-time  as a senior, so I entered the university with a semester of credits. I had time  to take all the requirements for the BS, and still take a BA so that if my  advisor said,    Why are you taking ancient history?    I could say,    Because  it   s required for my degree.    I   m still glad I did that, and I ended up taking a  year of ancient history and a year of medieval history, which I probably  wouldn   t have been able to otherwise.  The dogs just walked in the door, so we may have a little woof-woofing at  times. Extra-curricularly, my major activity in college, outside of some  music, was involvement with Alpha Phi Omega, which is a service  fraternity. Now it accepts women as well. You have to have been a member  of the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts to get in, but I went and I served as  president of the chapter and actually chairman of the region, which was  Washington, Oregon, California, and Nevada. We did lots of fun things. I  was on the rally committee, which was in charge of all of the rallies. We got  to actually select the cheerleaders and that sort of thing.  9  At Davis the big thing is not homecoming, although homecoming is really  big and I was in charge of homecoming when I was a senior, but Picnic Day  is even a bigger event. That happens in the spring just about now.  Originally, all the students invited their parents up for the day to have a  picnic. Now it   s everything from cattle roping and rodeo to parades. I got to  be in charge of the Picnic Day Parade too and that was a lot of fun. Those  were some of the most interesting things we did. Course with the rally  committee we got to go to Berkeley a lot to meet with the rally committee at  the UC-Berkeley and that was just at the beginning of the free speech  movement, so we got to be involved in some of those things as well.  Finchum And you were there from    63 to     Miller Sixty-four to    67.  Finchum Sixty-seven. While you were there were you in Phi Beta Kappa?  Finchum I was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, yes, as a senior. It was interesting because  the Phi Beta Kappa chapter at UC-Davis is the Kappa of California chapter.  It was established in 1968. So what they did was the following: Davis had  been part of the University system since the 1890s. During that time was  when one of the great grape blights was going on worldwide. The legislature  of California told the University of California that they were to study that  and find a cure.  They found they couldn   t grow grapes very well in Berkeley, so the  University bought the Bixby Farm in Davis. They did what was called the  University Farm. It was part of the University of California-Berkeley  campus, and if you were in agriculture, which was a major part of Berkeley  at that time, you spent your junior year on the farm. That was Davis. In    56  Davis became an independent campus but because of that, Phi was Berkeley  until they got their own chapter. We were inducted into the chapter at  Berkeley. So we got to go out to Berkeley to be installed into Phi Beta  Kappa, which was a lot of fun.  Again, when we started college there was   you could take a test, during the  first week, in chemistry. If you were good enough in chemistry they put you  into a special chemistry class, which covered the first three semesters of  chemistry in two semesters, but to be in that class you also had to be in  physics and calculus. So again, about I guess it was twenty-four of us got  into that class and we kind of became a cohort again, because again almost  all of our classes we were having together because we had to. It was fun  because from that I met my best friend through college, and roommate. His  name is David Coplin, now Dr. David Coplin. He   s a microbiologist at Ohio  State University   and some other people. We all got into Phi Beta Kappa  10  together, so we all got to share that experience, which is always fun, going  to places, a big time you know.  Finchum I understand there   s a secret handshake. Do you remember yours?  Miller Yes, I do  When we got our new chapter that was one of my duties in the  installation was to teach the new members the secret handshake. However,  the secret handshake really isn   t secret anymore. I mean you can go on the  web and see it, but when Phi Beta Kappa started it was kind of necessary, I  think. As you may know, Phi Beta Kappa started at College of William and  Mary, actually in a pub in Raleigh, Virginia   maybe it   s Richmond, I  forgot. That   s terrible, isn   t it? I   m getting old I guess. Anyway, it began on  December 5th in 1776, and it was a debating society originally. It   s also the  first Greek letter society. So some of the things they debated were not  considered appropriate perhaps. For instance, one of the first big debates  was, did Adam and Eve have navels? So they really had to keep it secret  because they could   ve gotten in trouble either with the university  administration or with other people. Of course in 1776 there was a lot going  on, obviously. It needed to be secret then, but it really isn   t secret anymore.  You still get taught it when you   re installed, yes.  Finchum Once you finish there, where did you go next?  Miller When I graduated from Davis I wanted to continue my studies in  microbiology. I applied to and was accepted to the University of Illinois at  Urbana. Spent my graduate career there. Illinois was one of the top micro  departments in the United States. Also, my mother was from Illinois, and I  wanted to see what living in Illinois was like. Let me tell you, for a liberal  California boy it was a shock. (Laughs) I mean it was so conservative that I  almost couldn   t handle it for a while. I have learned that there are more  conservative places in Illinois since then, but at that time it was a real shock.  So anyway, I went to the University of Illinois at Urbana in the  microbiology department. I went there to study with a man named Ralph  Wolfe who was a good friend of Dr.   of the people at UC-Davis, and Dr.  Hungate. He was also an anaerobic microbiologist who studied San  Francisco Bay mud. So I thought that I would have the advantage of going  to school where my mother was   grew up, and yet still be able to come  back in the summers to San Francisco to dig up bay mud to study. He was  on sabbatical when I went and so I got, I   ll say seduced, into another  laboratory, into molecular biology laboratory that of Dr. Paul Sypherd. We  were studying the ribosomes, which are the organelle in the cell that makes  proteins, and so I ended up doing my research degree with Dr. Sypherd.  Halfway through Dr. Sypherd was appointed chair of the new department of  microbiology. It was called Environmental Interactions II, at the University  11  of California-Irvine new medical school. They had to have   this was the  early 19   well, it was 1970 and they had to have these fancy names.  Anyway, it was microbiology. So as his students we went with him,  remaining students   officially students of Illinois but physically doing our  research at UC-Irvine. So that was quite an experience in itself.  Finchum From cold weather back to warmer.  Miller Yeah, too warm. We discovered during that period that there   s no seasons in  Southern California. I like seasons, but anyway. When it   s the same  temperature on Christmas as the Fourth of July after a while you begin to  forget where you are and when you are. The circadian rhythms and the  biological clock gets screwed up. Who knows, anyway, I didn   t like it very  well.  Finchum When did you graduate from Illinois, University of Illinois?  Miller I got my masters in    69 and my Ph.D. in    72. Then I finally made it kind of  almost full circle and did a post-doctoral fellowship with Dr. Alvin J. Clark  at the University of California-Berkeley.  Finchum Back in California.  Miller Back at Berkeley at least, that   s close to Davis. Spent two years at Berkeley,  which changed my research direction into becoming interested in how  bacteria exchanged genetic information and how they survive in the  environment under the effects of ultraviolet light. At that time with Dr.  Clark I primarily did enzymology, learning about the enzymes that are  required for recombination, genetic recombination, in bacteria in living  species. It set me towards a goal of trying to understand how bacteria  evolved to acquire new genetic information and utilizing it.  And we played a lot music, it was fun. In the laboratory among the graduate  students and post-docs there was a string quartet. Two violins, a viola, and  cello. I play the clarinet. So on occasion, they played every Sunday night, or  every other Sunday night for their own enjoyment, they would let me come  and play things like Mozart   s    Clarinet Quintet    with them every once in a  while, and that was a lot of fun.  I also got really, really, really excited about recorders at that time. I ended  up being president of the East Bay Recorders Society and we did a lot of     we made some extra money when the violinist, and the cellist, and I playing  the recorder would go play trio sonatas for weddings and that sort of stuff. It  was a lot of fun then. I must admit, it was a lot of fun then. It was just at the  end of the Vietnam War, so Berkeley was pretty spaced out, if you want to  call it that, and enjoying itself. I enjoyed it along with it.  12  Finchum You   ve had a lot of experiences, too. From winemaking to all of this. It  seems interesting how it   s all come together.  Miller Yeah. So from there I went to the University of Tennessee at Knoxville.  That was my first faculty appointment in microbiology. I was lucky enough,  while there, to get a NIH  National Institutes of Health  career development  award so that I could spend time doing research. It basically bought me out  of teaching, if you will, but the department let me use my salary money to  run advanced seminars. So we were able to have a seminar class for students  where we had an invited speaker each week, and I was able to get ten Nobel  Laureates and others to come in and do the speeches. It was really a great  learning experience particularly for me, and I think the kids got something  out of it too. That was a good eight years or so.  Until 1980, I was at  UT-Knoxville  at which time I moved to Loyola  University of Chicago   s Stritch School of Medicine, and I became a  biochemist officially and then I moved into the biochemistry department.  While I was there I was chair of the Graduate Council, which oversees  graduate studies. At that time Loyola was trying to get a Phi Beta Kappa  chapter, and I was put on the application committee. While I was there we  applied once and were denied. That was primarily because of questions of  academic freedom. They were concerned about, Phi Beta Kappa, was  concerned about a sentence in the faculty handbook that said we had to  abide by all church rules and teachings, etcetera.  Although I left before they finally got a chapter, they did finally get a  chapter and that did lead to a restatement in the faculty handbook of the  interaction between the church and the faculty and has led, I think, to Loyola  being one of the foremost forward moving religiously associated universities  in the United States and to make a great deal of progress. As you may know  Loyola is   it   s St. Francis of Loyola and is a Jesuit school. The Jesuits are  kind of known for their forward thinking anyway.  It was a good experience for me and at that time, although I   ve been  studying and getting grants, one of the fun things that happened was while I  was at Tennessee, the year after I was hired a new faculty member was hired  whose name is Dr. Gary Sayler. While I was a real molecular biologist at  this time doing enzymology, etcetera, recombination. He was a microbial  ecologist. It turned out he developed a chamber that would allow us to put  bacteria into it and then put it in a body of water like a lake. It kept the  bacteria from getting out of the chamber, but it allowed flow through of the  lake water, etcetera. So it was about the closest thing to studying something  in the lake in the environment as you could do without actually releasing it  into the environment.  13  We liked to go fishing and we wanted to test this. We decided that we could  fish and do an experiment to see whether or not bacteria could exchange  genetic information in the environment. Up until that time microbiologists  assumed that this was only a phenomenon that took place in the laboratory,  because they really didn   t think bacteria could find each other and interact in  the natural environment. So even though two Nobel prizes had been  awarded for it, they still thought it was basically a laboratory phenomenon.  Anyway, we put the bacteria in the chamber and as we fished we threw it  over the side of the boat and did an experiment so we could tell our  department head we were doing science. It was successful   We could prove through the methods we were using, which were primarily  genetic, that in fact gene transfer did go on between these bacteria. So we  published a paper, a little paper. Didn   t think much more about it and then I  went to Loyola and Gary stayed at Tennessee, where he   s now the  equivalent of a Regents Professor and more. We moved forward and  genetically modified or genetically engineered organisms are coming into  being made. One of the first experiments with a genetically engineered  microorganism was at Berkeley where they modified a bacterium to contain  an enzyme that lowered the freezing point of water. This was an agriculture  experiment. The idea was you   d spray these bacteria on trees and it would  protect them from freezing, from rapid freezing, at least down a few  degrees.  Before they could do this, with every genetically modified organism, you  had to get EPA  US Environmental Protection Agency  approval. So there  was a man who was very much of an environmental activist at that time, I  haven   t heard much from him in the last twenty years, but his name is  Jeremy Rifkin. He was afraid that these bacteria could get out and lower the  freezing point of water worldwide. You know, with our environmental crisis  that   s going on right now, a drop of a couple of degrees can really change  how much water is in ice and how much is in water and therefore how high  the seas are, etcetera. He was afraid that it would get out and melt all the ice  in the world, which is probably an exaggeration, but in any case the EPA,  which of course had to defend this, discovered that no one had ever studied  whether or not genetically modified or any other   I shouldn   t say  genetically modified. Whether or not if a bacterium did get into an  environment could it exchange these genes and pass it on to naturally  occurring bacteria except for one little experiment that they found by Miller  and Sayler.  So the EPA called me and suggested that I really wanted to put in a grant  application and if I got it there by February 5 they were pretty sure it had a  good chance. The way I can remember the date so well is that   s the day my  youngest son was born. We were at Loyola and Barbara   s, my ex-wife,  OB/GYN person was the head of the OB/GYN department. So as Cory was  14  being born, he was proofreading my grant as I was making the last few  changes on it before sending it to them. As you can guess that was both a  pleasant and unpleasant experience. (Laughs) Anyway, sent in the grant, got  it, and in fact was renewals and renewals. I had that research project going  for about twenty-five years. It   s turned out to be very successful, so thank  you Cory.  Finchum All from fishing.  Miller But that was it. As far as Loyola was concerned and Phi Beta Kappa, I was  on an unsuccessful application committee that maybe gave me some  knowledge and experience for our experience at OSU. In 1991 I came to  Oklahoma State University as the founding chair of the microbiology  department. I had decided being at a medical school and doing  environmental work was very, very frustrating because it wasn   t quite  understood. And with colleagues it was frustrating because there was very  little or no environmental work going on at this time.  I wanted to find a place where I could have colleagues that were interested  in the environment, both natural and agricultural. I had been director of  molecular biology at the medical school, which was basically a department  head with no budget. It was an interdisciplinary program so I had to get my  faculty from the various departments, paid departments for money, to teach  courses, etcetera, and I figured if I was going to do that I might as well be a  department head and have my own budget so that we could actually do some  things that I and my colleagues together would want to do. So I came to  OSU in 1991, so that   s the beginning of this story. So do you want to ask a  question in between?  Finchum How did OSU win out as the place to land? Were there other contenders?  Miller I   d been offered the position at Arizona State, but the dean told me that 20  percent of the faculty, the tenured-line faculty were paid off of soft money,  that is indirect costs from grants. I didn   t want to get into that situation  because I could just see if the university   s grants went down I   d have to fire  somebody and I didn   t want to do that. I   d also been offered the position at  the University of Maryland in College Park, but the dean there decided to  wait a year to make his final decision.  That was interesting because one of the members of the department there, in  fact the person who nominated me for the position, is a person named Dr.  Rita Colwell who went on to become the head of the National Science  Foundation. But I went there. She   s a very, very strong woman as you might  have guessed having ended up, I think, the only director of NSF that has  been female, that I know of. Certainly the only director that wasn   t an  engineer and was actually a microbiologist.  15  Anyway, when I went there the primary question that everyone asked me  was,    How are you going to handle Rita?    I said,    Well, you know I don   t  think Rita needs a lot of handling, (laughs) but I think I can do it. I   ve  known her for a long time.    In fact, she had been Gary Sayler   s graduate  advisor, so I had known her for a long time. In truth, I don   t know how I  would   ve handled her if I would   ve taken the job, but it was fun to be asked  that over and over again.  Finchum What do you recall about your interview process here at OSU? Like coming  to campus and your impressions, that sort of thing.  Miller Well, there were a couple of things, not all of them positive. I was thrilled  by the potential to develop a department. It had been the Department of  Botany and Micro, and they had some outside consultants come in, one of  whom was Dr. Sam Kaplan of the University of Texas Medical Center in  Houston who had been on my dissertation committee. He told them if that  they really wanted to move ahead in the sciences and biotechnology one of  the things that they needed to do was  split  botany and micro and really  develop microbiology. At that time it was a department of four. When I  retired last year it was almost twenty faculty members. They   ve made a lot  of progress in developing that department.  In addition the renovation of space and the amount of money given to me to  do renovations was very attractive. The fact that the dean of the Graduate  College and vice president for research was Norm Durham at that time who  is in fact a microbiologist. So these are some of the attractive things. I do  remember going to the provost, who will remain unnamed, (you can look it  up) at that time and discussing various things in my meeting with the  provost. I   m not exactly sure how it came up, although I probably brought it  up in some way. The position of music and what were the plans to develop  the music and art department. I can remember him saying,    Well, as long as  we have a marching band for football game who cares about music.    That  was one of the negative parts of the interview, but I decided to stick it out  anyway.  I also remember the then president of the University telling me about his  plans to enlarge the fountain in front of the Library to this massive kind of a  waterworks, something like the Philbrook looks. That was Dr. Campbell. I  said,    Well that   s nice, but       and we do want a beautiful campus, but at the  same time I wasn   t sure that adding all that waterworks was the best thing to  do with the resources available.  Finchum And that hasn   t come to pass, so     16  Miller Hasn   t come to pass. I bet if you dig deep down in the archives there in the  Library you   d find the drawings, because he showed them to me. Anyway,  those are some of the things. I also remember really thinking   the other  thing I remember; I grew up in Modesto, California, as I told you. If you  remember reading The Grapes of Wrath one of the places they   re bound is  Modesto, California. I may say that when I grew up there were a lot of  transplanted people from Oklahoma in my home town. One of the things I  remember when I came to Stillwater was that it seemed like home. The  reason was that the Stillwater accent and the Modesto accent are not very  different. In fact, there are some linguists that actually study the evolution of  the Oklahoma accent as it appears now in Modesto. So I was really feeling  right at home when I came to Stillwater.  Finchum Having said that, growing up did you hear the term    Okie   ?  Miller Oh yeah, I heard the term    Okie.    I must admit when I was growing up it  wasn   t all that positive.  Finchum Yeah, that   s what I was thinking.  Miller Yeah, it was pretty negative in fact. We don   t really need to point it out, but  it was pretty negative, yes.  Finchum Once you got to OSU, did you get involved with Phi Beta Kappa pretty  quickly?  Miller Yes, I go involved almost immediately, because the second   I think it was  the second application round was just starting so they were trying to identify  all the Phi Beta Kappa faculty and I went to the meeting and those kinds of  things as they developed the application, but I was really just a faculty  member. In Phi Beta Kappa the chapter belongs to the faculty members that  were inducted into Phi Beta Kappa as students. So the Phi Beta Kappa  faculty is very important in developing the chapter because the national  body has to be sure that they will do the things necessary to keep the chapter  going, etcetera.  So at that time, when I first came, I was really only involved as a member of  the Phi Beta Kappa faculty and having a great desire, particularly as I left  Loyola up in the air, in being involved in this. Yeah, right from the  beginning. Then there were two more application cycles before we actually  got the chapter, and for the next one I was a member the committee and  Perry Gethner was chair. Then in the last one I was actually designated as  co-chair or assistant chair or whatever, so I was a chair. So for those two  application rounds I was really very, very involved in it. Discovered it was a  lot of work, but in some ways it was a lot of fun.  17  The application materials are extensive. To apply for Phi Beta Kappa it   s a  three-year process. Those two applications took six years, probably seven or  eight actually, if you look at the times in-between. Everything from what is  the age of every building on campus is required and what were the primary  materials for construction. That   s one that always got me. Of course, what is  the University policy on diversity and not only diversity, by ethnic groups,  by sexual orientation, by all of the other things. There   s what portion of the  student body is underrepresented groups, including first generation students.  As a first generation student myself, I was very anxious to see about those  activities. Where did they go to graduate school, how did they do in  graduate school. It   s really a major application process taking lots and lots  of time and lots of lots of paper. I remember that. The first year application  was about two inches thick.  Then after we did that, we sat around and waited, and twiddled our thumbs,  and the senate met, the Phi Beta Kappa senate, and they chose I don   t know  how many of the applications to be considered. So doing the second year we  had to turn in an updated application, which asks even more questions and I  think was only about an inch and a quarter thick, but still. I had that. Then  we got as far as being one of the finalists who had a review team come and  spend several days on campus looking it over and asking us questions, and  etcetera. As one of the committee members I got to escort them around and  be there both to answer questions when it was enjoyable answering them  and answer questions when it wasn   t very enjoyable to do so.  In any case, we appeared to have passed that interview process and so we all  went, including Burns Hargis, and the provost at that time, and Perry   Gethner  and I, and a couple of other people. We all went to what Phi Beta  calls the triennium. It   s their national convention. It only occurs every three  years. It was in Palm Beach, Florida, which was nice. We got to fly down  there and during that convention our application was submitted to the  general convention, which includes one voting member from each chapter  and each club.  Clubs in Phi Beta Kappa are groups of people who are members of Phi Beta  Kappa because they were elected, but they   re not associated with academic  institutions. For instance, Oklahoma City has a club and it   s mainly  populated by lawyers, and doctors, and engineers, and other people in  Oklahoma City that have an interest in Phi Beta Kappa, but are not directly  associated with an academic institution. So each club and each chapter gets  a vote. You have to have two-thirds majority. Anyway, we got two-thirds  majority and became Gamma in Oklahoma, third chapter in Oklahoma  following Norman  University of Oklahoma  and University of Tulsa.  Finchum Do you remember learning that you had been approved? The moment you  were approved?  18  Miller Yeah, the chairman of the committee of members that came to OSU, the site  committee, came to us. We were all kind of all huddled together in the bar,  because we couldn   t obviously go to the meeting while the vote was taken.  He said that we had been accepted. As you might guess there was a good  time had by all afterwards. It was very nice. It was interesting because Palm  Beach facility was at a nice hotel right on the ocean. So it was a nice  environment to go to anyway. The last triennium, which I did get to go to,  was just last September or October in Denver, so they move around. It was  nice, it was very nice. It was very great, it was wonderful.  Finchum If it hadn   t been approved that time, do you think they would   ve kept trying?  Miller Oh yeah, that was one thing that we were told. The secretary of the society,  who is the paid CEO in Washington D.C., said,    The most important thing is  to just keep trying,    because it   s kind of like an NIH grant. I don   t know if  you know about NIH grants, but with NIH grants they always say you don   t  get them the first time, you just have to keep trying. The second or third  time, if you   re going to get one, that   s when you   ll get it. That   s basically  what we were told about Phi Beta Kappa chapters too. Luckily, the  second   well, the second time in the modern era, because there had been   I  think it was actually the fourth application, but there have been breaks in the  others, we made it. So, yes.  Finchum There is an application fee each time, isn   t there?  Miller We have to show support from the administration, although the chapter  belongs to the Phi Beta Kappa faculty. We have wonderful support from  Burns Hargis. In fact, the only application process that went on under Burns  was the one that was successful, and the University paid that fee as I  remember. We also were lucky enough for the last time that Patricia  Houston Prowl, an alumna of the University and she was   she has been  associated with the University in many ways throughout her career, donated  money to establish a Phi Beta Kappa chair, faculty chair, in English. We  know that helped our application a great deal.  Finchum What was the biggest hurdle, do you think?  Miller I think the biggest hurdle was identifying all those buildings and their  construction materials. The first time we applied we had actually gotten to  the interview process, the site visit. Then there was some football scandal,  and that did us in the first time. I remember that one of the objections, as  you may know, Phi Beta Kappa is a liberal arts society so that you have to  be either a major in certain liberal arts and sciences areas or have taken a  significant extra amount of liberal arts, so that it   s not all members of the  student body that are eligible for Phi Beta Kappa.  19  So they   re mostly interested in what   s happening in the College of Arts and  Sciences. Biochemistry is considered an appropriate major, so in our case  agriculture comes in then. Economics, so business comes in, but I remember  the third time one of the biggest problems we had was that we have so many  speech and communication majors, which is not considered a liberal art, but  made up enough percentage of the College of Arts and Sciences    student  body that they were uncertain of the direction of our College of Arts and  Sciences. We had to explain why we had so many journalism majors,  basically, in the college was one of the hurdles I remember.  The other is being sure that   the Phi Beta Kappa requires an intermediate  knowledge of a foreign language, so that translates into three or four  semesters or the equivalence. So we had to show how our program, even  though we only require two semesters of foreign language, fulfilled that.  Our classes in foreign language are worth more credit hours than the average  class in foreign languages, so that our two semesters of foreign language, as  far as credit hours are concerned, is equal to three semesters at many other  universities.  The other was showing, there also has to be a knowledge of mathematics  that   s absolutely required of everyone. So we had to discuss with them the  math requirements in the College of Arts and Sciences. We also had a  couple of Phi Beta faculty   Phi Beta Kappa faculty that weren   t sure that  OSU was the place that Phi Beta Kappa should be. I still don   t understand  their reasoning, but at least at one point one of those faculty wrote a  negative letter to the selection committee, and I think that had something to  do with why we didn   t get it the time before.  Finchum Did that same person change their mind when the successful one came?  Miller I don   t know if they changed their mind, but they remained moot.  Finchum Okay. They didn   t oppose it as strongly the second     Miller I meant to say mute not moot. But anyway, it   s all sorts of different things  because they really want    Phi Beta Kappa, having started at William and  Mary and expanding mainly on the Eastern seaboard, which was the United  States at that time we have to remember, 1776 plus, first went into places  like Harvard, and Yale, and Swarthmore, and those kinds of liberal arts  colleges that it   s clear that you   re getting a liberal arts education. When you  get to a large   and this probably is the major hurdle we went through. When  you get to a large multi-faceted land grant university it   s not as easy to see  how the student body is getting a liberal education and how that liberal  education is important to the administration, and faculty as a whole, of the  university.  20  That probably was our biggest stumbling block was to prove that we  really   that liberal education was important to the University, not just to the  College and that students had the opportunity for a great liberal education.  The idea pushing an international experience helped a lot I know and those  kinds of things. Along with the backing of President Hargis, which it wasn   t  as clear from earlier applications, the stance of the administration, but it was  with President Hargis.  Finchum I   d say you learned a lot about campus and the whole administration part of  campus, too, during this whole process.  Miller Oh yes, you sure did.  Finchum Was the Library a factor in any of     Miller Yes, in fact the Library   s very important in the application process. Both the  physical building, number of volumes, etcetera, how those are distributed,  particularly interest of like special collections and specific collections like  for the humanities, social sciences. I know that the Library was required to  present something like a five-year plan. There was this complete section of  the application that was devoted to the Library. Some of the associate  librarians certainly helped us to fulfill and get those applications together. It  included a necessary mission statement and as I said, a five-year plan and a  number of other things. Yes, the Library was very important, is very  important and is important to any university.  Finchum I remember them working on a five-year plan, but really didn   t know why.  Miller (Laughs) That was part of it anyway. Course I suppose everyone has a five-year  plan.  Finchum Well, when you got the word that it had been approved, you hustle back and  begin to set up the chapter? Or what at that point?  Miller Yes, well we had   of course the chapter has to be installed. So we hustled  back and spent the fall semester, as we learned in I believe it was mid-  August that year the triennium met that we would have it. We had to start  thinking about the installation ceremony, which required getting all that, that  visiting team as far as the president and a number of other people at Phi Beta  Kappa to come and all of the Phi Beta Kappa faculty on campus to come to  the installation. We had it in the meeting hall, I   m not exactly sure what they  call it, on the second floor of Old Central because we felt that that was a  great place that spoke to the history of the University and many of its  traditions. So that we had to develop that, which was a significant  graduation-like situation, banquet and reception.  21  We were also allowed to elect six foundation members. Those are people  that really helped develop the chapter and would continue to develop the  chapter that were not members of Phi Beta Kappa   had not been elected to  Phi Beta Kappa either because of their major, or whatever, or the university  they went to didn   t have a chapter, etcetera. So we had to pick those and go  through that application process. It was actually a lot of work, but the  president   s office helped a lot. Gary Clark and his people were wonderful,  and it turned out to be a very nice ceremony and a very nice weekend. It  took place in February, so the chapter began then.  Of course we had to do things like elect officers and write the actual bylaws  and constitution of the chapter, get it approved by the national and all of  these things as well. There was a bit of work involved, but it was fun work,  because we knew that it was all positive and would be rewarded with a  chapter at the end.  Finchum Time to celebrate. We should probably back up and say it was approved in  2012? Or am I getting my dates wrong? Then the installation was in     Miller It was approved in 2012 and yeah, installed in February of 2013.  Finchum Someone else had mentioned that there was a ceremonial type of event  where they tore up, or burned, a contract of some sort.  Miller Yes, that was during the reception. There had been a contract between one  of our previous provosts and a group of others saying that they would in fact  have a Phi Beta Kappa chapter and they would do all they would to get it.  So at that point, when we had one, that contract or oath was fulfilled and  they did in fact burn the papers. (Laughs) We had a lot of trouble finding  those papers actually. We had to go to the former provost and get them. That  was actually a high point.  Another high point was when the chapter was installed the president of Phi  Beta Kappa   s father had been a faculty member at OSU. So although he   s at  the University of Indiana in the law school, he came back he could not only  talk about the importance of the chapter etcetera in general, but could be  very specific because he   d actually grown up in Stillwater. That was a neat  addition to the whole situation.  Another one was one of the installation team, who is on the faculty at  William and Mary, came and he presented us with an appropriate tankard  that would be appropriate for toasting in 1776. I think that may be in the  Library now. I   m not sure exactly where they have it.  Finchum I   ll have to check. Charles  Abramson  may know.  22  Miller Charles knows.  Finchum Boy, the logistics of getting all those people in one room at one time  would   ve been a challenge.  Miller It was, it was. As you can guess, many of their schedules are such that we  had to find out what was going on. We were very lucky, I think, and had a  lot of support. For instance Mrs. Prowl, who became one of the founding  members as I said earlier, endowed a chair for Phi Beta Kappa. Had a nice  reception in her home for the visiting team, the installation team. We were  able to have a fine dinner at President Hargis    residence on Washington  Street. We had a really great reception. It was a fun time and I think  everyone really enjoyed it. As I see some of the members of the installation  team now and then, they all comment that we did a very good job.  Finchum What do you see as the value, for having done all of this work and finally  getting it for the campus?  Miller Well, there are several advantages and most of all, and the reason we did it,  is for the students of OSU. There   s no question that being a member of Phi  Beta Kappa increases the value of your resume significantly. As far as the  University is concerned, I think that a major university, again, it tells people  that the university has been significantly vetted and in fact does provide an  outstanding liberal education to its students with opportunities to become  involved in and experience the arts, the social sciences, the sciences,  etcetera. I think that as a student moves on they will discover, particularly,  how valuable that can be in many other activities and as I said, increasing  the value of their resume. I think that   s pretty much it. I can   t think of  anything much more valuable than those two things. That   s what I think.  Finchum Going forward, is there a review process or once you   re approved, you   re  in? How does it work?  Miller Once you   re approved, you   re in. However, the chapter has to file an annual  report to show various activities like how many new students did it invite?  Of those how many chose to become members? Did it have a business  meeting? What kinds of activities did it do outside of the installation of new  members? OSU   s chapter has always had a speaker, a Phi Beta Kappa  speaker at least once a year, either an external or internal person, to come  and talk on a particular area, visit classes in their area. I remember one was a  musicologist and an expert in Handel, and she came and gave a fabulous  talk, and then visited many of the both music history and studio music  classes. Spent time on campus. We have to show those kinds of activities.  There is a Founder   s Day dinner held on December 5th of every year or  23  around there about. The chapter has to show that it has done things each  year with an annual report to Washington, but once you   re in, you   re in.  Finchum What is your role in it or do you still have one here for OSU?  Miller As you know, I retired. I was vice president of the chapter until I retired and  in fact for about six months after I retired, because of the logistics of when  officers change. Right now I don   t have any role except as an alumni  member of the chapter. The chapter is run by active faculty members. Once  you are emeritus you remain a member of the chapter, but kind of an  inactive member. For instance, you can no longer vote on those that are     those students that are installed, but you can in fact be part of the review  process of the committee that chooses those to be sent before the general Phi  Beta Kappa faculty. Because I   ve moved to Santa Fe it   s a little hard to be  too active at this point.  Finchum I have covered all of my questions. Is there anything else you want to add  that I didn   t think to ask?  Miller Tanya, I think you were pretty thorough.  Finchum Your involvement goes back to a book basically, when you first read about     Miller Yes. It goes back all the way to junior high. I believe it was eighth grade,  maybe it was ninth grade. At least in Modesto eighth grade   s in junior high  and ninth grade   s in high school, unlike Stillwater. I can   t remember if it  was back to junior high or high school, but yes, it goes back   actually, it  goes back further than that, truthfully, because my parents and their friends  had talked about the importance of Phi Beta Kappa even when I was a little  kid. Like I said, there was never a time when I wasn   t supposed to get a  Ph.D. They just didn   t know what subject I would choose.  Finchum And it was meant for you to be at OSU when they finally were awarded  theirs.  Miller I guess so. We will say so. The committee, although it was a lot of work, it  was a really fun time. Primary reason was the members of the committee  both from the administration and from the faculty were so involved and so  up for the whole process that it just   it made it fun to do. It was a goal that  we achieved, which was even better. It was a goal to look forward to, and  think about, and enjoy reminiscing about for a long, long time.  Dr.  Perry  Gethner comes out to Santa Fe every year for the opera, so he  spends a week here. One week of the season you can go to all five operas in  Santa Fe for the season. He spends that week here. It was the week right  after the triennium in Palm Beach, so he didn   t fly back to Stillwater, he  24  flew to Santa Fe. That   s not quite true, but anyway, he went directly to Santa  Fe and after he came back from the opera we started doing these things. So  it   s always fun to catch up on what   s going on with the chapter and at OSU  when he comes by. So I look forward to seeing him next August.  Finchum I wonder what everyone did with their time after all this had been     Miller I know, I know. Well     Finchum    cleared off their plates.  Miller    yeah, I hope they did some active things with them, but I   m sure they felt  relieved. It was kind of a letdown, you know. In a way it was a little bit of a,  I   ll say, postpartum letdown. That   s not quite true, obviously, but it was  almost like having a baby. (Laughs)  Finchum It sure was.  Miller But we had to find something to do with those afternoons that we had set  aside to meet and applicate.  Finchum I guess part of that was reviewing the potential inductees?  Miller Oh yeah.  Finchum Filled some of that time.  Miller I   ve actually not been on that committee, but part of the hard part was  setting up the criteria so that we would   and the process because obviously  you have to be   not only do you have to be in about the top 5 percent of the  graduating class, but you have to meet these requirements for foreign  language, mathematics, and I think two-thirds of your classes have to be in  the liberal arts and sciences. So the process of even identifying who to look  at was quite a thing. If it hadn   t been for Dr. Campbell and the registrar   s  office, we   d probably still be trying to figure out the first class instead of  the   I guess this is the third class this year, so that will be neat. The process  is just identifying the candidates and then vetting them is quite an activity. I  wasn   t ever actually on that committee and in some ways I   m just as glad I  wasn   t.  Finchum I think the campus as a whole was thankful that you were on the committee  to get it.  Miller I hope so, yeah. I think that OSU is better for it, I think that Phi Beta Kappa  is better for it, and I know that the students will have additional  opportunities because of it, so thank you very much.  25  Finchum Yes, thank you. Alright, if there   s nothing else we will close off. Thank you  for talking with me.  Miller That sounds good, thank you.  -------  -------
