Robert Ferguson: My name is Rob Ferguson. I am here with Eloise Vaughn on  March 31st. We are at her house in Blowing Rock. Ms. Vaughn, thank you very much  for sitting here with me.  Eloise Vaughn: It&#8217;s a pleasure to have you.  RF: First, I want to begin the interview with, just give me a little background  information about where you grew up and where you&#8217;ve lived.  EV: Well, I&#8217;ve had a very fortunate background. I think I had the happiest  childhood any body could have. I was born in what is now Chapel Hill. At that point it  was just north of Chapel Hill in Orange County, North Carolina. And I was born in 1932  on a farm. It was a small dairy farm. And I grew up there with my mother and father and  my two brothers. I was fortunate enough to be able to go to school in Chapel Hill, which  made a big difference for the rest of my life. I went to school in Chapel Hill from the  first grade through college. And that&#8217;s partly because it was fortunate that I lived there  and that was probably the only way I could have gone to college as far as that goes. I  was one of the first people in my family to go to college. It was a wonderful life. It was  a large farm, we could play and roam all around. My younger brother, who is just two  years younger than me, we played and roamed in the creeks, and fields, and woods and I  just had an ideal childhood. It was a close knit community. Everybody who lived around  us for miles we knew, interacted with, and visited with. So it was a very safe place.  There aren&#8217;t many places like that left, I don&#8217;t think, in the country anymore. So that part  was very, very good. So after high school I did decide I wanted to go to college. I  couldn&#8217;t imagine not going. And so I just stepped on over on the campus and went to  school. I was able to finish in just two and a half years because at that point the  university was on the quarter system. So you could go Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer  and that way wrapped up your credits very quickly if that&#8217;s what you wanted to do. And  if you didn&#8217;t have a lot of money, that&#8217;s what you needed to do. So that&#8217;s what I did. I  met my husband while I was on the campus. He was in law school. He was one of the  great wave of veterans who was in school at that time. He was a veteran of Korea and  came back to finish his undergraduate education and went on to law school. So we were  married in December of 1952 and moved to a place called Draper, North Carolina, which  is now part of the city called &#8220;Eden.&#8221; It was put together&#8230; it was&#8230;  RF: Consolidated.  2  EV: &#8230;consolidated in the 1960s. Actually my husband had a lot to do with that  because he was in the legislature and this a matter that has to be finally approved by the  legislature. And so they put together Leaksville, Spray, and Draper and it was called  &#8220;Eden.&#8221; And that&#8217;s where we lived for 18 years. And he practiced law there. He spent  ten of those years in the legislature. He was Speaker in the &#8217;68-&#8217;69 sessions and then he  went on the Court of Appeals and we moved to Raleigh where we lived until I came up  here just for the summers about ten years ago and then loved it so much I couldn&#8217;t leave.  So, I&#8217;ve lived here constantly for the last couple and love it here on the edge of the gorge  just outside Blowing Rock.  RF: It is beautiful.  EV: Wonderful.  RF: Okay, so uh, your husband was a judge and you had some political  involvement.  EV: Yes, we were very political back in our early days in Rockingham County in  the Democratic Party. I was president of the Democratic Women, I was very proud of  that. I was always interested in politics. And his interest was very direct, very great. We  enjoyed going to the Democratic Convention in 1968 in Chicago. I have some  memorabilia from there. We knew, it was fun to know all the people in the country at  that time, because you did get to know people who were doing lots of interesting things  in the country, especially in the state of North Carolina. We knew, real well, people like  Terry Sanford, Governor Hodges and it was a great day for North Carolina and a lot of  progress was made. A lot of good things were done. My husband was a part of that and I  was very proud of that. And in my own way, felt somewhat, part of it, on the outside to  be sure, but it still felt like I was a part of it. I loved it.  RF: And of course your political involvement carried on with MAJIC.  EV: Yes, I don&#8217;t think it would have occurred to Patsy or me, either one, to get  political in the way we did if I hadn&#8217;t a little more about how things work. Patsy was, she  was not apolitical, but Patsy had never took an active part in politics really. And, of  course, we have a wonderful story about how she changed her party after our aquantance  started.  RF: And you played a big role in that?  EV: I think I did (laughter). I thought I&#8217;d lost a friendship there the first day, but  it wasn&#8217;t true. So, yes because knowing and seeing how politics worked, especially in  those days, things were, I don&#8217;t think it was as complicated back then as they are now.  And certainly money was not as a big a part. Money has made the biggest difference in  the way politics is carried on now. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a necessary evil or not, but it was  certainly not a part of how things worked back then. And I really do believe that  3  generally, I don&#8217;t remember great scandals breaking out back then. I don&#8217;t remember one  at all. And I think I would have known it.  RF: Okay, let&#8217;s back up a little bit. Tell me about how you became involved with  MAJIC or how MAGIC came about.  EV: I was aware, well, my son was gay and he died with AIDS in May of 1990.  And at that time, we had a senator from North Carolina, Jesse Helms, who probably was  the most outspoken political leader that we&#8217;d ever seen in the state. You could not be  aware of Jesse Helms and what he was doing, and how he accumulated his power, and  how he worked to keep his power. And I was very aware that one of the ways he did that  was by singling out portions of the citizenry who, for whatever reason, was gay, they  were different. And the way he was making his appeal, it was better for him to be able to  have somebody to single out, to gather everybody with him, around him, behind him to  also say, &#8220;Yes, we have a common&#8230;&#8221; not enemy, but what is my word there? A  common concern here. It was blacks to begin with. It was blacks, quite frankly. I would  go to Raleigh with my husband in the early days of 1960 and we would see him on the  television in his nightly commentaries on WRAL TV. And Earl would say, &#8220;Come here,  I want you see this. You&#8217;re not going to believe what he&#8217;s saying.&#8221; Because we didn&#8217;t  get him on our little TV back in Rockingham County, and we were just sitting there  opened mouth listening to what he was saying on that TV. I&#8217;d never heard people talk  like that, quite frankly, in public, especially not leaders. I had really never heard, and  Earl hadn&#8217;t either. We were just amazed. So I had become very aware of Jesse Helms  and his leading the opposition against civil rights back in the early &#8216;60s. So it seemed  that as we put the laws on the books to put on end to the Jim Crow era, he could not  single out black people any more to direct prejudice and fear toward. And so the next  target seemed to be gays. And that was, gays were the next people he could treat in that  manner, and he was doing it. And I saw that and I knew that&#8217;s what he was doing. And  after my son died, it really began to wear on me just like fingernails on the blackboard or  like saw across the wood. It was extremely painful and extremely hurtful and extremely,  it caused me some great anger, great anger at him and for his cynical views just devised  for his own personal gain, and his own personal popularity, and his own money-making  machine to stay in business and keep his power. I was angry. I saw what he was doing.  I sat there and I watched it, and I listened, and I read, and after I met Patsy Clarke, who  son also named Mark had died of AIDS, we discussed this. And Patsy had another take  because her husband had been an active and open supporter of Jesse Helms in the western  part of North Carolina for many years and had raised a bunch of money for him. And  Patsy had not ever been immersed in politics the way I had and so she didn&#8217;t really give it  much thought. But she was aware, after her son died and after my son died, that here was  a man who was using the gay population for his own aggrandizement. And we talked  about it and we decided, because this was, by that time he was running for reelection to  the United States Senate, the &#8217;96 election was coming up, that somebody should stand up  for the state population and for all the people who were not included in his&#8230; in his&#8230; I  can&#8217;t think of the word.  RF: Platform?  4  EV: His platform, yea, the things that he was stated for and appealing to the  populace for their votes. So, Patsy decided that the thing to do, since they had been old  friends, really she thought very old friends, wrote him a letter to say basically, &#8220;Hey  senator, look, you remember your good friend Harry Clarke who helped you in western  North Carolina all these years? I don&#8217;t think you knew it, but we had a son who was gay  and he just died a short time ago with AIDS. Could you sort of just let up a little bit on  how you&#8217;re hurting these people?&#8221; And he wrote back a letter that essentially said, &#8220;It&#8217;s  your son&#8217;s own fault that he got this. He was playing Russian roulette with his  sexuality.&#8221; And that just speaks for itself. In other words, he turned her off in a very  blunt and a most hurtful way. And we read that letter and we cried and we talked about  it&#8230; it&#8217;s so painful. And we decided that it just wasn&#8217;t right to just let him slide on into  another election, which he seemed to be doing in the United States Senate, without some  opposition. So, at that point, I had been working with AIDS Service Agency in Raleigh  ever since my son&#8217;s death and that had been about seven or five years earlier. And I  knew a lot of people who were working with AIDS and knew a lot of people who had  AIDS. And I happened to know a lot of mothers who had lost their sons to AIDS  because one thing I liked to do was to try to befriend these people because in those days  not everybody was sympathetic with you if you lost a son to AIDS. They would not talk  to you or didn&#8217;t want to talk about it or certainly not openly have you as a friend. So,  being with the AIDS Service Agency, I knew who they were (inaudible) and ask them to  have lunch with me or to meet with me in whatever way and just talk with a friend. So I  knew a lot of people. So I said, &#8220;Patsy, let&#8217;s just get a lot of these mothers who have lost  sons and when we have them together and just see what we might come up with.&#8221; And  so that&#8217;s sort of what we did. We decided to meet out at Patsy&#8217;s house and we had  cookies and tea and lemon aid or whatever and we asked them to come. And a lot of  them came from all around. From various counties around Wake County, Durham, and  down east, and Orange County and we ended up with a living room full people. And we  discussed this matter and everyone had read the letter and read his reply and so we  decided we would do something formerly against Jesse Helms in that &#8217;96 election. Of  course we never had any thought that we could change the election. We knew we  couldn&#8217;t do that. That was just too much money and too much power. But at least we  thought we could make a difference. And we thought that if we got into the election that  there might be other people across this state, or as it turned out across the country, who  would contribute to us or help us in whatever way they could to at least make some stand  and to point out to the people that this is what Jesse Helms stands for and it just really is  not right. And it ended up that we got emails from all over the country. Our cause was  written up in Time Magazine and People Magazine and various newspapers across the  country and a lot of support did come to us. And of course we didn&#8217;t change the election,  but it gave a lot of people a lot of comfort and a more positive feeling about themselves,  and about this cause, and about this matter, to be able to take part in an election against  Jesse Helms and what he was standing for at that point. And so, of course the election  came and went and we had lost but we didn&#8217;t lose with what we were trying to do  because we had succeeded in that part and we still feel that we did. And then we decided  that we needed to write the book. And actually we&#8217;d written the book before the election.  Backwards. Anyhow, we wrote it. Patsy and I wrote the book, Keep on Singing. And it  5  was a story of what we had done in the campaign and the friends that we made all around  the United States. And too we were just having our own personal stories. If you put a  face onto what had been numbers, statistics, there were this many who were gay or this  many people who are sick with AIDS, there are this many people who have died, if you  could make it real in the story of your own family and your own child and tell about your  own reaction to it and your own family&#8217;s reaction and the impact that it had on your  family, it would make it more real because a lot of people, I think hadn&#8217;t, if they had not  been touched by AIDS or did not have a gay family member still would just whether not  think about this and think about other things. So we wrote the book for that purpose also.  RF: Okay (laughs). Let&#8217;s see. Well, you mentioned that the &#8217;96 election did not  have the outcome that you&#8217;d hoped for, but I&#8217;d think you would agree that MAJIC was  pretty affective in many ways.  EV: In the sense, I said, that it did bring a part, that it brought to people&#8217;s  attention one of Jesse Helm&#8217;s leading arguments about why he needed to represent the  people in the Senate again. And that is a reason that people do need to be made more  aware of. And so in that sense, yes.  RF: And, of course, y&#8217;all weren&#8217;t the first people to say this, but I get the idea that  y&#8217;all were just so loved by everybody. They wanted you to come speak. Why do you  think that MAJIC was so effective?  EV: Because we were actual, we were the actual mothers. And, in fact, we used  to say, &#8220;Everybody has or had a mother.&#8221; And in most cases it&#8217;s the most important  person in your life. We were the mothers of these young me who had died and we had  experienced personally. And we knew, with a sense that you can&#8217;t get just by reading or  hearing somebody, what being gay means, what it means to be gay, and what it means to  have a fatal disease and to die. We were the mothers. And that carried a special load,  cache.  RF: Did you ever directly meet Senator Helms or have any direct contact with  him?  EV: Never during that time. I met him in earlier days with my husband when we  were in Raleigh and would be attending large affairs. And I remember one night he came  running across, because he knew who my husband was although we were in opposite  parties, to take my coat at some reception at an art museum. And I remember that very  well. But never on personal terms.  RF: Right, right. Well, of course you already had an idea of what Senator Helms  was like from WRAL.  EV: Oh yes. And the papers.  RF: And the papers.  6  EV: And in the news magazines. I mean, if you lived in this country and didn&#8217;t  have your head under a rock, you knew about Helms (laughter).  RF: Right. Okay. I know from reading &#8220;Keep Singing&#8221; and from also talking  with Ms. Clarke that he tried to, you did a commercial.  EV: Yes.  RF: And apparently wasn&#8217;t able to get it on all the TV stations?  EV: We, it was played on the Durham station and it was played on different  stations around the state. We bought as much time as we could afford. We had received,  I can&#8217;t tell you the amount right now, but right much money in contributions which  allowed us to buy television time. But there was one station who, which refused to run it  because of its content.  RF: Do you remember which station that was?  EV: I believe it was Greensboro.  RF: Greensboro?  EV: It was in Greensboro, because I think it even ran on WRAL in Raleigh, his  old station. It was the Greensboro station.  RF: Yes.  EV: But they didn&#8217;t even want to take our money to take our money to buy the  time.  RF: It&#8217;s implied a little bit in &#8220;Keep Singing&#8221; and certainly Mrs. Clarke implied  this; that she thought that some of the political bigwigs who were tied with Helms or  Helms directly had some sway over what got played on the air.  EV: There&#8217;s no doubt about that. There&#8217;s no doubt about that. Right. I&#8217;m sure of  it.  RF: Wow. So, I guess it means, in a way, that&#8217;s a form of intimidation I guess.  EV: Yes.  RF: Were you ever, as far as being a member of MAJIC, were you ever  intimidated in any other kind of way?  EV: No, not really.  7  RF: Good.  EV: Uh-huh. We expected it. Only in the sense that we got some hate mail.  Nobody threatened us if that&#8217;s what you mean. We were never threatened but we did get  hate mail. And I don&#8217;t know if Patsy told you about one in particular that came from  Oxnard, California and it said &#8220;You mothers,&#8221; it said something to this affect, I have a  copy of it here, &#8220;ought to hush and accept that fact that your sons are&#8230;&#8221; Oh, what was  the word that they used? Not misfits, it was worse than that. I can&#8217;t always bring up the  words I want right out. It was a word worse than misfits. And just go on and accept that  and to be quiet. And so we got some feedback like that.  RF: Um, yes?  EV: I can&#8217;t think of the word I&#8217;m looking for.  RF: You know, I think she did tell me.  EV: Okay.  RF: I was trying to think of it while you were talking, but it can&#8217;t come to me  either (laughs). Um, deviants? No.  EV: No.  RF: It will come to one of us here in a little bit. But, um, well, so some hate mail  and a little bit of intimidation about the commercial. Let&#8217;s talk about support. You had  lots of support.  EV: We did. And we had a big rally on the capital square in Raleigh that was,  there were swarms of people there. And we conducted it like an old-time church social.  We had a bake sale and we had all the mothers lined up with a little script to read on the  microphone.  RF: Was this the Mother&#8217;s Day?  EV: It was the Saturday before Mother&#8217;s Day. That&#8217;s right.  RF: Okay. Okay.  EV: Oh, and we had a big, big card about eight feet tall that Patsy and I had put  together and lined around with wallpaper and a place for people to sign. It had a slick  surface so you could write on it with felt-tipped pens. And a lot of people came and  wrote their special Mother&#8217;s Day messages to Jesse (laughter). And that was very, very  interesting. Everybody, just about, signed the card to Jesse. And it was our intention to  deliver to his office. But we never did quite get it to his office. It was big and it was hard  8  to carry around. But, we ended up taking that thing, as hard as it was, to all of our rallies  in Winston-Salem, in Greenville, North Carolina, in Greensboro where we went. And  people signed it wherever we went. There were hundreds of signatures on there with  special messages for the senator. We got a big kick out of that. We had a big rally on the  courthouse square in Greenville, North Carolina. I remember that the press covered it. A  lot of people came from that part of the state. A lot of people came and made speeches  for us and that was good. We were invited to various political gatherings around the state  where people would pass the hat for us. And I remember one in Greensboro that we went  to in somebody&#8217;s garage. It was a big garage out in the backyard. It tended to be a bit  rainy that night. They had food and drink and a lot, a lot of people there. I think they  passed the hat that Saturday evening and we ended it with three thousand dollars that we  didn&#8217;t have before we went. And we met so many people there. And so many younger  people, gay, men and women, would come up to us and say things like, &#8220;Thank you so  much for what you&#8217;re doing. My mother or my father or my parents are not in a position  to speak up. But they would if they could. So thank you because you&#8217;re doing this and I  just wish it were my parents doing it (inaudible). I wish my parents were doing this. I  wish my mother could say this.&#8221; It touched a lot of people and I hope that it have them  hope and courage.  RF: Well, I think you know that it did.  EV: Hope so.  RF: Are your, well, from the politicians and folks like that, did you have anybody  body from either the national or the North Carolina level that came out to support you  all? Say, any Democrats or I would say Republicans, but that&#8217;s less likely.  EV: No, remember this is still &#8217;96 and the state Party was not ready to recognize  us. As a matter of fact, we were invited to the Democratic Convention in Chicago that  year. And we went. We were invited, as we understood it, to take part in everything  there. And the first morning we went to the Democratic breakfast in one of the hotels.  And we were sitting there with a couple of people who came with us. And a very nice  young man come over to speak to us, a very nervous young man. And he said, &#8220;Mrs&#8230;&#8221;  Oh, what was her name? She was chair of the Democratic Party in North Carolina at that  time. Said, &#8220;We&#8217;re very glad to have you. Please help yourself to the breakfast. Stay as  long as you want to. But please don&#8217;t speak to the press.&#8221; So, they still considered it&#8230; I  took it personal at the time. I think that they, at that point, did not dare to let the  Democratic Party be seen as being friendly to gay causes or to anything that had to do  with AIDS. It was still a third rail subject. You touched it at the fear of your political  life. I really do think that. So officially we were not recognized. But we were invited to  many, many events surrounding the Democratic Convention. There&#8217;s a lot of other  people go there during that time, because people are there from all over the country and  around the world for their meetings. And we had a lot of interesting experiences meeting  people and being a part of those meetings and then speaking to those meetings. And we  were also invited to take part in Washington, DC a gay coming out day and a parade. It  was a big weekend. And we were at the speech, down at a big stage that was set up in  9  Washington Monument. That was a very impressive time. It turned out to be a funny  time. We were spotted in the crowd by someone who was running the whole&#8230; it was  sponsored by the Human Rights Commission.  RF: Yes.  EV: Campaign.  RF: Campaign, yea.  EV: And the director knew us personally and she saw us as we got down to the  front right behind the rope that was keeping the crowd back. And she came down and  said, &#8220;Y&#8217;all come up here. I want you to speak.&#8221; And we said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; So we went up  there and I said, &#8220;Oh my gosh.&#8221; There were hundreds of people out there. It was getting  night and spotlights came on. And I said, &#8220;Oh lord Patsy, what are we going to say  (laughter)?&#8221; She said, &#8220;You just let me do the talking. You stand right here by my right  side and when I look at you, you take over.&#8221; And so we didn&#8217;t know when we were  going to go on, we didn&#8217;t know what we were going to say, we didn&#8217;t know how long we  were going to be aloud to say it when we got there because the people running the  gathering came over and said, &#8220;Y&#8217;all have five minutes. Five minutes. I don&#8217;t know that  you&#8217;ll get five minutes. But we may have five minutes. We&#8217;ll tell you when to go on.  Stand right here.&#8221; And so then he&#8217;d come over and say, &#8220;Well, Cher is supposed to speak  to us.&#8221; Cher&#8217;s daughter, you know, is gay. And so Cher was going to be one of the  quote, unquote big stars, big names to speak. So he&#8217;d come over and say, &#8220;Y&#8217;all are  gonna have about fifteen or twenty minutes it looks like. Because Cher is um, Cher&#8217;s car  is held up in the D.C. traffic. She just can&#8217;t get here. So we&#8217;re give you maybe twenty  minutes, as long as it takes to get Cher here. We said, &#8220;Oh my gosh!&#8221; And then it would  change again. It&#8217;d be shorter.  RF: Right.  EV: So finally Cher did show. They brought her across the field and up into the  stage. And we had not spoken yet so we were standing there in our place where we had  been told to stand, watching it all. It was outdoors. I remember that she was surrounded  by great big body guards in black leather outfits. They were huge men. They must have  been pro football players or something. They were giants. And I said to Patsy, &#8220;They  look like refrigerators.&#8221; Because they were so big. But they were her body guards. And  they got her on stage. And she was essentially very laid back in her approach and her  talk. And she said something to the effect, she spoke for a real short length of time,  &#8220;When I heard that my daughter, Chastity, was gay, I didn&#8217;t know what to think.&#8221; And  she shrugged her shoulders back and she said, &#8220;But I&#8217;m okay with it.&#8221; And that was  essentially the main thing that she said (laughter). So they took Cher down and finally it  was our chance to speak. And maybe we did have five minutes. But that was a very  interesting time. Very interesting time. Oh, and then we, oh, I know what it was. It was  when they had, the quilt was laid out on the Mall between the capital and the White  House. The Mall was completely covered by the quilt. They put it out in the morning  10  and they took it in at night. There were over forty-three thousand, I think at that point,  quilt pieces. And Patsy and I went down. That&#8217;s what took us there to start with. And  we did find our sons&#8217; quilts. It was very well-run and very well laid out. And we found  our sons&#8217; sections. We actually, and different people came down during the day and read  all the names. I remember Tipper Gore came down and she read for a length of time.  Bill Clinton came and read for a length of time. Hillary Clinton read for a length of time.  I think it was while Tipper Gore was reading that we actually heard Patsy&#8217;s son&#8217;s name  read, which is really something considering that there were so many thousands. It was a  very moving experience. There was a ceremony for laying the quilt out and for rolling it  up again, which they do every morning and every evening. That was very impressive.  And it was complete silence around that quilt on the Washington Mall. There was silence  (brief pause). Except for sobs (long pause while Vaughn collects her emotions).  RF: Did you do your son&#8217;s quilt?  EV: With some friends. He had some friends in Raleigh. One in particular who  is a commercial artist. And for several years after Mark&#8217;s death, I didn&#8217;t think that I  could sum up enough of his life to put up on a six by four piece of clothe. And one day I  was, one night I couldn&#8217;t sleep and I was just thinking through the verses and the words  of an old hymn. It was "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee&#8221; by Beethoven, words by&#8230; oh  my God, who was that? And it came to me, it&#8217;s in the third verse, &#8220;all who live and love  are thine,&#8221; to that effect, that particular verse of that song. And I thought, &#8220;That is it.  That is it. That goes on Mark&#8217;s quilt.&#8221; And so I called up Mark&#8217;s friend who was a  commercial artist. And he said, &#8220;Oh, Eloise that is really good.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Can you get  me a piece of paper that has Mark&#8217;s signature on it? The way he wrote it? A real piece  of paper with his signature on it?&#8221; And I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; And so I went up into a file that I  kept with Mark. On one of his medical papers, he&#8217;d signed it off, &#8220;Mark F.&#8221; for Mark  Foster Vaughn, &#8220;Mark F. Vaughn.&#8221; And so I took it to Tony, Tony Burden, and Tony,  back in those days, it was all magic to me, but he enlarged it and had it silk screened onto  a beautiful bright blue piece of cloth, Mark&#8217;s signature and then that verse from the hymn  underneath it. And that was his, that was his quilt square.  RF: Uh-uh. Stop tape? (Vaughn merely wanted to collect her thoughts about what  to say next without taking up tape. Within 20 seconds I restart the tape). Okay.  EV: To tell you about his quilt print; it, Tony, I took the signature and he silk  screened it onto there and then he took the line right out of the hymnbook and had it silk  screened onto the top of the square. And the line reads, &#8220;All who live and love are thine/  teach us how to love each other/ lift us to the joy divine.&#8221; And then he put a rest at the  end of that, that line. And there is no rest there in the real music and so we put down  under there, &#8220;The music played, and then it rested.&#8221; Because there&#8217;s not supposed to be a  rest there and it was not supposed to be a rest right there in Mark&#8217;s life (Vaughn walks  into the kitchen to pour herself a glass of water). So that&#8217;s that. So that&#8217;s how his quilt  came about. Patsy did her own square. It&#8217;s a real square. Did she show you the picture?  RF: Uh-uh. She did not.  11  EV: It&#8217;s a real, she pieced a quilt in. I&#8217;ve forgotten what it said, but it&#8217;s a real  square. And of course they are made from everything in the world. They are put  together in groups of eight. And I have here a picture of a group that Mark&#8217;s is a part of  (Vaughn holds up a picture of a section from the AIDS quilt). Here&#8217;s a pair of blue jeans  on one (laughter). There&#8217;s somebody who&#8217;d done a quilt square. All sorts of different  ideas. Somebody&#8217;s jacket is on one. So, it was a very fascinating thing.  RF: Is it still done on the Mall?  EV: It is stored, I don&#8217;t think they have had a showing of it, I think that&#8217;s the only time its  been showed together all at once because its so expensive. And they have to depend on  contributions to keep in going.  RF: Oh, right.  EV: And it&#8217;s all they can do to keep it stored, and air conditioned, and mended.  And what they do if an organization wants to show some of the quilts, is you get in touch  with them, they will send you which ever section of eight or two or three of those  sections that you want. And uh, you can have it sent to your school or your organization  or whatever and displayed. I have seen a section of it with Mark&#8217;s name, Mark&#8217;s section  displayed, I think it was out at the fairgrounds for a special event some years ago.  RF: Just at random?  EV: At the fairgrounds in Raleigh. Uh-huh, it was at random I think.  RF: Yea. Wow.  EV: But I found out it was there because they will let you know if a square with  your, uh your square is going to be shown because it&#8217;s crossed referenced and cross  referenced and so they know when it&#8217;s going to go where you are and they&#8217;ll let you  know so that you can be sure to go.  RF: Okay.  EV: So I have seen it in Raleigh once. And I saw part of it somewhere else.  Maybe out at Mary&#8217;s College or somewhere? But that&#8217;s the only time that Mark&#8217;s has  been shipped to North Carolina to my knowledge. They have a hard time raising money  and I&#8217;m not sure they can do this to the extent that they used to.  RF: Okay. Okay.  EV: Which is shame.  RF: Yes.  12  EV: It&#8217;s an eloquent spokesman again, it brings, it makes names come alive  instead of just being statistics. It touches them with a bit of humanity.  RF: Um, did you see, or do you see MAJIC as a, I mean, you guys were a PAC,  but do you see MAJIC as a civil rights organization? A gay rights organization? Of  just&#8230; how would you describe MAJIC in those kind of terms?  EV: I think that it was a quasi-political gay rights organization.  RF: Okay.  EV: Yea, a political gay rights organization, I think would be the best way to  describe it.  RF: Okay, that makes sense. Um, oh, and I wanted to go back. Harvey Gantt was  running against Helms in ninety-six.  EV: Yea, Harvey Gantt was the Democratic nominee.  RF: And he wasn&#8217;t&#8230;  EV: And he was not elected, of course, because Jesse was elected for thirty&#8230;  thirty years.  RF: Seventy two to&#8230;  EV: Thirty years.  RF: Thirty years. To &#8217;02, yea. But Harvey Gantt never came and supported you  all openly?  EV: No, not really. Although we were invited, at one time he came to Raleigh for  a big rally, one very hot sunny afternoon that spring, I remember. And we went. We, I  don&#8217;t remember that we were invited to speak or do anything like that. But we were  invited to go. And I can&#8217;t remember what Patsy and I did but we gathered up lots and  lots of our friends and we went. And it was on the campus of um, of um, Saint Mary&#8217;s, I  believe.  RF: Okay.  EV: The college there in Raleigh.  RF: In Raleigh, uh-huh.  13  EV: I think that&#8217;s where it was. And we went. But, and so he knew we were out  there. And we had asked him to come. Actually, we had, and I remember now, we had  asked him to come to the rally on capital square in Raleigh on that Saturday before  Mother&#8217;s Day. And for whatever reason they never could seem to work it in. They  couldn&#8217;t seem to work it into his schedule. So he wasn&#8217;t there. But he was invited and  did reply to us. But in talking to his managers, they could not seem to get him there for  that time slot for that Saturday afternoon.  RF: Okay. Okay.  EV: But they knew about us.  RF: Um, did you ever have any desire, or do you now have any desire to speak to  Senator Helms, face to face, like across the kitchen table, or&#8230;?  EV: Well, it would be, of course we know that health is gone now.  RF: Sure, sure.  EV: And that will never be possible. In those days, I think that we would have  liked to. I&#8217;m not sure that he would have deigned to speak with us. It, I just don&#8217;t think  he would have. He would have been so busy, whatever. I don&#8217;t think he would have.  And I think that he would have had to get a little bit embarrassed by Patsy, the widow of  the friend who helped him so much in western North Carolina, had helped him until  Patsy&#8217;s husband was killed in a plane crash. He helped him until he died in that plane  crash. I just think he&#8217;d been a little bit embarrassed. I don&#8217;t know that, but, no we never  spoke to him, never saw him personally.  RF: Are you, since MAJIC, since ninety-six, have you been involved in any other  organizations that work for this type of thing?  EV: I&#8217;m a member of several gay rights organizations, Human Rights Campaign,  GLADD, Gays and Lesbians Against&#8230; whatever.  RF: Yea, I don&#8217;t know what the &#8220;D&#8221; stands for.  EV: But I send them money. And two or three other things that, you know,  actively, myself, personally no. Though I&#8217;ll send them contributions. My heart is  certainly with all of them. We did stay active in Human Rights Campaign for several  years after that and attended their annual dinner meeting here in North Carolina once in  Charlotte. Over in Greensboro a couple of times and met a lot of people there. Oh God,  there&#8217;d be hundreds of people there, but they had people from Washington and different  places around the country. But no, personally not anymore. I will always be a Democrat.  I&#8217;ll always be voting on the side of people who are working for justice in this area as well  as many other areas too, but right now, this stage is in my life, that&#8217;s about the extent of  it.  14  RF: Yep, yep. What do you think MAJIC&#8217;s biggest success was?  EV: In giving voice to people like those that I mentioned earlier who would come  up to us at rallies, and&#8230; Oh, that night in Washington people just, they just overwhelmed  us with wanting to hug us. They&#8217;d stick money in our hands and in our pockets. Giving  voice to those people who don&#8217;t have a voice. And we&#8217;re just ordinary, run-of-the-mill,  everyday people, they could see us coming from normal families, middle class America,  not be on the fringe of anything. Speaking up for them, I think that was the most  important thing that we did.  RF: Okay. What did MAJIC mean to you personally?  EV: It did, it was an outlet for the anger that I felt at Jesse Helms. I spoke of the  extreme anger that I had against him, and what he stood for, and how he was cynically  using people for his own aggrandizement. It gave me a great deal of satisfaction to be  able to do something against that. And it gave me a great deal of satisfaction to stand up  for my son and say, &#8220;My son was who he was and he was as good as anybody else in this  world and deserves to be remembered as a very good, loving, honest, hard-working,  caring person.  RF: In, I guess, in the next election, Helms decided not to run again, but before he  announced was there any talk of getting MAJIC back together?  EV: Um, at that point, no because I had begun spending a lot of time up here in  the mountains for one thing and I was away from Patsy. So we weren&#8217;t together as much  as we were. The mother&#8217;s were getting older and some of us have died. So the core  group is not there anymore and was not there. And I think I lot of the new organizations,  especially Human Camp&#8230; uh, Human Rights Campaign and other organizations are  better organized now. Some of them were not so strong back then, especially in this  state. That we have big national organizations who can speak better than us now and  speak to a larger audience and in a lot of ways that just weren&#8217;t possible back then, and I  think they are doing a very good job of it (clock chimes loudly in background).  RF: (Laughs) It&#8217;s alright.  EV: And we&#8217;re still, we&#8217;re happy if we can make a difference, but you know,  Patsy is older than I am. I am pushing seventy-five right now. Our day was right then, to  do that.  RF: Yea.  EV: I think it was. I think we&#8217;ve passed it on now to other organizations who are  doing a good job and have a good following.  15  RF: Speaking of the mothers, real fast, I noticed that it&#8217;s always you and Mrs.  Clarke at the forefront, you know, at the podium, at the microphone. Were the other  mothers, I know they were usually there and supported you by their presence, but did  they ever want to talk or did the group understood that it was you two?  EV: They, well, it was our baby. We got the thing up. We got the thing started.  We got it organized. We made all the lists. We began to try to raise money and reach out  and wrote lots of letters and did the traveling because a lot of them were not in any  position to do the traveling which Patsy and I were which we did and we&#8217;re very glad that  we could. But a lot of them just weren&#8217;t in that situation to do that. So I think they saw  us as their spokeswomen, their spokesperson, and were very happy to support us in the  ways that they could. They had never been schooled, that&#8217;s not the right word, but they&#8217;d  never been experienced in doing this sort of thing at all. And so they were happy for us  to try to take that own. They did appear in the ad that we made. They all came to my  house for a photograph on my sun porch in that ad that appeared on TV. They were  happy for us to use their support anyway we could. But I think Patsy and I, as I say,  spokespersons for that.  RF: Okay. Mind if I look at my question list to make sure I didn&#8217;t miss anything?  I have twenty-five questions. And my tapes about to run out so I&#8217;m going to flip the tape  here.  END OF TAPE 1, SIDE A  START OF TAPE 1, SIDE B  (While I flip the tape, Vaughn and I debate whether or not she should speak on tape about  her religious experiences after her son died. She quickly decides that it is a pertinent  portion to the full story)  RF: Okay, this is the start of side B for this tape. And, Ms. Vaughn, you were just  talking about your religious experience through MAJIC, so if you want to talk about that.  EV: Well, I think that to finish telling my story completely I have to mention to  you what it did cause, in a religious way, in my life because your religious, your spiritual  side is one of the most important parts of you, it&#8217;s a central core part. And I think that  going through the experience with Mark, and Mark having AIDS, I had been a member  of the Methodist Church since I was born. My parents were strong church members. I  was told I was taken to church when I was just a week or two old and laid on the bench  beside my parents. Church was a very important part to me and always had been.  Wherever my husband and I lived, we immediately joined, and he was a Methodist too,  we joined the church and did what we could. I wouldn&#8217;t say we were there every time  the church doors opened, but we were members of the church. And in Raleigh we had  joined the Methodist Church. I had been the board of administration twice, very active in  Women&#8217;s Society of Christian Service, which is what they call the women&#8217;s group, been  president, done all the work that you do through the women&#8217;s group. And felt very, just  felt, you know, that was a, that was just an important part of my life. When Mark got  16  sick I remember asking the minister of my church, several times, &#8220;Please come to see us.  Please come to see us.&#8221; He came twice. I don&#8217;t think he wanted, I know he didn&#8217;t want  to come. The assistant minister did come two or three times. Now, Mark was sick, in  bed, for eighteen months at my house. He was absolutely bedridden for eighteen months.  Another minister who had had a Methodist Church came, but the minister who came the  most and who meant the most to me was a Catholic priest. And I don&#8217;t know if you  remember reading about this in the book, but he was the priest at one of the largest  Catholic churches in Raleigh, he was sent to me by a friend in Raleigh that I&#8217;d gotten to  know because of the illness of her son. I&#8217;d gotten to know him through my doctor who  referred me to her. And she just said to me one day, &#8220;Eloise, would you like for Father  Ingham to come by and give Mark a blessing?&#8221; And I just thought, &#8220;Well, we need all  the blessings we can get.&#8221; And this was early on in Mark&#8217;s illness. And so the Father  came and he gave Mark a blessing. And he asked if he could come back and I said, &#8220;Yes,  whenever you want to.&#8221; So, it started out that he came about once a week and then he  came twice a week, and he came maybe three time, and then he came absolutely every  single day. And all during the time that Mark was so sick and was actually dying, our  house, my house was never, the doors were never closed and never locked. And if he  were busy at church or had confessions or he had a wedding or whatever he was doing,  he would always show up before the night was over to go up and spend some time with  Mark. He gave Mark the Last Rights. He was the most important person to Mark during,  during that time and I wouldn&#8217;t take anything for it because you do need to have some  spiritual feeding, very badly, especially in a time like that. I did not get it from my  church, all this to say. And after Mark was gone, I began to take a look at the church and  where they stood because then churches were getting to talk about the gay issue more.  And was we know now, churches have split. The Baptists have split. The Methodists  and Presbyterians are very much, they haven&#8217;t formerly split, but they are, there&#8217;s great&#8230;  RF: Division  EV: Division in the churches. Division in the churches. And just about every  church you can name too, except one or two. And so I just took a look at it and I thought,  you know, &#8220;If that&#8217;s what the church is about and they cannot recognize and love  someone because he happens to be born differently from what they are or from what they  think they are, how can they possibly set themselves up to church?&#8221; And then I began to  look at the Bible and what they were pulling out of the Bible to use as their justifications.  And it made me look at the Bible in a different way too because there are a lot of things  in the Bible that you can&#8217;t just take out piece by piece. You can&#8217;t just lift them and say,  &#8220;Oh, this is what we&#8217;re going to live by.&#8221; The Bible is meant to be seen as a whole. And  it made me question my whole faith. I questioned everything. How in the world do we  say the things that we say in the church? The creeds? I mean, where do they come from?  Who wrote those? I began to think, &#8220;I just can&#8217;t be a part of this anymore.&#8221; And so I  stopped going to church, didn&#8217;t ever intend to again. And so I moved up here in the  mountains and I as invited to go to a small church out in the valley, Valle Crucis, a sweet  little rock church out there where people don&#8217;t think that way about their religion and  about the Bible. They see it, they see as a whole, they see the Bible as a whole which  speaks of love and forgiveness and acceptance. And I decided that I can be a part of that  17  church and now I am. And it is an Episcopal Church. And I know that the Episcopalians  are in the midst of a great divisive argument right now too. But I just think the American  wing of the Episcopal Church is going to come out of this alright in the end. And I am  glad to be a part of it.  RF: We were talking earlier, actually over lunch, that Vernon Tyson had also  come and, a few times&#8230;  EV: Yes, Vernon is an old friend. Vernon&#8217;s father was a minister of the church  that I was a member of back in, what is now Chapel Hill, northern Chapel Hill, the outer  limits of Chapel, when I was a child, and he was a young boy. He was maybe just two or  three years older than I am, or three or four. And his father had a great house full of  boys, five I remember. And they all became Methodist ministers.  RF: You&#8217;re right.  EV: And Vernon, he was a young man there. I remember his mother and his  father very well. I remember going into their house where they lived in the parsonage in  Carrboro. And who would believe it, but when I became a member at Edenton Street  United Methodist Church in Raleigh, many, many years later, Vernon was sent there as a  minister for several years. So we became reacquainted again and it was wonderful to  have is acquaintance again, to get to know him. And he was so good and wonderful to  my husband when he was dying with cancer. That was the time that Vernon was the  minister of the church, during the death and the illness, the cancer. And Vernon was  expressively good and expressively kind to us both and helped us both so very much.  And so I will always love Vernon and he has a special place in my heart. And anything I  say about the Methodist Church does not include Vernon (laughter).  RF: I&#8217;m sure he would understand that. I&#8217;m sure that goes without saying.  EV: He&#8217;s an exception (laughter).  RF: Okay. Well, is there anything else that I haven&#8217;t asked that you would want  to add to this story?  EV: No, I think we&#8217;ve covered it pretty well. I think so.  RF: Okay. Well, thank you very much for&#8230;  EV: Well, it&#8217;s been a pleasure to talk to you and I&#8217;ve gotten completely into it  now. It&#8217;s going to take me a while to unwind (laughter).  RF: We can always just turn the tape back on if you think of anything else. But  thank you very much for having me up here.  18  EV: I&#8217;ve enjoyed having you so much Rob. And it&#8217;s a pleasure meeting you and I  look forward to meeting you more and hearing about you and keeping up with you.  RF: Yes, absolutely.  EV: As you go forward with your education and become a doctor and I hope that  you do, maybe sometime, come in this part of the state to live. It&#8217;s a great university over  there. And you know its approaching sixteen thousand, maybe already is sixteen  thousand, members of the student body. I think I&#8217;m right in saying that. So it&#8217;s a great  place to be. It&#8217;s very exciting. I don&#8217;t know, the man that lives across the street was a  professor there. It&#8217;s a very exciting place to be. He&#8217;s a tenured professor. He&#8217;s in, not,  computer science and he travels the world and looks after exchange students from around  the world who come here and their about to adopt a baby from Guatemala because of his  visits down there. And it&#8217;s just an exciting place to be.  RF: Yea.  EV: And this new chancellor Peacock is extremely well&#8230;
