Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay. What about a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess from the Honorable Marcus Garvey and the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, "Up you mighty nation; you can accomplish what you will."
Story_ID: 633800
Speaker 1: I wanna start out by asking you about your mother.  And if you could give her name and what you know about her growing up, sir?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Mae Clarke [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke], and she became a Muslim follower of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and her name was changed to Sumayyah Farrakhan.  She grew up--her first eleven years on the island of St. Kitts in the British West Indies.  And at the age of eleven, her mother and father moved to the island of Bermuda.  And she became a young woman in Bermuda.  She married her first husband in 1918, I believe it was.  And in the great flu epidemic of 1919, he perished.  And I had an older sister whose name was Iris [ph.] who also passed away.  And so my mom had a, a life--growing up was difficult because her mother always wanted a boy.  And she said when she came forth from her mother's womb, and it was seen that she was a girl, trouble began for her.  So she was not very well accepted, but was a brilliant woman.  She left Bermuda in 1919, and she came to the United States through Ellis Island [New York, New York].  And she was an excellent seamstress, but she worked many odd jobs.  She worked in Atlantic City [New Jersey] in, in New York [New York].
Story_ID: 633801
Speaker 1: Then she [Farrakhan's mother, Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] met my father [Percival Clarke], and they married.  And I was born to her in 1933.  She was thirty-three years old at the time.  She was born January 16th, 1900.  And she reared my brother [Alvan Walcott] and me, and by the time I was going toward my third birthday, she took my brother and me to the island of Bermuda so I could meet her mother, my grandmother and grandfather.  And I remember the beauty of the island of Bermuda on my third birthday.  And I remember going over to Bermuda on a ship called the Monarch [ph.].  And it was very frightening to hear the sound of the ship horn when they were getting ready to leave the pier in New York [New York].  And I remember, of course, the beauty of our little quarters and the ship.  And my grandmother had a horse and surrey and a beautiful little home.  And I remember the horse, called Cherry [ph.], and the surrey taking us to church on Sunday and a beautiful smell of the grass.  I think it's, the native people call it sweet grass.  And from her veranda I could look out and see the Atlantic Ocean.  So Bermuda has a place in my life.  My father was from Jamaica, and my mother from the island of St. Kitts.  So the Caribbean has a great, I have a great love for the Caribbean, the people of the Caribbean.  And, of course, we came back to the United States in 1934, and we took up residence in the City of Boston, Massachusetts, and that's where my early life was.
Story_ID: 633802
Speaker 1: Can you give your father's name, sir?
Speaker 2: Yes, his name was Percival, P-E-R-C-I-V-A-L, Clarke, C-L-A-R-K-E [Percival Clarke] from the beautiful island of Jamaica, Kingston.
Speaker 1: And do you much about his growing up?
Speaker 2: Very little.  He had no influence in my life at all.  My mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] reared my brother [Alvan Walcott] and, and me all by herself.  So I don't have hardly any memory of my father, and, but I honor him.
Story_ID: 633803
Speaker 1: Can you describe your mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] to us?
Speaker 2: Yes, a very beautiful, dark skinned, black woman of immense strength and racial pride.  My father [Percival Clarke] was a follower of Marcus Garvey.  My mother never joined the movement, but being so close around him and it, she had strong, strong racial pride.  And all my life with her, she was a woman of immense strength, dignity, pride, hard working, making no excuses.  And she demanded that of my brother [Alvan Walcott] and me.
Story_ID: 633804
Speaker 1: Now, your brother's name?
Speaker 2: Alvan, A-L-V-A-N [Alvan Walcott].  His father [Louis Walcott], different from mine, but we never used the term half brother in our house.  My mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] always wanted us to see each other as full brothers.  So that term, I never heard it in my home, and I never looked at my brother, though he had a different father, as a half brother.  He was my brother, and I was his.
Speaker 1: Now, what was his, his birth date?
Speaker 2: He was born October the 11th, 1931.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was two years older than you.
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Story_ID: 633805
Speaker 1: Do you know why your family, why your mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] moved to Boston [Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: We had some cousins in Boston and getting a new start for herself and her children [Farrakhan and Alvan Walcott], she thought that the best place to go would be where we had family.  So we had at least two families there in Boston that we were related to, and I'm sure they were comforting to her after her leaving Bermuda.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now the, did you, during your time, would you go spend other time in Bermuda or was it that one trip that you remember (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 633806
Speaker 1: Can you give me your earliest memory of growing up in, you know, in Boston, in Roxbury [Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: Sure.  I have many early memories.  When I was either four or five, we were living on Shawmut Avenue right across the street from a funeral parlor, J.B. Johnson's funeral parlor [J.B. Johnson Funeral Home, Boston, Massachusetts].  And in those days, when someone passed, there would be a card on the outside of the funeral parlor that stated who was on the inside so you could come by and read the different cards and know who passed and when their funeral would be and where.  Well, as a young boy across from a funeral parlor, Mr. J.B. Johnson [James B. Johnson] was such a magnificent member of the community.  He would always dress in top hat and tails, and you would see him literally, as a funeral director, but almost like the drum major of a parade because he, he was just, just that kind of charismatic personality.  And I could always go across the street and go in the funeral parlor--I couldn't--I was always afraid of the bodies so I wouldn't go past his office.  But he always had a nickel, a dime or even a quarter.  And when I was young, I mean, my god, if you had a nickel, what you could buy for a nickel, you can't buy for a dollar today.  So, but he was always kind and loving to me.  But the thing that I remember is that I would sit on my stoop and look across the street, and when the funeral was over, I would see the people coming out and just weeping and wailing.  And I would sit on my stoop and cry for their pain because as early as I can remember I was always feeling the pain of others and a very sensitive child.  And Mr. Johnson married a young woman [Marjorie Johnson], and he passed away.  And my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] took me to his funeral at, he was--I think it's Concord Baptist Church in Boston.  And this beautiful wife of his took over the funeral parlor and grew it.  And when my mother passed, she was funeralized here in Chicago [Illinois], but then we took her body back to Boston, and the wife of Mr. J.B. Johnson was the funeral director of my mother's home going.  And she recently passed away.  But we maintained good, loving friendships.
Speaker 1: Now the, you said you lived on Shawmut Avenue?  Is that what you said?  Do you remember the address?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't.
Story_ID: 633807
Speaker 1: Sir, let me ask you, can you describe the block that you grew up on?  I know that Mr. Johnson [James B. Johnson] was across the, the street.
Speaker 2: Well, it, it was like little row houses, closely connected to each other.  Our little house was so tiny, and I remember we had an oil, kerosene stove that we would heat the few little rooms with.  And I remember my brother [Alvan Walcott] playing around the stove, and he fell over the stove.  And he didn't have his undershirt on, and he couldn't pull himself up off of the stove.  And my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] pulled off of the stove and made a poultice.  What it was I don't know.  But she rubbed it on my brother's stomach, and when he passed away a few years ago, there was never a mark of that burn that he had.  My mother, we never went to the hospital.  The only time I went, I fell down and split my thumb.  It was hanging off, and my mother took me to the hospital to have it sewn.  But any time we got sick, my mother would go and get a bush here or something and make a tea.  So I never knew what a doctor's office looked like.  And I can truthfully say that I never went to bed hungry, and (cough) pardon me, she always, always cooked for us.  We had a hearty breakfast and lunch and dinner.  And no matter how poor we were, she knew how to make something out of nothing.  And so that was one of my memories.  And then we moved to another place on Columbus Avenue in Boston [Massachusetts].  And I know the number, 772.  I must have been five, six.  And I remember with the, with the Depression [Great Depression], WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration] was set up, and we would go and get milk and what not.  And she moved from there to another street called Westminster Street.  And we had a little apartment there.  And one of the memories was that somebody got shot in the vacant lot.  And that's the first time I had ever witnessed violence.  And I remember the pistol that was in the ambulance.  It was a pearl handled pistol.  And I don't know whether the person died on his way to the hospital, but that was traumatic for me to see a person shot so close to where I lived.  And, and we moved to our final address, again on Shawmut Avenue, where I--all my maturing years of grammar school, high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts], prep school and college [Winston Salem Teachers College; Winston Salem State University, Winston Salem, North Carolina], so.
Speaker 1: What was that address, sir?
Speaker 2: 687 Shawmut Avenue.
Story_ID: 633808
Speaker 1: Were there family around 'cause you, you said there were two, two relatives, you know, two--
Speaker 2: Cousins.
Speaker 1: --cousins of the family.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So were you, were they a part of your growing up?  Was there a lot of interaction with them or--
Speaker 2: Well, there was some.  My mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] was a very protective mother.  And although we had cousins, I don't remember any time that I was with my cousin that lived right across the street from us on Shawmut Avenue [Boston, Massachusetts], that I stayed overnight or spent long hours.  But it's just a visit from a cousin.  You say, hello; you sit down.  They may have a little something to share with you at the table or light conversation.  But, no, I didn't start really spending time with my other cousin until I was maybe thirteen, fourteen years of age.  But my childhood was very structured, very disciplined, and my mother watched over us like a mother hen would watch over its young, um-hm.
Speaker 1: So let's talk about that.  What was, let's talk about the structure of your family life.  What was it like?
Speaker 2: Well, you had a time to get up and a time to go to bed.  And, naturally, I'm in school, and at that time, you know, there were neighborhood schools.  You didn't have to go far to go to school.  My mother would wake us up in the morning.  We had an oil stove in our dining room, and, of course, a stove in the kitchen.  And she would take our underwear and put it over the stove and warm it so when we got up in the morning, the house was a little cold.  She had to get up and make the fire.  And I can truthfully say that in my growing up, I never hardly saw my mother in the bed.  When I got up, she was up.  When I went to bed, she was still up.  And the only time I could remember her being in the bed is if she were ill.  Other than that, no.  She was a hard working mother, very clean.  The little apartment that we had, every room, spotless.  And our beds always made.  I could open a dresser drawer and see white shirts and clean underwear and socks, one drawer after another.  She was a heck of a mother.  And I remember the breakfast that we used to have.  And I mean we were poor.  I'm not talking about a middle class family at all.  We were, well, some would say dirt poor, but we didn't know it because she knew how to make something out of nothing.
Story_ID: 633809
Speaker 1: And when I was five years old, she [Farrakhan's mother, Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] gave me the violin, and she said, "You're going to play this."  She gave my brother [Alvan Walcott] the piano.  I didn't wanna play no violin 'cause I thought, you know, that's a sissy instrument.  But she would put a clock up on the little table and set it for fifteen minutes when I first started playing.  And then she would move it to a half hour.  And then when I fell in love with the instrument, she never had to coax me to play anymore.  I would practice hours.  I had to do my homework.  And she worked as a domestic in the home of many white people.  But she never let her home go unattended because she worked in the home of white people to make enough money to give my brother and me, music lessons.  She was a tremendous seamstress.  And so when she would come home from working in, as a domestic in the home of others, of course, there was always my lunch.  Sometimes from school, I would come home when she was home.  I had my lunch, and then I would go back to school.  When I came home at 3:30 in the afternoon, about five o'clock, I would have my dinner.  She would let me go out and play, you know, but right in front of the door.  You don't go too far.  She would come and open the window and look out to make sure I was--I grew up in the Episcopal church.  And I was a member of the choir, and she would take me to church on Christmas Eve, New Year's and every Sunday.  In those days, you only bathed once a week.  You washed every day, but Saturday night, you would get in this big round tub when I was little.  And then, of course, at 687 Shawmut Avenue [Boston, Massachusetts], we had a bathtub so every Saturday, we would get a good scrub down, and Sunday morning, everybody would dress up.  And she would take her two boys to church [St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church, Boston, Massachusetts].  Church life was beautiful for me because there I met a lot of West Indian people.  It was a church that most of the people from the Caribbean were there.
Story_ID: 633810
Speaker 1: We're talking about, you know, your mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] and how, you know, even she watched over you in the neighborhood [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts].  I want you to, I want you to--'cause we were back there, and I wanna have you talk about what sights, smells and sounds remind you of your childhood growing up there?
Speaker 2: Well, the most profound memory is the sweet grass, and whenever I smell it, it takes me back to Bermuda.  Other than that, I don't have sights and sounds that--
Speaker 1: In Boston [Massachusetts]?  No?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, in those days, you look out your window, you see the cars going by.  And my brother [Alvan Walcott] and I would be at the window, my car, your car.  And then the horse would come by with the carriage, and there would be a man with a pushcart coming by selling or taking rags and things that you would want to throw away.  Those are the sounds.  And then in those days, we didn't have refrigerators.  You had what is called an icebox.  And you had to put a sign in your window of what kind of--what piece of, cut of ice would you want.  Is it fifteen cent, is it twenty-five cent, is it fifty cent, and based upon the size of your icebox, you would get, put the sign up.  So they would come by and we would have the sign in the window.  It usually was either a fifteen or twenty-five cent cut of ice.  And the man, I remember he would have a, I guess you would call it a plastic kind of thing on him.  And he would put, cut it and put the tongs on it, and put it on his back and bring it up and put it in the icebox.  Then the coal and wood man would come by, and you would go downstairs and pick up a twenty-five pound bag of coal and wood so that you could make your fire in the kitchen.  And so those were the sights and the sounds.  And, of course, you know, in those days when, when you lost your wife, the man would wear a black armband to let anybody that saw him know that he was in mourning.  And, of course, the woman dressed in black with a veil so you would know that she was in mourning.  And in those days, no one was permitted to interfere with a male or female when they were mourning.  In those days, you would never see a woman walking the street with a cigarette in her hand.  I mean there was such moral character.  It didn't mean that people didn't sin.  But the thing that we see in today's society, we never saw.
Story_ID: 633811
Speaker 1: Massachusetts was called a blue law state.  So on Sunday, there was no selling of alcohol.  There were no sporting events to go to on a Sunday, no.  Sunday was truly dedicated to the worship of God.  If you were Seventh-day Adventist, then you would go to your church on Saturday.  If you were Jewish, you would go to your synagogue on Friday night for Shabbat.  And in those days, I remember on Saturday mornings, we didn't have any television, so we had a little radio.  So I would listen to a great organist.  His name was E. Power Biggs.  I'm just a child.  And then, either before him or after him would come this singer.  I didn't know it was a Jewish cantor.  And every Saturday, I would listen though he was singing in Hebrew.  I didn't know what the language was, but the sound of the voice and the inflection always touched me.  And, of course, I was playing the violin then and gradually learning how to play and playing little pieces at the church and playing at my grammar school.  And that's the kind of growing up we had, and, of course, singing in the choir on Sunday.  And then after church, we'd go to the ice cream parlor with your friends and have an ice cream cone and meet some of the young ladies.  And it was never foul or low down.  It wasn't--it didn't mean you weren't attracted to a pretty young lady, but your behavior was such.  And then you were always under watch, meaning the older members of the church, you know, they would be there, you know, checking you out and reporting (laughter).  So your mother always knew when she wasn't there, there was another mother checking on her child.  And that's what made my growing up so very, very special.  And, of course, there, as a child, you know, in my Sunday school classes, you know, I would provoke my teacher because I would always ask questions when they would talk about Moses and delivering the children of Israel, talking about Daniel and what not.  And then I would always be upset in a sense with God, because if God could send deliverers for all these suffering people in the past, why hasn't he sent a deliverer for us?  And this was nurtured by my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] who bought the Afro American newspaper [Afro American Newspapers] for me to read, The Crisis magazine for me to read.  So I'm six and seven and eight year old and nine year old, feeding my mind on the pain and suffering of black people.  And, you know, in the Afro American, whenever there was a lynching, whenever there was something ugly going on, particularly in the South, we in the North would read it.  And, of course, with me, I would read it, but the pain of such was so great to me that my question always to God, "Why haven't you sent us somebody to deliver us?"  And so the church life was wonderful, the camaraderie was wonderful, the choir was wonderful, the choir mothers and how they would dress us with our little vestments, all of that was good.  But something was missing because the church never dealt with the suffering of black people.  And it was nice messages of Jesus and healing and all those kinds of things, but my heart was yearning to see a people free.
Story_ID: 633812
Speaker 1: Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], let me ask you, in the church, what was the history of the church?  Do you know the history?  It was St., is it St.--
Speaker 2: St. Cyprian--
Speaker 1: St. Cyprian.
Speaker 2: --Episcopal Church [St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church, Boston, Massachusetts].  No, I'm not so familiar with the history of the church.  I remember our pastor was Reverend Ferguson [David Leroy Ferguson], and I must have been four years at the church.  And evidently, I fell asleep, and (laughter) some sound woke me up.  And I looked up at the preacher and said, "Why don't he shut his damn mouth?"  (Laughter) And after the church service was over, the people (laughter) were just giving me money (laughter) for cussing the preacher out 'cause he was not a good preacher.  You know, he was a nice, kindly man, but it wasn't like a Baptist preacher, you know, just dry, you know.  So I didn't know real good preaching 'til I went to a Baptist church.  And then I understood what preaching was (laughter), but I never got that ever, growing up in my church.
Speaker 1: Well, Episcopalian is much more staid.
Speaker 2: Yes, it's like the Catholic church (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right, right, that's right.
Speaker 2: But anyway, that was my growing up.  We'll get back to that.  As I grow up, I would go back to my church at some point.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, there was a mention also--I had read about Ferguson, but there was a mention of a Nathan, a pastor, Nathan Wright [Nathan Wright, Jr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nathan Wright was the pastor after Reverend Ferguson, and Nathan Wright was the pastor that married my wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan] and me, fifty--fifty-five, fifty-seven years ago.
Speaker 1: Which is wonderful in and of itself (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Story_ID: 633813
Speaker 1: What were you like as a, as a young boy 'cause you said that you were sensitive. You (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Mischievous, you know, fun loving, but very serious, very, very serious (laughter).  I think about my girlfriends, when I was growing up, I never wanted the pain of falling in love with somebody and then somebody would come and take that person from me.  So I didn't gravitate too much to pretty girls.  I would gravitate toward somebody that I didn't think somebody would come (laughter) and take away from me (laughter).  I liked the pretty girls (laughter), but I didn't want the drama, even as a child, you know.  And when I learned, you know, singing in the choir and my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] and father [Farrakhan's biological father, Percival Clarke] from the Caribbean, then I wanted to learn to sing calypso.  So some of the great calypsonians would come to Boston [Massachusetts], and my mother would have them over after the dance or the concert for dinner and, you know, a nice social evening.  I liked the Duke of Iron [Cecil Anderson] and the Lord Invader [Rupert Westmore Grant], the man that wrote the Calypso 'Rum and Coca-Cola' which The Andrews Sisters stole from him, but he finally got paid.  But he would come to my house, and he would teach me how to sing calypso.  And that I loved, and then I found out that I had a voice, and I could sing ballads.  And then, at around fifteen, I began going into nightclubs.  And I wasn't hired, but I would go in and there was a trio playing, and I asked could I sit in.  And, "Yes, what did you wanna sing?"  Well, I was a great lover of Billy Eckstine.  And he was my favorite vocalist, male vocalist.  And so I would sing some of Mr. B's songs.  And one day I was singing at the Hi-Hat nightclub in Boston [Massachusetts], never at night, but in their matinees and what not.  And a man was sitting there, and after I finished singing, he invited me to his table.  And he said, "What are you drinking?"  And I said, "Oh, just a ginger ale."  I was about sixteen then.  And he said, "Well, I'm not paying a dollar fifty for a ginger ale," so, you know, I didn't get any drink.  And he said, "Look, young man," he said, he said, "if I wanted to hear Billy Eckstine, I would have gone some place where he was singing.  I came here tonight, and I wanted to hear you.  And I heard Mr. B."  So, you know, sometimes when you're growing up and you have a hero, you do your best to emulate, imitate their sound and mannerisms and what not.  So I asked him--and he was drunk, and I asked him, I said, "Well, I thought that I was singing like myself."  He said, "No, you were not."  I said, "Well, how can I sing like myself?"  He said, "Take the lyrics and express those words the way you feel and you'll be singing like yourself."  I don't know whether that man is living or dead, but his words had a profound effect on me.  And even though with my wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan], I met her when she was eight years old, and I was eleven, and it was just her brother and I were friends.  And he brought me home to his house during the lunch break, and I met her, nothing significant.  But when she was maybe twelve or thirteen, I saw her again, and she was so beautiful.  And now, I'm getting to fall for a beautiful, a black woman (laughter).  But I was so popular then, I wasn't worried about somebody taking my girl (laughter) 'cause all the girls wanted--oh, boy.
Story_ID: 633814
Speaker 1: So I wanna, I wanna go back a little bit to--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Your elementary school was what?  Where did you go for elementary school?
Speaker 2: The Sherwin School [Boston, Massachusetts].  I went first to the Asa Gray grade school [Asa Gray School, Boston, Massachusetts], and from kindergarten to the third grade, I was in a boy and girl type environment.  And I excelled in that environment.  But once I got to the fourth grade, I went to the Sherwin School.  And in Boston [Massachusetts], the boys went to one school and the girls went to another, and it, you'd stay, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth grades.  And there when I reached the sixth grade, my, my report card was like eleven A's, two Bs and one C.  I mean I was really, really, really progressing.  And so the best school in Boston was Boston public Latin school [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts].  And it was founded in 1635, one year before Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] was founded.  And so I went to Latin School in my seventh grade, and I started studying Latin.  This school, Latin School was such a fine school.  But, you know, I had never been in school with white children.  If there were one or two whites in the neighborhood where I went to grammar school [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts], they were insignificant in terms of their presence.  So all my friends were black. But when I went into that environment, I really saw the racism and hatred that other white students for black people.  So I didn't do so well in that environment because I really was a, a militant young fellow in the seventh grade.

Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Do you know how you came to go to that school?  Was that your mother's [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] doing?
Speaker 2: I think it was a combination of my mother and the teachers and advisors who thought that, you know, I was very special.  And they wanted to give me a first class education.  My mother was the type of woman, she wouldn't even let me do housework.  She said, "I'm doing that so you won't ever have to do that."  So when it was time to wash the windows or do this kind of things, she'd say, "You get in there and practice your violin because I never want you to have to work in somebody else's kitchen like your mother is doing."  So, okay, so the key then according to most of the conversation was, that you had to have a good education.  And in Boston [Massachusetts], if you wanted to go to college, you had a classical education.  So Latin and Greek was offered at Latin School [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts].  I wanted Latin more than Greek, and so I mean I had really tough courses.  And I wasn't doing as well in that environment as I was in the all-black environment.  And I remember I had a Dutch teacher, big fellow, Mr. Van Steinbergen [ph.].  And I'm in this man's class, and he made some mockery of my blackness and said, "Well, who's gonna speak next after sunshine here?"  And I had, I carried a knife to school with me because the environment was hostile, and I felt that maybe I would have to cut up a few people.  And I'm very serious.  So I took my knife out and went up to the man, sitting at his desk, and he had some papers on his desk.  And I drove the knife into the papers, into the desk.  I wanted to let him know, "Man, I don't appreciate you talking like that."  And if I had to, "I'll kill you."  Now, I'm a baby.  I'm a young man, but that's my spirit.  It's good for The HistoryMakers to know how you make history because it's circumstances.  It's stimulus in the environment that help to shape and form you.  Well, I wasn't formed to bow down to white supremacy.  That's never been in my life, never.  And I was born, evidently, to challenge it wherever I found it.  So I didn't do so good in that environment.  So I had to go back to my all-black school [Sherwin School, Boston, Massachusetts].  But I had a year of Latin under me.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you were there a year? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Not quite a year.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't finish the year out.
Story_ID: 633816
Speaker 1: So when I got back to my school [Sherwin School, Boston, Massachusetts], the math teacher--I can't remember the incident, but he, he lied on me.  And most of the teachers in the all-black school were white.  You didn't see no black teachers no where.  Everything was white, the police, the teachers, you know.  So you didn't have any black role models to look up to.  So that teacher lied on me and I threatened him.  I stood up in the class, and I told him I would kill him.  So they sent me immediately to the headmaster's office.  And when he heard that I had threatened the teacher, he said, "Well, you gotta bring your mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] up."  So I mean my mother is fierce, and that's a woman--I didn't really need a man in my life 'cause she was all the man I could handle.  I could never handle her, but I mean, she was strong.  And so I, I'm nervous because my mother has to hear that I threatened the teacher.  So the headmaster is there, and he says, "Louis, you have a very bad temper, and you're gonna have to learn to count to ten."  I said, "I'll count to ten, and then I'll kill him."  And my mother didn't slap me because I was so angry with this teacher that if my mother had slapped me, she would have seen a reaction from me that she had never seen before.  You don't slap me for some Caucasian lying on me after I'm threatening to kill him for lying.  All the whippings that I got, never from mischief making, from lying after I got caught mischief making (laughter).  So my mother was wearing my backside out over lies.  And here's a grown person gonna lie on me.  Well no, I wasn't gonna take that.  But my mother did not react.  So I--on the way home from school, she said, "Son, you know, I believe you are telling the truth."  I was so relieved because my mother was the type of mother, she would bring me up in front of the class and whip me in front of all the students if I was out of line.  And she threatened to do that to me, but for me to threaten a teacher, she knew that man was lying.  So that's the base of this man that you know today as Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  I hated white supremacy.  I hate it now.  I hated America for what America was doing to black people.  I was angry with the church because the church was not addressing the pain and hurt of our people.  So I'm always looking for a deliverer.
Story_ID: 633817
Speaker 1: So when I was eleven years old, I went to New York [New York] in the summer to spend a little time with my uncle [Samuel Manning (ph.)].  Now, as black as my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] was in terms of blackness, on her mantelpiece was King George [George VI] and Queen Elizabeth [Elizabeth Bowes Lyon] and a white Jesus.  Well, in all the churches Jesus was white, but for her, there were no black people on our mantelpiece, just King George, I think, and Queen Elizabeth was his wife.  Man, when I got to my uncle's house, I see a black man on the mantelpiece, up above it.  I said, "Who is that?"  He said, "That's a man that came to unite black people."  I was a little shorty, so my uncle got me a chair.  I wanted to get up in the chair so I could study his face and his features.  And when I looked in that man's face, I asked my uncle, "Where is he that I may go and meet him?"  And my uncle said, "He's, he's dead."  And the tears fell from my eyes because it seemed as though I had gotten so close to the person I was longing for, and he was gone.  And that was Marcus Garvey.  So my search was still going on. I'm growing up, I'm playing my violin in the Civic Symphony [Boston Civic Symphony] in Boston [Massachusetts].  And I'm in high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts] with the symphony, all public school symphony.  And when I was twelve years old, I was playing with the Boston College orchestra and traveling with the Boston College orchestra and glee club.  In those days, BC, as it was called, Boston College [Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts], it was an all-male school, not today.  And there was a man called Father Callahan [ph.].  He liked me, and he liked my playing, and so he allowed me to travel with the Boston College glee club and orchestra.  And I was somewhere in Connecticut, I can't remember exactly where, but after you sing, you know, they have a dinner and a party where they pair the glee club members with a girl from the school.  Well, I'm thirteen, I ain't looking for no girl, and then they paired me with a Caucasian girl.  And I was completely out of place.  But I managed to (laughter) get through that night, but I wanted to get out of there fast as I could.  And I (laughter), you might think that this fellow is horrible, if this is the way I grew up.  But my mother reared my brother [Alvan Walcott] always put it in me, "As long as you live, boy, don't you ever bring a white woman in this house talking about you in love and you're gonna marry her."  And she drilled that into me.  And she literally said, "I'll kill you if you do that."  So even though I went to a music school, and it was a pretty little white girl there, that I really liked--I couldn't bring her home to my mother.  So that was the end of that.  But my point is, the environment that I grew up in, West Indian people are fighters because when you come up out of the West Indies, they have black prime ministers, the governor general may be white, but you got black police officer, black judge, black--so everything they see is black.  When they come to America, everything they see is white.  So Mr. Garvey, when he saw that, he said, he didn't see any of us in those kinds of positions, so he wanted to make that happen.
Story_ID: 633818
Speaker 1: Really a split existence in a lot of respects.
Speaker 2: What do you mean?
Speaker 1: Well, you're speaking to a split existence because you're growing up in a, in a white world.  You're playing even classical music.  You're excelling at that.  You meet your--you even talk at the age eleven, about your uncle--what was your uncle's name, by the way?
Speaker 2: Samuel Manning [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay. And when you saw--so I mean but this is the split existence that most black people have anyway.  So I'm saying--you're just speaking to it.  That's all, I was just making a comment. Now (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, growing up in a white world, but I'm growing up in the black part of a white world.  So I'm in school, under white teachers.  I'm in music school under white teachers, but I'm living a black life, suffering the pangs of being black in a white world and hating it, see.  See, the difference with me and others, they'll take it and be quiet about it.  Not I.  I was born to do what I'm doing today.  This, you don't--a man like this is fashioned by circumstances and time, you know.  Other black people can look at me and say, "Oh god, you know, he's rough on folk with his mouth, you know."  They may feel the same way, but they don't have the courage to say what I say.  See, and a people enslaved can't be free with leaders afraid to address the needs and hurts of a people speaking truth to power and willing to give your life to see your people free.  Hell, these are the made people that white folk put in front of us as leaders.  They're not really our leaders.
Speaker 1: But back when you were eleven--
Speaker 2: Take me back there, then.
Speaker 1: Okay, back when you were eleven, Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], those are the years that you're just really trying to find yourself, you know, as a young person.  So that's why I wanted to take you back there to understand--
Speaker 2: That's okay.
Speaker 1: --what, you know, what was really going on in your head?  Now obviously, you have, you're very bright, and now, were you the best, like were you a better student than your brother, Alvan [Alvan Walcott]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] is cultivating that, right?
Speaker 2: In, in one sense, she's cultivating both of us, but she recognizes the quality in one son that she's cultivating, but she's cultivating the qualities that were in my brother.  He was genius in terms of what he could do with his hands and at the piano, he was a master.  So both of us, I would never say that my mother favored me over my brother.  In fact, I thought the opposite, you know, because when you're light skinned and you have a dark skinned mother and a dark skinned brother, you would have the tendency to think that she favored him because he looked more like her.  And he, unfortunately, would have the tendency to think that she favored me because I was light, and in our world, the white world, if you're light skinned and they can see their blood in you, then you get better treatment.  The door opens faster for you.  So the blacker you are in this white world, the more hell you catch, huh?  That's why I'm a warrior against this world, yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, were you ever called yellow because of your light skin?  No?
Speaker 2: If they did, I didn't hear it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they would mock me as a West Indian, "Ah, you people, like monkeys climbing in trees."  This is my black American brothers talking to me like that.  I'd say, "Yeah, I climb 'em, but I'll be damned if I swing from 'em."  You know, that's the kind of young man I was.  I'm just a warrior (laughter), and I love it.
Story_ID: 633819
Speaker 1: Now, when did you, when did you take to the violin?  You said when you started playing at five [years old], you didn't take to it, but then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I took to it around eleven and twelve.
Speaker 1: Um-hm. Now, why is that?
Speaker 2: The reason is this.  You know, when you grow up black in a white world, and you begin to see how you're treated as a black person, but you find you have a gift.  And that gift gives you love and respect and honor among your peers, then you love the thing that gives you what is your human right to have, that as a people, we don't have.  We are ego starved, and that's why black people will become singers and dancers and football players and what not and give their life to something that separates them from a non-existence.  See, and we don't care for the money.  It's the fame.  People love me, people care for me, see.  That's the sickness of what happens under the white supremacy.  It produces in its wake, black inferiority.  And so when I found out that I could play the violin and my friends in school admired me and my teachers admired me--and I never will forget this, sister.  When I was in the sixth grade [at the Sherwin School, Boston, Massachusetts], my teacher asked me, "Louis [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], what would you like to be when you grow up?"  I said, "You know, I would like to be a doctor."  She said, "Oh, Louis," she said, "if you became a doctor, my people would never come to you for treatment, and your own people would not trust your ability, but you play the violin beautifully."  Now, this is happening to me in Boston, Massachusetts.  You go read the autobiography of Brother Malcolm ['The Autobiography of Malcolm X,' Malcolm X and Alex Haley].  He's growing up in Lansing, Michigan, and he's in the eighth grade.  And his teacher asks him, "Malcolm [Malcolm X], what would you like to be when you grow up?"  He said, "I wanna be a lawyer."  And the same thing that my teacher said to me in the sixth grade, his white teacher said to him in the eighth grade.  That's not an accident.  That's a conspiracy to keep young, black men from ever being in any discipline that could threaten white supremacy.  "Oh, you could make a great carpenter, Malcolm.  Farrakhan, you can play the violin."  Violin doesn't threaten white supremacy.  Being a carpenter doesn't threaten white supremacy, but if you learn medical science and become a lawyer and master the law, then you can use the law like Thurgood Marshall and others did to overturn unjust laws that rule us as a people.  So this, this kind of thing, my dear sister, has destroyed young, black men.  And if you go back to your childhood, see, the people that had that the highest IQs in your class that were black boy, where are they today?  Nah, they're in jail, they're dead, they're on drugs.  But the mediocre ones that wouldn't give nobody any trouble, you know, they were nice, they got along.  These are the people that are in leadership positions today.  But the cream of the black crop has been wiped out.  That's not an accident.  That's a conspiracy.  And that conspiracy exists to this very moment that we're having this interview.
Story_ID: 633820
Speaker 1: You have this talent for violin.  You're a good student.  You have the experience at Boston, you come back, you know, Boston Latin [Boston Latin School, Boston, Massachusetts], and I wanna know, who--do you have mentors?  Do you have people in the neighborhood [Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts] you're looking up to?
Speaker 2: No, no.  God has always been my mentor.  I have people that liked me and said kind words to me which I reflect on today with admiration and thought.
Speaker 1: Any teachers that are influencing--
Speaker 2: None.
Speaker 1: No, none of the teachers--
Speaker 2: Not one.
Speaker 1: Oh, no, that's right.
Speaker 2: Not one.  Not one. Not one. When--and I'm not just saying this to be saying it, you know.  All my high school teachers were Caucasian.
Speaker 1: And this is an English, it was an English High School [Boston, Massachusetts] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) English High School.  And why would they wanna encourage me to be a great man for my people.  That's not in their interests.  So I can't remember one teacher that I could say shared the right kind of knowledge with me to encourage me on my path.
Speaker 1: So was English High School, was it--it wasn't--it was mixed, right? Was it?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Story_ID: 633821
Speaker 1: But you were a good student there, and you were good--when did you start running track?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was running track in the seventh and eighth grade, and I started, when I went to high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts] I was running track all my years there.  I had an excellent education.  That education is missing today.  And it's not missing because it's missing.  It's missing because somebody took it out of the public schools.  Now, imagine this, I'm in high school.  I have three years of Latin, two years of French and Spanish and one year of German in high school.  I have algebra.  I have plain geometry, solid geometry, trigonometry and calculus in high school.  I have biology.  I have chemistry, I have physics in high school.  I have ancient history, medieval history, some modern history, in high school.  I graduated, I was sixteen in my senior year of high school.  I turned seventeen in May, graduated in June, and the people that offered me a scholarship to run track at Winston-Salem State--Teachers College in North Carolina [Winston Salem Teachers College; Winston Salem State University, Winston Salem, North Carolina], they wanted me to season one more year athletically, not here.  So I went to a prep school after that kind of high school education.  And when I got to college sister, I never bought a book because everything they were teaching, I already knew.  Now, that's the quality of education that I got in Boston, Massachusetts.  I go south and when--in those days, it was segregation.  When I go south, "You mean to tell me this is gonna be a teachers college?"  When you come out of there, you are a teacher in a black environment.  But you are coming out with an inferior education, and then when I saw the male teachers having sex with the female students, giving them good grades, now this I railed against in college because I can't see, as a black conscious person, and teaching is what you're gonna do to raise our people up, that you would dare have sex with a black girl and give her a good grade to send her out to teach, what? Screwology?  Is this the kind of person you wanna put over black children?  See I had a problem with education in the black schools [HBCUs].  If that's the quality of it, and the moral character of those of us who are entrusted with the responsibility of shaping life, huh?  So I was a Lamp [Lampados Pledge Club], and I pledged, you know, to be Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], but one of the graduate chapter people in Omega dropped a blackball on me after I had gone through one week of secret pro [secret probation], and they're beating the hell out of me to see if I'm the type of material.  And then when it's time to go on open pro, somebody dropped a blackball.  Well, why do you drop a blackball on this black boy because he's talking truth to some corruption that he saw where he was?  See, I'm not just new at this.  This is my life.
Speaker 1: See, I wanna come back to that, but I wanna take you back a little earlier.  I'm gonna ask about that experience.  I'll hold that.  But I wanna take you back because I'm still trying to understand even the high school.
Story_ID: 633822
Speaker 1: So you're playing and you have a lot of, you have a lot of talent, and you appear on the Ted Mack show ['The Original Amateur Hour'].  And I just saw, I just saw a clip of that.  It's on the Internet, of you playing, you know, you introducing yourself.  So that must have been a big deal, though, back then, right?
Speaker 2: A big deal (laughter).  But even then, you know, when you see me on the Ted Mack show, I won in Boston [Massachusetts].  And now I go to New York [New York].  I think it's in 1948--
Speaker 1: I think it was '49 [1949].
Speaker 2: Forty-nine [1949].  And I'm on the Ted Mack show, and when they ask me what would I like to do with my violin, and I say, 'cause Jascha Heifetz was my great inspiration then and now, and I said, "I want to be able to play like Jascha Heifetz."  Well, for a little black boy to wanna play like a man that plays the violin like no other in this modern time, that's a little bit too high for a black boy to aspire.  So they changed my words and write you a script, "I hope that one day I'll break some records on this." And they say, "Oh, you're a record breaker, you're so and so running track," and then I pat my violin and say, "Well, I hope one day I'll break records in this."  That wasn't what I said.
Speaker 1: That's exactly what you--that's right.  That's what you said on air, but you're saying it was written for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, see, so for me, sister, you know, I've been growing up with the, the thoughts of greatness aspiring to do great things, but always somebody there trying to lower my own personal expectations because a black boy shouldn't be aspiring to something like this.  And if I allowed their seed planting to destroy my mind like it's done to so many others, I wouldn't be where I am today.  And so, you know, I had white friends.  I wasn't a racist in that sense.  We were on the track team together.  We cheered for each other.  They came to my house.  I went to their homes.  We got along well.  So when I became this so called great, wicked, anti-Semite, anti-white person, these people from television went back to Boston, went to my high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts], went to my grammar school, went to my teachers, went to my church [St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church, Boston, Massachusetts].  And they couldn't find nobody to say anything negative about me.  They--so, yes, I'm conflicted in a sense, growing up black in a white world.  But I'm decent that I would not harm you or do evil things to you, but I will fight for what I believe is right and good, not only for me, I'm just an instrument.  But for me, when I took you back to being four years old, crying across the street from a funeral parlor [J.B. Johnson Funeral Home, Boston, Massachusetts], see, that's the Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] you're looking today, crying over the pain and hurt of my people.  And I can't ever compromise our future to be loved or wanted.  To hell with that, you know, to be the darling of white people.  So I have to play the game and act like I'm happy over what's happening in America.  No.
Speaker 1: Minister Farrakhan, we're gonna get there.
Speaker 2: I hope so.
Speaker 1: Okay, (laughter) we're gonna get there.
Speaker 2: What's my name (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, we're (laughter) not going there, okay (laughter).
Story_ID: 633823
Speaker 1: Just one other question about high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 2: You can take your time and ask me whatever (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, but what were the things that you liked?  You liked music?  You were good at music.  You liked track.  What other things because, you don't really (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I loved the discipline of military drill.  Growing up in Boston [Massachusetts] in high school, we all had to take military drill.  So they put a rifle in your hand and you learned how all the positions of handling in a rifle.  You were in a squad, in a company, under a captain, a sergeant, a corporal.  And we would drill up and down the floor, and once a year, there was the school board parade where all the boys schools in the City of Boston would come out and drill through the streets of Boston.  I loved that.  Discipline was what made Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]--as a child, any time you'll practice four and five hours a day on your violin, do your homework, run, and I was an excellent athlete.  And I never sloughed off with practice because I know that in order to be great at anything, there's a sacrifice that one has to make.  So all through my life, you know, I've made sacrifices to achieve whatever goal God blessed me to achieve.  So I know that in spite of odds, we, as a people, can achieve with the right mental attitude.
Story_ID: 633824
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] ever tell you also, you and your brother [Alvan Walcott], that being West Indian was different, you know, that maybe you were, you know, in some West Indian households, you know, either different or better or, you know, held to a higher standard or?  I mean was there any of that?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, West Indian people coming to America, there's always somebody to put you down.  And when I was growing up in Boston [Massachusetts], there was a little brother that came up from Atlanta, Georgia.  And the northern black brother wanted to put the southern black brother down.  That's the way we were trained, we grew up.  So as a West Indian and a minority, we had to fend for ourselves against, not only the Caucasian negative attitude towards us, but our own black brothers and sisters had a negative spirit toward West Indian people.  But West Indian people, when they came to America, they began to achieve.  They owned property.  Like the brothers and sisters in the South, when they came north, the northern black person sitting around looking for a job, the southern black brother and sister creating a job.  So the South and West Indies, when you grow up in the North, you're catching it from your own people.  So you have to find some insulation against the prejudice of your own brothers and sisters as well as the, the bias and prejudice of the larger society.  So my mother never taught me against my black brothers and sisters in America, no.  If she had done that, why would I be such a voice for the suffering of black people?  She was much bigger than that, but she always made me to know, in words like this, she said, "Son, when you're wrong, you can't be strong, but when you're right, you can always fight; that when your compass is on righteousness, the power of my being is based on trying to be right."  Treating people like you wanna be treated.  White people come in this house.  We get along beautiful.  Jewish rabbis come in here.  We sit at a common table.  I've never disrespected them, but don't expect me to bow down to foolishness or falsehood.  No.  If I catch you trying to lie to me or play a game with me, I'll bust you down right away.  I don't care who you are.  That, to me, is the way black people need to be in our relationships with white people.  You need to stop faking how you really feel because when they know how you really feel, either they got a choice, I'm gonna treat you with respect or I'll put you out of here.  So either way, you're a winner 'cause if they put you out, you'll do something for yourself.  Excuse me, I--now, this is, this is a good little history, history of Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], yeah.
Story_ID: 633825
Speaker 1: What you're thinking, you know, what your friends were doing, you know-
Speaker 2: Go ahead.
Speaker 1: --I'm just--who your friends were.  That's what I'm trying to understand.  We can get, we can get to your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) My friends were the neighborhood people that I grew up with [in Roxbury, Boston, Massachusetts].  My friends were some from the church [St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church, Boston, Massachusetts] that I grew up with.  My life with my friends was, again, measured because my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] never allowed a sleepover.  We had a very disciplined home environment, and at a certain point, you know, when you go to school, you have track practice, you come home, you have violin practice, you have homework.  You have very little time for the social activities that other young men would get into.  But as a youngster, I loved to dance.  And I was the dancer among my friends, and I had young ladies that were my dancing partners.  And there were social activities, but they were so different than today.  And my mother was very watchful over my brother [Alvan Walcott] and me, but my brother was getting much more loose than I.  But things that attracted my brother, I didn't have an attraction to.
Story_ID: 633826
Speaker 1: As a young man going into the nightclubs, now I can talk about the, the amateur shows that I was on.  This is how I would make little monies--
Speaker 2: So let's talk about that.
Speaker 1: You know, I can't remember the man's name, but in theaters on a Wednesday night, there was like an amateur show.  And he would book me into these amateur shows most of the time.
Speaker 2: Now, this is starting at what age?  Were you sixteen when you started doing that?
Speaker 1: I was--no.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and I would be in these amateur shows.  And some nights you win.  You'd get five dollars.  Some nights you win, you'd get three dollars, and if it's a bigger competition, you might get ten dollars.  And so my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan], you know, whenever I would win, I would bring my money home. And sometimes I would tell her, I only got three dollars, but I really got five dollars, so I would keep (laughter) two dollars for myself.  And mom would always put my money away.  And so all during this period--this was with my violin.  But then when I reached sixteen, and I started singing in the nightclubs, my calypso routine--I would sing ballads and calypso.  And in the nightclub, people would be lined up all around the block to get in to see this young phenom.  And I was exceedingly popular.  And at one, another point, I had my own band and played in different nightclubs and dances and what not.
Speaker 2: Now, did you have your own band when you still in high school [English High School, Boston, Massachusetts]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.
Speaker 2: You formed that at what age?
Speaker 1: Sixteen.
Speaker 2: What was the--
Speaker 1: Sixteen and seventeen.
Speaker 2: Okay, what was the name of your band?
Speaker 1: Well, let me put it like this.  I was playing in the nightclub in Canada.  I was seventeen in Montreal [Canada].  And calypsonians, like rappers, you find a name that kind of suits you, you know.  And I was in this nightclub in Montreal called Rockhead's Paradise.  And a white lady came in, and she liked me.  So I'm sitting down with her, and she's telling me how charming I am.  So from that, I said, I think I'll take the name The Charmer.  So (laughter) when I came back to Boston [Massachusetts], we formed this group, The Charmer and His Calypso Rhythm Boys.  And they were my friends.  And one of the things that disturbed me a lot as a youngster, once I started getting very popular, I noticed envy in some of those around me.  And no matter what I won or what monies that I had, I always wanted to share it with my friends.  But I noticed, the more successful I became, envy built up in some.
Story_ID: 633827
Speaker 1: There was a young woman, not--I mean much older than I, but she would frequent the nightclub.  I don't know whether she was a prostitute or not, but she would hang out with the sailors who would come to Boston [Massachusetts] on furlough.  And we had a friendship.  And when I went to her home one day, and I talked to her about the envy that I was experiencing from some of my friends, and she said to me, "Well," she said, "they envied Jesus."  And, "If he could not escape it, how can you?"  Those words from that woman had a profound effect on me because when you achieve in this world, you run into envy.  You run into petty things that people will do to try to hurt whatever it is that you want to do or you desire to do or say things about you that will hurt you and hurt you with others.  So I'm learning now as I'm growing more and more this sick disease that's in the hearts of a lot of our people because all our people want to do great things.  And all our people have greatness within them, and they may not have the opportunity to demonstrate it.  So when one from among us demonstrates what really is in all of us, those that have not yet found themselves or their purpose in life could become envious of that person and then say ugly, ugly things about them, and whether they know it to be true or not.  And that's why, you know, most people that are famous, you always hear garbage.  And I ask people, you know, like as a dancer, and I mean I could really dance.  And the women and the men would come and they would fall, really in love with me.  So some would say, "Ah, man, you know, he's, he's gay."  They used the term gay back then or, "He's queer," you know.  Now, why would you say something like that about somebody that you don't even know or you try to poison people 'cause your girlfriend likes The Charmer (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now, what was your favorite song back then that you sang?
Speaker 1: I, boy, if I got into that now.  You know, in calypso, the double entendre meanings.  You have one meaning on the surface that's quite nice, but under it is a vulgar meaning.  So that's what the people liked to hear, and the Minister [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] was very good at it (laughter).
Speaker 2: So give me some examples (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no.
Speaker 2: You can't?  Okay, that day is gone, huh?  We can't give--
Speaker 1: I'm not going there, that's gone.
Speaker 2: Okay, that day is gone, okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).
Speaker 2: That's too bad.  So, okay.  But some of your songs were like, that you were like, that you sang, 'Back to Back' ['Back to Back, Belly to Belly'], 'Stone Cold Man,' right?  I mean your group [The Charmer and His Calypso Rhythm Boys].  You even came up with your, you had a CD [compact disc] you published, the 'Ugly Woman,' the 'Female Boxer,' 'Zombie Jamboree.'
Speaker 1: Yeah, and some of those, the double entendre side of it was very vulgar.  But, yes, those are songs that are out there now.  I didn't put 'em out there.  But because I did them, they're out there, and my grandchildren found, found, found them on the Internet and told me, "Grandpa, you--." I didn't know you sang 'Don't Touch My Nylons' [sic. 'Don't Touch Me Nylon'], something (laughter).  Anyway, but it's my life, and it's part of my life, and I'm not ashamed of it in the sense that I won't go back to it.  But it's how I grew.
Story_ID: 633828
Speaker 1: But also calypso was very popular back then at the time that you were, I mean it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It was popular among West Indian people, but not until [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte really popularized calypso because he was such a great, great artist and folk singer.  He was one of my idols when I was young.  When he was playing, I think the show on Broadway was called 'Almanac' ['John Murray Anderson's Almanac,' Richard Adler and Jerry Ross].
Speaker 1: Oh, okay. But this is around this period though that we're talking about, the '50s [1950s], right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was on Broadway, and they took him off of that Broadway show to go and do a movie with Dorothy Dandridge.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was brought in from Boston [Massachusetts] to audition for his role.  And I didn't make it, for what reason I don't know.  But another calypsonian was put in his place.  And, of course, they allowed me to come back stage to meet Harry that night that I auditioned.  And it's interesting that Harry--I'm dong an album now, and it's the journey of my life in music.  And I asked Harry to be a part of it, and he said he would, but we haven't finalized that yet.  But he is the man that really made calypso jump across just the West Indian community into the broader American community.
Story_ID: 633829
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't wanna go back and forth, but I need to finish up Winston Salem [Winston Salem Teachers College; Winston Salem State University, Winston Salem, North Carolina] before we come.  So you're, you're, you're singing, but then you also go to school.  Now, how did you end up choosing or how did that happen that, you know, you went towards Winston Salem?
Speaker 2: Some of my track buddies [at the English High School, Boston, Massachusetts] that were in classes, older than I, got scholarships to Winston Salem.  So, naturally, they recommended me and the coach came up and saw me run and gave me a scholarship.  So that--I didn't care about being a teacher.  I--my life was music, but my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] wanted me to have something to fall back on in case the music thing didn't work out.  So I went on to college.  And I wanna say this about my school.  It's one of the greatest experiences of my life.  I talked about something negative.  But now, let me talk about the positives because I'm in a black environment [HBCU].
Speaker 1: And this is your first--this is black environment, but you're also in a southern environment.
Speaker 2: And this I deliberately told my mother that I wanted to go south because I wanted to feel what our people had been feeling all their lives.  So my first big run in was on my way to college.  I had an eight hour layover in Washington, D.C.  And I came out of the Union Station [Washington, D.C.].  And I said, well, let me go to a movie.  And I went down the street.  There was this movie theater.  And my mom had given me a twenty dollar bill, which was big.  And as I was getting close to the, to the booth to buy the ticket, I noticed people looking at me real strange.  And I thought that my pants was unbuttoned or something, and I checked myself out.  I had no idea that it was my color.  And when I got to put my twenty dollar bill up to get my ticket, a white usher in a uniform came and said, "We don't sell tickets to Negroes."  And a friend of mine that graduated with me had gone into the armed services and got killed in Korea.  And I'm in America and couldn't go to a movie.  Man, I walked away from that theater with the twenty dollar bill in one hand, the little wallet in the other, and when I got on that train going south, I wrote a song, calypso, 'Why America Is No Democracy' because if democracy means something good, America is the very opposite of what she preaches.  And when I got to Winston Salem, I had the song done.  And on freshman talent night, I found me two brothers from the South who would like accompany me, playing the maracas and some other instrument.  And I sang 'Why America Is No Democracy.'  And that was my introduction on that campus.  Well, how is--and what kind of man is this?  He comes down here from Boston [Massachusetts].  Now he's gonna talk about America in this kind of disparaging way, you know.  Well, if you live under that, you've gotten used to it.  I didn't live under that.  I wasn't used to it, and when somebody told me that I couldn't buy a ticket when my buddy was dead in Korea, fighting for this?  So that's my college.
Story_ID: 633830
Speaker 1: I loved the spirit of the South.  I could go off the campus [of Winston Salem Teachers College; Winston Salem State University, Winston Salem, North Carolina] and the neighbors, they knew I was a stranger.  They'd invite me in their home, and every Friday night, the fights would come on.  And I would go into the homes.  It was an environment that just deepened my love for black people and my commitment, the South.  And I won the Horace Heidt show in North Carolina.  And Horace Heidt came, they wouldn't let no black people perform, audition.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] rose up and fought it, and Horace Heidt opened a competition for black children.  Me and another black girl tied for first place.  And I was taken to do the national Horace Heidt show.  And it was my first flight from Winston Salem [North Carolina] to Raleigh, North Carolina to appear, and it was nationally--radio, national radio.  And, but if it were not for the NAACP, I wouldn't have gotten that opportunity.  And that's why to me the NAACP is a very special group.  They were a part of my formation, through The Crisis magazine, and reading of their struggles was inspiration to me.  And I would never have been on the Horace Heidt Show if it were not for the strength of the members of the NAACP in Winston Salem.
Story_ID: 633831
Speaker 1: Now, what didn't you like about the, the, the school [Winston Salem Teachers College; Winston Salem State University, Winston Salem, North Carolina] though?  You talked about your--
Speaker 2: That was the negative.
Speaker 1: The negative.
Speaker 2: The, and the other negative (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, but you were talking about the negative as it relates to the pledge experience? Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, that's, that's a negative, but, you know, it was negative because--
Speaker 1: But can you explain that a little bit more, about the blackball?  I mean that went over my head, in a sense.
Speaker 2: Well, in this sense, once you're blackballed--
Speaker 1: Oh, blackball--oh, you were blackballed?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, why were you blackballed?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I don't really know, but I imagine it's because of me.  It's because of my attitude.  It's because of the things that I was saying on the campus about teachers having sex with students, giving them good grades.  And some of them were Omegas [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  "So this upstart, I don't want him in our fraternity."  So they blackballed me, okay.  But, you know, it's the way--
Speaker 1: So, you never got to pledge even though you wanted to?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I pledged.
Speaker 1: You pledged?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a Lamp [Lampados Pledge Club].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's the pledge group.  Now, you go to become Omega.  Well, then you have what they called two weeks of, of probation.  One is secret pro where the campus doesn't see you.  You're--but you go through whatever they put you through for seven days in secret.  Then you come out in the open, and they harass you, humiliate you and do all of that.  Well, I made up my mind I wanted to be an Omega, so I wanted to accept that, you know.  But after they whooped me for those seven days with that paddle and then told me, "I'm sorry, you were blackballed," and so I never got on open pro.  And when--after I became the Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], and they realized that I was a Lamp and wanted to become an Omega, one of basileus, one of the leaders, he brought me my Omega pin.  And I accepted it graciously, you know.  But, you know, suffering for standing up for truth is what my life is about, you know.
Story_ID: 633832
Speaker 1: So did you find some things backwards about the South in that way or about the school [Winston Salem Teachers College; Winston Salem State University, Winston Salem, North Carolina], that were different from the North?
Speaker 2: Backward in the sense that the education was inferior.  And if your education is inferior, then you can never get to equality in a society when your education is less than the education of those in the dominant society.  So that's the negative of segregated education.  The positive is that we were with our own people.  We learned to love each other.  We learned to depend on each other.  We learned to buy from each other.  And so in the South, we had businesses because we were forced to do business for self and we had insurance companies, bus companies, motels, hotels.  But the moment that America saw the purchasing power of black people, then integration was a necessary tool, not to make us equal, but to take away from us that purchasing power that has grown to this day to three quarters of a trillion dollars a year.  That kind of purchasing power, businesspeople cannot ignore.  So integration was not to make us socially equal as much as it was to get a way into the black consumer dollar.
Story_ID: 633833
Speaker 1: So when you, Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], when you--you went there [Winston Salem Teachers College; Winston Salem State University, Winston Salem, North Carolina] two years, right?
Speaker 2: Three.
Speaker 1: Three years (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Finished, three years.
Speaker 1: You finished in three years, okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't finish in three years.  It was a four year course, so I never graduated.  I was with my dear wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan], and she became pregnant with my first child.  And she wanted me to stay in college.  I only had one more year to go, but I could not abide my wife being pregnant with my child, and I'm sitting up in a classroom when I should be out making some money to feed my wife and my new little baby.  So I decided I would not come back to college for my fourth year and graduate with my class.  I was out trying to become a good husband and a good father.
Speaker 1: And that's a beautiful picture of the two of you up there on your wedding day.
Speaker 2: And that wedding gown that my wife has on was made by my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan].
Speaker 1: Hm.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: You said she was a good seamstress.  Now, do you remember that day, your wedding day?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: Can you describe it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a, I guess a strange day.  I'm going out on life's road when my wife, my girlfriend then was pregnant, and I told my mother.  She said, "Well, how do you know that this child is yours?"  And I said, "Well, I know it's mine."  She said, "But how do you know?"  I said, "I know."  And she said, "Well, I'm not gonna sign for you to marry" cause I was underage.  I was twenty and the age was twenty-one.  So I said, "It doesn't make any difference.  I'll go to another state where I don't need your signature, but my child is not gonna come into this world without my name."  So I was adamant, you know, that I was gonna marry her.  So when my mother found out that I was serious, well, you know, before that she said, "I wanted to have a nice wedding for you under different circumstances."  I said, "I don't need a bunch of hypocrites at my wedding.  I only need her and me and God.  That's sufficient for me," you know.  And so my mother relented and signed, and then helped to give us a beautiful send off, you know.  I've always--when I found trouble, my refuge has always been God.  And I believed that I was doing the right thing by marrying her, and evidently, it was right 'cause fifty-seven years later, we're still together.  She's given me nine beautiful children, I think about forty grandchildren, and forty-two great-grandchildren.  So, I mean, a lot has come from those two people in that picture, and character, you know.  I loved her because she didn't love me for what I was.  She loved me for who I was, not who in the sense of he's The Charmer, but who she found in me, somebody worthy to love.  And I liked her as the opposite of me, to balance me. And as a child, I'm sixteen.  Now, when she and I started going together, I was seventeen, and she was fourteen.  And I used to tell some of my friends, you know, "When you have a lot of women, you think you're popular, but the women that love you most are the women that can't have you."  I said, "You would be wise to have one girl, and when you finish, come off that stage, you come to her and let the rest of 'em cheer, but never get close to you."  And that's the way I lived my life in those days.
Story_ID: 633834
Speaker 1: And you could go to Boston [Massachusetts], and you could talk to people from one end of the city to another.  They will tell you, "He's a very honorable and moral brother."  I can't tell you I'm a saint, that I didn't do things that were not right because I did, but I profited from every mistake that I made.  And that woman [Farrakhan's wife, Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan] in that picture, she kept me.  My love for her, kept me on a path.  And, and I can tell you, you know, it's a lot of temptation out there when you're in this kind of business.  But I never once fell for the temptation because when you really love, you can live a good, moral, clean life.  And that, that I was doing before I met Islam and the teaching of Elijah Muhammad.  It was me and her.  And I don't care where I went, man, I, I've played in nightclubs, well, we were married then.  This Caucasian woman, she wanted--I used to wear these cummerbunds and some big Cuban kind of clothes, you know, for my routines.  And this woman promised she was gonna make an entire uniform of twenty dollar bills, pants and shirt and what not.  And I nicely turned her down--I'll come back to her.  And when I was in Canada, a young lady was a prostitute, and she came to my hotel--I mean not a hotel, it was a rooming house, and rang the bell.  And when I went down the stairs, she had a fist full of money that she had made prostituting.  And she put that money in my hand, and I gave it back to her and told her, "No, sweetheart, you work very hard for your money."  And whatever my salary was, I was satisfied with that.  And this woman that was gonna make me this garment of twenty dollar bills, she said, "I think you're a faggot."  I said, "Well, I know who I am, but you'll never find out."  I mean for me, sister, I love the way God has helped to shape my life.  I can't tell you that I haven't made mistakes 'cause that would be a lie.  I can't tell you that I have not sinned.  That would be a lie, but I can tell you this, that God has helped me to overcome weakness, you know.  You'll hear me in some of my lectures, I tell the people, I didn't fall down from heaven.  I came up from hell.  I was smoking reefers, and ganjah at sixteen, but I didn't like that.  I got drunk one or two times in my life, but I didn't like that.  I never wanted to be out of control.  So none of that had no pull on me, none, yeah.
Story_ID: 633835
Speaker 1: Nineteen fifty-five [1955] when you're performing, you're headlining a show, 'Calypso Follies,' I think it's Blue Angel, you know, here in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: (Nods head) Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And you have a friend of yours, Rodney Smith, who's with you.
Speaker 2: No, he's not with me.
Speaker 1: He's not with you, I'm sorry.  He's not with you.
Speaker 2: He's here for the Saviours' Day convention of the Nation of Islam.  And my wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan] and I are in a taxi, and we're going some place, and I happen to see him.  So we stopped the taxi.  We get out, and Rodney says, "Your [maternal] uncle [Samuel Manning (ph.)] is right around the corner."  And I went around the corner, and it was a little, a bakery and convenience store owned by the Muslims on Wentworth Avenue here in Chicago.  And some of my friends from Boston [Massachusetts] said, "Well, you're in town."  I wanted him to come and see my show at the Blue Angel, but he wasn't interested in that.  So he asked me if I would come to hear Elijah Muhammad, and I had heard of him.  But I said, "Sure, I would love to hear him."  So arrangements were made.  I was living at that time at 49th [Street] and Drexel [Boulevard] at the Wilmington Arms Hotel [ph.].  At the Blue Angel, the owner of that, he--I was reading in the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] maybe about two years ago, and I just happened to turn the obituary page, and the owner, Gene Faduli [ph.] was his name, had passed away.  He was a big, Greek man who was a former wrestler.  And again, my militant spirit, you know.  At first when I came, I came in '54 [1954].  And I wasn't headlining the show then.  I was just appearing on the show.  And I was staying on East Huron [Street] at a little motel on East Huron.  And Mayor Daley's father [Richard J. Daley] was, at that time, campaigning to be mayor of the City of Chicago.  So I did so well and was so popular at my first coming to Chicago, that Mr. Faduli wanted me to come back and feature me.  And that's when I was the headliner of the show, 'Calypso Follies.'
Story_ID: 633836
Speaker 1: So I came back in February of 1955 while I was here September '54 [1954].  So, I go to the mosque.  My oldest child, my first child, she was two weeks--one year and two weeks old.  So my wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan] and I, we put her in her little stroller, and we walked around to 5335 S. Greenwood Avenue [Chicago, Illinois].  But I noticed when we went in, they took, separated my wife from me.  I didn't know that that was the custom in the mosque [Temple No. 2, Chicago, Illinois], but they took me and put me up in the balcony where, when you're first timers, you always sit down in the front so you could see and hear.  And the leader or whoever is teaching could see you and how you're responding.  But Malcolm X was told by Rodney Smith that this very popular entertainer from Boston [Massachusetts] was coming to the convention.  So he mentioned me to Elijah Muhammad.  So Elijah Muhammad, the year before, the Saviours' Day before, he said, "I'm expecting or looking for my little helper."  And the next year, '55 [1955], he hears about this young boy.  And so he puts me in the balcony, near a pole, but he put behind me at that pole somebody that he knew so he could look up and see that man and then get a view of this young man.  And so by my being a student of English, and he did not speak English very well, I was critical of him in my mind.  And he looked up at me, and he said, "Oh brother, I didn't get the mighty fine education that you got.  When I got there, the school door was closing, but don't you pay no attention to how I'm saying it.  You pay attention to what I'm saying.  Then you take it and put it in that fine language that you know, only try to understand what I'm saying."  And, of course, I was frightened because he was, in a sense, reading my thoughts.  And I listened to his lecture.  It was called A Savior is Born for the Black Man and Woman of America, and when he finished, he asked for acceptances.  My wife got up and took my baby, but I wasn't quite ready.  So my [maternal] uncle [Samuel Manning (ph.)] came and told me, "Get up, get up."  And I'm never disrespectful to my uncle or elders.  So I got up and went and took my form, and my wife and I went back to our little place at the Wilmington Arms [Wilmington Arms Hotel (ph.)].  And we wrote our letter of acceptance.  I never got an answer.
Story_ID: 633837
Speaker 1: So I came back to New York [New York].  We had a nice little apartment in Long Island [New York].  We started first in the home of Coley Wallace, who was the brother that was a boxer who played the leading role in 'The Joe Louis Story.'  And I was--and my wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan] and my baby, we were in his basement.  And I met a man called Thomas View [ph.], who was managing a friend of mine, Francisco Lopez [ph.], and he wanted to manage me.  But I didn't know he was a Muslim.  So he started talking to me about religion, and he intrigued me.  And at that time, he was living in the basement of Coley Wallace's house.  And I went there, and I tasted bean soup for the first time.  And he talked to me about Fard Muhammad [Wallace Fard Muhammad] and showed me a picture of him.  And when he opened the Holy Qur'an [Koran], and I saw this picture of Fard Muhammad, it was like somebody had hit me in the head.  I started really seeing stars, and I don't know to this day why I instantly believed that that man in that picture was the answer to the coming of God after the black man and woman of America.  But after Elijah Muhammad taught, and I didn't quite--wasn't quite ready to join, but I started going to the mosque [Temple No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York], and I was hearing Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X], and I never heard a black man talk like Malcolm.  Now, if you wanna know who influenced me, and I told you no man, no man, no man, and it's true.  Brother Malcolm was the first and greatest influence of my life up to that time.  And he, I didn't even know that I could speak because I used to stammer and stutter.  And one day Malcolm invited me up to talk on what Islam had done for me.  And when I started to speak, the temple just erupted.  And, of course, Malcolm then saw something in me, put me in the ministry class and began to teach me.  And I became a lieutenant in the mosque and assistant minister and rose up through the ranks.
Speaker 2: Now, that was--is that '57 [1957]? Is this fifty (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 2: Is this, is this--
Speaker 1: That's '55 [1955].
Speaker 2: Fifty-five [1955] that all this happens in '55 [1955] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Started.
Speaker 2: Okay, I know it started in '55 [1955], but--
Speaker 1: It started in '55 [1955].
Story_ID: 633838
Speaker 1: I was in the mosque one month, and a letter came down.  I was playing in a nightclub in Greenwich Village [New York, New York] called the Village Bond [ph.].  So I couldn't get to the mosque that day, but when the matinee was over before the night show began, I came up to Temple No. 7 [Mosque No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York] luncheonette at 120th Street and Lenox Avenue [Malcolm X Boulevard] to get a bowl of bean soup.  And a young man, brother, was there, and he said, "Oh, man, Elijah Muhammad sent a letter today that Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] read.  And everybody that's in show business either gotta get out of show business or get out of the temple."  I heard that.  I got up from the table.  I walked out the door, was right on the corner.  I took a left, and I walked about twenty or thirty paces, maybe.  And I said, "Well, I can live without music, but I can't live without the truth."  I turned right around, went back and sat down at the table.  And I made up my mind right then and there that I was gonna give up my music.  And I had to make that decision between that day in November, and I had the whole of December to make up my mind.  So in December I had a few what we call gigs.  And one of them was in what is called the Borscht circuit up in the mountains [Catskill Mountains] in Upstate New York.  And I was playing at a nightclub, really not a nightclub, but it was a great resort called the Nevele Country Club [Ellenville, New York].  It's eleven spelled backwards.  And being among Jewish people, I always loved chopped liver and those kind of things.  I loved their food.  And there I was.  And I decided, to heck with it.  I'll just get it all out of my system.  So when it was my turn, I sang ballads.  I sang light classics.  I sang the blues.  I played classical violin.  I played violin.  I told jokes.  I danced.  Now, I'm through, getting it all out of my system.  And I go downstairs to change out of my clothes, and a man came downstairs.  And the other day, I couldn't remember his name, and I was reading in a music book, the name Purcell [ph.].  And I said--that was his name.  He came in my dressing room, and he said, "I manage Pearl Bailey and Billy Daniels."  And he said, "If you will come in my stable, under them, I can guarantee you five hundred dollars a week and any supper club that will take Pearl Bailey and Billy Daniels will have to take you.  And we'll work on your craft.  You're a very talented person.  Do you have a manager?"  I said, "No."  So I was to meet him downtown New York [New York] the next day to have dinner with him and his lawyer, and they would get a contract, a management contract, guaranteeing me in '55 [1955], five hundred dollars a week.
Story_ID: 633839
Speaker 1: I went home.  I wasn't even thinking about going to meet that man.  And that night, I had a vision of two doors, and one door had over it, "Success," and I could look in it.  And it was a mound in that door coming up a little higher than this stand of gold and diamonds.  And the other door had over it, "Islam," and a black veil.  I couldn't see nothing on the other side of that door, but I was told to choose in this vision like experience, and, of course, I chose Islam.  And the man never saw me.  I never went to have any dinner with him, and I came on into Islam and gave up show business and took a job selling screen doors and storm doors and storm windows at thirty-five dollars a week.  And I was bad at every job.  I tell you.  I had never worked days, you know.  And I didn't do so well selling.  So my next job, one of the brothers in the mosque [Mosque No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York] got me a job in a restaurant washing dishes, you know.  And there I was (laughter), washing dishes and running coffee up to the various places that would order things.  And that day that man asked me to peel some potatoes, and I had never peeled a potato in my life.  And there was more skin than potato coming off the potatoes (laughter).  And that man said, "Ah, all right, Louis [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], get up.  And take a mop and just mop the floor."  And I don't mop floors.  So I did such a bad job, and then I was so tired after working twelve hours, I overslept the next day.  And I called that man and told him, "Well, I'm so sorry, I overslept.  I'm on my way."  He said, "Don't bother.  Just come in and pick up your last check." (Laughter) And that's been, that was my experience loading trucks, cleaning toilets, whatever the job was.  I really didn't care, you know, but I had college education [from Winston Salem Teachers College; Winston Salem State University, Winston Salem, North Carolina], and people were saying, "You're too educated, you know, you're not suited for this."  But I needed to make some money to feed my family.
Story_ID: 633840
Speaker 1: So I decided, I told Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X], I think I wanna go back to Boston [Massachusetts] and try to help the mosque [Temple No. 11; Muhammad Mosque No. 11] in Boston.  So he gave me his approval.  I went back to Boston and got a job in the garment section of Boston.  And while I was on that job making forty-five dollars a week, I got a telegram from the Golden Slipper nightclub [Golden Slipper Restaurant and Nightclub] in Glen Cove, Long Island [New York] where I used to work, offering me three hundred and fifty dollars a week if I would come back and perform.  So I laughed and turned it down and kept my little forty-five dollars a week job.  And I did this.  And then I became the minister of the mosque, working at sixty-five dollars a week at a place called, oh god, Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier [Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier, Inc.; EG&G], something like that.  And it was making, oh heck, I can't remember, but I had to sandblast these little rings that went into some kind of cameras and what not.  But I hung in there, and the mosque was growing so fast, Elijah Muhammad told me, "You can leave that day job and you can get one hundred dollars a week from the mosque treasury."  Well, I never got a hundred dollars.  But I worked hard, and we, we were the first mosque on the East Coast to own our own building.
Speaker 2: Now, where was the mosque located?
Speaker 1: At that time, they called it a temple then.
Speaker 2: Temple.
Speaker 1: It was at 552, I think, Columbus Avenue in Boston.  It was an old former fish house.  And it got so crowded, the FOI [Fruit of Islam] had to stand on the outside.  And they found a place, a former Jewish, called the Apiarian Plaza [ph.] where they would do bar mitzvahs and what not.  And so they sold it to us, and we renovated it and opened it up.  And we just were growing.
Story_ID: 633841
Speaker 1: But before that, you know, Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] was writing a column in the Amsterdam News [New York Amsterdam News], and he wrote a column one day called A White Man's Heaven is a Black Man's Hell.  So I wrote a calypso ['A White Man's Heaven is a Black Man's Hell'] by that same name.  And December of 1959, I went into RCA Victor Studios in New York [New York] with a band and recorded that song, and it became like an underground movement song.  And I started writing plays and putting my musical talent to work promoting Islam.  And we played Carnegie Hall [New York, New York], Boston Symphony Hall [Symphony Hall, Boston, Massachusetts], Civic--the other place in New York, Town Hall [The Town Hall].  We played a big place in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  We played the Tivoli Theater here in Chicago [Illinois], played at Dunbar High School [Dunbar Vocational High School; Dunbar Vocational Career Academy High School, Chicago, Illinois].  We played in Georgia, and I mean the places were all packed.  And it was, the Minster [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] really, acting, singing, dancing, playing his violin.  So one day, I was playing at the Dunbar High School here in Chicago.  And there were two shows that day.  And the evening show, unknown to me, Elijah Muhammad slipped in and went up in the balcony and sent word to me after the performance that he wanted to see me the next day.  And I had written a song called 'Black Gold' where this beautiful sister would be under a lamppost, and she would be selling herself to whoever would buy her.  And, of course, I came out singing a song called 'Look at My Chains' which another brother [Donald Reid] and I collaborated to write.  And I mean the people in the audience were crying, and I was singing this, 'Look at My Chains,' and when I went to the home of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad the next day, he pulled me real close to him, and he said, "Brother, you're a very, very talented musician."  He said, "But your greatest gift is in the spiritual."  He said, "You know, when you have my people playing the part of a homosexual or a prostitute, even though you have me in the play correcting their behavior," he said, you know, "Brother, when you get a fish out of the water, if you leave it too close to the banks, it will keep flopping around until it flops back in the water.  Getting our people away from this lifestyle, you don't want them playing the part because in order to play the part, they have to think the part.  And pretty soon, you might lose them."  He said, "And you know, brother, the people were just crying while you were singing."
Story_ID: 633842
Speaker 1: And he [Elijah Muhammad] said, "You know, one day Fard Muhammad [Wallace Fard Muhammad] came to the house on a Sunday evening after I had taught at the temple.  And he was at the dinner table, and he asked the people, he said, "How was the meeting today?"  And they said, "Oh, it was great.  There wasn't a dry eye in the temple.  Elijah Muhammad was preaching on the prodigal son, and it was like we were the prodigal son who had gone into a strange land to try to adopt the life of a strange people and squandered all of the wealth that we had in our father's house.  And then we decided one day, I think I will arise and go to my father and, oh, man."  So then he said, Fard Muhammad had a very stern expression on his face.  And he looked at Elijah Muhammad and said, "Brother, I came to wipe away the tears from the eyes of my people.  So don't you make them cry.  They have cried enough."  So he used that little example to tell me, you're making my people cry over a slavery, being in chains, that they've come out of, but it's still painful, but don't keep rehearsing the pain in words.  So he said, "What I want you to promise me you will do, you will give up all of this music entirely and devote yourself totally to the spiritual.  Will you do that, brother?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  And I gave it up, all of it.  And then in '74 [1974], he was in this house.  And he--I don't know how I brought my violin out here, but after dinner, he asked me to come and play for him.  And when I played, he said, "Boy," he said, "you really can play that thing."  (Laughter) And a couple of weeks later, he called me.  He said, "Brother, I want you to come out on Tuesday.  Nobody will be here but Sister Tynnetta [Tynnetta Muhammad] and her children and myself, and I want you to bring your violin with you."  So he had this place here broken down.  All the chairs were set on the side.  And Ishmael [Ishmael R. Muhammad], my assistant minister, he was a little boy then.  And his brother, Rasul [Rasul Muhammad], and they did a skit.  And then Sister Tynnetta, she played the piano, and then he says, "Go and play."  And after I played, he looked at me, he said, "Isn't that the same song you played for me the last time you was here?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  He said, "Well, don't you know anything new?"  Well, what was he saying?  He was putting me back to my music because now the music would do something for me that the word had not done up to that point.  We'll get into that.
Speaker 2: That's, that's a beautiful story right there.  Now--
Story_ID: 633843
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you, what was it--okay there are two, what was the message that you were hearing that, 'cause it was almost like this was--you were willing to give everything up that you knew at that point.  So what were you hearing, you know, and it was Malcolm's [Malcolm X] message to you, I think, at the beginning, right?  What did you hear?  What did Malcolm represent?
Speaker 2: Malcolm represented the strength of a fighter for black people that I was looking for in my pastors, looking for in the men that were in the church, looking for in the world in leadership.  I found it no place.  But when I heard Brother Malcolm, there was the fire.  There was the intelligence.  There was the strength and courage of a man willing to confront white America for the evils that they have done to us.  So the message of Malcolm was a message from Elijah Muhammad that we had fulfilled prophesy.  And he went into the scriptures, and he showed how we had fulfilled prophesy from Genesis all the way to Revelations.  Malcolm was a heck of a teacher.  He was more political than spiritual, but as a teacher, I never found one of Elijah Muhammad's ministers or followers that was his equal.  He was the most disciplined person.  He never was late for an appointment.  And just like when I came downstairs at ten o'clock, I'm sitting in this chair, whatever Brother Malcolm had an appointment, if the appointment was at two o'clock, at five minutes to two, Malcolm would drive up to the restaurant and at thirty seconds to two, he would start walking in that restaurant.  And at two o'clock, he would sit down with his appointment.  Elijah Muhammad hated the fact that we were always late, had no respect for time.  And so our meetings had to start on time, whether one person was in there or nobody was in there.  You start your meeting on time.  And so we would be punished for being late.  And that's the way Malcolm trained us.  He was super disciplined.  And I came up under him, and he was the first man in my life, and I could say without having to doubt my word, up to that time, he was the best man in my life until I came closer to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
Story_ID: 633844
Speaker 1: Tell me what the training was like, you know, for--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --the temple at that time?  What was the training?
Speaker 2:  	Well, first, the training was, you had to be clean, inwardly and outwardly.  When we would come to our class as men, we would have to stand for inspection.  They looked at our nails, couldn't be any dirt under our nails.  Our hair had to be cut, in perfect condition, our suits with a crease in it.  You couldn't have, be in the ranks with no crease in your pants.  Your shoes had to be shined, cleanliness in and out.  Then we had lessons to learn because we all came into the mosque as students.  And to this day, we never get out of life without being a student.  And so we started studying, everyone of us, under Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X].  We all had a briefcase, and in our briefcase was a Bible, a Qur'an [Koran], our lessons, a book called 'Seventeen Million Negroes, Seventeen Billion Dollars' [sic. 'Fifteen Million Negroes and Fifteen Billion Dollars,' William K. Bell]. And another book, '100 Amazing Facts about the Negro' by-
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): J.A. Rogers [Joel Augustus Rogers].
Speaker 2: I'm sorry?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICES):  By J.A. Rogers.
Speaker 2:  	By J.A. Rogers, and 'From "Superman" to Man,' all the books of J.A.  But the main thing was, we had a briefcase.  And we were dressed like this all the time.  He wanted us to dress like the businesspeople that you see going downtown in Chicago [Illinois], downtown New York [New York], downtown Boston [Massachusetts] 'cause he was getting us up out of the thinking that we are just to be the common laborer, the common shoeshine boy, the common garbage man.  But it was nothing wrong with having a decent job, but you must aspire now to create jobs.  So our training was military and disciplined drill.  We were taught--
Speaker 1: Which suited your life because remember you talked (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) Because of my growing up, you know.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2:  	Then we were taught, I mean, the care, the protection of our women.  And, oh, my goodness, we were taught--our wives were in a class [Muslim Girls Training and General Civilization Class].  They were learning how to sew, how to cook, how to keep house, how to take care of your husband, how to rear your children, how to act at home and abroad.  And I mean these women, they would never go in the store and buy garments.  They would go downtown to the fabric places and buy beautiful fabrics, buy a Simmons pattern [ph.], come back, get your sewing machine and put your dress on and dress your children in a decent way.  Elijah Muhammad was making a new people out of us.  So in the black community, our diet was different, so our skin was bright and glowing.  You know, you could come in the Nation overweight, but by eating according to his dietary law, you would begin to trim your weight down.  And we died so seldom, it was like we didn't believe that we died because one man could go throughout the whole Nation of Islam saying funerals for the believers because the way we lived, the diet that we ate, the proper foods that we ate.  We never had health insurance or life insurance.  Our life insurance and our health insurance was how you took care of this temple that we call the human body.
Story_ID: 633845
Speaker 1: So an insatiable desire to learn.  And from those of us who would come in, I was one of the first in the mosque to have a college education.  Most had not even graduated from high school.  So there was a temple reading class, that illiteracy was not tolerated.  Even if you came to the Nation [Nation of Islam] like that, you can't stay non-reading, non-writing, non-learning.  So that culture is what we grew up in, and Malcolm X was our example.  He only went to the eighth grade.  But after he came or while he was in prison, you know, he read the dictionary.  That was his book, and I was with him at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] when he debated a man with a doctorate in law, and he defeated everybody that came against him in argument because Elijah Muhammad's teaching made us think outside of the educational box that white America, not only puts us in, but puts the American white people in so that a small clique, you would call it an aristocracy of families continue to rule the masses whether they're white or Asian or Hispanic or black.  So to think outside that box was to think creatively, and Elijah Muhammad's teaching was that we should pool our resources and go into business for ourselves, and that's what we did.  And so, that was our training, being on time, being clean.  Ooh, I used to cuss like a sailor, and one of the brothers that took me under his wing, when I would cuss, he would say, "Brother Louis [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], you can find a better word to say than that."  And he broke me from cursing.  That was big.  We could never use the word nigger.  That's absolutely unacceptable dialogue even if you're talking to another black person about black people.  You couldn't say, "That nigger," and you could never call a woman out of her name.  You had to honor and respect the female.  So this was his teaching.  And I mean he was producing a brand new people.  And he never allowed us to carry weapons, not even as much as a penknife, but we would fight.  And that's how Malcolm became known.  When you go look at the movie on his life ['Malcolm X'], when they--police beat up one of our brothers, the men just came, went and ringed the police station.  They had to get our brother up out of there, take him to a hospital.  And when Malcolm waved his hand and dispersed the crowd, they left.  And the white police commander said, "That's too much power for any black man to have."  See, so we were growing into a love and respect and honor of self.
Story_ID: 633846
Speaker 1: And the Nation you came into was, it was very vibrant, really, was, wasn't it 'cause a lot of business and--
Speaker 2:  	Very vibrant.
Speaker 1: --the schools?
Speaker 2:  	Very vibrant.  You know, my god, it was filled with young people and women and very, very vibrant.  We didn't have much in the beginning, but we started small, but you could see the growth and development of the Nation of Islam, and he was trying--Elijah Muhammad was trying to show us that if you pooled your resources, you could have farmland.  You could get into international trade and commerce.  And right here in this city, he bought two square blocks.  And he was gonna put up a mosque [Temple No. 2, Chicago, Illinois], a university of Islam and a four hundred bed hospital.  And the city council [Chicago City Council] voted against allowing that man to build that kind of structure here in the South Side of Chicago [Illinois].  And they put up a park and gave him back his money.  He had a hard fight here, but in the end, when they had the so called funeral, Mayor Daley [Richard J. Daley] and young Richard Daley [Richard M. Daley] were present to pay respect to Elijah Muhammad.
Story_ID: 633847
Speaker 1: You were writing--there were a couple of plays that you wrote.  I don't know how many plays, but there are a couple of plays that people talk about.  One is the Or--
Speaker 2:  	'Orgena' [Louis X].
Speaker 1: Or-, 'Orgena.'
Speaker 2: A Negro spelled backwards, and in it was a play that we wrote called 'The Trial' [Louis X] where we put the Caucasian on trial for the evils that had been perpetrated against darker people around the world, and that was our mentality at the time.  And I just took his teaching and put it into song, put it into plays and as a cultural way to spread his message.
Speaker 1:  Now, I spent some of yesterday looking at 'The Hate That Hate Produced'.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1:  Yeah, Michael Lomax and what's his name, Mike Wallace--I mean Louis Lomax, sorry, not Michael Lomax.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So you're in, and that, the play is actually, he's, you know--
Speaker 2:  	Yes.
Speaker 1: --it's at the beginning of it, you know, it kind of starts it off.
Speaker 2:  	Right, right, right.
Speaker 1: So I wanted to ask you because part of watching that made me pretty sad because I felt like, gosh, some of the things haven't changed that much, the dissension in our community and it seems like the same old, same old, and fifty, I think fifty, fifty years, 'cause that was 1959 that that, you know, was done.
Speaker 2:  	That's correct.
Speaker 1: And it was the first big spotlight on the Nation, you know (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's correct.
Speaker 1: So I wanted to ask you how was that viewed within, you know, the Nation because--
Speaker 2:  	Well, we were hurt by the way--
Speaker 1: It was portrayed?
Speaker 2:  	--Mike Wallace and Louis Lomax had portrayed the Nation.  And it was Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] who talked the Honorable Elijah Muhammad into an interview like that.  And the interview was taken, but then it was cut up and put in a way that was not designed to bring any credit to the Nation, but to bring us to national public attention as a hate group.  And he succeeded in that effort.  And from there, Time magazine, Newsweek magazine, Life magazine, all the magazines and periodicals in American began writing about Elijah Muhammad and the Nation of Islam.
Speaker 1: So how much access did they have 'cause it wasn't clear to me.  I know that they had, they'd gone and videotaped, you know, Malcolm speaking at the, at the--they had the interview with Minister--
Speaker 2:  	They had some, some access.  And then, of course, here in Chicago [Illinois], they sent a black man in to join, and from whatever he said, they wrote their articles.  Dr. C. Eric Lincoln, a great--I think he was a Presbyterian, I'm not sure.  But he was a pastor and a sociologist.  He wrote the book 'Black Muslims in America' ['The Black Muslims in America,' C. Eric Lincoln] and this introduced us to scholarship now, about people in libraries and people who wanted to read about us.  And then others came, Essien Udom came and wrote on the Nation as black nationalism ['Black Nationalism: A Search for an Identity in America,' E.U. Essien Udom].  And then others wrote dissertations on the educational program of the Nation of Islam.  And so there was a lot of sociologists interested in the family structure, the family life and these kinds of things that really the Nation was really phenomenal at.  And then, of course, you know the Counterintelligence Program [COINTELPRO] of the U.S. government in putting agents in our ranks to disrupt and what not.  But in spite of all of that, the Nation kept growing, and one success after another under the guidance of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
Story_ID: 633848
Speaker 1: I mean both, both of the things that you mentioned, or people looking at it at the Nation [Nation of Islam], how was the Nation able to, to or how even was Elijah Muhammad, how was he able to sustain all the pressure 'cause that was a--I mean it wasn't thought that it was gonna draw the focus the way it did, but it drew a lot of focus.  And then you--
Speaker 2:  	Well, we were insulated because our internal strength was such.  It's like pressure in your body.  According to physical law, there are 14.7 pounds of atmospheric pressure on every square inch of your body.  But you don't feel it because as you breathe in, you have a force within, pushing out that equalizes the force of the atmospheric pressure on you so you don't feel it.  So because we had something on the inside pushing out with the strength, maybe even stronger than the force that was pushing in on us, we didn't only survive, we thrived under the kind of pressure and evil talk that the government and others were doing.  In fact, Elijah Muhammad said, "If you took out a full page ad in The New York Times and cussed me out word for word, line by line, paragraph by paragraph, you would only help me."  And that proved to be true.  The more evil they said against us, the more we grew.
Speaker 1: 'Cause people were attracted to what was here?
Speaker 2:  	Um-hm.
Story_ID: 633849
Speaker 1: The thing I want to ask you is, in this period from like 19--like the next, you know, twelve to thirteen years, I'd like to know more of what was happening within the Nation?  Like you had--how long were you head of the Boston temple [Temple No. 11; Muhammad Mosque No. 11] in Boston [Massachusetts]?  You were there--
Speaker 2:  	I was there nine years.
Speaker 1: Nine years.  Now, was it during that nine year period that your mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan] also joined?  Did she join at that time?
Speaker 2:  	Yes, she joined. Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So what are the developments within that nine year period that you're proud of that happened with your time there?
Speaker 2:  	Well, I mean the mosque was exceedingly successful.  Our growth was phenomenal, and up and down Blue Hill Avenue, there were several businesses that the believers, the mosque didn't own any businesses, but the believers just went into business, barbershop, beauty salon, restaurants, grocery stories, haberdasheries, used car lots, oil business.  I mean believers were just doing things to show our desire to be self-independent and learning to patronize your own, spending your money with your own.  So that was a great accomplishment for us at that time in our development.
Speaker 1: And how many temples were there at that time?  Was there--I think I read some place that it was twenty--
Speaker 2:  	No, there were many--let me see.  At what time?
Speaker 1: In that period of time from '59 [1959] 'til, let's see, sixty--I guess '8 [1968].  I thought--
Speaker 2:  	If you got one of the older Muhammad Speaks newspapers [Muslim Journal], I'm sure we were up well, let me see, temple--yeah, we were, if you're going to sixty--what?  Sixty-four [1964]--
Speaker 1: Yeah, '64 [1964], um-hm.
Speaker 2:  	--sixty-five [1965].  Maybe around thirty-five or forty temples at that time.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  I think, even in '59 [1959] I had read something like there were twenty-two or something like that.  Maybe I'm not right?
Speaker 2:  	It was more than that.
Speaker 1: It was more than that.
Speaker 2:  	Because 22 was Pittsburgh [Temple No. 22; Muhammad Mosque No. 22, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  Twenty-three was Buffalo, New York [Temple No. 23; Muhammad Mosque No. 23], 24 was Richmond, Virginia [Temple No. 24; Muhammad Mosque No. 24], 25 was Newark, New Jersey [Temple No. 25; Masjid Imam Ali K. Muslim].  All of those places were here in, in the '60s [1960s] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Sixties [1960s]. Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --um-hm. Before Malcolm [Malcolm X] was assassinated.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 633850
Speaker 1: Now, what are you learning about leadership, you know, because you went from--I'm, I, you went from performing to actually, really, in relatively short order being a leader.  So what are you, yourself, learning about what it takes (unclear) as (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) To be very honest, you know, I never saw myself as a leader at all.  I was a minister of a mosque [Temple No. 11; Muhammad Mosque No. 11, Boston, Massachusetts].  I could express the teachings in such a way that people would just get up and join.  But I lacked administrative skill.  You know, it's one thing to attract people.  It's another thing to administrate them well enough to keep the spirit of joy in their lives.  So I was just a youngster that had never administrated anything, and didn't even know that I could speak.  But there were elders in the mosque that would help me and guide me in a sense.  But it was growing.  I was not really knowledgeable of leadership and all of that.  I had to gradually grow, grow, grow, continue to grow, and I'm still growing right now into what leadership is.  But I look at leadership today as the way God uses a head on a body.  The head is very, very important to the overall function of the body.  Our major senses are all here, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking, you know.  So when you're a leader, it seems to me, thinking for what is in the best interests of the body that you're serving and battling the forces that don't want to see black leadership evolve to be able to lead black people in the most constructive manner.  So we suffer from lack of quality in our leadership.  And it's not that we're bad people, but there's ignorance that accompanies us and ego development problems that cause us to feel threatened by people of intelligence that might wanna gather around us.  Somehow we always have to be the center of attraction, attention, and leadership is preparing others to lead.  Leadership is recognizing where you're strong and where you are not.  So you gather around you people who compliment your strength and cover your weakness by their strength.  And then managing all these disparate elements and keeping a kind of spirit in them that they can overlook each other's idiosyncrasies because there is a cause bigger than all our defects that will force us to focus more on the cause than on each other.  And while the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, see, the cause of the rise of our people is what kept us working as a cohesive unit, even though there were serious internal problems among us, the cause always kept our focus, so to speak, on the prize which was the rise of our people.

Speaker 1: So back then, what was the largest mosque, temple, I'm sorry.  I keep saying mosque, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2:  	(Simultaneous) It's okay.  He changed it from temple to mosques at a certain point, but the largest mosque was New York [New York].  Malcolm [Malcolm X], just was a very special human being, very attractive, and he was not self- he was not selfish.  He gave young people that would come in the mosque that had some desire to help, he'd put you in a class and then shove you out.  So when Malcolm was a young minister in New York, that was Mosque No. 7 York [Temple No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York].  Eight was already established in San Diego [Temple No. 8; Masjidul Taqwa San Diego, San Diego, California].  Malcolm did not establish San Diego [California], but when Malcolm came in, it was 7.  Malcolm helped organize Mosque No. 11 in Boston [Temple No. 11; Muhammad Mosque No. 11, Boston, Massachusetts]; Mosque No. 12 in Philadelphia [Temple No. 12; Masjid Makkah, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]; Mosque No. 13 in Springfield [Temple No. 13, Springfield, Massachusetts]; Mosque No. 14 in Hartford [Temple No. 14, Hartford, Connecticut]; Mosque No. 15 in Atlanta [Temple No. 15, Atlanta, Georgia].  Malcolm traveled, I mean just helping mosques to grow.  Sixteen is in--I think it was in Michigan [Temple No. 16; Wali Mahmoud Islamic Center, Lansing, Michigan], and 17 [Temple No. 17, Joliet, Illinois], 18 [Temple No. 18, Cleveland, Ohio] and the last--Malcolm sent a group out to California to organize the West Coast.  So it was through Malcolm's work and the believers from New York under his training, Mosque No. 27 [Temple No. 27] in Los Angeles, California was established.  So Malcolm was just very heavy as an organizer in the Nation [Nation of Islam].
Story_ID: 633852
Speaker 1: It was Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] who started the paper in New York [New York] with Louis Lomax helping him.  It was called Mr. Muhammad Speaks.  But when Chicago [Illinois] took it over, it was called Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal], and then, of course, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad blew it up and it became the number one weekly newspaper in the country.  Then Elijah Muhammad had us purchasing thousands of acres of farmland.  I mean the man was a visionary, but in 1974, he called me to Chicago, and he said--no, it wasn't '74 [1974].
Speaker 2: It was before '74 [1974].
Speaker 1:  	Maybe in '72 [1972] or '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Because in '72 [1972], he called me to Chicago, and he said, "Brother, I have invested the poor people's money into all of these enterprises, and we are about to lose them all due to poor management."  He said, "I want you to bring the learned people out of New York.  And I want to apprise them of the Nation's [Nation of Islam] condition and allow them to help me."  So I brought, I don't remember how many planeloads of people to Chicago.  And Elijah Muhammad gave them a lecture and let them go.  And I wondered then, why did he do that?  Why did he ask me to bring all of these learned people and then never sat down with them to share with them the problems of the Nation that some of them might have been able to help him.  But he had already told me and us that the Nation was gonna take a fall, but that it would rise, and it would never fall again.  So I began to see after he was gone, and the Nation took its turn and did fall, that, wow, I had to--I hated to see his name written out of history, all the good work that he had done.  And so I decided in 1977 to try to rebuild his work, not necessarily in opposition to his son Imam W.D. Muhammad [Wallace D. Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed], but I saw a genuine need for what Elijah Muhammad was teaching and what Elijah Muhammad was doing.  So we started with nothing, and by the grace of God, we began to grow, and--but we were opposed on all sides, and as we still are, but with God's help we'll, we'll succeed.

Speaker 1: December the 14th, 2010.
Speaker 2: And our location?
Speaker 1: 4855 South Woodlawn Avenue [Chicago, Illinois], the national house of the Nation of Islam.
Story_ID: 633854
Speaker 1: Minister Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], I want to--when we were last here, we were up to nineteen seventy- (cough) four [1974], but I wanna take us back.  I'd like to first though, and remember that I want you to bring yourself, 'cause this is about your story, that even that I said that I wanna start, can you give us a short lesson on the history of the Nation of Islam?  Can we start with that, sir?
Speaker 2: That's, that's a very big question with an even bigger answer because it has to do with prophesy and the fulfillment of prophesy.  And if you would look in your Bible in the Book of Genesis, around the fifteenth chapter, God is talking to Abraham.  And he said to Abraham, "Know of assuredly that your seed is going to be a stranger in a strange land for four hundred years.  And they will be afflicted in that land.  But after they have served this four hundred years, I, God speaking, will come and judge that nation which they shall serve.  And afterwards shall they come out with great substance and go to their fathers in peace and be buried in a good, old age" [Genesis 15:13 - 15].  We have the children of Israel going into bondage in Egypt for four hundred years.  And God's punishment of pharaoh and the destruction of the power of Egypt and bringing the children of Israel out and settling them in a land of their own.  In the Book of Deuteronomy, God, again, in the eighteenth chapter, is speaking to Abraham.  And he said, "I," God talking, "am going to raise them up a prophet, like unto you, Moses.  I'm gonna put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him" [Deuteronomy 18:18].  Now, you have a situation where there's going to be a man like Moses, and you can't have a man like Moses unless you have a condition like the children of Israel suffered under pharaoh.  So here we are now in a strange land.  America is not our home.  And for every year that we have lived in this land, we have been afflicted even up to the very moment that we are having this conversation.  But the scripture is clear, that God would come after his people that were lost.  Jesus gave this parable of the lost sheep, the prodigal son.  All of it is referring, as the Honorable Elijah Muhammad taught us, to ourselves.  So out of the East a man came, and the Bible in the Book of Matthew says, "As lightning shineth from the East, even unto the West, so shall the coming of the son of man be in the destruction of the wicked" [Matthew 24:27].  In the days of Noah, the scripture says, "As it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be at the coming of the son of man" [Matthew 24:37; Luke 17:26].
Story_ID: 633855
Speaker 1: And when God sent the angels to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah because of their behavior which in both the Bible and the Qur'an [Koran], it says that they were guilty of a behavior that no one had ever practiced before them, males coming to males with lust in their heart as they should a female.  So after God visited destruction on Sodom and Gomorrah, the scripture says: as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah, so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man.  So we believe that God came and visited America as it was prophesied that He would do, and that He would raise up one from among an afflicted people that would be a man likened to Moses.  And after we had been in this country four hundred years and afflicted, we believe God came in the person of Master Fard Muhammad [Wallace Fard Muhammad] and raised up Elijah Muhammad to be a modern Moses to deliver us out of the grip of a modern pharaoh.  So the history of the Nation started, we believe, in fulfillment of that prophesy.  It started in Detroit [Michigan] where he came to a place called Black Bottom where our people were in the worst condition, and he began raising us up to a moral and spiritual and intellectual level with revelation that he gave to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad unlike anything that was in the world before.  So for the last eighty years, the Nation of Islam has produced for black people first.  If you liked Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X], he came from Elijah Muhammad.  And from Brother Malcolm who was a victim of the educational system of America.  He only went to the eighth grade of school.  And when his teacher told him that he would make a great carpenter after he told her that he wanted to be a lawyer, he left school and became a criminal.  Well, while he was in prison, his brother [Reginald Little] had been touched by the teachings of Elijah Muhammad and brought the message of Elijah Muhammad to Malcolm in prison.  The rest is history.  He came out, and in thirteen years, he became not only a great leader of black people in America, but world renowned.  Then, I'm gonna close.  I know you, you, you offered me a heck of a beginning to ask me about the history.
Story_ID: 633856
Speaker 1: But if you look at the Nation, before us, there was Noble Drew Ali and the Moorish Science Temple [Moorish Science Temple of America].  There was Marcus Garvey, and you know Marcus Garvey was effected by Duse Mohamed [Duse Mohamed Ali], a Muslim.  And that touched Mr. Garvey, and Mr. Garvey came from Jamaica and gave us a nationalist perspective of returning to Africa.  Now, you have Noble Drew Ali.  Then you have Fard Muhammad [Wallace Fard Muhammad], Elijah Muhammad.  Then out of that comes Malcolm [Malcolm X].  Out of that comes Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  Out of that comes Muhammad Ali, out of that comes Warith Deen Mohammed, all of us affected black America like no group ever affected black America.  So the Nation of Islam has a rich history, and from the Nation, you have the whole transition from colored, from Negro, from nigger to the original people of our planet, who then referred to ourselves as the black man.  And because we looked at ourselves without shame anymore of being black, we connected with people of color all over the earth.  And in the '60s [1960s], you had a black movement.  Then the Honorable Elijah Muhammad was so hard on Christianity.  He called it the white man's made, organized religion that they did not give to us except that in the 1700s, they thought it was not incompatible for us to be Christians and slaves.  So they taught us a kind of Christianity that made us totally docile, subservient to the enemy, using scriptures like if they slap you on one cheek, turn the other.  If they take your coat, go give them your pants.  Love your enemy, all those kinds of teachings were designed to make us, not just a slave for a day, but a perpetual slave.  And so Elijah Muhammad's teaching inspired what is now a black theology.  And out of that, you have Carruthers [HistoryMaker Jacob H. Carruthers, Jr.].  You have Reverend Wright [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.].  You have, out of that coming a whole plethora of black Christians now who are showing blackness in the bible.  Reverend Al Sampson [HistoryMaker Reverend Albert Richard Sampson] from here was one of the architects of a Bible with all these black figures in it.  So that's the little capsule of our history; sorry, it took so long, but that's your fault (laughter).
Speaker 2: No, just--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) But I enjoyed it immensely (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, no, no laughing, please, no laughing please, okay.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 633857
Speaker 1: Just one thing.  Can you give me dates that you think are critical in the, the Nation's [Nation of Islam] history?  What specific time periods--
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: --and for what reasons?
Speaker 2: You, you know, honest, may I say this?  Your questioning has brought from me things that my own son [Joshua Farrakhan], after the last session, said, "Daddy, I heard things that I never heard before."  So I thank you for your line of questioning.  First, it started in Fard Muhammad's [Wallace Fard Muhammad] coming and making himself manifest to us on July 4th, 1930.  He came in the midst of the celebration of America's independence declare, to declare that he had come to separate us from our enemies and declare our independence and that we ultimately would be fulfilling a prophesy that we would also have a land of our own.  So 1930 is critical.  He left us in 1934.  In fulfillment of a scripture that as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish, three days and three nights, so shall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth.  When you look at a map today, the globe, you see America--North America, Central [Central America] and South America as like the heart of our globe.  And the heart of America at that time is Detroit [Michigan], the automobile mecca, not only of America, but of the world.  And as steel became the fluid like for the heart, Detroit, producing automobiles, it was pumping the industrial economy of America.  And it was in that place that he came, and he stayed among us for three years and four months.  And he left.  But during that time, he taught twenty-five thousand or more in Detroit and gave them holy names.  Holy names meaning that the names that we presently have are the names of our former slave masters.  We don't know our original African or Islamic names.  So Malcolm was Malcolm X, X meaning the unknown because we didn't know our name, our language, our culture, our history, our God, our religion.  So he gave out twenty-five thousand holy names.  And when we say a holy name, we--Elijah Muhammad taught, are direct descendants of God himself.  And we should not wear the names of the creation, Mr. Wood, Mr. Tree, Roundtree, Mr. Fish, Mr. Brown, Mr. Yellow, Mr. Black.  These are colors or objects created by God, and we are from God so we should wear the name of God and not the name of some of his creatures when we predated all of that.
Story_ID: 633858
Speaker 1: Now, when he [Wallace Fard Muhammad] disappeared, was there any indication, did, did--was there any indication where he went?  Was there a look for him, you know, did people look for him?
Speaker 2: No, he told Elijah Muhammad when he left, according to what the Honorable Elijah Muhammad said to me and others, that he told him that, "You don't need me anymore."  And Elijah Muhammad with tears in his eyes was saying, "Oh, yes, I do."  He was only three years and four months into the teaching of this master teacher.  And so he felt terrible that his teacher was leaving.  And he said, when he shook his hand leaving, he pressed into his hand a piece of paper.  And when the teacher left, he opened the paper, and it was the 23rd Psalm.  And he wanted him to understand that the Lord is your shepherd, and you won't want for anything that you won't be able to accomplish.  And even though he walked in the valley of the shadow of death, he absolutely taught a teaching that black people hearing it were afraid even to think the thoughts that Elijah Muhammad spoke.  And he lived to leave here without anyone taking his life--
Story_ID: 633859
Speaker 1: So the beginning is critical, sir.  So what is the next period of time (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The next period would be the time that he [Wallace Fard Muhammad] left and chose Elijah Muhammad as his representative.  It was not long after he left that there was an upheaval in the Nation [Nation of Islam] because Elijah Muhammad was telling the believers that this man that was among us for three years and four months was not a prophet.  He was the fulfillment of the scriptures of God's coming.  And that created upset, and then hypocrisy arose in the ranks of the Nation.  And at that time, people wanted to harm Elijah Muhammad, take his life.  So he fled Chicago [Illinois].  This was his base.  He left Detroit [Michigan].  You know, he was arrested in Detroit, and they called it contributing to the delinquency of a minor.  But in truth, he took all our children out of the public schools and began teaching them himself because he knew that the public school was not gonna create a free thinking black man or woman.  So they asked him to put his children back in the public school.  And he refused, so he was arrested along with the teachers.  And he went to court, and there was a fight.  And all of these things, but we suffered just to be able to have independent education.  And now, of course, we can have independent education, but he paid a price for that.  So, he ran.  And from here, he fled to Milwaukee [Wisconsin].  And Milwaukee then became Temple No. 3.  Temple No. 1 was Detroit [Masjid Wali Muhammad, Detroit, Michigan].  Temple No. 2, Chicago [Illinois]; Temple No. 3, Detroit--I mean Milwaukee.  He left Milwaukee, went to Washington, D.C.  His teacher gave him 104 books to study; 103 of them were in the congressional library in Washington [Library of Congress].  So he spent in--coming in and out of Washington, D.C., studying.  Temple No. 5 was Cincinnati, Ohio.  Number 6 [Temple No. 6] is Baltimore, Maryland; 7 New York [Temple No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York]; 8 San Diego [Temple No. 8; Masjidul Taqwa San Diego, San Diego, California]--not that he went out there, but the teachings went.  Well--
Speaker 1: So this is what time period?  From 19 (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) From 1934.  Now, he had seven years from '34 [1934] to '41 [1941] when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor [Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii].  Then in '42 [1942], [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued an executive order that he should be arrested because they did not want him teaching black people that we don't fight for the enemy, you know.  We have nothing to gain for it.  So that kind of teaching, the government did not want.  So they arrested him, and they sent him--they arrested him in, I think in Baltimore, and they took him to Washington.  He was sent to prison from there to Milan, Michigan where he spent five years in prison [Federal Correctional Institution, Milan, Milan, Michigan].  So from '42 [1942] to '46 [1946] and near '7 [1947], he comes out of prison.
Story_ID: 633860
Speaker 1: So who's running the Nation [Nation of Islam] while he's in prison (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, he had help in his dear wife [Clara Muhammad] and ministers.  But the Nation was very small.
Speaker 1: How small at that point?
Speaker 2: Well, when he went to prison, it was four mosques, four or five mosques.
Speaker 1: How many people do you think at that point?
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know numbers.  But I would imagine it was small.  So when he comes out of prison, he had to like literally start again, which he did, here in Chicago [Illinois].  And then in 1949, '50 [1950], '51 [1951], Brother Malcolm started corresponding with Elijah Muhammad, and then the rest is history.  Malcolm comes out of prison.  There were a few followers in Baltimore [Maryland], in Washington [D.C.].  That's No. 6. [Temple No. 6, Baltimore, Maryland]  Washington is 4 [Temple No. 4; Masjid Muhammad, Washington, D.C.].  But Malcolm, there were a few followers in New York [New York], but Brother Malcolm helped grow the mosque in Philadelphia [Temple No. 12; Masjid Makkah, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania], the mosque in New York [Temple No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York].  He started growing the mosque in Boston [Temple No. 11; Muhammad Mosque No. 11, Boston, Massachusetts], in Hartford [Temple No. 14, Hartford, Connecticut], in Springfield [Temple No. 13, Springfield, Massachusetts], in Atlanta [Temple No. 15, Atlanta, Georgia].  Malcolm was a great force inside the Nation for growth, development.  I am a student of Malcolm X.  I came in under him.  He was the first real man in my life, and where I am today, regardless of the history and the turn in the Nation, I owe a lot of my development to Brother Malcolm.  And, of course, that date--then, of course, I came in the Nation in 1955.  But in 1954, Elijah Muhammad was preaching about Moses, and the helper that Moses had in Aaron who Moses had an impediment of speech, but Aaron was very articulate.  And so he said, in '54 [1954], he was waiting for his little helper to come.  And as I mentioned the last time, I was at the Blue Angel [Chicago, Illinois] downtown at 801 North Rush Street, and I went to Saviours' Day 1955, and Elijah Muhammad had me placed because Malcolm had told him that this young musician, very popular in Boston [Massachusetts] was gonna be a guest at Saviours' Day.  And I don't know whether I said it the last time, but he positioned me in a way where he could look up and see what I looked like.  And as I may have told you, I was critical of his speech because growing up in Boston and having a good background in English, I was critical of his non-subject and verb agreement, and he looked up in my face and said, "Brother, I didn't get that mighty fine education that you got."  He said, "When I got to the school, the door was closing.  But don't you pay any attention to how I'm saying it.  You pay attention to what I'm saying.  Then you take it and put it in that fine language that you know."  And to this day, he gave me my assignment the first day he laid eyes on me, and here I am today, taking his message and delivering it to the ends of the earth, not only now a message to the black man, but since all human beings, he taught, came from the black man, then we are the father and mother of all human beings that you see.  So the message to the black man has to include everything that came from us, but that's the universal aspect of his teaching.
Story_ID: 633861
Speaker 1: I close that point with this: (Pause) Jesus, when he first started speaking to his disciples, he gave them an order: go ye not in the way of the Gentiles nor even in the way of the Samaritans, but go ye to the lost sheep of the house of Israel [Matthew 10:5 - 6].  And then at a certain point, as Jesus is departing the world, he tells his disciples, "Go ye into all the world and preach this gospel to every nation, kindred and tongue" [Mark 16:15].  So as his message started very narrowly in the beginning, it became universal.  And if you remember, Peter had a vision, and then he started taking the teaching from the Jews, specifically, to the Gentiles.  And then Paul comes, and he's the great preacher of the message of Jesus to the Gentiles.  And from there, it spread through the known world.  Well, then, of course, in 1964--in '63 [1963], November, President John F. Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is assassinated.  Elijah Muhammad writes to all of his, his ministers and he tells us, "Say nothing about the assassination of the president."  And he was due to speak in New York [New York] at the Manhattan Center, and he declined to come.  And Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] went to him and said, "We have spent a lot of money preparing for you to come.  Would it be all right if I spoke in your place?"  And the Honorable Elijah Muhammad said, "Yes, you can, but do nothing, say nothing about the assassination of the president."  Well, Brother Malcolm spoke, and there was a reporter from The New York Times that had visited.  And the captain of the mosque [Temple No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York], Brother Yusuf [Yusuf Shah], sent the reporter away.  When Brother Malcolm heard that The New York Times reporter had been sent away, he sent Joseph to go get him and bring him back.  Malcolm went through the lecture, perfect, but in the question and answer period, they raised the question about the assassination of the president, and he said something about the chickens coming home to roost and, "I'm never sad when the chickens come home to roost."  Well, when the report came into the press, it was as though Brother Malcolm had mocked the death of the most charismatic of all the presidents of the United States in modern history.  And many of the believers that become converts to Islam in prison, they're under white, Catholic gods, and persecution started.  So the Honorable Elijah Muhammad did two things.  He silenced Brother Malcolm for ninety days.  That was to wait until the redness had come out of the eyes of the American people that had mourned the loss of the president.  And then Elijah Muhammad had a headline in the Muhammad Speaks [Muslim Journal], "We mourn the death of our president." Wise man, trying to maneuver us in a very difficult time.  During that time, Brother Malcolm was not to do any public speaking, and, of course, at that time, I was the first minister to go into New York when Malcolm was silenced.  And I spoke that Sunday, and Malcolm came and picked me up and took me to his home at 2311 - 97th Street in Long Island [New York], or East Elmhurst, Long Island.  And Betty [Betty Shabazz] made some soup for us to eat.
Story_ID: 633862
Speaker 1: Coming to New York [New York], you were right after the statement (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That's right.  And during the dinner that Betty Shabazz--may God be pleased with her.  She--no one was in the dining room but Malcolm and myself.  And that's when he shared with me some of the personal life of Elijah Muhammad having children from some of his secretaries.  And he said, "Well, I could get them on the telephone.  And I could trick them into saying, so you could know that I'm telling the truth."  And I said, "Brother, you don't have to do that.  I, I believe what you're saying."  So after dinner, he drove me to the airport.  At that time, the airport was preparing for the--New York was preparing for the World, what is it?  The World's Fair [New York World's Fair].  And so as Malcolm was driving me to the airport, he said, "I don't want you to say anything to anyone about what I shared with you today."  And I said, "No, I won't say it anyone but the Honorable Elijah Muhammad."  And I saw him jump in the chair, and I couldn't sleep that night.  I went back to Boston [Massachusetts].  My dear wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan] was sleeping so peacefully, but I could not sleep.  I was troubled by what he told me.  And we usually get up around five a.m. for our morning prayer, and so Brother Malcolm called me at approximately five a.m.  And he said, "Brother Louis [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], I wish that you would hold off writing to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad until I get a chance to write him and explain."  And I said to him, "Brother, it will take me some time just to collect my thoughts to write such a letter, so if you can get your letter off in that time, fine.  But I do not wish to be in the middle of a conflict between two great men."  And he said, "Well, Brother Louis, there's only one great man."  I said, "Well, I'm aware of that," but in my mind, Malcolm was the greatest helper to Elijah Muhammad, and I would have given my life at any time to save his life because to me, Elijah Muhammad had no greater helper than Malcolm X.  So that morning after we hung up the phone, I went in my study.  And I picked up my Holy Qur'an [Koran], and usually when we pick up the Qur'an, we will say (speaking Arabic), in the name of God, the gracious, the compassionate, and we would put the Qur'an to our forehead and we would kiss the front and the back and then open.  All that means is when you read the words of God, you want to read with his help and in his name.  And when you put the book to your head, it means that everything that's in this book, you want it to be a part of your thinking, and you kiss both covers because you love the word of God from the front to the back, and even if there are things in it with which you have a problem, yet your love of God and your love of his word, even those things that you don't understand, you have faith and patience until understanding comes.
Story_ID: 633863
Speaker 1: Well, that morning, I was desperate because I'm hurting now.  And I opened the book to the thirty-third chapter [Surah Al Ahzab] of the Holy Qur'an [Koran], and in that chapter, when I opened it, it's talking about the prophet's life, domestic life.  And the prophet had wives, not concubines, not women that were loose women, but he was given permission to marry in the Qur'an, up to nine women.  And when I read that, and then I read the footnotes of how the orientalist, the scholars, when they looked at the prophet's life, they referred to him as a voluptuary, as a vile kind of man because he took Aisha who was his youngest wife, he married her when she was eleven.  And they had conjugal relations when she was fourteen.  But when I read all of this, I immediately called Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X].  I said, "Brother, I was studying the Qur'an this morning, and there's something I wanna share with you."  He said, "Well, get on the plane and come on."  So I jumped on a plane.  At that time, there was a shuttle, shuttle flight going from Boston [Massachusetts] to New York [New York].  And the fare was only fourteen dollars, which was a lot because we were not rich, but I made it over to New York.  He picked me up in that same blue Oldsmobile that is at Malcolm X College [Chicago, Illinois].  And we drove.  And I said, "Brother Malcolm, I read in the Qur'an about the prophet's life," and he rebuked me.  He said, "I know all of that, brother."  He said, "You can't handle this."  He said, "You leave that to me."  I said, "Yes, sir."  He took me back to the airport, and I went back to Boston.
Story_ID: 633864
Speaker 1: Well, during that time of his being silenced, he was not to speak to the press.  And from what I understood, he spoke to some members of the press, and Elijah Muhammad then, instead of just silencing him, put him out.  Elijah Muhammad called me on the telephone, and he said these words to me that, "After Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] fulfills his time, I will put him over all of the Nation's [Nation of Islam] businesses, and then gradually bring him back into the ministry."  Why did he tell me that?  Because he knew that I was a disciple of Malcolm and that I loved him and probably that I would share those thoughts with Brother Malcolm.  But in my heart, though I loved him, I wanted to see what his behavior would be toward his teacher after the teacher took him from prison.  The NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] would not have had Malcolm nor would the Urban League [National Urban League].  You know our people and these organizations.  They don't take somebody from prison and give them a chance to be somebody great.  But Elijah Muhammad did that, not only for Malcolm, but for many of his early followers.  In fact, I was one of the first of his followers to even have a college education.  I said, one of the first, not the first.  Well, after that, we're now in late, in December.  January comes, Malcolm is out, and February, it's Saviours' Day again, '64 [1964].  And Elijah Muhammad chooses me to open up for him on that day.  I did, and the next month Brother Malcolm broke ranks with the Nation and then began to say that Elijah Muhammad had sex with his--I shouldn't even repeat it, teenage secretaries and spoke of his teacher in a vulgar and vile way.  I'll close this part of it with this, although Elijah Muhammad took on these wives, and it created a split, and he has been castigated for that, you know the history now, because when Elijah Muhammad departed, his son [Wallace D. Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed] became the leader of the Nation.  And the son condemned the father and took the Nation in a totally different direction.  If you came to the mosque today and heard my assistant minister [Ishmael Muhammad] who is the biological son of Elijah Muhammad, but if you heard that young man preach, now, Elijah Muhammad has a son that not only believes in his father and his father's teachings, but is not only the biological son, but a spiritual son as well.  This young man and his brothers and sisters are the witness that what God ordered him to do in taking wives, not to have concubines, but to produce children that at a later time would come up and help him in his assignment.
Story_ID: 633865
Speaker 1: So now, you have '64 [1964], Malcolm [Malcolm X] leaving.  Muhammad Ali coming and becomes the heavyweight champion of the world.  So as Brother Malcolm exits the state, Ali comes.  But he's Cassius Clay.  Elijah Muhammad gives him the name Muhammad Ali.  And as the heavyweight champion of the world, he now is known all over the Muslim world because he has Muslim name, Muhammad Ali.  And, you know, they kept trying to call him Clay, and he said, "No, my name is Muhammad Ali."  And he beat one fighter, I think it was the former champion (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)(unclear)--
Speaker 1: Patterson [Floyd Patterson], who refused to call his name.  So every time he jabbed him (gesture), "What's my name?"  He beat that poor man pitifully, but today, Muslims in football and basketball and any kind of sport can wear the name of God and suffer no ridicule because somebody went in front and paid the price.
Story_ID: 633866
Speaker 1: Let's go back to '64 [1964].  And I wanna know, when this is happening, there's no, no pause in your conviction at that point, no split between--you know, you said that you couldn't sleep that night that you went back to Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Is there any pause at all in your conviction?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: None, now, why?
Speaker 2: Well, first, you know, I'm not here to judge my teacher.  What I--in my last dialogue with you, I told you that all my life, I was looking for somebody who would help to deliver black people from our oppression.  When I found that in Elijah Muhammad and the word that the taught me, and I gave up my musical life to teach this word.  And now I hear something about him that appears negative, but when you hear negative, you weigh that against what is positive.  And what was positive?  Is what Elijah Muhammad did for me, and what he was doing for thousands of others, and what I was enabled to do by using his word to open the eyes of thousands and thousands of people.  So I was not gonna judge my teacher, especially when I believe he's a messenger of God.  Go look in your Bible and see how many of the messengers only had one wife, and start with Abraham, the father of the righteous.  See, so when you start judging a man that comes directly to you from God, you're walking in shoes that may cause you to stumble and fall.  And it did cause Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] to stumble and fall.  And it angered the Nation of Islam to such a degree that there was idea of murder in the hearts of the Muslim community for Brother Malcolm.
Story_ID: 633867
Speaker 1: So what do you think was happen- happening with Malcolm [Malcolm X] at that time?  He was getting a lot of attention, right, in the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: He had become in many ways the spokesperson for the Nation, right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was.  He was.  Well, look at Negroes.  Now, I got to come back to that term Negro now.  Look at us.  When, you know that story that they always told about us.  We're like crabs in a barrel, that when one starts rising, the other crab will pull it down.  That's in every church, in every black organization.  Malcolm was the object of intense envy because he was loved by the Honorable Elijah Muhammad and the family of Elijah Muhammad, and he was loved outside of the Nation, greater than any minister of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  So many of the ministers envied him.  He was my teacher.  I loved him.  I never was envious of him, but I wanted to see him successful.  Okay, so now, Malcolm suffered.  He was the one that started the newspaper.  It was called Mr. Muhammad Speaks [Muhammad Speaks; Muslim Journal].  He started it in New York [New York], with Louis Lomax, the very man that was the architect of 'The Hate That Hate Produced,' and then wrote a book on Elijah Muhammad.  Again, oh, so then the paper came to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So you're--so, wait a minute.  You're saying--what year was Muhammad Speaks, when did it start?
Speaker 2: I think it's '61 [1961] or '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay, so like three years--two or three years after the documentary, right, the Mike Wallace--
Speaker 2: The documentary was in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Fifty-nine [1959], right.
Speaker 2: Right.  So, now, with that documentary, of course, that was another time in the Nation of Islam where the Nation of Islam was in every newspaper, every magazine.  But we were a hate group.  We were anti-white, anti-American and all this kind of stuff.  And the police were attacking the mosques under the inspiration of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  So all of these things were happening around the time of the assassination of Brother Malcolm.
Speaker 1: But at the same time, the ranks of the Nation are growing, even with that, with the documentary--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  In fact, the Nation took on greater growth.  The more they attacked Elijah Muhammad, the more the Nation grew.  So when Brother Malcolm left, yes, there were followers that left with him that were upset by this revelation that Elijah Muhammad had conceived children through some of his former secretaries.  But they were actually his wives.  So, now, from that point--
Speaker 1: How many mosques are there at that point--or temples?  Was it temples then still?
Speaker 2: Yeah, temples.
Speaker 1: So, how many were there at this point?
Speaker 2: Oh, boy, that's in '64 [1964]?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: There may have been forty or more--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --temples.  I'm not sure. But they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But was the largest temple still New York [Temple No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York]? Was it the--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Story_ID: 633868
Speaker 1: So, now Malcolm [Malcolm X] is gone and the minister from Newark, New Jersey is temporarily the minister in New York [New York].  In the month of maybe March or April of '65 [1965], Malcolm is assassinated in February.  I get a call from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and he said, "I'm going to assign you to New York to take Brother Malcolm's place."  I don't even remember whether I said, thank you or what not.  I know I hung up the phone, and I never said anything to my wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan].  I went out and got in my little car and drove, crying because I never wanted the place of my brother.  I wanted to secure him in his place.  And after I went to a particular spot where I used to go and park the car and study in a quiet, country like place, I got myself together and went back home and told my wife that Elijah Muhammad was sending me to New York.  He told me that I should--in fact, it was not in March.  It may--I'm not really sure of the time, but I remember when Malcolm was assassinated, that same night that Malcolm was assassinated, a bomb went off that blew up the temple [Temple No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz] in New York.  And I remember calling New York, telling them not to react because the enemy was so among us trying to put us at odds with each other, what better time to do it.  Malcolm is dead on one end.  The mosque is bombed on the other.  So now, if we start killing each other that would make the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], the U.S. government and our enemies very happy.  So I called and advised them, the leadership of New York, not to react at all, but to try to find out who, in fact, bombed the mosque.  So there was no reaction from us.  Now, I may have known at that time that I was going to be the minister in New York because I took it upon myself to give counsel to the laborers in New York, even though there was an interim minister.  And on the day that Malcolm was assassinated, I was asked to come into Newark to speak because the Newark minister was interim in New York, and we were rotating different ministers into the Newark mosque [Temple No. 25; Masjid Imam Ali K. Muslim].  And the day that Brother Malcolm was assassinated was my day to be in Newark.  And I remember teaching that day and going across to the Muslim restaurant to have a bowl of soup and someone came in and said that Malcolm was assassinated.  I got up from the table.  I walked out and walked around the block.  The news was shocking and painful.  And then I got back to Boston [Massachusetts] to my family.  That was February.  By July of that year, I transitioned to New York.  Elijah Muhammad said, "Well, if you don't make it in New York, I'm putting you out in (unclear) in the country somewhere.  New York will make a man out of you or you'll be a boy."  So that was my challenge.
Story_ID: 633869
Speaker 1: Now, a couple questions about that.  Do you think that Malcolm X did go through some internal--I mean that is, where he got to was justified--I mean that he, he really, his trip, you know--
Speaker 2: To Mecca [Saudi Arabia]?
Speaker 1: No, now, why?
Speaker 2: No.  We sent Brother Malcolm to the East in 1959, '59 [1959] to prepare the way for Elijah Muhammad.  We always knew there were white Muslims.  That was no discovery, but since he was going to break from the Nation [Nation of Islam], and he had to find a way back into the civil rights struggle and what not.  So he writes letters from Mecca.  When he went there, they offered him to go to Mecca, and he said, "No, that should go to my leader first."  So even though he was in Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, he never went to Mecca.  So Elijah Muhammad goes in '59 [1959], and goes to Mecca.  Then Malcolm goes, of course, in '64 [1964], and then he writes that he met Muslims that were whiter than white, their eyes bluer than bluer, their hair blonder than blonde, as though it was such a surprise.  Well, if you look at Fard Muhammad's [Wallace Fard Muhammad] picture, what does he look like (laughter)?  So, you know, when you go in the Muslim world, you see white Muslims, you see, of course, people of color in Egypt, my color and a little lighter.  And then in what they call northern Egypt, which is in the south, black, right.  When I went in the Middle East, I was surprised.  In Saudi Arabia, you know, you see these white Muslims, but you look around and you see the servants, they're black.  Well, wait a minute.  Why do you call it Saudi Arabia, comes from an Arabic word, Aswad, black Arabia because the original Arabs are black people.  That whole area was black.  When I went to what they call Israel now which is Palestine to visit the Hebrew Israelites, they took me to Jerusalem, and then they took me to Jericho.  And when I as in Jericho, it was like being on 63rd Street and Cottage Grove [Cottage Grove Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], people, black, walking around.  I saw a man, real dark man, on a donkey.  And I asked him, "How long have you been in this land?"  I couldn't speak the language so my guide from the Hebrew Israelite community who spoke not only Hebrew, but Arabic, asked him.  And he said, "They don't know a time that they have not been there."  When I was in Syria, the Syrians that I met in America were white.  When I got to Syria, I saw black Syrians, black Jordanians, I mean all over that area.  The original people of that area look like you and me.  So Malcolm, by seeing white Muslims and coming back saying that this was like a tuxedo religion, you know, in other words, we, we talked all this black talk, but in Islam, is a brotherhood of black, brown, red, yellow and white. We knew all of that.  He knew it.
Story_ID: 633870
Speaker 1: But our mission was to black people in America as the most afflicted and oppressed minority on our planet, Cadillac driving, Mercedes-Benz driving, high suit wearing, nice house Negroes that are still suffering from a sick slave mentality.  So that ushered in another new era in the Nation [Nation of Islam].  Elijah Muhammad jumped deep now into economic development.  He put out a three year economic savings plan, and right from then, we started buying farmland in Georgia, farmland in Alabama, farmland in Honduras.  Then the Honorable Elijah Muhammad began setting up businesses, I mean big business, doing international trade and commerce.  So all of a sudden now, Elijah Muhammad is ill, but the writers are not calling him the hate teacher anymore.  They're saying the black separatists, but not hate because Elijah Muhammad's work was so magnificent among us 'til Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon] sent people from HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development] here to Chicago [Illinois] to talk with him, and they offered him to match every dollar that he had spent on economic development, they were gonna match it.  And Elijah Muhammad said, "There were too many strings attached, brother, so I wouldn't take their money."
Story_ID: 633871
Speaker 1: --Mosque then.
Speaker 2: It was a mosque then.
Speaker 1: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So when did the temple become the mosque?
Speaker 1: Maybe in the late '50s [1950s], early '60s [1960s], Elijah Muhammad was reaching out to the Muslim world.  And he developed a prayer book ['Muslim Daily Prayers'] for his followers that was the actual prayer service of Islam but in English.  And then he changed it from the Muhammad's temple to Muhammad's mosque.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you know when that was?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure.
Speaker 2: Okay, no problem.  Okay, are we ready?
Speaker 1: (TAPE INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: Let's go back to, 1964 was when yeah, when Muhammad Ali, Cassius Clay, became Muhammad Ali. Can you give the background on how that even happened, how he was either recruited or he came to the Nation [Nation of Islam] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, he definitely was recruited, I think.  Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] was part of that.  And a song that I had written called 'The White Man's Heaven is a Black Man's Hell,' after he heard it, he memorized it.  And it intrigued him, and, of course, Brother Malcolm was the great teacher of Elijah Muhammad--
Speaker 2: But you had written that song before that, right?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.  I wrote it in '59 [1959].  But the point is, he was affected by these things, and Malcolm, he had a gravitational pull towards Brother Malcolm and was a great admirer of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  So, if you recall, he was in Miami [Florida] training for his fight with Sonny Liston, and Brother Malcolm was out during that time period.  And Brother Malcolm visited him, and I'm sure talked with him and encouraged him, Islamically, and then history tells us that Malcolm [sic.] beat Sonny Liston, became heavyweight champion--
Speaker 2: You mean Muhammad Ali.
Speaker 1: Muhammad Ali, I'm sorry, became heavyweight champion, and the next day, he flew to Chicago [Illinois] to be with Elijah Muhammad at Saviours' Day, 1964.  And we became friends at that time.  He was just a magnificent brother who inspired us in the Nation.  I used to love to watch Ali in interviews.  He was supposed to be so uneducated and unlearned, but the best minds of white America could not handle Muhammad Ali.  And I was with Brother Malcolm, as I said, probably in my last dialogue with you that, when he was at Harvard [Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts] and Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut] and other places.  And even though he had an eighth grade education, doctorate degrees couldn't handle Brother Malcolm because Elijah Muhammad's teaching caused us to think outside of the box of white supremacy.  And once you can think outside of the box that white supremacy and their educational system puts you in, then you can look at their system and judge it accurately.  The educational system, the political system, the religious system, all of it worked together to promote the elevation of white people and the degradation of people of color.
Story_ID: 633872
Speaker 1: Malcolm's [Malcolm X] leaving had nothing, it didn't dissuade, even though he had been recruited by Malcolm, it didn't dissuade Muhammad Ali's joining?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: And he became almost the poster child for the Nation [Nation of Islam] at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yes, because it drew a spotlight because he was, you know--
Speaker 2: Heavyweight champion--
Speaker 1: --the heavyweight--
Speaker 2: --of the world.  And after the loss of such a great one as Brother Malcolm, who would fill the void?  Then there was Ali.  And we took such great joy in watching him defend his championship, go in the ring and say his prayers in the corner.  And after he would win, he would give praise to Allah and his teacher Elijah Muhammad.  So he was a wonderful spirit uplift, not only for us, but for black people.  Now, you think about this.  The Vietnam War is raging.  Now, they want Ali to come into the armed services.  He refuses to step across that line--
Story_ID: 633873
Speaker 1: So you were talking about here, you know, here he was and he's embraced the Nation [Nation of Islam], the Nation has embraced him.  A lot of attention is focusing on the, you know, the Nation.  At this point, there's a lot of, the Nation is growing not, you know, financially--I wanna go back though, to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But the thing that I was going to mention was the fact that Muhammad Ali refused to step across that line to become a soldier in the United States Armed Forces.  And when he said, "The Vietcong ain't never called me nigger.  Why am I over in Vietnam fighting somebody that never did anything to me simply because you say he's your enemy," see.  So when Muhammad Ali took that kind of a stand, which at that time, there was a big anti-war movement growing in America, Ali then was stripped of his championship, but then became the people's champion, loved all over the world because he made a principled stand that takes courage and conviction to do.  And he won his case in the [U.S.] Supreme Court and was vindicated.  That's big.  And when you look at Elijah Muhammad, when you look at the courage that it took for him to go to jail first.  He was too old for the draft, but they said he was a draft dodger, and all this kind of stuff to get away from the [President] Franklin Delano Roosevelt executive order that they ordered him to be arrested.  Now, Ali comes back and says, "I'm going to jail. Clean out my cell.  I'm going to jail."  He had it all rhymed up and everything.  It took courage.  He gave people courage to stand up for their convictions.  So did Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X], so did Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], so did the ministers of Elijah Muhammad.  That's the great contribution that the Nation has made to black America.  Look at Huey Newton [Huey P. Newton], look at Kwame Ture, Stokely Carmichael, look at the [HistoryMaker] Maulana Karenga used to visit the mosque [Muhammad Mosque No. 26] in San Francisco [California].  Elijah Muhammad's Nation affected black people, Sam Cooke, the comedian--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dick Gregory.
Speaker 2: Dick Gregory.  I mean, look, the Nation has affected black America.  Everybody hasn't accepted to become a Muslim, but the teachings of Elijah Muhammad created an awakening of our people.  And this is a genie that nothing can put back in the box ever again.  We are on our way, never again to be like we once were.
Story_ID: 633874
Speaker 1: Now, you're at the mosque in New York [New York].  Tell me what shape that mosque is in when you, when you take over in '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the main mosque [Mosque No. 7; Masjid Malcolm Shabazz, New York, New York] was destroyed.  The spirit of the Muslims is somewhat broken because Malcolm [Malcolm X] was not only a great teacher, but he was like a hero to us.  Now, he's gone, and a little fella from Boston [Massachusetts] comes in to be the minister.  Well, the people that were entrenched there, they didn't really think that I could do the job or be successful.  And one of the ministers came to me and said, "Do you think you can ride this horse?"  And I said, "I can sit in the saddle as long as Elijah Muhammad holds the reins. I can ride this horse."  See, they didn't think much of me, which is natural.  I'm coming in the shadow of the greatest minister of the Nation of Islam, yeah.  But God knew my destiny, and Elijah Muhammad did too.  So when Elijah Muhammad departed, I had ten years in New York, and they will tell you.  We didn't vote, but as God is my witness, I could make a call and within a short amount of time, Charlie Rangel [HistoryMaker Charles B. Rangel] would be in my office, the borough president of New York would be in my house, [HistoryMaker] Basil Paterson, the father of the governor of New York [HistoryMaker David A. Paterson] would be in my office.  Believe me, I had so much influence in New York that when the police attacked the mosque, I ordered all white police out of Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: What year was that?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-two [1972].  And they were out of Harlem.  I mean God had blessed me to come into a broken mosque and rebuild its spirit, not only rebuild its spirit.  There was Mosque 7A, which is Harlem; Mosque 7B, Brooklyn; 7C, Brooklyn [Muhammad Mosque No. 7C, Brooklyn, New York]; Mosque 7B [Muhammad Mosque No. 7B] in Long Island [New York] when I got there.  When Elijah Muhammad departed, we had eighteen mosques in New York under my leadership.
Story_ID: 633875
Speaker 1: So by that time, you had learned a lot 'cause remember how you were saying that when you first took over Boston [Temple No. 11; Muhammad Mosque No. 11, Boston, Massachusetts] that you didn't know--you knew you had never run anything.  At this point, you've got all that--you've got experience in it.
Speaker 2: I've gotten experience, but I still wasn't running things.  We had a great captain.  His name was Joseph Yusuf Shah.  He and my secretary, Maceo Hazziez, they were the ones running the administrative part of the mosque [Mosque No. 7, New York, New York].  Elijah Muhammad said, you just concentrate on teaching.  And I did.  There wasn't any place too small for me to go to teach.  I would be in the basement of a house teaching women who had a tea, but it would be Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] there.  And no matter where it was, and after a while, I could drive the streets of New York [New York], people were just standing out there cheering--I'm not making this up.  I had power in New York.  No doubt about it.  And I had the power because I stuck with the message of Elijah Muhammad and the people flocked to the message, okay.  So we, when Malcolm [Malcolm X] left, we didn't have one university.  When I left New York, we had four universities of Islam in New York, eighteen or more businesses, all of them in the black, see.  We were the top mosque in the Nation [Nation of Islam].  Nobody out did us in anything.  And that's the blessing that God gave me.  I went by the grace of God to Boston [Massachusetts].  It was broken, and built it.  When I got to New York, it was broke; we built it.  I came to Chicago [Illinois] with the Nation broken, and God allowed me to build it.  That's my history.  So, you know, whatever history will show of Farrakhan, you know, that's real.  That's not made up.  You can go anywhere and ask in New York about the minister's work there or in Boston or now in Chicago.
Speaker 1: What do you think was key for you building things in New York?  What were the key things in New York--
Speaker 2: The key has always been one thing, my love for God in the person of Master Fard Muhammad [Wallace Fard Muhammad], my love for Elijah Muhammad, my love for the truth that he gave us, my love for black people.  And nothing else made me successful but the love of those men and the love of our people.  People can feel you.  You know, when you're sincere.  See, a lot of people, they gotta, they gotta think about what to say because they have to write it down.  Farrakhan don't write stuff.  You can call me in the middle of the night and give me a subject, and I'll teach you about it because it's in me.  I'm born to do what I'm doing.  When you see Michael Jackson, you don't have to ask, can the boy sing?  He was born to do what he's doing.  I'm born to do what I'm doing.  And God has destined me to do this.  I'm not doing it on my own.  Excuse me for getting passionate, you know.  I can't help myself.
Story_ID: 633876
Speaker 1: But let me get to this part.  See, I suffered being Elijah Muhammad's minister in New York [New York].  In 1974, we had what is called a Black Family Day.  Seventy thousand people show up at Randall's Island [Randall's Island Park, New York, New York].  I'm not making up figures now.  I saw, riding on the bus one day, I saw a black and an Hispanic person fighting on the streets of Harlem [New York, New York].  That thing hurt me so bad, I was determined that the black and brown would come together as a family.  And I worked on that.  So in 1974, we had black family day.  Oh, my God, and Celia Cruz--I don't know whether you've heard of Celia Cruz, Machito, Eddie Palmieri, Illinois Jacquet, everybody.  I mean the place was so packed, I could not drive across the Triborough Bridge [Robert F. Kennedy Bridge] in my automobile.  Brother Akbar [Larry 4X; Abdul Akbar Muhammad] had to take me downtown, put me in a helicopter to fly.  And when I landed in the field, some of Elijah Muhammad's ministers said, "My god, the only way Elijah Muhammad could top this is to come down in the Mother Plane."  (Laughter) (gesture) Envy.  You can't be successful among our people without attracting envy.  And how you handle envy, slander, bickering, hatred, infighting will test the core of your ability to lead black people.  Our people break down all their leaders.  Yes, we have.  But so far, I've been at this fifty-five years, and ain't no ways tired because you cannot break down love.  When you genuinely love, you can suffer from the lips, from the pins, from the hearts of a people that are difficult to lead.  And I'm saying that to say this, there was so much envy of Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] by my fellow ministers.  One day I decided, I'm gonna fight them.
Speaker 2: This is '74 [1974]?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Story_ID: 633877
Speaker 1: I go to Chicago [Illinois] because they used to mock me, you know (shakes head).  A young sister jumped off a roof eight stories high to the concrete.  They called me.  I ran to her side.  When she got in the ambulance, I was in the ambulance with her.  The man tried to open her blouse to put a stethoscope, but in her condition when a hand went to her blouse that was not her hand, she wouldn't allow that man to open her blouse.  When she got to the hospital, they wanted to bore a hole in her head because the pressure had built up inside her brain.  Her mother came to me--now, I had already prayed for the young lady, my sister.  And the mother said, "They're about, they want to put this--bore a hole in her head."  I said--she said, "What should I do?"  I said, "Give me a minute."  And I prayed, and I went back to her.  I said, "Tell them, leave her head alone."  Within a few days, this child walked out of that hospital.  She had knee, knee surgery and ankle surgery.  She's alive today.  The minister would lay hands on people--this is truth, man, and some of the followers of Elijah Muhammad said, "You know, that Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], he's crazy.  He's there, trying to heal people."  I wasn't trying.  I just prayed for them.  And they would get healed.  This is the honest to God truth.  So we bought a warehouse building.  I filled the warehouse, by the grace of God, with 150,000 pounds of beans I had, number ten cans of peas, rice--we bought a whole boxcar of rice.  "What are you doing, Farrakhan?"  I'm doing something so that when people are hungry and don't have anything, they can go to their warehouse and get it.  So the people in Chicago said, "He's trying to compete with Elijah Muhammad."  I'm trying to follow him.  So when we had seventy thousand people at Randall's Island [Randall's Island Park, New York, New York], some of the lieutenants from Chicago had come into the city.  So they were at the restaurant having something to eat, and I went and I sat with them for a minute.  The supreme captain of the Nation [Nation of Islam] had said, "You know, Farrakhan is an actor."  So I told the first officer who was there, I said, "Go back and tell him, if I'm an actor, and God blesses me with this success and he's a believer and can't do what an actor does, then it's something wrong with his belief."  I said, "Go back and tell him that."  Now, I'm in a position where the envy that's inside the Nation, that Malcolm [Malcolm X] experienced, I'm experiencing it now.  But it broke Brother Malcolm, see.  And he began to think that his teacher was jealous of him.
Story_ID: 633878
Speaker 1: Now, I go to Chicago [Illinois] now to fight.  I'm at his table, and around him are members of his family and some of the ministers.  And I know they're envious.  And so I raised the question at the table.  And Elijah Muhammad hits the table (gesture).  And he said, "Seek refuge in Allah from the envier when he envies" [Al-Falaq 113:1 - 5].  And he got up.  And he walked out of the room.  I'm sitting there with these envious people, man, daggers flying everywhere, and I got some too.  But what they don't know about me, and the world will soon find out, see, I was born as a warrior for this time period.  That's why Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] don't punk out in front of the enemy.  I'm not afraid of them.  If God is for you, who can be against you and when?  Our leaders are weak because they bow to an enemy, see, because they claim God, but they don't have enough faith in God to speak truth to power, see.  So I wanna close this point, and then we can go on.  Elijah Muhammad comes back in the room, and he looks at me.  I'm sitting at the other head of the table.  He's sitting at the head.  And he said, "Brother, whenever you have a piece of board that you're gonna put in the corner of the building to uphold the weight of the building, you have to put a lot of pressure on that board.  And if it breaks, then you know it's not the board you were looking for.  You throw it away and get you another one."  Now, I want you to think about a master teacher--I'm talking about Elijah Muhammad.  Malcolm X was groomed in the media and among us to be the heir apparent of Elijah Muhammad.  You don't sit in that seat and can't take a lot of the evil and ugliness, not only of your people, but of a government that hates to see our rise.
Story_ID: 633879
Speaker 1: So Elijah Muhammad--you know anything about martial arts?
Speaker 2: Some.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, you know when you go to a master teacher in the dojo, they inflict pain on you and then you've gotta tap out and then they ease up.  But every time you go, they try to bring you over the threshold of pain to create a new threshold of pain.  Now, I want you to think about what I'm saying because you just can't be an articulate person and become a great leader of black people.  You've got to be able to suffer the slings, the arrows, the envy, the jealousy, the hatred of a government and stand.  And if you can't, (gesture).  So he's making a stone to be in the corner of a building that had to be strong enough to support the weight of the building.  Malcolm [Malcolm X] broke under that pressure.  And not only did he break, he attacked his teacher and benefactor.  Malcolm is gone, but history has recorded him as one of the great helpers of Elijah Muhammad, but again, a great helper of the rise of our people.  Well, now, here's Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  I'm sitting in his--in the seat now, of Malcolm first, as the head of the New York mosque [Mosque No. 7, New York, New York]; envy flying everywhere.  Now, I'm ready to fight the envier, but Elijah Muhammad said, "Seek refuge in God from the envier when he envies" [Al-Falaq 113:1 - 5]. Then he tells me that, "I'm trying to make you able to sit in my seat.  And I've got to put pressure on you to see what's in you before I leave so that when I'm gone, I'll know that you'll be able to take what the government and all your enemies will give you."  So he prepared me, took me to thresholds of pain.  Now, he's gone, '75 [1975], and all my trials, great trials begin because now, the Nation [Nation of Islam] that he built is gone.  If you look at all the mosques that we built under his father, when the son [Wallace D. Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed] took over, the lovers of the father were gone.  And every mosque that they have was our mosque that we built with our money.  They haven't built nothing that they've got today hardly that didn't come from the followers of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  Now, we got nothing.  And I'm starting in 1977, I have an epiphany, and I start to rebuild the work of Elijah Muhammad (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 633880
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'll do my best to be obedient (laughter).
Speaker 2: You were doing very well before. Because I really wanna understand, you know, 'cause we have to put this in historical context, you know, and I wanna go from '65 [1965] to '70 [1970], you know, there's a lot of turbulent time.  You were talking about Muhammad Ali and, you know, during that time.  But I want you to talk about the Nation [Nation of Islam], you know, what--because, you know, the cities are burning up.  You know, there's a lot of social unrest.  Can you tell us the Nation's role during that time?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: You know, you have the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party], I mean, so can you just sort of talk about--and I'm really interested in '65 [1965] to '70 [1970] because there's--
Speaker 1: Okay, let's try to sum it up quickly.  Because the Civil Rights Movement was really at its height.  Before Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] left the Nation, he went to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad because we in the streets were selling the Muhammad Speaks newspapers [Muslim Journal].  The brothers and sisters were on the Freedom Rides, and they were actively integrating lunch counters and hotels and other places.  And Brother Malcolm went to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and he said, "Well, look, you know, they're out in the street.  They are," talking about the Civil Rights Movement, "and they're challenging, you know, the authority, the unjust laws, the this and the that, and the FOI [Fruit of Islam] is only out there selling newspapers.  Can we get out there and do this?"  And Elijah Muhammad said to Brother Malcolm, "Hold your position."  He said, "They don't have no place to go but to where you stand, so you stand and hold your position."  Right now, here we are, this is 2010.  You got your first black president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama].  I'm--I'll get back to that.  My point is, look at your condition.  You ain't got no place to go.  You're a big Negro president, secretary of this and secretary of that, but what do you have for the masses of your people.  You got nothing.  You gonna have to come back and see what is the future of black people in America's social, economic, political and religious system?  You don't have any.  So let's get back to '65 [1965] and '70 [1970]. Man, you all got me started here.  "You got nothing.  Hold your position, Malcolm.  Don't get swayed by that.  That's temporary."  So all we did was integrate lunch counters, hotels, motels so that the economic strength of black people could be siphoned off by white people.  So right now, all the businesses that we had in the South, they're gone just about.
Story_ID: 633881
Speaker 1: Okay, but let's go back.  I want, s- that, that time period, what is the Nation [Nation of Islam] doing (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Nation now is trying to show black people why you've got to go back to the earth and farm.  Right now what--
Speaker 1: So that's why you were acquiring farms?
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not only farming.  We went international trade and commerce with China, with Algeria, with Peru.  We brought millions of pounds of fish into America, and we were going door to door selling black people fish at a time when we cut the price of the fish and broke the hold that the fish people had on the prices.  And they had to bring their fish down in order to compete with us.  What Elijah Muhammad was saying to us, look, he said, "The time is coming when these factories are gonna close, and you will not have any jobs.  You are like a grasshopper playing all during summer and the first blast of cold weather, the grasshopper is gone."  He says, "You've got to start now doing something for yourself."  And he was giving us an example of how we could pool our little nickels, dimes and dollars and go to the earth to farm.  Then from the farm, you'd raise your cotton, you'd turn your cotton into lint and your lint into cloth and you start making your own goods.  You've got sheep, you've got cows, you've got things that you can make shoes.  You can do something for yourself.  So now, what's the problem?  Years later we didn't pay attention to Elijah Muhammad's warnings.  The factories have closed.  Millions are unemployed, and I'm here to tell you for the record it's not gonna get any better.  So from '65 [1965] to '70 [1970] and beyond, Elijah Muhammad is developing us as an economic entity to show our people that if you do this, you can avoid a bad time that's coming in the future.
Speaker 1: So in 1972, that's when the Nation acquired Guaranty Trust or an interest in Guaranty Trust and Savings Bank [sic. Guaranty Bank and Trust Company, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, we owned--
Speaker 1: You owned it?
Speaker 2: We owned Guaranty Bank and Trust.  Elijah Muhammad, oh, what a man, what a man.  He wanted us to have a national black bank.  So he--I forget the brother's name who was his banker.  What's his name?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yes, Williams [ph.].  Thank you.  I don't remember his first name.  He was a wonderful little brother.  But when I talked to him, he said, "Man, I thought I knew banking, but Elijah Muhammad taught me more about banking than what I learned in school."  You had a man from God in your midst.  And I, oh, he built this place.  This house was once the property--not this house, but this land was once the property of one of the great preachers in this city.  His name, Reverend Rawls [Louis Rawls].  Reverend Rawls had a huge home right here.  Elijah Muhammad had the home next door.  Elijah Muhammad came out his door one day.  Reverend Rawls was outside.  He called him.  He said, "Would you like to sell your house?"  Reverend Rawls said, "Yes."  He said, "What price?"  Reverend Rawls gave him a price.  He excused himself, went upstairs and came down with a paper bag and gave it to Reverend Rawls.  That's how we got this land.  When he got that house, he tore it all down and built this one on that property.
Speaker 1: So what year was that?
Speaker 2: That's, oh god, he--he took it probably in 1970, '71 [1971], somewhere around there.  And I think he started--no '69 [1969], somewhere in there he bought the land.  And then he started building the homes across the street and this one.  He finished this one in late '73 [1973], something like that, I believe.  No, was it?  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, when did Muhammad Ali build his house or buy his house or--
Speaker 2: Muhammad Ali bought a house down the street (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The street.
Speaker 2: I, I don't remember the year, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's easy to, to get, but (simultaneous)---
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Story_ID: 633882
Speaker 1: My point is, when Elijah Muhammad told Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X], "Hold your position, they have no place to go except where you stand."  Now, as you look at the charter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], they were to deal with social issues, never economic issues.  So now everybody realizes that without money, economic development, your political gain is symbol without substance.  And so from there, 1965 to seventy--right up to '74 [1974], Elijah Muhammad was building the economic thing.  And I became his national representative and was on the radio teaching across the country every week for six years.  And he said to me, "You know, Brother Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], I want you to take care of the spiritual, while I'm working on the economic development."  So now, '75 [1975] comes and he departs from us.  Now, for the record, in 1972 during his 'Theology of Time' ['The Theology of Time: The Secret of Time,' Elijah Muhammad] lecture series at the new mosque [Muhammad Mosque No. 2; Mosque Maryam] on Stony Island [Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], before he got that mosque, I came to visit him.  He said, "Come on, get in the car, I wanna take you for a drive."  And he took me down to Stony Island, and he looked over at the building, and he said, "I'd love to hear you preach a sermon in that place."  I said, "Not me, dear apostle, you."  He said it again, and I said, "Not me, you."  At that time, our mosque was at 5335 South Greenwood [Avenue].  So I'm looking for him to preach a sermon in this beautiful mosque that he was purchasing.  And after I denied the second time, he said, "Well, who's the teacher?"  I said, "You."  And then he said, "I would love to hear you preach a sermon in that place."  Now, this is before we bought it.  We bought it, I think in '72 [1972].  Okay, now, he's teaching over there. (Gesture) This house is being built.  And he hears me in the audience bearing witness.  He said, "I hear my minister," and I was sitting to his right.  He said, "I want you to come down front.  I like to keep my eye on my minister."  And so the brothers that were on the front row of that particular seating arrangement moved a seat so I could sit down on the front row.  So when I sat down on the front row, he looked over at me and shook his head and pointed to his seat, which was on the altar.  And he just did this (gesture) three times.  Well, I had to come out and sit in his seat.  Well, I'm very nervous because I could feel the daggers (laughter), you know.  Our people are wonderful, even though we're ill, you know (laughter), but we're a wonderful people.  So they (laughter), he said to them at another time that he wanted them to listen to me, to look at me, to go where I tell them to do and to do what I ask them to do.  He was literally making me the leader of the Nation of Islam in his absence.
Story_ID: 633883
Speaker 1: You go and read about David and all of the sons that David had.  There was one that he got from Bathsheba.  And his name was Solomon, and while all the others were desirous of his seat, when it came time, he just asked Solomon to come and sit in his seat.  And that was to say so many things without saying, you just sit the man.  Well, the family had another view.  And I did too. I have to admit that I didn't feel qualified, if Elijah Muhammad were dead, to lead the Nation.  I really didn't feel qualified.  When Wallace and I were having a difficult time--
Speaker 2: Is this after the death of his father?
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: You had been--you came, you were brought back here, right?
Speaker 1: I came to Chicago [Illinois] the day it was announced that Elijah Muhammad was dead.  My son called me in New York [New York] and told me that he was at the bedside of Elijah Muhammad in the hospital.  And I flew out here.  By the time I got here that evening, I was no longer the national representative.  Brother Jeremiah Shabazz of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] was given my position because myself and Wallace, we were at odds.  And I won't go into the details of that, but when I came to Chicago, my son--I mean my daughters [Donna Farrakhan Muhammad and Maria Farrakhan Muhammad] had just married into his family.  So my daughter was staying across the street in one of the homes, and when I came to Chicago, I had a suite in the hotel, but my daughter's brother-in-law, Sultan [Sultan Muhammad] at Saviours' Day the next day, he asked me, "Did I have bodyguards?"  I said, "No, I don't have any bodyguards."  He said, "These people are going a little crazy around here."  So he was kind of warning me because they were suspecting that I would challenge Wallace D. Muhammad [Warith Deen Mohammed] for the leadership of the Nation of Islam.  And as I said to you, honestly in my heart, I would not play with leadership of people if I didn't think--I thought that if Elijah Muhammad were alive, and he went away, I could hold his place in his absence until he returned.  But if he's dead, and I don't know what the next step is, I can't lead 'cause I just didn't feel that I knew what the next step was.
Story_ID: 633884
Speaker 1: I went over here to Stony Island [Avenue] and met with Wallace D. Muhammad [Warith Deen Mohammed], and I said to him, "Brother, I don't know what the next step is."  And he said, "But I do."  I said, "Then I will follow you, as I followed your father [Elijah Muhammad] as long as you are true to him."  We shook hands, and that day I went to the amphitheatre [International Amphitheatre, Chicago, Illinois] where they had Saviours' Day.  They wouldn't even let me in at first because there was, you know, a clash between the two of us.  And they didn't know that I and he had met and I had pledged to be with him as long as he was with his father.  And so when they finally let me in, they allowed me to speak.  And they were careful that if I had said anything out of place, I might not be here today.  Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] was there.  And as I was leaving the place that day, I was in a car, and Reverend Jackson was walking, and he shouted at me.  He said, "Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], don't you go start no stuff."  He didn't say, stuff, but you know, and I just looked at the brother.  I was not gonna fight Wallace D. Muhammad for the leadership.  I knew that I was in a strong position in terms of the love that the people had for me.  But if I didn't know what the next step was, why play with their lives and the destiny of the Nation.  So I tried my best, as God as my witness, to help Imam W.D. Muhammad and to follow him.
Story_ID: 633885
Speaker 1: But he began attacking his father, and I couldn't bear that.  And I was at the McCormick hotel [McCormick Inn, Chicago, Illinois], and my former captain, Yusuf Shah, was sent to me by the family to ask me, what did I want?  And I told him, "I just want you to leave Elijah Muhammad alone."  I said, "You're standing on the base that he laid.  If he was in error, you don't have to condemn him when all you have is from him.  Go take the Nation [Nation of Islam] where you think it should go, but don't condemn this great man who gave you, everything we got," we got it from Elijah Muhammad.  Within a few days, his picture was down off the walls.  And so I, I met with Wallace D. Muhammad right in this house.  And I would not speak to him with others around.  I asked for a private meeting because if I were critical of him, I didn't want others to hear that because respect for leadership is exactly what we were taught, and I would not wish to incite by my speech, anything against his leadership.  But I told him, you know, that he thought that I was being too harsh on white people and the government.  And I said, "But brother chief minister," (unclear), I said, "I think you're being too soft."  And I said, "They see the Nation as being wounded, and when a lion that has ruled a jungle is wounded, the person that wounded the lion was not gonna let the lion crawl off into the bushes and get strength.  They're coming in to destroy the lion."  These are my words to him.  And then later, I met a woman in California, may Allah grant her paradise, you know.  Brock Peters was my friend.  And I was lost.  I mean the Nation was going in another direction--
Speaker 2: You were living here at this point?
Speaker 1: I was living here, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who had taken over the New York mosque [Mosque No. 7, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: Jeremiah Shabazz.  But, you know, that history is not fully known because after Elijah Muhammad was gone, Yusuf Shah, who was my captain, was taken out of New York and sent to Dallas, Texas to be the minister.  My chief assistant which was Brother Akbar Muhammad, who was Larry 4X [Abdul Akbar Muhammad] then, was taken out of New York and sent to St. Louis [Missouri].  So one day Akbar called me.  He said, "Brother minister, why would you stay in New York when you see they're trying to destroy your good work?"  And so after he talked to me on the telephone, I came here to Chicago [Illinois].  And I asked Wallace D. Muhammad if I could come to Chicago to help him here.  They were planning to remove me anyway, so when I asked him could I come here to help him, he said, "Yes."  He said, "Well, what about your wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan]?"  I said, "Well, she'll follow me."  Before I could get back to New York, it was in The New York Times the next day, "Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] is gonna be moved to Chicago."  And so my journey then to Chicago under Imam Warith Deen Mohammed started.
Story_ID: 633886
Speaker 1: And when I went to California to meet with Brock Peters, because I was re--in fact, I was driving to California, and when I got to--I was driving by myself, and I followed Nat King Cole's Route 66 [U.S. Route 66].  And when I got to Flag- not Flag- just before Flagstaff, Arizona--Gallup, New Mexico, I stopped for the night.  And I called my wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan], and she said, "Brock Peters has been calling for you."  So I called Brock Peters, and when I called Brock, he said, the comedian, oh, man--had just died--Godfrey Cambridge had just passed away.  And he said, "His wife [Audriano Meyers Cambridge] wanted you, if you could say words at his funeral."  Well, I was in Gallup, New Mexico.  I said, "By tomorrow, I'll be in Los Angeles [California]."  My hair was a little longer.  I had a mustache, and so I said words at the funeral.  And I mean some of Hollywood's finest were there.  And the great brother, [HistoryMaker] Roscoe Lee Browne, did the eulogy.  And at the home of Brock and Dee Dee Peters after the funeral, James Baldwin was there, [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou and, oh, man, it--who's who was there.  And I was talking, and I said, you know, "I would like to do a movie on the life of Malcolm X.  And I wanna go overseas and ask them to help, you know, do this movie."  So James Baldwin says, "I wrote the script, Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]."  I said, "Well, I'm going to Egypt--," he was living in southern France.  And he said, "I'll come over to Egypt and talk with you, but I'll send you the script."  And he sends me the script, and it's in a little book called 'One Day When I Was Lost' [James Baldwin].  And I read the script, and Malcolm is in bed with this white woman in the script, and I said, "Oh god, I can't do this part."  So I'm gonna see (laughter) if he could rewrite this.
Story_ID: 633887
Speaker 1: Then Brock [Brock Peters] tells me, "There's a woman who sees.  She's a seer."  She said, "Do you know Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]?"  He said, "Yes."  Said, "Well, when you see him, tell him that they hate him because he's more the father's [Elijah Muhammad] son.  He'll know what I mean, and tell him, I wanna see him."  So when Brock tells me that, he takes me to this wonderful little woman.  Her name is Mrs. Gardner [ph.].  And she looked at me and told me that she sees me with a book around my neck and a man on my right and a man on my left.  She said to me that--she mentioned, "Two members of the family that hate you very much, one of them more than the other, and they will kill you."  And I was thinking about going into show business.  So she said, "Well, if you make that move, they'll leave you alone."  I said, "I got an invitation from Fidel Castro to visit Cuba and an invitation from Idi Amin to visit Uganda."  She said, "If I were you," this is '76 [1976], "I wouldn't travel right now 'cause it would be easier for you to be assassinated."  She said, "If you wait 'til next year, you'll be able to travel."  Then she looked at me and said, "But you're hard headed, you're gonna try to do it, but something will stop you."  And I left that woman that day.  I came back to Chicago [Illinois], and I met with Imam W.D. Muhammad [Wallace D. Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed] and told him about my invitation from Fidel Castro and Idi Amin, could I go?  And he gave me permission to go, but then it had to go before a board.  And when it went before the board, the board rejected it, so I couldn't go.  I was laughing to myself, I said, 'cause this woman sure had it right.  I was hard headed.  I did want to go, but something stopped me.
Story_ID: 633888
Speaker 1: I was put on the West Side [Chicago, Illinois] to teach, upstairs in a storefront in the back.  In a few weeks, it was full.  We moved further down to a ballroom.  In a few months, the ballroom was full.  What to do with Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]?  So Akbar [Larry 4X; Abdul Akbar Muhammad] tells Imam Wallace D. Muhammad [Warith Deen Mohammed] because he's now the special assistant.  He said, "Well, Farrakhan is from the Caribbean.  Maybe you could send him--his people are from the Caribbean.  Maybe if you send him down there, he would spread Islam there."  So they arranged a tour for me.  Well, that's like putting the rabbit in the briar patch.  And when I went in the Caribbean, I mean they came out by the thousands (laughter).  And by the time I got to Guyana in South America, I was in a mosque.  And they were introducing me, and they started speaking very negative of Elijah Muhammad.  And in that mosque, I threatened to whoop the imam, and I cussed, you know, I went back to my old days.  And I said, I'd, I'd, I'd tear his butt up.  And so someone was with me that was reporting my actions, and it got back to the imam, so they pulled me (laughter) out of the Caribbean.  So I was due to go to the Virgin Islands and that was cancelled.  But the point was, what to do with me?  So finally, I decided I would leave, and I met with the imam, and I told him, "60 percent of what you teach, I agree with.  But 40 percent of it, I don't agree with."  He said, "Well, teach the 60 percent that you agree with."  And he offered me five different mosques.  And I told him, "I'm afraid that if I teach the 60 percent that I agree with, some of the 40 percent that I disagree with will come out, and it will tend to confuse an already confused group of people.  I think that I would rather go back into show business."  I said, "I would like to do the life of Malcolm X to his transition to orthodox Islam and et cetera, et cetera.  I believe I could play his life because I've walked up in his shoes."  So he said, "Okay," but then he said, "but don't do anything that would discredit the Honorable Elijah Muhammad."  And I said, "I would never do that."  And I left.  And my journey now takes me to Egypt, then to Saudi Arabia, and finally I don't meet with Baldwin [James Baldwin].  He gets sick.  He can't come to Egypt.  I meet with Idi Amin, and Idi Amin, when he hears about my desire to do the movie on Malcolm X, he calls Muammar Gaddafi, and Gaddafi agrees to see me.  And so he flies me up to Tripoli [Libya].  And I missed the flight because Gaddafi is on his way out of Tripoli to Benghazi [Libya] or somewhere, celebrating the out- ousting of the British, I believe it was Benghazi.  But anyway, I missed the flight and missed Gaddafi.  So I go to Mecca [Saudi Arabia] and I speak with the scholars about raising money to do the movie.  And they downplayed it.  And while I was in Mecca, I decided, you know, that I would come back and rebuild the work of Elijah Muhammad.

Speaker 1: --Period of time that we're talking about, how are you feeling because it's almost like you're rudderless, that you have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Exactly.
Speaker 1: --no, no hold.
Speaker 2: I am rudderless.  I'm lost.  And that's why I talked about the book 'One Day When I Was Lost' [James Baldwin].  I didn't wanna preach anymore.  If what I was preaching from Elijah Muhammad was false, it wasn't true, and he was not the messenger of God, and God did not visit us, well, I'm lost then.
Speaker 1: Did you try to have discussions?  I mean why did Wallace--okay, imam, why did he go in that direction?
Speaker 2: He had always been in that direction.  He told his father [Elijah Muhammad] in 1967, "I never believed that that man in that picture was God."  And he was in constant conflict with his father over his father's preaching on Fard Muhammad [Wallace Fard Muhammad].  And so his father would put him out.  And then he would come back and his father would question him about his belief.  So he came back to the Nation [Nation of Islam] in October of 1974.  His father never asked him anymore about his thinking about Fard Muhammad and made him assistant at the mosque [Muhammad Mosque No.2; Mosque Maryam] on Stony Island [Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois].  So he was teaching now, under his father's tutelage.  So, you know, Imam Muhammad was, to me, a very brilliant, spiritual man Islamically, and I loved to hear him teach.  I admired some of what he did because he was building a bridge between the Nation of his father and the dominant Muslim world.  And I admired that.  And he was also building a bridge to the Christian community as well.  And I admired that.  The thing that hurt me most was he had a love, hate relationship with his dad.  And that had to come out when he was free to speak his heart and mind, and it did.  And some of us fell away from him, and others went on and followed him into what is called Islamic orthodoxy.  Quiet as it's kept, you know, he had great influence in my life as well, Wallace D. Muhammad [Warith Deen Mohammed].
Speaker 1: In what way?
Speaker 2: Well, when both of us were ministers of his father, we were very close as young ministers.  And he taught me the prayer in Arabic.  He taught me salat, meaning, the full way that we pray in the Islamic world.  And I wrote a play called 'Orgena' [Louis X], a Negro spelled backwards, and he helped me revise some of the language of the play that it would be more universally acceptable.  And we, we--well, it appeared that we had a great love and a great bond.  And even though we disagreed, every time I saw him, if it was on a plane and in the airport, I always greeted him with great love and respect.  And these that are around me, they never heard me speak a negative word against him in my private conversations and never in my national speaking.  He's the son of my spiritual father, and even if we disagreed, I would never voice that in the public.  I left all of that for him to do.
Story_ID: 633890
Speaker 1: Did you ever--were you, was, were you disappointed because it looks like blood was thicker than water in the decision that, about his (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was not disappointed in that sense because I didn't feel adequate.  If I had felt adequate, I would have challenged him.  If I had challenged him, there would have been bloodshed in the Nation [Nation of Islam].  So God protected me by making, allowing me to feel this sense of inadequacy so I would not challenge him for the leadership, even though his father sat me in the seat.  That was symbolic then because I did not feel adequate to lead.  So, no, I wasn't disappointed at that.  But what did disappoint me was the fact that my reputation had to be sullied.  People would come into New York [New York] and say very ugly things, that the minister had stolen the money.  He had done this, he had done that, and it was destroying a good reputation, an honest reputation that God had blessed me to build.  And the strange thing, when Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] was being inaugurated in Washington [D.C.], I was there.  And the brother that wrote the book 'Roots' ['Roots: The Saga of an American Family']--
Speaker 1: Alex Haley.
Speaker 2: --Alex Haley, was also there pushing the book 'Roots.'  And there I was in this little hotel, and Brother Akbar [Larry 4X; Abdul Akbar Muhammad] who was my chief assistant in New York [Mosque No. 7, New York, New York], visited me in that hotel.  And he said to me, I'm not gonna quote it perfect, but this the general thing, that the imam said, or it was said that, "I had to be taken down in order for the imam leadership to be established."  And that hurt me because if you feel that you have a divine commission, why should another human being have to be destroyed in order for your leadership to be established?  That--I was disappointed then.  And to be very honest, I was disappointed and embittered.  And I became so bitter, so bitter.  My phone never rang anymore.  It was as though, because I wasn't in a position any more, I could see how people gravitate towards you when they think you've got something to give them.  But when you don't have nothing, you're still the same person with the same skill or wisdom, but you're not in any high position of authority.  So they, they spit on you.  They--that disappointed me.
Story_ID: 633891
Speaker 1: I remember once I'm driving in the car, I'm not driving, I'm in a car.  And boy, was I cussing.  Oh, my goodness.  The worse cussing sailor would have looked like a choir boy.  And I was cussing so hard 'til I could almost taste the bitterness of bile coming out of me.  And I asked myself this question afterwards.  I said, well, why are you so bitter?  Were you really working for God or were you working for the praise of men?  And when they don't praise you or recognize you anymore, you're disappointed, you're bitter.  See, I challenged myself.  I examined myself, my own motivation.  And I said, well, some of what I was doing was for God, but some of what I was doing was also ego, gratification.  And when I was living on Damen [Damen Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], I heard my son upstairs playing one of my old tapes.  And as I heard myself, I shouted up to the room, "Turn that N word off; he's too damned arrogant."  The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that I was a very humble person.  But I had to grow to that.  And all these changes that I was going through, this is why in my memoirs, I thank God for Imam W.D. Muhammad [Wallace D. Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed] because the things that he did to me was, he was doing it for me, because all that I went through made me realize, man, that you got to purify your motives.  You either work for God fully or you don't, but you can't have ego gratification as any motive for anything that you do in the name of God.
Speaker 2: But you broke off, though, you broke off, you broke off--
Speaker 1: From?
Speaker 2: From his, from the--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Story_ID: 633892
Speaker 1: So what happens at that point?  So you, you talk to, you actually, the woman in California (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and I spoke to him.
Speaker 1: --right, and to him.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, what does he say when, you know, when you--what happens at that conversation?
Speaker 2: Well, he just said he wished me well 'cause I wasn't preaching.  I was going back to show business.  That's all I knew before I started preaching.  So just like the woman said, "If you say, you're going back into show business, they'll leave you alone."  And they did.  I mean I'm not a threat anymore.  I'm not a challenge anymore.  But when I left Mecca [Saudi Arabia] and came back and decided to rebuild the work of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, well, then, I had to make an announcement of such.  And when I did that, of course, then all of the forces, you know, that would come against me, did.
Speaker 1: That's 1978?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Nineteen--
Speaker 2: That's 1977.
Speaker 1: Seven- 1977, okay.  And so what is your announcement that you make?
Speaker 2: That I'm going to attempt to rebuild the work of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
Speaker 1: So what were the forces that came after you?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, the imam [Wallace D. Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed] was in Mecca at the time, and when he heard that I was gonna rebuild, they came back home.  And a lot of ugly words were spoken concerning me.  And I, in trying to rebuild this work, I wanna name persons that were supportive and kept me alive.  There was [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti.  There was Jorja [HistoryMaker Jorja Palmer] and Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II].  There was the brother that wrote for the newspaper, a dear friend of our mayor, Harold Washington, Jarrett--
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Vernon Jarrett.
Speaker 2: Vernon Jarrett. There was Hannibal Afrik [Harold Charles; Baba Hannibal Afrik].  There was some of the nationalist community that came around me.  There was no FOI [Fruit of Islam] then 'cause I was literally just getting started, but Haki and then the Hebrew Israelites, Asiel Ben Israel [Prince Asiel Ben Israel], El Kanan, Nasee Amishadia [ph.], they were support for me.  And Vernon Jarrett, may God be pleased with my dear brother because a tape was put in his hands of something that was said at the mosque where my life was threatened.  And Vernon Jarrett wrote an article in, I think it's the Tribune [Chicago Tribune] that he wrote for.  And that article saved my life.
Story_ID: 633893
Speaker 1: And around me then was Sonji [Sonji Roi], the former wife of Muhammad Ali who had married Mr. Glover, the great attorney.  And I met in, what was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) [HistoryMaker] Reynaldo Glover.
Speaker 1: --Reynaldo Glover's home with Sonji, whom I knew way back when she married Ali.  And in Mr. Glover's house, oh, there was another great brother.  I can't call his name.  He's, he's a doctor in, I think in psychology or sociology, a great, a great Omega [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity].  And when he learned that I was desirous of becoming Omega and got blackballed, he was the one that brought me my Omega pin.  And in her house, Sonji and Reynaldo Glover is where I began talking about rebuilding the work of Elijah Muhammad.  And Reynaldo said words to me like, "Everybody has their price, Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]."  And he didn't trust the integrity of people.  He felt that everybody could be bought.  He was working for a law firm downtown.  The law firm--
Speaker 2: Isham, Lincoln and Beale [Chicago, Illinois], maybe.
Speaker 1: Isham, Lincoln and Beale, and the big man there was the former governor of the State of Illinois--what was his name?
Speaker 2: Thompson [Jim Thompson]?
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: Was it--
Speaker 1: No, not Thompson.
Speaker 2: Oh, it was, oh god, why can't I remember the name, Walker, it wasn't Dan Walker, no.  Was it--it only can be Walker, Thompson or--
Speaker 1: Before Walker.
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't know. Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: Well, anyway, he was, he was the governor of the State of Illinois.  And I think it was Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] who asked him if he would head up either the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] or something in his administration.  He refused, so he was a major partner in the law firm.  So Reynaldo, when they were fearing for my life, Reynaldo said, "You need to go and meet him."  Oh, I've got to get his name.
Speaker 2: Oh, that's okay. I've forgotten.
Speaker 1: Before Walker 'cause Thompson came after Walker.  The one before Walker.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) can look it up, I think, go on. I think we're going to look it up, go on.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, I met this former governor [Richard B. Ogilvie] in his office with Reynaldo, and he was giving me counsel.  And he said, "If you are to avoid assassination, you've got to stay in the public.  You've got to get out in the public and stay in the public."  That was his counsel to me.  I thanked him.  He was very gracious, he was very kind.
Story_ID: 633894
Speaker 1: And I came back, and I remembered something that Elijah Muhammad said.  He said, "Whenever you plant a seed in the earth, it sends a root down long before it sends a shoot up," and that root is what allows it to have the strength that when the shoot comes up, they may try to pluck it up, but it's root begin secure, it's difficult.  So I said, "No, I'm going underground.  I'm gonna do the very opposite."  And I refused to talk to the media.  I refused to do anything but move quietly.  And I went into cities throughout America, setting up study circles, myself and a brother named Jabril Muhammad.  His name was Bernard Cushmeer at the time and quietly.  In some cities, there may have been three or four study circles, but they never knew each other because if there was a disease in this cell, I didn't want it spread to the next.  And I went down into Mississippi, Mississippi, and I'm preaching by myself.  And there I am in Greenville, Mississippi as a guest of a brother that grew up in the church [St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church] that I grew up in in Boston [Massachusetts]--I'll get his name in a minute.  And he invited me to Greenville, and I spoke, and I spoke in his home and followers came right up to walk with me.  I went from Greenville to Greenwood [Mississippi] to Cleveland [Ohio] and everywhere I went, somebody heard this bold preaching and would come out of the woodwork and stand with me.  And I went to a little town in northern Mississippi where Rust College [Holly Springs, Mississippi] is.  Brother Sultan [Sultan Muhammad], I know you're sleepy, but what's the name of that--I know I wear everybody out.  I--
Speaker 2: No (laughter) that's okay.  Don't worry about it.
Speaker 1: But what was the name of the town where I met sister--our former director's, her brother?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Holly Springs.
Speaker 1: Holly Springs.  Thank you, brother.
Speaker 2: Holly Springs.
Speaker 1: Holly Springs, Mississippi.  And there I was.
Speaker 2: Was it Otto Kerner [Otto Kerner, Jr.], who was the governor?  No.
Speaker 1: Governor Kerner.
Speaker 2: Kerner, does that sound right?  No, I don't know.  Or Shapiro [Samuel H. Shapiro]?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Shapiro?  We had a Shapiro? I think there's--
Speaker 1: Kerner, no, it wasn't Kerner.
Speaker 2: No, okay, I don't know.
Speaker 1: But anyway, we'll find out.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But there I was in Holly Springs with a brilliant, strong black brother.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Skip Robinson [Alfred "Skip" Robinson].
Speaker 1: Skip Robinson, and in the room was an attorney, Lou Meyers [ph.].  And when I said I was gonna speak at Ole Miss--now, this is 1978, I'm speaking at Ole Miss, by myself, Lou Meyers took a .38 out and put it on the table, said, "You're not going to Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi] by yourself.  We're going with you."  And I went to Ole Miss and preached hard, like I do, and I mean black people come up out that audience.  They're ready to walk with Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  And I'm telling you, this is how it started.
Story_ID: 633895
Speaker 1: I came back to Chicago [Illinois], and while Elijah Muhammad was present, [HistoryMaker] Renault Robinson and his partner--oh, somebody gotta help me with these names.
Speaker 2: It's Renault Robinson and who?  Who else--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  [HistoryMaker] Howard Saffold.
Speaker 2: Howard Saffold (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Howard Saffold, okay, sure, sure, sure.
Speaker 2: Well, they were with the African American Patrolmen's League [Afro American Patrolmen's League; African American Police League], and Renault invited me to a national meeting that they were having at the McCormick [McCormick Place, Chicago, Illinois].  And I was the principal speaker.  And I spoke, and those black policemen from all over the country just fell in love in Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  So when I started to rebuild Elijah Muhammad's work, Renault and Howard Saffold, they called their brother policemen in other cities.  When I went into that city, the police would come out.  "We're with you Farrakhan."  I would go speak.  They were my security.  When I was in the Cincinnati [Ohio], they had bulletproof vests they wanted me to put on, bless their hearts.  I said, "I can't wear this kind of stuff."  It's like you're trying to put on the armor of Saul and David is in the house.  I don't need that stuff.  So the man, Ken Blackwell, who became the secretary of state, I believe, in Ohio--
Speaker 1: Columbus [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Columbus, yeah, well, he was a man in politics then, but on the low level.  But we communicated.  I went to Boston [Massachusetts], and that's my hometown, but when I went to Boston and the police would come.  They had these long overcoats, and under it was shotguns.  And when I had a room, they would put a room across from my room, and one upstairs above me, and they kept their door open through the night.  I wouldn't be here if it were not for the African American Patrolmen's League and Renault and Howard Saffold and all of the wonderful brothers and sisters around the country that protected my life because my life was in danger, you know.  But, you know, God is great, and now, of course, I have all these wonderful FOI [Fruit of Islam] around me, but those policemen protected my life as I began to rebuild the work of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.
Story_ID: 633896
Speaker 1: Along with [HistoryMaker] Father George Clements and Father Michael Pfleger, oh, did I have--let me tell you how I started.  Can I tell you?  Is you, is you (laughter) interested?  You is? (Laughter) You know, you're making me remember.  I guess you can see me coming to life just remembering.  But I thought since I was new in this city I should meet everyone that's a mover and shaker here and get their permission.  Lu Palmer [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II], oh god.  A blind person that has a seeing eye dog is a blessed person.  I'm in Chicago [Illinois].  I don't know Chicago.  Lu Palmer was my eyes and Jorja [HistoryMaker Jorja Palmer].  I wanted to go meet Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson].  Lu said, "Leave Reverend Jackson alone."  I have to tell the truth.  Evidently, he and Jesse at that point were not in good terms.  I went--listen to this, to Mr. Sengstacke [John H. Senstacke], I was up in his office, and I said, "Sir, I'm trying to rebuild the work Elijah Muhammad and I'm new in this city.  And I wanted to know if I could get your blessing to try to rebuild his work."  Mr. Sengstake not only gave me his blessings, but he allowed me to write a weekly column in the Crusader--
Speaker 2: Defender [Chicago Defender] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I went--in the Defender, sorry.  I went to Mr. John Johnson [HistoryMaker John H. Johnson].  I met him in his building, in his office, and I asked for his blessing.  He gave it to me.  I met with Father George Clements.  I got his blessing.  I tried to meet with Bishop Jackson [sic. Joseph H. Jackson], who as you recall, refigured the opening of his church [Olivet Baptist Church] so it wouldn't be on Martin Luther King Boulevard [sic. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive, Chicago, Illinois].  He refused to see me.  But I tried to meet with people that this city knew and loved to get their blessings.  I met with the great, the congressman, former track great--
Speaker 2: Metcalfe, no, Metcalfe?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Ralph Metcalfe.  And we went to the Black Hawk Restaurant downtown [Chicago, Illinois], and he said, "Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], do you vote?" I said, "No, I haven't voted."  He said, "I don't know why I'm talking to you, you know."  But he was so sweet.  He was so beautiful, and, you know, I don't know that anybody who was gonna do a work like this would go and seek the blessing of people in this great city.  And I got his blessing.
Story_ID: 633897
Speaker 1: And the man that used to interview Mr. Muhammad [Elijah Muhammad] on radio, oh--
Speaker 2: Oh, that's--
Speaker 1: He just passed away recently.
Speaker 2: Yeah. WV-, WVON [WVON Radio, Chicago, Illinois], you're talking about-oh-
Speaker 1: Let's see-I-that's a shame.
Speaker 2: I can't remember his name.  I'm sorry.  I should know his name.  We've interviewed him.  Do you know?  He owned it with [HistoryMaker] Pervis Spann.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): [HistoryMaker] Wesley South.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Wesley South.
Speaker 1: Wesley South, thank you, mum.  Wesley South.  And the blessings of these people, Lu [HistoryMaker Lutrelle "Lu" F. Palmer, II] and Jorja [HistoryMaker Jorja Palmer].  I got chills talking about them.  And I'm gonna take you in my office because Lu and Jorja were like mom and dad to a lost child who wants to do something so big that, I mean well, let's see if he can do it because I mean how could he rebuild Elijah's work.  You know, but they never discouraged me.  They encouraged me.  And I thank God for those names that I mentioned, and I'm sure there are others, Conrad Worrill [HistoryMaker Conrad Walter Worrill], other nationalists that were at Northeastern--
Speaker 2: -eastern University.
Speaker 1: --University [Northeastern Illinois University, Chicago, Illinois].  Oh god, historian.  Oh, Allah, forgive me.
Speaker 2: Was, was he at Northeastern?  Conrad, and there's, oh, no, it's not Tim Black [HistoryMaker Timuel Black].  It's--
Speaker 1: He's a nationalist, and educator.
Speaker 2: No, I know who it is, darn it. Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But anyway, these are people that when my history is written, their names have to be there because without their help, support and encouragement, I would not have been able to get through those dark early days when I had nothing.  And I wanna go to a point now when Elijah Muhammad, this furniture was brought in from Mexico, and I happened to be in the city, and I wheeled him into this house in a wheelchair, and members of his staff.  And we walked around this floor--
Speaker 2: It was Bob Starks [HistoryMaker Robert T. Starks].
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't Bob Starks.
Speaker 2: No, not Bob Starks, okay, sorry.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Anderson Thompson.
Speaker 2: Oh, Anderson Thompson.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's why they're here.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Anderson Thompson, thank you, brother.  Thank you so much.  You know, when you start getting up in age, and you haven't got there yet, you forget.  But I know somebody's gonna help me because when the history is written, their names have to be there because of what they mean to me now and what they meant to me then.
Story_ID: 633898
Speaker 1: People were very helpful at a time when you were just really starting out, and it wasn't.  Now, what, why did you--'cause that's 1978.  Now, 1979, how do you end up--what had happened with Muhammad Speaks, and you changed the name to The Final Call?
Speaker 2: (No audible response) (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay, so how did that happen?  Did the Muhammad Speaks stop being published for a while?
Speaker 2: Yes, you know, after the, brother imam, W.D. Muhammad [Wallace D. Muhammad; Warith Deen Mohammed] changed the name to Bilalian News, and then it got another name.  So the name died too.  But Elijah Muhammad, one day we were together at the table--not in this house, but in the house across the street.  And he, he's teaching, and I'm at the table.  And he said these words, he said, "If there were any symbol that I could use to represent my work, it would be a trumpet, for it's the trumpet that is used in the resurrection of the dead."  I don't know why he said it 'cause it was in the midst of another conversation.  Then he was talking some more, then he looks back at me and said, "And have the trumpet coming out of the corner of the page."  Then he says, "I want you to go like you see me go and do like you see me do."  Well, how did he start?  The first paper of the Nation of Islam was called The Final Call to Islam by Elijah Muhammad.  And so I just went right back over the ground.  And I called the paper The Final Call.  And on every issue, you'll see the trumpet coming out of the corner of the page.  I want you to know, my dear, sister, that there's hardly anything that I've done in these thirty-three years that he was not directing from words that he spoke to me.  He was actually preparing me, but I was ignorant to the level of my preparation to do what I'm doing right now.
Story_ID: 633899
Speaker 1: Imam W.D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] had a work to do that I was not to interfere with.  If I had interfered with it, I would have been killed because he had to introduce the broader realm of Islam to black America.  That was part of his assignment, and I think by the grace of God, he did what he was to do, and may Allah be pleased with him.  And I can genuinely tell you of my love for him, more than could be expressed.  And that's why whenever I saw him, I would embrace him.  And we had kind words.  I mean two weeks before he passed away, his brother, Jabir Herbert Muhammad, had his janazah prayer at the mosque over here on 47th Street [Masjid Al-Faatir, Chicago, Illinois].  And I was there, and I heard that Imam W.D. Mohammed had just come in and was seated in another section of the, outside where they had the service.  And I got up from where I was, and I went over to him.  And he was sitting, and he wanted to get up.  I said, "No, no, no, don't get up, brother imam," and I kneeled down.  I kissed him on his cheek, and I said, "Brother, I love you."  He said, "Minister [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], I love you, too."  And that was the last time I saw him alive.  And when I went to his--we call it in our culture, a funeral service, but in Islam, it's called the janazah because that's the prayer that is said at the burial of the dead.  And I was very, very, very, very, very sad because my hope was always that he and I would eventually come together for the cause of Islam in America.  That still will be.  It won't be with him personally, but I believe the two communities ultimately will become one by the grace of God.
Story_ID: 633900
Speaker 1: So you're, you're, you, so you start The Final Call.  Now, is Saviours' Day, is he holding Saviours' Day or he does--that's what I'm trying to--
Speaker 2: He started holding Saviours' Days in the last two or three years of his time among us.  I'm talking about W.D. Mohammed [Wadith Deen Mohammed].  And he would hold it in Detroit [Michigan].  We came together at Saviours' Day 2000 at the United Center [Chicago, Illinois].  And I asked him, he had dinner with me at the (unclear), and I asked him if he would share that day with me, and I would give him equal time to speak.  And he said, "No, I'll come and I will speak.  But it's your day."
Speaker 1: Okay, but that twenty years, but you started--so you both were doing Saviours' Days?  No?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: In the end, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when he--
Speaker 1: But you were separate or was he doing them at all?  I mean I'm just saying (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, he was not doing Saviours' Days at all.
Speaker 1: He was doing them.  But you started in 1981 doing Saviours' Days?
Speaker 2: That's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. How strong is your following at this point, you know, in the early '80s [1980s]?
Speaker 2: Well, I'll say it like this.  The believers didn't know where the rest of the believers were because, as I told you, we were setting up study cells.  And in 1981 at the Auditorium Theatre [Chicago, Illinois], I said we would have our first Saviours' Day.  The Auditorium Theatre holds approximately forty-two hundred people.  We did not fill it, but it was close.  I would say we were about five hundred short of filling it.  That was our first Saviours' Day.  And I think about three thousand or more followers came to that Saviours' Day.  The next Saviours' Day we had it, '82 [1982] at the Hilton [Conrad Hilton Hotel; Hilton Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  And we filled both the Grand Ballroom and the main ballroom, over five thousand, six thousand people there then.  We're growing now.  The next year with '83 [1983], we had it in Gary [Indiana] at the Genesis Center [Genesis Convention Center].  We had about six thousand or seven thousand then.  And the next year was '84 [1984], we had it at the armory where the messenger had his last Saviours' Day, and it was packed to overflowing, about fifteen thousand, sixteen thousand people.  Kwame Ture [Stokely Carmichael] came.  He said, "Well, Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], you said you would rebuild it, and here it is."  And, of course, from '84 [1984] and '85 [1985], we did the Power At Last Forever, I think it was '85 [1985], right, at the Richard L. Jones Armory [General Richard L. Jones Armory, Chicago, Illinois], '85 [1985], that was February.  By '85 [1985], October, we were at Madison Square Garden [New York, New York] and fifty thousand people came out.  And only twenty-six thousand or twenty-seven thousand could get into the main arena and a smaller arena that held six thousand.  We packed it all.  And now people were paying to get in because the money, I mean it was too much money to put out.  And I was offered millions from the Arab and Muslim world to not preach Elijah Muhammad or Wallace Muhammad but preach Prophet Muhammad, and although I loved Prophet Muhammad, it would be improper for me to use Elijah Muhammad's teaching and not give him credit.  So that's '85 [1985].

Speaker 1: When does the Fruit of Islam start?  When does that start?
Speaker 2: Well, of course, it was started with Elijah Muhammad (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) With Elijah Muhammad.
Speaker 2: But with me, when I first got started, there was a brother, his name is Ibrahim Muhammad.  He was an assistant to me in the beginning.  We started the FOI in the cellar of his house, not in the basement, but in the cellar.  And, and, you know, there was a brother who passed away recently, used to be on the radio a lot.  And he had a place on--it may have been 47th Street, going toward the West Side [Chicago, Illinois], Sadiq, Wally Sadiq [ph.].  Have you heard of Wally Sadiq?
Speaker 1: I don't know if I've heard of him.
Speaker 2: Wally Sadiq. Thank you, Allah, for allowing me to remember his name.  He allowed us to have FOI in his place, and we used to hold our meetings at the, the law center on Drexel [Boulevard], Charles Knox.  Have you heard of him?  Well, Charles Knox was like our landlord.  He opened his doors to us.  There was Reverend Al Sampson [HistoryMaker Reverend Albert Richard Sampson] opened the door of his church, and there was another reverend, oh god--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Porter.
Speaker 2: Reverend Porter [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Kwame John R. Porter] that opened the doors of his church.  So I can't take any credit.  God made friends for me.  And these wonderful people opened doors that allowed me to grow from their houses of worship.  So how could I ever be against my Christian family when it was they who opened their doors.  Al Sampson was the first and [HistoryMaker] Father George Clements, now these--Father Pfleger [Michael Pfleger].  Now, these are wonderful, wonderful, wonderful people.  And I can't thank God enough for the inspiration that they have given me.  Harold Washington had breakfast with me at 9415 South Damen [Avenue] when he was running to be mayor.  And I pledged my support to him.
Story_ID: 633902
Speaker 1: I got in a fight with the Jewish community.
Speaker 2: Over the election, right of--
Speaker 1: Over Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Jackson.
Speaker 1: And it happened accidently, you know.  At the twentieth anniversary of the March on Washington, I spoke.  Reverend Jackson spoke, and Reverend Jackson was speaking at a church that night.  And I went to hear my brother.  Reverend Jackson is some kind of preacher, boy, that brother can preach.  And he's one of the most brilliant men that I have met in my life.  He asked me after he preached that night, he said, "I'm thinking about running for the presidency of the United States.  Would you help me?"  And I told him I would have to talk it over with the believers, which I did.  And my council group of elders, they said that they thought I should.  We raised twenty-five thousand, gave it to Reverend Jackson, and while we were saying, "Run, Jesse, run," some members of the Jewish community were taking out ads saying, "Ruin, Jesse, ruin."  And through Reverend Jackson, I thank God for that brother because my standing with Reverend Jackson, he opened doors for me with the Christian church that I could never have opened on my own.  I was like a surrogate speaker, but I don't know nothing about politics.  I'm trying to be nice and bless his heart, Jesse went with me down to the--what's the office downtown where you sign up as a Democratic to vote.
Speaker 2: Right, Board of Elections [Board of Election Commissioners for the City of Chicago].
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, Jesse got me into that.  Jesse, bless his heart, I wasn't speaking to the press.  "When are you gonna speak to the press?"  I said, "I'm pregnant."  He said, "What do you mean, you're pregnant?"  I said, "Something is growing and I can't speak until, in other words, it's born."  But I didn't tell them that.  I just told them I was pregnant.  And I'm sure they didn't know how to deal (laughter) with that answer.  But Reverend Jackson, bless his heart.  He told me, "You've got to speak to the press, Minister [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan]."  I was seven years underground, from '77 [1977] to '84 [1984].  And that's when I broke my silence on Jesse's campaign, and Jesse is the one--I don't wanna sound common, Reverend Jackson is the one that asked me to talk to the press.  And from there, it's history.  You got it, you got it all (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 633903
Speaker 1: Those were the days of Hymietown and, you know, better religion, and, you know, and so--but I wanna ask you a question.  How was this support base different from that?  Were you, in the little cells that you were meeting with around the country that grew, is this, are these the same followers of Elijah Muhammad?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Who are these followers?  Can you talk about that?
Speaker 2: Some were with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad, but most of these were brand new people that were attracted to me in my going around the country preaching.  And I never put anyone in authority over them.  I called it a study cell.  And we resurrected the books of Elijah Muhammad, 'Message to the Blackman' ['Message to the Blackman in America,' Elijah Muhammad], 'How to Eat to Live' [Elijah Muhammad], 'Fall of America' ['The Fall of America,' Elijah Muhammad].  So I had them studying a word with a study group facilitator.  And it caused them to just grow and grow and grow, and then some said, "Well, you know, the minister [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] is doing something really different.  Elijah Muhammad didn't have any study groups.  He had temples."  And so they all wanted temple.  But when you set up a mosque, somebody has to be in authority.  And that's when trouble begins, when you put a Negro in authority who couldn't call a dog, and the dog answer, now he's got authority to talk to people.  And then they start abusing people.  So we grew fast.  And by '85 [1985], I started my world tours.  And, of course, ten years later, the Million Man March.
Speaker 1: When did the restaurant [Salaam Restaurant and Bakery, Chicago, Illinois] open?  You, you opened the restaurant?
Speaker 2: Ninety-five [1995].
Speaker 1: Ninety--okay, that's later, okay.
Story_ID: 633904
Speaker 1: But the POWER--let's talk about POWER a little bit 'cause you were pushing this major economic revival, you know--
Speaker 2: There were two brothers out of Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], one, may God rest his soul, a very beautiful brother that was shot to death by the sniper that turned out to be John Muhammad [John Allen Muhammad].  This brother was somewhere in Virginia and he went to a gas station and was shot down.  I cannot remember--Ken, oh, what's the name of the two brothers that brought POWER to me?  Ken--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Bridges.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's right Bridges.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Al Wellington and--
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Who was it?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICES):  Al Wellington--
Speaker 1: Al Wellington and Ken Bridges [Kenneth Bridges].
Speaker 2: And Ken Bridges.
Speaker 1: Now, they brought to me the concept of POWER, People Organized and Working for Economic Rebirth.  And we loved the theme.  It was in harmony with the teachings of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  Al Wellington and Ken Bridges were two very, very brilliant brothers in the field of economic development.  And so, they pretty much guided the POWER tours, the PR [public relations] work and all of that that went into that.  And through POWER, I mean we were able to go to Libya and get a loan of $5 million to start a product line called Clean 'n Fresh.  And we went to Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker George Johnson] of Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company], and he agreed to help chemically put together a product line, and we came up with the name Clean 'n Fresh.  I believe it was Brother Leonard [Leonard Muhammad] or someone came up with the name Clean 'n Fresh, I don't remember who.  But Mr. Johnson was gonna do it. Gaddafi [Muammar Gaddafi] sent the money, wired $5 million into the bank, Independence Bank [Independence Bank of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois].  At the time, Mr. Shealey [Richard W. Shealey] was the president of the bank, and Mr. Johnson was the chairman of the board.  We put the money in a black bank.  That's what we teach, at a less interest rate than I would have gotten at a white bank, but that's what I teach, so we followed through.  Mr. Johnson, a good hearted man, had just given a million dollars to Reverend Schuller [Robert H. Schuller] when he built that great Crystal Cathedral [Garden Grove, California].  Mr. Johnson gave him a million dollars.  But when members of the Jewish community found out that he was building or gonna help us, they threatened him that they would take all his products off the shelf if he did anything for Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] 'cause they were masters of the distribution chain.  And it hurt me that Mr. Johnson called me and said, "Brother Farrakhan, I just can't do it.  I would like to, but I can't.  They threatened me to take all my products off the shelf."  And I think I called Reverend Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] and others.  "Well, why don't we circle the wagons around, brother?"  But standing up to the Jewish community and their power and influence is a little bit much for Negroes.  It's even difficult for black people, you know.  So poor brother, I mean after he turned me down to make the product, Mr. Johnson came to The Final Call building and asked me to take the money out of the bank.  Can you believe that?  So that taught me that giants in the eyes of black people are midgets in the eyes of white people.
Story_ID: 633905
Speaker 1: And mister--my protocol director at the time was Sister Claudette [Claudette Marie Muhammad].  And Claudette used to be a model for Mr. Johnson [HistoryMaker George Johnson] of Johnson Products [Johnson Products Company].  And she said when she went to talk to Mr. Johnson--because they knew each other quite well, according to Claudette, Johnson--Muhammad, she said, Mr. Johnson said, he wished that he was as free as Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  And I thought to myself, a man that at that time was grossing over $150 million a year is not free.  Don King, who just recently buried his wife, Henrietta [Henrietta King], sat at that table with me and told me how HBO [Home Box Office] brought him into their office, Time Warner [Time Warner, Inc.], and told him that he was a gnat, and they were an elephant, and they would crush him.  You don't hear too much about Don King now because the kingmakers, when they turn down on you, they break you.  A young lady who I knew at fifteen or sixteen, Stephanie Mills, when she was in the play 'The Wiz' in New York [New York], she was doing a gospel thing here in Chicago [Illinois] at the theater downtown.  And I went to see her.  And after the show, she said, "I'm going over to Oprah's restaurant [The Eccentric, Chicago, Illinois].  There's an after party.  Would you be my guest?"  And I said, "Sure."  And I put her in our limousine, and we took her there at Oprah's restaurant.  I don't know whether she still has it, but there was a line of people that were greeting Ms. Winfrey [Oprah Winfrey], and I was in the line.  And when I went to greet Oprah, she said, "Oh, Farrakhan," she said, "I've been here eight years and this is the first time I've had a chance to meet you."  Now, she's been here twenty-five years now.  See, but Farrakhan is unworthy to be on her show.  And I understand.  But I'm a man that's rejected by many of my own people out of fear of what whites will say about any association with the so called anti-white, anti-Semitic, anti-American Farrakhan.
Story_ID: 633906
Speaker 1: So for me to sit in the seat of Elijah Muhammad, I had to be able to withstand rejection and humiliation in terms, not that my spirit is humiliated, but to call me all of these names and turn people against me, you know.  If I were a weaker man, I would have collapsed under the pressure that they have put on me.  Here we are, Muslims.  We go into projects in Washington [D.C.], clean up the drugs and allow women and children to play again where they live.  Then the government gives contracts, not to me, but to Muslims, under HUD [U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development].  And the Muslims start cleaning up projects in Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], in Chicago [Illinois], in L.A. [Los Angeles, California], and women are able to come and bring their babies and come out.  And Peter King [Peter T. King], the congressman of New York [New York], prevails upon the government to rescind all these contracts under the pushing of the ADL [Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith; Anti Defamation League].  So we know sanctions because we've been sanctioned, you know.  But as I tell them, you know, in order to cut off my blessings, you would have to have a ladder that reached to heaven, and I don't think you have one that goes that high.  So here we are, the Nation of Islam, we get no help from no quarter, but God still blesses us to continue to function.  And we have--they have inserted enemies inside the Nation to do tremendous damage to us, but we function.  We set that restaurant up in 1995.  We built that with concrete and steel, not no cheap material.  And I called it the palace of the people.  We spent thousands and thousands of dollars paying people that said they had the ability to manage, to cook, to this and that.  And they stole, oh my god, the sabotage that was going on.  We were trying to keep it open, keep it open.  Finally, we had to close it because it was sucking the life out of the Nation, and hopefully, this next year, early next year, Saviours' Day, we'll open the Salaam [Salaam Restaurant and Bakery, Chicago, Illinois] again.
Story_ID: 633907
Speaker 1: Let me ask you this.  In this whole thing--yeah, okay, the whole thing with the ADL [Anti Defamation League of B'nai B'rith; Anti Defamation League] and the Jewish community, were there pressure--did you feel any pressure to--at that point in time we're talking about, really, there's a ten year period from '85 [1985] to '95 [1995], to reach out to them or to sort of kowtow to them or, you know, 'cause that's a lot of pressure on you in some respects since we're talking about--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, no, no.  No, the pressure came from within me to wanna see if dialogue could be had between us to put a stop to the controversy.  So even during the Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson] campaign, we contacted the head of the ADL.  I'm trying to remember his name.  We called his office.  He was in Italy, and I said, "I'd like to have a meeting with him."  They said, "Well, he's out of the country, so when he comes back, you can try again."  So he comes back from Italy and I put in a call.  His name--do you remember his name?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Rabbi Shulman?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: The head of the ADL, I--
Speaker 2: The head of the ADL.
Speaker 1: I don't know who it was.
Speaker 2: But anyway, we'll get his name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When I talked to him on the phone, he says, "I would love to talk to you, Mr. Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], but not until your rhetoric cools down."  So he rejected my call for a dialogue.  At another point, I'm thinking it was Ted Koppel who wanted to have a dialogue on his show ['Nightline'] on television.  I said, "No."  I said, "That's not the proper place for a dialogue.  I'd rather have a dialogue in private and when we come to agreement, then we come on your show, Mr. Koppel."  That wasn't satisfactory.  I don't know how many times, but there are those around me who could help me to name or number the times that I have reached out to them for a dialogue.
Story_ID: 633908
Speaker 1: Then, of course, Rabbi Shulman and Rabbi--oh, boy, I can't think of the man's--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 1: No, no, no.  Rabbi Shulman came here with another rabbi, and we had dinner together.  And the rabbi that was with Rabbi Shulman said, "Would you speak at a Jewish synagogue?"  I said, "Tomorrow if you could arrange it."  Then he asked me if I would--no, if--no, first, "Would you speak before the board of rabbis?"  I said, "Yes, of course.  I'd be honored to do that."  They said, "Well what about visiting a Jewish synagogue?"  I said, "Tomorrow, if you could arrange it."  We were getting ready to dedicate the mosque [Muhammad Mosque No. 2; Mosque Maryam] on Stony Island [Stony Island Avenue, Chicago, Illinois], and I invited those two rabbis to be my guests.  They said, "If we came, it would send the wrong signal."  I said, "Well, you know, what risks are you willing to take for peace?"  I said, "We don't allow white people in the mosque so for me to allow you to come, I'm taking a risk.  What risks are you willing to take?"  All this is true.  Rabbi Shulman never came.  Rabbi Marx [Robert Marx] was the other rabbi's name.  And we agreed to disagree because Mr.--Rabbi Shulman told me, "It's not for me to criticize them.  It's for him to do that as a rabbi because he was the dean of the board of rabbis here."  So I gave him a parable that's in the Bible about Lazarus that said, there's a scripture, that Lazarus, you know, he went to the rich man, and the rich man gave him the crumbs from his table and sicced the dogs on him.  I said, "The rich man died and went to hell and Lazarus died and was seen in the bosom of Abraham.  And the rich man reached up from hell, crying out to Lazarus to bring some cool water and put it on his dry, parched tongue."  I said, "And Abraham wouldn't even let Lazarus speak."  He said, "There's a gulf between us.  He can't come to you, and you can't come to him."  So the man asked, the rich man asked Abraham, "Would you send Lazarus to my five brothers?"  He said, now, listen to the words of Abraham, "We sent you the prophets and you didn't listen to them.  What would make you listen to a man raised from the dead?"  I said, "You have had all the prophets--," this is me talking to a rabbi.  I said, "You have not heard them."  I said, "But you're looking at a black man that comes from a people that your people killed.  But I am one raised from the dead, maybe my language speaking to your people would be heavier than you speaking to them."
Story_ID: 633909
Speaker 1: So we parted. We had nice dinner together, and then they invited me, Rabbi Marx [Robert Marx], to his home for dinner.  I took my wife [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan], my son, my chief of staff, and we went--I can't remember.  It's off the Edens Expressway [William G. Edens Expressway] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably in Skokie [Illinois].
Speaker 1: --way out there.  And in that meeting was the writer, I think he wrote for the Tribune [Chicago Tribune], Kupcinet [Irv Kupcinet], Rabbi Marx, Rabbi Shulman, a few other rabbis and George O'Hara [ph.], you know, was there.  And we had a lovely meeting.  And then at the dinner table, Rabbi Marx pulls out an envelope out of his pocket, and he said, "Well, you know, we're--it's a love fest here, but tough love."  And he said, "There are conditions that we would ask of you if we are to have a friendship.  One, condition number one," he says, "we have to watch you and listen to you over a protracted period of time.  If your language changes and your, your speech and your actions, we'll consider.  Second, you put out this book 'Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews' ['The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews'] which we feel is a great calamity against the Jewish people.  We want you to stand up and denounce that book.  Third, nobody that has been unfriendly to the Jewish people have ever been spoken of well in history."  And he said, he talked about my brilliance and if I used my brilliance in a positive way from their vantage point, we could have friendship.  He said, "You have your truth and we have ours, you know."  He said, "Now, you can comment now or we'll go upstairs and have coffee and you can comment."  I said, "Well, let's go upstairs and have coffee."  And we went upstairs from where we were.
Story_ID: 633910
Speaker 1: And it was my time to comment.  I said, "In regards to your truth and my truth, there really is only truth.  What is yours and mine is perception of truth, and our perception of truth may differ, but it is the reconciliation of perception that produces agreement on truth."  I said, "From the Torah [sic.], it reads, 'Justice stands afar off and equity cannot enter because truth is fallen in the streets' [Isaiah 59:14].  We cannot heal the wounds between our people except we agree on truth.  That's first."  Then I said, "As far as watching me over a protracted period of time," I said, "your people have done more evil to my people than we have ever done to you and yours so perhaps we should be watching you over a protracted period of time, your words and your deeds before we would ever say that you are our friend.  And about the book, 'Secret Relationship' ['The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews'], I'll denounce it tomorrow because I would not want anything with my name on it that's false.  But since we only quoted Jewish scholars, Jewish historians and Jewish rabbis, then I'll denounce that book if you stand up and denounce every scholar, rabbi and historian that we quoted as liars.  And lastly, I wanna be your friend because that's why I'm here.  But if being your friend means I have to deny the truth, then yours is a friendship I don't need, and yours is a friendship that I don't want."  I said, "Now, you can come against me with all you have and you can incite the government to come against me."  I said, "But if I am with God and God is with me, and I'm standing on the truth, I will defeat you and the government."  And that's where we ended.  And I knew that the battle line then was set, and I can't remember the year that that happened (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Simultaneous) July of '93 [1993].
Speaker 1: July of '93 [1993], thank you.  And the war has been on since that time, spiritual warfare.
Speaker 2: Because that's the year you also, that's the year you also did the, the performance that was sort of, you know, right, in '93 [1993], the Mendelssohn [Felix Mendelssohn].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Was it in--yeah, '93 [1993] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, um-hm, um-hm.
Speaker 2: My sixtieth birth anniversary, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Story_ID: 633911
Speaker 1: Now, you had--you were diagnosed though with prostate cancer in '91 [1991], right?  That's what I have. And--
Speaker 2: Ninety-one [1991], yeah, yes, when I--
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And that's when (simultaneous)-
Speaker 2: right, fifty-eight.
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) also, Khalid [Khalid Abdul Muhammad] became your, your personal assistant?
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Khalid Muhammad?
Speaker 2: No, he'd been my assistant for a long--
Speaker 1: For a long time before that?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, back, I know you had met in, you know, 1970.  That's what it says.  But let's, let's go to the 1995, okay.  Two things happen in '95 [1995]--
Speaker 2: You need to ask me about Khalid Muhammad.  If you have anything there to ask of me about him?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I didn't have anything to--I mean he comes up later, but I don't really, I don't really have anything to ask.  I mean you could--go on, what do you wanna say?
Speaker 2: No, I just wanna say that he was one of my students that I met in 1968 when I was lecturing at Dillard University [New Orleans, Louisiana].  He was there studying.  He had a huge medallion of Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] on his chest.  And when I finished, he came up, and we talked.  And later, he joined the mosque [Muhammad Mosque No. 46] in, I think in New Orleans, Louisiana and became a student minister of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  And in the fall of the Nation [Nation of Islam], he took the name Rashadeen [Maleek Rashadeen].  And when I began to rebuild, he came by my side, and was my helper from the early days, maybe '78 [1978], somewhere in '78 [1978].  I'm sure it wasn't '79 [1979].  It was in '78 [1978].  He became my helper, and as time went on, he disagreed with me.  I had to rebuke him because I had told him, I didn't like the way he was talking about the Jewish people.  And he made mockery of Spike Lee and said it in a derogatory way, something about his features.  And he called the sister, the Caucasian woman that played Cleopatra, who was a dear friend of Michael Jackson, called her a prostitute.
Speaker 1: Elizabeth Taylor, right.
Speaker 2: And then he talked about the hook nose Jew and the camel breath Arab and these kinds of things, I disagreed with.  I said, "You don't need to talk like that.  You can speak on principles that you disagree with, but getting personal like that is something that I won't tolerate."  And then he went to Kean University [Kean College; Kean University, Union County, New Jersey], I think, in New Jersey, and did the same thing.  And so I sat him down and rebuked him in the public.  And from there, it was downhill in relationships.  And so he very well loved by nationalist thinking black people.  He was an excellent teacher, and deep down inside, he's a very beautiful human being who really loved black people.
Story_ID: 633912
Speaker 1: But what I'm discovering with us, some of us have serious impediments that when you put us in a military line organization where you exercise authority, you can become very abusive.  And what I'm learning--and I don't know this of Brother Khalid [Khalid Abdul Muhammad], but he was always the macho man, strong black man.  And he would speak with great strength as his teachers did.  But when he unfortunately had to go to prison for a year, in prison if you do things to do get into trouble or fights, you get some kind of marks where you don't get time off for good behavior.  Brother Khalid in that prison environment was becoming a statesmen.  He's exceedingly brilliant, and he had black, Hispanic and whites following him in prison.  And when he came out, he sat in the dining room with me--breakfast room with me.  And I told him that the way you handled yourself in prison, you had followers of different ethnic and racial groups, I said, "That's the way you should handle yourself outside the prison."  And, unfortunately, those words didn't take root.  And so he went away from me.  And he was very angry with me when it looked like Wallace D. Muhammad [Wadith Deen Mohammed] and I reconciled differences.  And I knew he didn't understand, but he was the type of brother, who, if he disagreed with you, he wouldn't necessarily talk behind your back.  He would confront me, and he did.  And he said, "But I'm only saying what you taught me."  I said, "But Brother Khalid, I'm still teaching."  And he didn't, it seems to me, understand the evolutionary development of his teacher.  And he wanted to stay right there, beating up on white people and what not, and I'm trying to show him that Elijah Muhammad said that the white man can't keep you from accomplishing what God intends for you if you would get your own foot out of your own way.  Our problem is not outside.  Our problem is clearing ourselves of these mental and spiritual impediments that disallow us to do what other successful people do.  So I regret that my brother had an aneurysm and passed away.  But I believe if he had lived, he would have understood the wisdom of his teacher.  I can say this: nothing that is done is outside of the order of what God has permitted.  And even the negatives in your life, if you don't allow the negative to make you negative, the negative will always lead to a positive, based upon your own attitude toward what your struggling life takes you through.  And that's why, today, the minister [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], regardless of all the pressure, you know, God allows me to handle it with his help, you know.  So much for that.
Speaker 2: Well, that's good because I wasn't, I mean I know that he was, he was important to you, and I know that--
Speaker 1: Very important.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and that he had worked with you a long time.
Story_ID: 633913
Speaker 1: And I know that, you know, it, it came at a time that it exacerbated, you know, things, maybe?
Speaker 2: What came at a time?
Speaker 1: I mean his [Khalid Abdul Muhammad], his comments came at a time when, you know, you and the Jewish--it wasn't, there was no--it was exacerbating the relationship--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes--
Speaker 1: --is what I'm trying to say.
Speaker 2: Yes.  You know, Elijah Muhammad was this kind of a teacher.  I was with Brother Malcolm [Malcolm X] one day at Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts] in a small group of social scientists and other scholars.  And he had learned something negative about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And he brought up this negative thing about Dr. King and his alleged infidelity.  And there was a preacher in that audience who knew Dr. King.  He was so upset at what Brother Malcolm said.  He went immediately to the telephone to call Dr. King.  Dr. King was not present, but his wife, Coretta [Coretta Scott King], was there.  He didn't tell Coretta what he had heard.  But he just said he wanted to talk to Dr. King.  When word of what Brother Malcolm said got back to the messenger, the messenger sent for Malcolm and rebuked him.  He said, "When you disagree with a person, you disagree with them on the basis of principle, but when you start attacking them personally, you lose." Because if you can defeat a person's idea or the unprincipled way a person is doing, fine.  But when it gets personal, then you find yourself on the losing end.  So, the way he trained me is, I never attack any of my detractors personally.  It's on the basis of a principle.
Story_ID: 633914
Speaker 1: I'm wanna go to '95 [1995] when at the beginning of the year, you know, there was a conspiracy with Qubilah Shabazz, you know, on, on your life to assassinate you.  And then, then by the end of year, you know, you've convened this Million Man, Million Man March, which is--so I wanna, I wanna understand like when the Million Man March started to be planned, but we do have to, you know, I'd like to deal with the issue because that raised--I mean it sort of came out of nowhere.  I mean, you know, the--
Speaker 2: No, nothing that--
Speaker 1: No, I didn't mean Million Man March, I'm sorry, with Qubilah Shabazz (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well, as all part of government conspiracy, the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] came to my door.  And I think Brother Leonard [Leonard Muhammad] was here, and he went to the door, and they said that there's gonna be a press conference.  Someone was planning to assassinate the minister [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], and there's gonna be a press conference where we will bring out who it was and the circumstances.  So Leonard came and told me that afternoon.  We had no idea who it was, and it turned out to be Qubilah.  Well, by the time they made the announcement, the media is around my house to wait for my reaction.  Well, I'm not looking at Qubilah.  I'm looking at the way the FBI handled it, and I know Qubilah is a victim, as her father [Malcolm X] was, and as we are, if we fall into the trap.  So I never condemned Qubilah and had a press conference at the mosque and supported Qubilah.  And from there, her mother [Betty Shabazz] met with my son-in-law and my daughter, and we began to restructure a, a relationship.  And we were at the Apollo Theater [New York, New York] together. But--
Story_ID: 633915
Speaker 1: All of this, sister, comes from 1985 when I was speaking in Los Angeles [sic. Inglewood, California] at the Forum.  And the mayor of that town, Mr. Tom Bradley, and my friend, Jim Brown, and others, they wanted to soften my approach.  But I refused to let anybody water down my remarks.  Even Harold Washington sent some people to tell me to calm down my rhetoric, you know.  But for me, I'm in a fight now.  Don't you try to calm me down when I come back to the corner.  You're supposed to give me instructions on how to go back out and knock my opponent out.  So I told the man, if you look like you wanna calm me down, I'll take the stool and beat the hell out of you (laughter).  So, don't you come here trying to calm me down.  You go to them and tell them to calm down.  Well, anyway, so much for that, but in 1985, they tried to get Mayor Bradley to condemn me.  He wouldn't do it.  But after my speech that night, the next day, Mayor Bradley condemns Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], but had not heard my lecture.  So I left Los Angeles and went to San Diego [California] and from there to Tijuana [Mexico] and from Tijuana to a little village outside of Mexico City [Mexico] called Tepotzlan.  And there in that tiny village, on the night of September the 17th, I had an experience.  There's a mountain there that I used to climb, and on the top of that mountain is like a temple to Quetzalcoatl, and I would climb that mountain sometimes and just go on the top and pray.  But on the night of the 17th, I climbed that mountain with some companions in a vision like experience.  You can't climb that mountain in the night because there's no lights.  But I climbed that mountain, and by the time I got to the top of that mountain, it was lit up.  And one of these little UFOs [unidentified flying object] came over to the side of that mountain and called out to me to come.  And I'm a little afraid, so I call the group to come with me, and a voice said, "Not them, just you."  And when I came forward, I thought this wheel like object was gonna come over the land.  It had three extensions, like landing things, but it never came over the land.  And a heavy beam of light came out of that little wheel, and I was told to relax, and on a beam of light, I was taken up into this UFO, they called it, but we know what they are. And that thing took off, and I knew it was taking me to the giant wheel or Mother Plane which has fifteen hundred of those little wheels on them.
Story_ID: 633916
Speaker 1: This is the same wheel that Ezekiel saw.  You read it in the Bible.  He looked up in the middle of the air, there was a wheel, and it had eyes all around.  It was a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.  Well, that was a vision of Ezekiel, but it's real today.  It's up above our heads right now, and all over the world, they're talking about these objects that they see flying that appear to be from another planet.  They're not from another planet.  But we'll get into that at another time. But suffice it to say, I was taken to this huge wheel.  I couldn't see the pilot.  I knew he was there.  I'm sitting next to him, but I could not see him.  And he got out and opened some part of the wheel for me to get out, ushered me into a door and I was in a room with a speaker in the center, and I heard first a scroll roll down.  And there was cursive writing on the scroll, and I was trying to get close to read it.  And I heard the voice of Elijah Muhammad.  And he said to me, "The president [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] has met with his Joint Chiefs of Staff to plan a war.  I want you to hold a press conference and make known their plans and tell them that you got it from me, Elijah Muhammad on the wheel."  Then he said, "You have one more thing to do.  And when you have done it, you may come again to the wheel, and I will allow you to see me face to face."  And he excused me.  When I went out of that room and got back into that little wheel, it sped out from like a tunnel and turned and went up to a terrific height so I could look down on this huge wheel.  And it was like a city in the sky.  This wheel dropped me off outside of Washington, D.C.  I went into Washington, had a press conference--this is all in a vision like state now.  The next morning, I wake up, I don't remember anything.  That's the 18th.  But on the morning of the 19th, a great earthquake strikes Mexico City [Mexico].  And I'm standing up in the, in my little room.  My wife is in the bed, but I'm praying, and all of a sudden the room is shaking, the walls begin to look like water, and I looked at my wife in the bed.  There was no room under the bed to hide.  I ran to the window, and there was a pool below, and I could see the water just (gesture) dashing, you know, out of the pool.  And I said, "Honey, I think we're in a earthquake."  And later that morning, I went from Tepotzlan [Mexico] to Cuernavaca [Mexico] which is about maybe nineteen miles away.  And I went to the home of Tynnetta Muhammad, the wife of Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  And as I was walking up the stairs to her room, entering through the kitchen, the experience that I had came back to me.  And for the first time, I spoke it to Tynnetta Muhammad and my wife, Khadijah [Betsy Ross Walcott; Khadijah Farrakhan].  Now, this experience, I don't wanna take a lot of time because you can read about this and if you wanna put it in the history or documentary, you can.  But I went on a world tour after that.
Story_ID: 633917
Speaker 1: And while I was in Ghana, it came to me that it was Libya that America was going to attack.  I cut the tour.  Brother Khalid [Khalid Abdul Muhammad] then was walking with me on the road, and he said, "Minister, I have never done anything of great value.  Why don't you let me go to Libya and warn Gaddafi [Muammar Gaddafi]?"  And I told him, but, you know, there was a fifty thousand dollar fine and ten years imprisonment for going to Libya.  And the secretary of state at that time and the attorney general, Edwin Meese and Shultz [George P. Shultz].  But I'm already overseas.  Now, they got a thing that I'm going to jail if I go to Libya.  I told Brother Khalid, "You and my son, you go back to America, and you start making the tour, hands off Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], but I'm going to Libya."  I sent my family home.  I went to Libya, and when I got to Libya, they had a police escort for me.  And the next evening, almost the whole Libyan government was in my suite except Brother Gaddafi.  And I told them this experience, and I told them that America was going to attack, and they were gonna try to destroy his water project, his communication, the airfield.  Sure enough, within forty-eight hours, there was a high powered American aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Sirte, or Sidra as they call it.  And one of the planes that was on that carrier came over and got shot down by the Libyans.  I knew that the war was on then, but somehow, they didn't attack.  I didn't understand why, but I got out of Libya and went to Saudi Arabia.  And when I got to Saudi Arabia, of course, the attack on Libya happened.  But I read in the Arab news--it's an English language paper, that there was a bright object in the sky over the Gulf of Sirte.  And what happened was, the aircraft carrier was one of their most modern technologically, and something happened to its technology, and it had to go back to Florida.  And another one was sent in its place, and when that one came, the attack on Libya took place.  Now, I did not know that Gaddafi was living where the communications center was.  And the attack was on the communications, but it was a direct attack on Gaddafi's life.  And he had just gotten up from where he was, moved out of that room into another room when the missile struck.  So they had intelligence that they knew exactly where he was.  So there was an uprising in Libya from some of the negative elements against Gaddafi, and of course, they got rounded up.  And they were all killed.
Story_ID: 633918
Speaker 1: Well, now, I'm back in the United States, and this is 1997, was it?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Nineteen eighty-six [1986].
Speaker 1: Nineteen eighty-seven [1987] that I'm, I'm on a plane, I think it was '87 [1987].  And there's a, you know, they have magazine, and New York, a magazine--section of the magazine.  And I pulled it out of the pocket in front of me, and in it: "Libya, Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] planned war against Libya."  So when I opened the thing to read, the exact words that I was told in '85 [1985].  It says, in September 1987, Ronald Reagan met with his Joint Chiefs of Staff to plan the war against Libya.  Then it went on to say that Reagan asked Mubarak [Hosni Mubarak] of Egypt to attack Libya from the east.  But Mubarak would not do it.  So the bombing did not bring about the results (cough), excuse me, which was the overthrow of Libya.  It was the most expensive assassination attempt in the history of America because the planes had to leave England.  France wouldn't allow the planes to fly across French territory or Spanish territory.  It had to come down and then into the Mediterranean, and it had to be refueled and then, of course, bomb these places in Libya.  Well, after that experience, and I realized--
Story_ID: 633931
Speaker 1: You were at the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  You were, you said that that was the most expensive-
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Assassination.
Speaker 1: Assassination attempt (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) assassination attempt.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm back in the United States.  But I began to realize that it wasn't just an attack on Libya.  It's an attack now on small Muslim nations.  And if you look, Libya is a big country with a small population.  But from Ronald Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] and before him Jimmy Carter [President James Earl "Jimmy" Carter, Jr.] with the hostage crisis, he planned to go in and retrieve the hostages.  It's a war with Iran, and in 1991, Iraq.  Now, under Brother Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], Americans are fighting in Yemen.  They don't, it's not known now.  Special operation troops are now in Pakistan.  American people don't know that yet.  But these drones are being sent into these Muslim countries, and they're killing innocent people along with those that America feels are insurgents or members of quote, unquote Al-Qaeda.  So now, I'm looking.  At the same time black folk, a movie comes out, 'Colors.'  Another movie comes out 'Boyz n the Hood.'  Another movie comes out 'Menace II Society.'  How is this portraying young, black men?  Time magazine picks it up, Newsweek magazine and these movies are going all over the world, showing young black men as savage, brutal beast like humans.  So if anything happens, and there's an attack on black youth, there's nobody in the world gonna cry out because you're killing something that's really destructive to your entire society.  So I go on a tour, Stop the Killing.  Then when I come back from that tour, I realize that black men are the targets.  So I start going into cities talking to black men.  A Nigerian brother who ran from Nigeria, and he was in the opposition to Abacha [Sani Abacha] is now an educator here, he came to befriend me, and he said, "Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], don't talk just to black men because if you do, they're gonna say you're trying to raise an army."  But my experience was that I had to talk to black men because they're at the root of the problem.  So I went on a tour.  And the record is clear, thousands upon thousands of black men came out to hear me.
Story_ID: 633932
Speaker 1: And when I was in New York [New York], fourteen thousand black men in the armory [369th Regiment Armory, New York, New York], and it came out of my mouth, the Million Man March.  I'm gonna take a million men to Washington [D.C.].  Well, after I said, I went to work to make my word bond, and here again, [HistoryMaker] Haki Madhubuti, the nationalist community, the Christian community.  But the first people I wrote was Wallace D. Mohammed [Warith Deen Mohammed] and Reverend Jesse Jackson [HistoryMaker Reverend Jesse L. Jackson], saying, "If a million black men are gonna be there, I would like you all to be there to speak to them."  I never heard from Reverend Jackson at first, and Imam Wallace Deen never answered.  But Reverend Jackson came aboard late in the day after some of the members of the civil rights group kind of got on him, you know.  [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height, she was one of the strongest advocates.  And at the Million Man March, though we were beaten up for having only men, if you looked on the rostrum, there was Betty Shabazz.  There was [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou.  There was some of the--Malcolm's [Malcolm X] children.  There was Rosa Parks.  There, I mean we honored black women, though we took the heat for dealing with the weakness of black men.  I talked to Colin Powell [HistoryMaker General Colin L. Powell].  He had put out his book and was doing a book tour.  And I called General Powell, and I said to him, "General, your troops await you."  I said, "The strongest characteristic of your life is your discipline."  I said, "And the weakness of black men in America is we don't have discipline.  If you could stand in front of them and appeal to them?"  He said, "Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], I'm gonna see what I can do."  This is General Powell.  And he said, "If I can cancel one of my book engagements, I'll be there with you."  He spoke to that man on Channel 7--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Stephanopoulos.
Speaker 1: Who?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  George Stephanopoulos.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, not Stephanopoulos, the older man.
Speaker 2: The older man on Channel 7?
Speaker 1: That used to be--
Speaker 2: You mean here in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: No, this is New York national television.  There was a thing that Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama] had to go to and he was involved in that as well.  I can't recall his name.  But anyway, after he spoke to this man, who is a reporter, but very influential among Republicans, I never heard from Colin Powell.  I talked to--who was the lawyer that defended O.J. [O.J. Simpson]?
Speaker 2: Johnnie Cochran.
Speaker 1: I talked to Johnnie Cochran.  He was gonna be there, and he got on television on that Sunday morning and the reporter that died--
Speaker 2: You're talking about (unclear)--
Speaker 1: A white reporter.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Tim Russert.
Speaker 1: Tim Russert (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Tim Russert, okay.
Speaker 1: Tim Russert, they clipped some of my words when I talked about blood suckers in the black community.  And I said, "Anybody that takes from the community and gives nothing back is a blood sucker."  And I mentioned the Koreans.  I mentioned Jews, I mentioned blacks, but they cut everybody out except Jews.  And when he heard that, he said, "Oh, that's so unfortunate."  And Johnnie Cochran never showed up.  So, I mean, the work that they did against the Million Man March was such that even though we didn't have the support of the media, yet God blessed us to have the largest crowd ever gathered on that Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] and the most peaceful and successful day.
Story_ID: 633933
Speaker 1: It could not have happened without the collaboration of nationalists, Christians, Hebrew Israelites; we all worked together to produce that phenomenal day.  But Al Wellington, who is like a pollster, as well as a researcher, he did a poll that day.  Twelve percent of the people that came were Muslim, and 80 some percent were Christians.  And when the Christians found out that they answered the call--I'm talking about white Christians, that Christians answered the call of a quote, unquote (air quotes) black Muslim, they inspired black preachers then to condemn me and attack me.  And they started calling me the anti-Christ and churches that I could go in and preach before the Million Man March, after the Million Man March, their doors were closed to Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  So the fight intensified.  From 1995, now, we had in 2000 the Million Family March.  And we packed the Mall [National Mall, Washington, D.C.] again, not with as many but over a million.  And we had Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Christians--all kind of religious and racial groupings.  And the ministers spoke on what the kingdom of God will look like because all human beings will be a part of his kingdom if we accept righteousness and obedience to his will.
Story_ID: 633934
Speaker 1: After that 2005, the tenth anniversary of the Million Man March, what? What?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You skipped so much.
Speaker 1: You did.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, look, we're gonna write a book--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, and this was not meant to be a book.  This was meant to be a historical document that people could look at when--
Speaker 1: You mean, you mean, he's skipping over--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  The world tour [World Friendship Tour].
Speaker 1: Right, the world tour.
Speaker 2: Say what?
Speaker 1: But before we get to the world tours, can I just ask, I remember that the success that you're saying, or I heard you say, of being interviewed, the success of the Million Man March, you weren't--
Speaker 2: Afterwards, I was depressed.
Speaker 1: Why, why is that?
Speaker 2: Because I didn't know what the next step was.  I'm depressed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So, was it because you were fighting so much to make it happen that you--
Speaker 2: I lost sight of what to do--
Speaker 1: After.
Speaker 2: --afterwards.  So after it was over, I'm depressed because it's over.  It's a great success.  But then what?  So I went back to my experience on the wheel, all right.  Well, when I looked in that magazine, President Reagan [President Ronald Wilson Reagan] was trying to get Barack [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], the Muslim brother of Gaddafi [Muammar Gaddafi], to attack him from the east.  So I said, "Aha, what they're gonna try to do is say that we are not true Muslims, and attack us from the east."  So I got up then and went on the world tour.  And I went into the Muslim worlds, and boy, were we received as kings, really, and rulers in the Muslim world.  We traveled throughout Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, and everywhere we went, the Million Man March gave the people hope because they recognized that if this black man in America became politically active and became a political force, we could help to reshape America's domestic policy as well as her horrendous foreign policy.  So they, of course, beat me.  They said I squandered all the good that happened with the Million Man March.  But I made, by the grace of God, friends for us in our struggle all over the world.  And we can give you, Joshua [Farrakhan's son, Joshua Farrakhan] has a version--I guess you would call it a synopsis, of my tours around the world.  And you could see all of the leaders that God blessed us to meet and their reaction to Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], and the people's reaction.  It was overwhelming.
Speaker 1: Do you think if you had it to--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  A correction (unclear) he meant Mubarak [Hosni Mubarak], he said, Obama.
Speaker 1: Yeah, you did, you did say Obama, and I--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I thought he was--yeah, it was Mubarak.
Speaker 2: From the east, it was to be Mubarak.  Well, and that's why I went to the east because I thought--thank you, brother.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Thank you very much.
Story_ID: 633935
Speaker 1: If you had to do the Million Man March again, if you had the occasion, that moment in time, would you have done something differently about that because a lot of eyes were on you, and a lot of men were expecting--they wanted to be shown what to do.  It was so empowering.  I remember my father [HistoryMaker Julius Richardson] just crying as he watched the TV.  He wasn't feeling well, but he, you know, he was just crying because--and a lot of people cried because it was such--and it affected so many people for years to come (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It did.
Speaker 1: --because it was such a strong showing, and a, you know, a community--
Speaker 2: If I had it to do again--well, let me tell you what was in my heart.  So when you've got--you called--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Taping changing (unclear).
Speaker 2: Oh, when you call for a million, and nearly 2 million show up, you have a standing army in front of you.  The fear in the U.S. government that day, all city administration closed down.  [U.S.] Congress closed down.  The [U.S.] Supreme Court closed down, and Bill Clinton [President William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton] left town.  So, you think that they turned over Washington, D.C. to 2 million black men.  The [U.S.] Armed Forces were there in tunnels and what not.  If we had broken into madness, the media would have carried the slaughter of black people to the entire world.  My security met with Washington's security, government security, D.C. police, and they said if anything happened, they had a route for Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] to get out.  And I told my security man, "If you put your hands on me, I will fight you.  But if anything happens that day, I will die with my people."  Now, nothing did happen that day, but in my heart, I wanted to show white people, and particularly, the Jews, say look at the power that God has put in my hands.  But listen to the words of my speech.  It's atonement, reconciliation and accepting responsibility to change our reality.  I'm showing you that I am not the type of a leader that God will put power in my hands and then I'm gonna threaten you like we're gonna go to war.  See, that's what the ignorant of my people would have wanted me to do, but I was showing them that I am not only a responsible person, but I'm trying to get my people where God wants them to be without a tremendous loss of innocent life.  And so, if I had to do over again, oh, yeah.  I would lay out stuff for black people to do for our survival, but I laid out on that day eight principles for atonement, reconciliation and responsibility.  And those principles, if they're followed, will be successful in our interpersonal relationships.  Imagine, Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] telling us that we should be nonviolent to a people that have done nothing but violence to us, hm?  Now look, we're nonviolent to white people, but we're violent to each other.  So what good is it, if you can't bring a nonviolent message that was the hallmark of the civil rights group, you can't bring that message home and help our people to be nonviolent where we're concerned.  And we're slaughtering each other over nothing.  So the message is not for white people in that sense.  It's to cleanse, reform, transform the lives of black people.
Story_ID: 633936
Speaker 1: You know, you look like the picture of health now, but, and, you know, you got really ill.  And it was a holdover from your, the radiation that you had had.  And I just--we know you got sick, and you're better, and we know that people like Cornel West and [HistoryMaker] Tavis Smiley and, you know, [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte and Reverend Pfleger [Michael Pfleger] and a whole host of people were praying for your recovery.  What, can you tell me, because to get that close--I mean you felt close to death's doors, did you?
Speaker 2: Well, I was close.  I didn't feel close, but I certainly was close because when I was close to death, I was not conscious.  I put it like this.  Cancer is a disease that you never beat all the time.  You have to always have your wits about you once you've had a fight with cancer because it crops up in other places.  I--Brock Peters had prostate cancer.  He overcame it, and when Brock and I met again, maybe six months before he passed, he was suffering from another type of cancer because he won it in the prostrate, but it attacked him, I think, in the liver.  So cancer is a battle that you never go to sleep saying I won.  You always say, I'm still fighting that fight.  For me, though I may look like the picture of health, and I thank God always for that, the reality is that my operation, for the last ten years particularly, from 2000 to 2010 have severely curtailed the quality of my life.  And in 2007, this same month of December, I went in the hospital and I had what is called a complete pelvic exenteration where all my organs in the lower pelvic region were taken.  But I mean I, I smile through all of that because I'm alive.  I can think.  I can greet friends.  I can travel, you know.  So my quality of life in one sense is curtailed, but in another sense, it's heightened because when you come too close to death, you realize how precious life is.  And even a tiny blade of grass that you would walk on yesterday without considering means something today, just to be out in the snow, to see the ice and to feel the wind, knowing that one day, you'll neither see nor feel anymore.  So I thank God every day that he gives me another day to do what I do.  And it is He who has kept me, and it is He who is keeping me.  It is He who allows me to look like the picture of health.  Though I well may be better than I was, I'm not completely healed because when they took out the prostate and the bladder and the rectum and all that they took from me, they found that I had colon cancer.  So they took out a lot of my intestines.  So January of 2011, I'll be four years fighting colon cancer, ten years fighting prostate cancer.  They say I got one more year with the colon cancer to say I'm cancer free, but I don't think I'll ever make that declaration.  I'll just wait, and I pray that one more thing, that my teacher told me I have to do, then I can come again to that wheel.

Speaker 1: It's very significant to me because right now, our president [HistoryMaker President Barack Obama], a beautiful brother, is being pushed to attack Iran over the thought that Iran is building a nuclear weapon like Iraq had a stockpile of, what do you call it, weapons of mass destruction (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Weapons of mass destruction.
Speaker 1: But look how many young people have died, both Americans and Iraqis and others and there're no weapons of mass destruction.  But if America allows Israel to attack Iran, Iran will respond, and America will be drawn into a war with another Muslim country.  I can't participate in that.  I can't advocate fighting some people that are not doing anything to America but pursuing what, by international law, they have a right to do which is to develop atomic energy for the purpose of energy and not for the purpose of building weapons.  So I'm concerned that our president may have to sign an executive order concerning Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  But whatever God has for me is fine, you know.  I know we're living at the end of this world, and the establishment of the kingdom of God.  America does not have a great future, not at all.  And the only way America will have a future is if America changes.  And she's not changing.  She's getting worse.

Speaker 1: Today, on the front cover of The Final Call magazine--get the paper, quickly.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Unclear).
Speaker 1: Quickly. There's a black man [Frederick Jermaine Carter] in Greenwood, Mississippi that was hanged.  They said he hung himself.  We sent our reporters down, and I've asked them, since they're talking about an independent forensic analysis, I offered to pay for it myself because we want to know did the man kill himself or is this the beginning of another season of the destruction of black men.  And as you look at Oscar Grant [Oscar Grant III] in San Francisco [sic. Oakland, California], shot to death while he's in submission and subjection, and the man says he's reaching for a Taser.  Well, why would you reach for a Taser when a man is not struggling against you and you took your pistol out by mistake.  You mean you don't know the feel of a pistol from a Taser?  See, but when you're a liar, and you're trying to cover your evil, your brother judge, your brother, prosecuting attorney, they all work together to get the enemy off with a light sentence, while my brother lies dead.  But there's a god watching, and that's who America has to be careful of today because God is definitely punishing America and the world.  Can I have that paper?
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  We don't have one here, sir, sorry.

Speaker 1: The three questions are, one, what have you not done in your life that would be, that is important for you?  Two, what you hope to see for the future of the Nation of Islam?  And three, your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, my life, after finding Elijah Muhammad, was to try to help people to understand this black man and grow to love him as I love him.  I feel like Paul who found Jesus and wanted all of the Gentiles to love Jesus as he loved him.  I have not completed that task, but Elijah Muhammad said, of me, that my value to him was that through me he would get all of his people.  And I don't know that I'll live long enough, but one thing about truth and goodness and righteous, the grave can't hold it.  My physical body will one day return to the earth, but what I am in truth, and what I've done for righteousness' sake, that will live.  And people just don't know Louis Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan].  They don't know the body of knowledge that I have blessed to receive from the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  They see me as a warrior spirit which I am, but I'm also a teacher with something wonderful to share, not only with my people, but with all of humanity, and ultimately, whether I'm living or dead, that knowledge will come to the fore and our people will eventually see Elijah Muhammad for the man that he really is and grow to love him for what he has done to help black people reach our destiny.  That's the first question.
Story_ID: 633940
Speaker 1: The second question was?
Speaker 2: What do you want to, what, what are your hopes for the Nation of Islam?
Speaker 1: Well, my hope for the Nation is that we will ultimately, as a people, become a real nation.  We are a nation within a nation.  And as America is closing down and this modern pharaoh has literally let us go.  They don't have anything more for us to do.  We're falling out of the educational system.  Fifty percent of us don't even graduate from high school.  So in a highly technological age, what is there for us to do if we're uneducated, illiterate, ignorant and taking pride in being that?  So my hope is that sooner or later, we'll come to see that we can no longer depend on the benevolent white president or black president to solve the complex problems of black people. That it is for us to do this, and not for others to do it for us.  This is a duty imposed on every life by God that you must do something for yourself.
Story_ID: 633941
Speaker 1: And the last question is legacy.
Speaker 2: What's your legacy?
Speaker 1: I don't think much about my legacy.  I, I'm still a man writing my testament, and it's not for me to assign my own place in history.  That's for God and the historians to do, if my life is of value.  You can never get your reward while you're living because there's not enough known about you while you're still writing your testament.  Look at Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  Look at Malcolm [Malcolm X].  Look at Garvey [Marcus Garvey], look at W.E.B. Du Bois, look at the great women of our struggle.  While they're living, they're writing their testament.  It's when death comes that people, historians come and say, well, this is Rosa Parks' legacy.  This is Dr. King's legacy.  This is Paul Robeson's legacy.  See, Farrakhan's [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan] legacy, is not legacy, legacy, legacy.  It's not for me.  If I think like some vain people think, I've got to do this for the sake of history.  I gotta--in other words, you try to manipulate events so that you can look good in history.  Yeah, I don't care nothing about that.  I'm writing my history every day, and I'm writing it in a sense with my own blood.  My blood is my life fluid, and I live my life for the liberation of our people, for the destruction of Satan's world, and for the implementation and establishment of the kingdom of God so that all human beings that will live on this earth after Satan's world is gone, will live in peace and freedom, justice, equality. That's what I live for.  And so when you write your legacy in the blood of your life, then let history and the historians assign me my place.  But as of right now, I'm always thinking of what next to do, as long as I have life.  I continue to work, and if I'm blessed to do that one more thing and see my teacher [Elijah Muhammad] in reality, then you'll see me again, and I won't look like I'm looking now, and I will be healed absolutely all the way.  And if God will grant me more life, I can't do no more than continue to struggle for the freedom of us as a people and for the freedom of every human being that will accept righteousness.
Speaker 2: Thank you, minister, thank you.
Speaker 1: Well, I want to--
Speaker 2: Oh, we can't bring you out. (Laughter) I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: But I personally say--
Story_ID: 633949
Speaker 1: You've reconciled again with God.  So here's a child coming out of the womb of its mother with already a predetermined idea at the root of that child that it's gonna do in its life.  So, and it was no event like some white man striking me or some Jewish person doing something ugly to me that makes me who and what I am.  I am that because God determined that for me even before I was in the womb of my mother [Sarah Mae Manning Clarke; Sumayyah Farrakhan].  So I'm here now, and that's why people--I mean regardless, you may not like Farrakhan [HistoryMaker Minister Louis Farrakhan], but when you get acquainted with me, and you really tap into me, you know you're tapping into something far different from other people you talk with.  No, no, no.  This is a child of destiny, and I'm doing only what I was born into this world to do.  And when I have finished what God has set for me to do, I'll return to him.  So I, that's why, you kept digging, well, what is it?  I mean is it something in your life?  I mean what moved you?  What--no, no, no, it was God all the time that birthed me for you, that birthed me for the suffering of black people, that birthed me for the suffering of humanity.  And Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm [Malcolm X] and all the people that have come into my life are preparing me to fulfill my destiny which is for the freedom, justice and equality for all those deprived.  We wanna be free.  We wanna be justified.  We wanna be equal.  A womb is gonna produce a child, and that child may not know that it is that child of destiny until it starts to do its work.  And so that's what you're digging at; that's what it is.  May God bless you.
Speaker 2: May God bless you, too.
Speaker 1: And I thank you.  I really am grateful--
Speaker 2: I'm very grateful for you.
Speaker 1: --because if you didn't question me, this wouldn't be on the record.
Speaker 2: No.  I can't thank you enough because I was afraid--I was, you know, I had tried every year--
Speaker 1: I know you did.
Speaker 2: --from the Million Man project [Million Man March] (laughter).
Speaker 1: And that same man is trying to cut you off.  You wouldn't be here--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I know.
Speaker 1: --if Josh [Farrakhan's son, Joshua Farrakhan]--, "Wait, now, you did promise her, and you've got to do it, Dad."
Speaker 2: No, Joshua did, no.  I can't thank you enough 'cause every year--
Speaker 1: He did, he did.
Speaker 2: --we would write.  I think I had given up the last couple of years.  But that day in the N'DIGO event [N'DIGO Foundation Gala] when I said, when I heard you were in the audience, it was very--
Speaker 1: And you came to me--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and I gave you my word that night--
Speaker 2: You did.
Speaker 1: --and that man made it happen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  No, I really--I can't thank you enough.  I can't.
Speaker 1: It's like, it's mutual.
Speaker 2: That's right.  Thank you.
Speaker 1: So may God continue to bless you--
Speaker 2: Thank you so much, sir, thank you.
Speaker 1: --and your efforts.  You know, I gotta look at this.  You know this is a much better picture than the last time, I gotta tell you.
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: They've got a flower behind me somewhere.
Speaker 2: No, no, we had the flower, we had it behind you.
Speaker 1: Oh, you did?
