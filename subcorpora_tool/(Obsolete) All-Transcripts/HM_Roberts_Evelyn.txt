Speaker 1: How many children did Ferdinand--if you don't know it, not a prob--
Speaker 2: Eight.

Speaker 2: He was quite influential it seems like because he--
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: --he had several government offices and even went to Washington City [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: Washington City was not Washington, D.C.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

Speaker 1: Their [Roberts' maternal great-grandparents, Nicie Battle and Lucian N.B. Battle] oldest or their eighth child, Laura Battle [Laura Battle Richardson], was one of those eight, eight children.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she grew up there.  Did she have any schooling, the--
Speaker 2: She learned to read because she was brought up by the white part of the family.  She was taken into the family as a playmate for the other white children. And you know, they didn't want them playing with the little rednecks out there.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, so she, she did get some schooling.  She at least learned to, to, to--
Speaker 2: She learned to read (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) to read, okay.
Speaker 2: Because I mentioned, whatever they did, she did right along with them.

Speaker 2: I don't--
Speaker 1: --she bore these children and lived her life?
Speaker 2: I, I don't know anything except that, you know, just--and I, I got that from my cousin, Juanita [ph.], who--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --like I said, she has the history.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  There came a time, Laura growing up in that household, she did learn to read and--did she learn to write also?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: To, to read and write, and--
Speaker 2: Also, she, she evidently had the strong bonds to some of those, some of her cousins--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because she was an integral part of the household--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause she told me once that she went to a family wedding (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: And when she got there, they said, "Oh, Laura, I'm so glad to see you because nobody here knows how to make beaten biscuits."  So she put on an apron and went in the kitchen and made the beaten biscuits.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's a special kind of biscuits you know.
Speaker 1: I did not know, but before we get into that, let's, let's establish who the cousins were.  What--
Speaker 2: These are the white cousins--
Speaker 1: These are the white cousins, okay.
Speaker 2: --on, on the Battle side.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm trying to--Ferdinand [sic.] was the father of the white cousins also, as well as--
Speaker 2: They're in the family.  You know, they had big extended families in those days.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, but they all lived on the same--
Speaker 2: I don't know that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't know that.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And I didn't, I don't even know if there was a plantation.
Speaker 1: Okay, right, and that's why I was trying to be careful on that.  But let's just--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --say sight where Ferdinand--
Speaker 2: Well, they probably had a big house.
Speaker 1: Right, they had to have a big house and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and some substantial land.  Once Laura was invited to a wedding of the white Battles.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And they were happy to see her--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: --and asked.
Speaker 2: --this is the older generation.
Speaker 1: This was, right--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  And so they asked her to make some beat--now, now tell us what beaten bis- biscuits are.
Speaker 2: I guess they're beat, biscuits that you beat (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: But anyway, it's a special kind of a biscuit.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And Laura apparently--
Speaker 2: Yeah, she--
Speaker 1: --had a reputation.
Speaker 2: --she was a good cook.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And she was one of those kind of cooks with a pinch of this and a dollop of that and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and no, no recipes.
Speaker 1: Those were the best kinds of biscuits.
Speaker 2: But anyway, so after she, after she had baked the biscuits, she took of the apron and went in and sat down at the table.  And all the younger people were looking at her, you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Wondering what she was doing.
Speaker 2: What was she doing there (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Right, but she did not get up; she, she stayed.
Speaker 2: No, she was part of the family.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  And the older Battles recognized this.
Speaker 2: Of course.
Speaker 1: And the younger--
Speaker 2: They're the ones who invited her in the first place.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) oh, okay, all right.  Do we have anything to indicate a time period, even if we're, you know, a best guesstimate on, on this with Laura?
Speaker 2: Well, it had to be after the Civil War.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this would be following the, the, the Civil War on, on this.  What did--you don't have any stories on the, Nicie and Laura during the Civil War or anything?
Speaker 2: No (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, okay.

Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --as much as history (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) when he married my grandmother, he became black--

Speaker 2: As--
Speaker 1: --black side.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Again, I keep asking, any idea of what we talking about, 1865, 1868, '70 [1870]?
Speaker 2: I haven't a clue, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: To his house--
Speaker 1: To his house.
Speaker 2: --to see, to see the lights.  And he had indoor plumbing (laughter).

Speaker 2: He made his money as a barber--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --for, for white clients--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause they, they were--he was charging fifty cents while the, the ordinary black person was making fifty cents a day.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And he was charging fifty cents a person.
Speaker 1: So he was a barber par excellence.
Speaker 2: Yeah, entrepreneur.  He joined all kinds of black fraternal organizations, and he was a big lay member in the A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But if he were to walk in the door right now, you would say who is that white man?
Speaker 1: Because he would, just judging by his color--
Speaker 2: Just judging by his color.
Speaker 1: And probably skin.

Speaker 1: Oh, (laughter) unbelievable.  My mother would fix all this fried chicken and oranges.
Speaker 2: And oranges, okay.
Speaker 1: And oranges.  And we'd eat all the way there.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) And the roads I imagine were just narrow ruts--
Speaker 1: I remember one time we had just come out of the mountains, and everybody was asleep in the car except my father [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] driving.  And I was in the back seat, and my two brothers [Ernest Freeman, Jr. and Arthur Freeman] were on either side of me.  And I'll tell ya, I was scared, 'cause I look out and nothing (laughter), absolutely nothing.  And I'll you, when we--it was just about dawn when we finally got down from the mountains.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: My father looked up there and see where he came from, I swear he blanched (laughter).  He changed color.
Speaker 2: But you, would you make that trip once a year or--
Speaker 1: In the summer.

Speaker 1: I don't remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) remembrance--
Speaker 1: I don't remember the first time, but I remember they had the parlor.  And that was all, that was always shut.

Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --you had to pump it like mad.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then at one, I remember one summer I got a chance to tie tobacco--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because tobacco crop was my grandfather's money crop.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: I remember one time he was bragging he made ten thousand dollars.
Speaker 2: That's like a million [dollars] today.
Speaker 1: I'm telling you.  And so anyway, it was a, a whole process, you know, that these, they all, had already been dried.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then you had to tie them.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And boy, when I got through, all my hands were just as brown as they could be.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) But you had done the work.
Speaker 1: I had done the work.
Speaker 2: And, and they could hang up the tobacco to dry. And they--

Speaker 1: There came a time when the children of Laura [Laura Battle Richardson] and P.A. Richardson [Plummer Alston Richardson] were getting to be older.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, they, they sent, they sent the children to boarding school.
Speaker 1: Oh, they did?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: How early did they go to boarding school--
Speaker 2: I imagine they went in--
Speaker 1: --or approximate--
Speaker 2: --in their teens.
Speaker 1: In the teens, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --my mother [Gertrude Richardson Freeman] telling me that she came home crying one day.  She must have been still in the elementary school.  She came home crying one day.  The kids had called her an ishy [ph.].
Speaker 1: What is that?
Speaker 2: And she didn't know what it was.  It sounded so bad, and my grandfather had to explain to her that it was a free issue.
Speaker 1: Ah, free issue.
Speaker 2: Free issue.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Because they, they hadn't been born slaves.
Story_ID: 505826
Speaker 1: I know you said you, that you don't remember your mother [Gertrude Richardson Freeman] talking a lot about her childhood growing up, her early years in school.  But there did come a time when your mother left home to go off to boarding school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --am I correct?
Speaker 2: Well, they all, they all went off to boarding school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she went to Cheyney [Cheyney Training School for Teachers; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] in Pennsylvania.  That was one of the schools she went to.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: I think it's, it's a state school now.
Speaker 1: It is, it's a state school--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --run by--
Speaker 2: But she was very real educated.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She had, she, she had Latin and Greek.
Speaker 1: Well, she would not have been ready for those things if she had not been prepared I think back in, in Nashville [North Carolina].
Speaker 2: I doubt it (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, so, she--
Speaker 2: I doubt it very seriously.
Speaker 1: Well, I don't mean, you know, the college.  I meant the elementary level preparation.
Speaker 2: I doubt it very seriously.
Speaker 1: Oh, is--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you don't think there, there was--
Speaker 2: No, 'cause schools are very inadequate.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, you think, have any idea of what, what, how old she was when she went to that boarding school, teenager?
Speaker 2: I imagine she was, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As soon as they were old enough to go, you know, they were shipped off.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And not only did your mother go, but Ethel [Nancy Ethel Richardson] and P.B. [P.B. Richardson] and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --all of them--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --went, went to these boarding schools.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so they could get an education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And would, did you hear anything that would indicate that Ethel or P. B. or Diane [ph.] went to a different school than the one that your mother went to?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  My mother went to Kitchel [ph.] first.  And the last school she went to was Cheyney.
Speaker 1: Okay, Kitchel, where, where is Kitchel?
Speaker 2: I don't know whether it was in North Carolina or not--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but, but Cheyney was in Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  Cheyney is still turning out fine young people, by the way.  The--let's--anything that you heard from your mom of what life was like at Cheyney?
Speaker 2: No, except that she evidently enjoyed it.  I remember her saying that at the end of the semester that they'd be marrying couples (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: And, and going and getting girls out of other girls' rooms.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  Are we talking about--since your mom was born in 1919, and she would be a teenager when she went to Cheyney.  So therefore--
Speaker 2: No, she wasn't born in 1919.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: That was me (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, I'm sorry.  No, I have the wrong thing.
Speaker 2: I'm the one.  She was, I think she was born around maybe '8, 1898 or--
Speaker 1: Okay, right.
Speaker 2: --something like that [sic. 1867].
Speaker 1: Right, I'm sorry.  What I have here is (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --eighteen ninety--1898 for your dad [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] and--
Speaker 2: No, I think he was born just a little before that 'cause he was about five years older.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I have, I have 1901--
Speaker 2: I think, I think her--
Speaker 1: --for, for your mom.
Speaker 2: --I think, think it was about 1898.
Speaker 1: Okay, for, for--
Speaker 2: My, my mother.
Speaker 1: For your mother?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, I'll change that to 1898, and your dad, you think maybe 1893 or '4 [1894]?
Speaker 2: It could be, it could be that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause he was five years old, five years older.
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm gonna make 1893.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And this tells me that this is our best guess. Where I'm going with, with this is that my--1915 your mother is attending Cheyney boarding school, just going by, you know, some dates here (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And do you remember your mom mentioning anything you--well, you said she took Latin there.
Speaker 2: Latin and Greek (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And Greek.  And any other incidents that she may have mentioned to you?
Speaker 2: Oh, she was very good in math.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, she was very good in math.  And any experiences that she may have related to you that stick out--
Speaker 2: No, just--
Speaker 1: --in your mind?
Speaker 2: No, just, just in passing I think she had mentioned the fact that they had a lot of, lot going on there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now was Cheyney, did boys and, and girls attend Cheyney?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It was a normal school--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and where you prepare to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay. And did she want to be a teacher?
Speaker 2: I think that's what she was preparing for.
Story_ID: 505827
Speaker 1: Did she [Roberts' mother, Gertrude Richardson Freeman] meet your dad [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] there at Cheyney [Cheyney Training School for Teachers; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They met, of all places, in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's, so we don't get too far ahead, the, when she, when she finished Cheyney--how long did she stay at Cheyney approximately?
Speaker 2: I don't think she had finished.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Think she was still going.
Speaker 1: All right.  And so, during the period she was at Cheyney, she came home I guess one summer for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she met your dad?
Speaker 2: At a picnic, at a church picnic.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You remember what year that was?
Speaker 2: No, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't they ever mentioned the year, but it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --just before the war [World War I, WWI].
Speaker 1: Okay, so around 1913, '14 [1914]?
Speaker 2: No, I think it was later than that.  It probably would be around 1916 or '17 [1917].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good enough.  And now, tell us about the experience of your mother meeting your dad.
Speaker 2: Well, it must have been love at first sight.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And my father considered himself quite worldly 'cause he'd been all over the country--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --had been in Atlanta [Georgia], where there were always, always two women to every man.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: But he's, I, I guess he saw this woman at, at the church picnic, and so they had a date for the next, the following Sunday.  And a quarter to eight, eight he was standing there looking at his watch (laughter).
Speaker 1: So he came early, make sure, okay.  And so one week after the picnic they had a date?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Anything you know about that experience?
Speaker 2: No, I don't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --know anything about that.  But I do know when he was drafted for the [U.S.] Army--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my mother was supposed to be on her way back to school, back to Cheyney, and instead, she met him in Chillicothe [Ohio], and they got married.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.  So she did not go back to Cheyney; she, she got married?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that was sometime--(unclear)--1916, 1917.  And after they got married--
Speaker 2: He went immediately into Army.
Speaker 1: He went into the Army.  And your mother?
Speaker 2: Went to Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: She went to Cleveland.
Speaker 2: 'Cause my father wanted to settle in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Any word as to how your [maternal] grandparents [Laura Battle Richardson and Plummer Alston Richardson] felt (laughter) about this?
Speaker 2: Well, I guess they got reconciled to it because my, 'cause they really liked my father.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 505828
Speaker 1: Let's go back a, a little to, so we can sort of get a sense of what he was like, Ernest Aaron Freeman [Ernest Freeman, Sr.].  How far back can you go with your--
Speaker 2: I remember my--
Speaker 1: --your father.
Speaker 2: I remember my grandfather just very vaguely.  I was very small when he came to visit, but I've heard so many tales about him.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your grandfather, what, what was your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Julius.
Speaker 1: Okay, Julius Freeman, or it was a middle name, or you may not know it?
Speaker 2: I don't know anything about a middle name.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I do know that he chose the name Freeman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: When Sherman [William Tecumseh Sherman], on his, on his march down to Georgia--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --when they came through North Carolina and freed the slaves, the plantation name was Saunders.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He, he took the name Freeman.  He was Julius Freeman.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, this was your great-grandfather [sic. grandfather].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And he was on the Saunders' plantation.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I think he was the oldest of two brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they all became Freeman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the, when Sherman marched through (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was about twelve years old.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: He was about twelve years old.
Speaker 1: Twelve years old, okay.  When, when he came through and he left freemen behind, even though it was not legally declared until the proclama- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The proclamation [Emancipation Proclamation], yeah.
Speaker 1: The, did he stay around that plantation, or did he move on someplace?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I really don't know.  I, I imagine he, he, I imagine he left--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'cause he was a very independent person.
Speaker 1: Good, good.
Speaker 2: But remember that he was--
Speaker 1: Twelve.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So he could--(laughter)--didn't want to go too far.
Story_ID: 505829
Speaker 1: Anything else you know about him [Julius Freeman] through that period following the Civil War, meeting your great-grandmother [sic. paternal grandmother] and so forth?
Speaker 2: That's quite a story there.  He--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --he'd had to, I think he had to, he, he had to walk forty miles Saturday night for the courting on Sunday.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And nine o'clock in the morning, of course, all the young fellows--(unclear)--she was supposed to be the prettiest girl in three counties.
Speaker 1: Wow, wow, so he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I, I just found out recently--I was at a family reunion, and I found recently that she was Choctalanian [ph.].
Speaker 1: Now what, what, Choc--
Speaker 2: Choctaw.
Speaker 1: Oh, Choctaw, right, right, Choctaw cribe--tribe.
Speaker 2: But she was supposed to be the prettiest girl in three counties.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he would have to leave from where he was, walk all the way there, and get there about six o'clock in the morning.  And he carried with him a piece of cornbread and a bacon rind.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So he'd stop by the stream and, and you know, get washed up and get the dust and stuff off of him, eat the cornbread, and slick his hair with the bacon rind.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay, so he'd be presentable?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And nine o'clock he was there, ready to stake his claim.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and the, the, the hard thing was he had to outlast all the other fellows.
Speaker 1: Because they were going to stake their claim also.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now what was your great-grandmother's [sic. grandmother] name?
Speaker 2: I think it was E--it began with an E, Elisha or Eliza [Eliza Freeman].
Speaker 1: Eliza.
Speaker 2: I think that's what it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Any other part of it?
Speaker 2: Hm?
Speaker 1: Any other part of the name that you remember--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --maiden name or anything (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, no, I don't; no, I don't.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And of course, your, your great-grandfather [sic. grandfather] was the stakes winner, a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: But you know, when he came to visit, visit, he didn't have anything to do all day 'cause my father [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] was working.  And he related all these stories to my mother [Gertrude Richardson Freeman].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of the things he said, that he was determined he was gonna marry a woman who didn't sing 'A Charge to Keep I Have' when she combed her hair.  He wanted a woman to 'Jesus, Lover of my Soul.'
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter).  And he found that woman in--
Speaker 2: Oh, he did.
Speaker 1: --your grandmother.
Speaker 2: And he did, he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And how many of those visits did it take before she--
Speaker 2: I don't know that, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I, I'm, I'm pretty sure it, you know, it wasn't done in a day.
Speaker 1: Right.  And, but there did come a time when they got married there.  And where did he and your great-grandmother [sic. grandmother]--
Speaker 2: They settled in Wilson [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: They settled in Wilson, okay.
Speaker 2: He was a builder, brick mason, stone mason, all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And how many children did they have?
Speaker 2: Oh, they had a bunch of 'em.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Good gracious, I don't know if I can name 'em all.
Speaker 1: Well, one was your, your dad.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was far, he was, he was far down the line.  I think there were two others after him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They must have had about nine or ten children.
Speaker 1: Okay.  See, in my family, that's a small brood (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: Nine or ten children, okay.  And so your dad--I'm sorry; we're not talking about your dad.  They, their children would be your grandfather.  One of them would be your grandfather.  What was your grandfather's name on your father's side?
Speaker 2: That was my grandfather.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.  So Julius Freeman was not your great-grandfather but your grandfather.
Speaker 2: My grandfather.  I don't know anything about the great, great-grandfather (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, okay, okay.  And they had nine or ten children, and one of them was your, your father.  And he was born around 1893.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as far as we can, a good guesstimate.
Speaker 1: A good guesstimate, right, okay--
Speaker 2: There may be, may have even been more than ten children, 'cause I, I remember there were three girls, and all the rest were boys.
Story_ID: 505830
Speaker 1: Well, they [Roberts' parents, Gertrude Richardson Freeman and Ernest Freeman, Sr.] got married in Chillicothe [Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then they--
Speaker 2: But there, there's a whole story before that.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, let's, let's go with that story.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  You have speed.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Well, my father decided he wanted to go to Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And then in the meantime, he had ordered a catalog, fifty cent catalog flute--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --a wooden flute--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and taught himself to play it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So he walked all the way from North Carolina to Tuskegee, Alabama.
Speaker 2: That's a walk.
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.  When he got, when he got there and told 'em where he come from, they, you know, welcomed him with open arms.
Speaker 2: Now this was before you and your mother--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I, I mean he--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and your mother got married.
Speaker 1: I imagine my, my father was probably in his late teens.
Speaker 2: Okay, teenager.
Speaker 1: And so they welcomed him in.  And as a flute player, he joined the band--
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: --the Tuskegee band.
Speaker 2: --at Tuskegee.
Speaker 1: And they traveled all over the country and raising money for the school.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Cleveland [Ohio] was one of the places they visited, and he liked Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Ah, okay.
Speaker 1: That's how they got to Cleveland.
Speaker 2: That's how they got to Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right, okay.  And he was one of nine, ten children.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there probably was more 'cause I know there were three girls and about five or six boys.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Now, when he met your mother, he, he was home from school, Tusk- Tuskegee or--
Speaker 1: No, he had, he was, had been out of Tuskegee for quite a while--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause he had worked in Atlanta [Georgia] in the post office for--
Speaker 2: Okay
Speaker 1: --a while.
Speaker 2: So, let's take him through Tuskegee.  Any experiences you, you can remember him telling you about there as a student at Tuskegee and traveling with the school band?
Speaker 1: No, not too much, but I just remember him saying one time that he went to try out for football.  It was just too rough (laughter).  Those guys were falling on cinders (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Oh, my goodness.
Speaker 1: --to toughen up.
Speaker 2: So, if--
Speaker 1: He--
Speaker 2: --he decided he wanted to be a flute player.
Speaker 1: It--well, he was a flute player, and he decided to stick with the band.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But the band did a lot of traveling.
Speaker 2: Right, right, and which was not uncommon in those days--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with schools such as Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] and Tuskegee and so forth.  Then there came a time when he finished Tuskegee?
Speaker 1: Yeah, he did.
Speaker 2: Okay--
Speaker 1: And then he passed the flue along to his younger brother [Daniel Freeman] who did the same thing.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.
Speaker 1: And his younger brother eventually became a professor at Tuskegee.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He was an artist.
Speaker 2: He was an artist?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They taught art?
Speaker 1: Yeah, at Tuskegee for years.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And his daughter [Elaine Freeman Thomas] is still there.  She's curator of the museum there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Wa- what's his name, the peanut man?
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: Carver (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) George Washington Carver.
Speaker 1: Carver.  I couldn't think of his name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 1: --yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: She's a cur- curator there of the museum, and she's quite an artist herself.
Story_ID: 505831
Speaker 1: Your father [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] though graduated from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do we know what year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But he did graduate from Tuskegee and he went following graduation, went to Atlanta [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: I imagine he went to other places too, but he finally wound up in Atlanta--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and worked in the post office there.
Speaker 1: All right.  And how does--is he working in Atlanta when he comes home to Nashville [North Carolina] and sees your mom [Gertrude Richardson Freeman]?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I really don't know that.  I don't know whether he was still working in Atlanta or not.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But there does come a time when he meets your mom.
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: And after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) at a little church picnic.
Speaker 1: At a little church picnic.  And after several dates, he's going, getting ready to go into World War I [WWI].
Speaker 2: Going into the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And instead of her going back to school at Cheyney [Cheyney Training School for Teachers; Cheyney University of Pennsylvania, Cheyney, Pennsylvania], they run off to Chillicothe [Ohio]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they get married.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And she then goes on to Cleveland [Ohio] to settle down, and he goes into the service.
Speaker 2: Yeah, as a flute player in the band, an all-black band.
Speaker 1: Ah, okay.  And he is assigned to be a member of the Army band.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Does he go overseas?
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --stationed in France.
Speaker 1: Stationed in France; and your mom is in, in Cleveland.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now he had a first cousin there in Cleveland.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I don't think they got along too well.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it was something about the North versus South culture (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.  But your mom doesn't go to stay with a cousin.  She goes to stay with, with who?
Speaker 2: I don't know just exactly what she did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But she did get a job at Sterling and Willis [sic. Sterling and Welch Co., Cleveland, Ohio], which was a very upscale house furnishing place.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: And you know, and I look back, I think it's because they thought she was white (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: 'Cause Cleveland--
Speaker 1: That helps.
Speaker 2: --Cleveland was very segregated.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Okay, so your father's in France, stationed in France.  And any experiences that you remember (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, he told--
Speaker 1: --him telling you?
Speaker 2: --he told the funniest stories.  I mean it, the way he told it, everything was funny over there (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.  So, he enjoyed that experience.
Speaker 2: Well, there was such a, a camaraderie, 'cause sometimes the fellows would come through there, had such a loud talking and back slapping and going on.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  And he stayed there until the end of the war?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know who he was stationed under, what his--

Speaker 2: By the time he came home I was born.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: But I look so much like my father (laughter), nobody raised any questions.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, your siblings, let's get those down on the record.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How many siblings do you--
Speaker 2: I had two brothers.
Speaker 1: Two brothers, okay, and their names.
Speaker 2: Ernest Aaron Freeman, Jr. [Ernest Freeman, Jr.].
Speaker 1: Ernest Aaron, okay, Jr.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he, was he the first born?
Speaker 2: No, I was.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, and then Ernest Aaron, the first boy born; and then the other one?
Speaker 2: Arthur Julian [Arthur Freeman].
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough, Free (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now it's funny how--
Speaker 1: --Freeman.
Speaker 2: --my mother [Gertrude Richardson Freeman] came by the, the name Arthur Julian.  She was thinking about her, her father, whose name was, of course, Plummer Alston [Plummer Alston Richardson].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, she didn't wanna name him Alston, so she picked Arthur.  That was, that was her rationalizate- rationalization.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then Julius, she didn't want to name him Julius, so she picked Julian.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the whole process of rationalization was really funny to me.
Speaker 1: Very interesting, very, okay.  And you did not have it--you were the only girl?
Speaker 2: Yeah.

Speaker 1: Let's talk about your growing up.  What are your earliest memories now as a baby and growing up?
Speaker 2: My father [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] took me with him everywhere--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as soon, I think as soon as I could walk.  And as a early black flute player in Cleveland [Ohio], he was very much in demand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But before that, (cough) when right after the war [World War I, WWI], Cleveland was booming in the, all the foundries, and it was a big manufacturing town.  Everything was booming.  Steel mills were going and lots of shipping--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --on Lake Erie.  And then about 1923 the bottom dropped out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, all the millionaires in Cleveland, of which there were quite a few--
Speaker 1: Now was your father's principal means of earning a living was playing, playing the flute?
Speaker 2: Playing music.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Not just the flute, but he also played the saxophone.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the sax.
Speaker 2: And so the black bands were hired to play at these wonderful ballrooms.  All those big mansions had the ballrooms on the third floor.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But when the bottom dropped out 'cause there was no work, that's when he decided to go to work at a foundry.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: So he went out to apply for the job, and the man looked at his hands and says you don't wanna work here.  He said mister, I have a wife [Gertrude Richardson Freeman] and a baby.  I need this job.  So the man says well, when can you start?  He says I can start right now.  I have my work clothes outside.
Speaker 1: Wonderful, he was ready.
Speaker 2: He was ready.  And he stayed there until he retired.
Speaker 1: Ah, so he got the job, and he stayed right there.
Speaker 2: And not only that, but when the World War II [WWII] started, my father had taken a lot of courses from, I think it was from one of the universities in Chicago [Illinois].  I remember he took correspondence courses.  He could estimate the weight of a load of iron to so many, you know--
Speaker 1: Ounce (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) millimeters.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: He was so good at that.  And in order to keep the, the other people, other men from messing up his orders, he would number them with Roman numerals, which of course they couldn't read.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: And when the war started, somebody from the Ernst and Ernst company [Ernst and Ernst; EY], they were famous for being--what did they call them--more than evaluators, but they went to the plant, you know--they had a name for 'em, and I can't, can't think of what the name is.  But anyway, he said he saw this man following him around, following him around.  And when the man wrote up his report, he, his, his suggestion was that my father be made foreman, to have a title of what he was already doing with of course more pay.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And that's how he became foreman.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they did follow the man's advice and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they did.
Speaker 1: --your father became a foreman at the--what is the name of the company?
Speaker 2: Acme [Acme Foundry Co.].
Speaker 1: Acme.
Speaker 2: Acme company.  They were a foundry.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But, but he, he became foreman of a job he was all, had all been, already been doing all these years.
Speaker 1: Right, right, so he was very fortunate on that.
Speaker 2: Well, if the war hadn't come along it wouldn't have happened.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Efficiency experts, that's what they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Efficiency experts.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: You're growing up in the Freeman household and--
Speaker 2: My dad [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] took me everywhere.
Speaker 1: Right, and your two siblings [Ernest Freeman, Jr. and Arthur Freeman] come along, two boys.  And does that change anything for you there in the house (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Not really at that time because my dad still took me around.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he go, everyplace he went that he played, and I'd sit right in the chair right next to him.
Speaker 1: Okay, even some of the clubs that away he had to play--
Speaker 2: No, he didn't play any clubs.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh.
Speaker 2: But he did--well, for instance, any time they needed an orchestra, he was always a part of it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Sunday mornings they had an orchestra at St. John's A.M.E. Church [St. John's African Methodist Episcopal Church, Cleveland, Ohio], which was the largest black A.M.E. church in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they had an orchestra that played for Sunday school.  So I, I would be sitting there every Sunday morning right next to him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they also had the Elks band [Improved Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he was director of the Elks band.  They had lots of parades.
Speaker 1: Okay, and so he--
Speaker 2: And I got a chance to march in the parade (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that--(unclear)--that was fun.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: It was a long time before I could actually sit still while a march was being played, you know, 'cause I knew all the marches--
Speaker 1: Right, right--
Speaker 2: --you know.
Speaker 1: --'cause you had been there with your dad.
Speaker 2: And I, I was just like the firehouse dog (laughter), ready to go.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Ready to go.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your earliest memories in the school system.  Did you start kindergarten there in Cleveland [Ohio] or--
Speaker 2: I did.  And since I started reading when I was four years old, I skipped the first grade.
Speaker 1: Ah, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: Now, tell us about the experience.  How did you--did your mother [Gertrude Richardson Freeman] purposely just sit you down and teach you to read so that you--
Speaker 2: No, I started going to the library with a little Jewish girl that lived behind us, and her name was Phyllis Benjamin [ph.].  And I guess I was little and cute.  She liked to take me around.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we, every Saturday we'd go to the library.  And to this day, I have a problem turning a page down in a book.
Speaker 1: Oh (laughter), okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) 'Cause it was so engrained in me, you know, they, 'cause they taught you how to take care of books and--
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: --by the time I was twelve, I had read anything in the local library.
Speaker 1: Ooh, now give us some, an example of some of the things that you were reading.
Speaker 2: I read books in categories.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I went through all the fairy tales.  I went through all the frontiersman books.  I went through all the scientific books.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  The, now this gave you a leg up in school.  In fact, it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) It did.
Speaker 1: --skipped you a grade.
Speaker 2: It did.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And then I went to summer school every year.  I loved going to school.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you, you volunteered for summer school.
Speaker 2: I went to summer--it was something to do, you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Went to summer school every summer.
Speaker 1: You must have been a joy for the teachers.
Speaker 2: Well, not in the beginning (laughter).
Speaker 1: The, some of the teachers that you remember and why you remember them.
Speaker 2: Well, my homeroom teacher in high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio] was Ms. Waterman [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay, let's go back to, though, that elementary school.
Speaker 2: Okay, I went to a school called John Burroughs [John Burroughs Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio], and it was right down the street from us.  And we lived right across the street from a big manufacturing place.  And the trains would come right by there, right, right behind the building right off, fact it, in front of our house.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Oh, boy.
Speaker 2: And they, they had a opening there where the, the cars would go in, and we're standing opening and waving at the engineering (laughter).
Speaker 1: And, and the teachers that time--
Speaker 2: And well--
Speaker 1: --they must have thought of you as some sort of prodigy since you read so well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not really because, well, one thing--I was in a class, when I went, went to the school, my mother took me to school and I didn't have any roses in my cheeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I've never had any roses in my cheeks.  If I was gonna have any roses, I had to put 'em there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But they, they decided that I'd really needed to be in what they call a fresh air thing.  And we had to, they had these heavy wool coats and hoods over their heads.  And we took naps twice a day, and they would have nutrition.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then all, also, they put me in a speech class, and I hated it.  But I'll tell you, I learned how to say guests (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Any particular teachers stand out that you were (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In elementary school?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: No, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Elementary school was miserable.
Speaker 1: Okay, why was it miserable?
Speaker 2: Well, 'cause I was such a inept kind of person.  I, I couldn't do math; I couldn't add two and two and much to the consternation of my mother, who could, what she say, she could do sums.  She could add whole columns of figures about as fast as she could do it on a calculator.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And I could not learn math, so I figured out it must have been they didn't present it to me right--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because they say music and math supposed to go together; not for me it didn't (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I think for a lot of people, not, not for them.
Story_ID: 505858
Speaker 1: Then Cleveland [Ohio] has the middle school system and then the high school, is that it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was junior high.
Speaker 1: Junior high.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: And what was junior high like, much the same or--?
Speaker 2: No, I kind of came to my own.  What happened is at, at, when we were leaving elementary school [John Burroughs Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio], we had, we had to take the IQ test.  I had sense enough to leave the whole math section alone, not even look at it--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and finished up all, finished up all the rest of the test.  But I was very well, well read by that time, you know.  I, I had finished up everything in, in the local library, and I was going downtown to the library.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And when the re- the test results came back, the teacher seated us according to our test scores, and I was third.  She was flabbergasted, 'cause I had never given any indication (laughter) that I had any capacity for learning.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I'll tell you, every time she would, every time she looked at me she shook her head.
Speaker 1: The, I know the Cleveland school system was not segregated, but it was--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't.
Speaker 1: --de facto--
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: --in them--
Speaker 2: --I saw--when I first went to--Central High [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio] had both junior and senior high schools in them.  And that, that was, Central High School was the oldest high school west of the Allegheny Mountains.  And they had a big clock tower donated by Rockefeller [John D. Rockefeller].  And when I first went there, the school was about half and half.  And by the time I finished at, at six years, it was practically all black.  But they put us in a special class.  And we had to take Latin (laughter), and that was--thank goodness for that, I had--that Latin was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I took six years of Latin--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and two years of French.  But Latin helped me so much because I under, made me understand English.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, the, the school that you were at, both in junior high--in fact, elementary, junior high, high school, the teachers, were they--because now we, we are up to 1942.
Speaker 2: No, I was out of--I graduated in '36 [1936].
Speaker 1: In '36 [1936]?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But--
Speaker 2: And I, and I was ahead of my grade.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So 19--I'd say--
Speaker 2: Thirty [1930].
Speaker 1: --thirty-four [1934] or thereabouts, what was the school system like?  Let me ask you that.  Were most--
Speaker 2: Oh, I had noth--
Speaker 1: --of the teachers white?  Were they black?
Speaker 2: We had--
Speaker 1: How were you, how were you treated?
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What was the makeup of your class?
Speaker 2: We--
Speaker 1: Let me start there.
Speaker 2: Okay, as, as I told you, when we, when I started high the school was about half and half, 'cause I can remember when they had the first class president was black.  There was a big brouhaha.
Speaker 1: Among who, the--
Speaker 2: Among the teacher and everybody.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the teachers--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the administration?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I remember his name; (unclear)--name was Monroe Salven [ph.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But after they put us in this special class, I kind of came into my own 'cause I was on the honor roll after that.  I was always on the honor roll.
Speaker 1: What was the special class about now?  Tell--when you say special class, what do you mean?
Speaker 2: Well, we had to take special subjects like Latin.  And they were--
Speaker 1: So was it, it was an advanced class?
Speaker 2: I, well, all the, all the people whose IQs were in the three digits.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they came from all over the el- all other elementary schools--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --not just my school.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so, all of the, the entire Cleveland school system had to take these--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --special classes, okay.
Speaker 2: Well, we did at Central.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we had very good, we had very good teachers at Central.  And I know they were very good because the minute they had a retirement cut off at sixty-five, and the minute those teachers had to retired they were snapped up.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: The French department was so good that people would come from all over the city to see the plays they put on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And our principal Latin teacher was Helen Chesnutt.  Does the name ring, ring a bell?
Speaker 1: No, it doesn't.
Speaker 2: She was Charles Chesnutt's [Charles W. Chesnutt] daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The, let me ask about the makeup--
Speaker 2: You know who's Chesnutt?
Speaker 1: No, I don't (laughter).
Speaker 2: He was one--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I was gonna leave it--
Speaker 2: --he was verse--first published black novelists.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, you're getting an education today.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Charles Chesnutt, look that up.
Story_ID: 505859
Speaker 1: The makeup of, of the teachers that were teaching you in elementary school [John Burroughs Elementary School, Cleveland, Ohio], junior high, high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio], what was that like, the racial makeup?
Speaker 2: We only had one black teacher; that was Ms. Chesnutt [Helen Chesnutt], and she wasn't really black.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And then Ms.--oh, what was her name?  She had a peculiar name.  It was a big, not celebration exactly, but it, it was a big to-do when she got into the school system.  And gradually, you know--in elementary school we had a, a, a black teacher, Ms. Cheeks [ph.], very beautiful woman, very mean.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but I would say 99 percent.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Did this, this didn't seem to make any difference, though, to the kids?  There, there wasn't--well, you said because it was 50/50.  That--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but as I--
Speaker 1: --that's where I was going.
Speaker 2: --got into senior high school, it gradually became less and less white students.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I do remember we had a German teacher, who taught tenth grade English grammar.  We had--she advised two of the students to wait until the next semester because the valedictorian for their class was definitely going to be black.  And she had to hold over so they could be valedictorian and, and salutatorian the next semester.
Story_ID: 505860
Speaker 1: So you're in high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio] now, and what are you thinking about your plans for going on to college or not going on to college?
Speaker 2: Well, my folks [Gertrude Richardson Freeman and Ernest Freeman, Sr.] had the plans.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they were, they were, they were definitely insisting on my going to college, so my mother had me go to the school counselor.  So the school's counselor wanted to know well, you know, why would you merit this special effort?  So I went home and told my mother what she had said.  We had been doing from the time I guess we were much, much younger, my father and my brother and I, 'cause I being the, the, the girl 'cause I stuck to the piano--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --my brother with the violin.  Well, we had a trio, and we performed just about every Sunday.
Speaker 1: Okay, now when you say your brother, you mean--
Speaker 2: Ernie [Ernest Freeman, Jr.] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) Ernest, right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Good enough, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause Art [Arthur Freeman] was too young at the time.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Speaker 2: And she kept a record of everywhere that we had performed.  So she gave me a whole pile of these notebooks to take back to the teacher.  She must have been impressed because from then on she made sure I got all the right classes, you know, for, for college entrance.  And then when I was ready to graduate she sent me everywhere, all the, all the immediate colleges.  And it was much different from my next door neighbor who went to an all-white high school.  The only places they sent her was Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was the only places that she was--
Speaker 1: But for you, you went to what schools (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) exposed to.
Speaker 1: What, what schools were you exposed to?
Speaker 2: I went down to Oberlin [Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio], 'cause that's where my mother wanted me to go.  And I got a--they gave me a sixty-five dollar scholarship (laughter), which wasn't gonna do me much good.  And out of the blue, like serendipity, a friend called and said they're holding scholarship auditions at the Cleveland Institute of Music [Cleveland, Ohio].  I didn't know anything about the Cleveland, and I don't even, I don't even think I'd heard of the Cleveland Institute of Music.  And it just so happened it was on a Saturday, and I was doing a concert, a recital actually, the Friday night and had invited, invited people, you know, was trying to raise money.  And so, I had a hard time pulling out to get to the concert, but I did.  I said oh, what, I might as well go.  So I went and got a $250 scholarship, which was half the tuition.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So that's where I went.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So what year was that that you went off?
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-six [1936].
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-six [1936] you went off to college.
Speaker 2: No, didn't go off.  I was right there in the town, just stayed at home--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and continued with my other activities.
Speaker 1: Oh, so, okay, so you stayed at home even though--
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay, because it was right there--
Speaker 2: Right there.
Speaker 1: --in the city, okay.
Speaker 2: All I had to do was, is get on the streetcar.
Speaker 1: Okay, and oh, and how many years did you attend?
Speaker 2: I graduated in '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And what were some of the experiences that you remember most?
Speaker 2: About the institute?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: They were, at that time, they were, they cla- holding classes at the Samuel Mather house [Mather Mansion, Cleveland, Ohio], the most beautiful house I ever seen.  They had wood, wonderful woodwork.  Everything was carved, and acorns, and oak leaves, and vines and stuff.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I'd never seen anything like that.  Of course, they had the obligatory ballroom on the third floor.  That's where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --we had the recitals and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and, and speak- and guest speakers coming in and stuff.
Story_ID: 505861
Speaker 1: So as a student, especially African American student, what was it like for you there [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That school was so wily- lily white it didn't even have a black janitor (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and what were some of the experiences that, that you--
Speaker 2: Well, the one thing I had that there are people there who were, who were better taught than I was 'cause I had taken lessons all that time from like the church organist, you know.  But I could sight read.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My father [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] and my brother and I used to sight read overtures every Sunday morning before going to Sunday school.  Our Sunday school was in the aft- in the afternoon.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the church that you were going to?
Speaker 2: St. James [sic. St. John's African Methodist Episcopal Church, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: St. James, right.
Speaker 2: That was another--that, that church was so prominent that we got two bishops out of St. James.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Anyway, they found out I could sight read, I was playing for the head of the voice department and head of the violin department.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: And that's how I made money to get through school, fifty cents an hour.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and I was paid by the government, NYA.  You remember the NYA?
Speaker 1: No, I haven't.
Speaker 2: National Youth Authority [sic. National Youth Administration].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was, that's, that was set up with, by Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt].  You know, that was the youth, youth organization like the WPA [Works Progress Administration; Work Projects Administration], only this was for young people.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: So I, I played--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --a lot of, I played a lot of hours.
Speaker 1: Right.  Any memorable experience, though, while at the institute?  If there are none, don't, don't worry about it.
Speaker 2: Memorable, I don't know.  I was there, and by that time I had--that's a nourish- 'nother story how I got into the swing band--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --the Evelyn Freeman Swing Band.  I was still doing that.
Speaker 1: At the institute?
Speaker 2: No, that was outside.
Speaker 1: Oh, this was after you had--
Speaker 2: While I was still in the institute
Speaker 1: Right, that's what--I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's what I meant--
Speaker 2: That was a--
Speaker 1: --while you were still in the institute.
Speaker 2: That was one of my outside activities.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's a, a swing band that you, that you organized and instituted.  And you, played throughout the Cleveland [Ohio] area?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and all through the, a northern Ohio area, went far as Youngstown [Ohio], Erie, Pennsylvania.  But, let me, let me go back again.  My teacher was Dorothy K. Price.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on for a second.  Let's let this plane pass.  Okay, you can start again with: "My teacher was."
Speaker 2: My teacher was Dorothy K. Price, and I realized now I re- I really didn't give her much because I, I was not, I was not a talker.  You know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I didn't show my feelings.  And I feel very bad about that, but you know, that was the way I was.
Speaker 1: Right, we are who we are.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But evidently, I was a good enough student for her to keep me all those--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then also I took, I may--I majored in piano, but I also minored in ear training.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I had perfect pitch, and that's a story how I learned I had perfect pitch.
Speaker 1: And you learned that as you, when you entered the--
Speaker 2: Nope, learned that just before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Every Sunday evening we would gather around the radio to listen to Major Bowes ['Major Bowes Amateur Hour'], eight o'clock.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I say gather around the radio, to look at the radio.  And one night this fellow came on, and they were oohing and aahing over the fact that he had perfect pitch, and I said well, what in the world is that, said I can do what he's doing, 'cause they went and played notes on the piano.  And he could name the notes and said I can't see why that's so great.  I can do that.  I went back to school Monday.  And my, 'cause my homeroom teacher was, was the music teacher, and so I, I was telling her, I said, "I can't see what the big deal is.  You know, they were talking about this guy, guy had per--." I can do that.  And she was a fluttering old maid anyway, and she always, she got so fluttery.  She had me go to the back of the room, and she was plucking notes on the piano.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And that's when I found out that there was something to have that perfect pitch.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And then my brother Ernie [Ernest Freeman, Jr.] had it.
Speaker 1: Oh, and Ernie had it also?
Speaker 2: He had it also.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did he go to the institute though?
Speaker 2: He did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He did.  I, I established a dynasty there.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I guess they figured they had a sub--had something in us Freemans.  And my younger brother graduated from there.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  But did he start there also?
Speaker 2: Who is that?
Speaker 1: Your younger brother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --Arthur [Arthur Freeman].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 505862
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He [Roberts' brother, Arthur Freeman] was going to be an engineer, and he--they wouldn't let him do that at East Tech [East Technical High School, Cleveland, Ohio] where he should have gone.  They wouldn't let him be an engineer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he said well--
Speaker 1: Now, when you say they wouldn't let him be an engineer--
Speaker 2: He couldn't take the courses.
Speaker 1: They would not allow him.
Speaker 2: Would not allow him to take the courses.
Speaker 1: And the reason, did they give a reason?  Did your parents [Gertrude Richardson Freeman and Ernest Freeman, Sr.] ever inquire or anything?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what the reason was.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know what the reason was, but I, I'm asking did anybody ever say it?
Speaker 2: No, because it, it, it--everybody knew what was, what was going on.  I mean, if it, if, if they didn't let you in this door, you went around to another door.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So they said well, I'll just go into music.  And he had, he had no problems getting into the institute [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we had already established the precedent.
Speaker 1: The, the Freemans.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Here comes a Freeman.
Speaker 2: Yes.  And he used to complain that one of his teachers always called him Ernie [Ernest Freeman, Jr.].  And so the teacher says, "You know, if I call you Evelyn [HistoryMaker Evelyn Freeman Roberts], you answer anyway."
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, let me add, let me ask you this: when you said your, your youngest brother graduated, does that mean that you and Ernest did not graduate?
Speaker 2: No, I graduated in '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ernie was there for two years and was inducted into the [U.S.] Navy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's another story.
Speaker 1: Okay, we will, we will get to that.
Speaker 2: But he finished at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --got his degree at USC.
Story_ID: 505863
Speaker 1: So you graduated from the institute [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio] in 1941.  And why don't we just go ahead and tell Ernie's [Ernest Freeman, Jr.] story, because the war is coming on, World War II [WWII].  And Ernie is in the, the institute, and he gets inducted or into the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: No, that's anoth- that's a whole nother story.
Speaker 1: Let's try to tell it.
Speaker 2: Okay, let me tell you a little bit about Ernie.  Ernie used to--Ernie was such a hyper person.  And I realize in later years it's because he ate the paint off the walls.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was a paint eater.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As, evidently, it didn't harm his brain too much 'cause he was a genius when it came to arranging.  But he was so hyper that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The lead, lead poisoning will do that.
Speaker 2: --that my, they would have him come south with my grandparents to give my mother [Gertrude Richardson Freeman] a rest.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was so, I was so envious 'cause he would come back with all these, all these exotic phrases like chuck the ball (laughter), stuff like that.  But it wasn't until I was grown, I realized that they sent him south so that my mother could get some rest (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Rest, right, right.
Speaker 2: But he started violin as a--Mr. Ginsberg [ph.] came to the neighborhood, and he was charging twenty-five cents a lesson and even had little violins for, for the young students.  And, and I, to this day, I, in my mind's eye, I can see my brother and Mr. Ginsberg just sawing away on-'When It's Springtime in the Rockies.'
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Well, now he had several students at the time he started because they all dropped out, all except Ernie.  I think God that he had the sense enough to realize that he had a gem here.  And it wasn't long before he reconin- recommended another teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a German by the name of Herman Fessler.  And of course, he played the violin and progressed so--
Speaker 1: We are in the '30s [1930s] with Ernie playing right (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: And so the three of us played together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And now up to that time, up to the time I graduated, I was strictly into classical music.  I didn't play anything else.  And we, and the, the three of us, trio, we played classical music, and we did all these performances and stuff around.  Well, we start--when Ernie got into high school, he was very popular, very charismatic and you know, just drew people to him, much different from myself.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: You were introverted.
Speaker 2: I guess I was (background noise)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --to a large degree (background noise).
Story_ID: 505873
Speaker 1: Now there was a point 'cause we're at the institute [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio], but there is a point that we had left out.  And let's go back and, and get that into the correct--sometime during junior high, perhaps high school, you started a group.  Tell us about it.
Speaker 2: Well, I didn't exactly start a group.  It was just my father [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] and my brother and myself.  We would play at these Sunday teas.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they, they were invariably presented at funeral homes.
Speaker 1: And the name of that group was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well--
Speaker 1: --or the, or the--
Speaker 2: It wasn't--
Speaker 1: --three of you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was just the Freeman family.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was called the Freeman family.
Speaker 2: Whatever they called us (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay (laughter).
Speaker 2: And the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Go ahead.
Speaker 2: --reason that, why they were giving the, the, these teas at the funeral homes, because the funeral parlors were beautifully furnished, appointed, and they had fabulous silverware, you know, with the, the coffee, tea service.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they had to--they could use, they had access to all the, all the, that beautiful stuff.  So the teas were very popular.  And we would play at these, these teas.  And this is how we got--my mother [Gertrude Richardson Freeman] always kept a record of everything we did.  So when I got ready to graduate, I could take these to my school counselor and show her that I had been involved in all of this stuff; and hey, community involvement.
Speaker 1: Now, the Freeman family, you played what instrument?
Speaker 2: Piano.
Speaker 1: And your father played?
Speaker 2: Flute.
Speaker 1: And Ernest [Ernest Freeman, Jr.] played?
Speaker 2: Violin.
Speaker 1: Violin, okay.  And there were clippings and rosters or program note booklets and so forth--
Speaker 2: Oh, I don't (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) that you had--
Speaker 2: --know whether, whether it was or not.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Unclear) that.  But mother had kept a record of everywhere we, that, that we played.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's what you showed to the institute.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there anything else you wanted to say about the--
Speaker 2: Well, when my brother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) trio?
Speaker 2: --went to high school, all of his friends, they started, they, they joined us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And pretty soon--and not only the one from his school but also from all over--
Speaker 1: When your brother, Ernest, when, when--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And all from, from, from the, from the community.  And we play, we played an instrument and some time played in the Freeman Ensemble.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was the largest the group ever--
Speaker 2: I think of a, around twenty people.
Speaker 1: Twenty people.
Speaker 2: That was a whole lot of people to get in our house.
Speaker 1: Right, right, but sometimes you, you played at the funeral homes, right?
Speaker 2: No, not with this big group.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But we gave concerts at different churches.
Speaker 1: At the churches.
Speaker 2: Yeah, uh-huh.
Speaker 1: All right.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) All classical music.
Speaker 1: All classical music.  And sometimes the group would be as large as twenty people?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we actually had a good violin section (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, wonderful.  And, and, and approximately how many people would be, would come to these concerts, classical music concerts?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a, we had a pretty good following.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Remember, there wasn't too much to go to.
Speaker 1: In those days.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You certainly couldn't go home and watch television.
Speaker 2: No, you didn't do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, 'cause the, the, the participants themselves, their parents would come and the relatives and friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 505874
Speaker 1: Now we're coming up to the place, back up to the place now where you're graduating from the institute [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 2: But before that, let's back up again--
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --to 1936.  I'm graduating, and I'm so far ahead I could have graduated in January when I was sixteen.  But I didn't want to graduate in January.  That's a bad time to graduate.  So I wanted to wait until June to graduate.  And so, in the meantime, I have this very light class load.  And kids are always going down, going onto the Palace Theatre in Cleveland [Ohio], and that's where all the big bands came to play.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I had never been.  And they always come back on Monday, you know, and give a detailed description of everything that went on.  So I was curious, and just happened the, the one day that, one Friday that I decided to skip school, Duke Ellington was playing.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: That completely changed my life, completely.  I was so enthralled when I heard that band.  And so after I heard the band, I went backstage and, and a lot of people milling around back there.  And you know, when you graduate they, you have these little calling cards, you know, with your name on it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I sent it up by the elevator boy, and Duke invited me to come up and see him.  So I did; I went up to see Duke.  Duke had his son with him, Mercer [Mercer Ellington].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I, I didn't have anything to talk about (laughter), you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But I just--and I remember asking Mercer if he was gonna be a musician, and he said, "Oh no, I'm gonna be an engineer," (laughter). And so I met Da- Duke many times after that, and I never did tell him but how he changed my life.
Speaker 1: Now why did Duke Ellington make such an impact?  What--
Speaker 2: It was just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) was it that impacted--
Speaker 2: --the music--
Speaker 1: Just his music.
Speaker 2: --and the way it sounded.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, that was when I decided right then and there I wanna be a bandleader.
Speaker 1: All right, okay.
Speaker 2: And that was a very important turning point in my life.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this was how long before you actually graduated from the institute.
Speaker 2: Oh, this is, this is when I was graduating from high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --nineteen thirty-six [1936].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I didn't graduate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So we're talking about five years--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --more--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --okay.
Speaker 2: --all my contemporaries, and there were some great musicians that came out of Cleveland [Ohio], you know.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Nobody wanted to be bothered with me.
Story_ID: 505875
Speaker 1: All right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But what happened was, and one of the things that kind of hurried it along, my brother Ernie [Ernest Freeman, Jr.], the violin player, found an old saxophone way back in the closet that belonged to my father [Ernest Freeman, Sr.].  It was an E-flat alto Buescher.  I don't even, I don't think they even me--make those kind of, that--he found that in, back in the saxophone and taught himself to play it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Loved that saxophone because it gave him the freedom of expression he didn't have with the violin.  And in playing the classical music, all of the brass players, in fact, everybody, had to play cues that for instruments we didn't have; like the clarinet players would have to play the oboe cues, and the brass would have to play French horn or whatever of the cues.  So therefore, I had a bunch of kids who could read music.  So I had, so I taken the brass section, and my burdit- my brother Ernie on first sax and a couple of more sax, and we had the bass player, got a drummer.  We had a swing band--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Evelyn Freeman Swing Band.  And in two years' time (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) But when did, when did you form the Evelyn Freeman Swing Band?
Speaker 2: That was formed out of the Freeman Ensemble.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we still had, we had two organizations going at the same time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you were still in high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio] you're saying?
Speaker 2: Nope, I was in, at the institute--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --by that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, when you formed the swing band.
Speaker 2: Well, when we actually got started, I guess it would be about, about 1938.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so we are, you're just in the first year or two--
Speaker 2: Second year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) at the institute?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: And we even played, we even played for a dance at the institute.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry?
Speaker 2: We even played for a dance at the Cleveland Institute [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: At the Cle- at the institute, okay.  I'm just trying to get us in the right chronology, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, you looked at it chronologically, yeah.
Story_ID: 505876
Speaker 1: So while you're at the institute [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio], the swing band [Evelyn Freeman Swing Band] is performing.  And you and your dad [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] and Ernest [Ernest Freeman, Jr.] are performing as a classical--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --music trio.
Speaker 2: No, we had done some of them; we had more instruments that joined them.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this is when more instruments had--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --had joined you.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, we, we played a concert one night at the same time the school had a concert, and we had all the best musicians.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So after that, the, the school made sure that we didn't bump heads on the concert nights.
Speaker 1: Right, right.  Let me ask you--so you had these two things going and came up to where you're ready to graduate.
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure they missed your musical talents (laughter) there.
Speaker 2: Well, I knew that it was mo- it wasn't any point in me going into classical music, because it, it just wasn't feasible at that time.
Speaker 1: What do you mean it wasn't feasible?
Speaker 2: There, there was no opening for you--
Speaker 1: Okay, you mean as (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) as a black play--
Speaker 1: --as a black person?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so what did you decide to do when you were graduating?
Speaker 2: Well, at that time, we were playing for two ballrooms, the band was, and broadcasting over at WTAM [WTAM Radio, Cleveland, Ohio], which was a NBC affiliate, so we were pretty hot stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But one night a [U.S.] Navy recruiter came in the ballroom and heard the band, and he invited them to join as a group, which was unheard of.
Speaker 1: To join the Navy band (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The Navy as a--no, to join the Navy as a group, the whole band.
Speaker 1: Right.  So you're saying that they would join the Navy as recruits, not necessarily as musicians?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, they joined as musicians as a band--
Speaker 1: Right, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: --intact.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And it became the first all-black Navy band in history--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --of the Navy.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, where did that leave you?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) It left me in the cold (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, they came and asked me, said, "What we're gonna do?"  I said, "Hey, you know, they're gonna take you one by one.  You might as well join as a group."
Speaker 1: Right.  So--
Speaker 2: And they were stationed in Peru, Indiana.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that, it was a remarkable group.
Speaker 1: Spell Peru 'cause I don't, I'm not familiar with that.
Speaker 2: Peru, Indiana?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Right on the Wabash River.  That's the biggest body of water they saw during the whole war.
Speaker 1: Okay, because I'm not familiar with that part of Indiana, that's why (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --I'm asking that for some of our listeners--
Speaker 2: But it, it was a wonderful group, because besides the marching band, they also had a string quartet within the band that played for of--officers' best.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then they had the swing band--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which my brother ran.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what did you do?
Speaker 2: I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Since you were not included in that?
Speaker 2: No, they made me an honorary member later (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 505877
Speaker 1: But I still had, I still had Oster's Ballroom [Cleveland, Ohio].  But instead of thirteen pieces, I had six pieces.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And some of the people that came through my six pieces--you remember Bull Moose Jackson?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do, I do.
Speaker 1: Uh-huh. And Benny Bailey?
Speaker 2: I don't remember--
Speaker 1: World-class jazz player, trumpet.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: He came, he came, wanted a, wanted a job.  He was very scruffy looking at the time and couldn't read music, but I had arrangements.  I had to teach him to read music--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --so he could play my arrangements.
Speaker 2: All right.  And you were playing at one of the ballrooms there in Cleveland [Ohio].
Speaker 1: Oster's Ballroom.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: It was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Spell Oster's for me.
Speaker 1: O-S-T-E-R-S.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I talked the old man Oster into opening up the ballroom on Sunday night, which was dark, 'cause it was a white ballroom.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And we opened it up, thirty-five cents a person.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And when you say it was a white ballroom, what, what, what do you mean at that?
Speaker 1: Nobody (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Many of the people, you know, much younger than either you or I won't know what you mean.
Speaker 1: Well, it meant that the ballroom was strictly for white people.
Speaker 2: Okay, and so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, both, both ballrooms we worked at were for whites.
Speaker 2: Okay, but Oster's brought in a black band on Sundays.  Is that it?
Speaker 1: I talked them into opening up on Sunday nights.
Speaker 2: And using a black band?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Us (laughter), in particular.
Speaker 2: Right, right, okay.
Speaker 1: But then when they went into the [U.S.] Navy, then I, I just, I, I just used six pieces.
Speaker 2: Right, but you still performed on Sundays?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And how long did you do that?
Speaker 1: I did that practically until I left Cleveland.
Speaker 2: And when was that?
Speaker 1: I left Cleveland I think in '44 [1944].
Speaker 2: Okay, so the war [World War II, WWII] was still going on.
Speaker 1: Not in '44 [1944].  The war--
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: --was over.
Speaker 2: Nope, it was on, still on 'til August of '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: August of '45 [1945]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, then I must have left Cleveland in '45 [1945].
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, that's good enough.
Story_ID: 505878
Speaker 1: You left August, let's say August of '45 [1945].  Why did you leave?
Speaker 2: I wanted to leave Cleveland [Ohio], period.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: I was ready to leave, and I had met my husband-to-be.  And--
Speaker 1: When did you meet him?
Speaker 2: He came to me because he wanted some arrangements.
Speaker 1: Remember when that was?
Speaker 2: It was after (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Approximately?
Speaker 2: --it was after the war [World War II, WWII].
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you wanted to leave Cleveland, but the fact that you didn't leave immediately gave you a chance to meet your husband?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So he invited me to come and listen to him sing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: Where did you go to hear him sing?
Speaker 2: There was a nightclub called the Bluegrass [ph.].  That was--I almost had the man's--Deering [ph.] opened that Bluegrass.  Dorothy Donegan played there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And so he, he invited me to come.  He was, he was performing there.  He'd just come off the road with a number of big bands include--I think the last band he sang was with Cootie Williams.
Speaker 1: I remember Cootie Williams.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was there when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now--
Speaker 2: --Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson was there.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The, your husband had just come off the road.  What, what was his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Tommy Roberts, Thomas S. Roberts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how did you two meet?
Speaker 2: He came to my house looking for me because he, he wanted to get some arrangements made.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And also he needed somebo- (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) So you had a reputation by then--
Speaker 2: Oh yeah.
Speaker 1: --of being an excellent arranger--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --even then?  Okay, good enough, all right.
Speaker 2: So, he invited me to come and hear him sing.  He also needed somebody to write down his songs he had in his head.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And one of the--and I think what really motivated that was one of the, one of the songs that he had been singing in it for musicians when they got in jam sessions was a tune called--and it was a Theloit-- Thelonius Monk recorded it as ''Round Midnight.'
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So I think that kind of motivated him to, to find somebody who could write his ideas down.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he came to your house and wanted to get you to come over to the Bluegrass where he was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And listen to him sing.
Speaker 1: --performing.
Speaker 2: To hear him sing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  We're gonna get every detail (laughter) of this meeting now--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because the people want to know.  History wants to know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I went to Bluegrass to hear him sing.  And of course, the women would just ooh and ah and going on.  So afterwards he said, "Well, what do you think?"  And I said, "Well, you don't sound too bad, but I can't stand to look at you sing," (laughter).  Well, he was so mad with me.  And so, and you know, people asked me today how in the world did you all stay together so long.
Speaker 1: Right.  I don't want you to skip over this thing.  So, after you made those comments, he--you left, and he was mad with you?
Speaker 2: But I didn't know it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I was just voicing my opinion.
Speaker 1: Exactly.  Okay, now what's the next episode in this--
Speaker 2: Well, he kept coming over (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) blooming love affair?  Okay, he--
Speaker 2: He kept coming over, yeah.
Speaker 1: --he, he swallowed his pride--
Speaker 2: He kept coming over.
Speaker 1: --and came over to the house again (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I actually did write some of his ideas down, yep.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Some of the pieces that you arranged for him, do you remember?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But one of the songs that I did write down for him I still play today.  It's a beautiful melody.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was that?
Speaker 2: The song he called--I don't even remember the words to it anymore--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'Between This World and You.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But it was a beautiful song, and I still play it.
Story_ID: 505879
Speaker 1: So now, instead of your leaving Cleveland [Ohio], you're sticking around.
Speaker 2: Well, I was about to leave.  I had bought bus tickets.  I was going to Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And he [Thomas S. Roberts] talked Reverend Settle [Glenn T. Settle] into hiring me as an arranger for Wings Over Jordan [Wings Over Jordan Choir].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They were going to New York [New York] and make a town hall debut for Easter, and they wanted to, they real, really wanted to put their best foot forward.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now they had never had an arranger.
Speaker 1: Okay. So are we talking '46 [1946], '47 [1947] now?
Speaker 2: It would have to be '40--end of '45 [1945], beginning of '46 [1946].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so you went to New York?
Speaker 2: Went to New York.
Speaker 1: And started arranging for Wings Over Jordan.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  The first place we played was Madison Square Garden [New York, New York].  And then when they had their Easter town hall debut, I arranged several spirituals for them.  Now I had never arranged for, for vocals before.  That was new to me, and they had never had an arranger before.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But when they, when they did the, the concert, all the big shots from CBS were there, a lot of important people.  I got so many accolades for my work that the, the group started to put me out (cough) excuse me.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, so you are quite acclaimed for the arranging, vocal arrangements that you've done for Wings Over Jordan.  And still yet, though, there's no sign that you two recognized, you and your husband, Thomas Roberts--not your husband but your friend at that time--are moving toward anything romantically serious.
Speaker 1: Well, the proximity on the road I think did it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  You went on the road with Wings Over Jordan, and the proximity on the road.  Now besides the acclaim that you're getting from all over the country for your vocal arrangements, what, what is happening between you and Thomas?
Speaker 1: Well, we made a romantic connection there.  And I, like I said, I think it was the proximity--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --because that, that was not my intention when we started out (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) 'Cause you didn't like him.  Go ahead.  But--
Speaker 1: But any (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) somewhere--
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, they, they got--the, the divas in the group--started to work to, to mix--to get me out of there.  So when I was fired, I think they thought that they'd get rid of me and Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts] was gonna stay.  And that's not what happened.
Speaker 2: What happened?
Speaker 1: We left together.
Speaker 2: You left together.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: He said if, if you're firing her--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --I'm gone.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: And so we left, we left I think it was Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  And the funny thing is, the whole choir came down to see us off, and even, even the Reverend Settle.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: They all came down to see us off.  I'll tell you, it was something (laughter).
Speaker 2: Goodbye and, but sorry to see you go.
Speaker 1: They were, I think they were generally sorry to see us go--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --'cause they, they gave us a send-off.
Story_ID: 505880
Speaker 1: And we, we went right straight to New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Okay, and what did you do there in New York?
Speaker 1: Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts] had a cousin in New York, and we stayed with his--stayed there a few days.  I don't think his wife was too happy, and they found somebody who had, who had a room.  And she was in domestic service, only came in on Thursday, so that was perfect for us.  And she had a piano.
Speaker 2: Right, right, okay.  And so the two of you--did he find a dis- work again there in New York or--
Speaker 1: Yeah, we were very fortunate.  One of the things we did, one of the first things we did was to go to CBS.  And the first thing that this old lady asked us was did we do German lieder.  Now we're coming from Wings Over Jordan [Wings Over Jordan Choir], now what--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Right.
Speaker 1: --what's with the German lieder?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I was, I was so disgusted with that woman.  But we met Dave Fox [David Fox], who was head of AGVA [American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA)], variety artist, and he took a liking to us and introduced us to everybody.  And one of the things he introduced us to was they were doing vaudeville at the theaters on the weekends, Loews Theaters [AMC Theatres] and the RKO [RKO Radio Pictures, Inc.] theaters.  And so we had, we, we were working the theaters.
Speaker 2: So you did vaudeville?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: What, what was the act?
Speaker 1: It was just him and me and the orchestra.
Speaker 2: What--
Speaker 1: He was singing.
Speaker 2: Singing, okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And boy, I, I learned to arrange in a hurry, 'cause each week we would have to have different music.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you had--you didn't know what the orchestra was gonna be like, you know.
Speaker 2: You mean you didn't know who the orchestra was going to be at all?
Speaker 1: It didn't matter who the orchestra was.  It was a matter of their level of playing.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And, and some were better than others.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.
Speaker 1: But I, one thing I learned to do and, and, and was, I could, I had my music so that it could be played by a big band or a small combo.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: And that was something.
Speaker 2: Okay, are we into 1946--
Speaker 1: Well, it was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) or '47 [1947]?
Speaker 1: --we got there, we got to New York in '46 [1946], the fall of '46 [1946].
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, and you're doing vaudeville acts.  And what happens next in your career?
Speaker 1: We got, we got--we moved up to the big hotels like The Pierre [New York, New York] and the Waldorf [Waldorf Astoria New York, New York, New York] roof and--
Speaker 2: When you say moved up for the audience--
Speaker 1: We did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) you, you started playing those, those places?
Speaker 1: We, yeah, we played what they called club, club dates.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then in the summer we would go, we would play the ho- in the Borscht circuit up--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the Catskills [Catskill Mountains].
Speaker 2: Catskills, okay.  And so you're moving along with your career.  We're in '47 [1947] now, and you're still doing the hotspots, the top of the Waldorf, and in the summer the Borscht--
Speaker 1: And we connected with Sy Oliver.  I remember because '47 [1947] was the time that they had that big blizzard, and it wasn't a thing moving but the subway.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And, and Tommy--doing Sy Oliver, singing with his band and recorded a few times with Sy Oliver also.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: And, and Sy Oliver was always able to get the best musicians--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --so he had a good band.
Speaker 2: He did that right up until the end.  Okay, we're going to take you to the next step.  Right now we're in the winter, late winter, '47 [1947], and we're gonna move into '48 [1948].
Story_ID: 505888
Speaker 1: All right, we're gonna just regress one more time here.  And there was a point in which you were at the institute [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio], or you're graduating, getting ready to graduate from the institute when Cupid flew down and shot an arrow, and you thought you were in love.
Speaker 2: Well, I was working at the Karamu House [Playhouse Settlement; Karamu House, Cleveland, Ohio].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And they, they had a whole bunch of actors there.  You know, they put on these plays, and I was a part of that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I taught music at the Karamu House--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --and my husband was a potential actor.  He was very good but no get-up-and-go.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: Lloyd Gentry.
Speaker 1: Lloyd Gentry, okay.
Speaker 2: And at the--
Speaker 1: But you, how did you two meet?  You just met there?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you decided--
Speaker 2: Well, it was the first time I'd ever been in love.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, that was that hormones racing and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: But the problem with him was, 'cause I was making good money, I could make more in a night than he could make in a week.  And I--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I think that, that, that's bad on anybody's marriage.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Now what year was this the two of you got, got married?  Do you know?
Speaker 2: Let me think.  Let me think--(unclear).  It would have to be '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: Forty-one [1941], right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the--you had a few children.  How many?
Speaker 2: Three children.
Speaker 1: Three children; their names?
Speaker 2: Anita [Evelyn Anita Roberts], Ernest [Ernest Roberts], and Claire [Claire Roberts].
Speaker 1: Ernest after your brother, Ernest [Ernest Freeman, Jr.]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  C-L-A-I-R-E.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.  And that's, that's in order of the oldest first?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: And Claire being the youngest?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  But now you go to--oh, you, you and Lloyd break up in Cle- in--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I, I really instituted that 'cause he wouldn't have broken up.  But you know, he did, he did the unpardonable sin.
Speaker 1: Okay, and by--
Speaker 2: He spent my money (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, oh my (laughter).
Speaker 2: Nobody spends my money.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  That was the big sin.
Speaker 2: That was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The big S.
Speaker 2: --the unpardonable sin.
Speaker 1: I got you.  The, and a little after that, you, you meet Thomas [Thomas S. Roberts] and--
Speaker 2: Well, by that time I had put my children in the system--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because I was getting ready to get out of town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I was getting ready to leave.
Speaker 1: When you say put the children in the system, what do you mean by that?
Speaker 2: Foster home.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.
Speaker 2: And they were fortunate enough to get a very loving home--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --very loving.  And I got them set, and I said well, I'm out of here.
Speaker 1: Right, right (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But then the Wings Over Jordan [Wings Over Jordan Choir] came along, and that's--took me in a whole 'nother direction.
Story_ID: 505891
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts] and I got married in '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now, you're back in, in New York [New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In New York.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: Oh, let, let, let me add a, add something to that, to the Gentry [Lloyd Gentry] saga.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was, his first was Minnie Gentry, the actress.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And his grandson would be Terrence Howard.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So Claire [Claire Roberts] is Terrence Howard's aunt--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --great aunt I guess it would be.
Speaker 1: It's, it, I mean, let me get this straight.  Lloyd Gentry, his first wife was--
Speaker 2: Minnie.
Speaker 1: --Minnie Gentry.  And--
Speaker 2: They had a daughter, and I'm trying to think of what her name, what her name is.  But her fir- his--(unclear)--named her daughter Anita [Anita Williams], after my daughter.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And Anita is Terrence Howard's mother, so Claire would be Anita's aunt and would be Terrence's great aunt.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  I want to get this: Terrence Howard's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So listen--
Speaker 1: --mom, got you.
Speaker 2: --there's no reason why he wouldn't be an actor (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right (laughter), right, so he came, comes from great acting genes.  You, you said Lloyd was an excellent actor.
Story_ID: 505893
Speaker 1: But anyway, you left; you went with Wings Over Jordan [Wings Over Jordan Choir]; you then come back to New York [New York].  And you and Thomas [Thomas S. Roberts] are really doing well.  You're playing the top spots, the Waldorf Astoria [Waldorf Astoria New York, New York, New York] and all of that.  And there comes a time when you are, well, you, you're, you're finding out that--you and Thomas get a place together there--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in New York.
Speaker 2: --we moved away from where we were in, in, in Manhattan [New York]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and got a place over in the Bronx [New York], Brooklyn [New York].  And the lady was saying to the, the agent: I have a house I've got to sell.  And Thomas says how much you want for it (laughter)?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: She wanted seven thousand dollars for the house.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: And so what we did, we got four thousand from my parents [Gertrude Richardson Freeman and Ernest Freeman, Sr.] and bought the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was in the, in the Bronx--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --on 163rd Street.  There were three little houses, and we had the one on the end, big black- big backyard--
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: --three stories including the basement--there were four stories with the basement.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we were able to rent out the top two floors.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And we lived on the first floor and the basement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when was this that you bought that house?  Do you remember?  'Cause you and Thomas got married in '47 [1947].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it before--
Speaker 2: It would have to be--
Speaker 1: --or after?
Speaker 2: It would, oh, this is after--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --way after.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: It would have to be about '49 [1949] I guess.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Then--
Speaker 2: Then we were able to send for the kids to come to New York.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that I had another daughter, Lisa [Lisa Roberts], born in '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No, it would have been in, it would have been in '48 [1948].
Speaker 1: Okay, Lisa born in 1948.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then the next year you bought the house?
Speaker 2: No, bought the house in the same year Lisa was born.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: It's hard for me to get these years together.
Speaker 1: Oh, I know, I know it is.  I have no problems with it, you know.
Story_ID: 505895
Speaker 1: So by (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And, and during this period, '47 [1947], '48 [1948], you and Thomas [Thomas S. Roberts] are still playing some of the top spots.
Speaker 1: And Tommy was traveling with Sy Oliver.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: (Unclear) you know, you, you had the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], the Howard [Howard Theatre, Washington, D.C.], and what was the one in Baltimore [Maryland]?  Was it the Regal [Regal Theater, Chicago, Illinois]?
Speaker 2: No, the Regal was in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: Chicago, that's right.
Speaker 2: The top--what was it?  It was--I know the Howard was in D.C. [Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 1: D.C., but there, there were three of them you played together.
Speaker 2: Right, right, okay.  And you were singing.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was just going along for the ride (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right (laughter), all right.  But you were still arranging.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but not for Sy Oliver.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: He did his own arranging.
Speaker 2: He did his own arranging, right?
Speaker 1: (Nods head).
Speaker 2: Right, okay.  So now we--Lisa [Lisa Roberts] is born and you've gone into that house [in the Bronx, New York].  You're still traveling on the road or are you--
Speaker 1: Yes, we were.  Yes we were because we had the top, two top floors rented out.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And we had somebody who looked after it while we were gone, and--
Speaker 2: So you had the freedom to, to travel.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and--
Speaker 2: And you had sent for your, the three children.
Speaker 1: And we took the children on the road with us.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.
Speaker 1: They also, by the time Lisa was three, Tommy had put the, the four children and taught them to sing and dance.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And they, they--
Speaker 2: Let, let me go to that date.  Lisa was three in 1951.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So you taught all of the children to sing and dance, okay.  Go ahead.
Speaker 1: And they worked, they worked with us in the, in the Borscht circuit.
Speaker 2: Ah, okay.
Speaker 1: And Jewish people love children.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: So you know we were a big hit (laughter).  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And--
Speaker 1: --we, we were all, we always were just before the closing act because it was always the comedian, the comic.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and we were in one of the big hotels.  I can't think of the name of it right now but one of the top hotels.  And Joey Bishop had to follow us.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 1: I came by his dressing room, and he was cussing us out for a fare-you-well (laughter).  They say you don't follow--
Speaker 2: In a friendly way he was cussing you out.
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't friendly.
Speaker 2: It wasn't friendly.
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't friendly.  And I didn't say a word.  I kept going.
Speaker 2: Now why was he cussing you out?
Speaker 1: Because he had to follow.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: You don't, you don't follow kids, monkeys, and dogs.
Speaker 2: Ah, okay, I didn't know that.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay.  So--
Speaker 1: Or they--
Speaker 2: Now he blamed it on you instead of blaming it on the manager?
Speaker 1: What can I tell you?
Speaker 2: All right, all right.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And sometimes, some, some of the acts would, would ask us: would you, said would you please join us on the stage, you know, when they first come out--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --kind of take the edge of (laughter).  We didn't mind.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  Okay, now--
Speaker 1: But Lisa was the best one of the group.
Speaker 2: Ah, she was?
Speaker 1: She was terrific.  By, by, by the time she was four, she was signing autographs.  And we were at one place, and a fam- and a man, man and his wife came up there.  The little girl, they were carrying her, and evidently the child was autistic.  And they had tears running down their eyes.  It was the first time she'd ever said, said anything, soon as she saw the kids performing.
Story_ID: 505896
Speaker 1: So they [Roberts' children] only performed with you when you were on the Bor- Borscht Belt?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and then we did some television show, had the kids on with us.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, what are some of the television shows you did?
Speaker 2: We did 'Live Like a Millionaire' and some others.  I, I don't even remember the names of the them.  But they--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --this, the big studios had just gotten into television.
Speaker 1: All right, all right.  The, so now we're going into the '51 [1951] and '52 [1952], and the kids are, are, are in act in, in themselves.  And--
Speaker 2: We even had a big, big spread in the Jet magazine.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.  And you still have a copy of that?
Speaker 2: I have it someplace--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I wish I could put my hands on it.
Speaker 1: Not a problem, not a problem.  And now the kids are getting older.  Lisa [Lisa Roberts] is getting ready for formal school.  Do you keep her on the road with you and--
Speaker 2: They went to school wherever we were.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: When we were in Canada--because we, we'd work from two to six weeks at one spot.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, so there was time for, for them, all right.
Speaker 2: They got a great education.
Speaker 1: Right, right, it sounds like it.
Speaker 2: The one thing they learned was they didn't have time to fool around.  When they got into the school, they had to get right into the studies (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The studying and everything.  Any important events or incidents that we should know about during that period when they're all traveling, all of you are traveling together?
Speaker 2: No, we had two, two cars.  We traveled in two cars, two Chryslers.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: And one was a newer Chrysler they called Ms. Elizabeth, and the other the called Old Betsy.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: The musicians called, traveling in the other car.
Speaker 1: Who, who did the driving?
Speaker 2: Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts] did.
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: I didn't drive at that time.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause you don't drive in New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Yep, that's true, that's true.  But he drove one of the cars.  Who drove--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the other?
Speaker 2: You know, I don't remember this (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay.
Speaker 2: --but one of the musicians did, yeah.
Speaker 1: So as we moved along on that, where is the next stop that we need to note in, in your biography?
Speaker 2: We were doing very well because we could sit home and wait for the gigs.
Speaker 1: Right, because you were a popular group, and everyone knew you now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and--
Speaker 1: And you had the television exposure.
Speaker 2: Well, not so much that but you know, word of mouth--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --among the agents.  They knew who, who was--although we had problems with them too--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because they were very prejudiced.
Speaker 1: Give me an incident of what you're--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: Oh, they would always all say, "Oh, what I could do for you if you weren't colored."  Use, used to make me so mad, I said to one of, said if you weren't colored, you wouldn't want, you wouldn't have anything to sell (laughter).  They didn't like me for that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Good point. Good point.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and this is very true.
Speaker 1: Right. But anyway, you were coming along in the years, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and the agents would send us out to clubs that were having problems.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We'd get there and get the club back on their feet, and as soon as we did that, they'd hire a white actor to come in (laughter).
Speaker 1: To come in, right.  Nothing new though.
Speaker 2: I know, know.  And one, and one, one--we were working in Rochester [New York].  We were working in Rochester quite a bit.  And when we were with General Artists [General Artists Corporation; ICM Partners], I think at the time, and so a girl came in the club who was with General Artists.  And so, you know, she'd be with the same artist, so I--she wanted to sing, so I let her sing, and played very nicely behind it.  The owner put us out of the club and hired her.  So we went to another club, and we came back about three weeks later and that club had folded (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well--
Speaker 2: No better for him.
Speaker 1: --justice.  That's right.
Speaker 2: No better for them.
Story_ID: 505897
Speaker 1: How long did the kids, you know, go on the road with you?
Speaker 2: They were on the road with us until we left New York [New York].
Speaker 1: Okay, when, when was that?
Speaker 2: In 1956.
Speaker 1: Okay, 1956, all right.  And the, where, where did you go when you, when you left New York?
Speaker 2: Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: All right, all right, so you came out here.  And what brought you out here?
Speaker 2: My brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was, my brother Ernest [Ernest Freeman, Jr.], he was, Ernie, he was just on the verge of getting into big time arranging.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And he kept calling me and calling me: "You got to come out here; I need help; I need help."
Speaker 1: And he was arranging at that time for the Sinatras [Frank Sinatra] and--
Speaker 2: He hadn't, he hadn't gotten into the Sinatra bit yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But he was on the verge.
Speaker 1: He was on the verge, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, one night, one time he called and I just threw out a figure.  You know, I figure it shut him up.  I said, "You know, it would cost us money to close up our house and stuff."  So he said, "How much would it take?" So I just threw out a figure, said, "Oh, maybe a thousand dollars."  The next day here comes the money-gram.  So I said to Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts], "Well, what will he do--what, what are you gonna do?"  He said, "We're gonna pack up and leave."
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Get on the road.
Speaker 2: Pack up and leave, in which we did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you came out here to Los Angeles.  And what were some of the things?  You were helping Ernest mostly.
Speaker 2: Worked on the music with him.  And at that time he really hadn't paced himself, so he was always last-minute.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we'd be in it, in his big blue station wagon.  Tommy would be driving, and we'd be in the back seat trying to finish up the music.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Okay.
Speaker 2: And if we hadn't finished by the time we got to the studio, I would hide in the back of the studio and finish it up while he recorded what was already done.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: That was kind, that was kind of nerve-wracking.
Speaker 1: Wow.  And the kids were in school out here, wasn't--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and out here.  So we move on up to the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Well, you know when they (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you're doing pretty good.
Speaker 2: --when they, when they got in, when the people all--they said well, when your children going to school, they'll probably be put back.  But they weren't.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: They went right into their regular grade.
Speaker 1: So they were ready?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's good.  That, that, that's, that's good.
Speaker 2: I had two of them that went to Dorsey [Susan Miller Dorsey High School, Los Angeles, California], and one went to Mount Vernon [Mount Vernon Junior High School; Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Middle School, Los Angeles, California], and Lisa [Lisa Roberts] went to Virginia Roads School [sic. Virginia Road Elementary School, Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 505898
Speaker 1: Let's go to now the, what Hollywood [Los Angeles, California] was like, some of the challenges being faced out here by people in your business (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Very prejudiced. The union was very prejudiced, although they had been amal- amalgamated for a number of years, 'cause I know I went and talked to a few of the business agents, you know, that handled the clubs (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --different clubs.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Boy, I couldn't even get a foot in the door.  It was so funny years later that we were working at all the clubs we had been denied--
Speaker 1: Right.  And--
Speaker 2: --just from reputation.
Speaker 1: And, and the unions, of course, they weren't about to give in.
Speaker 2: Well, they were (unclear) amalgamated at that time, but they, they, they wouldn't give you the best jobs.
Speaker 1: Right, right, because this was in the '60s [1960s] and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that, I know they were--
Speaker 2: A whole lot different from New York [New York], a whole lot, because when we were in New York, we worked Cafe Society [New York, New York]; we worked Club Elegant [ph.] in Brooklyn [New York], and Town and Country in Brooklyn.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and you know, it wasn't the same.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.  So what, what did you do?  Where were you successful?
Speaker 2: I was in the record industry, industry myself about fifteen years.
Speaker 1: Okay, when, when did you start?  Out here?
Speaker 2: Out here.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what label were you associated with, what labels?
Speaker 2: All labels.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause I was working with my brother [Ernest Freeman, Jr.], and then I did things on my own (cough).
Speaker 1: All right.  And so in the record industry, were things any better than they had been?
Speaker 2: Not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: A lot of times I was the only black on the session or the only woman.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: And (laughter) a lot of times the guys in the booth, the suits--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --they'd see me sitting there: "She's playing the, she's playing the wrong thing; she's playing--," and the conductor says, she's not even playing now.  It's not her time to play yet (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Right, okay, okay.  So, did you come to a time when you thought things were beginning to get better?  In other words, around '65 [1965] or--
Speaker 2: Nah.
Speaker 1: Nope, none?
Speaker 2: We worked with big stars in, in Las Vegas [Nevada].  And you know, we couldn't get booked anyplace else in Las Vegas for the simple reason that, if the club, if the hotel booked us, they couldn't get the other acts from the agents.
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean they would say well, if you hook, if you booked the black group, we're gone?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so, what did you do?
Speaker 2: The first time we went to Las Vegas, and just funniest thing, every time we went to Las Vegas is because they needed us.  Yep--
Speaker 1: They needed you more than--
Speaker 2: --they needed--
Speaker 1: --you needed them?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they needed us because they, they're either on the last legs or they wanted the best show they'd ever done or whatever.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: The first time we went to Las Vegas, we went there for Major Riddle who owned the Dunes Hotel [Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He had made a bet with his pit bosses that he could get to Los Angeles [California] and get a, and find and bring back a group that would just tear everything up.
Speaker 1: Okay, and did he?
Speaker 2: We--when we--the first time, the first night we opened, opening, boy, Major Riddle went--(unclear)--he had on a--I'll never forget that.  He had on a white suit, a light colored suit, white, whatever.  He grabbed Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts] up--and he was a big man--grabbed Tommy up and--(unclear)--all around, all around the, the casino.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, bragging.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we were playing opposite the Dukes of Dixon and which was a known group.
Speaker 1: Okay, so it was a huge success?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It liked to kill me though.  We worked from six o'clock to--from twelve o'clock to six.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ooh, those long hours.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I'd get home just in time to get the kids off to school.
Story_ID: 505899
Speaker 1: Now we're getting up to the '70s [1970s].  We are looking--
Speaker 2: A lot more happened in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 1: Okay, tell me.
Speaker 2: Well, we did, not only did we do shows with Steve Allen, television show, Steve Allen, in '50--I guess it was about '57 [1957] or '58 [1958]--what is that big agency? They're--the comics are always making jokes about?  Anyway, they put us with Peggy Lee, and Peggy Lee had a reputation for missing shows.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she was very friendly person--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but very insecure.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we went up to her house to rehearse, and boy, she lived up on Summit, Summitridge Road [sic. Summitridge Drive, Beverly Hills, California].  And she would serve us whiskey in them big buckets like this.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: It's a wonder we didn't kill ourselves coming off that hill (laughter).  But in, anyway, we got that on the reputation on the record that we had done, 'Didn't It Rain.'
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the way we did 'Didn't It Rain,' we had a record company who was going to the studio--through the television--not television--the stereo convention in Chicago [Illinois].  And they wanted something that was gonna blow the, blow everything away, and they got it.
Speaker 1: They got it. 'Didn't It Rain.'
Speaker 2: So they put it out as a single, and then they wanted to make an album, which we did.  And that record went all over the world.  It was even banned in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause kids were dancing to it (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And the record, it was a little record company called Bel Canto [Bel Canto Recordings], up there on La Cienega [Boulevard] and Washington [Boulevard].  And he sold out everything and retired to Mexico.  And we never got a penny.
Speaker 1: Is that right?
Speaker 2: Never got a penny.  But on the strength of the, on the strength of the 'Didn't It Rain,' we not only sang background for Peggy--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but we also had a feature spot on her show.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And she didn't miss a show--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --not one.
Speaker 1: So they had some insurance when they hired you as background.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And they didn't miss a show.  And she was so insecure that when she would leave the, the, the stage after, you know, after the show was over, her entourage would be patting: "Oh, Peggy, you were so great."  She'd turn around and look at me to see what I thought.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And if she did a good show, I would nod my head, and then she'd go along be happy.  If she didn't do a good show, I wouldn't say anything (laughter)
Speaker 1: She, she knew the signal.
Speaker 2: That was really--and, and--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --her, her people, the manager's thing, they evidently thought that all she needed was a black group behind her, because she did the Hollywood Bowl [Los Angeles, California] and didn't invite us.  They put together another black group.  But what they didn't know was that I was, I had changed all the music to make it more singable.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, I was changing music almost to the last day (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: But I kept all the music I had changed and gave 'em back the originals.
Speaker 1: And what happened?
Speaker 2: Very sad (laughter); we went to see, we went to the bowl to see what was going on.  And boy, she hadn't had a black group; she hadn't had any kind of group since (laughter).
Story_ID: 505900
Speaker 1: We're in 1970.
Speaker 2: Okay, don't get to 1970 yet.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We haven't mentioned our four Jonathan Winters shows ['The Jonathan Winters Show'] and 'The Ed Sullivan Show'--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the Andy Griffith ['The Andy Griffith Show'] special.
Speaker 1: Go ahead and, and, and mention those.
Speaker 2: You know what I was telling you before, they only call us when they need us?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: 'Jonathan Winters Show' was about to be canceled.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And a friend of Barry Sullivan, who was a good friend of ours, had seen us 'cause we were, and we had the group at Barry's house.  They got a chance to swim in his pool and all that kind of stuff.  He was one of the writers on the show.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I, I--he must have brought us up, 'cause when they mentioned the Young Saints, he knew exactly who we were, you know.  So we went on the show for the--the first show they had more mail than any other single act in CBS history.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: People wanted--wrote in on wrapping paper (laughter) and--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --paper bags.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But the gist of the things was they were so glad, glad to see han-wholesome-looking young people rather than those long-haired pill pushers.
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: So then we were booked for three more shows.  But the bandleader, who was Percy Faith--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --gave me a hard way to go, because his, his arranger was Johnny Mandel, who was quite famous.  And he wanted John wan- Mandel to write the music.  But my, my reasoning was I had to write it out for Johnny Mandel, so why should I write it out twice?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You know what I mean?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I might as well do the arranging.  I knew what, what had to be done.  So, and so he gave me a hard way to go; had me in tears one time.  And I never will forget this.  Pete Candoli, famous trumpet player, and he had a brother named Conte Candoli.  Both of them played trumpets, and Pete's famous for being with the Woody Herman Herd [Woody Herman's First Herd].  But Pete, I knew Pete from the recording industry.  And somebody told--or another friend of mine who was there played piano.  Pete came to me and says, don't you worry about a thing.  You're one of us, because the, the bandleader would request and everything.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And, and we did a beautiful spiritual arrangement of 'Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.'  And my arrangement, I had the, the cellos come in and real beautiful little line, and the violins were singing a note way up top.  And he says oh, the violins can't play this.  And I said harmonics?  'Cause the violins had no problem with it, but he didn't know.
Speaker 1: Right, right, okay.
Speaker 2: But like I said, they needed us.
Speaker 1: Um-hm, um-hm. Okay.
Speaker 2: And then when they figured they didn't need us, they cut us loose and brought in a white group, and the show folded.
Story_ID: 505901
Speaker 1: Okay, now where, where should we go?
Speaker 2: Okay, we just did the four 'Jonathan Winters Shows' ['The Jonathan Winters Show'].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then we did the Andy Griffith ['The Andy Griffith Show'] special.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: Now, when they originally booked us to do the Andy, Andy Griffith special, they had something else planned they were gonna do.  And then the musicians had a strike, and they couldn't do the show.  Then when they finally decided to do the show, they were gonna do 'God's Trombones.'  And they wanted to, they wanted to, wanted us to back out.  We didn't do it for a simple reason: we had a chance to go with 'Green Acres' guy.  What's his name?
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Albert, Eddie Albert.
Speaker 1: Eddie Albert.
Speaker 2: Eddie Albert.  We couldn't do that because he wouldn't let us out of the contract even though they couldn't do the show because of the musicians' strike.  So we said heck no, you know.  We--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, we got the music at the very last minute, and it was on a disk, not on tape.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And so I had to study that music and so that I would know what to teach the, the kids.  And we knew that music so well that when we went in the studio to do it, the director had to ask me where they were.  And so when we walked in, I think they had every singer, every white singer in Hollywood was there.  So when we walked in, he said, "Oh, here's the Young Saints.  They gonna show us how it's done."  I said, "Oh, okay."  And they started clearing off the, the coats and thing off the piano.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And I said we don't need the piano.
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now, immediately they were thrown for a loop 'cause this music was hard.  They were thrown for a loop.  So I gave them pitch, and we started, and then the rest of the, all, all the rest, they started joining in.  It was, news went through the whole, whole studio like wildfire (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We went down there singing this hard music a capella.  So when we got up ready to re- prerecord, I told the kids now you can relax.  You've already proved yourself.  You don't have to kill yourself now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But what they didn't know: I had rearranged all the music to fit the voices that I had, because I think it was Brown [ph.]--and I can't remember his first name.  He did a lot of music, writing music for Hollywood.  He wrote very hard music for singers, 'cause they, they stayed on the high Cs, or they stayed on the low Cs.  We had one singer who could stay on the high C; one tenor who could stay on the high C; one bass who could stay on the low C.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So they, they, they had those notes.  For everybody else I brought it down.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So our group sang all the way through the whole thing.  And when they finished, all the white singers were so tired they were drained; worn out from singing all this hard music.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: We're the only ones left to sing the last song (laughter), and that was, I think it was 'Rock of Ages.'  We sang it by ourselves (laughter).
Story_ID: 505902
Speaker 1: I wanted to get that in, but I also want to advance us, you know, chronologically.
Speaker 2: Peggy Lee.
Speaker 1: To Peggy Lee, we've done that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: At--
Speaker 2: Then next was Frankie Laine.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: That was in '59 [1959].
Speaker 2: Major Riddle put us with Frankie Laine.  Frankie Laine did not like it worth a you know what.  And as a matter of fact, he didn't even rehearse with us.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The reason why Major Riddle put us with--he had seen us with Peggy Lee.  And Frankie Laine was booked for three dates at the Dunes [Dunes Hotel, Las Vegas, Nevada].  He had done the first one, and they had like two or three people in the audience.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, you know (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, so they needed us.
Speaker 1: Right, and they, so they were able to, to get you.  Let's go on from, from there, because you--
Speaker 2: The same thing happened with Frankie Laine.  They figured all they needed was a black group.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And so they hired a black group for the next Frankie Laine show, not us--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --'cause Frankie Laine didn't particularly like us.
Speaker 1: And once they hired the other black group?
Speaker 2: Sad.  We went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) They failed.
Speaker 2: We made the trip to Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That group was so sad they had to put three guitars in front of them to keep the, keep the pitch and the beat (laughter).
Story_ID: 505903
Speaker 1: But let's, let's go on from, from there--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --because I want to advance your career--
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: --here.  We're in the '60s [1960s].
Speaker 2: Louis Prima.
Speaker 1: Louis Prima, okay.  What did you do with Louis Prima?
Speaker 2: The first show we did was 'Roaring Froy--Forties' [ph.]
Speaker 1: What, what was that?  Was that a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And this was the first--
Speaker 1: Was--
Speaker 2: --show that Louis had done, 'cause they were, they were a lounge act.
Speaker 1: Yep, okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: So he wanted to expand the show, and they were gonna do the big stage.
Speaker 1: Okay, where was that at?
Speaker 2: At the Desert Inn [Las Vegas, Nevada]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --back at the Desert Inn.
Speaker 1: And this was 1960?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, it be '60 [1960], '61 [1961], something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay.   And so at the Desert Inn you performed with Louis Prima.  And--
Speaker 2: And the second show we did, we went to Louis' house in February.  He lived right, he was, had a house right here in Los Angeles [California]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and took off his shoes 'cause he had this big plush rug.  And he made, he, he made spaghetti, and we sat down there and planned the whole show.  And we wrote a production for him.
Speaker 1: Was this the second show?
Speaker 2: Second show.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that was when?  In '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: It would have to be '61 [1961] or '2 [1962] I think.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we were with the, Frank Laine [Frankie Laine] in '59 [1959].  It probably was '60 [1960].
Speaker 1: Okay.  And let's--'cause you, 'cause you're doing backgrounds with all of these artists.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You can just name the artists--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and so we can, you know, move it for, forward here.  Were there some more people that you were doing the background for (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, not really.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Like I said, people would only call us when they needed us.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: He wanted to do the best show he ever did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because he was doing the big room for the first time.
Story_ID: 505904
Speaker 1: So we're in the '60s [1960s] now.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and we're on the second show that Louis [Louis Prima] did--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --which was a wonderful success.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, and, and when you work in Vegas [Las Vegas, Nevada], your success comes from word of mouth.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.  So, we've done the second show.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, we wrote a whole production.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay, so we've done the second show.  What, where is your career taking you now?  Where--
Speaker 2: By that time, Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts] had, he had been working with young people all that time.  But he had been doing more or less on a one-on-one.  Then--
Speaker 1: And that was here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] he was doing this?
Speaker 2: In L.A.--(unclear)--'59 [1959] when we moved here.  We had a three-car garage in the back, so he made a workshop out of that.  And he started grouping people together.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when he came up with the name the Young Saints.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And so during the '60s [1960s], you, Thomas and, and you were working with the Young Saints.
Speaker 2: And the young people, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And just tell us a little about that.
Speaker 2: Well, when they started, when they first started out I was still busy in the record industry, and I really didn't have time for--he had it by himself.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And my daughter, Lisa [Lisa Roberts], she kind of turned her nut--nose up at it too.  She, she wasn't involved.  But we did a big concert for the church that we were going to.
Speaker 1: What church was that?
Speaker 2: Calvary Methodist Church [Calvary United Methodist Church, Los Angeles, California] there on Adams [Boulevard] and Cloverdale [Avenue].
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And we did it at the Wilshire Ebell Theatre [Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay, what year was that?  Or approximately, you know.
Speaker 2: It was in, it was probably around '64 [1964] or '5 [1965].
Speaker 1: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 2: And we had a huge group, must have been about forty people, and a huge orchestra.  Let me tell you who was in the orchestra.  You had Maynard Ferguson--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and oh, what's his name, Shelly Manne, and a lot of big stars, through my connection with the recording industry.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And so it was very well-publicized.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And (laughter) when, when we did that concert, Lisa kind of opened her eyes and said oh, something's happening.
Speaker 1: And, and what kind of attendance did you get for that?
Speaker 2: It was fair.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The church didn't sell, really didn't sell enough (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Didn't sell it.
Speaker 2: --tickets.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Speaker 2: You know how--
Speaker 1: --but approximately--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you think--I don't know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 505905
Speaker 1: What's the next major event?
Speaker 2: The next major event was the Jonathan Winters shows ['The Jonathan Winters Show'].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that, that was--
Speaker 1: Was, was that '65 [1965]?  I--
Speaker 2: No, wait, no wait a minute.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Wait; no, wait a minute.  How we got involved in that--yeah, I told you how we got involved with that.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: But, in the meantime, we did a thing for--remember Leon, Dr. Leon Sullivan?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: We did a thing for his organization, and Lena Horne was there.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're talking about '65 [1965]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Cause I'm trying to advance us.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, around, 'round that, 'round that time.
Speaker 1: Around '65 [1965], '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, before we did the Jonathan Winters shows.  And Lena Horne was there.  And also (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, now you're saying before.  What--
Speaker 2: This is before Jonathan--
Speaker 1: --what, what year was the Jonathan Winter shows?  Because you'd said--you, you had it coming before Frankie Laine before.
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: This is way after Frankie.  This is with, this is with the Young Saints.  Frankie Laine was with the Exciting Voices [Evelyn Freeman and the Exciting Voices], the one that did the--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --'Didn't it Rain,' album.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Are we straight on that?
Speaker 1: Not yet (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay, we're getting there.
Speaker 1: Because we, we need to put some dates in here because I'm getting mixed up as to who came first--
Speaker 2: The first--
Speaker 1: --because you, you had given us what happened--
Speaker 2: Exciting Voices--
Speaker 1: --on, on the--
Speaker 2: --came first.  Those are the grown people.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what year was Exciting Voices?
Speaker 2: We made the record I think in about 1957 or '8 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And we--
Speaker 1: Where we are in, where we are now is six--
Speaker 2: Now the only date I can re- remember--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --is 1959--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because that's, that's the date we bought the house.  And we had just moved in the house when we had to go to Las Vegas [Nevada]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --with Frankie Laine.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Where, where I'm at now is--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty [1960], '61 [1962], '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: No, '64 [1964] there's a concert--

Speaker 1: --for forty people, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in his huge legends only or- orchestra.
Speaker 1: Right, okay.
Speaker 2: It was wonderful.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what came, what came after that?  Let's go ahead--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: The, the--
Speaker 1: Or, you know--
Speaker 2: --thing we did with OIC [Opportunities Industrialization Centers]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Leon, Dr. Leon Sullivan.
Speaker 1: OIC.
Speaker 2: And I think because Lena Horne was there, there was an agent from Ashley-Famous.  And, and he signed us up with the Ashley-Famous--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --agency.
Speaker 1: Now would this be '66 [1966]?
Speaker 2: You know, I couldn't give you an exact--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --date, but it was before the Jonathan Winters shows.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now, the OIC benefit with Lena Horne, and what comes after that?  Or, we'll, we'll get it straight--
Speaker 2: Well, Ashley-Famous was handling the Jonathan Winters shows.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry--
Speaker 2: Ashley-Famous was the agent--
Speaker 1: Okay, so would that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) who booked us at--
Speaker 1: --come after the Lena Horne benefit for--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --OIC?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause the agent was in the audience--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when we did that benefit.
Speaker 1: Okay, go ahead.  We won't worry about the date.  Ashley-Famous was in the audience for the benefit for OIC.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so he asked you to do something for Jonathan Winters, Winters?
Speaker 2: Well, his agency was handling Jonathan Winters' show, and so that's--Jonathan Winters was about to get axed, and they needed something to, to give them a shot in the arm--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --and we were it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you did four shows with Jon, Jonathan Winters, right?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that sort of revived his chances, or he--
Speaker 2: Oh--
Speaker 1: --stayed on a little bit longer than, than he would have--
Speaker 2: He, he got picked up for another season.
Story_ID: 505906
Speaker 1: Now what about after that, now?
Speaker 2: Well, somewhere in between then, and I think it was before--somewhere in there we did some shows with Eddie Albert.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But after that came Danny Kaye.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'm gonna put Eddie Albert and then Danny Kaye.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now, and you did those shows.
Speaker 2: Now with 'The Danny Kaye Show,' of course, we were not only background for Danny Kaye, but we also did the Young Saints act.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, the--
Speaker 2: They also--
Speaker 1: Oh, the--
Speaker 2: --were featured.
Speaker 1: The Young Saints?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were featured.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, and then aft--after that?
Speaker 2: We did the Andy Griffith ['The Andy Griffith Show'] special.  And we were having problems with AFTRA [American Federation of Television and Radio Artists; Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)].  There was a certain guy in there who didn't like us at all, didn't think we, we had any business being there.  And I can give you his name.  His name--I'll never forget it.  His name was David O. Tyveghnly [ph.].
Speaker 1: (Laughter) David O. Ty--
Speaker 2: O. and then Tyveghnly, T--I think it was T-Y and T, T-Y, Ty, with a G-H and the L-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm gonna, okay.
Speaker 2: He was head of AFTRA out here.  And he--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --he practically priced us out of television.  For 'The Andy Griffith Show,' he made them pay us something like eight thousand dollars.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They could've get a big, they could get a big act for less than that.
Story_ID: 505907
Speaker 1: And so after the 'Andy Griffin' ['The Andy Griffith Show'] special--
Speaker 2: That's when Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts] decided that since-enough, they're not gonna let us in, you know, if I can't make any money at it, I might as well give it away.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And he decided to move over--they found a play--oh, I forgot about the White House.  That's in there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: That's 1970.  I got a definite date on that.
Speaker 1: Okay, wonderful.
Speaker 2: When we--
Speaker 1: White House, 1970.
Speaker 2: Um-hm, and 'Ed Sullivan Show' ['The Ed Sullivan Show'] followed that.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, good enough.  Okay, so but you were saying Thomas decided if they're not going to let us in or such a huge struggle to get in--your foot in the door--what does he decide?
Speaker 2: He decides that, to move to where they really needed us.  So he sent out Roger [ph.], who was one of the, like, lieutenants in the Young Saints.  And he found this warehouse, burned out warehouse, at the corner of Gage [Avenue] and 61st Street, I think, 6--Gage and not Broadway.  What's the next street over?  Main [Street].
Speaker 1: Main, right--
Speaker 2: Gage and Main.
Speaker 1: --okay.  He--
Speaker 2: How could I forget that?
Speaker 1: Okay, Thomas rented or bought a--
Speaker 2: Rented.
Speaker 1: --rented--
Speaker 2: And was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) a, a--what, what was it, a loft or?
Speaker 2: It was a huge warehouse.  It was--
Speaker 1: Warehouse.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: It was a big, huge building.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And Tom Bradley had just been elected mayor.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact, we, I, I had--
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: --the band that played--
Speaker 1: --what are we talking about, '73 [1973]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --seventy-three [1973]?  Let's say '73 [1973].
Speaker 2: Yeah, we, we, we got in, we moved in their in '72 [1972], but we had, we were at--I had the band at Mayor Bradley's first inauguration.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: And through the mayor's office we got in on a new program called Model Cities.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we started teaching telecommunications there.
Speaker 1: In that warehouse?
Speaker 2: (Nods head).
Speaker 1: Okay, good.
Speaker 2: And a lot--along with the performing arts.
Speaker 1: Okay, good.  All right, and how long did you do, do that teaching telecommunications in, in that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We did that for a long time, until, practically until we had to leave the building.
Speaker 1: Okay, just in sense of--
Speaker 2: And we--
Speaker 1: --your best guesstimate.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were, we hooked up with a company called--right over my head.  Anyway, we made a connection with the owners, and they sent people over to do the instruction.  A matter of fact, we, we got people coming in from different television stations.  'Cause I remember one time the kids were doing--
Speaker 1: All right, let me, let me get this because this is going to be important.
Speaker 2: The chronology is--
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1973--
Speaker 2: We got a city contract.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Model Cities it was called.
Speaker 1: Right, and I've got that down.  What I'm trying to do is take it to up until what time.
Speaker 2: We left the main engagement in, I think it was '82 [1982].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's when we went over to Second Baptist [Second Baptist Church, Los Angeles, California].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Then you--1982.  Then, then did you carry the program over to Second Baptist?
Speaker 2: We did, but it wasn't in, the telecommunications wasn't as extensive--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --although we had our own cameras.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, 1982 you were at Second Baptist?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Reverend Kil- Kilgore [Thomas Kilgore, Jr.] was a great, was a good friend.
Story_ID: 505908
Speaker 1: The 1982, did the program survive, you know, being over there at Second Baptist [Second Baptist Church, Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, at that, but the whole direction was a little different.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Were, were you and Thomas [Thomas S. Roberts] still running it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How long after it moved to Second Baptist were you running it?  I'm trying to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: How did--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Until we, we left Second Baptist, which was last year.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so we can take it up to 2005?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, good, good; when you announced your retirement?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, good enough.  That's what I was trying--
Speaker 2: No, actually, actually I had announced it ahead of that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --in 2002, 'cause that was the last yearbook I put out.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  The--
Speaker 2: But it just took me that long to wind down.
Speaker 1: I understand, I, I understand.
Speaker 2: Now the program is--
Speaker 1: The--
Speaker 2: --still going, but it's not, it's not the Young Saints anymore in this town.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The Young Saints is now with my granddaughter in Oakland [California].
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, she's--
Speaker 2: She's a dan- she dances and teaches dance in Oakland.

Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You've heard of Dimensions?
Speaker 1: I haven't.

Speaker 2: And we have--he built a big stage there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we, and we produced a lot of very good things that are on tape.

Speaker 2: You know, we did (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) and your husband have started.

Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: No, it was the discipline.

Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --after.
Speaker 2: I announced my retirement in 2002.  And I'll have to show you the yearbook, and that was the last one we put out.  But it took a while to kind of wind things down.

Speaker 2: Her heart just stopped one day.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was May of last year.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, so May of 2005.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the reason she stopped singing commercially was that she had a brain tumor removed.
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 505911
Speaker 1: Let me ask you, I wanted to be sure we've covered everything, and so is there anything that you can think of that we may have left out of this inter- interview?
Speaker 2: Probably a whole lot (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, but you can't think of anything now, so--
Speaker 2: Well, I, I think one of the high points of our career was the singing at the White House [Washington, D.C.]--
Speaker 1: Okay, and--
Speaker 2: --and that we put the kids [in the Young Saints] on a bus, and I think we, we stopped in, they stopped in Phoenix [Arizona], and then we stopped in Chicago [Illinois].  Now we were being sponsored by the Butcher Workmen of America [Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America].  And when we got to Chicago they were feuding (laughter).  And my husband [Thomas S. Roberts] said let's get out of here (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So we got right back on the bus and went to Cleveland [Ohio] instead.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And while we were in Cleveland, we did a big concert at Shiloh--not Shiloh, at Antioch--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --Baptist Church [Antioch Baptist Church, Cleveland, Ohio], which is one of the big uppity churches there.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And Sandra Shark's [ph.] mother, Faith [ph.]--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --told us, says, you know, you guys were like a breath of fresh air (laughter). We started, we started doing our old happy dance.  Oh, the minister got, he got really worried, but the people really enjoyed it.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 2: And that's when we went to--after 'The Ed Sullivan Show' when we were in New York [New York], we went to that--
Speaker 1: Wait, you're, you're skipping over some things here.  You're on your way to the White House.
Speaker 2: Yeah,
Speaker 1: And you're in Cleveland.  You've just done the concert at Antioch.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then we got on the, on the bus and, and went to Washington [D.C.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: The kids stayed in the YM, the YMCA [YMCA National Capital, Washington, D.C.] there.
Speaker 1: Okay, the one in Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --on Rhode Island Avenue.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And you performed--
Speaker 2: We were three, yeah, we were three (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) for President, for President Nixon [President Richard Milhous Nixon].
Speaker 2: We were three days in the White House, Tommy get, getting everything straight.  That's when he figured out that he had to baffle the whole room.  So he had to baffle the, baffle the band.  We got the band from the Marines [U.S. Marine Corps], and they were good, but he sent for our drummer and trumpet player.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that, and hey, we had a terrific band.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: They were great.  And I had a piano there and Hammond organ.
Story_ID: 505912
Speaker 1: And when the president [President Richard Milhous Nixon] introduced us [Young Saints], he introduced us very offhand: "Oh, there's a group here from California.  I don't think they--," you know.  And I said you son of a gun, you just wait (laughter).
Speaker 2: Right, and you performed?
Speaker 1: When I was sitting here waiting for them to come in, the president and the Duchess of Windsor [Wallis Simpson] came in first.  And then the Duke of Windsor [Edward VIII] and Mrs. President [Pat Nixon] came in, then followed by the vice president [Spiro Agnew] and his wife [Judy Agnew], and then the secretary of state [William P. Rogers].  They had, had a real protocol.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And then that's when it hit me that here we are enter- entertaining for the top people in America.  And it hit, really did, didn't hit me until that time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, so, of course, the, the whole presidential party sat on the front row.  And the duke, he was something.  He had this cane.  He was tapping the cane on the floor and punching the president every time something happened, you know.  I know his, the president's ribs must have been sore.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And one of the, the secret servicemen was heard to say, "Well, they can't this, the White House isn't stuffy anymore."  So when we finished, we were all supposed to come on, on stage, you know, and take pictures or whatever it was they were gonna do.  The president couldn't get the duke to go in the right direction.  The president had to head for me, and I'm way over here.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the president had his coattails trying to (laughter)--funniest things you could, could, you can imagine--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --somebody says, why didn't they take a picture of that?  And somebody else said they wouldn't dare (laughter).  Anyway, the president and the duke himself, they finally got over to--and I'm trying to get out of there to get on the stage.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He didn't have that much to say but ah, yeah, said, "Oh, that rhythm, that rhythm," he says, you know.  So finally, the president says, "Your highness, we have to move over to the stage."  He says, "Oh, oh, all right, all right."  So the three of us moved together over on the stage.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And the Duchess of Windsor looked like a little--what do they call those dolls?
Speaker 2: Kewpie dolls?
Speaker 1: Not Kewpie dolls, but it's a collectible doll--Dresden doll.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: She looked like a Dresden doll.  They, they were tiny people.  They weren't large people at all, tiny people.  And, and here they are--and he had to talk to all the kids, the duke did.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And he said, "You know, I used to dance, you know, before I, I got a bum leg and used--," so finally, the duchess said, "Shut up, David.  The president wants to talk," (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay, and then the president spoke.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he spoke.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: So, and Tommy [Thomas S. Roberts] had said before we did all, when I was doing the, our last song, which was 'When The Saints Go Marching In,' and he said, "There's, it's a long way from Watts [Los Angeles, California] to the White House [Washington, D.C.]."
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that, that was framing the expression.  They put that in--we had a three-page sped--spread in the Times--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --Los Angeles Times from that, from Watts--(unclear)--from Watts to the White House.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: So the president gets up and says, you know, it's a long way from Whittier [California] to the White House (laughter).
Story_ID: 505913
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered by your friends, and admirers, and family?
Speaker 2: You know, it's a funny thing: I never wanted to be a teacher.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Ducked it all my life, and I've been teaching all my life.  So how you figure that?
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: But I would, I think I would be like, like to be remembered as a humanist and an educator.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that's it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The, you're gonna be remembered for much more than that, by the way.  Let me put that in there (laughter), whether you like it or not (laughter).
Story_ID: 505914
Speaker 1: But we, you know, I'm happy that I met you and that I know there are a lot of kids, and we're gonna show those pictures of them.
Speaker 2: Oh, there are so many kids that, that tell me twenty years later.  They said you know, I'm in a, I'm in a career that I never thought, never even imagined that I could be in.  And some of the early ones, like Lisa [Lisa Roberts], became background singers and has traveled all over the world.
Speaker 1: Right.  And yeah, you made an impact on a lot of people's lives.  And I think people are going to remember you for a long time--
Speaker 2: Well, I sure hope so.
Speaker 1: --on, on that.
Speaker 2: I don't want to, I don't want to be just a, a, a speck (laughter) in, in the--
Speaker 1: You have assured us of, of that.  You will not be a speck.  Now what we want to do is shoot some of the pictures and--
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, I haven't quit, because I'm still talking about music.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: And I'm, I'm over at Oasis [ph.]at (unclear).  There's a lot going on over there.  I've taught music, not, not talk instruments, but I've, I've, I've taught, like, ear training and harmony.  I have taught appreciation.  And I a presentation that I do every February on black musicians of the 1920s, '30s [1930s], and '40s [1940s]--
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: --whose music is in mainstream American music, but you don't know who wrote the music--
Speaker 1: Oh--
Speaker 2: --so that, that people find that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) well, so you still have a lot to offer.
Speaker 2: People find that very interesting--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --because and that's mentioned 'Sweet Georgia Brown.'  Nobody knows who wrote that--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --but you know the song.
Speaker 1: Right, right, so--
Speaker 2: And the last thing I did, which was a couple of weeks ago, I was talking about my early years, how I grew up, and why I am who I am (laughter).
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: And people found that so interesting.
Speaker 1: And I think they'll find this very interesting that we're doing today.
Speaker 2: Well, I hope so.

Speaker 1: Well, you know, we had done a, a show with Peggy Lee, in fact, a couple of shows with Peggy Lee and--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: And I really don't know the year.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, do you remember about the decade?
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would have to be in the '70s [1970s], I believe, or early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: And I don't know what we're doing.  That's just a picture
Speaker 1: Approximately what year?
Speaker 2: That would have to be in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: That's a picture the newspaper took for, took of me because they wanted a color picture, and I didn't have any current.  So--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  About what time period?
Speaker 1: I think that was in the '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Was there a particular occasion associated with this photo?
Speaker 1: Yeah, they were doing a newspaper article on me, and they just needed a picture.
Speaker 2: That's my daughter, Lisa [Lisa Roberts], on the left and my daughter, and my granddaughter, Shaunie [ph.], next to her, and next to her is Claire [Claire Roberts], whom you met, and this is Lisa's son, Brandon [ph.].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: That's, I was at the White House [Washington, D.C.] with President [President Richard Milhous Nixon] and Mrs. Nixon [Pat Nixon] and the Duke [Duke of Windsor, Edward VIII] and Duchess of Windsor [Wallis Simpson].  That was 1970.
Speaker 1: That's in that, that's in the '70s [1970s].  That's a production 'New York, New York.'  They're in the top hats and canes doing 'New York, New York.'
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: That's one of the pictures from the Don--'The Jonathan Winters Show.'  That was in the '60s [1960s], around 1968.
Speaker 2: The top, yeah, the top picture is Evelyn's Freeman's Swing Band [Evelyn Freeman Swing Band].  We were playing at the so--at the Circle Ballroom in Cleveland [Ohio].  That was before the war [World War II, WWII], so I guess that'll make it 1939 or '40 [1940].  And we had a, we, just some famous musicians came out of that band.
Speaker 1: And the second one down is the same band forty years later.  I think we all look old in that picture.
Speaker 2: And the last one is a, a young Tommy Roberts [Thomas S. Roberts] with Lena Horne.  Tommy was with Cootie Williams band, and they were at a theater in Boston [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: That's Tommy Roberts in his prime.  We were doing a show in Las Vegas [Nevada].
Speaker 2: And the middle picture is the Young Saints with Danny Kaye.
Speaker 1: And the bottom picture was, that's me as a young lady.  I, it was in the, I was in my early twenties.
Speaker 2: This is recognition day.  We, every September, which is the last quarter of our year, we recognize students for outstanding achievement.  And they have certificates of excellence in dance, drama, and anything else that we had been teaching at the time.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What date, year, or time period would you associate with this photo?
Speaker 2: I would say in the '90s [1990].
Speaker 1: That's a young lady in working the camera.  It's amazing that the girls were better at it than the fellows.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What year?
Speaker 1: That would be in the '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: That's a group of students in our summer program, which was a kind of extended training program.  I, I guess it must be at least sixty people there.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  When was this taken?
Speaker 2: This was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 1: That's my oldest daughter, Anita [Evelyn Anita Roberts].  And this was in the '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Can you give the occasion?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was at her wedding.
Speaker 2: This is my daughter, Anita.  She's my oldest daughter.  She's deceased now.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Is it Nita or Anita?
Speaker 2: An- Anita.
Speaker 1: Oh, that picture's kind of beat up, looks like we had to dig it out from someplace.  I guess we did.  That's when we were with Frankie Laine at the Dunes Hotel [Las Vegas, Nevada] in 1959.
Speaker 2: This is Evelyn Freeman Swing Band at the Circle Ballroom in Cleveland, Ohio.  This would be in the late, very late '30s [1930s] or early '40s [1940s].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Is this while you were still in high school [Central High School, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I was just out of high school, but the rest of the band was still in high school.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  So you had just gone to the Institute of Music [Cleveland Institute of Music, Cleveland, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This is my mother [Gertrude Richardson Freeman] and father [Ernest Freeman, Sr.] in their later years.  I don't, I don't know why they're not smiling, 'cause my father had a wicked sense of humor.
Speaker 2: Ah, is that right?  Now we know where you get yours.
Speaker 1: Oh yes, this is a rose between two thorns.  I'm in the middle, my brother Art [Arthur Freeman], is to the left, and my brother Ernie [Ernest Freeman, Jr.] is to the right.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  A time period?
Speaker 1: Ah, that would have to be in the '60s [1960s] I think.  I'm looking at the dress I'm wearing.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, was there a particular occasion or?
Speaker 1: No, my husband just called a photographer one day and told them to come on over.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is my brother Ernie's, one of his hit records before he really got into the arranging part of it.  He was still performing on the piano.  And it's called 'Dreaming with Freeman.'  And I also did a couple of tracks on that also.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  The year?
Speaker 2: Let me see.  This would had to be very early, so I would say the late '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  When did your brother come to ha- to Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: He came to Los Angeles about the same time I went to New York [New York], which would be between '46 [1946] and '47 [1947].
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is Tommy Roberts.  He was a great authoritarian, and he ran a very tight ship.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  And year?
Speaker 1: Looking at the hair, I would say that it was rather early.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  What do you mean?
Speaker 1: Before he lost, before he lost it (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  In the '60s [1960s], '70s [1970s]?
Speaker 1: Let's say early '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is my daughter, Lisa, at the height of her career.  She has a very wonderful career as a background singer, singing background for, for everybody from Barbara Streisand to Ike [Ike Turner] and Tina Turner.  And she was listed as one of the top five hundred singers in, in the country.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  So the height of her career, what, what year would you put that or--
Speaker 1: I would say, let's see, it was before 1990, so it would have to be--
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  In the '80s [1980s] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) in the '80s [1980s] or late '70s [1970s].
Speaker 2: But she was still working at the--
Speaker 1: This is a photo, this is a family photo, and I think it's the only one we ever had made.  And I think we were working in Las Vegas at the time.  And it was probably the Frankie Laine show.  And we had, the family was there with us.  And I would put this at, say, 1959.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Would you wanna identify visually the people?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Just to top row, viewer's left to right and bottom row viewer's left to right.
Speaker 1: Okay, you have my son, Ernest [Ernest Roberts], and that's me in the middle, and my husband, Tommy, and then, and the bottom row you have Anita, Lisa, and Claire.
Speaker 2: And one more.
Speaker 1: Oh, that, that's Tommy and myself.
Speaker 2: And the larger picture, of course, are the--
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Hold on one second, let me finish up this--(unclear).  Bear with me a second.  Okay, and the other photo on the right.
Speaker 2: And there on the stage with some production, and I couldn't tell you right now what production that was.  And there is a date on the paper.  Can you see that?
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Yeah, I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the side there, yeah.  And this article, this was a Times [Los Angeles Times] article and a Times photo by Stanley Williford.  And it took up two pages in the calendar, Times calendar, Los Angeles Times calendar.
