Story_ID: 73703
Speaker 1: Okay.  I'd like to ask you about your family history.  And you do have quite a bit of history here, so, can you sort of--how far back can you go with your family, can you trace your family?
Speaker 2: My grandfather, Josiah T. Walls.  He was the, he was one of the first Negroes that was in the Forty-third [United States] Congress [sic, he was in the Forty-second, Forty-third, and Forty-forth Congresses, 1871-1875], and that was our first Congress [sic, Hiram Rhodes Revels and Joseph Rainey were both seated in the Forty-first Congress in 1870].
Speaker 1: So that's about, we're talking about what, 1866 [sic, 1871], I guess or so?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So he would have probably, at least have been thirty years old, I guess, to be a congressman [sic, twenty-five for the House of Representatives] which would mean that he would have to have been born at least in 18--by 1830, I guess [sic, December 30, 1842].  So that's--
Speaker 2: Something like that.  I really don't have that information?
Speaker 1: So do you have much information about Josiah T. Walls or--
Speaker 2: I do know that he left the Congress, and he went to Florida A and M University [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in Tallahassee, Florida] as a superintendent [sic, Farm Director].
Speaker 1: Okay, so he was the, basically, the chief executive of Florida A and M?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: Okay, any stories about his personality or any incidents in his life?
Speaker 2: No, that was too far, too far in the past.  I don't have those documentations.  They were destroyed.
Speaker 1: And nobody talked about or passed any stories down?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 73704
Speaker 1: Now, that's your father's [James T. Wall] side of the family?
Speaker 2: That's my father's side.
Speaker 1: And what about your mother's side?
Speaker 2: My mother's side had, there was my grand, my great grand [grandmother] was a teacher at Tougaloo University [sic, Tougaloo College] in Jackson, Mississippi.  And my grandfather and his family started a little community there in Jackson, Mississippi.  It's, it's called Whitfield Mill Road in Jackson.  And generations and generations live in this little town, and it has its own church and very own cemetery and homes.  And that's, that's about all I know about that.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you know what your great grandmother's name was, that taught at Tougaloo?
Speaker 2: Hattie Phillips.
Speaker 1: So your mother's [Annie May Dean] family is from Mississippi, basically?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Far (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your father's [James T. Wall] family?
Speaker 2: From Barbados.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you can trace them all the way back to Barbados?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what state did Josiah T. Walls represent in the--
Speaker 2: I can't tell you at this time.  I don't remember [Florida].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 73705
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, can you give us your father's name and spell it for us and tell us when he was born?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my father's name was James, J-A-M-E-S, Turner, T-U-R-N-E-R, Wall, W-A-L-L.
Speaker 1: And his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I'm thinking it's like 1871 or '79 [1871] something, somewhere close to 1880.
Speaker 1: And where was he born?
Speaker 2: In Barbados.  That's all I know.
Speaker 1: Oh, in Barbados.  Now, okay, so this is--okay.  He's the son of Josiah T. Walls?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And, so did Josiah T. Walls move to Barbados at a certain point--
Speaker 2: That part of the history, I have no inclination.  I would have to do some more research myself.
Speaker 1: But he was born in Barbados?
Speaker 2: Yes, um-hum.
Speaker 1: All right, and did--
Speaker 2: And he lived in the Carolinas too, but I don't know where.  He was, my parents had been married, and he was very old when I was conceived.  So I don't have that information at my fingertips.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, do you have any information about--well, tell us about what kind of person he was and what did he do?
Speaker 2: My dad, my dad owned the Ofell [ph.] Manufacturing Company [cannot confirm].  It was the, a company similar to the Murray's hair pomade and Murray's hair products.  My father, he made cosmetics, and the base was sold to the Johnson Manufacturing Company who now makes Fashion Fair.
Speaker 1: Okay, Johnson Publishing Company.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, so was that the only occupation he had?
Speaker 2: He, he wrote music.  He was a prolific writer.  He, he traveled worldwide, and he sung, I'm told.  They would hand out handbills, and they--he and a fellow named, Bill, they would go and sing all over the country.  My father was a tenor.
Speaker 1: And so he was a singer and an entrepreneur?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was.
Speaker 1: And was he a chemist as well?
Speaker 2: Yes, he, I think in school, his major was chemistry.  I would assume that it had to be for him to make the products that he did.  And they were products for the black community, and he did very well with it.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said that he had something to do with Burr Oaks Cemetery?
Speaker 2: My father was president of the Burr Oaks Cemetery, and he was also president of the Southside Bank and Trust Company [South Side Trust and Savings Bank?] in Chicago [Illinois].  He was one of the three black men that lost a lot of money in the Chicago Art Exposition, that was during the World Fair.  But that was before my time.
Speaker 1: Okay, oh, in 1893, he lost a lot of money?  Or--
Speaker 2: Not my dad, no, no--
Speaker 1: Nineteen thirty-three [1933].
Speaker 2: Nineteen thirty-three [1933], yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Century of Progress" (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.
Speaker 2: And the reason I don't have knowledge of that is those records were taken from us and destroyed, not deliberately destroyed because they were historical records.  It was because they were thought to be of value and for some reason, they were taken.
Speaker 1: Taken by who--
Speaker 2: Thieves.
Speaker 1: --thieves.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in with other things that was taken from the home.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that he was president, again, of his--
Speaker 2: The Chicago--Southside Bank and Trust Company [South Side Trust and Savings Bank?]  and the Burr Oaks Cemetery.  And that's on record there at Burr Oaks Cemetery.
Speaker 1: Okay, Southside Bank and Trust.  Now, this is a black bank?
Speaker 2: It, it is now.
Speaker 1: At the time it was--(unclear)--
Speaker 2: I'm thinking it was integrated, I think, somewhat.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, that's something, you know, to be president of a bank.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yes, yes, yes.  It's in a book.  I can't tell you because I was the last child and unexpected.  And I don't, didn't have privy to all of that information.
Speaker 1: But there's a book that--
Speaker 2: There's a book with his picture in it, and all this information.  And I've tried to retrieve it, and I really don't know where to go now.  But I'm sure that I could find it.
Story_ID: 73706
Speaker 1: Now, so, your father [James T. Wall] was, I think you said, I think he was over sixty when he had you, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, closer to seventy.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, did he live very long when you were coming up?
Speaker 2: No, he didn't.  He died before I got out of grammar school.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you didn't really--did you get a chance to know him very well.
Speaker 2: Yes, he used to read to me, put me on his lap and read to me at night.  And, or when I was disruptive in the house, that was my punishment, reading to me the history of the black people, the--at that time, they were known as Negroes, and the Africans, and he was always showing me the similarities and culture.  He was, he was always interested in helping me to develop culturally.
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember any of the books, the titles of any of the books he read from?
Speaker 2: Books of knowledge.  In fact, I still have one moldy one.  I did keep that, and they date back, I would say to the 1900s, that collection that he had, a set of them.
Speaker 1: Encyclopedia.
Speaker 2: Yes, they were called the "Books of Knowledge."
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Story_ID: 73707
Speaker 1: Okay, can you--so your father [James T. Wall] died about what year, do you think?
Speaker 2: In the '40's [1940s].
Speaker 1: In the mid-1940s?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And how many brothers and sisters did you have?
Speaker 2: I had, in the first family, I had, it was six of our total.  And my sister and I was raised--the, my brothers and sisters were grown when we were born.
Speaker 1: Okay, so your father was married twice or married two (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right, so there were six in the first set, and then--
Speaker 2: No, there was four in the first set and two in the second set.
Speaker 1: Two in the second set, okay.
Story_ID: 73708
Speaker 1: All right, so can you tell us about your mother?  Can you give us her name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: My mother's name was Annie, A-N-N-I-E, and they spelled the middle name, May, M-A-Y, and her name was Wall.  But she remarried after my father passed on, and her name was Dean, D-E-A-N.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did she--what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Her maiden name was Phillips.
Speaker 1: Phillips, okay.  And, well, tell us about her background?  Where was she born and raised?
Speaker 2: She was born in Jackson, Mississippi.  She had an education there.  I don't remember.  I think she finished high school.  At that time, that wasn't something that they pushed in the South.  She, she became a nurse, and she worked as a nurse.  And after my father [James T. Wall] died, she was a homemaker.
Speaker 1: Okay, did she go to school at Tougaloo [College in Jackson, Mississippi] or did she--
Speaker 2: No, she didn't go to college.  I know she didn't go to college.
Speaker 1: Okay, but her family had a background at Tougaloo?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Her grandmother, I guess--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Her grandmother, yeah.
Speaker 1: --taught at Tougaloo.  So, what kind of person was she?  What did she do?
Speaker 2: My mom.  We gave her the title of, she had--we said she had "a Ph.D. in humanity" and just and how to get things done.  And she just had a gift for that.  And so we used to call her "Doc" (laughter) because she was so good at what she did, very loving, very protective of her children.  And after my dad died, she was the, the nurturer and the protector.
Speaker 1: Now, when your father died, times got a little tough, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Times did get tough, yes, yes, yes.  My father as--in the work that he did and the way that he lived, he lost a lot of money I'm told in the World's Fair [1933], most of the money.  And then my mother had to stay at home and stretch.  And there were times that we didn't have toys for Christmas, but we had something, and I was reminded of it last week when I saw the, Savion Glover's production, and the young men who were playing on the pots.  And it just took me back to memory lane.  We played with the pots--after we, she would know when we finished the housework.  Then we would, we would bang on the pots and pans (laughter) and sing.  And it was so much fun because we had so much love in the home.
Speaker 1: That's great.
Story_ID: 73709
Speaker 1: All right, did your parents [James T. Wall and Annie May Dean] have a story about how they met?  Did they talk about how they met at all?
Speaker 2: Yes, my daddy--my mom was--the little red flower.  She was, she had, she was selling poppies for a fundraiser.  And he drove by in this big--what did she tell me, Pierce-Arrow, and he bought a poppy from her, and then he drove around the corner, and he came back, and he bought some more poppies (laughter).  And then he asked her out.
Speaker 1: So they just, things blossomed from there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 73710
Speaker 1: Can you give us an idea--now, you were raised in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And what part of town?
Speaker 2: South Side.
Speaker 1: Okay, and then, I guess that part of town was known as Bronzeville, right?
Speaker 2: Forty-seventh, we grew up on 47th Street, Regal Theater, South Center, Walgreen's--not, Walgreen's, yes, the five and 10 cents store, Woolworth's.  No, there was this group of men that had the stores--I can't remember it off hand.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But, grew up 47th Street.
Speaker 1: Can you describe the home you lived in and kind of reflect on some of the sights, and sounds and smells of the neighborhood that you grew up in?
Speaker 2: Okay, we had a house in the beginning.  When my dad [James T. Wall] died, my mother [Annie May Dean] moved into this building, and it was like--we had a large apartment, seven rooms, and we lived at 47th and--we ended up at 47th and Evans.  And it was just like a big community home, but the apartments were separate.  We, it was a family-type building, although people lived in their own apartments and their own lives.  And as children we had the opportunity to make the decision of where we were going to--what we were going to do.  Were we gonna be with the bad kids or the good kids.  And so I shied away from those that, always shied away from those that were not as pure as I wanted them to be.  But it, the sounds, the Temptations, who else, the Four Tops.  That was the music.  And the ending of [Jean-Baptiste] Illinois Jacquet and Miles Davis and John Coltrane, Lester Young.  I played the saxophone in high school because I wanted to play like Lester (laughter).  And I never did accomplish that, but I learned to play my clarinet pretty well.  The sounds was, the foods, the smells of greens and chicken and chitlins.  Those were the smells.  The people would come out in the summertime and sit on the front, the mothers would come with--the fathers would come out with the children and sit on the front of this big, huge, brown building that we lived in.  And we would all get out there in the summertime and laugh and play and jump rope, double dutch and things like that.
Speaker 1: Were there many street vendors in those days?
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact, my cousin had produce that he would put out.  Yes, there were vendors and on Saturday, going to the movie.  That was our entertainment on Saturday, and they would have all these beautiful fruits out on the stands in wintertime, Christmastime, pecans and Christmas trees and candy canes and things like that.  And it was, it was a feeling, very different from what we have today.  We could walk down the allies in Chicago [Illinois] from one corner to the other and with no fear.  We had locks on our door--I mean we didn't necessarily lock our doors.  That's what I'm trying to say.  We closed them, but we didn't lock them.  It was nothing to sleep out on the back porch in those times.
Speaker 1: You know you'd wake up with everything.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Now, it's bolt down, tie down, pray and burglar alarms (laughter).
Story_ID: 73711
Speaker 1: So, well, what kind of a little girl were you?  And what did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I wanted to be somebody 'cause that's what my dad [James T. Wall] talked about.  And I always wanted to just, just--I wanted to teach, and I just felt that I had something to give to the world, and, and that's what I wanted to do.  But as a young child, I acquired a very debilitating disease, and they never could really put a spin on it, what it was.  And they sent a surgeon, a young man, his name, I never will forget it.  It was Bronachowski (ph.) from Poland to look at me because I was such a special case.  And by the time I was seventeen, they had just told my mother [Annie May Dean] that I wouldn't, I wouldn't make it.  I was gonna die.  And so my mother was one, a very religious person, and my father too.  And she, they would come, and they would pray for me.  And I didn't feel sick.  I just, I was just very thin.  And--
Speaker 1: When did you first get sick?
Speaker 2: Nineteen--I was, 1940 or '50' [1950], something like that, '40' [1940], '50' [1950].  And I, they really thought I was gonna die.  And I never thought I was gonna die.  And I saw the, the light and the message came that I used to always say that, "ask the Lord to save me" because if he wasn't gonna heal me--since they said I was sick, I didn't feel sick, that he would take me to heaven with him.  And I never will forget this day, I turned, I, I prayed and I turned to the wall.  And I asked the Lord to save me, and, and heal me and let me go back home.  And, I said, "Whatever you do, don't let me go to hell 'cause my mama told me about hell.  I don't wanna die and go to hell.  I wanna live with you."  And the next night, I was in my room, and I had put this, had the white linen on the bed.  I liked white linen.  And something came and just shook my bed.  I didn't see anything.  And it was like a voice in my head say, "You look at your hands.  Your hands look new.  You look at your feet and they do too.  And say, you told me to wake you up."  And when I went back to the doctor, he said, he said, "Everything is changing."  And I said, "Like what?"  He says, "Things are just changing, your blood work, everything this changing."  And I said, "Oh."  And I said, well, that's because--I said, he had asked me, he said, well, let's pray prior to this.  And we prayed about it.  And the result was I received a healing.  It wasn't a miraculous, right there, that day.  But from that day on, I've never been sick.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, you were sick basically, all through high school, I guess, then, right?
Speaker 2: I missed high school.  I had to go back.  I had to get my papers and degree--I had to actually go back to get them because I was sick--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) high school at seventeen and go back and--
Speaker 2: Had to go back.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: I did quite well prior to that 'cause I started high school at thirteen.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I was just at the end of football, basketball, those things I didn't have, so I just went back and did independent studies.
Story_ID: 73712
Speaker 1: Let's go back maybe a little bit further.  I didn't talk about grade school, but what grade school did you attend?
Speaker 2: Willard [Elementary School], 49th and Forestville, which they have torn down now.  It's a nice little apartment complex.
Speaker 1: Okay, and how did you like grade school?
Speaker 2: I loved grade school, and it was fun.  It was fun, and my mama was always home to greet me and I, I liked English.  I didn't like math, never, never liked math.  And it--I liked all the little things that we did at school, but everything except math because for some reason, I couldn't get the formula together.  And that's what math is, is the formula--it's made up of formulas.
Speaker 1: Okay, were there any teachers you remember that you particularly liked or were helpful to you?
Speaker 2: Can't give you her name, but I remember Ms. Smith.  She was a very stern teacher and a Ms. Williams.  They were the ones that stuck in my mind.  [phone ringing]  Mr. Ewing [phone ringing] was a teacher that [pause]--
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: I was a happy little girl.
Speaker 1: Okay, teachers.
Speaker 2: I was very happy, and, and my teachers--but you see, in the public school, the--I don't wanna go too fast.  I don't wanna take you into high school yet, but the little that I had together, they didn't want, they told us that if we, we just needed to know enough to do domestic work, that we would never--I wanted to teach.  And that would never be a possibility.
Speaker 1: They used to tell you this in--
Speaker 2: In school, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, were most of your teachers white or were they black or--
Speaker 2: Most of 'em were white.  Most of 'em were white.  When I would go in for the little consultation, when I was getting ready to graduate, they called me and I said I wanted to teach.  And we don't think that your family can afford this, your mom anyway.  And so I think you should take home economics, which I didn't take.  So this was the mentality of the teachers in the public schools then.  And if like, I never learned math in, in grammar school, and didn't really get it in high school.  I had to go back and independently, in college, engage a teacher to tutor me because I didn't have--if you didn't know, you just didn't know.  But Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Williams, which we only had for a year, they were good teachers, and they taught us, you know, I learned a lot from them.
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll change tape here, I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the teacher's name was Mr. Newton.  I should never forget that man--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was a math teacher--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, he did--I told him, I said, "I don't know this."  "Well, you know, you'll learn."
Story_ID: 73713
Speaker 1: We were talking about grade school [Willard Elementary School], we were talking about grade school and--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --so you started getting sick in grade school?
Speaker 2: No, no, no, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't.  In grade school, I was fine.  It wasn't until I was about six--I guess I was 16.  I was 16 or 17.
Speaker 1: You had already started high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My last two years is the ones that I had to keep making up, going back and making up.
Speaker 1: Now, well, tell us about high school.  You went to--
Speaker 2: I went to DuSable [High School].  DuSable was a very, very good school.  We had, our principal was Joseph Meegan [sic, John Meegan].  I'm proud to remember his name.  He was, he had been the principal at Willard [Elementary] School, incidentally.  And he went on to become principal of DuSable.  There were a lot of activities for black kids at DuSable.  We had Captain Walter Dyett who was the, he taught band.  He taught jazz and concert band at the school.  We had I would say very good, a very structural gymnastics and swimming and things like that.  The only thing, Mr. Newtson (ph.) was the person, he was a math teacher, and he never, ever helped me with math.  They didn't have after-school programs there.  We had theater.  All of the name musicians in the, the '50's [1950s], Walter Jaquette--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That's Illinois Jacquet?
Speaker 2: Illinois Jacquet, Lester Young.  They weren't going there.  They had all graduated from there [sic, neither Illinois Jacquet nor Lester Young attended DuSable High School].  And all of Lester--John Coltrane, they were all becoming famous but a lot of 'em received their musical background from Walter Dyett.  Nat King Cole was a friend to my oldest brother.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And, 'cause his family lived in Chicago [Illinois] then.  So high school was fun, high school was fun.
Speaker 1: Now, did you attend a--I supposed you attended the Regal Theater, right?
Speaker 2: Regal Theater, yes, yes, yes.  And Regal Theater had all of the stars from Sammy Davis, Jr.; James Brown; [HM] Eartha Kitt; Pearl Bailey; they were all doing things at that time, and it was real fun time.  And they would leave from over there and go over to Morris' Restaurant which was black owned and was real fun then.  I didn't--I was sort of in that, the younger age.  I couldn't do all those things, but I know they did 'em, and it was just something in the black community that we talked about and was very proud of.
Story_ID: 73714
Speaker 1: Okay, well, tell me about high school.  You started at DuSable [High School], and what did you--what subjects did you like the best?
Speaker 2: I liked English, sciences, geography, history was one of my favorites, history.  They had home economics, but they really didn't advise--when I went into high school, my pre-counseling before taking the class was, "you'll probably work as a domestic, and you don't really need to focus on one subject."  And the only college at that time was Normal's Teachers College [cannot verify] and Normal--it was Normal, Illinois, I think it was.  And the families had to be wealthy.  They didn't, they just didn't encourage you to go any further than high school.
Speaker 1: Well, how did that make you feel in high school?
Speaker 2: More determined to do something.  Those, when--I worked best under pressure, and especially if I'm challenged.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did you have any teachers at DuSable that encouraged you and really--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --helped?
Speaker 2: No.  In fact, I can't tell you the name of--oh, Mr. French.  I think he was assistant principal.  I don't know his first name.
Speaker 1: Okay, did the mood of the school seem like it was kind of, I mean outside of the music department where people were really succeeding on a national level, I mean was there a sense of excitement anywhere else in the school?
Speaker 2: No, no.  For me it wasn't.  They, we had lots of plays and lots of assemblies, and a lot of, I believe a lot of actors were, got their start there.  So that's the kind of school it was.  It wasn't a school like we would focus on children and on education, you know, and the things that they need to do.  The things that I would, I would do now, I read now an awful lot because I love it.  But then it was, it wasn't something that I had to do.  We didn't have homework every night.  And they had, the books that they had maybe one or two persons in the school had the book, okay.  And the teacher would give--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So not everybody had a book?
Speaker 2: No, no.  And they would put it, they would write it on the board and expect you to get it off of there in a certain length of time and listen.
Speaker 1: Okay, was, did you have a sense that DuSable was probably not funded to the extent that the other high schools in Chicago were or--
Speaker 2: DuSable, DuSable, Phillips [Wendell Phillips Academy High School][phone ringing], they were all the same.  [phone ringing] Sorry.
Speaker 1: DuSable, Phillips, were those the only two black--
Speaker 2: DuSable, Phillips and--well, Dunbar [Dunbar Vocational High School] was, was built and funded.  I don't remember if it was--I was think it was federally funded.  And what they did is they took most of the, a lot of the boys went to Dunbar because it was a vocational school.  And they taught 'em menial, I call, you know, I call it shop, a lot of kids did the shop.  And, and just anything that had to do more with vocation than with the kind of education that I really want.  And I was always a little ahead of my class, and it's not fun when people are dragging, and you know so you're ready to move on.  And I wasn't disruptive in the classroom, but I could have been because they were just moving too slow.
Speaker 1: It's frustrating.
Speaker 2: Very frustrating.  So I had a mama [Annie May Dean] that I could go home and tell the story to and she would talk to me, and things would get better.  And I just went back as a new person.  Had I not had that kind of background, maybe things would have been different.
Story_ID: 73715
Speaker 1: Okay, so you got sick when you were about sixteen?
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: And you were doing quite well.  It was really too easy, sort of?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the work was too--very easy, yeah.
Speaker 1: And--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Like we were behind all the time.
Speaker 1: And, but after the age of seventeen when you made this miraculous recovery, you resumed--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Did you go back to DuSable [High School]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, I did.  But I, it didn't--it was different, you know, and I was just trying to get through.  And I still had lost so much--I just had, not of the work.  I was just weak for a long time, just lethargic quite a bit, but I went back.
Speaker 1: So when did you come, when did you graduate?
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1955.
Speaker 1: And at the time you graduated, did you have a sense of what you were gonna do afterwards or where you were gonna go to school or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I wanted to go back to school.  I wanted, I really wanted to go to college.  So I'd take a course at--not Olive-Harvey [College] then, but I would take a course at, it was called, I would take a course at Loop [College, now called Harold Washington College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago] and there was a--Wilson Junior College [now called Kennedy-King College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago].  And I'd take a course, and I would work, and I'd take a course.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Till I got where I wanted to, and if at then, well you haven't gotten to that, then working with the, at my jobs, I always wanted to go back and get certified.
Story_ID: 73716
Speaker 1: Okay, so what kind of work did you do?
Speaker 2: I was a, I worked at the Chicago [Illinois] Health Department with the, in combination with the U.S. Public Health Service as a health educator.  I started out as a junior stenographer.  So I took the classes at Loop [College, now called Harold Washington College] and became a stenographer.  I went back and took courses in Allied Health and so what I did is, I would go out and lecture in the schools and give inoculations to the students.  And it was a very good job.  And it was fun until I went in the file, and I found that I was still getting the same salary for ten years, just a few pennies more very year.  And all of my, all of the Caucasians would get a tremendous increase where I would just get a few, just a few pennies.  So I quit.  But before I quit, I took the Civil Service exam for the City Colleges of Chicago, and I took a $1,500 cut in salary and went in as the administrative assistant to Samuel Huffman, who was the president of Malcolm X [College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago].  And I worked with him, and then I worked with the Dean as her assistant in continuing education.  And when she was, when she wasn't there, I took over (laughter).  And I did quite well.  And then I moved on from that college over to Olive-Harvey [College, one of the City Colleges of Chicago] and I worked at Olive-Harvey in the nursing department.  And I ended up in the physical science department.  And I enjoyed that very much.  I loved, health education is a very extensive career.  I could have just made a career out of it, but they didn't pay the, the black people like they did the others.  The guys would come in as my, to work with me.  I would teach 'em, and then in three years, they were my supervisors.
Speaker 1: That's not a good--let me ask, I suppose you didn't like that very much?
Speaker 2: I didn't like it.  I loved the people, and I knew what I had to do.  So I had to move on.  So in moving on, I just took another exam, took some more courses at night and started working with the City Colleges [of Chicago], and then from there, I went straight through.
Speaker 1: Okay, I wanna backtrack just a minute to--so you came out in '55' [1955].
Speaker 2: Um-hum, um-hum.
Speaker 1: So you, were you there when the basketball team, the famous DuSable [High School] basketball team, went for the state championship?  They didn't win it, but they were in--a lot's been written about it so that's why I raised it.
Speaker 2: I, I did and didn't do--since I wasn't as physically strong as I should have been, as I wanted to be.  So I didn't--I attend more football than basketball here, and I love it (laughter).  It's the part of my life that I lost.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's that famous DuSable team of '54' [1954], I think they went to the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --State Championship--they lost down state, but they were like legendary basketball team.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 73717
Speaker 1: Okay, so throughout these jobs, now, were you in--now, I guess I need to, I'm trying to like follow how you became a Reverend in some ways.  Did you attend church when you were coming up?  Did you--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, yeah.  That was the mainstay of our home, the church.  Black churches, it was the mainstay of the community, and what I didn't like was the, the hooping, as we call it now.  I didn't like that part of it, but I liked Sunday school, and I liked the music.
Speaker 1: Now, what church did you all attend?
Speaker 2: We attended Ebenezer [Missionary] Baptist Church when I was a little girl.  And then we moved to Zion Temple, and I stayed in that Zion Temple till I met [HM] Dr. Jeremiah Wright, Jr.  And I was very impressed with his ministry, and his style, and I could go home, and I would take something back from the church.  And so I started in Trinity [United Church of God] in 1975.  And--
Speaker 1: I didn't wanna get that far.
Speaker 2: Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 1: But just back to the childhood church, you said it was a lot of hooping in church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the pastors, they did what we call the "hoop".  You know, they--
Speaker 1: Can you do it for us?  Can you--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) No, I really can't because I didn't like it.  It was more of a performance, and I would rather give you food to eat than give you--feed you the word of God than you a performance.  I don't, the guttural, the guttural that they do in the black churches, you know, "I heard the Lord and he said to me, and, you know, you gotta get right," and, you know, that, to me, is--would be a performance, and I'd rather tell you about God and how good he is.  So I never liked the black church.  I would even, I'd go to the Catholic church with friends, and I didn't like that either 'cause I said, "My mother taught me, you pray to God."  So I couldn't handle that.  And, but I would go, so that I would learn a little bit about everything.
Story_ID: 73718
Speaker 1: Okay, do you remember the controversy in the Baptist church in the early '60's [1960s]?  I guess it took place late '50's [1950s], early '60's [1960s].  Were you aware of that at that time?  It had something to do with the nature of the church and what it should be doing, a split between Dr. King [Martin Luther King, Jr.] and Reverend Jackson, [Joseph H.] Joe Jackson in Chicago [Illinois], who was the head of the National Baptist--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Baptist Convention, yes, yes.  I remember that.  My feelings are, more or less were in Dr. King's cage as opposed to Joe Jackson 'cause I had gone to his church too.  And it was, it was just church.  You know, they, they spoke about God and they had the gospel singing which was another mainstay in the black community, is the gospel music.
Speaker 1: He believed that you should--church is for saving souls rather than helping people solve problems and that sort of thing and, on earth.  I mean and that seems, that's probably a simple way of summing it up, but that was the essence of the kind of conflict with Dr. King.  He said that we shouldn't be involved in politics or Civil Rights or to just--
Speaker 2: Okay, I can answer that two different ways.  Let me just answer it the way I would really like to.  If you learn and accept God as your Lord and savior, you will be obedient to him.  If you are obedient to him, you wanna learn more about him.  And as you do this, when things come up like--I don't wanna move too fast.  My, the denomination that I am presently in, in the United Church of Christ, I know that it's a lot of racism, but I don't make a fight about it.  I just try to do something with the small, intimate group that I have, that would make a difference.  Okay, so, yes, I agree with Dr., Dr. King.  I believed in his views, not necessarily all of 'em 'cause I've always been my person, my own person.  And I couldn't--I'm not the kind of person that can be led around with one group or the other.  But I favored Dr. King because I believed that he--in the Baptist church, they make their own rules, and they do their own things.  And Dr. King was straightforward in what he knew.  He was a gifted person.  If you listened to him, you knew that he was a man sent by God.  He was human.  He made human mistakes, but he was a man definitely sent by God, not necessarily one being paid by God--I mean paid by the community.  And Joe Jackson was one of those that was paid well for his services.
Speaker 1: So, in the days, in those days, in the early '60's [1960s], did you admire Dr. King and--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  At first, I didn't.  I couldn't understand it.  But my brother started to work with him during the Movement, and I became quite involved.
Story_ID: 73719
Speaker 1: Now, that raises another train of question, I guess about your father [James T. Wall] and your brother.  Your father and your brother were both involved in politics on some level, and in community activity--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and can you just tell us something about some of the things that they were involved in?
Speaker 2: Okay, my brother--my father was secretary to John Hamilton Lewis, who was quite famous in the early days of Chicago [Illinois] before my time, again.  My brother--and my father groomed and worked with William L. Dawson, who became one of the first black Congressmen in our time.  My brother worked with Ralph Metcalfe, and he groomed Ralph Metcalfe for his political career.  They started together with a gas station and they ended up very good friends.  And he, he groomed him, and he worked with him, and he showed them all the avenues of politics.  In the beginning, I wanted to work in politics, but my brother felt that I had another calling.  And politics wouldn't, it couldn't work, the two couldn't coincide.  And so I was always pushed away from the political arena.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what did your brother do?  He's quite an interesting person in Chicago history?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my brother, he--
Speaker 1: What was his name again?
Speaker 2: His name is Frederick P. Wall, W-A-L-L.  He was the owner and editor of the Chicago Courier.  And he was also very, quite active in politics, and he worked as an aide to Mayor Richard [J.] Daley.  And, in fact, Daley did his eulogy at the funeral.  He was the one that took care of everything.  He, he was a student at John Marshall Law School [Chicago, Illinois], and an ironic thing is, he was a very good friend of the, the founder, the person that this church [Albright-Bethune United Methodist Church] is named after, one of the persons, Mary McLeod Bethune.  And he worked closely with her.  So, my brother was a, he was like me, but he, he went to law school.  And he didn't finish law school.  He took, he did real estate, and he just did all the things to, that would enable him to work and to make money in a legal way, to afford his life and his family.
Speaker 1: Now, I believe he worked with [HM] Dempsey Travis, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Dempsey Travis wasn't just a friend of his.  They worked together.  John Sengstacke, Howard Little and the president of the Bingham Bank Building, they were three little owned--I'm sorry, Singleton his name was.  He owned the first little department store at 35th and State Street.  And my father's [James T. Wall] first factory was at 35th and State Street, and my brother had a real estate office at 35th and State Street.  I remember that.
Speaker 1: Okay, so--
Speaker 2: So my brother was very--they were both very much invested in politics, very, very much.  And they were considered leaders in the black community.
Speaker 1: Okay, and your brother passed in '73' [1973]--
Speaker 2: Seventy-three [1973], yes.
Story_ID: 73720
Speaker 1: All right, and now, what is the connection between the Chicago Courier [Illinois] and the Pittsburgh Courier [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: The Pittsburgh Courier is the second, was the second largest newspaper.  It came originally out of Pittsburgh.  And then they brought it to Chicago.  Fuller--is it George or John Fuller, Fuller Products?
Speaker 1: [Samuel] S. B. Fuller.
Speaker 2: S. B. Fuller, yeah, owned that, and my brother purchased it from him [sic, John Sengstacke purchased the paper in 1965].  And he owned the Courier, and he did all the articles and everything, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, this is a, you know, it was the second largest paper in Chicago--
Speaker 2: In Chicago.
Speaker 1: --black paper, yeah.  And it was quite a deal--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, yes, it was.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) with the Defender being so--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they, the Defender [Chicago Defender] did the sensational reporting, and my brother did the, he did a lot on academics, and the other kinds of circulation for a newspaper.  His wasn't as sensational as the Chicago Defender.  You pick up the Chicago Defender, and Joe Blow was beheaded the night before or gangland style, you know, but we didn't report that kind of news to the papers--I mean to the communities.
Speaker 1: More about development and issues and things--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's right, right, right.  And a lot about [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And the Movement [Civil Rights Movement], yes.
Speaker 1: So he was the, the paper was active during the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: What were some of the big issues in Chicago during the--
Speaker 2: The [Richard J.] Daley Machine, the Daley Machine.  You know, he--what they did is they tore down the tenement houses and put people in, in the black community, it's called prisons in the high rise, and that's when they built all of the Cabrini Homes [Cabrini-Green Homes] and the Robert Taylor Homes and put 'em together, and they took the homes from the black people in the areas and tore 'em down and put 'em--built those homes for 'em.
Speaker 1: Now, your brother was an ally of Daley.  How did he, how would he deal with the criticism of--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He worked in--he, what he did, he worked in the community.  If the community needed something, they would go to my brother, and he would go to Daley, and he would get--Daley was, Daley did a lot of good things.  But they did some--this is the second Daley [sic, the first Daley].  They did some very bizarre things, you know.  It was a racist, it was racist--excuse me, in, it was racist in a way.  But he would help the poor people.  He kept you needing him.  He kept you in that position.  I don't know how I wanna word it.  But that's what he did.
Speaker 1: Okay, so no substantive change, but some relief or something--
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was more relief than--yeah, yeah.  They, the jobs, you had to--he had his man in command, his son could go and do whatever.  And if it was a black cop that arrested him, he would have to go back and apologize to this kid, some of Daley's henchmen.  I know this for a fact, okay.  And they, they would--to me, it would be, I would feel very dishonorable and hurt that they would ask me to apologize to a 17 or 18 year-old kid, that had possibly killed someone and destroyed their property.  But they had to do it, but they--and needing work, they kept their jobs by being close mouthed.
Story_ID: 73721
Speaker 1: Like I said, I wanted to go into politics, but they pushed me out 'cause I didn't know it was that vicious.
Speaker 2: You did find out from your brother's [Frederick P. Wall] activities that Chicago [Illinois] politics is kind of a vicious subject.
Speaker 1: He kept it from me.  I used to, they used to have parties.  I wanted to go.  He wouldn't let me go.  And I stayed angry with him 'cause I thought that it was something--I just wanted to know how come I couldn't go.  And he said, "ladies don't go."  So that, that was it.
Speaker 2: Do you remember the incident with that dentist, the doctor--I mean dentist who was arrested by the police and brutalized by the police, who was a friend of Ralph Metcalfe, in the early '70's [1970s]?
Speaker 1: I remember it but not enough to, to go into detail about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, all right.  Real active, but a lot of things were going down--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: In the '70's [1970s], yes, it was, yes, it was, lots of stuff.
Speaker 2: So you, were you radicalized during the '70's [1970s] at all or do you think you kind of--
Speaker 1: Excuse me.  I did it.  I just taught at work in the ladies' lounge, in the lunchroom, what I wanted to put out there and hope it got there.  And I didn't, I've never been a radical in my movements, just in--I have a way of--or should I say I had a way of getting what I wanted out and getting what I wanted done without, you know, actively getting out there.
Story_ID: 73722
Speaker 1: Now, how did you end up attending a seminary and going into the ministry?  How did this happen?
Speaker 2: It came.  I just, I knew I had a calling, and when I was seventeen, I would take my bible and I would go around, and I would try to teach the Bible.  And they, you know, they said this wasn't what I was supposed to be doing.  So I just stopped and went on with my life.  And, but I knew I had this calling, and when I met Dr. Wright [HM Reverend Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.], that is when--and started attending Trinity United Church of Christ, that is when I knew that God had more for me to do.  And--
Speaker 1: Can you tell us more about Dr., Dr. Jeremiah Wright?
Speaker 2: Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr., yes.
Speaker 1: And what is the-- you know, how is Trinity United Church of Christ different from other black churches?  How would you describe (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Trinity is a teaching church.  It's Bible-based and spirit filled.  And it opens an opportunity for anyone that wants to come, to come and be a part of that church.  It is definitely not a cult.  It is a church where, if you are, if you need a friend, you could go to Trinity and find a friend.  There are 125 ministries in that church now.  When I started at Trinity, there was 370 members.  And when I left in '88' [1988], there was 4,000.  And it all, it came from word-of-mouth and actually being there and seeing what they were doing.  We started the employment ministry there.  We started a very lucrative singles ministry where a scripture was taught.  We did social things together.  We, we were a family within a family.  And we refer to them as our extended family.  That's how Trinity works.  Dr. Wright will go to extensive measures to get information for you if you--just so that all of his members will know what's going on in the outside world.  He first sees you--all right, when you start, you take the bible classes.  You take introduction to the Bible, and then you take the Bible classes.  And they're taught in a very simple manner the same way that I teach here.  And you get your Bible basis and then you go on to various things that--spirituality, love and the single father, family orientations and so on and so forth.  And it's, it's built on a very firm foundation.  It's a place that you wanna be when you're not at home.  Like I said, it's a home away from home.  And there's always something to do there.  It's always something to do.  You can go and walk in now and pick up a Bible class or you can go into the, the room, into the bookroom and read about your ancestors.  You don't have to guess about anything.  They have seminars.  They have, I would say they have twenty-five [phone ringing] ministries there.
Story_ID: 73723
Speaker 1: We're talking about Trinity [United Church of Christ] and your experiences at Trinity.  How did you find out about Trinity United Church of Christ?  'Cause you were a Baptist.
Speaker 2: Right, right.  I moved into the neighborhood in 1975.  And I had friends in the neighborhood and who invited me.  I also had a young lady, my girlfriend's daughter passed, and Reverend Wright [HM Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] did the funeral.  And he did it in a most unusual way.  He let the children do the funeral.  And I thought that was so amazing.  And I knew I wanted to get to meet him, and I introduced myself to him at the funeral.  And then I started coming that next Sunday.  And I've been, I, I stayed with him until I moved here [Pennsylvania].  Dr. Wright is the kind of person that will come at your bedside at Four o'clock in the morning just to make sure he got to see you that day.  Of course, the church wasn't as large as it is now.  And he has a staff of maybe twenty pastors now that assist him.  And he's, he's a teacher from his heart.  And that's what he does.  And that's what they do at the church.  They teach you and they help you.  They walk with you, they work with you.  They do everything that you need when you are down and hurting.  When you're happy, you can go and share your joys there.  And because of God's call on my life, and because of Dr. Jeremiah's teaching--in fact, I learned more from him at Trinity Church than I learned in four years at seminary [Lancaster Theological Seminary in Lancaster, Pennsylvania], okay.  He, he guides us through and he just takes you through and everything that he can find out, he, he shares it with the congregation.  And it's all about God.  It's all about loving.  It's all about being a part of something.  It's all about being happy with yourself and loving yourself, and taking care of yourself.  I brought forty members in that church, and I was very proud of it.  I just told 'em to come and see, and that's what they did.  And that church just grew.  And as a deacon in the church, we did everything but bless the sacraments.  And I had the opportunity to get up in the pulpit.  I knew that God had something more, more--I thought deacon was what it would be.  And I knew that there was more.  I had to do it my way because I am a, the kind of person that I thirst for knowledge.  I thrive on doing better.  And I just knew that God wanted me to--and since I wasn't a person that you easily turn around, that that's what He wanted me to know--do, because he knew I would teach His word, and He knew I'd be faithful to Him.
Story_ID: 73724
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did Reverend Wright [HM Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.] encourage you to become a minister?
Speaker 2: No, I told him I felt that I had the call.  And he took me through all the steps to make sure, and I told him, yes.  So what happened is I married [Morris E. Hart] and moved here [Pennsylvania].  And someone sent me a letter from Lancaster Seminary [Lancaster Theological Seminary in Lancaster, Pennsylvania].  It was called "Discovery Week."  And when I went there, I knew that that was what I had to do.  It's an all-white seminary.  It was two blacks when I started.  They give scholarships to help you with your seminary work, but you don't get nothing extra.  That's all, as a black person.  They never had over two or three blacks in the seminary.  And so, moving back just a little bit, I joined Trinity [United Church of Christ] and became very active in all of these ministries there at the church.  And then I moved here, and I went to seminary here.  The most tragic part of the whole thing is I felt, having had so much love at Trinity Church and being a part of the church and God's work, for somehow--somehow I got the idea that it was, this is what the church was about, the real church.  This is what I had missed as a child, although we went to church every Sunday, and we were involved in singing in the choirs, my sister and I.  And we did everything that way.  But when I got to Lancaster [Pennsylvania], and I went in for an interview, the chairman of the Harrisburg Association told me that as a black person, I never--I couldn't do it.  She, she talked against my staying in seminary.  And she said, "You don't have the background.  You can't do it."  And I told her, I said, "You just hang in there (laughter) 'cause I'm gonna hang in here.  And this is what I'm going to do."  And against all odds, I graduated in the three years' time that was allotted.  And when I got out, the tragic part was I found out that in this area and in most areas, the United Church of Christ is a white denomination.  And Trinity is the biggest, the largest church in the nation that's a United Church of Christ, and they respect them for that.  But I was told that the only jobs that they had were for forty, white with two children.
Speaker 1: Forty-year old men--
Speaker 2: Forty-year old males, with two children.  That's what they were looking for.
Speaker 1: Now, you're saying that Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago [Illinois] is the single largest church of the--
Speaker 2: In the whole denomination.
Speaker 1: --in the whole denomination.
Speaker 2: And they respect them because the money that they give to conferences--I don't know what it is, I've never inquired, is very large.  You go on, you know, what your budget is.  And Trinity is very supportive in the United Church of Christ.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But that's what they told me.  I went down in Virginia in the, the Eastern--the Southern Conference, and that's what the Southern area conference person told me.  I told him "just be real."  I said, "I've sent out applications for a position."  And I said, "why--you know, I never get a call."  And he said, "You want me to be truthful?"  I said, "Yes."  He said, "40--male, 40, white with two children."
Speaker 1: It's a formula he knows well.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yes, yes.  And then I, I didn't let it get me.  Like I said, I like challenges, so I just-
Story_ID: 73725
Speaker 1: I was a member of the Penbrook United Church of Christ in Harrisburg [Pennsylvania].  It's an all-German church.  They have a few blacks there.  The pastor is another unique person, Robert S. Stoudt, Dr. Robert S. Stoudt, and--
Speaker 2: How do you spell his last name?
Speaker 1: S-T-O-U-D-T.  And he worked with me, he encouraged me.  He got me in the Harrisburg Association Church and Ministry where I sat up and watched them take people that weren't qualified and put them in, send them to school, pay for their education so that they could come out and be a pastor in one of their churches.  But that didn't, that didn't deter me from what I wanted to do.  So one of the pastors, Reverend Donald Weitzel invited me to speak at his church to be his pulpit supply person, an all-white church.  And they accepted me for the Sundays that I did go in, in his absence.  And they put their arms around me, and it worked out fine.  It was, I wasn't gonna be the pastor.  So there wasn't a problem, but when I was there, they enjoyed what I did and the way that I minister.  And last year [2001], in April, they asked me to take a, an interim position at Faith United Church of Christ in New Cumberland [Pennsylvania].  And that area of Pennsylvania is called "White Shore."  That means that there are no blacks in that area, period.
Speaker 2: It's called "White Shore"?
Speaker 1: It's called "White Shore" by the people there.  And they tell you--
Speaker 2: That's why?
Speaker 1: That's why.  But they offered me an internship, and I stayed there ten months.  And I made more friends in ten months (laughter) than I had as an associate pastor at Bethel A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopalian] in Harrisburg [Pennsylvania].  And then I got a call to come here [Albright-Bethune United Methodist Church] at the same time.  But I had given my word to Faith United Church of Christ, and I told them that I couldn't take this church if I had promised to go as an interim to another church.  And the (unclear) said I was crazy.  That's just what she said.  "You're crazy."  I said, "Well, I must--I don't have anything.  I'm black.  I have my word."  I said, "that's all I have and my integrity.  I said, and I must take this church."  And so I took it, and I gave her a little note.  I said, "If God calls me to Albright-Bethune, that's where I'll be."  And I said, "You can get an interim or whatever you wanna do."  So February of this year [2002], she wrote me again and asked would I take this church.  And I told her, yes.  And they invited me up, and introduced me to the pastoral relations committee.  And they accepted me on the spot.  I had, in the United Church of Christ, I had, had the opportunity, the conference minister who is Dr. Lyle Weibel and Dr. David Greenhaw, invited me to go to Germany as a delegate to the Penn Central Conference.  And they sent me there, and I didn't have to pay, spend any money, any out-of-pocket money.  And I was there for three weeks, and so that was on my record.  And then I had gone to Berea, Kentucky, in a small church program.  And they paid for all of that.  And so I had all the experience, and I had six years at an African Methodist Episcopal [A.M.E.] church as an associate pastor.  And so they took all of that into consideration, and they accepted me here.  And while here, we have been moving by leaps and bounds.  I have three new members.  I've only been here since June the 23rd [2002].  And I have three new members, and I had approximately ten to come in yesterday, that said that they wanted to become a part of this church.  This is a multicultural church.  I teach the Bible.  I teach love, I teach spirituality.  And that's what we do here.  The children, the young people from the university--and I'm doing this just to, to let you know how we're working, it is an all-white choir.  And they want to come in and work at the church and be a part of our church.  And I have a pianist that's gonna work with us.  He's a music major at the university [Pennsylvania State University in State College, Pennsylvania] and it's just a wonderful church.  And it's made up of mostly professors at the university and their families and students in the Doctoral and Master's program.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, the church is Albright and Bethune--
Speaker 1: United Methodist Church.
Speaker 2: --United Methodist Church.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Who was Albright and--
Speaker 1: That was Jacob Albright.  And he was one of the pastors that worked in the beginning of the United Methodist Church.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And Bethune being Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune, and that's what I was saying.  It's so ironic that they called me, and I had known Mary McLeod, not as a personal friend, but my brother [Frederick P. Wall], through my brother.  And so the connection is there, and our prayer was for, "If it's for me, I'll get it."  And we are moving.

Speaker 1: Now, what is your philosophy of, I guess, religion?  Do you have a philosophy about that?
Speaker 2: I think it is the ultimate part of life.  I think--well, let's put it this way.  First of all, religion is like, it's a--if you say my theology, I could answer that better--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Unclear) maybe--
Speaker 2: --'cause religion is just groups of people with their own little rules and regulations, and the Baptists, the United Methodist, Episcopalians, the Catholic church and if you look at all of them, they're all different, but similar.
Speaker 1: So then I'd probably ask you, what is your theology?
Speaker 2: I believe in God.  I believe that God is the, the Alpha, the Omega.  I believe in the Holy Trinity.  I believe that God is--God gives the orders.  Jesus follows and that the Holy Spirit guides you.  That's what my theology is.  And I love what I do.  I love people, and I've never been happier than I am at this point in my life, although my family is mostly deceased.  But I am happy.
Story_ID: 73727
Speaker 1: Now, you came to this area [State College, Pennsylvania] because you, your husband [Morris E. Hart]--
Speaker 2: I married [November 27, 1987] and moved here.
Speaker 1: Oh, you got married?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And, what's the biggest difference, I guess, between State College, things like State College and Chicago [Illinois]?  You lived in Chicago all your life (laughter)
Speaker 2: In Chicago, they don't tell you anything.  They just don't do nothing for you.  In State College, they, they tell you what you can and can't do.
Speaker 1: "They" meaning?
Speaker 2: "They" meaning the townspeople and the hierarchy in the area, the people that actually run everything.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, have you been told what you can't do here?
Speaker 2: Not yet (laughter).  But I've told that it's very close-minded, and I have had the opportunity to work with the assistant provost and the football coach--basketball coach.  And that's Dr. Terrell Jones who is--he's just a guy for all seasons.  He's a wonderful person, and the church is his baby.  And he works very hard here to keep it going and the football coach--basketball coach, Jerry Dunn, is, he's a very personable, a very wonderful person.  And they all, they just work with me and they help me take, they helped me to take my little baby steps.  And now, they're just there for me.
Speaker 1: Are they members of your--
Speaker 2: They're members of my church, yes, yes.  And they have just--they treat me more--they respect me as their pastor, but they treat me as if I'm a relative, yeah.
Story_ID: 73728
Speaker 1: Okay, so, is the black community here, I guess, close in State College [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 2: Not necessarily because it's multicultural.  I mean it's, it's like this church [Albright-Bethune United Methodist Church].  In the pastoring and preaching and teaching at this church, we're multicultural.  We, we bring all people in at their, at their own level, at their own place.  And we, I try to help you to get where you want to be as opposed to where I think you should be, because the most important part is where do you wanna be?  What is it that you want?  Do you know what you believe?  Do you believe what you know?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay, and, and that's how I do it.  The, I live in an all-white neighborhood, and I'm the only black in the whole surrounding neighborhood.  And I don't have a problem.  They don't treat me any different.  But I don't actually have interrelations with them either.  I'm there.  They know I'm there.  They've made me welcome, and that's it.  The churches, the large churches in the area stick together.  But since I've been here, I've been able to pull in the Mennonite pastor, David Miller, the Unity Church pastor who is Harold McKenzie, and trying to get the Assemblies of God pastor in with us.  So we do things, we do things citywide.  We do things community, and that's what I'm trying to pull together here.  And that's what we're doing.
Speaker 1: What do you think is-now this church is growing, you said--
Speaker 2: Yes, when I came they--last year this time, they were going to shut the doors of the church in October [2001].  And what I did when I--they called me in June, and I wasn't supposed to start till July.  But they wanted me to come sooner.  And the problems that they had were people problems.  And what I did is I called 'em all together, those that they weren't getting along with, the church, the hierarchy in the church, and I made them say--I made them, I asked them to come and that's what they had to do.  And we served communion to the congregation.  And we were in communion with each other and communion with God.  And that brought 'em all together.  They apologized for wanting to shut the doors last year, in six months.
Speaker 1: Do you have an idea why the people are (unclear), what you--well, what have you done to really revitalize the church?
Speaker 2: To leave, to bring people together as one, to let them know that this is not a white church or a black church.  This is God's church.  It's neither my church or their church, and it is, it is--to base it on, like I said, on Jesus in the church.
Story_ID: 74192
Speaker 1: We met him down there traveling with Dr. Wright [HM Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr.], and he, he started--he worked there as a musician in the church.  And God put a call on him, and he went to seminary.  And I just enjoy--when I talk about people like, I mean I just, I just love what they're doing.
Speaker 2: You're talking about Ozzie Smith.
Speaker 1: Ozzie Smith, yeah.
Speaker 2: In Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 1: So his church is growing.  It's not--I don't know if it's in the thousands, but I think it is.
Speaker 2: That's United--
Speaker 1: No, that's the United Church of Christ.
Speaker 2: United Church of Christ.
Speaker 1: Um-hum.
Speaker 2: Okay, do you think you're gonna be here for a long time?
Speaker 1: I would like to.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I would like to.
Speaker 2: Okay, all right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause getting on the staff a Trinity [United Church of Christ] is like part of the entourage, you know, now.  And Dr. Wright is probably, not too far back in his mind, gonna retire, you know.  And, so he's put all young people in power.  Everyone that was sixty-two and over is retired.
Story_ID: 74193
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns about the black community?
Speaker 2: I would hope that the black community find out, decide who they are, whose they are and what are they going to do about it.  I think the black community could rise up again as a people of integrity and a people of faith and people with hope because there's a lot of darkness in the community, with the gangs and the drugs and things like that.  You know, they--I know for a fact that most of the people that are locked up now are young blacks for selling dope.  And what, what has happened is that we know that they didn't go over there to the poppy fields and get 'em.  And that the, the white man brings it in and sells it to 'em, and, and I--and they--this is a way of life.  And they feel that twenty-one is, that's the end of life.  I, I thought when I was so sick that I wouldn't live to be thirty-five.  But it wasn't because of gang relations or the lifestyle.  And now, they don't care.  Twenty-one is the magic age, and I have done in depth studies on drugs and, and the community and you live three years if you sell it, possibly.  If you live longer, that's--that's your gift.
Story_ID: 74194
Speaker 1: When you look at, over the years, the transition you've experienced, what do you consider as your legacy?
Speaker 2: That I accomplished my dreams against all odds.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did your mother [Annie May Dean] get a chance to see you become successful as a minister--(simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  No.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No.  None of my relatives really.  The, I mean of the, my generation.
Speaker 1: Did your mother pass when you were about--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: She passed in '68' [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a son [Frederick]--
Speaker 2: I have a son, yeah.
Speaker 1: --who is still in Chicago [Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah, he lives in Chicago.  He has three children.  His youngest son is attending the IMSA Academy, you know, the Illinois Math and Science Academy in Aurora, Illinois.  He's an honor student.  He's a State honor student.  He maxed out the State--he beat the State in, in percentiles every since, I guess sixth grade.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I have a granddaughter that, she's attending Georgia State down in Statesboro, Georgia [sic, Georgia State University is in Atlanta, Georgia while Georgia Southern University is in Statesboro, Georgia], and I have another grandson that just became a minister, a youth minister.  He's gotta go back to school and get everything he needs, but he became a youth minister.  My brother, Fred [Frederick P. Wall], did ministry.  But, like I said, ministry and politics don't work.  But in his heart, he--he was ordained, an ordained minister.
Story_ID: 74195
Speaker 1: Okay, now, this is slightly different, this question is, but how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I would like to be remembered as a person that loved the Lord and that loved my fellow man.  And I believe that you can make it, black or white, in the world, if you have God at your side and you're determined.  I would like to--I'd like that to be my legacy.
Story_ID: 74196
Speaker 1: What if--just one last question here.  How do you feel about the megachurches?
Speaker 2: I feel that megachurches are like supermarkets.  And each one has the various sections for you to--and I'm gonna use the term "eat out of" because when I think of church, I think of learning the word of God and ingesting it and being able to spew it forth.  And the megachurches are, they're becoming like supermarkets or malls.  And everyone is doing different things, but they're doing it--the pastor and the various departments.  And it's not like a church, like the church that I came up in or like Trinity Church [Trinity United Church of God in Chicago, Illinois] is.  And Trinity hosts, I think the last numbers on the gleaners are 29,000 people that have been through those doors.  And they are, they're not churches where--there're churches where you could get lost in.  You just, you become a part of one section of the church.  But you're really not in connection with the church.  You're just doing, going off doing your own thing.  And that's how megachurches appear to me.  If you have a spirit-filled, Bible-based church, and you do have a lot of people, then you fit them in to be a part of things and not just put them off to their selves.  In some churches, they want you to bring in your income tax statement so that they can--(laughter), yes, they do, if you wanna be a part of "that" church.  They, they want to know about your insurance policies and what is your contribution to the church, what are you gonna do?  It's more like how much can we make and how many nursing homes can we build, how many hospitals can we build?  It's like an organization.  That's where I see the megachurches.  Now, all large churches, I don't consider megachurches.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you give some examples of some?  Can you name some of them that you would consider megachurches?
Speaker 2: Johnny Coleman in Chicago [Christ Universal Temple], Bishop--what is his name?
Speaker 1: Brazier.
Speaker 2: Brazier [HM Bishop Arthur M. Brazier-Apostolic Church of God].
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Um-hum, those are megachurches, like department store churches.  You can't do anything unless you do it our way.  And it shouldn't be about "our way".  It should be God's way.  And that's the only way.
Story_ID: 74197
Speaker 1: What about the role of women in the ministry?  How is that changing?
Speaker 2: It's changing.  It's really changing.  In the Baptist church, the roles we know--you and I both know as black people, we know that the woman is the stronghold of the church.  We know that.  The women, they take care of all the planning and most of the food and organization of the church.  For women of color, it's, it's--they're opening up the seminaries, but they're not getting the positions.  There is still a high-risk of your actually ministering after you complete your seminary training.  The man, the black man became somebody when he became a pastor or a preacher.  And it's in every ethnic group.  They actually call themselves "somebody," and they are resenting the fact that women are getting out of their role of behind them and wanting to be like them, you see, as pastors.  And it's very discouraging.  Most women are chaplains in univer--at universities and hospitals and prison ministry.  But they don't get the opportunity to actually have a position as a pastor in a church.  They do not, unless they start their own churches.  Most, like I said, most women are doing other things, and those are the kind of things that they invite you to do when you get out or you'd be good at any ministry but parish ministry.  And in the Baptist church, they have stopped ordaining women, black and white women.  In the Episcopal Church, they're letting in more women now to be priests, and you know about the Catholic Church, so I don't wanna, yeah.  The Catholic Church was one of the, in my day, they were racist.  They didn't even want you there.  And now, today if you can pay, they want you there.
Speaker 1: Okay, have you experienced a lot of resistance at this--well, any resistance, I guess--your experience here has been mostly positive (unclear)--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You mean in State College [Pennsylvania]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But have you experienced any resistance as a black woman as a minister--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure, sure, sure.  I was the associate pastor at Bethel A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] Church for six years in Harrisburg, [Pennsylvania].  And they just didn't, they used me as an assistant pastor, but that was all.  I mean I couldn't do any of the pastoral work there.  And that is, that's an A.M.E. church, and they, they have a lot of people they call ministers, women, but they don't ordain them.  They keep them out as much as possible.  And I really think it's a male ego that has more to do with it because they say that women, the bible states that women are not supposed to preach.  But if you read, when Jesus was resurrected, the first persons that he spoke was Mary and Mary Magdalene, and he told them to go and tell the good news, that I'm alive.  And that's what we're doing.  We're telling the good news of Jesus Christ, and as women.  And it makes no difference what your--if you're male--your gender is.  It makes no difference.  So that would be my answer to your question, due to the male ego, it's very hard for women in ministry.
Speaker 1: Okay, well, thank you.
Speaker 2: You're welcome.

Speaker 1: That's my sister, Katherine [Wall].  It was shortly after her graduation from high school, and she was on the telephone, taking interviews for jobs.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, now, we're gonna go to the upper right.
Speaker 1: And that's my son, Frederick when he was a little baby.  And he's just--that's my son, Frederick.

Speaker 1: That's my mama [Annie May Dean].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, do you have any idea when that was taken, what year that might have been?
Speaker 1: I would say 1959.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, and then we're gonna go to the lower left.
Speaker 1: That's, that's my son, Frederick.  That's me in the center.  That's my nephew, Vernell.  In the front on the left is my nephew, Maurice, and my niece, Marion.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, and then for each one, if you could also tell us when these were taken, approximately or exactly?
Speaker 1: I guess that was maybe 1970.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: It was my birthday party.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, and (unclear) the lower right.
Speaker 1: That's me, that's my sister, Katherine on the left, and that's me on the right.  And that was approximately 1942.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, great, next.  You wanna hand that back to me, a description for this photo.  We can see that it's Fredrick P. Wall.  And this photo was--when was this taken?
Speaker 1: June 23rd.
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventy-three [1973].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, 1973.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  But do you--was it--now, that's when it was, okay, that's when it was--
Speaker 1: The picture was done maybe a year or two earlier.  That's how he looked when he passed.
