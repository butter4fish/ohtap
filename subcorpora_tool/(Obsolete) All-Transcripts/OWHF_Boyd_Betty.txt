 Nykolaiszyn with the Oklahoma State University  Library. Today is Friday, February 22, 2008, and I am in Tulsa,  Oklahoma interviewing Betty Boyd. This interview is being conducted as  part of the Inductees of the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of Fame Oral  History Project. Betty Boyd was inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s  Hall of Fame in 1996. For over twenty-five years, Boyd served as a  friendly face on Tulsa television at stations KOTV and later KTUL. After  working in broadcasting and marketing, Boyd turned to politics and was  elected to the Oklahoma House of Representatives in 1990 and served  through the year 2000. Thank you for joining us today.  Thanks for asking me.  Well let   s begin by learning a little bit about your early life. Could you  tell us where you grew up?  Yes, about two miles from where you   re sitting now. I was born in Tulsa  and have always lived here up to this point and don   t plan to go  anywhere else. Went to Pershing Elementary School which is no more,  it   s not a school anymore. Went to Roosevelt Junior High School which  is now an elementary school. Graduated from Tulsa Central High School  which has moved from its downtown location, so all my schools have  been displaced except the University of Tulsa and Iowa State University  at Ames.  Grew up with being raised basically by six women   no men in my life  at all. I haven   t had a dad since I was less than a year old, and Mother  never remarried so my mother, my grandmother and her five unmarried  sisters all thought they were my mothers, and this was fine. (Laughs)  Loved to read as a child. My mother could have taught this table to read  so I was exposed to reading although she was not my teacher, ever. She  did not wish to do that or even teach at the same school where I would  5  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  be attending, didn   t think that was good.  But I loved to read, partly because I guess when you   re raised by  women, you don   t do a lot of the things you do when you   re raised with  a man in the house. We never went camping. I still consider camping out  going barefoot in the Holiday Inn. I just, didn   t do a lot of things, but I  did love to read. I was not well as a child at all, and so I had to sit still a  lot and read. I was born an adult and stayed that way, I guess. Had a  good childhood   loved living in Tulsa, never have wanted to live  anywhere but here. Love to travel now, but I want to live here.  When you were younger, what were some of your favorite subjects in  school?  Well, anything but math. Is that a shock? I always do creative math. I  consider if I get five when I add two and two, that   s creative. My teacher  said it was wrong. Let me think. I   ve always been interested in history. I  like to read all kinds of books, but the things I most particularly have  always enjoyed are either history non-fiction or   a lot of the non-fiction  seems like fiction   or historical novels or this kind of thing. I   m a real  history buff and always have been, so I suppose like most other little  girls in pink dresses and straight stringy hair, enjoyed reading. So I  enjoyed English. I enjoyed history. I enjoyed science. I wasn   t good at  art, so drawing   didn   t enjoy that. Loved to give book reports. Loved to  get up in front of a crowd and speak, although I was and am bashful,  probably because I was an only child in a house full of grown-ups. So  I   ve just been bashful. (Laughs)  Well, when you were younger, did you have any hopes or dreams or  ideas as to what you wanted to be when you grew up?  Yes. In fact, that   s why I went to school, to university where I went. I  wanted to write. I knew that. I loved journalism when I got to that point  in school. In junior high, we had a junior high school paper at that time  and I loved writing for that, that kind of writing, not books although I   ve  done that some since. So I wanted to be an editor of Better Homes and  Gardens or a magazine much like that because I was also very interested  in home economics   for good reason, by the way. But I thought if I took  the combination of home economics and technical journalism, I would  get the best of both my worlds. Got married instead and got an even  better world (Laughs) so I never did do that, but I wanted to be a  journalist, but not for a newspaper.  And of course when I was growing up, it   s obvious there was no such  thing as television. There was radio. We didn   t listen on crystal sets or  anything, but we were a little advanced by the time I came around, so I  6  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  had no thought of that. And I certainly had no thought of going into  public life and politics, although I love history, but   bashful   told you.  (Laughs)  Now you said, for some reason, home economics   why was home  economics important to you?  One of these aunties who lived in the home with me   my mother, my  grandmother and this aunt and I all lived together in a house here in  Tulsa. The other aunties lived in Missouri but were here a lot so helped  raise me. The auntie who lived in this house was a professional dietician.  And she, in fact, is the lady who later went to Columbia University, at  the request of the Raytheon Corporation, to teach their engineers what to  do with this thing they had that would cook but they didn   t know what  kind of recipes to use, how much liquid to use, if any, what kind of  spices, how long it would take. Aunt Margaret went to Columbia, in  New York City where she had gotten her master   s degree, and taught the  Raytheon Corporation what to do with the microwave oven, they   re in  ninety percent of American homes they tell me.  So I always grew up around somebody that liked that end of this world. I  didn   t want to teach. My mother and all my other aunties were teachers,  and I saw what low salaries they had   wonderful rewards otherwise, but  I   m too much of a gypsy. I wasn   t sure I wanted to go in a classroom at  8:00 in the morning and not come out until 4:00 in the afternoon or 3:00  in the afternoon. You know, I wanted to run around and talk to people,  like you and, even though I   m bashful, I still wanted to do that. The  home ec part came from Aunt Margaret   s influence, I   m sure, and all my  family. I grew up in a household of the best cooks in the world   so, why  not?  Are you a good cook?  Yes. I   m not bashful about it. (Laughter) Yes. I still am, even though  now I just cook for me. I don   t enjoy that as much as when I have my  family over, and, incidentally, all my family now live here   my two  children, their children and their grandchildren all live here except for  one. I don   t know how he got away, but he moved to Florida a few years  ago, but the rest of them all live here.  Was your family very supportive when it came time for you to go to  college? Did they encourage education?  Oh, my, yes. And, remember, I   m an old broad and my mother was not  young when she married, nor young when she had me, and like I said, all  these aunts were in some way connected with a school, and Aunt  7  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Margaret later with the university, very strongly. There was no question  that I was going on for advanced education. There was some question  when I wanted to get married before I finished school, but that was okay.  They were extremely supportive because in that day it was a little  unusual for women to have a degree, much less an advanced degree and  all but two of these aunties had master   s degrees and were working on  others later. I didn   t ever have any PhD   s or EdD   s in the family, which  didn   t seem important to them, but they still continued to go to summer  school.  Now you started out here at the University of Tulsa?  Yes, because when I got out of high school at just barely sixteen, my  mother said I couldn   t go farther than across town on the bus to school.  (Laughs) University of Tulsa didn   t offer the combination I mentioned  earlier about technical journalism and home ec   they had no Home Ec  Department. They had a Journalism Department, but they were training  newspaper type people   city paper type people   but I did go there as a  freshman. There were only two schools that offered what I wanted to  take, that combination, Iowa State and Cornell University in New York.  Mother said,    You can never go to Cornell.    Now I don   t know why  because she received her master   s from Columbia University in New  York also, but she said,    No, no, no. That   s too far away, but if you will  go to the University of Tulsa one year, we   ll talk about Iowa State.    We  did   I did   and then I got married. (Laughs)  Did you meet your husband in Tulsa?  Yes. He also went to Central High School, but he was a couple of years  ahead of me. Central High School in Tulsa was so huge, although I knew  a lot of people there, no one knew I was anything but part of the wall. I  was very young when I went to Central and not interested in boys     never had been around boys in the first place. I thought they were just  ornery things that were around for some reason. But I just started there  very young and so he didn   t know me. I knew him, but I met him on the  bus coming from the University of Tulsa back to town   to Tulsa   one  day. We were both out there.  Were you married when you went to Iowa State?  No. No. No, I was just seventeen when I went to Iowa State that second  year, so I   no (Laughs) but I was married at 18-1/2.  Was Iowa much different than Oklahoma?  Not today. (Laughter) It was cold. This day in February when we   re  8  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  doing this is cold. Yes, it was. In fact, it started snowing   that first year  it started snowing in October, and we had snow on the ground   I don   t  mean it snowed every day but, like this much snow, not just this much.  We had snow on the ground every day through March, and this was  highly unusual. No one could have a car on campus, and the campus  there is beautiful but it   s very hilly. I remember sliding up and down  hills in my little shoes I had been to a formal dance in many times and  wearing everything we could get our hands on. It   s cold in Iowa.  (Laughs)  Now after Iowa, walk me through     What happened then?  Yes.  When I went to Iowa State, it was in the fall of 1942 and, if you   no,  no,    43   if you remember in the winter of    41 something rather  traumatic happened in this country as far as World War II was  concerned. That summer, the fella that I had learned to care for very  much, who became my husband later, enlisted in the United States Army  Air Corps, and that fall, I went to Iowa to school. I stayed there for a  year, and the following summer of 1943, he and I were married. We got  engaged that summer, and he graduated with his wings. He was a pilot  of a B-24 four-engine bomber. About three months after we were  married, he went overseas   was based in Italy and flew fifty missions in  that B-24 and came home fortunately and was fine until four years later  when he and our daughter had polio, and that was another story, but not  too spiffy.  But we did meet at the University of Tulsa, then he went to the Air  Corps and I went to Iowa State. Then we got married, and then after he  got out of the service, we did go back to the University of Tulsa together  because that   s where he wanted to go. He was taking engineering and he  wanted to go there and I never was, and I   m still not, liberated enough to  run in the house and say,    Oh, honey. I   m going here. Are you going  with me?    I   m not   although I grew up where all women worked and I  guess I was thought of as a liberated sort of person but I   m really not.  I   m just not. So I wasn   t gonna do that, and if he wanted to go to TU, I  did, too. Then we had a child. After we   d been married   let me think     three years   I guess, four years   three years we had our little girl and  then the following summer she and her daddy both had polio, and he  was totally paralyzed for quite awhile.  Well we   ll get back to that in a second. I want to go back to the war  years for a second. I read somewhere that during World War II you  9  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  worked in a Tulsa bomber plant?  Yes. Yes.  Tell me a little bit about that.  (Laughs) Well, I needed to do something. My husband was overseas and  at that point I really didn   t want to go back to the university. I knew  probably that he and I would go back when he came back and I felt very  confident he   d come back, by the way. I just   I held that thought, I   m  kind of a positive person, and I held that thought always. But I wanted to  do something. I wasn   t gonna just sit at home and do nothing and     although as an officer in the Air Force, he was making pretty good  money, I wanted to do something. So, like a lot of other people, I  applied at Douglas which is now the Tulsa   well, let   s see, it   s been  several things. It   s that big long building out by the airport and it was  huge to me as a little    ole gal at that time. And so I applied at the Tulsa  Bomber Plant.  Now I wasn   t    Rosie the Riveter.    I worked in the office but I did work  the swing-shift, which meant I went to work at 3:00 in the afternoon and  worked until midnight, which was fine   I wasn   t going to date or go  partying anyway. My husband of a few months was overseas, so I  wasn   t gonna go do that. (Laughs) So I did work out there, but I worked  in the office   enjoyed it. It was exciting for me to be a part of the war  effort in that way   little as it may have seemed, it still was my  contribution. But I wasn   t on the assembly line or anything. I worked in  the office. I wasn   t that aggressive. (Laughs) I didn   t do that.  But you contributed nevertheless.  That   s right. (Laughs)  Now in the forties you worked with the March of Dimes.  Yes. My, you do know a lot about me. (Laughter)  What was your role with them?  Well, I started that because I mentioned my husband and my daughter  had polio. And at that time, he was back at the University of Tulsa and  our only income was because he was getting money on the GI Bill to go  to school. You got a little stipend in addition to getting your tuition and  books paid. Well, when he was totally paralyzed and in the hospital, that  ceased to be. I had a little girl at home who was just a year old, at that  point. Also, I was the family dummy and didn   t really know how to  10  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  really make a living for everybody. I needed to stay hitched pretty well  to the hospital with Bill. He was there for about a year and a half. And  our little girl needed my care. So I thought,    Well, I   ll just be a  homebody, but we can   t pay these bills   huge bills.    And the March of  Dimes came to Bill and me and said,    We want to pay your bills. That   s  our role.     At this point, the March of Dimes was doing that sort of thing only.  They have another mission now.    You don   t have to pay us back,    they  insisted. Well, as a matter of fact, Bill   s folks did pay them back  eventually, but nobody asked them to, they didn   t have to. But I still  wanted to do something for them, and I thought,    Well, I like to speak.     So I kind of got on the speaker   s circuit of going around to women   s  meetings mainly   PTA   s, garden clubs, anybody that would have me     and talk to them about what to look for as signs of possible polio.  Remember, this is before any vaccine at this point because it was 1948,  and Jonas Salk   s name wasn   t even familiar to anybody at that point. So  I went around telling people how to keep their    kiddo   s    from being as  exposed. They closed school here for months at a time, and you weren   t  supposed to go to movies or anything where you   d be in a crowd, don   t  go swimming   lots of do   s and don   ts.  Did that and then when Jonas Salk came out with his trial vaccine, Tulsa  was one of the places that did the trial. We had to talk parents of second-grade  children into letting those children take part in it. So I continued to  speak on behalf of the March of Dimes then, and then later I was on the  local chapter executive staff, the state chairman, and then I was on the  national volunteer board of the March of Dimes. And so that   s how I  started meeting a lot of the people that I came to love very much. Dr.  Salk was just, you know, right over here (Laughs) for me. Beverly Sills,  who was very active in the March of Dimes then, and I worked together,  people that a little    ole girl from Tulsa thought she   d just always read  about, not ever meet. So it was quite an experience, but that   s how I  really got started in everything I   ve done since was because of my  volunteer work with the March of Dimes.  Really? So did that lead into your television career?  I had a friend who was working in the promotion department at Channel  6, and she called me one day and she said,    I know you have been giving  lots of talks,    which I had for several years.    Our woman   s broadcaster   s  leaving   she   s getting married and moving. Wouldn   t you like to come  audition for her show?    and I said,    Heavens, no. When?    I knew  nothing about television at all   or radio   never been in either one, and  as I told you, I   m bashful. So I did go down and I did an audition. I said,     What do I do? I don   t   what do you want me to do here?    and she said,  11  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd     Oh, talk about anything you want to, and then sell something for a  minute.    So I did. At that point, my husband was working with Kerr  Glass in Sand Springs, and he had me convinced that you could not  possibly, can vegetables and fruits without using the wonderful grey  sealing compound around the seal of a Kerr Glass jar, so I sold a Kerr  Glass jar.  The next day, they said,    Come back and do a live on-the-air show as a  live audition,    and after I got through losing my breakfast, I did that.  Somebody else did the same sort of thing the next day, but I don   t know  whether she died or left town or what, but I got the job. And it was just  because this friend of mine knew that I had given lots of talks on behalf  of the March of Dimes. So I always like to tell youngsters today,    Don   t  fail to volunteer for anything you can. Just doing that is way plenty for  you in satisfaction, but it might lead you to the most wonderful job  anybody could ever have,    and sure enough, it did.  Now after your first audition, you were hired. Do you remember your  first time in front of the camera?  Oh, yeah.  Tell me about it. (Laughs)  Well, of course the first time was the live audition   they meant a live  on-the-air show that was sandwiched in between a local news program  and a national soap opera, which meant we had to join network right on  the dot. There was none of this lag-time or anything that television was  kind of used to in the early days when national television wasn   t such a  big deal. They said,    Bring your own guest.    Well, fortunately for me     this is one reason I remember the first time really   this aunt I  mentioned, who did the microwave cooking research, was here for the  whole month of December. It was a holiday for her. And I said,    Aunt  Margaret, guess where we   re going in the morning?    (Laughs) She said,     I don   t know,    and I said,    You   re gonna be on television with me,     and she didn   t know any more about television than I did. She knew  about microwave and the fact that the television and microwave ovens  both ran on the same sort of a megatron tube, that   s about it. But she  knew her business, and I was fascinated by microwave cooking. I just  couldn   t believe that a potato could bake in just a few minutes and be  done, or that a cake   I could look in there and see it go up, you know.  So she was my first guest but I really did lose my breakfast, for several  days. It was scary. I had   yeah, I   d talked to rooms full of people, but  I   d never talked to a thing like that without any response. I can   t tell if I  need to say something funny when I   m talking to that. I can when I   m  12  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  talking to you or if I need to be quiet or be loud or what. Well, you can  with a live audience. So, yeah, I was scared and I did toss my cookies  before I went on the air, but then I interviewed Aunt Margaret and did  two or three commercials after that. They loaded my show so I got so I  did two or three interviews in every 15-minute show, plus four or five  commercials in every show, and I did all the commercials live. In fact, I  always did television live and liked it   but, yeah, it was   yes, I do  remember (Laughs) vividly.  Nowadays we have teleprompters and pre-taping and not a whole lot is  done live except for maybe the news now. Is live television hard? Did  you have scripts in front of you?  Yes and no. Yes   well, it is more difficult because you can   t have     overs.    All we had when I started was film, and the only reason they  used film was on a news story with limited use then because it was very  expensive. You use film once and throw it away. That   s a pretty  expensive process. So until videotape came along, everything was live  except for a few news film clips. Once in awhile, in my role at the  station, I would go do an opening night at Tulsa Opera or something of  that sort that was community-based. It was also newsworthy because the  wife of the editor of The Tulsa World happened to be one of the guests,  so it was newsworthy. But until then everything was done live. It was  hard, yes, because you couldn   t do it over if you made a mistake. You  just flat made a mistake and it hung out there for everybody to see and  hear (Laughs) and I made some    doosies       and things unexpected  happen.  The funniest stories that I ever have told people about television days are  the unexpected things that happened to us on the air live. Live television  is exciting because it   s there. It   s real. You know it   s real and you just  have a rapport with that funny-looking thing out there and you pretend  like you can see all of those millions of people you are absolutely sure  are watching. So no, I prefer live, always did, always will. I do think you  can do a more perfect job if you can take sixteen times to do a 30-second  commercial, for instance, to get it just right, the way they want it. But  there   s just something about doing it live. It   s like living life. I want to  do it in person. I don   t just want somebody to tell me it was nice, you  know.  Do you remember some of those old products you used to pitch?  Oh, sure.  What were some of them?  13  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Oh, all the Wilson Meat products, for instance   bacon, ham   I suppose  that was typecasting. I remember Maxwell House coffee. Much of what  I did in the way of commercials on my show were things that were local  because it was a local show about local people and visiting guests. In  fact, I wrote down a list, not too long ago, of all the guests that I could  remember that I   ve had. It took up about four pages and I thought,     Good heavens, how could I be that lucky?    I told you I was part of the  wall in high school. Well, I was and I (Laughs) kind of still am, but I just  was lucky because of what I was doing to meet all of these wonderful  people. But that   s what my show was really about was local things. So  we had a lot of local advertisers. All of the local department stores here  would advertise things.  But in all of that time that I was on television, and still today when I do  commercials occasionally, nobody has ever asked me to do anything that  wasn   t the best or the best price. Sometimes those are different things  (Laughs) but I was never asked to. I guess no one would have believed  me if I had told them to buy something or to use something that wasn   t     okie-doke    because I   m believable as one kind of person, but I   m not a  tire-kicker or a fender-banger. I   m just not that kind of a person, and it   s  pretty obvious, I guess. (Laughs)  Do you have a favorite moment from your television days you   d like to  share with us?  I have favorite moments.  Well tell us some. (Laughter) That   s fine.  Most of them are surrounding something that was totally unexpected to  me. One day I asked a lady   remember, I   m doing all of these live  now   I asked a lady a question and she went  falls over    and I  thought,    Good lands, I   ve killed her,    but she had fainted. I guess she  was so frightened, although most of my guests normally were not by the  time we got in the studio. I   d always meet them in the lobby and we  wouldn   t talk about what we were gonna talk about on the air because if  you do that and then you ask them that on the air they think,    Oh, I   ve  already answered that,    and they get this    la    look on their face. They  usually were pretty comfortable, but this lady for some reason was  uptight and she just flat fainted right on the air. Well, that was   in that  way   a favorite moment.  Another favorite moment was when I had   and it was funny   I had a  little lady on who was talking about a county fair that they were  holding   not the state fair, but a county fair   and she was darling. As I  remember her, she was about the age I am now, which is pretty old. She  14  Nykolaiszyn  had a little hat on, reminded me of Mary Poppins. I expect it had a  flower on it, I don   t know that for sure, but a little flat hat. She was so  dear and so precious, and she made rugs. So she was talking about this  county fair and her part in it and so forth, and I said,    Well, Mrs. so-and-so,  how long have you been making rugs?    This darling sweet little lady  looked at me and said,    Oh, honey. I   ve been a hooker all my life.     (Laughter) Well, you can   t come unglued when you   re on live. When the  lady fainted, I just let the camera man pick her up chair and all and carry  her off and I went on doing my job, they were doing theirs. I learned a  long time ago that if you do your job and depend on other people to do  what they   re supposed to do, it   ll happen. And so when this happened, I  couldn   t just fall apart with laughter with this lady. I could see the  camera man and the camera going like this  makes up and down motion   because they were laughing so hard. And she looked at me and went on  with it and said,    Well, my mother taught me to be a hooker when I was  just a little girl.    Well, it just went downhill from there.  Actually favorite moments have to revolve around the people who came  to be interviewed. I was just as entranced and enthralled, honest to Pete,  with people from here and by here I mean across the state of Oklahoma  who would come to talk about their projects. My favorite dear  moment   one day I had a therapist and one of her little clients about     yay    tall, probably about four years old, from the Speech and Hearing  Association. And this little child had been profoundly deaf all its life and  it was a darling little boy, just darling. Of course all little boys are  darling I found out later after I   d started having them. He had not spoken  because of his deafness. She was demonstrating with a feather in her  hand here to teach him to say,    mother         th,       th,    th      giving this  action. If you   re deaf and haven   t heard, it   s difficult, as Helen Keller  showed all of us. And he was sitting on set with her and momma was  back in a chair off-camera, and the therapist was trying to get him to do  this    th    by blowing    th    the feather. And he looked at her and these  eyes, and I swear they were this big and they were beautiful blue eyes,  and he said,    Mother,    and his mother jumped up out of the chair in the  back of the room there and just,    Oh     That, probably, without doubt  was my dearest moment, that I saw this little boy who had never spoken  his mother   s    Mother    name, do it on the air, and there were just lots of  things like that. I   m a    schmaltzy    little old lady and I like things like  that, but it   s all been fun. It was all fun. In fact, I   ve never done anything  that wasn   t fun. Some things I liked better than others. I obviously don   t  balance my bank book. I told you I didn   t like math, and I still don   t find  that fun, but any work that I   ve ever done I like, and it   s full of  memories. The whole thing is full of memories.  What was your last day on full-time TV like? I know you   ve had stints  since.  15  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  I can   t tell you what that show was about. I can tell you that the people  at Channel 8 where I was at that point   KTUL-TV   were wonderful to  me and I was not fired. I left under my own steam because I really  wanted to do something else, and I had another, what I considered, plum  job. People said,    Oh, you   re leaving the best job in town.    Well, yeah,  probably, but I was also going to the best job in town. So it wasn   t a sad  thing for me to leave because I was going someplace I wanted to really  go to do something entirely different. I was going to be the public  relations and marketing director for the Tulsa Technology District. Of  course, our CareerTech system here in Oklahoma is wonderful and I had  always wanted to do that, and had interviewed their superintendent  several times. In our off-camera conversations had said to him,    If your  PR gal ever decides to retire, I want to apply for that job,    and he  thought I was kidding. Well, I wasn   t kidding at all. I really wanted to do  that.  I   m back to my journalism again not home economics, but back to my  journalism. I had done television for 25 years at that point every day     every day, every holiday, every, all the time because I always did it live,  except when I did finally take a vacation and they let me pre-tape the  shows I had, but I was still doing it. So for 25 years, every day I had  done television, and I wanted to do something different. So I wasn   t  unhappy about leaving, not at all. If I   d been fired, I   d have been   I  don   t know if I   d have been unhappy or just mad (Laughs) but I wasn   t  unhappy. I was happy to be going where I was going, just like when I  left there after 10 years. When I left Tulsa Tech, I left there because I  had gotten elected to the legislature. I couldn   t hold both jobs because  they were both paid partially by the state government. Couldn   t do that. I  wasn   t unhappy about that because I didn   t get fired there either, got  fired from the legislature when somebody beat me after 10 years,  (Laughs) but I was never unhappy about leaving. Long answer, short  question   I cannot remember my last day, except I know it was joyous,  happy, and we had a lot of fun. They gave me a lot of plunder the day I  left and a big tape that they had put together of a lot of the shows that I  had done at Channel 8 and that kind of thing.  Well moving to the Tulsa Tech district, tell me about some of your daily  activities working in that role.  What anybody else does in public relations and marketing; the image  of   it was called vocational technical education at that time. We were  Tulsa Vo-Tech instead of CareerTech. Nationally that name has changed  for all schools like this. So I did whatever you would do in any other  industry to try to promote the school   wrote articles, prepared all of the  promotional materials. Had a great rapport with the    kiddo   s    and the  instructors because, here again, it was all positive. It was something that  16  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  they wanted to have happen. Vocational education was not thought of as  for   everybody said,    Oh, isn   t that wonderful, for everybody but my  child. My child   s going to college.    Well, what we had to sell people on  in those days was that even if your youngster was planning to go on to  college or university or for post-secondary education of some sort, that  was good. Even so, they could get good background, good platform  from which to spring and perhaps a way to help make part of their  tuition money for college. Well, of course, now we even give concurrent  enrollment. So that   s all changed today, and I   m on their school board  now and I can tell you it has changed dramatically since the days that I  was there. We tried to make people understand that vocational education  isn   t just for those who can   t do something you consider pretty    spiffy.     It   s for those who are trained in a different way. Those who generally  learn more by doing than just by sitting down and reading about doing.  They live more in the real world when they   re in school than those who  don   t have that experience.  It was a sell job, so I did the things that anybody else did that was trying  to sell an idea   try to upgrade and dignify more a way of education and  try to prove to people that one size doesn   t fit all in education. It doesn   t.  It still doesn   t. It doesn   t today. So my daily activities were just as what  anybody else would do   a promoter, an informer of opportunities and  this kind of thing, and I loved it, just loved it. Got to use my journalism  skills again, or whatever they are   I guess they   re skills   quite a bit,  and became very, very interested in photography and did that a lot which  I had never really done before except just for my own amazement.  (Laughs)  Well how did politics enter the picture?  Well the man who had the seat that I eventually held in the House of  Representatives moved out of the district and also decided to run for the  Senate about that time. He called me one day just before filing time was  over in the summer of 1990, and said,    I   m leaving this House seat. Why  don   t you file for it?    and I about fell out of my chair. I was like I was  about,    Why don   t you audition for television?    I   d never, ever thought  about being in politics. Never. All those years I had a show, didn   t have  confrontation on it. If people were against   let   s take the ERA,  Equal  Rights Amendment  that was going on, trying to ratify the ERA for the  state of Oklahoma. Those for and those against were never on my show  on the same day. I   d have them both, but I don   t like people sitting on  radio or television yelling at each other about something. Nobody  benefits. You don   t do anything   you don   t even listen to what the other  person is saying. I don   t like that, but I wanted both sides.  I never put a political sign in my yard as long as I was on television. I  17  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  just couldn   t have a public opinion about a private subject. That   s just  not what you do. So I never, ever thought about being in politics, just  like I never, ever thought about being in television. But I did. I can   t tell  you what made me decide to. Yes, I can. My nice husband said,    You   d  be good at that.    Of course that ornery    pot-hound      we were in  different political parties, and we did take a lot of teasing about having a  mixed marriage. He was a very active member of his party. I was not a  very active member of my party. We were registered in different parties  on purpose so we could go to all the precinct meetings, vote in both  primaries and then when it came to the general election be very  independent and voted for whomever we wished regardless of party,  which we both did   or he said he did. I didn   t go in the booth with him,  but I   m sure he did, and I did, and I   m sure he did, too. But anyway so I  thought for whatever reason he just said,    Well, you   d be good at that,     and he had said that to me about television. He really kind of pushed me  into both of these things.  So I filed and I had four opponents in that primary, but I came out of it  without a run-off. Then I had a general election against a member of the  other party and won that and it just started. I found out that legislative  work, policy-making, is my real thing. I still would miss it if I were not  on the school board, because we make policy. That   s what school board  members do. They make policy. The school superintendent and his staff  carry it out, but the board makes the policy. I like policy-making, and I  loved the legislature. Obviously I like to talk, so I like to debate. I don   t  want to yell. I don   t want to do that. Yeah, I can get angry, but I still  don   t want to yell about it, and I don   t want anybody yelling at me or  calling me names or anything. That   s not statesmanship, but taking the  best of this and the best of this and putting it to this so that you have  something that you can really applaud over   that   s statesmanship and  that   s what I like to do I found out. (Laughs) Still like it. (Laughs)  What were some of the issues that you were really passionate about  when you were serving     In the legislature? Well, I was not only passionate about, but most noted  for, I guess if noted is the right word, those who didn   t like the  legislation didn   t think I was noted, they thought I was nuts, but that   s  okay. I started the Reading Sufficiency Act, which at that point,  although it   s been modified several times with different aspects,  improved in some ways and not in others, but it was insistent that if  children didn   t learn to read early   they must learn to   let   s put it  positively. Children must learn to read and read well early in their school  life or they   re probably going to be a candidate to drop out later because  you don   t do well at anything if you don   t have a good base in reading.  So the Reading Sufficiency Act was even copied as a national model. I  18  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  liked that.  I set up the Department of Rehabilitative Services as a separate agency  because they were in DHS  Department of Human Services , and DHS  had so many things under its umbrella that they needed to be.  Rehabilitative needs are a little different than entitlement needs are. So  we set that up, and I liked that. Did a lot of work with the disabled folks,  a lot of work with education, started this school. I carried the House  version of OSU-Tulsa to establish this school, this university here in  Tulsa   pleased about that. Did a lot of work with the medical  communities   a lot of breast cancer work. Set up the Breast Cancer  Fund, revolving fund, to assist women who were either uninsured or  underinsured and raised the awareness of the necessity for having early  detection of any kind of cancer, but most particularly, at that point, the  Breast Cancer Fund. That was highly successful and very emotional.  So health, education, the welfare of people, those were my general  things. I know nothing about agriculture. I was born in the middle of  downtown Tulsa practically so I know nothing about agriculture, so to  speak. I   m not stupid, but that   s not my thing. Obviously I   m not very  astute about banking and finance. I know nothing about the insurance  agency except that I carry it, and I need it and all this. So there are  several subjects that I participated in by voting, because you have to  learn about them and vote, but they were not the things I was passionate  about. It was the education of our children and lifelong learning. It was  those who had rehabilitative needs or had special needs we   ll say.  Children, anything to do with children, early education or the  abolishment of child abuse inasmuch as is possible and this kind of  thing. Those were my really favorite things, along with helping the  Oklahoma Medical Association with many projects, particularly in the  cancer field. That was about it.  That   s pretty good for 10 years.  Yeah, they were full   and I never lost a bill, ever. I was pretty pleased  about that. I was very lucky in many respects, I   m sure. I was the first  great-grandmother to ever serve in the Oklahoma House of  Representatives (Laughs) and I was a great-grandmother at that time. I  thought that was pretty nice. Age   your effectiveness doesn   t  necessarily depend on your age or your gender. It doesn   t. When I went  over there, there were only five women in the House of 101   only five  women. I wasn   t there because I was a woman. I was just there because I  got elected. So I never felt discriminated against. One little reporter one  day said,    Well, are you going to play in the golf tournament that the  fellows are having?    and I said,    No, I   m not.       Well didn   t they invite  you?    I said,    Well, I don   t play golf. That   s why I   m not going. You  19  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  know, if I hit something and chase it myself, you   re gonna have to put  me in the funny farm. I just don   t do that. So that   s why.    But people  thought that women were looked down on in the legislature. No, no, I  didn   t have any problem that way. In the first place, I was enough of a  grandma to paddle them if they had done that but (Laughs), corporal  punishment or not  But I never felt looked down on or put upon because  of that. I never expected any special privilege. I knew how to debate and  I did my homework on my stuff and I carried good measures or I  wouldn   t have carried them and I was proud of that. And I   m sorry if  that seems pride-filled, but I was very proud of never having lost a bill  the 10 years I was in the House and I carried a lot of measures   not the  first year. The first year I sat and learned, but beyond that I carried a lot  of stuff   but it was all good enough to pass.  Do you have that one, or several, moments that just really stick out for  you during your time in the legislature?  Well the one was the day we had the debate on the Breast Cancer Fund.  Normally, even though (Frosty Troy commented on this one up in the  press box) normally the House is a little rowdy. You get 101 people in  there on the floor at one time and, in the first place, most of them aren   t  paying a lot of attention because a lot of them have read the bills  already. They don   t have to pay attention to the questions and not even  to the debate. A lot of them get up and go out to meet with constituents  in the hall while somebody   s talking or debating or something.  This particular day when the breast cancer thing came up, it was as  though   the old thing about    you could drop a pin and hear it in the next  room      it was so quiet, it was almost a reverent experience really. There  was one man in the House who was bound and determined that that was  not going to pass because abortion caused breast cancer, which he told  me on the floor of the House when I was explaining my bill and what it  was for and it just made me do this  motions . Because they knew on the  House floor that I had had breast cancer twice. In fact, I had it once  while I was down there. One of my episodes was while I was in the  legislature, so they knew I was going down to take radiation every day  before I came in to go to work at the House. They knew I was passionate  about it, and here this    ya-hoo    got up and started yammering about  things that had nothing   really that wasn   t his only thing, but you  know      if women behaved themselves, they wouldn   t have breast  cancer,    and all this kind of junk. Well, they asked who wanted to  debate this bill, and this man held up his hand and he wanted to debate  against it. Almost everybody else in that room raised their hands. They  wanted to debate    for    the bill. Well that in itself was a shocker to me. I  knew I   d have some good supporters, but almost every person in that  room wanted to debate    for    the bill.  20  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  That was enough really, but then when the debate happened, it was so  quiet that it was almost scary. People listened to every single word that  was said passionately by many of these people who had had family  members or good acquaintances who had had breast cancer. They related  part of what they   d gone through, but most of all why this was so  necessary. And I will never forget the reverence, really, in the attitude of  that whole House during that particular debate. It was and is very dear to  me and I appreciated. Of course I loved all these old guys anyhow, but  even that one over there that was giving me trouble (Laughs) but that   s  something you never forget. Not just because other people in the room  were seeing a subject the way I saw it but just because of their total  involvement and acceptance of the situation and why it needed to be  fixed, insofar as it could be. It was wonderful, just wonderful. That   s my  big moment in the House.  Based on all of the careers you   ve been involved with, from mother to  television broadcaster to marketing guru to community member involved  in many activities, can you go into detail about a key moment that you  consider one of your biggest highlights?  That   s hard. (Laughs) I told you, I liked it all and I still do. My memory  bank is so full it   s just unreal (Laughs) of all of them. They haven   t all  been great, good and wonderful. I remember the    icky    ones, too. When  you   re in public life, and I   ve been in public life all my life really,  people are going to feel very free to criticize just as well as they applaud,  and I remember those moments, too. I try not to make those my priority  moments, but they   re always stuck in here somehow. When somebody  says something real tacky about what you   re doing or what you believe  or    Your opinion is wrong.    No,    That   s still my opinion. You may not  agree with it, but it isn   t wrong. That is still my opinion of something.     They   re very free to tell you this, so I don   t want to make anything of  that sort my moment that I remember, but those are moments you can   t  forget. You simply cannot erase those. You can overcome them, and of  course the good has been way ahead of the obnoxious.  Really, I cannot pick out a moment, and I could not tell you one of those  careers that was better than any other except   and I   m not blowing  smoke, I mean this. My family, regardless of all these careers, my family  has been at the center of my life. I   m a good cook, I told you that   love  to cook for my kids. Went to every activity they were ever in, and the  grandchildren as well and the great-grandchildren now. I still go to all  these elementary school little plays and the junior high school band  concerts that they   re in and watch them cheerlead and play football and  get smashed and all of that stuff. My family really is at the center of  everything I ever did, and my support came from there first of all  because they all had to participate. When you   re on television, your kids  21  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  have to participate by being better children than they might have thought  about being. They couldn   t go out and go speeding up and down the  street. They can   t do that if they   re in the family of anybody in public  life. You just   you don   t do that. You   re not supposed to anyway, but  you really can   t do that and I don   t care what I have done, it   s been  pretty public. I don   t think I have a secret in the world from anybody  who lives here. I just don   t (Laughs) and   well, maybe one or two.  (Laughs) But you can   t have, and you can   t have if you   re in politics.  Somebody will dig it out. You can   t do the things that you might have  done.  My family always kept me on an even keel and they always brought me  back to reality.    Oh, mom, go sell a hot dog at the football game    or  something, that kind of thing. They always kept me well-centered. When  I   d get down, my wonderful husband who really supported me always     and I   m sure he got tired of being called    Mr. Betty Boyd      I   m sure of  that because I   m just sure. But he never really let it show, but he kind of  resented that. But we all have egos and we like to be recognized for what  we are, but he always promoted,    You can do that, Betty. You   re ready  to do that. It   s fine to do that,    because I was always   I didn   t stand in  the corner with my thumb in my mouth, but I was always kind of bashful  about especially trying something new. So family has got to be my  whole center point. Other than that, all the memories are wonderful, but  they all kind of get glued together.  Now you   ve pioneered television. You entered the legislature later in  life. You   ve done a lot of key things. Tell me about any stumbling blocks  or adversity that you faced along the way, if any.  Oh, most of them were within myself. Here again, it comes from that  business of being a timid, bashful, loner child. Being an only child is  something different and particularly when everybody else is going to the  father and daughter banquet and you   re not going because you don   t  have a dad. I guess that has been a stumbling block for me, just to get  over the fact that,    yeah, you can do this, and if you make a    boo-boo,     it   s okay.    I don   t like to make    boo-boos,    that   s why I collect them. I  have a whole collection of    boo-boos    because I made so many, and I  think it   s great when somebody else makes one. So I have a whole  collection of them, but I don   t want to make an error. I don   t think I need  to be perfect, but I don   t want to make an error, mainly because I don   t  want to make anybody mad. I   m not good at that, although there are  those who will argue with you (Laughs) because I am not bashful about  expressing my opinion on something if I feel strongly about it, this I   m  not but learning to control my opinions and listen to other people.  Listening to other people is no problem to me, but learning to take the  value of their opinion and, not adopting it necessarily. I still have my  22  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  strong opinions, but that   s a stumbling block to me. I always want to be  right, not because I think my opposition doesn   t know anything, but I  want to be right, and that   s a stumbling block when you have that. I  think people want to be too perfect, too good.  It was a little difficult when I went to the legislature because I couldn   t  find a place to park because the sergeants would always   for the first  about month they would come up to the side of the car in the parking lot  and say,    I   m sorry ma   am. These spaces are reserved for legislators.     Well, I qualify.    Is your husband in the legislature?       No, I am.    It has  been a stumbling block being a woman in some of the things I   ve done  because when I started in television there were almost no women in  television, almost none at all. None on the news and almost none overall.  Anyway, when I started in the legislature, there were almost none   none  that were from out of town anyway, the ones that were there all lived  around the Oklahoma City area. That has been a stumbling block.  I think the biggest stumbling block just has been to convince myself I  could do whatever it was they   d hired me to do. I loved to give   I still  do a lot of public speaking, every week, but I always think,    Gosh, I  hope I say what they want me to.    I lack some confidence. So any  stumbling blocks I   ve really had have been from lack of confidence  within here. I haven   t had any major flops, except not winning an  election, but I didn   t throw that all on my shoulders. But I really haven   t  had that many stumbling blocks.  I   ve had that much encouragement to get over whatever I thought might  keep me from doing what I wanted to do. That   s not to say my life   s  been perfect, but I just haven   t had the big   I   ve never been rich, I   ve  never been pretty. I don   t have to get over those things that I don   t win     Miss Everything.    I   ve never run for    Miss Anything    except     Miscellaneous    or    Misinformation    or something like that. I really  think just lack of confidence in myself has probably been my biggest  stumbling block.  Well in 1996 you were inducted into the Oklahoma Women   s Hall of  Fame. What was going through your mind when you were notified of this  honor?  Who? Me? Although I had a little preview of that. In 1985 or    86, I   d  have to go look on the plaque, I was given a special award by the  Women   s Hall of Fame as a    media pioneer    and that startled the socks  off of me. The Women   s Hall of Fame was a little bit new then and I  remember that Mae Boren Axton was one of the inductees then and I  thought,    Oh, wow,    and one of our lady Supreme Court judges was an  inductee that year and I was going,    Oh, my. What am I doing here?     23  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Then they came up with this special award, as a    media pioneer,    I was  not inducted into the Women   s Hall of Fame then. I probably wasn   t as  startled by the Women   s Hall of Fame thing as I would have been if that  hadn   t happened, if I hadn   t had that 10 years prior to that time. What is  the old thing?      I should get up here and tell you how humble I am, but  I   m pleased as punch      that was kind of my reaction then. Everybody  likes acceptance, don   t we? I mean, I think we do, and that certainly was  a show of acceptance and I take it for that, not applause, applause,  applause, not that. But    We accept you for what you were able to do,  and maybe it wasn   t the greatest but you did it well    or whatever. It was  just pleasant, but I was just pleased as punch. (Laughs)  Did you attend the ceremony?  Oh, yes, oh, yes.  And did they have presenters back then where they would   the person  who nominated you would stand up and give the speech and make you  feel all warm and fuzzy?  Warm and fuzzy? (Laughter) They didn   t really have the people who  nominated you, probably. George Nigh got up and said some awfully  nice things, but he and I have been buddies forever. (Laughs) Yes, they  did, in a manner of speaking, but it wasn   t necessarily the persons or  person. I have no idea who nominated me. I don   t know that.  So you remembered who introduced you?  I think it was George Nigh.  Okay. Did you have a lot of supporters in attendance?  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Did have. My family is always present,  every time I would get something   and they should be. They   re my  pushers. They   re the wheels on my wagon. (Laughs) Gee.  What does this type of honor mean to you?  You know, when you   re in public life   and by that, I don   t only mean  the careers that you   re paid for, but when you are a community volunteer  and   everything I   ve done, whether I   ve been paid for it or whether I do  it as a volunteer, has been a community-based effort. Television for me  was an effort to promote my community and the organizations in it, or  the people who came to town, but part of promoting them was that I  wanted them to see how great Tulsa was. Of course when you have  public speaking engagements, those are always community-based even  24  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  though they may be in Oregon,    that funny little lady from Oklahoma is  here to talk to us today      or in New Jersey, because I   ve done this all  over the country. When you do those things, you expect people to like  you or they wouldn   t have asked you to do them, but my whole life has  been community-based, really. Promoting my community or people in  the community and I think that   s just the whole thrust for me, and so to  be honored by anybody within the community is marvelous.  Well how do you feel that now people look at you as a role model?  Boy, they   re nuts. (Laughter) Well, I would like to think that I could be a  good role model and yet when I see some of the role models we have  currently I think,    Oh, no thank you.    (Laughs) But I would like to think  that I had somehow   and I haven   t died yet, and I don   t plan to for  awhile   but I would like to think that some of the values that I learned  as a youngster somehow have got so ingrained that they just lurch out. I  want people to be polite to each other. I don   t understand road rage. I  don   t understand people punching each other in the nose. I just grew up  in too gentle an atmosphere, partly because it was all women. I would  like to think that anything that we do now in the way of manners and  respecting the personal property of somebody else would somehow roll  into being a role model for someone, or several someone   s. I don   t know  that it will. If that part of me, now there   s part of me that I hope nobody  follows, (Laughs) but I hope that those things that I grew up with and  had pounded into me softly and gently and lovingly   I don   t mean any  other way   as just part of life. I just accepted that you were nice to each  other because that was what life was all about, and I   d like for that to  become a role model for somebody else. I don   t know that it will.  Now if you could give advice to your fellow Oklahomans, what would  you tell them?  Stay here. (Laughs) Be proud of your state and where you are. I did a  long time up at Channel 8, I did a whole series of public service  announcements. The idea was to tell people how great this part of the  state of Oklahoma is. Of course, I think of the state as a whole as my  playground really, I mean, what   s good for Tulsa ought to be good for     Bugtussel    and everywhere else. Even though what I really was  promoting was Green Country here in northeast Oklahoma. And I  became even more entranced by this wonderful state and its people. Of  course, I think Oklahoma people are the secret to why Oklahoma has  progressed as it has really, and we   ll either continue to or we   ll not,  depending on what its people continue to do or not. But I did this series  of commercials, or public service announcements, out at Channel 8 all  based on how great this state is, and I could only do that because I think  that. I really honestly believe it, and I want other people to believe it  25  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  enough that they want to stay here. People say,    How do you keep your  kids here?    Well, I laugh and tell them I put a    yoyo    string in the  middle of their back and when they talk about moving, I just give it a  yank, but that   s not true. The yank comes here. You live in a wonderful  place that has all of the advantages really and, if it doesn   t, maybe you  need to work a little harder to make sure some of those advantages  happen. (Laughs) But my advice really would be just    Be proud of your  state. Stay here. Make it even better.     You mentioned your family and your husband. Would you like to  mention anyone who helped play an important role in your life?  Other than my family?  You could include your family.  Well, all of my family, even when we   ve had, as every family does, a  few disappointments, those teach us   what is it?    There is no sunshine  without shadows.    That   s true. My mother and I were unusually close,  probably because I didn   t have a dad after I was a year old. She didn   t  re-marry and she had no other children. Yes, she had sisters and a  mother, but we were really very, very close. So I would have to say, as  corny as that may sound to some people, my mother was a huge  influence on me   huge influence in my life. If I could be as good a  public relations person as my mother was, oh, I could have made a  million bucks. (Laughs) Various people who taught me things, both  formally and informally, as teachers and just as friends have taught me a  lot and been a great influence on my life, and still will continue to be.  Like I said, I haven   t died yet. I   ve got a lot to learn yet. I couldn   t name  one without probably leaving out a hundred important ones, so I   m not  gonna do that, but actually this whole community of folks have helped  me. I couldn   t do it without them. And all the famous people that I have  gotten to meet and the unusual things that I have gotten to do were only  because of the job I had, and the reason I had that job was because the  people let me keep it. If they hadn   t liked me, I wouldn   t have kept any  job I   ve ever had. You just, you don   t do that in the jobs I   ve had, and so  just people in general have been my support system, but my family in  particular.  What does Oklahoma mean to you?  Home. I think   and when we started this, I told you that I was born here  and have always lived here, and have always wanted to live here. I   ve  never wanted to live somewhere else. Oklahoma to me is home. It   s  where I   m comfortable. The state of Oklahoma offers me just exactly  what I want as a base. Now, I travel all the time, and I still do. I get in  26  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  my car and drive to Wisconsin every year. I drive to Florida every year.  I love to travel, but I want to come home   and that   s what this is, this is  my comfort food. The state of Oklahoma is my comfort food. It   s kind  of like a big bowl of macaroni and cheese or pork chops and biscuits or,  you know   it   s my comfort area. Opportunity? Yeah. Who would have  ever thought that a bashful little girl, who was much too young to be in  high school when she was there and was part of the wall literally, could  do the things that I   ve had the opportunity to do. This state let me do that  and the people in it, and I think they   re wonderful   Well, what   s next on the agenda? What are you working on now?  Whatever comes along. I   m enjoying my school board work very much,  and I have a few years left on my term. I probably will not run again  because I am, after all, eighty-three years old at this point in my life and  while I have as much energy as most people much younger, I still   it   s  time to do something different. Also, I don   t do anything for a real long  time. Television is the longest I ever did anything   25 years of that, and  then 10 years at Career Tech as an employee and ten years in the  legislature. Now I   m on several boards   Board of Health, Library  Board   pick one, but I   m a worker in those. I don   t just stick my name  on them. I   m a worker in them or I don   t belong to them. So down the  road, next is going to be a continuation of just what I   m doing I   m sure.  Trying to take care of myself and the most beautiful cat in town, and  take care of my    kiddo   s,    still want to travel some more. It   s hard to  live on Social Security and travel much, but I try to make it happen.  Traveled all of my life, even as a little bitty girl, and I like to do that so I  expect I   ll have more of that in my future, and I   d still like to have a  working job. Do you know of any available? (Laughter) I really would. I  have always earned a living. It seems funny not to, really. It not only  seems funny, it seems a little binding when it   s time to pay the bills.  (Laughs)  Well is there anything you would like to add that we have not spoken  about today?  Oh, I don   t   good heavens, I   ve probably spoken about more than you  ever wanted to know about me; but I don   t think so. I   ve just had a fun  life and I expect I   ve done about everything that I ought to be doing so. I  didn   t tell you about the real fun in my life.  Well what   s the real fun in your life?  Things like writing books and things like landing on and catapulting off  of an aircraft carrier. I haven   t told you about those things. (Laughs)  27  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Well you know   now I have in my notes that happened in 1969   the  aircraft carrier. How did that come about?  (Laughs) I was a member for three years, which is all you can be a  member of this   of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the  Services. And they had taken some military ladies to do this thing, but  they decided they wanted to take three civilian women. So they picked a  couple of gals   one was a journalist in Oklahoma City, and I   ve  forgotten what the other one did, and they picked me. We flew down to  Texas and then from Beeville, Texas we took off in a prop jet plane and  landed on the Lexington aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Mexico and  catapulted off of it the next day. (Laughs) That was fun. We were the  first three civilian women to do that. You know, I never could have done  that if I hadn   t just by chance been appointed to that committee, and by  chance it was because of what I had done on television and in my  community that I got to do that, and it was by chance that I got those  jobs. When I stop and think about it, I   ve always been reasonably  financially poor. Nobody ever had any money in my family ever and I  still don   t. But I   ve been emotionally and psychologically and job-wise  very, very rich accidentally, and it   s pretty amazing to me   I mean, I  think it   s fun. (Laughs)  You mentioned about five minutes ago    unusual    things. What   s the  most unusual thing you   ve ever done? You alluded to it, but     The most unusual thing?  Sure. Sure.    Unusual    came out of your mouth and I   m wondering, well  what could possibly be so unusual?  Well, because I   ve always been so bashful, anything that has to do with  adventure is very unusual for me (Laughs) to do. Well, the aircraft thing,  that I agreed to go and do that was kind of amazing to me because that   s  kind of scary, to catapult off one of those things and go from zero to  two-hundred miles an hour in seven seconds   I mean this is    One time  I was at an event out at the fairgrounds for the March of Dimes, I think  they were called the    Zany Olympics    and we had real nutty competition  type stuff, and a fella was changing a light bulb in the ceiling of that  Expo Square building. Well, it   s not the Expo Square building. It   s the  Pavilion where they used to have the horse shows and stuff. They don   t  anymore, but used to have. And he was changing the light bulb and then  he slid down on a rope from up there, and that was way, way up there  because that   s a vaulted ceiling. It   s very high. He walked around and I  said,    Gosh, I just don   t see how you do that. I see how you do it, but  how did you learn to do it? How   d you have the nerve to learn to do  that?    and he said,    Oh, it   s easy.    He said,    You want to try?    So first  28  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  of all, he tied me up to a rope and had me just go down from the box seat  level down to the ground, which is probably just ten feet or so, and he  said,    Well, you do that pretty good.    He said,    You want to go up there  and try?    Well I expect that fair board would have had a convoluted  heart attack if they had known this, but they didn   t know this, so I said,     Sure.    And I   m not this kind of a person, but I was. I went up there  with him and we had to get out on the roof and then come in through the  top of the building, and he hooked all this apparatus on me and he said,     Now don   t let go of this right hand. That is the most important thing,     and there was a crew there from NBC filming our event that day, and I  heard one of them holler,    If she falls, keep rolling. CBS will buy it.     (Laughter) I was working for ABC at the time, but I   that   s probably  one of the most unusual things I have ever done in my life. The aircraft  carrier was another one. On the other end of the stick, having tea at the  White House with the president   two or three presidents and their  wives   who would have ever thought I   d do this kind of thing? I   m just  a little girl from northwest Tulsa. I   m not doing it. (Laughs) So I   ve had  lots of unusual experiences, but they   ve all been fun.  Well that   s good. Now you did write two books. The first book was about  Tulsa television. Is that correct?  No, that was the second one. I think people thought it was going to be an  expos   book just because the tabloid mindset was just really coming on  strong about then. It was real funny when I had the party to announce the  book and give it away to those who were in it, they all looked at it like,     What has she said about me?    Well, it was not that kind of a book at  all. It   s a fun book about people in the Tulsa media. It   s not about me.  It   s about the people that everybody around here has known, and it was  named, If I Could Sing, I   d Be Dangerous, but that was my second  published book. The first one was, Travel Chatter in my Green Country  and Beyond. I used to do a column every week in 30 northeast  Oklahoma newspapers   not in the Tulsa because they didn   t want to  believe that anybody in television could write anything, so they didn   t  carry it here, but it was in the small weekly newspapers, all over  northeast Oklahoma. I took a bunch of those and put them as a collection  into the Travel Chatter book. My column was called    Travel Chatter.     So that was my first one, and had some of my photography in it, and  then the second one was about people in Tulsa media and    where are  they now?    type book and it was fun to do. I enjoyed that.  Any future book projects?  Well, I keep thinking of titles. I can think up the title, but then I have to  have something in the middle. (Laughs) I   ve been kind of working on  one about my mother   s family from a fictional standpoint, and then I do  29  Nykolaiszyn  Boyd  Nykolaiszyn  books for all my kids at Christmas time, but it   s just for my family. But I  did a family memory book, which I wish everybody would do. I think  genealogy is nice, to know    who begat who begat who    but it   s even  nicer if you tell your kids something about the funny things, the sad  things, the unusual things, the ordinary things that happened throughout  your life, because some of these days somebody   s gonna want to know,     Well, how did grandma get interested in       like you   re asking me now.  So I do a memory book for them, and then this last year I did a     because all my family were good cooks, I did a family cookbook, Fine  Foods from the Fairchild Gang. My mother   s maiden name was  Fairchild. And with all these sisters and all being wonderful cooks,  except for one whose favorite recipe is to open a can of Campbell   s  tomato soup, add water, stir and eat   that   s her favorite recipe  But so I  still do family type things but, oh, I   ll get around to it. I keep busy trying  to do other things and just don   t get around to it. (Laughs) But I think of  lots of titles. (Laughs)  Well we do appreciate you taking time out to speak with us for our oral  history project.  I appreciate the fact that you   re even interested in the old gal. That is  unusual to me, and I appreciate it.  Well thank you very much.  -------  -------
