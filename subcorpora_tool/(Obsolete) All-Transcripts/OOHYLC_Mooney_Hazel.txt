Did you quilt?  Yeah.  Make up your own pattern?  I had some patterns. Let   s see, Megan   s got one doesn   t she?  10  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Harmon  Mooney  We   ve all got one, Mom.

She   s my daughter  (Laughter)  She   s not crazy.  Anyway, she   s wanting to make sure that all of her great-grandchildren  have quilts also.  You   ve made a few, then.  Yeah.  Well, did you make any out of flour sacks?  No, I made dresses out of them for the girls. They were pretty and I took  lots of pains to fix them, and the sacks were pretty.  Tell them how you took me to store and you had me to pick out what I  liked, in feed sacks.  No, that wasn   t   I didn   t get them at the feed store.  Where   d we get them?  By using flour.  I know, you let me pick them out. We got to pick out   we had to have  two or more to make a dress.  I guess. I don   t know how many it used.  Was your sewing machines one of the ones with pedals?  Yeah. My sister   s daughter has it now. She has Momma   s, too. Momma  was a good hand to sew.  That   s how you learned, from her?  Well, I think it   s a gift.  I didn   t depend on her. I bought a pattern and I went by what the pattern  said.  11  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Did Grandma teach you how to read the pattern, Momma?  No, Edna. I got some ribbon to fix them a blouse, and I was in the  garden working and I come in, she done had the ribbon cut. (Laughter)  Not the right way, I   m assuming.  No.  I don   t remember that.  I had enough to fix it.  What types of things did you grow in your garden?  The same things, tomatoes and cucumbers and beans. Just a lot of things.  Did you use a pressure cooker?  Yes.  Did it ever explode on you?  No.  No green beans hit the ceiling?  Pardon?  No green beans hit the ceiling? Blow up to the ceiling?  Huh-uh.  No.  I watched it carefully.  During those early days, did the farm have water, running water?  No.  Yeah, we ran to the well and got it.  Huh?  I said it had running water. We run to the well and got it.  12  Mooney  Bishop  Mooney  Bishop  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  That   s true. (Laughter)  But did they run back? (Laughs) It   s easier running to get it than  running back, it   s a little bit more difficult.  Slowed us down. (Laughter)  That   s right.  How would you do your laundry?  With a rubboard, but later years I got a washing machine.  That was a happy day.  Yeah.  Now see Momma, I can   t even remember the rubboard.  You don   t remember? Well, it was in the outhouse when the last I knew.  The rubboard or the washing machine?  The rubboard, fixed on the ceiling or something.  We didn   t use it after I   after I was big enough we had a washing  machine, because I had to do laundry. Tell her how we did our laundry.  Tell them how we had to do our water.  Well, we had to carry it from the spring at first, and that was before I  married.  After I was born you carried it from the spring     Huh?  We had to carry it after I was born, all my life.  Yeah.  Until I married. Y   all got running water after I married. I never lived in a  house with a pot till I married.  Was it a two-seater or a one?  13  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  It was two.  Pardon?  Have one seat or two, the outhouse?  Had two.  It had two. Wasn   t it?  Who would ever go and set with another person, I don   t know.  (Laughter)  Only if you had to, I guess. What about bath time?  We did it in the tub, the washing tub.  Outside, inside?  Summertime outside, wintertime inside.  It was in the winter, had to do it in the house.  In the kitchen?  I don   t remember.  Kitchen and living room, Momma. It was all one. (Laughs)  Huh?  Kitchen and living room. It was all one for a long time until Daddy built  that room on.  The house was small?  Yeah. When I was growing up, it was a kitchen and dining room, living  room, and one bedroom, but we used the living room, had two beds in  there and two in the other room and the older ones married off.  Gave you more room.  Yeah. Grandma had a horse and buggy, but all we had was the wagon  when I was growing up.  14  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Were they from Arkansas or had they moved there from somewhere  else?  Who?  Your grandparents.  Well, Grandma, she   d lived there a long time. Sometimes my uncle  would go to the hospital and we   d go live with her. Then when he   d  come home, we   d move back to our place.  And where were you when the Depression was going on?  I was in Granny   s holler, but we grew so much stuff, we didn   t have to  stand in the line for food. We canned a lot.  How often would you get a new pair of shoes?  About once a year, in the fall, to go to school.  Momma, tell them what you did for activities.  I don   t remember.  You scared those guys   at night.  I what?  What they did at night, the cowbell?  Oh, Papa had the    then they fenced the field from the    to keep the  cows out of the things we grew to eat. Back then they   d play pranks on  each other and Papa and his friends one night, one of the men rode up on  a horse and said,    Your cows are in the field, we   ll help you get them  out.    So he went to help them and one of the men had on a cowbell and  he   d jump over in the field. Well, they   d chase him and he   d jump back  over, (laughs) and they did that until they got tired. They was awful back  then. They played pranks on each other.  They had to make their own fun.  Yeah, mm-hmm.  Would there be dances?  15  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Yeah there was dances, but my daddy went to them before, when I was  little, and Momma decided she   d go with him, to break him from going.  (Laughter) She danced with a man. Papa never did go anymore.  (Laughter)  Pretty smart woman.  Yeah, she was.  She lived to be a hundred and two.  Your mother was a hundred and two?  I think something like that.  She was a hundred and two.  Picking cotton may have helped that some I guess.  (Laughs)  Well, do you remember getting your first refrigerator?  I think the first was an icebox. I don   t remember getting the refrigerator,  but we got one, finally.  Well, electricity came to the farm probably in the    30s or    40s?  I don   t remember. When I was a kid, after I married, we had telephones  just at the neighborhood and the phone would ring and you could listen  in if you wanted to. (Laughs)  Had a party line?  Yeah. Remember one time, Grandma and my uncle, I stayed with them  one night and they took me to an ice cream social in the buggy and the  horse. I never did forget that.  Ice cream was a treat?  Pardon?  Was ice cream a treat?  Yeah.  16  Finchum  Bishop  Mooney  Bishop  Mooney  Harmon  Bishop  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Was it?  They used to have box suppers. Did you ever attend a box supper?  Yeah.  And what would you take?  A pie, I think.  We had pie suppers     Pie suppers?     auctioned them off. Momma, where did that money go?  I don   t remember.  Wasn   t it the home demonstration club?  I don   t remember.  Would you have home remedies?  Home remedies?  Uh-huh.  How do you mean?  Like if someone had a stomach ache, would you do something?  Oh yeah, that   s about all we had. Those   some remedy for something,  turpentine and aspirins and I don   t remember what all we doctored with.  Well, out in the country did anybody get snake bit?  Yeah, Momma did. She went out in the yard and a snake bit her and it  just hung on. She kicked it off and went in the house and laid down to  die and she didn   t get sick. (Laughter)  Maybe that   s why she lived to a hundred and two. Sounds like you   ve  had some fun times.  Yeah, make our own fun.  17  Finchum  Mooney  Bishop  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Bishop  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  What kind of games did you play when you were little?  Seems like   something about Ring Around the Roses. I forgot what all  they were.  Do you remember any family traditions, like at Christmas or other  holidays Or Sunday dinners, did you ever do those types of     No, we didn   t do that. It was just another day.  It was just their family, they didn   t have anybody over. And with me  growing up, Momma and Daddy was the same way.  What?  We didn   t have family over and we didn   t have very many friends ever  over.  Going back to your husband when you met him, did he take you on any  dates? How did he court you?  Going to school programs and just neighborhood things.  Did you get married in church or by the Justice of the Peace?  We went to the Church of Christ preacher. He married us.  Was anybody else there?  Just the preacher   s family.  Did he have to get permission from your father?  No, we slipped off. Momma knew that when we left. Papa wasn   t there.  And who told Papa?  Well, when we come home, Momma told him, and he was going to go  get me and Momma said,    Just leave her alone.     And how long were you married?  Well, I don   t know. Do you know Anna?  A long time.  18  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Bishop  A long time, huh?  Yeah.  You know what, I never figured that up.  Huh?  I never figured it up. Dad   s been gone thirty years. You married at  fifteen and you   re a hundred. Married at fifteen, Dad   s been gone thirty,  so sixty-five years?  Over fifty at least.  Yeah, probably sixty-two years, I think, is about right, because at your  fiftieth anniversary Daddy had already had a stroke. Remember Dad was  really not good at your fiftieth wedding anniversary. Remember your  fiftieth wedding anniversary?  Seems like I kind of do. Didn   t you and Eva come and fix dinner or  supper, didn   t you?  We had everybody over Momma. We had a big deal.  Huh?  We had a big deal. All your friends and everybody came. Remember  going in and talking to Daddy and getting Daddy up?  It   s a long time to be married to one person.  It sure is.  It is these days.  What was your secret?  Well, if you loved them, stay with them.  Even if they make you mad?  Yeah. No matter what come or went, you just stayed in there.  What do you think   what   s your secret to longevity? Is there anything  that   s contributed to your long life, do you think?  19  Mooney  Harmon  Bishop  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Bishop  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  I don   t know. I just done the best I could.  She   s a health nut. She never drank tea, coffee, any kind of caffeine,  never smoked, never drank, never ate too much.  Did you ever think you   d live to be a hundred?  No, I never, never.  And how did you celebrate when you turned one hundred?  Anna gave me a party.  Do you have a philosophy that you live by?  Live right. Treat other people like you   d want to be treated. Do good for  evil.  Momma, tell them how many animals and what all kind of animals you  always had.  I had a pet skunk and a pet squirrel.  What were their names?  Stinky.  One of them was Suzie, wasn   t it?  Uh-huh, and Stinky.  I went somewhere once and the squirrel was up in the tree and I told her,  let   s see, what was her name?  Suzie?     Suzie, come down.    And she come down on the closest limb to me,  well I couldn   t reach her. So I got a pole and put it up there and let her  come down.  And how did you end up with a skunk?  A neighbor, was it the skunk that she gave me or the squirrel?  I don   t know how you go it. Every animal that ever lived that had a  problem, we had it. We had ducks, geese, chickens, cows, goats. What  20  Finchum  Harmon  Finchum  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  other animals are there? Pigs. What other animals are there, Momma?  We had all the animals.  You didn   t mention a dog or a cat.  Oh, guineas, dogs and cats.  Guineas?  Yeah and she   d set them and hatch them. And guess who had to clean up  their mess.  I think a neighbor gave me the squirrel. I had two but there was a hole in  the floor and a rat come up and bit one of them and it died.  Must have had rabies, why would it die?  I don   t think the squirrel had babies, did it?  No. It got caught in the fan.  Huh?  Didn   t it get caught in the fan?  Oh, that was the squirrel.  The squirrel got caught in the cooling unit outside, that water cooler we  had.  And it killed it. It was the cutest thing, she wouldn   t let nobody pick her  up but me. Anna   s cousins was there once and Bobby went to pick her  up once and he decided he wouldn   t, (laughter) but I could do her  anyway.  Well, did the skunk still have its stink sack?  Yeah, I took her to have it took out. I think I went to two veterinaries,  neither one of them would do it. (Laughter)  Well, did she ever spray?  She sprayed   the cat raised the skunk. A neighbor give her to me, and I  went home and I thought,    Well, I   m going to see if she   ll take this  skunk.    And she did. And she just raised it like it was hers, and the  kittens would play with her and one day she sprayed them. They got two  21  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Bishop  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Bishop  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  rough on her. They didn   t fool with her anymore. One of them did, never  quit.  Hopefully that was outside when she sprayed.  I guess she was in the house.  We had everything in the house.  Huh?  We had everything in the house.  No, we didn   t have everything in the house. (Laughter)  Just about, didn   t we?  Well I want to know, what   s life like for you at one hundred? What   s a  day in the life of a hundred-year-old?  Well, it   s just, I   m just here.  Tell them what you do. Bob comes and gets you to go eat, three times a  day. She has a new boyfriend.  He   s real nice. He does a lot of things for me.  And how did you meet him?  Here.  They come to Wetumka.  No, Momma, your boyfriend, Bob.  Yeah. We had singings or something, or maybe it was a preacher at the  school, at the place where we were going, and he come up there and I  made him cry.  Momma, we   re talking about Bob, here.  Here. I met him here.  I know.  22  Mooney  Finchum  Bishop  Mooney  Harmon  Bishop  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Bishop  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Harmon  Finchum  Harmon  And so, he liked me the first time he seen me and I did him. And then  we   re still friends. He   s real good to me. He helps me with the little  things.  It   s nice to have someone like that, isn   t it?  And how old is he?  He   s about two and a half years younger than me.  He   ll be ninety-eight in December. Where is he now, Momma? It   s five  o   clock.  Can   t beat a good friend.  Went to supper, I guess.  Without you?  I don   t know. (Laughter) If he went, he went without me.  When history is written, what do you want it to say about you?  Well, I lived   I was a Christian from the time I was twelve years old  and I tried to treat everybody right. It pays to do right.  Do you have a favorite church song?  I guess    Amazing Grace   .  Do you know the verses?  No, not now. I   ve forgot everything nearly.  That   s one of the better ones. Anything else you want to ask her before  we just sign off?  Oh, I just wondered what things she   s seen in her lifetime, for the first  time. It   s like cars, planes, telephones, cell phones. She has a cell phone.  A cell phone?  And learned how to use it and all the computers. She   s seen all that, you  know.  23  Bishop  Mooney  Bishop  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Bishop  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooner  Bishop  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  What do you think it the greatest invention that   s been made in your  lifetime?  I guess the car.  You remember your first car or the first     I don   t think I do.  We rode the tractor to town and back. We didn   t have a car, we had a  tractor. Do you remember that, Momma? We parked it up there by the  Baptist church and then we walked to the stores. Sometimes we parked it  behind Henry Bowles.  I guess we did. I guess so. I think the mules went too.  And Hicks, Clyde Hicks we went there to sell our cream and stuff.  Do you remember seeing your first airplane?  No, they   d fly over and we   d run out to see them a flying.  Television?  Papa and Momma got one. I don   t remember our first television.  They didn   t have one when you were home, Momma. You didn   t have a  TV until you married.  No. No.  Just a radio. A radio?  Yeah.  What types of programs would you listen to on the radio?  I forgot the names. I don   t     At noon when we would come in from the field, you don   t remember  what we would listen to?  No.  Johnnie Lee Wills and the Playboys.  24  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Bishop  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Bishop  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Harmon  Yeah.  When we came in it was always at high noon and they came on and we  would came in out of the field and they would play that one song. I can   t  even remember the name of it, it was their theme song. It was Johnnie  Lee Wills and the Texas Playboys.  My brain won   t hold everything now.  Well, Momma yours is bigger, it should.  It shrunk.  Shrunk. Well, I can tell them a lot that you left out. (Laughter) Picking  cucumbers and selling them at the pickle factory.  Do you remember that?  Yeah.  She   ll remember a bunch of, because I was the one that picked them.  Where was the pickle factory?  Calvin.  In    Where was it?  Calvin.  Huh?  Calvin, Oklahoma.  And what was the man   s name that run it?  Bill Getty.  He had a daughter.  Patsy.  So you remember more than you think.  Where did we eat, Momma? That   s the only time we ever got to eat out,  remember when Daddy took the peanuts or the cotton to his   he had a  25  Mooney  Bishop  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Bishop  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Harmon  Mooney  cotton gin down there and they had a caf     the Getty   s had a caf   there,  remember? I ate my first hamburger there. Do you remember that?  Yeah.  Did you get it for free, because you gave some cucumbers for the  pickles?  I think he did   I think we did get our supper for free. I   m pretty sure.  I think we did, I think Bill Getty     Yeah, gave it to us for bringing our cotton, our peanuts, whichever we  had. Daddy took both of them to his gin and boy, I can remember Daddy  always took us. We never got to go with Daddy, but we got to go to that.  I   m sure in those days, you exchanged something you grew for food or  medical care. Did you ever do that?  How much milk you milked and sold for commodities that people traded  you, gave you commodities. They gave you peanut butter and cheese for  your milk. We were happy to get the peanut butter and cheese, because  they got all they wanted and we didn   t get all we wanted. What else did  you trade?  What?  What else did we get from you trading milk?  I   d forgot all about it. Just anything we could get.  I don   t remember anything but peanut butter and cheese. Cheese came in  that big box, that big long box. And peanut butter came in a big jar.  What else did we get from them? I don   t remember anything else, but  that.  I don   t remember anything else either.  Maybe that   s all they got we wanted. She had a milk route.  A milk route?  Ask her about her milk route.  And I delivered milk.  26  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Finchum  Mooney  Finchum  Harmon  Finchum  Mooney  Harmon  Mooney  Harmon  Finchum  Bishop  Finchum  And cream and buttermilk.
