Story_ID: 196766
Speaker 1: Now, the next couple of questions are just some People magazine-ish-type questions, so if you could give me short answers to these questions that would be great.  Would you please share with us your favorite food?
Speaker 2: My favorite food?  I grew up on the farm, and my grandmother prepared three meals a day.  She didn't worry too much about whether or not it was your favorite, but it was always good healthy food that was grown on the farm, so I'm really not sure that I have a favorite food.  I, I enjoy what I eat.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What about your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: I guess winter is my favorite time of year.
Speaker 1: Your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color, look at the carpet and look around you.
Speaker 1: So I take it, it's red (laughter)--
Speaker 2: It's red.  I said no red?  You know, your little memos, there's no red for me.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Where I haven't been already.
Speaker 1: And your favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, the world shrinks or expands in relationship to how we choose to live it.
Story_ID: 196767
Speaker 1: Let's begin talking about your mother; would you please begin with her name and where she grew up as a girl and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: My biological mother was Annie Mae Ott Jackson.  I--my guess is that she grew up in-between Jones [County] and Forrest counties in Mississippi.  I don't know very much about--well, I don't know anything about my mother, actually; she died when I was three-years-old.  So that's about it.
Speaker 1: And you were raised by your paternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Paternal grandparents, yes.
Speaker 1: Can you tell us a little bit about them, starting with their names and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: They were--are Conteen [ph.] and Frozeen McCullum Jackson [ph.].  Grandmother, I suppose, grew up in Forrest County.  Papa seems to have grown up in or somewhere around mid-state in a place that I often heard him talk about, Sugar Lake [ph.], Mississippi.  And he, in some way or fashion, managed to migrate down to the area where my grandparents and--my grandmother and, and family lived and there he met her and, and they were married.  And my, my grandmother's family were landowners, and so as each child married out, they were given so much land.  And Papa was a very industrious and aggressive person, and so in addition to what they were given, they managed to acquire quite a bit more during that time together during their journey, and consequently, we grew up on the farm.  They were farmers.  Papa was also, at some point, before my time, a contractor for the [J. J.] Newman Lumber Company of [Hattiesburg, Mississippi] Jones County, and, I guess, during that time, grandmother basically ran the farm.  But anyway, by the time I came along, they were both full-time, you know, running the farm.  And that was my primary environment, with the exception of one year that I spent in Detroit [Michigan] with my dad [Mack Jackson] and my mom when they were there.
Story_ID: 196768
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little about your father, starting with his name.
Speaker 2: Mack Jackson.  I guess he was, he was the only son.  He had, let me see, I guess five sisters.  My grandfather had been married before, so he had a daughter by, or children by his previous marriage, and he had a daughter that was born after his and grandmother's children were born, but she was always accepted in the family as were, you know, the others.  So he was kind of spoiled, I'd say, because his sisters loved him to death, and of course, his mother loved him to death, you know.  So he was a bit on the spoiled side.  But daddy was a very industrious person.  Like many people, you know, they reach a certain point in their growth and they want to leave the farm, and of course, he did too.  And during the [Great] Depression years, ran into problems, so that's how they got to Detroit [Michigan] because he had--Aunt Velma [ph.] lived in Detroit, and so she invited him to come to Detroit and find a--get himself a good paying job, and he did.  And that's how they got to Detroit for a few years and while they were there, I spent a year there with him.
Speaker 1: What about your paternal grandparents, did you know them at all?
Speaker 2: Not--well, I knew them.  I knew of them, but, I--you know, I didn't have a day-to-day relationship with them, but yes, I, I knew them.  My grandfather was--he was just very committed to coming to visit with us every so often.  My grandmother, from all I can figure out looking back, was kind of a gypsy spirit and I think maybe she may have passed a bit of that onto me.
Speaker 1: Well, what were your paternal grandparents' names?
Speaker 2: Jackson.
Speaker 1: And do you remember their first names?
Speaker 2: Frozene [ph.] and Conteen [ph.]--
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Ms. [HistoryMaker Victoria] Adams, I meant your maternal grandparents; what were their names?
Speaker 2: Oh, they were Thomas and Pinky Ott [ph.].  Grandpa was Thomas, Jr.
Story_ID: 196769
Speaker 1: How far back can you trace your ancestry?  Do you know if you all came from free people or slaves?  And, you know, your [paternal] grandparents [Conteen McCollum Jackson and Frozene McCollum Jackson (ph.)] were landowners, so do you--how far back can you trace your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Actually, I can only go back--let me, see, grandmother, grandmother--I can only go back three generations and my assumption is that they were enslaved.  I, I often wonder--well, no, I didn't offer wonder, I didn't start to wonder until fairly recently, where did the property come from in the first place, you know.  And I had one elder who was still around who could probably answer that question and I so gave her a call when it dawned on me that if I don't get it now, I won't get it.  And I asked her where did the McCullum land come from?  And she said that my great-grandfather, during the time when people could homestead, he came to that area from wherever and homestead it, a couple hundred acres of land and that's, that's where it came from.
Speaker 1: And tell us what homesteading is.
Speaker 2: Well, homesteading, as I understand it, was you could--to claim, you could stake out a claim for x amount of land, but you had to cultivate that land.  And if you, you know, had done what, what, what was considered cultivating or whatever, to meet the criteria after, after a certain period of time, you then received the title to the land.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 196770
Speaker 1: What's your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: That's very--that's pretty serious (laughter).  I am not altogether certain if this is my earliest memory or not, but the impacting was.  After my mother [Annie Mae Ott Jackson] had died, and I do remember being at the funeral, while I guess not really understanding what that was all about, but I distinctly remember looking down at my mother at the cemetery.  And I guess they tried explaining that my mother had died, but I dreamed that my grand--that I saw my mother coming across the pasture to the house and I was running to meet her, and when I awakened, I ran to my grandmother saying, "I told you my mother's not dead.  You know, my mother's not dead.  I saw her.  She was coming across the pasture."  And that's what I remember vividly.
Speaker 1: How did your mother die, did you know?
Speaker 2: She had surgery.  The--in those days, blacks were not given the most, you know, attention--adequate attention, should I say.  My mother and her youngest sister were in the hospital at the same time.  My mother had had surgery, I don't know what for, and also, her sister had surgery.  And her, her sister was younger than she was, and the sister was apparently in pain or something and nobody was responding to her so my mother got out of her bed.  They had them both in the same room.  My mother got out of her bed and tried to go to her sister and she fell and burst her stitches, and in those days, that could be fatal, and in her case, it was.  And the real tragedy was within a week, the sister was dead also.  So my maternal grandparents [Pinky Ott and Thomas Ott, Jr.] lost two children within a week of each other, the two youngest girls.
Story_ID: 196771
Speaker 1: Tell us about, you know, some other memories of growing up?  Like, what were holidays like and that kind of thing?  And just what was daily life like on the farm [in Hattiesburg, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Daily life on the farm was very, very engaged from the time you awakened until the time you went to sleep at night.  Everybody, as soon as you were able--capable of balancing yourself, you had a task, you had a job that you performed.  And the first one that I remember was carrying water.  I had a little, what you called half gallon syrup tin, and when my grandmother or whoever would go to get water, you had to bring water into the home, you know, there was no such thing as in-house.  And they had--my, my [paternal] grandparents [Conteen McCollum Jackson and Frozene McCollum Jackson (ph.)] had cedar buckets to keep their water--their drinking water in.  And so they would bring in the water in the cedar buckets and I would come with my bucket of water also.  The next task that I recall was bringing in wood because we also had--you know, our heating was--we had a fireplace and, and stove.  And so I started out by carrying a stick of stove wood, wood for the stove, and then as you grew older, you know, you were able to carry a little more and a little more and so it went.  And eventually, if you were female, you graduated to doing the dishes and making the beds and sweeping the floors and sweeping the yards and so it went.
Story_ID: 196772
Speaker 1: Were you the only child who lived on the farm [in Hattiesburg, Mississippi] with your [paternal] grandparents [Conteen McCollum Jackson and Frozene McCollum Jackson (ph.)]?
Speaker 2: I had my younger brother [Glodies Jackson] and a first cousin who was older than I that grew up in the household with my grandparents.
Speaker 1: And what kinds of things did you all do together?
Speaker 2: Work (laughter).  Work.  Oh, on Sundays, you know, you--after church--and, and, and all the kids in the neighborhood would come to our place because we had a big pasture and they could play baseball, you know.  And, and, and on--for Easter, my grandparents would do--would hide everybody--the eggs for everybody.  Our place was kind of a gathering place.  We also had a phonograph, some people called it a Victrola, where you could have some music, you know.  And that was a Sunday thing.  Many people in the community--Saturday was you went to town on Saturday.  You know, you worked Monday to Friday, and Saturday, you went to town.  But as a female child, you didn't have as much freedom as did the male fe--fellas in the family.  And so they went to town, I swept yards.  I, I always read.  I don't remember when I couldn't read.  I'd find me a good book after I had done, you know, my yards and everything and read and read.  I'll give you--I said work, I'll give you an example.  One day--ev--every time you get an extra minute, you know, that, that wasn't already called for, we'd shoot models.  We loved to shoot models.  And my brother and I was shooting models.  We had stolen us a few minutes there, we thought, and Papa was sitting on the porch.  And my grandfather always sat with his legs crossed and his hands cupped like this.  And my brother said--my brother kind of stutter, he still does, "Look, look, look, look at that old man, Victoria sitting up there thinking up something for us to do."  (Laughter). Papa's, papa's motto was idle minds are the devil's workshop, and, and he kept both your mind and your hands engaged.
Speaker 1: What were holidays like Christmas and Thanksgiving like on the farm?
Speaker 2: Very, very, very great times, beautiful times.  They were family times.  In addition to your fruit, your several pieces of fruit and whatever other trinket you may have when you wake up Christmas morning, then you went through the neighborhood and you knocked on doors and you said, "Good morning, Christmas gift."  And, of course, wherever you went, the--household always brought something and gave you something.  So it was a great time, it was very enjoyable.  Very enjoyable.
Story_ID: 196773
Speaker 1: Could you please give us your siblings' names and birth order, including yourself?
Speaker 2: I'm the oldest of three.  My father [Mack Jackson], they had my brother, is a twin.
Speaker 1: And his name?
Speaker 2: Glodies.  G-L-O-D-I-E-S.  Never met another one.  Glodies Jackson.  And--but the, the--his twin died in infancy, so we never really knew that child at all.  In his later years, my father had another family.  They--his--you know, our family was never severed or anything, but he just raised another family of children.  And of course, in later years, I came to the realization that those young people didn't--were not responsible for anything, so I decided that it was important to reach out to them, and so I've attempted to do that.  And I've met most of them, not all of them, but I've met most of them.
Speaker 1: When you were younger, did you kind of resent the fact that, you know, they had the, the father and--
Speaker 2: No, I didn't resent it, I just thought daddy--you know, I, I--all my values were the values of, of the family and the community, and I just thought dad was wrong.  He shouldn't be raising another family, but I didn't attempt to--I didn't allow it to interfere with my care and my respect for him.  Later, as I got to know some of the young people, I found it very interesting because I asked--one of the questions I remember asking the older one when I first met her was, "What do you remember about,"--my father was dead by this time--"What do you remember about daddy?"  And she, you know, started to tell me what she remembered about daddy in the same way as though--and she said what--and I said, "Well, what, what bothered you most?"  She said, "Well, the thing that really bothered me most was the fact that we--daddy would be with us in the daytime, but he would never be with us at night.  We--he may be there when we go to bed, but when we wake up, he would be gone."  And my parent adopted twin girls also in the late years, and she said, "I resented the fact that the twins--he would stay with the twins at night and he never spent nights with us."  But, but then she didn't understand, you know, all--what all that was about, at that time.
Speaker 1: So the twins, they lived someplace else?
Speaker 2: The twins lived with mom and dad, see?  And so these children--this particular child said she resented the fact that the twins--you know, that daddy stayed with the twins, but he never stayed with them.
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 196774
Speaker 1: Can you kind of describe your community [Palmers Crossing, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] for us a little bit?
Speaker 2: My community was an African American community.  Most of the people in that community when I was growing up were--owned their property; most, not all, but most.  They all had, you know, did some farming to whatever degree was necessary.  Ours was a very proud community.  The--everything in the community was black controlled and that, and that was very intentional, that was not an accident, okay?  And--
Speaker 1: Was there like a bank in the community and--
Speaker 2: There was not a bank in the community, there--but there were grocery stores that were more like, I guess, hardware stores was--would, would be the nearest thing because they had everything.  They had--it was a grocery store, but it, it had everything, most everything that people needed on a day-to-day basis, okay?  And, and I like to tell this one.  The school system was established in 1890.  I was the keynote speaker at my first school reunion there, and in doing my research I found out, you know, that the school in fact was established in 1890, and so one of the things that I said in my, in my keynote speech was, "While Mississippi was calling a constitutional convention in 1890 to try to take us back, the citizens of Palmers Crossing [Hattiesburg, Mississippi] was saying, 'Thanks, but no thanks.'"  They were organizing a school and they did.  And that school system, of course, is still there.  It eventually became the only high school in Forrest County [Mississippi].  There were--there was a high school in the City of Hattiesburg [Mississippi], but there were any number of communities within Forrest County, large communities, but the only high school for blacks was Palmers Crossing.  And so sooner or later, if you went to high school, you had to come to Palmers.  And in other areas, other counties where they did not have black high schools, the young people who wanted to go to high school, their parent would bring them into Forrest County.  They would live in with people in the county and go to--attend school at DePriest [Consolidated School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 196775
Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells remind you of growing up?
Speaker 2: Food cooking.  The natural environment after a rain.  I always liked the smells that came after the rain.  Hearing a train running in the night blowing with the whistle, which you probably don't understand, blowing.  And sometimes here in Petersburg [Virginia], at about--between three and five o'clock in the morning, you can hear that train passing through, blowing its whistle and that reminds me of growing up.
Speaker 1: And, and the smells, you said the smells of different foods cooking.
Speaker 2: And, and, and the earth after the rain, yeah, very definitely.
Speaker 1: What other memories do you have of growing up on the farm?
Speaker 2: Busy (laughter)--I'm sorry, busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.  Oh, I loved, I loved Sundays, you know, when we--after Sunday school and church.  And as I said, our place was kind of a gathering place for not only young people, but not so young people, for whatever reason.  I enjoyed school.  I enjoyed school very much.  And we always--during--at the end of the school year, we always had programs.  And usually after you reach a certain grade level, you would--each class would have the opportunity of, of doing a play.  And you had a night--your, your class had a night to do their play, and of course, all the community came out to see the plays.
Story_ID: 196776
Speaker 1: Baccalaureate sermon [at DePriest Consolidated School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] was always a big event.  In fact, I had my first--my very first vision of a very specific something that I intended to do as a result of attending a baccalaureate sermon.  I was--this was preschool, I'm quite sure of that, and I remember at the baccalaureate sermon when the graduating--you know what that is?  Do you know what a baccalaureate service is?
Speaker 2: I'm assuming it's a graduation service.
Speaker 1: It's the graduation worship.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay?  And it's apart from the graduation--the actual graduation event, and it's usually the last Sunday before school closes.  And I remember seeing the graduates coming down the hall with their robes and their caps with the tassels on them and I was very impressed, you know, to the music, you know.  And after we were home that Sunday evening--we had fireplaces, that was the primary heating facility in our home, and on the side from that fireplace there was a huge box where you put--you kept your wood, so you always had wood for the fireplace.  And I remember sitting on the edge of that wood box, and there were a lot of people in the room, and I was back visiting that, that march down to the stage, you know.  And I could see myself wear--wearing me a cap and gown, and I made a decision sitting on that wood box that Sunday afternoon that I was going to wear that cap and gown, I really was.  And so I, I was totally oblivious to the people who were in the room until somebody said something to me, you know, it kind of jarred me out of, of that daydream.  And there was a long jump in those days between the beginning of school and graduating high school, and there were many temptations to get in the way that could prevent that.  But anytime I was halfway tempted to get into anything or take any path that might prevent that, I would remember that, that daydream and it would bring me right back into line.
Story_ID: 196777
Speaker 1: What was the name of the elementary school you attended?
Speaker 2: It was --in the beginning, it was Forrest County Training School [Hattiesburg, Mississippi] and then it became DePriest Consolidated School [Hattiesburg, Mississippi], but it was the same system all the time.
Speaker 1: Do you remember some of your teachers during elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Yes, I remember teachers there, but the one that everybody remembered was Mrs. Jones, Areola Jones [ph.].  She was our fourth grade teacher, fourth--she taught fourth and fifth grades, and you did not leave Mrs.--Miss Jones' classroom until you had gotten what she had to offer.  She didn't, she didn't accept the fact that you couldn't learn, you know.
Speaker 1: What type of student were you in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Oh, I was always very good, after I passed--got out of the primer.  Now, you don't know what the primer is, but the primer would be equivalent to kindergarten now.  That year I could not stand school.  I don't know what the problem was, but as long as when you came to school you had--you know, you played around until the bell rang, then when the bell rang, you had to go inside.  And I would be enjoying myself to the highest until it was time to go inside, and when it was time to go inside, my teeth would start hurting and I would cry and cry until they would take me home.  And so I didn't pass from the primer, because I never stayed in school 'cause I had to go as soon as the bell rang to go out.  I think I might have been afraid of the teacher, I don't know what it was, but whatever it was, it held me back.  Anyway, the next year when I went back to school, all the kids that had been in the primer with me, they had gone on and here I was back in the primer again, so then I was upset about that, so I started doing my lessons.
Story_ID: 196778
Speaker 1: So we were talking about elementary school [Forrest County Training School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], and you wanted to share a story with us.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about being in primer.  This summer, my hometown decided to celebrate my work in human and civil rights, and so they began--oh, I don't--well, I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, but it began with breakfast.  And so when I came into the facil--the restaurant, there was the mayor and another fellow standing with him and so he reached out and hugged me and said, "[HistoryMaker] Victoria [Adams], I know you.  I know you don't know me, but I know you."  I said, "Oh, yeah?  And who are you?"  He said, "We were classmates."  I said, "When?"  He said, "In the primer."  And I said, "In the primer?  I don't even remember the primer," (laughter).  Forgetting about who my classmates were; I, I thought it was so funny, you know.  He said, he said we were classmates, you know, I figured we had been classmates, you know, at least in high school [DePriest Consolidated School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] or something like that; he said in the primer (laughter). And that was so funny.
Story_ID: 196779
Speaker 1: When you were in elementary school [Forrest County Training School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], did you have dreams and aspirations?
Speaker 2: I always had dreams and aspirations.  As I said, I remember the first one sitting on the wood, wood box after that baccalaureate service, but I don't, I don't know a time when I didn't have dreams and aspirations.
Speaker 1: What were they?
Speaker 2: Well, basically, I--that, that first one stayed with me.  I knew I was going to finish high school [DePriest Consolidated School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi] and wear the cap and gown.  But from time to time, as you do when you're growing up, you know, you--of course, you want to be this and then later, you want to be that and so forth.  I always knew that I was gonna travel, there was never a question about that, I was going to travel.  I figured I was gonna teach.  I always--you know how when kids play, I was always the teacher (laughter), so I knew very well that I was most likely going to teach.  And I did for a while, but--and I really, really enjoyed teaching, I still do, but I couldn't stand the regimentation, that's why I say I think my, my maternal grandmother [Pinky Ott (ph.)] passed some of that gypsy spirit onto me.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: I have to have a lot of freedom.
Speaker 1: Um-hm--
Story_ID: 196780
Speaker 1: During the elementary school years, what type of child were you?  You told us a little bit about what type of student you were, but what type of child were you?
Speaker 2: Independent.  My grandmother [Conteen McCollum Jackson (ph.)] said I talked too much basically, because I always had opinions, and in my growing up years, children were supposed to be seen and not heard, and I kind of missed the boat on that one.  I always wanted to be heard, and it, of course, gets you in a lot of trouble, but nevertheless.  But I was very respectful.  I--it never ever occurred to me not to be respectful of all, of all the people.  I, oftentimes, found myself not the most popular person around.  As I told you earlier, I was an avid reader.  I read all the time.  I read everything and my grandmother had books and books and all kinds of books and so I read them.  And so I had--you know, I had book information about--just about everything under the sun that came my way.  And oftentimes, especially in class when questions and discussions would be taking place, and I always had some response, you know, to these things.  And sometimes your classmates resented that, you know.  They--
Speaker 1: Did, did they sometimes think, oh, you know, she's a know-it-all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's exactly what happened, you know, and so what are you supposed to do?  Are you supposed to not say what you have to say and not share what you have to share or what do you do?  And of course, as I said, you know, if I had an opinion, I usually wanted to share it or speak it, however it was perceived.  I got along much better with males than I did females and I imagine that was primarily because I grew up in a home with males, you know.  I had a first cousin who lived with her parents nearby, but my--most exposure was males.  I had lots of male cousins and all that sort of thing.  So that was probably one of the things that was a little bit different.  I did have some, you know, female friends that we got along okay, but never very many.
Speaker 1: Um-hm--
Story_ID: 196781
Speaker 1: What were you family's experiences like at church and what was the name of the church you all attended?
Speaker 2: Grew up in St. John Methodist Episcopal Church, which eventually became St. John Methodist Church, which eventually became St. John United Methodist Church [Hattiesburg, Mississippi].  My church family was simply an extension of my, you know, biological family.  I, I was--even when I go home now, I'm, I'm--as much and as comfortable in that congregation there at the church as I am with the family there at home, you know.  My entire family was very much involved in the life of the church.  My grandmother [Conteen McCollum Jackson (ph.)] was president of the--at that time, I believe it was called the Ladies' Aid Society.  Papa [Frozene McCollum Jackson (ph.)] was a trustee.  In fact, my grandfather's name is on the cornerstone of St. Johns Church from the way back there where we were talking about.  So I was always in church.  I was always in church.  I was always in church, Sunday school.  As I grew older, I can't remember the name of the youth group now, but that and tried to sing in the choir and everybody made fun of me, so I dropped out on that and I never went back.  But other than that, other than not singing in the choir, I did everything.  I was a Sunday school superintendent when I was probably sixteen or seventeen years-old.  And my church offers lots and lots of opportunities for growth and exposure, you know.  I don't know if you know anything about the Methodist church, but at one time, it was segregated, of course, and there were four districts.  The church was composed of, of four geographical districts and the fifth one was called the central jurisdiction and that was blacks; that was for us.  Anyway, we had a beautiful retreat center [Gulfside Assembly, Waveland, Mississippi] on the Gulf of Mexico down beyond Gulfport [Mississippi], and lots of names that you might recognize and young people would come there from all over the state and beyond the conference and the jurisdiction.  And so it offered lots and lots of opportunities for meeting other people from other places, other young people from other places learning, you know, from each other.  And, I guess, that, too, had just a little bit probably to do with the fact that I was always not too popular because I always had something to say that most of my peers did not--were not familiar with but it, it contributed much to my own growth.
Speaker 1: And do you think you were just kind of wise beyond your years?
Speaker 2: Probably, because--
Speaker 1: And it was just--
Speaker 2: --of the exposures that I, that I was blessed with.
Speaker 1: Um-hm--
Story_ID: 196782
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about your experiences in high school [DePriest Consolidated School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi]; the high school level, what were your experiences like during high school?
Speaker 2: Like everything else, I was always very busy, involved in whatever was going on.  If what we needed wasn't going on, I tried to help it to get going on (laughter), and I remember once the principal said anytime anything happened that kind of involved a group becoming rebellious or whatever, whatever, he always came looking for me 'cause he, he figured (laughter) out the fellow that started it.  But no, I was very, very actively involved in whatever was going on.  I was always willing to try new things.  I was always willing, if what you needed wasn't there, to find out why it wasn't there and see if we couldn't make sure it was there.  And so that's just kind of been my nature, you know, all that.  I, I was class--what was I?  Let's see, Melvin [ph.] was the valedictorian; Bessie [ph.] was the salutatorian; I was--do you have a class prophet?  I think we did; that's what I was.
Speaker 1: The class prophet, huh?
Speaker 2: This is graduating class (laughter).
Speaker 1: Who were some of your teachers in high school?
Speaker 2: There was Mrs. S.J. Neil [ph.]; there was Mrs. Mattie Woods Jennings; there was Mr.--I can't remember Mr. Johnson's [ph.] first name; there was Mrs.--I can see her, but I can't remember her name, but I guess my favorite teacher, but also, the one that I backed off on was the English teacher, Mattie Woods Jennings.  She was very demanding and I always thought she picked on me, but of course, as I grew older, I realized she wasn't picking on me, she was just insisting on me doing what she knew I was capable of doing, and I would only do as much as I thought I needed to or wanted to do.  You know, I began not--I, I, I became less concerned about having the best grades and all that sort of thing, because so many times I would know that I had the best grades and all of that, but, if you ever heard of teacher's pets, I ran into a lot of that, but I was never one of 'em (laughter).  I may have been Mrs. Jennings', but she never let me know it until much later.
Story_ID: 196783
Speaker 1: During high school [DePriest Consolidated School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], what were your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Oh, I intended to go.  It never occurred to me that I wasn't going, yeah.  My [paternal] grandmother was a teacher, by the way, so--
Speaker 1: And did she give up teaching to work on the farm?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, yeah, when she went to--you know, she gave up--well, no, she didn't give up teaching to work on the farm, she gave up all the stuff when she got married because, I mean, I guess that was a part of, of the deal, you know.  But, yeah, I was always going to college.
Speaker 1: Where did you think you wanted to go?
Speaker 2: I didn't know where I wanted to go, I just knew I was going, but of course, as we moved in that direction or--there were three of us decided we were going to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] we weren't gonna go to school in the South, we were gonna go to the school in the North, so we decided to go to Wilberforce University, and we did.
Speaker 1: And let me ask you this, Ms. [HistoryMaker Victoria] Adams, during high school, who was influencing you?  Who were you being most influenced by?
Speaker 2: Mrs. [Mattie Wood] Jennings, certainly, was quite an influence; Mrs. [S. J.] Neil [ph.] was quite an influence; and I guess, Mr. Travilian [ph.], the prin--the school principal, in, in spite of the fact that he always accused me of everything, he influenced my, my, you know, I think, direction quite much.
Speaker 1: And what were you thinking you wanted to do?  What were, what were you thinking you wanted to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: Oh, by this time, I was gonna be a lawyer, and I was going to be an orator.  I don't know where I was gonna orate about (laughter).  If you're asking me, I'm telling you.  But, I guess underneath it all--actually, I did, I did, I did have in my mind that I would--that I was gonna be a lawyer, but by the time I got to school, I don't know, I completely forgot about that; it was just so great to be there, but of course, what I did was what most women did in those days, I taught.
Story_ID: 196784
Speaker 1: So what year did you graduate from high school [DePriest Consolidated School, Hattiesburg, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Forty-five [1945].
Speaker 1: Um-hm. And so you left to go to Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] in 1945, as well.  And what were your experiences like at Wilberforce?
Speaker 2: Pretty much what they were everywhere else.  I got in, got in really trouble with the fellows before I got there, you know, they--
Speaker 1: How did that happen? (Laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, the fellas there had sim--they had--they, they had different ideas of, you know, male/female, et cetera, et cetera, especially those guys who were the football heroes and all that kind of stuff.  See, we didn't have no football heroes where I come from, you know.  So anyway, this young man sent word by a young lady to tell me he, he needed me to iron his shirt and I said, "You need me to do what?"  I tell him, "I don't, I don't iron my brother's shirts.  I hardly don't iron his, he better iron his own shirt." (Laughter).  And they just thought that was awful.  You know, you--that's his, you know, that's--you--I said, "Honey, I don't care who he is."
Speaker 1: They thought that should be a privilege, huh?
Speaker 2: I ain't ironing nobody's shirt, period.  So I, I kind of got off on the wrong foot with the fellas.  But also, you know, and they start all that stuff coming, the entry stuff that they do, you know.  You're supposed to do whatever an upperclassman wants you to do and all that kind of stuff.  And I didn't mind going along with them as long as what they wanted me to do was reasonable, but when they come talking about getting down on your knees and barking like a dog I said, "Forget it.  I ain't barking--getting on my knees barking like a dog.  I'm not doing any of that."
Speaker 1: So were you kind of like a rebel?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Absolutely. Without apology
Story_ID: 196785
Speaker 1: And so you ended up having to leave Wilberforce [University, Wilberforce, Ohio] early?
Speaker 2: After, yeah.
Speaker 1: What happened?
Speaker 2: Well, my parent was simply not able to send me back, and so it was at that point that I had to make a decision, you know, what I was gonna do.
Speaker 1: So this was in 1946?
Speaker 2: This was--yeah, 1946, at the--so I thought about it.  I gave it a lot of thought.  There was this black grocery store owner in the community, and he was supposedly looking for somebody to help him in the store, so I went over to help him in the store.  And he made the same mistake that boy made at Wilberforce.  He wanted me to help him in the store and then he come out there wanting me to iron some shirts and I told him, "I'm not ironing nobody's shirts."  He said, "Well, if you gonna work--" I said, "I'm not ironing your shirt," and so I went home.  So I knew I wasn't gonna do that, and I knew I wasn't gonna cook for anybody 'cause I didn't know how to cook anyway; I didn't want to know how.  And so I got thinking, "Well, what am I gonna do?"  You know, so I said, "Going to see Mr. Travilian [ph.]."  So I went to see Mr. Travian [sic.].
Speaker 1: Mr. who?
Speaker 2: Mr. Travilian, my high school principal.  And I said, "Mr. Travilian, do you think I could teach school?"  He said, "Jackson [HistoryMaker Victoria Adams], you can do anything you want to do, you always have."  I said, "Well, I think I--that's what I want to do."  He said, "Sure you can teach school."  He said, "But you don't want to try to teach in, in your home area because, you know, it won't work very well.  But I will, I will give you some referrals, and I think you would make a very good teacher."
Story_ID: 196786
Speaker 1: --Where did you go teach?
Speaker 2: To the school where I got that apple over there today--I mean, that I showed you earlier today, Benson High School [ph.], and--
Speaker 1: And where was Benson?
Speaker 2: In Jones County [Mississippi].  It was an adjoining county to Forrest County [Mississippi], which is a very big county, and in the community called Moselle [Jones County, Mississippi], and that's--that began my teaching career.  And I taught at Benson, and I taught during the summer.  My friend, who also taught at Benson, was supposed to do a summer job in Wayne County [Mississippi] with the ag [agriculture] person, and her mother became ill and she couldn't go, so she called and asked me if I would go and work with the guy, you know.  And so I went to Wayne County to work in Marie's [ph.] place and while I was there, I met Tony West Gray, Sr., so before the summer was over, we had gotten married.
Speaker 1: Wow. How long was your courtship?
Speaker 2: Quite short, to be exact.  He was very persistent.  And so I had--
Speaker 1: So this was 1947?
Speaker 2: Seven, right.  Exactly.  So I had--I was--had promised to--I had taken a job in Richton [Mississippi], that's--I can't remember the county Richton is in [Perry County, Mississippi], but anyway, I had taken the job over there, so we got married and then he took me to my school.  And that went along very well for a little while, but the principal, I didn't like the way she worked.  She wouldn't--if she had some--if she was--if there was something that she needed--that she was not happy with that you were doing, instead of telling you, she'd sent you a note, you know.  And so she sent me a note once, and then when I went to see about that, she told me I had misunderstood it, what she had said.  I said, "Well don't send me any more notes.  When I do something that you feel, you know, I need correcting or whatever, just tell me and that way we won't misunderstand."  Not too long after that she sent me another note, and I said, "Well, so much for this one."  I called my husband and told him to come get me and so I left.
Speaker 1: So you sent her a note, huh?
Speaker 2: I didn't either (laughter).  I just went and told her I was leaving and I did.
Story_ID: 196787
Speaker 1: And so what did you do after that?
Speaker 2: Well, I started teaching in--gosh, what's the name of the place?  Collins, Mississippi, and didn't get along with the principal up there either.  Well, actually what happened was I got along with him okay, but he was real nosy about everything and he--we lived in a teachers' home and one of the--
Speaker 1: What's a teachers' home?
Speaker 2: The, the--it was a home on the grounds near the--you know, in the community, that the community furnished for particularly, unmarried people who were, you know--
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: --who were not with their husbands, you had--you lived in the teacher's home.  And that was very helpful, you see, because then your, your pay was not all that great, so you didn't have to worry about rent, you didn't have to worry about utilities, that was all there; I guess that was a part of the package, so to speak.  Anyway, I had a birthday and this was, this was really, the home county of my maternal family, you know, and so I had first cousins and all that kind of stuff there in that place.  And so I had a birthday, and all my cousins--again, I had a lot of male cousins, you know; I didn't have a lot of female cousins, you know.  But anyway, they all came over to celebrate my birthday that night and oh, we had a ball.  And this young lady, who was also a teacher in the, in the home there, she told--she was--her job was to report to the principal, you know, whatever went on down there.  So she told him about this party that I had and all these men was there at my party, and so the next day he called me into his office and told me that he was going to report to my husband [Tony West Gray, Sr.] that I had had a party and I had all these men, you know, in my room at my party.  And I said, "Well, you have my permission.  You could do that.  It just so happens that my husband know all the men that were in my room, those were my first cousins, you know, but it's okay, you can tell him, okay?"  So my husband--I called my husband and told him what had happened.  He probably wanted me to go home anyway, so he came and got me (laughter) and I left there.  I was a great at leaving.  I told you I didn't need a--teaching was--I loved to teach, but the structure, I couldn't deal with.  I was always getting in trouble with it, but finally, I started teaching in Wayne County [Mississippi].
Speaker 1: Where you--and that's where your husband was living?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you all were living together as a married couple?
Speaker 2: That's where we lived, yeah.  Yeah.  So I started teaching there and did very well for a couple of years.  And then one day, I think it--we had just come back from Christmas vacation and my husband did something that--I don't even know what it was, that upset me very much, and so that evening when I left the classroom, I never went back.  I went home, packed my bags and left the city.
Speaker 1: Just left?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Where did you go?
Speaker 2: Ohio.
Speaker 1: And did--you had children at the time--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --right?  No children?
Speaker 2: No, I, I had no children.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: I went to--I went to stay with my aunt in Ohio until he found out where I was and talked me into coming back, and so, you know, that--but I never went back in the classroom until much later.
Speaker 1: And so when--
Speaker 2: And then he was called back into the Korean [War]--when the Korean conflict broke out, he was called back into the [U.S.] military and thus began our world travels.
Story_ID: 196788
Speaker 1: And where did you all travel to?
Speaker 2: Oh, we lived, you know, in many places in the country, and then we went to Germany and we spent--this was in the early '50s [1950s].  In fact, I, I was among the first dependents to accompany their husbands in Germany.  It was still--the--Germany was still under occupation when we went there in the early '50s [1950s].  We spent, I believe, four years in Germany and that's where I first became a parent.  We adopted what was called our little brown baby, at that time, except she was a five-year-old brown baby.  And I--I'm quite certain she was also my husband's daughter, but he never admitted it to me, but we all knew she was (laughter).  Anyway, we adopted her.  He found her.  See, he went to Germany ahead of me and apparently--and he had been in Germany, and he apparently made a--you know, made it his business to find her and I don't blame him, he should have.  Anyway, we adopted her and we--you know, here I was been wanting me a baby all these years, nothing, nothing, nothing.  Adopted this baby and (laughter) within no time at all, I conceived.  And so we became parent easily within a year of two, except one was, by the time Tony [West Gray, Jr.] came, Georgie [Roswitha Gray] was six-years-old, except they was six years apart (laughter).
Speaker 1: And when did you all move back to the [United] States?
Speaker 2: We came back to the States in the early--no, mid-'50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Mid-'50s [1950s].  And so what did you do when you got back to the States?
Speaker 2: That's when I had to decide now where--what am I really going to do?  Because one of the things that we, we--at that time, they did not have housing for black noncommissioned officers on the military reservation, okay?  So we had to live somewhere in the civilian community.  He was stationed at Fort Meade [Maryland].
Speaker 1: In Maryland?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  And that area was not very friendly to blacks, so we ended up--
Speaker 1: 'Cause in the '50s [1950s], it was probably a rural area wasn't it?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We living--we ended up living in [Washington] D.C.  That was the closest place, you know, that we could find a house--a--community friendly housing was in D.C., but it soon became clear that his salary was not gonna be able to, you know, take care of us living in the city like that, so that meant I had to go to work.
Story_ID: 196789
Speaker 1: So then I had to decide, so what are you gonna do?  And I said, "Well, you know, I know what I'm not gonna do, I'm not gonna do anything that I got to go from eight to five [o'clock].  I've got two kids, and I'm going to be available to my children when they need me because by now, I had been accustomed to that and I wasn't about to change that routine.  So I started hitting the want ads, you know, every day, and finally I came across this little want ad in there for this--these people looking for someone, you know, who had a lot of initiative, who wanted to work for themselves.  So I said, hey, this looks like a place I'm looking for.  So anyway, I made a call, got an appointment, went down, I was interviewed, loved it, and so that's how I entered the business world.
Speaker 2: And, and it was beauty products?
Speaker 1: Beauty Queen, Beauty Queen, which was a--you know, did beauty products and household miscellaneous.  And we had our own factory, you know, and they were just beginning, you know, like being kind of on the ground floor and--
Speaker 2: And did very well?
Speaker 1: Did very well.
Speaker 2: And you moved the business back to Mississippi?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  I decided that--my husband [Tony West Gray, Sr.] and I weren't doing too well, and I thought, I think that sooner or later, this is going to break.  And I wanted to be where I had a support system, so I decided to go back to Mississippi.  So I went to the organizer, he called himself the organizer, as opposed to the president of the company and I said, "How would you like to have a branch office in Mississippi?"  And he said, he said, "A branch office in Mississippi?"  And I said, "Yes.  I'm going to Mississippi, and I would like very much to build a branch office there."
Speaker 2: And you were quite successful there?
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.
Story_ID: 196790
Speaker 1: So, Ms. [HistoryMaker Victoria] Adams, you go back to Mississippi and, and you are a successful businesswoman there, and this is the beginning of the Civil Rights Movement?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.  The, the young--the Civil Rights Movement, of course, was something that we were reading about and seeing certain things going on here and there was the business of the James Meredith, you know, integrating Ole Miss [University of Mississippi, Oxford, Mississippi] and all of that.  Actually, we're, we're in the early '60s [1960s] now, when the first civil rights workers came to my town.
Speaker 1: To Hattiesburg [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.  And two young men, who I give full responsibility for getting me into the civil rights community (laughter)--
Speaker 1: And who were they?
Speaker 2: Hollis Watkins and Curtis Hayes; later, Curtis became Curtis Muhammad.  And they came--well, they, they were invite--in--the president of the local chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] requested, or whoever the request would go to, to send some workers to Hattiesburg, and so they sent two homegrown, the young men.  By homegrown, I mean Mississippians who had become a part of Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC] from the southwest, and so they sent Curtis and Hollis into Hattiesburg.  Well, between the time that they were requested and the time that they arrived, somebody decided they didn't want any of those troublemakers in Hattiesburg, okay?  So the word had gone out from the dean of the clergy, you know every community has a dean of clergy, you know, and it tells all the rest of the clergy what to do, and all too frequently is controlled by the power structure.  So the word went out that nobody was to open their church to these youngsters, and, of course, the church was the only place you had that you could control, in terms of having public gatherings.  And so here they were in Hattiesburg and they were being told that there was no place for them to meet, so that was supposed to mean was, you know, go on back where you came from.  So they were in my brother's [Glodies Jackson] place talking about this, and so my brother suggested that they come and see his sister, that she might be able, you know, to, to help here.  So they, so they came and told me what the situation was and I said, "Well, no."  They said, "Well, they say he--you know, he controls everything."  I said, "No, he doesn't control everything.  He doesn't control St. John's [St. John Methodist Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi], I can assure you of that."  So I called my pastor [Reverend L. P. Ponder], and he came over and met them, met with the--called a few members of the board, "Sure."  So the summer when I was being celebrated, my work was being celebrated, there was a beautiful memorial place at St. John, the birth of the Civil Rights Movement of the Forrest County, Hattiesburg, you know, area.
Story_ID: 196791
Speaker 1: Did your pastor [Reverend L. P. Ponder] suffer any repercussions for opening the doors of St. John's [St. John Methodist Church, Hattiesburg, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No visible repercussions, per se, but he certainly was not celebrated, you know.  In fact, it's interesting that you ask that, this was quite a while into the, you know, movement work in, in my--in Hattiesburg [Mississippi].  The local--what are those guys called?  Gosh.
Speaker 1: You're not talking about the Ku Klux Klan [KKK], are you?
Speaker 2: No, no, no.  This is, this is an official, this is a, you know, elected official.  I can't re--you know what they're called right now.  But anyway, they ride up and down like sheriff deputies and stuff like that, except there in the county they're not sheriff, you know, they're not sheriff, they're called something else and it'll probably come to me after a while.  See, one of the things that goes with the gift of longevity is the need for flexibility and adjustment, okay?  One minute it's there and next minute it's gone.  But anyway, justice--no, not justice of the peace, that ain't it either.  But anyway, this guy called Reverend Ponder and asked him if he could come and see him, this is probably four, five years down the line from the beginning.  And Reverend Ponder says, "Sure.  Of course you can."  And so he came.  And he came in and Reverend Ponder say, he says, "Reverend Ponder, I have come to ask your forgiveness for something that I did way, way back."  He said, "I acted, you know--."  Reverend Ponder said, "Well, whatever it was, you're already forgiven, you know."  He said, "No."  He said, "Actually, I sat on your church grounds one night and I literally had to--I, I was, I was supposed to kill you that night."  He said, "But the window was up."  You know, we didn't have air conditioning in those days.  He said, "And I started to listen to what you were saying."  He said, "And I could not pull that trigger."  He said, "And it--I have--."  He said, "It has bothered me all these years, what I almost did, and when I--and I didn't know what I was doing, and, and that's why I'm here."  And he said--and he literally got down on his knees and said, "I have to do this. I have to ask your forgiveness."
Speaker 1: Um-hm--
Story_ID: 196792
Speaker 1: Let's talk about 1962, as the field secretary of SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee].  You helped to lead a boycott against some Hattiesburg [Mississippi] businesses; why did you do that and what were the repercussions of doing that?
Speaker 2: Well see, everything we did was around vote--the, the right to vote, that--that's what it was all about.  And the, the reg--vote of regis--registrar simply would not register us to vote for all practice purposes, okay?  Us, being black folks, okay?  And we had, we had gone and gone and gone and gone, and he just simply didn't register us, that was it.  Eventually, the just--we got enough evidence against him for the Justice Department [U.S. Department of Justice] to bring him into court, you know, to bring a suit against him.  And I never--I, I was never registered in the, in the fashion, you know, becau--because I passed by him, I was registered by order, court order.  He never--he, he positively refused to register to me--to register me.  So not being able to get any kind of cooperation, you know, in terms of the business community.  And, in fact, the things that they would do to, to some of the people who tried to register to vote, see, they, they, they would publish the names of the people who tried to register to vote, and then if the employers found the names of their employees on the list of people trying to register to vote, they would fire them.  They would lose their jobs, or you know, other--whatever, whatever they could do to, to discourage people from trying to register to vote.  So we just finally came to the conclusion that, "Hey, maybe we need to take our business elsewhere.  Maybe we don't need to, to do this."  But we were not working alone, this was a, this was a statewide effort.  See, in Mississippi, we had something that was unique, in terms of movement.  In most places, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] worked over here, and SNCC worked over there, and NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], you know, they claimed turf, if you will.  They had turf, but in Mississippi, we got--we couldn't afford that luxury.
Speaker 1: Everybody worked together.
Speaker 2: So we--the, the--organized what was known as COFO, the Council of Federated Organizations and all these sources were proved and everybody worked together, you know.
Speaker 1: What happened with the boycott?  Did--was it successful?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  Yes.  Yes, indeed.  Quite, quite successful.  Business people started saying, "Hey, you know, we, we need to do something about this."  There were some people, you know, some little statements of people who decided to throw in some sit-ins for public accommodations, you know, eating at the counters and all that kind of stuff, but that was really never the real issue in Mississippi.
Speaker 1: The real issue was voting, right?
Speaker 2: The real issue was voting.  The right to vote, which (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Because you felt like once you got the right to vote, that would lead to other things?
Speaker 2: You, you, you would get everything else that you needed, you see, because then you could change the whole structure and face of things, and that was very clear to us.  Plus, in Mississippi, it was much too dangerous to be--spending yourself risking a hamburger, something like that, you know.  So you had to go for the--you had to go to the heart of the matter and the heart of the matter was voter registration--
Story_ID: 196793
Speaker 1: You know, and at the time you became involved in the Civil Rights Movement, you were a mother, a woman, not your typical civil rights--not the picture of like your typical civil rights activist.  What was that like for you?  I mean, were you ever threatened?  Was it ever hard on your--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.
Speaker 1: --children?  And what--
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: --was it like?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, all of the above.  But, you know, you, you had to, you had to make a decision.  You, you--were you going to allow yourself to be frightened off or did you understand what you were doing and why you were doing it, you know, and what that all required.  Let me just say that there were not--you're right, there were not very many people in the movement in my age group, you know, et cetera, and that was because you didn't have very many independent--people who were independent.  You know, I had my own home; I had had my own home all my life, so I didn't know what it was to be threatened about somebody putting me out, you know, closing on my mortgage or, or nothing like that.  Ever since I knew myself, I had my, my name was on a piece of--a deed that said this is my land, okay?  I was my own boss, you know, so I didn't have to be afraid of any of that.  So that was somewhat unique; I mean, that, that, that was not a--an average thing.  And I had always had a very deep concern for the difference in living in Mississippi and the difference in living in other places, and I had lived in many other places.  And I could--you know, I felt like if you can--if I was, you know, okay in other places, I ought to be okay in Mississippi and so I was--I--as I'm--as I waded in, you know, I just waded all the way in.

Speaker 1: --I remember, specifically, one morning somewhere in the neighbor between midnight and dawn my phone rang, and we didn't have but one phone in those days, and that was in the living room.  So I stumbles out of my bed, you know, and gets to the phone.  Don't know what, what in the world is going on this time of morning as you always do when your phone ring after a certain time of night.  And I pick up the phone and it's this, "We're gonna get you.  You're on our list.  You're gonna float like Mack Charles Parker."  And before I can even gather my wits, you know, they hung up, of course.  Mack Charles Parker was a black man who had recently been lynched in Pearl River County [Mississippi] nearby.  I can't even tell you how you feel behind something like that.  I certainly was not gonna tell my family about this, but I did tell some of the young people about this the next day, and by way of the grapevine, the word got back to Medgar [Evers].  I tell this because I--
Speaker 2: Medgar Evers?
Speaker 1: --I remember it so vividly, and it was--you know, it was such a kind thing to do on his part.  What had happened--and he called me, you know, to let me know that I was not alone.  He never attempted to tell me, you know, don't pay any attention; he, he never took that route at all, but he just said, "You know, you just have to--you have to decide whether or not what you're doing is important enough to keep on doing it because nothing is going to get better if you do--I mean, if you don't.  So--and just know that there are, there are some, some others of us out here who, who are with you and share it."  And I always remember that because within two weeks he was dead.
Speaker 2: What impact did his death have on you?
Speaker 1: Well, it, it just sent--you know, it just, just made you much more deeply aware, if you needed to be made more deeply aware, that these people were not kidding.  They were playing for keeps.  Because you just would not have expected them to, to take the life of a person with such high visibility and such, you know, national, nationally known.  So--but at the same time, it also strengthened your determination to keep going.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 196795
Speaker 1: Let's talk about in 1963, you made history in the State of Mississippi as the first female to run for--
Speaker 2: National.
Speaker 1: --national office.  What office did you run for and why did you decide to do that?
Speaker 2: I ran for state senator, for the senator.  I ran against Senator [John] Stennis who was, you know, well planted at that time.  I did it because nobody else would do it.  They--you know, there was an effort to find someone who was willing to do it and--
Speaker 1: What was the purpose of running for office senate?  Did you really think you were gonna win?
Speaker 2: Of course not.
Speaker 1: Why--so why did you do it?
Speaker 2: It's--and when you say win, I'm assuming you're speaking of win in the usual, you know, thinking win.
Speaker 1: Right.  'Cause even though you didn't win the seat, it was a victory for you.
Speaker 2: But, you know, you had to decide--you had to determine what was a win for yourself, you know.  And, of course, you know, I would--I think I have fairly common sense and I knew full well that with a handful of black voters in Mississippi, maybe that numerically, there was no way, but I understood that this was an opportunity to teach, to encourage, okay?  And to empower black power to register to vote to see someone who looked like them actually on the ballot running against Stennis had to say, "Wait a minute.  Maybe if I was registered, you know, she could win."  Also, they understood the danger of that and so it--was an experience that both educated, inspired, encouraged and empowered people to get registered to vote.
Story_ID: 196796
Speaker 1: And let's talk about the creation of--or the establishment of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP); why was there a need to create another party?
Speaker 2: Because you were not permitted to participate in the existing party.  We tried everything in the books and anything that we could imagine trying to become, you know, participants in the party as it was then existence.  And then we had some very good lawyers and some very smart interns and all this sort of thing and they stumbled up on something that says, "You know, if your government ain't serving your needs, you--you know, then you create one that will serve your needs."  So certainly, the, the polit--the Democratic establishment in Mississippi was not serving the needs of black people so it was time to do something about that.  Actually, it start--act--actually started out as what we called the freedom vote.  You know, one of the things that the, that the local white folks said was, "Black folks don't want to vote.  You know, they're--not interested in voting."  So we decided to do a freedom vote, run a freedom campaign.  Aaron Henry, who we talked about, I think, at some point there, was the--was gonna--was running for governor, and [Edwin] "Ed" King, the only native white Mississippian that participated in the movement early on ran as lieutenant governor, okay?  And we had to go out and register votes so we could carry out our mock election, and we registered somewhere between 75 and 100,000 people in whatever time frame was--it was, at that time.  And we held our election, of course, you know, and our candidates won, you know, and, and we--and, and actually, this was not just a, you know, an act in futility, we used all this as evidence when we went before the [Democratic] National Convention in Atlantic City [New Jersey] in--
Speaker 1: In 19--
Speaker 2: --nineteen sixty-four [1964], to say, "Hey, oh yes, they will.  Oh yes, we will."  But in the meantime, it was--that, that--from that, that idear eventually emerged, the idea of organizing our own party.  And so we did and we did it according to the, you know, the rules and regulations and criteria, if you will, of organizing, you know, a party and how that party is supposed to function.  And we held precinct meetings and we held, you know, we held county meetings and, and eventually, we held the state convention.  And by the time we got to the state convention, we was on our way to Atlantic City.
Speaker 1: 'Cause you'd chosen your delegates.
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: So you, Fannie Lou Hamer, Annie [Bell Robinson] Devine were among the chosen?
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were among the chosen.
Story_ID: 196797
Speaker 1: What happened when you got to Atlantic City [New Jersey for the Democratic National Convention]?
Speaker 2: Well, Aaron Henry was chairman of the delegation; Mrs. [Fannie Lou] Hamer was vice-chairman of the delegation; I believe Peggy J. Connor was the secretary; and Mrs. [Annie Bell Robinson] Devine was the treasurer or vice versa.  I was the national committeewoman and [Edwin] "Ed" King was the national committeeman, and so our--you know, our delegation was organized to the teeth; I mean, we had everything in place.  And what we did--our primary thing once we got to Atlantic City was to visit the other delegations from around the country and invite, encourage, you know, people to support us when our, our challenge came before the body, and so that's what we were doing, you know, different ones were going here, there and over; we covered the waterfront in the process.  In the meantime, we were having--there were quite a few of the high profiled black leadership--national black leadership there also and they were being urged by the political establishment, the [President Lyndon Baines] Johnson establishment to encourage us, first of all, to-- carry a low profile, but ultimately, they decided when they saw it, they really weren't gonna be able to persuade us to not go through with our plan.  They finally decided that they would offer us two seats at-large with no vote.  And not only did they decide to offer us two seats at-large, but they decided who was gonna sit in those seats, that's, that's neither here nor there.  So we're coming out of a meeting, one of those meetings where we were trying to convince people, you know, why we need to be seated and we're met by the press and wanting to know, you know, we've se--we've accepted the seats and we didn't even know the seats had ever been of--offered.  But what had happened was the legal leadership, along with the other folks that we just talked about, they had apparently agreed either to accept the seats, or to, to encourage us to accept--I--I'm not sure about, about that part of it, all I know is that we were flabbergasted that we had accepted two seats at-large.  And so at that point, we withdrew and went into a secluded place, the entire delegation, sixty-eight of us, to talk about this because we now, you know, were aware of this and, and what was gonna be our response; what was gonna, what was gonna be the official response.  And we spent quite a bit of time with that, but when we came out of there, we knew full well that two seats at-large didn't represent anybody.  We knew full well we came to Atlantic City because we needed representation; we knew full well that a lot of people, number one, had died and a lot of people--few more people were probably gonna die, you know, in that process.  And so we weren't about to betray the memory of those who had died, and you know, those who would and so we did not accept it.  We chose not to accept those two seats at-large.  And the pictures and stuff that you see that all of this was aftermath, in terms of what we, what we were doing there.
Story_ID: 196798
Speaker 1: We decided to, when the [Democratic National] Convention was over, to come back in Mississippi and keep fighting.  So we came back and we decided to go (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) But you were seated though, weren't you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, no.
Speaker 2: Okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, no.  We refused the seats.  We refused the two seats at-large, but when the regular delegation heard that we had been offered the two seats, they--the majority of them walked out.
Speaker 2: And when they walked out, what did you all do?
Speaker 1: We went and sat in the seats.
Speaker 2: And what was--
Speaker 1: But that was a protest.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: We weren't really seated.
Speaker 2: And what was the reaction of the delegates around you?
Speaker 1: We had a lot of support.  We had a lot--well, we couldn't have gotten in the hall if we hadn't had support.  We--you know, the people in the hall would go in and then they would get--send their ID back out to us, and so eventually, we all got up in there, the most of us got up in there, particularly from the [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP)] delegation.  And so we just decided, okay, you know, we're not gonna go back and lie and pretend we've got something that we haven't.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you something about that day though.  There's a very well known, very famous photograph that was taken of you and some others holding signs; can you kind of take us back a little bit and tell us a little bit about, you know, what you were thinking and what you hoped you were representing?  And also what your thoughts are today, because it is a very famous photograph.
Speaker 1: You know, now let me be very clear, I don't have a clue when that photograph was made, you know.  But the thing was when we had actually gotten ourselves into that hall, once we were in, we just, you know--this was a--
Speaker 2: What does your sign say?
Speaker 1: This was victorious.  I don't know, what does it say?  I don't even remember.
Speaker 2: It said something about--I guess something about the right to vote.
Speaker 1: I'm sure it did.  I don't even remember, to be perfectly clear.
Speaker 2: So are you surprised that it became such a famous photograph?
Speaker 1: Yes, very surprised.  Like I said, I don't, I don't have a clue when it was made in the first place, you know, it was being made.
Speaker 2: What does it represent to you when you look at it today?
Speaker 1: Oh, it, it, it represents the fact that I was, in fact, a part of what I consider the most significant happening in the history of this country.  And when I say that, I say that with--unconditionally, because it really did change the direction ultimately, of not just the Democratic Party, but the political, you know, arena period, period, and it took a while.  That was, you know, that was our first visible, highly visible victory, but every time, you know, one more person went down to that registrar's office knowing that once they left there they could lose their job, they could lose their home, they could lose their life, okay?  And but yeah, we kept going--
Story_ID: 196799
Speaker 1: Let's talk about Freedom Summer 1964; what was happening in Hattiesburg [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, Hattiesburg probably had the largest and mo--let's just put it this way, largest campaign of anywhere in the state, okay?  And I think a part of that was because we did a lot of CEP [Citizenship Education Program] work in-- Hattiesburg.  And consequently, we were always kind of at the center of moving things along.  The first Freedom Day was held in Hattiesburg, you see.  This was, this was where we had just run out of options and all.  We're trying to make this, this man register people to vote, and so an invitation was sent to the National Council of Churches [NCC] to send in people to support the local people who were going to turn out in large numbers to try to, you know, inundate the registrar, and of course, that was very dangerous, as you know.  And so I guess we were most surprised because we, we knew we were gonna get a response, but we thought it would probably be very small.  The day before Freedom Day, the designated Freedom Day, these ministers started pouring in from all over the country, and by the time Freedom Day dawned, we had upwards of between fifty and seventy-five ministers had responded again, from all over the country, from the different faith groups, traditions, et cetera.  In fact, we had all these people here and having where to put them.  I had a great big rambling house and we had--there wasn't--we had people in sleeping bags, we had people wherever they could get (laughter).
Story_ID: 196800
Speaker 1: So we were talking a little bit about Freedom Summer 1964, and you talked about Freedom Day.
Speaker 2: Freedom Day, you--yes, which, which was--may very well have been something of precursor to Freedom Summer.  Anyway, what was going on in Hattiesburg [Mississippi] was really your original question.  And at that time, we were--you know, after, after Freedom Day, activity escalated.  We continued to do what we were doing, recruiting new--our teachers for Citizenship Education [Program, CEP] classes, working with the young people or some not so young going--actually going out into the community, knocking on people's doors.  Sitting and talking with them, excha--excha--you know, encouraging them to continue to, to go down to their registrar's office because that is the only way, you know, that things were going to change.  So we were, we were quite busy.  We were quite busy.  We were very much a part of the move toward Freedom Summer.  I was a part of the group that went to Oxford [Ohio] how--to do training.  In fact, I was in the second group.  The first group went up and Michael [Schwerner] and [James Earl] Chaney were in the first group of trainers; [Andrew] Goodman was one of the volunteers who had been trained and came back to Mississippi with them.  Schwerner's wife, Rita [Schwerner Bender], was with me and Mrs. [Annie Bell Robinson] Devine and whoever else was riding in our car.  We went up to replace the group that returned.  The, the first group returned to Mississippi and the next group came up to take up the next week, and Schwerner's wife was--in the car with those of us who went up.  And we got in Saturday night.  Well, they had left Saturday morning going back to Mississippi; we got into Oxford Saturday night to get people going on--to begin the new week on Sunday.  And, and before the day was over on Sunday, word came with that the three young men were missing, and of course, those of us who knew, knew when the word came that they were missing that they were most likely, dead; we knew that, but you didn't say that.  At any rate--
Speaker 1: Did his wife--what was his wife's reaction?
Speaker 2: Oh, they just simply took Rita and headed back to Mississippi--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know, several of the guys because they, they were quite certain.  I mean, we were quite certain of what, what the ultimate outcome was gonna be there.  And it was a, a very traumatic experience, but, you know, one of the, the glue, I believe, as one person put it, that held the movement together was song and singing.
Story_ID: 196801
Speaker 1: And I remember that Sunday night after the word had finally been given to the gathered body, the larger body, you know, what had happened [murder of Michael Schwerner, James Earl Chaney, and Andrew Goodman], what we had heard, not what had happened, but what we had heard--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --and our own take on what that all really meant, ultimately.  A group of us had gathered someplace there in a room, and we were all--you know, we were all just kind of like speechless, you know, just all sitting, everybody with their own private thoughts.  And, eventually, very, very--somewhere in the group started to sing very softly, "Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.  Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.  Kumbaya, my Lord, Kumbaya.  Oh, Lord, Kumbaya."  And then people began to sing and express themselves in song when we were unable to express ourselves, you know, in speech, per se.  And some said, "Your children are hurting, Lord, Kumbaya."  Somebody else would say, "Your children are dying, Lord, Kumbaya."  And pretty soon by the time, you know, we had sung it out, we had found what we needed, the strength that we needed and the courage to get up Monday morning and continue to process with those who were there.  And I, I share this because it was just such a wonderful moment of how faith plays into this--any struggle, any struggle, and that song and that singing is primary in helping that to happen.
Story_ID: 196802
Speaker 1: Let's talk about what happened in 1968; you, Annie [Bell Robinson] Devine and Fannie Lou Hamer were seated guests on the floor of the U.S. [House of Representatives]--
Speaker 2: Oh, no.  No, this was in 1965.  See, this is where a lot of people--what a lot of people miss.  After we [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) delegation] left Atlantic City [New Jersey] in 1964, we went back to Mississippi and decided to challenge the seating of the congressional delegation, okay?  So we did.  We con--we challenged the seating.  We did our work, continued to do our work.  Gathered all, all the evidence one could ever need, did everything we needed to do to prove that these people had no business occupying the seats, the congressional seats.  And so we went back--
Speaker 1: Because--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: --to [Washington] D.C.
Speaker 1: --the people hadn't vote--everyone hadn't voted for these represent--so they weren't representing everybody?
Speaker 2: Not only had they not voted, they had done everything they could to keep you from voting still, okay?  We gathered--I'll--remind me, I'll show you when it--when we finish, we gathered evidence this thick.  You know, people who stood and told their stories, what happened to them trying to get registered to vote in Mississippi, okay?
Speaker 1: So what happened when you got to D.C.?
Speaker 2: When we went back to, to protest the seating and challenge the seating of the regular delegation, first of all, they tried to play games with us.  They--you know, they--could not deny us the process because here again, they went and dug out some of those laws on the books that gave every--you know, permission to do this.  We were within our constitutional rights to challenge these guys and we were following the process for doing that, you know, like step by step by step; we weren't missing any.  So we were--had to--the first thing we would, would have to do was come before a subcommittee, you know, to put our stuff on the table.  But prior to that, the information had to be printed and the clerk of the house, it was his responsibility to print and bind the information that we provided, that we would be using in our, in our challenge.  They kept messing around, you know, and weren't doing anything about it, so finally we decided that we had to go down to the house of the office of the clerk and see what was his problem--
Story_ID: 196803
Speaker 1: I--at that time, I was managing the off--the Washington [D.C.] office of MFDP [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party], so we got together whoever was available and we went down to the [U.S.] Capitol [Washington, D.C.] to meet with the, the clerk of the house.  And we went in and, and, and presented ourselves and asked, you know, to meet with him, and they pretended for a few minutes, you know, maybe we were gonna meet with him.  And they let us sit around, you know, and then they come back and said, "Oh, you know, he can't see you yet."  So they messed around with us off and on all day, thinking we were gonna leave, but we wouldn't leave.  So finally, it was getting toward the end of the day and he said, "Well, if you'll come back--he had--he was called away today," or some--such excuse, "but if you'll come back," and told us when to come back, "he'll meet with you."  I said, "Okay.  Would you write that appointment down for us?"  So the guy looked at me, but he went ahead and wrote it down and handed it to me.  I said, "Now, would you please sign it?"  So he signed it.  I said, "Thank you," and we left.  So at the appointed time that we had a written appointment to meet with the clerk, we went back, and they started their same game.  Somebody had died in his family, something had happened, so we just said, "Okay.  Well, he'll be back.  We'll wait."
Speaker 2: But eventually, you were seated?
Speaker 1: Yeah, four years later.
Speaker 2: Right, in 1968?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This is 1965, we're talking about now.
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.  But you were seated in 1968?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the delegation was seated in 1968.  Yeah, but--you see, what, what I-- don't want you to miss--
Speaker 2: Sure.  Sure.
Speaker 1: --is the process.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: It's all about process.
Speaker 2: Right.  Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: So how long did it take to finally--
Speaker 1: Well, it--
Speaker 2: --get that appointment?
Speaker 1: We--they took us to jail because we refused to leave the clerk's office, so--
Speaker 2: In 1960--this is--
Speaker 1: In 1965.
Speaker 2: --still--
Speaker 1: In 1965.  So it was time to go home and we were still sitting there and we refused to leave, so they said, "Well, if you don't leave, we're gonna have to arrest you."  We said, "Well, we're waiting for Mr.--" whatever his name.  I can't even remember his name now.  So they called the cops in, they loaded us up and took us to jail.
Story_ID: 196804
Speaker 1: I have to tell you this.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: So they eventually--we [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation] stayed in jail.  We decided not to go out right away, stay a while.  And finally, when they finally set a date for our hearing, we, we--you know, we were gotten out and, and, and let go.  And so when time--the date for the trial came, we were all there, and I didn't--I couldn't believe how serious they were.  They really intended to do us in.  And--but we had a great lawyer and--Attorney [Herbert O.] Reid [Sr.] --professor at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  And so I had told him, he said what, what, you know, we were talking about what our reports was gonna be and everything, so he said, "Well, what, what are you gonna do?  How are we gonna do this?  You trespassed.  They're accusing you of trespass."  I said, "We weren't trespassing."  He said, "You were trespassing."  I said, "No, we weren't either.  We had an appointment."  He said, "You did?"  I said, "Yeah.  Can you prove it?"  And so I reached my purse and handed my, my signed appoint--he--the man was--he was so pleased (laughter).  He was, he was so excited when he found out that we had absolute proof that we had an appointment.  And so they carried on this stuff and then at the--then I was called to the stand.  And when I was called to the stand, "How do you plead?"  And I said, "Not guilty."  And- the pro--you know, I said, "Well, we had an appointment."  And of course, Mr. Reid went through the thing like, you know, boom, boom, boom.  And I said--he said, "Do you have anything?"  I said, "Yes, sir," and I reached and handed him the, the appointment.  When he saw that, the whole courtroom went up.  The cameras starting flashing, just blew everybody away.  That stuff was out the window, out the window.
Story_ID: 196805
Speaker 1: Anyway, be that as it may, finally we [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party delegation] did get down, you know, to do--to go before the subcommittee.  And we were very, very disappointed because we wanted the, the hearing to be public, but they would not let us do our presentation in a public hearing, we did it in a closed hearing because they just, you know, that's what they did; they, they had the ability to do it and so they did.  But anyway, on the--on that day, finally, when it was to go before the body, we had been invited to sit on the floor of the house by Congressman [William Fitts] Ryan from New York, but I have to tell you this.  Prior to that, the gathering, convening, you had to go down this long hall to get into the floor--get onto the floor of the [U.S.] House [of Representatives], and we had people that come bus--by the busloads and everybody was wearing signs and they were standing on each side of the hall.  Nobody was saying anything, they were just standing there with their signs telling their story.  And this particular person, congressperson, was heard to say--you know, he had never really taken the challenge seriously.  He hadn't given any kind of thought as a serious thing.  He said but by the time he walked down that hall and looked at those people standing there and read those signs that those people had, he realized this was serious business and he had to take a stand, and he did, along with the--you know, a sizeable number of others.  But we're getting ready to go on the floor, here comes word from one of our, again, national leaders, "We think that the ladies shouldn't go on the floor.  You all--"talking to that lawyer"--you all need to go out there and tell them don't do that because we think it will hurt, you know, the support that we're gonna get."  So the lawyers told, told him, "Man, you don't know these folk yet, do you?"
Speaker 2: You don't know these ladies (laughter).
Speaker 1: We ain't going out there and telling them ladies what to do.  Now, you go out there and tell them ladies what your suggestion is 'cause we're not gonna do it.  And we certainly, you know, ain't gonna try to make that decision for 'em.  So he came out there and we, in short, we just told him, "Thanks, but no thanks.  We're going on the floor.  That's--you know, we've been invited, we've come here to go there, and all those black people sitting up there in those balconies who have come from everywhere to see us walk down that--aisle, we gonna walk down that aisle, and if that means that the vote is going to, you know, go the other way, let it go."  And so we did and once again, history, (laughter) which we were--certainly weren't thinking about history at that point (laughter).
Story_ID: 196806
Speaker 1: Oftentimes when people talk about what happened in Atlantic City [New Jersey] at the Democratic National Convention in 1964, the name that you hear often is Fannie Lou Hamer, and then, you know, we talk about Freedom Summer and that kind of thing; do you ever feel like she gets way too much credit?  Because, you know, your name and Annie [Bell Robinson] Devine's name aren't often mentioned.
Speaker 2: There was a picture sitting here somewhere of Fannie Lou.
Speaker 1: I think it's in--back here.
Speaker 2: Anyway, no.  When you stop and realize where Ms. Hamer came from, and you realize that had it not been for that movement, this woman would have been born, lived, and died, and nobody would've ever known the gift and gifts that she had to share.  And in terms of 1964 in Atlantic City, the thing that really, really scared the pants off of the powers at be was Mrs. Hamer's testimony before the credentials committee; that, that is what just tore the whole thing wide open and it made the President Lyndon [Baines] Johnson, so angry he called a press conference to take her--you know, her testimony from going out.  And the interesting thing about that, and this is what I--this is the part that I really like, they thought they had the thing all sealed, you know and everything, because they figured that Rita's [Rita Schwerner Bender] testimony was gonna be the controversial testimony because her husband [Michael Schwerner] was one of the three young men who was killed.  So they had already planned that when Rita's testimony was being given, they were gonna cut out the--cut the lines, you know, they weren't going to, to, to broadcast her testimony.  They never thought that a field hand from the Mississippi Delta was gonna be the problem child (laughter), and by the time they, they realized what it was, of course, it--was too late, the damage was already done.  He called this press conference and the guys went, but somebody's camera kept rolling, and that night, the entire testimony was broadcast to the whole round world, and that really did it, that really did it.  No, I--have--I--not for one minute has Mrs.--whatever notoriety she enjoyed and her memory still enjoys, and you'd probably be surprised to know how broad and wide that is, she deserved every bit of it and more.
Story_ID: 196807
Speaker 1: What did you know about her [Fannie Lou Hamer] that you think the general public probably didn't know?
Speaker 2: Well, my favorite--one of my favorite things that I share, and I did this just the other day in Atlantic City [New Jersey] again.  I don't know if you know this, but the secretary of state of New Jersey, she has a real passion for the legacy of Fannie Lou Hamer; she just completed a year of celebration of the legacy of Fannie Lou Hamer across New Jersey.  And what I like that she's doing is she makes sure that the young people know about this woman.  But, anyway, just a few days ago, I had an opportunity to talk about Mrs. Hamer in the final event--activity of the, the year-long event that had been going on there.  And I shared this--wherever I talk about Mrs. Hamer, she was a deeply spiritual person and she was not just one who talked to talk, she walked the talk.  And her favorite--one of her favorite scriptures, certainly, I share wherever we talk and that's the sixth chapter of Ephesians.  I always start about the tenth verse, you can start anywhere you want to.  But it talks about the whole armor of God and oftentimes, you know, when faced with real challenging things, she would talk that scripture, putting on the whole armor of God and what that really meant to her; that is number one.  Number two, she also had a--great sense of humor, I mean, really and truly and she could keep you laughing.  Sometimes, of course, when she'd be telling her story, she could make you cry, but she could also make you laugh just as hard as you cry with, with her, I call them Fannie Louisms like--let me share one with you.  "I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired," now that is a Fannie Louism.  She is the lady that first spoke those words, but now you can hear them anywhere from the White House [Washington, D.C.] to the outhouse and beyond, you know.  And that was--you know, she had that, that, that, that ability to take a situation and just size it up, you know, and put it into a few words that would be very humorous but not less true, you know, no less true.  So those two things, I think, that the general public may not know was her deep spirituality and her excellent sense of humor and it was totally natural.
Story_ID: 196808
Speaker 1: In 1968, you married your second husband [Reuben Earnest Adams, Jr.], and you all left the country, moved to--overseas; did you feel like you were leaving the [Civil Rights] Movement behind or were you, were you--or did you feel like you were taking it with you?
Speaker 2: That was a, that was a very challenging moment.  We married in 1966, by the way.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It's okay.  That was a very challenging moment.  We left this country in 1968.  I talked with Mrs. [Ella] Baker; you're familiar with Ella Baker?  As I told you, I wrote her there.  And I was telling her, you know, how much I regretted leaving the country at this point, but at the same time, I also had a, a deep sense of, of loyalty to my husband because he had said very clearly that he was not gonna leave the country again unless his family was with him.  And I knew what his career meant to him, and I knew he was, you know, coming fairly close to the end of the career which would mean an awful lot after having spent his life in it.  And, and so it was a matter of having to decide, you know, where did my loyalty lie at this particular moment in my journey?  And so I, I was just sharing with her, you know, the agony of being torn like this and she said, and I always remember that, "Mrs. Gray [HistoryMaker Victoria Adams], we do--we have different things that we are called to do at different points in our journey.  Right now you're being called to be with your family, so I would say to you go without regrets.  There'll be plenty to do here when you get back."
Speaker 1: And when did you return to the country?
Speaker 2: We came back in '72 [1972].
Story_ID: 196809
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you become involved in, in 1972?
Speaker 2: Well, I never--you know--let's back up.  You said something earlier.  I contended there that all movements of--purpose are composed of two constituencies.  There's one group that's in the movement and there's another group the movement is in them, okay?  For those who are in the movement, they make their contribution, they move on, it's okay; but those who the movement is in, you're hooked; you never, you never get over it.  So wherever you are there will always be needs, unmet needs, unaddressed needs, and it makes no difference where you are.  If the movement is in you, you're going to be aware of, and when you become aware of, you have to do something, you can't just be aware of.  So I--you know, I have not been anywhere in the world that I've not found needs at the local level that needed identifying, needed addressing.  And as I told you as I was when I was very young, I always had an opinion and I always shared it.  I feel the same way, if there's something there and I feel I have something to offer to meet it, you know, then I offer it, and there will always be something there to offer it.  When we came back--now to catch up with you--when we came back--I did a lot of things in Thailand, you'd be surprised.  When--
Speaker 1: Like what?  What were some of the things you did?
Speaker 2: Well, one of the things that I did--you shouldn't have asked me that--one of the things that I did that I've always been very proud of is I organized the African American Women in Thailand.  One of the things that bothered me was I never saw African American women at PTA [parent teacher association], I didn't see African American women at church, I didn't see, I didn't see African American women in those places that I felt I should've seen 'em.  But if you wanted to know if they, they--if you--the way you found out they were in Thailand was go to the club on Saturday night and there they were, okay?  Well, that's okay, I don't have a thing against that, 'cause I went to the club on Saturday night, too, but there were other things that needed attention--
Story_ID: 196810
Speaker 1: So I started kind of feeling my way, you know, talking to my hairdresser, which I--'cause I didn't know a lot of them because I never saw them unless you went to the club, and my hairdresser was one of them.  And she--there was another person who she also did her hair and she said, "You know, you two people need to get together because you all think alike."  And then something happened that, you know, gave, gave the--a reason for getting people to move.  They were--one of the teachers was having some kind of essay contest or writing thing in her class, and so one of the students wrote this thing up there about niggers and animals, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  And, and the little black kids in the class were very upset about it because she put it on the bulletin board and they, they, you know, they felt bad about that.  So they came home and told their parents about it, and one of the parents that they told my hairdresser's husband, who was very volatile (laughter).  And so, so James [ph.] went down to the, to the school to find out, you know, if what his child had told him was true, and sure enough when he got down there, there it was up on the bulletin board.  You know, his little essay was up there big and--so he asked the teacher, you know, why would she allow that?  She said, "Well, you know, it's about freedom of speech Mr. (unclear) James."  And, of course, James, as I said, was a very volatile person.  He told her, "That, that ain't freedom of speech," et cetera, et cetera.  But anyway, so, so I told Gina [ph.], I say, "We got it."  We sat down and we wrote letters, To Whom It May Concern, and we gave them to our children and told them to give them to each black child on their campus.  We called a meeting at my house and twelve women showed up on the day of the meeting and we talked about this.  And everybody was upset.  They were really angry.  I said, "Okay, let's don't just get angry, let's see what we can do about it."  And so around, around that particular event, we, we began the process of organizing African American women in Bangkok, Thailand to become visible in the larger community.  And we ended up, you know, having a direct line to the wife of the American ambassador to Thailand, among others, and we did a lot of really wonderful things as a result of that.  When I left in Thailand in '72 [1972], the organization was still going strong.  That was one of the things that we did while we were there and then we came home, you know.  It took a little while when we got home to kind of, you know, get settled in again, but then lo and behold, we lived--for the first time, we actually lived on the installation--military installation.
Speaker 2: And where was that?
Speaker 1: This was at Fort Myer in northern Virginia.
Story_ID: 196811
Speaker 1: So we were talking about northern Virginia [Fort Myer, Virginia] and some of the--I think you said the wives club, some of the junior soldiers?
Speaker 2: Yeah, the young soldiers, actually, with families that, that the women--I didn't realize how much they didn't have; you know, just a little, little joys that you ought to have, so I started working on behalf of these women, organizing them.
Speaker 1: Helping to make their lives better?
Speaker 2: Helping to make their lives better, opening up those clubs to those women, you know, at--so that they would have access and that sort of thing.  So, like I said, you know, lo and behold, you know, there it is.  And when we came to Fort Lee [Virginia], it was no different.  Got to Fort Lee, I became--
Speaker 1: Fort Lee, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Became--eventually became president of the wives club down there.  And it came to my attention that there were women who were wives of NCOs [noncommissioned officer], but they weren't allowed to be a part of NCO  wives club unless their husbands belonged to the NCO club.  I said, "That's ridiculous.  You're mean."  So we set out to do something about that and we did which took us all the way to the top.  We ended up with leading with the post commander.
Speaker 1: And got the rule changed?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.  Absolutely.
Story_ID: 196812
Speaker 1: And so in the late '70s [1970s], you also embarked on a real estate career; and how did you continue with your activism and, and your need to help others through real estate?
Speaker 2: Well, that was, you know, that was one of the most beautiful opportunities, you know, to, to be able to assist people and to make them aware that they could in fact, what do they say, own a piece of the rock?  They could in fact, you know, enjoy the American dream of owning their homes; was just one of the most satisfying parts of being in real estate, really and truly.
Speaker 1: And were you surprised that there were so many people out there who didn't think home ownership could be attainable?
Speaker 2: Yes, because see, I had not really been exposed to how--you know, how significant--how, how, how little people realized the importance of home ownership because see, once--you become a property owner, you're, you're put into a whole different place, you know.  As long as you rent, you're spending your money, but when you purchase, you're investing your money, and when you invest your money, that always gives you the wherewithal to do other things much easier than you ever could do it without it.  And so oftentimes, I would get a call and the people would be looking for something to rent, and you know, I always invited people, but then when I qualify my clients or prospective clients, and I see what they were capable of, I would say, "Well, why are you renting?  Why don't you purchase?"  And they said, "Oh, I, I--I'm not able to purchase."  And I said, "Why aren't you able to purchase?"  You know, and then they'll go to telling me, you know, what they--I said, "No, no, no.  You, you have--if what you have given me here is correct, you can purchase and you will actually be spending less money purchasing than you are spending renting and that was kind of my approach with people.  And you'd be surprised at the numbers of people--
Story_ID: 196813
Speaker 1: In 1989, you became the campus minister at Virginia State University [VSU, Petersburg, Virginia]; how did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: Once again, by not keeping my mouth shut (laughter).  No, I couldn't figure out why the--well, first of all, let me back up a little bit.  I'm Methodist, as I said earlier, and I was really surprised when I came to Petersburg [Virginia] to find no United Methodist church in the black community.  You know, at that time, Petersburg had a population of forty thousand people and I couldn't believe there was not a single black United Methodist church in Petersburg, 'cause what I didn't know at that time, not only in Petersburg, not in the Petersburg district, which covers most of south side Virginia.  And so anyway, I said, "Well, now I know very well that on that campus there has to be young people who are coming there who are United Methodist, so what do they do?"  You know, "Where do they go?"  And so I just started asking questions, asking questions.  And then I found out not only, you know, was this true in, in the student community, but it was also true in the faculty community.  Some of the faculty who were United Methodist drove to Richmond [Virginia], you know, in order to have a, a home congregation that they could attach themselves to.  That's downright ridiculous, you know, in a city this size.  So any process of following that up and asking questions and asking questions, came to find out that there was not a campus minister over there either, period; no Methodist, Baptist, whatever.  There was no campus minister there.  So anyway, what really happened was some person over there requested a campus minister to begin a Wesley Foundation, which is sponsored by the Methodist church at Virginia State.  And so they got in touch with the district superintendent who lives in Petersburg, and--about it, and so she--we had, had our first female district superintendent in Pet--in the Petersburg district.  And so Cynthia [ph.] invited me and--'cause she's heard me, complaining about stuff, invited me and a few other people to meet with the person at Virginia State who had made the request for someone to come and, and, and institute a-- Wesley Foundation--
Speaker 1: Um-hm--
Speaker 2: --at Virginia State because all the other state schools have Wesley Foundations, so he wanted to know why don't we have one at VSU, you know.  The others were white.  Okay, here we go again.  Anyway, it, it grew out of that, out of that, and as we explored that and had several meetings bringing in some of the existing campus ministers.  So we finally came to the point where we agreed and they agreed that we really did want to do it because we needed to do it.
Story_ID: 196814
Speaker 1: Then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Did you minister to all students [at Virginia State University, Petersburg, Virginia]?
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely.  I wouldn't, I wouldn't (unclear), you know, minister everybody.
Speaker 2: Not just Methodist students, but--
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Speaker 2: --all students?
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  Absolutely.  My--I, I--as I ended up in the position, which I certainly never even dreamed.  Now, that's--see, that's, that's, that's how the spirit tells you, it takes you places you never even gave a thought to, you know.  But anyway, the question was--came up in this particular meeting, "Well, who are we going to send?"  Cynthia [ph.] said, "Do you think that your campus community would accept a white person as a campus minister?"  And some of them say, "Yeah, I, I think they would."  You know, "I, I think they would accept a white person as campus minister."  But one young white campus minister was in there and he said, "I--now, wait a minute."  He said, "Now, I think we're, I think we're setting this up to fail."  He said, "Now, we gonna come in here and institute a Wesley Foundation, something that is totally, you know, foreign to the people and we gonna bring a white fellow in here to this pr--you know, all predominantly black campus?  I'm not at all sure that we're serious about making this work.  I think we need to do--we need to take another turn here."  Cynthia said, "Well, I don't have anything."  Cynthia was the district superintendent, she said, "I don't have any, any black ministers in the Petersburg [Virginia] district."  So, well, I kind of sat in the bleacher, finally one of the guys said, "Well, you know as I recall, campus ministers do not have to be ordained ministers, they just have to be people who are committed, you know, and, and understand what this is all about.  So who said it got to be ordained?  I think we've got people that could handle this."  And about this time, I felt all eyes like fixing up on me, you know.  And Cynthia said, "Yeah, I think you're right.  I think maybe she's sitting right here in this room."  And I said, "Uh uh, no you don't either."  You know, I'm talking to this like I, I got this conversation going on in my head 'cause I already got more things to do than I have time to do.  But anyway, when it was over, I was given until lunch to make up my mind, which was about two hours away.  Anyway, I went through this argument with myself and I said, "Well, [HistoryMaker] Victoria [Adams], you know, you've been griping and grumming, and all this sort of thing, so maybe you're the one."  I had about as much sense of what a campus minister would do or anything else (laughter), but I did, I accepted it and it went on from there.
Story_ID: 196815
Speaker 1: Are you still currently an adjunct professor at Southern Miss [University of Southern Mississippi, Hattiesburg, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No, no.  After my husband [Reuben Earnest Adams, Jr.] became ill, I backed out on a--lot of things.  I--I've gradually, you know, upped the ante a little bit in doing things, but I'm not going to commit to anything.
Speaker 1: But you were an adjunct professor there?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I, I taught there for a semester, was invited to do that--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And you taught--
Speaker 2: --after that.
Speaker 1: --studies in civil rights?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.  Civil rights history.
Speaker 1: Civil rights history?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And I'm sure that was exciting for the students--
Speaker 2: Oh, very, very, very, very.
Speaker 1: --to have someone who had lived civil rights history teach it.
Speaker 2: What was disappointing was the absence of black students.  We had a couple of black students who, you know, thought it was worth the time, et cetera.  But let me just tell you how exciting it really was.  I'm gonna give you just a couple of examples.  We're working away one day and this young white boy--most, most of my students also were grad [graduate] students, and he says, "You know, I'm angry."  He said, "I have gone through the public school system, I have obtained my first degree, and I'm learning things in this class that I've never heard of before and I am very, very angry.  We need to do something about our school system."  He said, "The only thing I ever heard about Civil Rights Movement was negative.  I just never heard the things that I'm learning in this class," one example.  Another one, we were right in the midst of a class one day and this guy jumped straight up in his seat and said, "You know something?  I know what Ms. [HistoryMaker Victoria] Adams and Dr. Gray want, they intend for us to do something."  (Laughter) He said, "They really intend for us to do something."  And I said, "Yeah, I'm glad you said that; that's right."  So finally, we're doing an evaluation coming toward the end of the, the semester and this young man--I was asking what was gonna be different in their lives as a result of having taken part in this class.  He said, "Well, I was gonna be a history teacher when I came here."  He said, "I'm still gonna be a history teacher," he said, "but I'm going to be a teacher of authentic history."  (snapping) Got it.  Yes, it was very exciting.
Story_ID: 196816
Speaker 1: Ms. [HistoryMaker Victoria] Adams, when you look back over your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: That would be very, very hard to, to respond to, in terms of an event or anything of the sort, but I think that one of the things that in reflecting upon my life is that if one truly surrenders your life to a higher being, you'll never get bored.  You'll find lots of surprises, lots of challenges which you'll never regret following the spirit.  My signature song is, 'I'm Gonna Do What the Spirit Says to Do' [sic. 'I'm Gonna Do What the Spirit Says Do'].
Speaker 1: And how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: How would I like to be remembered?  You know, the, the event that I was telling you about where my town--my hometown celebrated my, my work?  One of the things that occurred to me as the, as the day started to come to an end was I'm not really worried about my feelings.  It doesn't matter what they say, I'm just--I'm gonna go--when it's time to go, I'm going to sleep and it's gonna be okay because at this particular moment in my life, I have no regrets.  I have given what I had to give.  I have received so much more than I have given in that process, that I could never ever regret the journey.  And as Ms. [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou would say--what does she say?  "Wouldn't take nothing from my journey now."
Story_ID: 196817
Speaker 1: That is my paternal grandparents, Conteen and Frozene McCollum Jackson.
Speaker 2: Could you just spell their names really quickly?
Speaker 1: C-O-N-T-E-E-N; Conteen.  F-R-O-Z-E-N-E; Frozene.  McCullum, M-c-C-U-L-L-U-M.  Jackson, J-A-C-K-S-O-N.
Speaker 2: You think it was taken around the 1940s?
Speaker 1: I would say more the '30s [1930s] than the '40s [1940s] as I--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, 1930.
Speaker 1: Yeah, as we think about that.  That, that, that is a picture that was made during the high school graduation celebration of our longest--youngest son, Reuben Ernest Adams, III, who is wearing the white suit.
Speaker 2: And about what year?
Speaker 1: That was 1985.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Petersburg High [School, Petersburg, Virginia].  That is a picture of the MF--some--you might say MFDP [Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party] hierarchy, or some of us.  From right to left, yours truly; next is Annie [Bell Robinson] Devine; next is Arthur Cannoy, one of the greatest constitutional lawyers this country has ever seen; along with [William] Kunstler, [Morton] Stavis and the other folk, I--I'm sorry, I can't identify them.
Speaker 2: About what year was this?
Speaker 1: That was probably, early to mid-'80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: We were receiving awards, at that time.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That is a picture--I believe my husband was receiving his final promotion to Sergeant Major at Fort Lee--I'm sorry, Fort Myer, Virginia.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And your husband's name?
Speaker 1: Reuben Ernest Adams, Jr.
Speaker 2: What year was that one taken?
Speaker 1: That was--oh, oh, oh--that was, hmm, that was probably 197--between 1974 and '75 [1975].  To his right is General Ryan [ph.], who at that time was general chief of the--chief of staff of the [U.S.] Army.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And to my right on the picture is the wife of the deceased chief, Mrs. Abrams [ph.]; and her right is the wife of Joe Ryan [ph.], who is present there.  That is a picture of my maternal grandmother [Pinky Ott (ph.)] and grandfather [Thomas Ott, Jr. (ph.)], my mother [Annie Mae Ott Jackson] and her siblings.
Speaker 2: This is your mother here, right?
Speaker 1: That's my mother.
Speaker 2: And what's your mother's name?
Speaker 1: Annie Mae Ott.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I need to look at that a little bit closer.
Speaker 2: This was New Jersey.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the New Jersey one.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Please tell us the date on that one.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was probably--what is this, 2004?  That was probably two--between 2002 and 2003.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: State of New Jersey.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The General Assembly [New Jersey Legislature].
Speaker 2: Okay, 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That was me when I was serving as president of the wives club at--1978, that would be at Fort Lee [Virginia].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 196818
Speaker 1: That was probably, early to mid-'80s [1980s] where the beloved community, which we refer to the movement community, was beginning to come back together after twenty years in disarray.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a story within itself.  Again, [HistoryMaker] Victoria Jackson Gray Adams and Annie [Bell Robinson] Devine.
Speaker 2: About what year was that one taken?
Speaker 1: Oh, mercy, probably mid to late '80s [1980s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Hmm, don't have a clue.
Speaker 2: Maybe like 1990s maybe?
Speaker 1: Yeah, that, that, that sounds good.  That hat would probably--
Speaker 2: This one is from your sixty-fifth birthday.
Speaker 1: Okay.  My sixty0fifth birthday, I know that because it says so on the balloon.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And so what year was that?  What year were you born again?
Speaker 1: Sixty-fifth birthday, must've been what, '91 [1991]?
Speaker 2: Okay, 1991, that's what we'll go with.
Speaker 1: Presumably.  That is the day of my wedding to Reuben E. Adams, Jr.
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-six [1966]?
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-six [1966], February 20th, Washington D.C.  That's the three of us at home in Thailand, Bangkok.
Speaker 2: Okay.  What year?  Sixty-eight [1968]?
Speaker 1: More like '69 [1969].
Speaker 2: Sixty-nine [1969]?  Okay.  This one says '57 [1957] on it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that--I'm, I'm about to--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry, Mrs. Gray--Mrs. Adams--
Speaker 1: I'm about to board a flight--
Speaker 2: I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: --which in those days was kind of unheard of in the black community where I come from.  About to board the airplane for Washington D.C. to--for a gathering of the business community of my company.
Speaker 2: Who's the other person in the photograph?
Speaker 1: That is my uncle, Charlie Knights.
Speaker 2: Okay.  And about what year?
Speaker 1: It tells, 1957.
Speaker 2: Nineteen fifty-seven [1957], okay.
Speaker 1: That is my father, Mack Jackson, and I don't see mom [Annie Mae Ott Jackson] on the thing here.
Speaker 2: Oh, about what year was that?
Speaker 1: Ooh.
Speaker 2: What would be your best guess?
Speaker 1: Early '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 1: Mom's is probably earlier than that, but I can't there guess, but I'll say early '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I was seven-years-old when mom and dad got married.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So about what year do you think that one was taken?
Speaker 1: Like I said, early '30s [1930s].
Speaker 2: Early '30s [1930s]?  I'm sorry.  Okay.
Speaker 1: That's a, that's a wild guess.
Speaker 2: Okay, that's fine.
Speaker 1: The top picture is of yours truly when I lived in Frankfurt, Germany.  That was in the early '50s [1950s].  And I'm look--I'm leaning out of the window of--in my dining room.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And that, that picture is likewise in Frankfurt, Germany, and in that picture is the hus--the father of my oldest children, Tony West Gray, Sr., myself, my oldest child and only daughter, Georgie, and my oldest son, Tony, Jr.  And those are friends of ours who are visiting with us there in Frankfurt.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Buddy and me, which is what I call my husband, Reuben Ernest Adams, Jr.
Speaker 2: Okay.  About what year was that one taken?
