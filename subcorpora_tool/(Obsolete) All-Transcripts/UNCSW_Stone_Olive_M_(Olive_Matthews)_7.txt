Chapel HH, NC 2759Q..3926  - _:c -=  This is the final interview with Olive Stone conducted by Sberna  Gluck of the Feminist History Research Project, in conjunction with the  Southern Oral History Program. In this interview we cover Olive Stone's  last years in the east and her move to California, the years at UCLA and  current activities in community affairs, particularly relating to gerontology.  This interview essentially covers those year.s following her commitment to  the southern reform causes, after leaving William and Mary. Most of the  commitment to these causes was primarily in terms of financial support, and  her primary organizational talents were directed more towards professional  organizations &#8226;  Sherna Gluck: You left Valdosta, then in &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  Olive Stone: In the spring of my second year there 1944. I 1Dok a  leave of absence to go to Washington, look the situation over, and see if I  wanted to move. I had been surveying the possibility of ta.king that double  deanship, you know, but before deciding, I wanted to go back, see "Jock"  (John) and size up the meshing of personal and career concerns.  SG: So he was still alive at that point?  Stone: Oh yes; he didn't die until just before I came out here.  SG: Did you have any idea of what it was you wanted to look for in  Washington?  Stone: Yes; I had great respect for the federal government's  welfare programs, predecessors of HEW--my earliest social work employer, the  Children's Bureau, which was started long ago under Theodore Roosevelt with  Julia Lathrop, and then Grace Abbott and Katherine Lenroot and so on. So I  knew about that for a long time. Then during the Depression there had been  the widespread relief program caJ.led FERA and then the Bureau of Public  Assistance; which was lodged in the Social Security Administration with the  Children's Bureau and the Vocational. Rehabilitation Bureau.  SG: Now this would ha.ve meant to move out of academia. for you,  which would have been the first time in &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  2  Stone: And they were wary of me; some of the professional employees  thought I would be too theoreticaJ., too academic.  I was a training consultant, had fourteen states to which I ga.ve  consultations, upon their invitation. The invitations caine through regional  offices in the 10 regions of the U.S. Government--which still hold. You  know, one of the head.quarters is in San Francisco. I had New England &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  SG: So you traveled around the country, in other words.  Stone: Only in three regions, fourteen states. In New England, a.ll  six of those states among them invited me every season, bless their hearts;  and I love New England [laughter] in the spring, in the fa.ll, in the summer  and the winter [la.ughter]--though I nearly froze sometimes in the winter.  But they did invite me for consultations, a.nd frequently from there I  managed to take my annual leave (which you could arrange almost anytime if'  it didn't conflict with other matters)o I would save up and ta.ke some  vacation trips from Vermont up to Canad.a., or from Massachusetts out to  Martha's Vineyard and so on.  SG: Now you were training people in a specific agency, then?  Stone: Yes. The state agencies had public assistance bureaus. The  Child Welfare Department was not in my province, because the Children's  Bureau remained aloof from us; it was older, and tended to recruit bettertrained  social workers to state a.nd local positions. Their job descriptions  required at least one yea:r of graduate study, and most incumbents had two  years, that is, a Master's degree. And we in public assistance did well to  get college graduates. And in West Virginia I asked them what their  requirements were (I was looking at their provisions), and one person said,  3  "Well, we try to see that the body is warm." [laughter] And actually at  one point in West Virginia &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; I was glad I went there early in my career,  because I thought I was teaching with very simple English. I would sey in  New England, "If you don't understand my Alabama accent, speak up," but I  didn't think they'd misunderstand my language content, because I didn't use  fancy words at all. But in West Virginia I was laying out the plan for the  workshop we were going to have, and after a brief time one member of the  group (who wa.s not a high school graduate) said, "Well, I think you're a  very nice woman, but I haven't understood a word you said." So I swall.owed  ha.rd [laughter) and went to the blackboard a.nd drew some things so that we  could understand relationships between workers and clients, and workers and  supervisors and so on and so forth.  SG: You were actually training the line workers directly, rather  than the supervisors?  Stone: Well, the supervisors I had separately in a meeting, and then  they were always present with the workers. I didn't always like that,  because I thought it would put a damper, perhaps, on the workers to have  them speak out freely with the supervisors present. But most of the time  we had to make that compromise [laughter) so that the supervisors wouldn't  feel tmeasy about it. And sometimes the chief of the whole state agency  would come in and have something to say. For instance, in Maine we originally  had a splendid M.D. who was the head of the Maine Department of Health and  Welfare. He was an awfully nice man. But the economizing group got in  power in Maine, and they thought the place to cut (as they usually do) was  financial assistance to welfare recipients: "You're spending too much on  them. You 're being too soft-hearted." So this businessman was elected--or  4  appointed, I don't recall whether it was an appointive office or not. But  at any rate he was the head of the State Department, a man with sort of a  baJ..d spot on his--! remember him well. And he wanted to come to my  meetings. So we asked him, if he didn't mind, to sit in the rear of the  room so that the staff wouldn't be too conscious of his presence. And every  now and then I could see his bald head rising [laughter] &#8226; He was trying to  stew down and knowing he had to get up. But he managed pretty well.  But to go back, yes I did hold workshops. Sometimes I was invited  to speak at the state conference, which was a huge organization, in  Massachusetts, Kentucky and several other states. Sometimes I established  other community relationships. But ma.inly I went to the regional office,  a.nd from there, a..t'ter being briefed on things that had happened in the  state to which I was to give some consultation, I would go out to that  state (its capitol) and talk with the Chief of Public Assistance. There  would be staffs in most of those areas, rather large. Massachusetts, for  instance, still had an Overseer of the Poor in each township, believe it  or not--the same admjnistration of poor relief that prevailed in colonial  times. And my report back to the national headquarters was entitled "In  the Shadow of Colonial Times," although there were some progressive policies.  Maine, in contrast, had not organized for welfare until a later period when  you didn't have to use horses and buggies (laughter] to get places, and you  could have much larger geographic units. So they had districts, and never  counties or townships.  SG: Now, when you would go on these consulting trips, would you be  going alone, or were there a team of you that would go?  5  Stone: No, I'd go alone from Washington but regional representatives  accompanied me to States. Well, occasionally my invitation would coincide  with that of someone from Personnel Management Division or some other  division. Sometimes we would have a Child Welfare specialist there at the  same time. But we us ua..11&#165; didn't go as teams &#8226;  SG: For the whole five years your job was as training consultant?  Stone: Yeso Well, to begin with there was not a vacancy there, and  I worked in the technical. program that prepared examinations to select  public welfare people. This was for a brief period, and then a vacancy  occurred. Most of the time .I was within the "technical training division. 11  We called the people in state offices mainly "staff development personnel,"  but the la.st I heard they were still calling the Washington D.C. office the  Department of Technical Training within the Bureau of Public Assistance.  Now the Bureau has had several other names since then.  SG: Did it remain the Bureau of Public Assistance a.11 through your  stay?  Stone: Through my st~; and under Social. Security before HEW was  organized.  SG: Now, during that five years, then, you did not do any teaching  at universities at a.11?  Stone: Except that I taught an evening course at Howard U. , gave an  occasional lecture at u. of Md. where my friend Harold Hof'fsommer had come  from LSU and once at George Washington University. I wa.s o:f'ten a guest at  colleges on my consultations.  When the famous sociologist, E. Franklin Frazier of Howard asked me  to fill in for a younger professor who had gone to war, I found it fascinating  to see the contra.st between the black students who came from the South  and those who came from Pennsylvania a.nd New York. The ones educated in  nonsegregate:l schools of the North and East ran circles around the others.  SG: Were you one of the few white faculty?  Stone: One of the few. They had other white faculty. I found I  6  learned a lot from that university experience.  Frazier--he was busy writing books [laughter] &#8226;  I didn't see very much of  I did see him from time to  time, and he joined a group of us in Washington who were interested in a.n  interracial approach. I don't think we called it the Southern Committee  for People's Rights, but we may have. It met around &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; met at my house  and Dr. and Mrs. CaJJ.is, friends from Tuskegee contacts were among my  personal as well as professional friends. You had to be careful, by the  wey-; some people in southern-oriented Washington had prejudices. They  would call the government if they found out that I was having black people  come to my apartment. I had them to dine with me and visit me anytime, you  know.  SG: They would call and what?  stone: The critics would ca.1.1. For instance, I was looking for an  apartment and the manager had to get ref er enc es from me. They knew I was  with the government, so they'd ca.11 the Bureau and sa;y, "I don't like what  that woman is doing to our race relations. She's willing to ll ve in a &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  She asks if we would take Negroes in apartment buildings." I seemed to  alwa;ys put in a plug to find out what was there. I didn't ma.ke any big issue  but wanted to know if Negroes were welcome.  I was sitting in the chief's office one time when the phone rang.  He said, "Yes, thank you very much. Yes, that's vecy gracious of you. I'm  glad to have your ide~." He turned to me and said, "Apparently somebody  7  doesn't like to know we have staff members who would mix with Negroes."  SG: In other words, they would caJ.l where you worked to report.  Stone: Yes, report that; but didn't take any further action on. it,  you know. In my building, the apartment building in which I had an apartment,  there were several entra.nces--one didn't have to go through the lobby.  I was on the second floor; I went to the lobby only to get my mail (the  boxes were down there). But I parked on Ashmead, a.nd the front entrance  was below that on Belmont. So I told my friends, for the most part, where  to enter on the Ashmead side, pa.st the drugstore a.nd right on to my apartment  on that level. It was the ground floor on Ashmead, but second floor  in the building. And there were five hundred apartments in the building,  so, you know, people didn't pay too much attention.  But I was going to say, I remember that E. Franklin Frazier was there  one night, and I had a bowl of' fruit in the center. He picked up some  bananas (which were very scarce at that time) and said, "Strange fruit;"  do you remember the novel? [laughter] He was witty and attractive. But I  taught at Howard. Now among the things that I learned from Howard were  first, that there was a great contra.st between the southern educated and the  northern educated Negroes; and second, that they had race prejudice. This  astonished me although it shouldn't have. 'Black is beautiful." had not  arrived.  SG: The northerners?  Stone: No. Well, the Howard University students. The lighter,  mul.atto ones were accepted for the fraternities, and the darker ones were  not. And in many of the best families, you know, you have a variation.  Brothers might be accepted if' there was a good mulatto brother there. So  8  they had their color and class prejudices.  SG: Well, was that a class thing, though? Because the middle and  upper class went to great pa.ins to look whiter.  Stone: Yes, it was, partly. And they tended to be mixed (but they  weren't necessarily, of course). I just got some impressions, and later  somebody did some research and reported on it, so that Howard had to look  to its own [laughter] problems &#8226; But that was a class thing.  SG: How did you feel there?  Stone: And, you know, class is so difficult to mention in America.  In England they acknowledge there are these class differences" It is very  ha.rd to pin class down, except through income and education statistics.  And people when asked to classify themselves as upper, middle, or lower  class will usua.1.ly select middle no matter how poor especial.ly &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  Now, you asked a question.  SG: How, as a white faculty member, how did you feel that you were  treated by the students? And how did you feel being at the school as one  of the few white faculty members'l We're talking about the early to midforties,  now.  Stone: At exam. time I had a very large section (forty or so) and I  had to give multiple choice questions (one essay maybe). But there was a  good deal, a certain amount of cheating by the people who had had poor  backgrounds. So I gave out the questions by dividing them up and having  them start at different places; you see, I'd have four or five pages, three  or four pages, and I'd order them differently so that they woo.ld have to  stick to tha r own. And I think they felt that if they didn't get a good  grade, that it was probably the white woman's fault. I don't know, I didn't  have that sa.id.  j  9  I was treated splendidly by the faculty. And I served on many committees  in the School of Social Work although I didn't tea.ch a course over  there. I had a white friend who was teaching there, two white friends in  fa.ct who were teaching at the School of Social. Work, and there races were  more accustomed to working with each other; even in the deep South we never  had separate associations of social workers--the two races a.l.W8&#165;S met  together whereas the doctors, the M.D. 's had separate organizations. There  was a. Negro Medical Association and a general Medical Association.  SG: How about, for instance, the sociologists?  Stone: No, we always met together. But we couldn't meet in all  cities. Atlanta was our favorite place [lauahter], because we could always  meet together there. Though, as far as I can recall, the Negroes didn't  stey at the hotel. We had meetings in the hotel, and the meetings were  open (I mean, there were both races there). And we served refreshments,  things like that, and I think we may have had luncheons and dinners; but  I 'm sure the black delegates had their rooms at the university. Atlanta  University is a large and famous black university, and I think they st"7'ed  there.  SG: When you were in Washington, this group that you talked about  (when E. Franklin Fra.z ier joined you on one occasion) , was this a group tba;  met fairzy regularly?  Stone: Well now, I'm trying to recall that. The Fra.ziers a.nd  Cal1ises were personal friends so it may have been purely social. However  we did share professional interests so it may have had a social policy  purpose. Ralph Bunche was still in Washington but had moved to the Department  of State from Howard and had become more conservative.  10  SG: Did you maintain your identification with southern groups during  that period in Washington, either with other individuals who were from the  deeper South, or in the Southern Sociological Association and those civic  southern ties?  Stone: On yeso A stream of southm':e.'"s in connection with war  activities or professional matters stopped by. There was a D.C. Sociological  Society and a Southern Sociological. I didn't sever ray membership with the  Southern Sociological until after I'd been in California some time. And  several leaders there urged me to continue my affiliation.  SG: So during that Washington period you still kept a lot of the &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  Stone: Southern ties.  SG: &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; southern ties you had developed.  Stone: Yes. However except for relatives and old home-town friends,  I did not cultivate or retain relationships with people who were prejudiced.  I just didn't see that I had time to cope with that [laughter] on a personal.  basis. I needed to have congenial friends, my personal friends and associates--  who were not identical-minded, but at lea.st liberal-minded.  SG: So you don't recall a group of more liberal southerners who were  engaged in activities together during those Washington yea:rs, then?  Stone: Yes, some old and some new. My trips to states in my three  regions took me out of the city a great deal. Hence ray civil rights  activities were largely within the social work associations.  There were old ties too. Virginia and Clifford Durr lived in the  area. He had an office with the federal government in communications  during the Roosevelt administration. I was there in Truman's, as well.  The Durrs had a Virginia address, and she sta:rted a.n electoral. reform group.  And there continued to be these same groups for peace or for legislative  reform and so on that kept in touch.  11  Now one of the meetings (but I believe that was before I went to  Valdosta) concerned this same man John Davis, who had been head of the  National Recovery Program in the government and held this joint meeting  with Howard University in 1935 that I told you about. He laia' organized an  all-Negro congress, and E. Phillip Randolph wa.s the chairman of that. That  was held in 194o.  As best I can tell, the Negro's position a.nd attitude have changed  periodically. There are several periods in which the Negro has withdrawn  to himself because he just is not going to keep on taking the lower seats  at the table with the white people; he '11 go on with his own program. And  Vann Woodard in his marvelous book on Jim Crow s~s, now the Negroes  themselves have gone back to Jim Crow, but it's their choice. He thought it  was a setback that they insisted on the black system.  SG: But during this period it was more of a tangential relationship,  though, to the &#8226; &#8226; &#8226;  Stone: Yes. Most of the things I wanted to do I did through the  national. bodies of either social work or sociology. I was local legislative  chairman once a.nd I was also on the national panel on "Social Policy  and Legislation." That usua.lly met in Washington because we wanted to hea.r  from the lobbyists. We had one woman hired who gave her full time to  lobbying for social work legislation in Washington. Wickenden was her  name. (She was the daughter of a college president and wi:fe of "Tex"  Goldschmidt who wrote The South: The Nation's Economic Problem Number One.  He was with the federal government and later he went with the United Nations,  l2  where he still is o ) ''Wickie, " as we called her, was representative of the  American Public Welfare Association. So the national policy and legislative  committees usua.lly convened in Washington, and had members from aJ.1 over  the United States.  SG: So this was much broader, then, than the issue of civil rights  areas?  Stone: Oh yes. Well, they were broader, but in a way the big problems  in social work have always been to protect, as the civil rights people  do, the ethnic minorities and the poor. And the poor are the ones who are  discriminated against all the time, and who all too readily accept blame  for their deprivations, believing that maybe they did something wrong or it  was their fault that they lost their job. Or they may have guilt about not  having enough money and so on. And so they turn to conservative religions  as solace.  SG: Well Olive, it was during this Washington period that this  whole issue came up of the investigation into the Southern Conference for  Human Welfare.  Stone: Yes, the McCarthy smears did appear during that period.  SG: Now you were just routinely being checked as a government  employee; was that it?  Stone: It was when Truman ca.me in; of course, Truman did a lot of  wonderful. things. But the "list" I didn't think was a. good thing; he could  have stood up against McCarthy well, at lea.st I thought so at the time.  (But he can be credited with a lot of very fine things, I think, such as  iJmnediately recognizing the state of Israel. .I always value that. I don't  know how you feel, but I feel it deserves to be a state and to stay there.  1.3  And he did recognize it at once.) And he's done a lot of things &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  recognizing the "buck stops here" and talking forthrightly a.bout the issues  that he feels the president is responsible for instead of dodging them.  But he did accede to the McCarthy travesties. And I, as I think I told you,  rather foolishly 1.isted the Southern Conference for Human Welf'are though I  was never really very active in it. But I just felt you should stand up  for it [laughter]. And they investigated me. I didn't know it directly,  except that friends would say that investigators had been in Alabama. a.nd  they hoped I hadn't gotten into any trouble, that they were interviewed by  the FBI, and so on.  SG: In other words, you had to sign a loyalty oath, and since it  was listed on the Attorney General's list, you indicated that you had been  involved. Was that specifically for that?  Stone: They asked us to fill out a form listing all the organizations;  and I think I must have had a little devilish thought when I listed the DAR's  and the ~ 's and the Southern Conference for Human Welfare [laughter] &#8226;  To go back to the investigations, it was not felt by me in any  special way, except that du.ring the McCarthy period someone would every now  a.nd then in the Bureau or in the social security building, say, "Remember  the Hatch Act." Well, the Hatch Act was only against partisan politics; it  didn't say you couldn't propose legislation. It just said it must be nonpartisan,  and you can't support candidates. And I don't know but what it's  a. pretty good thing (not to get out, if yorlre a government employee, and  actively support a candidate). I don't know. Since my retirement from  UCIA I have supported candidates [laughter] actively. I worked for McGovern,  dear soul [laughter]; he didn't win, but &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; Has the Hatch Act been  abolished? I think it has.  14  SG: I think it has. I lmow th ere was a state Hatch Act too; I  recall in California the layalty oath was alive in 1959 when I was first a.t  Berkeley.  Stone: Oh yes. Some people took the loyalty oath; some refused to  a.nd went to other universities to teach, until they came back a.nd were reinstated  (and back pay, I think, was pa.id).  00: Yes. I think it was. Just recently, I think, was the ruling  on Eason Monro.e* on back pay; and I don't know what happened with John  Caughey.*  Stone: I don't either for sure, a.bout the back pay-. He didn't  teach elsewhere. A friend of mine at Berkeley went to MIT and taught.  SG: Well now, you were at UCLA, in fact, during the loyalty oath  fights here, weredt you?  Stone: Yes. Yes, I was.  SG: I wanted to ask you about it. Before we leave Washington,  though, what I wanted to ask was: it was a very different kind of life for  you, wasn't it, a.f'ter having been tied for so many yea.rs to college communities?  How did you feel about that! Did you enjoy this new kind of  life, or did you miss the campus?  Stone: Richmond had prepared me in part; it didn't have the kind of  campus &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; It was a downtown ty:pe of institution and though it had a  nwnber of buildings and some of them housed students. And some faculty  rented apartments in one building. It wa.s more like Pittsburgh, in which  you pass people or fail to see them because you are going up one elevator  while they are coming down the other. So we didn't have that kind of campus,  *Both faculty members in the u.c. system who refused to sign the California  loyalty oath in the 1950's.  l  15  and we had much mixing in the community. And social workers do have,  alwa\Y'S have, teachers from other professions (psychiatrists, other M.D.'s,  psychologists, lawyers and others) to come in and teach some of the  thoeries on growth and behavior. So I was already prepared for the absence  of a campus and for nonacademic colleagues. The fact was that in Washington  we had a large building and our Bureau did have a great many meetings with  other social workers and other professors, both in our building and in  the communityo  The Washington work though was with highly educated professional  people who were employed in these jobs. Ewan Clague, for instance, who was  head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics used to be a university professor  (has his Ph.D. in economics); Karl de Schweinitz was there before he came  out to UCLA and many of the people in the Bureaus were people with the same  general intellectual interests that I had had elsewhere. It was different  in several. ways though. One was that I had to try to be less theoretical  on field trips and I was complimented on r.rry success at the time I was  leaving; several people said, "I voted against your [laughter] coming because  I thought you'd be too academic. But I must tell you that you haven't been  and you worked with us a.11 right." But even here in Santa Monica when I've  tried to work in the community in gerontology, every now and then somebody  has to tell me, "Olive, you're getting technical" or will quip, "What did  you say, teacher?" It's ha.rd to lose. But I was a..1.wa.ys in the training  division in Washington, so that in that respect, I kept on teaching.  SG: So you had the transition, really, in Richmond.  Stone: Richmond, and then in Washington it was not all that different.  But when I went to other places I nearly always met university people,  16  especia.lly if we were in com.unities that had colleges. For instance in  Boston, I didn't go to Harward--they didn't have a School of Social Work  [laughter) --but I did go to Boston College, Simmons College and Boston  University; and they asked me to speak at classes there sometimes, or their  deans or their faculty members would be on committees in the social work  connn.uni ty, you see. So that you' re not entirely away from academia [laughter) &#8226;  SG: Now what led to your decision to leave the government and come  out to UCLA, then?  Stone: Well, partly the death of Jock from his final hea.rt attack.  At first I was a.:f'raid I might be running away from instead of working through  the trauma not only of his death but of the prolonged anxiety preceding the  loss. But UCIA was starting a new School of Social Work, and if there's  anything I like [laughter], it's a pioneer job, initiating something that  hasn't been done and that you can try to have a share in organizing. Donald  Howard had been, at the time he was invited out here, :president of the  American Association of Social Workers, and was a researcher at Russell  Sage Foundation. He knew the de Schweinitzs and when Howard came down to  Washington he met me at their house. They had suggested that he try to  hire me. We talked, a.nd I didn't know whether I wanted to come all the way  across the continent [laughter] and so forth. But in the end changes do  occur, and you can't just stay and try to relive your life. So I pulled up  stakes and decided to come out here.  My sister joined me in Glacier National Park and we had some vacation  along the wa;y. She helped me find my first apartment here, and buy my  furniture for it and get settled. And that was nice to have family with me  for a.while. The early days of the school were a little rugged, because  17  what Don did was to gather up five Ph.D.'s, and not necessarily the best  caseworkers, (laughter] in the basic courses, so I had to organize the  field work and do some other things . And we gradually got people who were  accepted in: the community for their methodology. We still had town a.nd  gown conflict in social work. What I read il the journals of social. work  and here at UCLA from time to time is that the agencies in which we place  our students for practice would like for us to put less emphasis on how to  think and decide and to reason things out, and more on how to ~ and do  now, you know. And the academic world doesn't believe in the latter; we  feel that we'd rather students would be a little fumbling at first, but  learn to do their own thinking and so on. So there's still a little bit of  a conflict between town and gown in that respect. But we have some of our  own placements within branches of the university: such as its hospitals,  its clinics, its Neuropsychiatric Institute, its university elementary  school. So that a good many of our placements are in academic settings  that understand our approach.  SG: Now wasn't there quite a division, and possibly even conflict,  between the School of Social Work and the Department of Sociology when you  first came?  Stone: There was in Chicago; I think I mey have mentioned that they  had.  SG: Yes, you talked about that.  Stone: Well, here they had to pass on me because my Ph.D. was in  sociology and not in social work. I was not as proper a sociologist as  some other people were. But they did pass on me to enter as a.n associate  professor; I'd been a fu.11 professor at Richmond.  SG: Oh, I see; you didn't come here as a full professor?  18  Stone: I didn't come here as a full professor. And I wouldn't come  for less than an associate; it was a higher salary than I ha.cl gotten before,  and that part was a.11 right. But, you see, it's "publish or perish" here,  and I'd been too busy doing and writing training brochures. At the time I  was with Washingtcn I wrote a great many of their materials, but they had  to go out under the title of the department or bureau with the name of the  Chief, Jane Hoey&#183;-she didn't write any of it but she symbolized the agency.  HEW has abolished that rule now, I'm glad to say, and lets people get credit  for their own writing.  SG: Now Olive, during your UCLA years, when you first came there  weren't very many women who were even associate professors, were there?  Stone: That 's true.  SG: Didn't Rosalind Cassidy come as the first woman full professor  at UCIA?  Stone: Yes she did. She had a good many publications, and she came  from Mills College. Had she been a dean?  SG: Yes.  Stone: I think she had held an a.dministrati ve post. And I do think  that it's more likely to happen for women in the higher ranks, associate  and full professor, in nursing, social work and physical education for  women.  SG: The traditional women's &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  Stone: The traditional areas for women, you see. And, for awhile,  home economics. But that was abolished on this campus &#8226; And the people who  were food experts went over to public health.  SG: Were there several women on the faculty when the school began  here?  19  Stone: Yes, there were three of us who were Ph.D.'s. (I don't know  why I'm mentioning this; it's taken for granted in universities [laughter).  Except we don't have that many Ph.D.'s in social work.) Marjorie Drury,  who came from psychology into the school and taught community organization;  Helen Witmer, who came out here from the Children's Bureau to teach research  and then returned; she was never rea.lly anchored here. She had a home in  Alexandria; had a brother there and family. She was asked to be the chief  of research for the White House Conference on Children that was held in  1950. You see, she came in 1949 with me. She and Marjorie Drury and I  were the first three people hired by Don Howard. Didn't have a full-time  ma.le member except the Dean.  SG: Were all three of you at the level of associates?  Stone: Marjorie and I were associate professors. Helen was, I  think, a full professor because she had many publications.  SG: Now when, then, were you made full professor?  Stone: Not at the time of my eligibility because I requested  deferral [laughter]. Y01 see, at the end of six years you can be up for  promotion, but I wanted to use my sabbatical to write and asked postponement.  SG: So that would have only been since about 195? &#8226;&#8226;&#8226;&#8226;  Stone: Yes not until I considered my publications adequate. There  haven't been very many women. I noticed that Jeanne Giova.nonni&#183; wa.s. recently  made a full professor. She's a young person at the School of Social Work,  but she's written some very good books. Children of the Storm is about  minorities in the child welfare field. The women seem to stS&#165; at the  assistant :professor level while they're young (laughter].  SG: During those UCLA years, what was the focus of your activity,  20  both professionaJ.ly and in terms of your community work and political-type  work?  Stone: I continued to be active in legislative matters, and to go  to national and international meetings, usually the international meetings  I attended were he1d on our continent. But I was active in the Council of  Social Work Education. I' afraid my main thrust has been in trying to  develop a generic approach to the methodology and to gain acceptance of its  validity, and my publications have been in that field; that is, giving  students the theoretical background for using "integrated methods" instead  of separate methods. But now a:rter a period of popularity some schools are  reverting to the separate methods of group work, casework and community  organization.  SG: So your effort was to try and make the distinctions between  these?  Stone: No, on the contrary to encourage what medicine would ca.11  "generalists" rather than 3 kinds of "specialists." Social work like  medicine needs more general. practitioners with ability to use whichever  method or methods the problem calls for"  SG: Did you stick with the marriage and family commitment and stuff  that you had developed?  Stone: Not after Chapel Hill and William and Ma.ry, plus those other  universities when I was substituting for the Groves, as I told you, a.t  Kentucky and Wisconsin.  SG: Right. So a.t'ter you left the East, then &#8226; &#8226; &#8226; ?  Stone: Af'ter I left the Ea.st I never did teach that per se.  Occasionally I was in sociological meetings in which I joined the section  21  on family life; but I soon found that I liked other fields of sociology  somewhat better. For several years I was official liaison between the  .American Sociological Association and the National Association of Social  Workers, as I have said. To prepare these reports I needed to make broad  observations.  SG: And what in terms of your political activities? Were they more  tied to campus kinds of concerns, since there was the loyalty oath? You  came to UCLA right about the time it was a very hot issue.  Stone: I didn't know about the issue. Having signed such a statement  in Washington, I went ahead and signed it here; and afterwards wondered,  you know. On the other hand, I had come to tea.ch, and if I immediately said  I won't teach and if I'd le:rt, what good could I do? So I was a little torn  over that. But I did contribute to a. fund for fellow professors who took  the civil rights stand.  SG: Now by that time had some of them already been fired?  Stone: Not fired but temporarily kept in inactive status pending  adjudication of the legality of the Loyalty Oath. I remember that John  Caughey spoke at academic senate. I didn't know him very well at that  time. Some members of our new social work faculty felt that we should take  a stand and withdraw from the University a.s a total faculty, believing that  this kind of action would make the Board of Regents change its opinion.  But others felt that it was going to take a longer time than that, and  maybe we'd better work within the situation, expressing disapproval of it  and doing what we could from that side. A person like John Caughey couldn't  do that; his conscience wouldn't let him. He was saying, "I can't have the  plea that I'm a Quaker. I'm a. Presbyterian, a.nd we don't necessarily, as  such, go against loyalty oaths or wars or things of this kind.  22  But " he '  said, "I just believe this requirement violates my civil rights." And he  is a very gentle-talking person; do you know him?  00: Yes. So you were just on the margins of this?  Stone: On campus-wide action, yes . We had some things that  developed in the School--a subtle tyranny on the pa.rt of a dominating (some  would sey a castrating) woman who wa.sn 't dismissed before she had devitalized  the majority of the faculty, made them dependent. And by cracky if it  didn't happen with a second female who wa.s controlling but not castrating.  I stood up for some of the younger faculty who were discriminated against  a.nd in time there was a restoration of democratic processes.  On the whole I got a.long very well, and still do, in the university  and in the school as well a.s in the Association of Academic Women of which  I was president one year.  I think there were no special.--oh yes ! The very first thing that  happened when I arrived in the Los Angeles social work connnunity was the  ba.llot issue of Proposition 4 to remove the name of George McLean from a  Consti tutiona.1 Amendment on public welfare. The McLean poli tica.1 forces  had removed old age assistance from civil service and given its direction  to a man with a following and experience in patronage. Against the background  of the Townsend Movement and of Upton Sinclair' s socialist proposals,  it was relatively easy to build a political force--not a ma.chine--before  the general public was aware . The American Association of Social Workers  undertook to set up conferences through which to explore the alternatives.  Dr. Arlien Johnson, a professor from the USC School of Social Work and I  were asked to analyze the issues in a series of public talks. Social  workers on public welfare staffs could not risk their jobs.  23  Proposition 4 was one political issue that the whole social work profession  was involved in for awhile. I can't think of any others &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; except a.t'ter  I retired.  SG: When did you retire?  Stone: In 1964. The governor put in tuition, or the legislature  did. And a large group of people in the community, especially a lot of  Beverly Hills women (rather well-to-do women) didn't like the idea of' a  great university abandoning its traditional standard of low cost and high  standard. So they organized an anti-tuition group called "Citizens for  California Higher Education." I contributed money and time, manning the  headquarters twice a week.  SG: Toward the end of your UCIA years, a.nd right in the period  right after you retired, did you get involved at all in the reemergence of  the civil rights movement in the South?  Stone: Only through financial contributions. My research in Alabama.  in a car with California license plates was handicapped. But there was also  student unrest--protests by minorities. I went up to campus when there were  open meetings ca.lied to explain some of the things that the ethnic groups  wanted. I listened to them and tried to get people from Santa Monica. to  attend.  I'll back up a little bit and say that immediately after my retirement  in 1964 I went to the Veterans' Ad.ministration and worked only three  days a week--they were willing to accept me part-time, and I could continue  with my consultations. I had been paid for giving consultations for several  years, and still respond to occasional requests. But under this arrangement  I could do my writing for a long weekend and work for the VA Monday, Tuesday,  and WednesdS&#165;, three successive days. What I tried to do at the VA was a  24  combination of therapy and research, attempting to get veterans in their  forties and fi:rties out of the domiciliary into the community, a.nd break  down the revolving door process. Then I got cancer, and had to devote  about a yea:r to that. Three hospitalizations &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; completely well now.  Then while I was recuperating I continued nry work with the National  Association of Social Workers. I wa.s Chairman of the Research Section and  usua..1.ly on a social action committee, that is, social policy and social  action. I liked to get the basis of what the action would be so that we  could tie it into economic conditions. Then I went up to Oregon, you know,  for two yea.rs as a visiting professor.  SG: Oh no, I didn't know that. When?  Stone: Sixty-seven to sixty-nine. And I sold my house when I  couldn't rent it. I had a three bedroom split-level house in Pacific  Palisades in which I'd enjoyed very much entertaining--alweys had my  students, different sections of my classes out there, and my "thirteen  grandchildren on the street," as you've hea:rd me sa:y before. The "grands"  would usua.11.y, when I had a. group of students come, peep in to see if it  was aJ.l right for them to join us; and we said, "Yes, if they wished." And  they didn't; they went awa;s. But I enjoyed that house; had a lot of  personal investment in it--not financial so much as emotional investment.  I had finally found the dream house that I'd (laughter] been wanting a.11  those years. But I sold it because I couldn't rent it successfully. The  house sold easily and I drove a thousand and forty miles to Oregon.  I recaJ.l it was 1,143 including a side trip to Ashland for the  Shakespeare Festival. Before I left, as a result of a psychosomatic reaction  to giving up that house in that neighborhood. and everything, my ankles  25  swelled up so that I cou1dn 't bear my weight on them. And I thought, "Have  I developed diabetes or something all of a sudden?" My sister said,  "Psy~, psychosomatic." And do you know, when I deposited the last  check from the sale of the house in the savings and loan companies, spent  one night at the McMa.nus 's on the fifteenth floor of this building, I  started off next morning without a pain! [laughter] Went straight up  there and had a lovely time for two whole years, with a. young faculty.  SG: And that was at the University of Oregon?  Stone: No, at Portland State University. It was called Portland  State College, and changed to a university while I was there--but I stayed  two yea.rs. So a certain amount of that ethnic protest started while I was  up there. And I found great pleasure, as I always have, in taking members  of minority groups who come with unpromising academic background and seeing  what I can do to help free them to be as good as they can be. I've bad some  very rewarding experiences. I don't think I did anything more than just  like them [laughter] and want them to do well. I had an American Indian,  two of them, a woman and a man in Portland, several blacks, and some :poor  whites and so on. And just enjoyed very much working with them in smaJ.l  groups and in class and in individual conferences"  But I got back down here a.:t'ter Oregon and some more travel (to the  five continents [laughter] and so on) and found UCIA in quite an uproar.  And I did what I couJ.d. in Sa.nta Monica to get :people to come u:p to UCLA to  meetings and see that the "hippies" weren't that bad. The YWCA, where you  would expect to be received with a.n open mind wouldn't hear of it! "These  :people, it's dreadful!" I guess it was a combination of the long hair and  the four-letter words and the minority assertiveness and so on, that :prevented  connnuni ty leaders from seeing beneath to the youthful ideals and candor.  26  And so I didn't succeed in getting many people in this area. So, for  several years I did work rather largely with my friends at UCLA; continued  with the Emeriti Association (I was on the executive board there), and the  al.unmi who turned to me for various things. It was not until three or four  years ago that I started to be active in the Santa Monica community, in the  community as a whole.  SG: Oh, I see. And after you became involved with the gerontology,  wasn't it?  Stone: Yes. I was first asked if I would do something for R.S.V.P.-that  's the Retired Senior Voltmteer Program. And Mrs. Hult wanted me to  make some demographic studies of--well, she didn't know to call them that,  but some studies of where the old people were. And I got busy and prepared  some demographic maps for talks and workshops. And Extension at UCLA also  called on me, and I compiled a "Sampler on Old Age"--a reader of about two  hundred pages, as background for a course. Extension tried to find a  publisher for me, and I haven't had time to write the introductions to  sections to make it more publishable. But I did select references, organize  them, and give copies to twenty-five men and women aged sixty and over who  were taking the course in research on "Educational Needs of the Elderly of  West Los Angeles and Santa Monica." I was one of their teachers; and then  starting from there I became interested in the gerontological work that was  being carried out in Santa Monica and in the western area under Titles I,  II, III, r:v, V, VI, VII or whatever. [laughter] VII was nutrition, III was  something else. And we set up an Advocate Council in the United Way, and I  was the first chairman of the City Commission on Older Americans which was  established by City Council and subsequently I wa.s elected co-chairman of a  27  County Committee on Aging.. You know the rest, that I've been active in  a number of the old peoples' organizations, giving almost full-time [laughter]  to volunteer work with older people, as chairman or boa.rd member, t~ to  preserve ray pri va.cy which was difficult at times, but easier in this large  building than it might have been otherwise.  People want to talk a.bout problems or how they may be solved; such as  the problem of income (it's the greatest problem, of course) and what may  be done with that; a.nd the question of transportation. When we first  started off we were very pleased to get the bas fa.res down to fi:f'teen cents.  It's now a. dime. It was at first for limited hours (nine to three, I think  it was) and it meant that people started leaving a meeting, even though the  meeting started at 12:30 or l:OO, you see, so a.s to get their bas before  the time ran out. It was a little distracting, and in time the city changed  it altogether. We have another problem with transportation just now that  we 're going to be taking up tomorrow at First Federal Savings and Loan,  because the Transportation Department of the city has a new form that  applicants for this lower fare have to sign, renouncing the right to sue the  bus company for anything that might happen to them under any condition:  boarding, a.lighting or on the bus. And that is discriminatory.  SG: Your work is primarily, basically lobbying, in fa.ct, isn't it  now, or various kinds of measures for &#8226;&#8226;&#8226; ?  Stone: Well, actually not in the sense that the regular lobbyist  does. We discuss these problems, and we have subcommittees on different  aspects such as health, housing, transportation and open meetings on local,  state and national issues. We draw up position papers, write letters, /  sign petitions and attend hearings.  But you wanted to ask about this (holding up a Directory of the  Consortium on Gerontology of USC and UCLA) &#8226; I had tried repeatedly at  28  UCLA to get some department, or a number of departments (I had friends in  economics, public health, etc.) to take a special interest in research on  aging and have their students do so. I got response ma.inly from urban  planning and from public heal th, and we had two groups of students come and  receive guidance from the Santa Monica Commission on Older Americans and  the membership group on Aging.  One of them prepared a housing ordinance for us, which we tried to  get the City Council to adopt. We didn't succeed, but we made a little  headway in enligtening them on some of the conditions, such a.s rising rents  and so on. And the next year (this school year) we were asked to ta.ke two  groups again, one f'rom public health and one from urba.n planning.  SG: In other words, as a member of the Commission you get direct  ca.11s for aid as well as the more complicated issues that are longer-tenn.  projects. You have more immediate needs that have to be met.  Stone: Yes, but we are trying to get the city or the volunteer community  to set up more than information centers. Each of two organizations  has information and referral services. One has a booth on the ma.11, the  other a. larger center over on Ocean Park Boulevard. But we want them to  give service, not just refer a person or let him get the run-around.  We recently had an all-d~ workshop in which we tried to say that the  consumer must find a place, as Harry Truman said, where the buck stops,  where the service is given without further referral. But to return to  university initiative and response, we finally established a Consortium on  Gerontology between UCLA and USC. Meetings have been held alternately on  the two campuses. The "Joint Directory of Research Interests in  29  I'  Gerontology," published in March 1975 is the chief product so far.
