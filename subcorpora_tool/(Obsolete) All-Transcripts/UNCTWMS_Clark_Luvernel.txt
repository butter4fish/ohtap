Joey Fink: It&#8217;s May 14, 2011. I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee, with Luvernal Clark doing an interview with the Southern Oral History Program. This is Joey Fink. Ms. Clark, can you start by telling me when and where you were born?
Luvernal Clark: I was born in Knoxville, Tennessee in a part of the town called Lonsdale.
JF: What&#8217;s Lonsdale like?
LC: It&#8217;s a little different now but back then it was just a small. I mean it was a community of everybody working and families all close together. My grandmother lived across the street from my great-grandmother, and my mom, we lived in the apartments that were down there. We called them the projects back then, but that&#8217;s where we lived. But I stayed a lot with my grandmother when I was young.
JF: Your mom&#8217;s mom?
LC: My mom&#8217;s mom.
JF: So pretty tight family?
LC: Pretty tight family, run to great-grandmamma when we get in trouble.
JF: Uh oh. [Laughs]
LC: [Laughs]
JF: What kind of trouble did you get into?
LC: Kids, kids. See my grandmother had eleven kids, and I was the first grandchild.
JF: Wow.
LC: So I have an aunt that&#8217;s three months older than me and we were like sisters. I was with my grandmamma a lot while my mom and dad worked.
JF: What was the neighborhood like?
LC: A family neighborhood. We had a family neighborhood and a little grocery store, the owner lived in a house in the little grocery store right next door, a candy store, not really a grocery store, a little candy store. She became my godmother, the lady, Miss Mary Thompson. She became my godmother and I got more little special treats than the rest of them. But everybody looked after everybody back then. It was a good life, I mean with chickens, outside toilets; it was just different. [Laughs] But it was the good life, I felt.
JF: What was your school like?
LC: Good school. The school was just right down the street. I went to Sammy Hill Elementary School from first to sixth grade and then went to Beardsley Junior High from the seventh to the ninth. Then I went to&#8212;it was Austin East when I graduated but it was East High, a predominantly white school at that particular time. I graduated a year early and the year I graduated they had merged Austin, which was a predominantly black school, with East and I was in the first graduating class of that school.
JF: Okay and this would have been 19&#8212;?
LC: [19]69.
JF: [10]69? What was that like, the merging?
LC: Well, it was a little different, and that&#8217;s because we moved out of the projects and my parents bought a home on the east side, and it was closer for me to go to that school. I didn&#8217;t have a real bad hard time at that school, I mean after the merger. It went pretty smoothly.
JF: Did you have friends from your neighborhood that were also going to that school?
LC: Yes. We had to walk to school. Well I didn&#8217;t walk to school. My dad took us to school, and I never understood a lot of this because my parents sheltered us a lot. We never knew a lot about racism and stuff like that. I didn&#8217;t know about that because he always took us to school or took us wherever we had to go. I either walked home or they would pick us up, and I never understood that, even riding a bus. I was not allowed to ride the bus until I was almost eighteen years old [Laughs] and when I got on the bus I just sat down. I had heard that black people had to go to the back of the bus, but this was in the [19]60s, and I said, I ain&#8217;t sitting in no back of no bus, so I just sat down. Well I didn&#8217;t understand that and then after I heard it I started reading and hearing about a lot of the history that had happened. And it was over, I mean, you know, so I just sat down, rode the bus. [Laughs] I had no clue at first. I really had no clue. Some people would get up and I thought they was just being polite.
JF: Oh.
LC: I wasn&#8217;t getting up.
JF: [Laughs]
LC: I sat down. I was tired. [Laughs] And it was a joy for us to be able to go downtown. I mean that was a treat for us. My grandfather, he always took me and my auntie, who was the same age. He loved to go downtown. When he&#8217;d have some extra money he&#8217;d buy us something. He&#8217;d sit out there and talk with a group of men and he&#8217;d let us just shop in that one store, and in that store you had skirts, sweaters, shoes; you had everything in there. He&#8217;d let us go get shoes and we&#8217;d come out with a skirt and a sweater and shoes. [Laughs] So I had a pretty good life. I really did. I really did.   I got married when I was eighteen years old and I had my first child that February, and I went to work. I really didn&#8217;t have to work at that particular time but I was always wanting my own money, so I went to work for a non-union factory called Thompson&#8217;s Fishing and Tackle Company, and I mean you were cutting your fingers and everything and they were making you work like dogs and you couldn&#8217;t actually&#8212;. I had a baby and I couldn&#8217;t be off or come home when she was sick. I was blessed a lot because my husband&#8217;s grandmother, she lived to be a hundred years old, and she just took care of my kids for me. But then I thought, I&#8217;m not going back up there. I mean this ain&#8217;t the atmosphere I want to work in. So I came home and I was home for about three months and then I needed a job. My husband and I both did. So we knew a lady named Gloria Garner who goes to my church and she worked at the Knoxville Urban League. She told us that they were going to have to start hiring more blacks at these factories and so she found out that&#8212;it was Jim Robbins Seat Belt Co. at that time&#8212;she found out that they were hiring. They had to hire, it was no ifs, ands and buts, and they had a lot of people in that thing, I think thousands of people, but there was very few minorities. So she helped me get a job and, I never will forget it, it was on the Fourth of July I went down there for an interview and they hired me. The 5th of July was my first day. They wanted me to come to work the next day, no transportation, no nothing [Laughs] because we only had one car. That started my work in 1971 at Jim Robbins Seat Belt Co.
JF: So how did Gloria&#8212;what was her last name?
LC: Garner.
JF: Garner? How do you spell that?
LC: G-a-r-n-e-r.
JF: How did she find you and how did she start talking to you about the factory?
LC: Well we were at church, and she&#8217;s always tried to look after young people at church.
JF: What church did you go to?
LC: First Calvary Baptist Church in Lonsdale, still attend that church. She was trying to get everybody she knew to go and apply for these jobs, come over to the Urban League and apply and then go down there. So she took our applications and I think back then they took them over or talked to them or something.
JF: Had you heard of the Urban League before that?
LC: Well I knew she worked there, yes. I had heard about the Urban League but I had never thought about them helping us get jobs and stuff like that, I mean because it never did occur to me, you know. I thought you went out and got your own job, but I didn&#8217;t know there was actually help for minority people getting jobs.
JF: And what did your husband think about you working?
LC: Well, he was working already, he had found a job, but she helped him get a good job at Robertshaw Controls, and I think it changed to Fulton Bellows, but he worked there thirty-something years, the same as I did. We had decent jobs. We weren&#8217;t in the business of switching. [Laughs] So both of us were pretty [hard] workers, even though I worked six and seven days a week and I don&#8217;t think he did, but we had to work opposite shifts in order to take care of my daughter. His grandmother babysitted for us, that helped us out so much. I don&#8217;t know what I would have done if it wasn&#8217;t for her, because you know the older people, they had these old remedies. I didn&#8217;t get a call at work and say my child was sick. I didn&#8217;t have to go do this because she done it all. I mean that was a blessing to me. He worked there about thirty years before they shut down, shut down because of the union.
JF: What do you mean by that? They&#8217;d rather shut the company down than have it unionize?
LC: Mm hmm, and they lost so much money. He lost weeks of vacation money that has never been recovered. They carried them to court but they claim they didn&#8217;t have no money, but now the company has reopened. It reopened not long after that under a new name, and they hired some of the people back.
JF: Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if we could do that with our credit card debt? I just don&#8217;t have the money to pay it and now my name is Jane Smith&#8212;
LC: I know.
JF: &#8212;and I&#8217;m going to get a new credit card.
LC: And I&#8217;m going to get a new one.
JF: [Laughs] What did your folks think about&#8212;?
LC: My parents were really not [Pause] involved. [Laughs] They didn&#8217;t like the work I did. They were afraid because I was so outspoken. I was kind of quiet at first but getting involved in something where I knew that I could voice my opinion and stuff, they were afraid for me, because they had heard about what people do to some union folks and activists.
JF: What were some of the stories?
LC: The horror stories to them was that they could hurt you, and they were just worried about it. They didn&#8217;t agree with it. But then after awhile, determined me, they came on board, because I told them, I said, I&#8217;m helping you all too, the future generations. I&#8217;ve got to do something for my kids. I&#8217;ve got to do something. And how I really got involved with the union is the first day that I was on the job, or within a few days&#8212;I can&#8217;t remember so good&#8212;they put me on this spring winder machine. Springs is popping out everywhere. There was no safety standards at all. So, they were putting me on this [machine] and I was so afraid and I was about to cry. The union president came over and she asked me, she said&#8212;. She handed me a card. Well, silly me, I&#8217;m young, I don&#8217;t know, [I&#8217;m] new there, and she said, &#8220;Sign this.&#8221;
JF: [Laughs]
LC: Well, I went to writing. [Laughs] I went and signed it. Then she went over to the boss and I mean she chewed him a new butthole and had him to take me off of there, and he took me off and put me on another job to do.
JF: Now had you had any experiences with unions before that?
LC: No, didn&#8217;t even have a clue who the lady was. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs]
LC: I really didn&#8217;t.
JF: What did you think, seeing&#8212;? Was she a white or a black woman?
LC: She was a white, older-like lady. But I&#8217;ve always&#8212;
JF: What did you think, seeing her?
LC: &#8212;had a lot of respect for older people and I thought, well, I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s asking me but my gut feeling was telling me, sign this paper, because the way she said it was like, &#8220;Sign this!&#8221; [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs]
LC: So I did. From then on I had to work your probation and stuff like that, but I didn&#8217;t get really involved until 1982. We had one of the biggest layoffs at that plant that ever was.
JF: And you had been working there about twelve years then?
LC: Yeah. They had moved a lot of stuff out of the plant and we had took a pay cut, and while I was laid off they were supposed to call back in seniority order. They didn&#8217;t call me back when my time came around. When I found out about it I called to find out and&#8212;.
JF: How did you find out about it?
LC: Just workers. I was still in contact with the workers. At that particular time when I got back I was raising sand because by then I had read union books, the contract book. [Laughs] I had read the contract book so I knew that they were going to have to pay me for being out so I filed a grievance. That&#8217;s when I became involved with Mark Pitt.
JF: Who was he?
LC: He was our business agent, and Bruce Raynor. They sat down and they talked to me about getting more involved. Well in that particular time my home life wasn&#8217;t as good as it should have been, I was having issues. They knew that I was kind of like having issues at home, so they wanted me to get involved, I think to get my mind off all that stuff, and that day I got started doing stuff for the union. We had many presidents, I became a union steward first and then working alongside just different ones, and being a union steward I got to sit in on contract negotiations, which was a whole new ballgame for me.
JF: What was that like?
LC: It was like amazing. It was like I&#8217;d never seen or even thought that I had the right to demand anything. [Laughs] But I did. This was like negotiations. It was give and take, give and take, give and take. It was just amazing to me because I was representing, I knew that. I was representing something and somebody, but most of all I was representing myself because I made up in my mind nobody is going to take care of me like me, because a lot of times things would go on and, you know, they kind of looked over it and I got mad.
JF: Can you give me an example of something like that?
LC: I mean like the company had said something or done something wrong and they sort of ignored it. They didn&#8217;t do as well as I thought they would do for me.
JF: The union?
LC: Yes. So I thought, well, I&#8217;ll just have my own voice and speak for myself, which I&#8217;m good at that. I wasn&#8217;t then. I had to learn, and it was a learning process. But I took close attention, then I started going to the union training schools, I started going to the conventions, and the more I learned the more I wanted to help, the more I wanted to do. It was a different life.
JF: Were there things from your background or from your family history that you feel helped you as you were moving into this new role in the union?
LC: Well, I had a strict life and I didn&#8217;t have a voice. I mean my parents were pretty stern, and I&#8217;ve always wanted it&#8212;. It was either, &#8220;Hush! Be quiet!&#8221; do something like that, and I just&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know. I really don&#8217;t know, and then after I found out that it was hard for black people or African American people to get a job I think all of that came to play in the way I wanted to structure my life. I had been a wife and a mother at home and I thought, okay, buddy; it&#8217;s your time to help take care of these kids. You&#8217;ve done what you wanted to all these many years. Now I&#8217;m going to do what I want to. It was a lot of resistance at first from my husband, and I&#8217;ll be honest with you, because he did not like the traveling stuff. He wasn&#8217;t ever used to me being gone.
JF: How long would you be gone at a time, or where would you go?
LC: We would go out on organizing campaigns. I loved it because I love meeting people. We&#8217;d be gone about two weeks, sometimes, but they would let me come home every other weekend. Now when I worked in Martinsville, Virginia, I was there three weeks sometimes and then I would come home and then I&#8217;d go back. But it was so amazing how much it helped, and I guess this was God&#8217;s plan, because it helped my husband and my children grow together, to build that bond that they didn&#8217;t have. It was amazing. I&#8217;d call home: &#8220;Mama, let me tell you what your husband did.&#8221;
JF: [Laughs]
LC: I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s your daddy.&#8221; And I&#8217;d be talking to him: &#8220;Do you know what them crazy kids done?&#8221; I said, &#8220;They&#8217;re yours.&#8221; And it built that relationship that he had never had with those girls, and I thought, work it out. [Laughs]

JF: That&#8217;s wonderful. [Laughs]
LC: I mean they had to work it out. Then it grew on him because he started having trouble at his job and then I would say, that&#8217;s wrong, and back then I sort of kept up on the laws, labor laws and stuff like that. I said they&#8217;re never going to do nothing if you don&#8217;t speak up. He&#8217;s quiet. I said if you don&#8217;t talk for yourself and go get them union people behind you, I said it&#8217;s going to stay the same. So it grew on him.
JF: Did he ever end up joining the union?
LC: Well he already belonged to it, but he went and he started being a representative too with the union, so I made that stride. [Laughs] But he didn&#8217;t bother me anymore when I had to go out of town on campaigns. Back then it was campaign after campaign after campaign and we were winning, and I think that just got my blood boiling just that much more, because we were winning those elections.
JF: Wow.
LC: I got to meet different people, I made friends everywhere I went, and it was nice, and the only reason I got to go is because we had negotiated in our contract that leave of absence for people to go out.
JF: That would be so important, huh?
LC: Very important, because see the company probably wouldn&#8217;t let you go. They were so strict back then and they wouldn&#8217;t let you go but we had negotiated that in there so we could have a leave of absence.
JF: If the workers couldn&#8217;t leave it would just be like the union higher ups?  LC: Oh yeah.  JF: The full time union people.  LC: And you go out and talk to the workers, trying to organize a union, what is a Bruce Raynor or what is a Mark Pitt or a Doug Gamble going to be able to tell them? They ain&#8217;t never worked in a factory. Well Mark did. I think Bruce might have. But I&#8217;m a young person, I&#8217;m a mother, I&#8217;m a wife, and I work in a factory, and I can relate to them about stuff that&#8217;s going on in their factory better than they would have been able to. I mean really that&#8217;s just the way it was. It was just young&#8212;I mean, just working people to working people, being treated unfairly, and I never told them everything was going to be perfect with a union because I knew for a fact that it wasn&#8217;t. It was an every day fight. I mean that&#8217;s just the way it was.  JF: Were there more African Americans workers in the factories because of efforts from groups like the Urban League and&#8212;  LC: Yes, very much so.  JF: &#8212;was the union&#8212;?  LC: Yeah, but you know&#8212;. It was, it became a lot more, but in the end when the layoffs started you know, last hired, first laid off, so that became a problem until they&#8212;. But that&#8217;s one thing I can say the union had done. We had worked every year, I mean every contract year, to get better benefits for our people, and we actually had some darn good benefits at one point in time, we did, and the wages were not that bad at all, so making, you know, union benefits. People would get mad a lot of times: Why is she gone? Taking our union money and she&#8217;s gone here.  JF: Your coworkers?  LC: Mm hmm, but when I come back I give a report on where I&#8217;ve been and what I&#8217;ve been doing, and it was okay. I mean I&#8217;ve found out as long as you communicate to people they&#8217;ll understand. They may not like it but they&#8217;ll understand. Because after I became union steward I became the vice president. The president was a very wise older lady. I love her to death.  JF: Do you remember her name?  LC: Ruby Pryor.  JF: Pryor, P-r-y-o-r?  LC: Mm hmm. She was the president, wise woman, smart woman, and she taught me. She took me under her wing and I mean every word, when she would go&#8212;. Other presidents didn&#8217;t really carry the vice president a whole lot with them. She took me every step of the way, from grievances to going to talk somebody out of not being fired, every step of the way, and then she got where she would just not go. She&#8217;d call me and she&#8217;d say, &#8220;Luvernal, go to the office and do&#8212;,&#8221; some problem that they&#8217;re working on, &#8220;And don&#8217;t come back until you got it all fixed.&#8221;  JF: [Laughs]  LC: I mean she taught me. She was a very, very wise lady. She could read that company like nobody&#8217;s business. [Laughs] She got sick and so she said she was going to&#8212;. I kept wondering actually why she was making me do more and more and more. I knew she was sick; she had been sick for years.
JF: Is she the same woman who was president and handed you the union card?  LC: No. I knew she was sick and she told me she was going to retire. I said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t! You can&#8217;t leave me here!&#8221; and she said, &#8220;You can do it.&#8221; So when she retired then I stepped in to be the president, to let people know that I could still do that leadership before election time came.  JF: This was when it was still ACTWU, before&#8212;or was it UNITE by then?  LC: It was UNITE. It was UNITE then.  JF: And this was in the early [19]80s?  LC: No. I don&#8217;t think we merged until the [19]90s. I think it was [19]90s. That was a mess. [Laughs]  JF: I want to hear about that, but let me ask you something before I forget because I&#8217;m noticing that&#8212;. So the woman who handed you a union card was the president and then you were working under another woman president. Was this unusual, that there were women in leadership, or was it common? Were there a lot of women involved in the union?  LC: It was more women involved than men. Now we had a male maintenance president in between there somewhere, [from] electricians and maintenance, but when you get one of that group in there that&#8217;s their group. I mean you go to negotiations, it&#8217;s for mostly that group.  JF: Oh, yeah.  LC: And so women had to really take the leadership in order for us to be taken care of, and it was mostly women.  JF: So the electricians were skilled men, taking care of their own&#8212;.  LC: Making more money and&#8212;. They would take care of us, but we saw that it was more dedication to that particular group, and the people didn&#8217;t like that so they went back, because it was more women than it was men, to women leading the leadership. Now before I left the plant we had another maintenance man as president. But I knew it was my time to leave. [Laughs]  JF: Were there ever any problems with men, male workers, male unionists, having a woman in a leadership position over them?  LC: Any issues?  JF: Any resentment?  LC: Well I&#8217;m sure.  JF: Or skepticism that a woman can do this?  LC: Oh absolutely. Most men did. Back in the early days they didn&#8217;t like it, to have to answer to a woman or be told something by a woman that was something they didn&#8217;t like, or maybe they hadn&#8217;t violated a contract or nothing like that. No, it was absolutely&#8212;they resented it. They resented it.  JF: Did Ruby teach you some skills or give you some advice on how to deal with that?  LC: Yes, and on particular people too. She would know if there was a problem: &#8220;Now don&#8217;t go down there.&#8221; At one point&#8212;well that&#8217;s later, but she said, don&#8217;t go down there; just listen and then come back. She said don&#8217;t get in an argument with them.  She said there&#8217;ll liable to cuss you out and everything else. You got to get used to it because that&#8217;s no reflection on you; they&#8217;re mad. So I had to grin and bear it. I&#8217;d take a little notepad and write down what they say, and if I knew in my head, because I knew that contract backwards and forwards, then I would tell them I will get the paperwork ready or I will go talk to them up front and see if we can get this straightened out.  JF: Sounds like good advice.  LC: Yeah. She did, she taught me very well, so I got to learn everybody. I got to learn people in general. People are different. They have different ways of expressing theirselves. I have a different way of expressing myself. I can get hot but I can also stand in your face and tell you if you&#8217;re wrong, and I think that&#8217;s what they liked most about me, is that I would be honest and up front but I would do my best. Sometimes I told some little stories [Laughs] just to keep a person&#8217;s job there, or to help them out. [Laughs] I did, or exaggerated a lot. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs]  LC: But I built a rapport after she left. She and I both actually had two plants we were working. We were working with the Atlantic Research side, because we brought those jobs in, and we were working with our side. By then it was called BREED Technologies. Those jobs, we agreed to make that a different plant but we gave people that were in our side the first opportunity before they started hiring anybody to move to the new side, but they went at a lower rate of pay and a few different benefits than what we had. We had to make sure they were minimal benefits because if you don&#8217;t the next negotiations the company was going to be looking for us to give those same little minimal benefits. So we had a good agreement between them so they became like a partner and then they bought the whole thing out eventually. But I was president of two locals by myself with over&#8212;oh lord. ARC had about a thousand-something workers and we had about fourteen or fifteen hundred at one time.  JF: My gosh.  LC: So I was on the go.  JF: How old were your daughters around then, when you were president?  LC: They were out of school.  JF: Okay.  LC: They were out of school, so that was good. But I was doing a lot of running around, phone calls at night, wake you up. I&#8217;d get in my little car and drive down there in the middle of the night. I mean kids will be kids and they had begun to hire a bunch of young kids. I didn&#8217;t have nothing against them, I had some myself, but their work ethic is not the same. [Laughs] It&#8217;s not. But I managed them both. I&#8217;d have grievances with the&#8212;we called it Bayco &#8212;the Atlantic Research side, with their people and my HR manager, and then I would have the people on the BREED side&#8217;s grievances with the people on that side. I had a book, a calendar. I was all day going.   JF: Wow. But you must have loved it.  LC: I did love it.  JF: What did you like best about it?  LC: It was being able to show that company that they can&#8217;t treat people like crap and get by with it. I mean just treat them with decency and respect, that&#8217;s all they ask, a little compassion; not going to kill you. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] What was most frustrating or hardest?  LC: Most frustrating was&#8230; some of the HR managers on that side. By that time we had Brad Rayson as the manager. When we merged we had Doug [Gamble]. When they became a separate entity altogether, they voted their own president in and got their own local and all that stuff, that was a relief. Doug stayed with us. I mean if I had a question I&#8217;d call him, I don&#8217;t care what time. [Laughs] We were like two peas in a pod.   JF: [Laughs]  LC: And he helped me to understand a lot and would explain to me a lot of the legal stuff, and that was what I relied on him most of the time for. When I called him to come he knew to come because he would be as mad as I was by the time he got there. [Laughs] He didn&#8217;t care, he&#8217;d let them have it. That&#8217;s another growing process, was under his leadership. He let me use my knowledge, my experience and stuff, to do what I had to do with the company and sometimes I would tell him afterwards, get his opinion afterwards, but it was good. It&#8217;s because we worked together like brothers and sisters, we really did, and I enjoyed working with Doug.  JF: Did you ever disagree about stuff?  LC: Yeah, we did, and we&#8217;d fuss, but it was like you fuss, okay; let&#8217;s agree to disagree. Then he&#8217;d tell me his reasons why, I&#8217;d tell him my reasons why we should, and then we&#8217;d meet at this happy medium. But I always listened to him. He may not think I did sometimes but I did, I really did. [Laughs] But he really let me run that almost by myself. He was there, we set up teams under him, teamwork programs, an oversight committee where both the union and the company were involved. We made major improvements under this teamwork and Doug and I were involved in help setting that up, so it worked at the beginning very well, and we were proud of ourselves. [Laughs]  JF: Yeah.  LC: Because of that teamwork is how I got into the facility in Mexico, in the plant, because they didn&#8217;t want to grant me access at first. They were totally against it. I told them, I said, okay. The company has a union-management partnership, we&#8217;re working on every issue together, and I&#8217;m asking for a tour of that facility. Is that teamwork? They come here all the time. They had no choice, unless they wanted to back out on their word. [Laughs] [Break in recording]  JF: So how did you get involved with the project to go to Mexico? What can you tell me about that?  LC: It was in, I think, 1991 and Doug Gamble and Mark Pitt, I was working with them, with the union. Mark had showed me a video where John&#8212;what is his name?  JF: Gaventa.  LC: Gaventa, had been to Mexico and brought some photos back, and I was at the union office and he and I were looking at them, and I thought, goodness gracious. I said this is horrible.  JF: Photos of the working conditions?  LC: Yes. And Allied Signal had a factory there and that&#8217;s where I went. [Allied Signal] left Knoxville, went to Greenville, left Greenville and across the border. That&#8217;s how they slickly done that. The truck drivers were bringing us back a little information about what was going on with the plants and where they were moving to and we found out that they were in Greenville at a non-union facility, because they had moved a lot of jobs out of that plant. Even those spring machines and stuff that I had started work on they had shut just about down. So Mark and Doug were talking and I don&#8217;t know how it come about bringing up my name to Susan Williams and Fran Ansley at Higlander, and I&#8217;m assuming Doug and Mark did. They asked me would I be interested in going to a meeting at the Highlander Center about these workers.  JF: Did you know about Highlander prior to that?  LC: No, didn&#8217;t know nothing. Susan educated me on Highlander. So I went, because I was intrigued by what they were doing to the people in Mexico, and really I thought the Mexicans were taking our jobs. They&#8217;re the ones that&#8217;s taking our jobs away from us. [Laughs] I mean I was dead set on that. So I went and they were talking about they were going to do a tour, and then I think we all had to put in applications but ACTWU agreed to pay for mine to go. Mark and Doug got them to agree to pay for mine. So, I went but [I had to agree] to come back and educate people in the union. I had to do certain stuff. Well I didn&#8217;t mind that. So that&#8217;s how I got to go on that first trip to Mexico, and we drove. The most awkward thing is that we had a TV camera&#8212;PBS, Nova, was with us, cameras in your face, over your head, as we drove. Let&#8217;s see, how many was it? I think it was about nine. We had two vans, we drove, and when we crossed over into the border we went through Matamoros. I was just devastated to see the deplorable conditions that there were. I was in shock, and as we talked to workers or people in the community and we would drive around and visit, I was learning, I mean I was just really listening to hear everything.   We had a guide, I can&#8217;t remember his name, he was taking us around there, and he could speak Spanish. He was working with the Maquiladora groups. He took us to this GE factory, and I never will forget this stupid man&#8217;s name, David Henderson [the manager of the factory]. We just walked up on the line, all this big group with this camera crew. I mean they were everywhere. So we walked up and we asked to speak to the manager. They told us we couldn&#8217;t be in there and we just stood there so they finally went and got the manager. We were looking at their little displays and stuff. So he come out and we told him who we were, and he didn&#8217;t want other people coming into that factory seeing us all standing out there so he invited us to a conference room. When he did that we started asking different questions about the workers and how young they were, how many they were. We asked for a tour of the facility and he was talking about they take good care of their workers. Have you ever seen that video?  JF: I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen the Nova video, no.  LC: It&#8217;s From the Mountains to the Maquiladoras. I think that&#8217;s what it is. It can show you how stupid he was [Laughs] by answering these questions. We asked him how much does he pay his average worker. [Imitates shrugging] You don&#8217;t know how much you pay the workers? [Laughs]   JF: [Laughs]  LC: He lived on the other side of the border, he would come to work over there, and [he&#8217;s telling us] that he took care of his workers. He was telling us that they had had a flood and he took pumps out there. I said, my God, is that all you did? These people are living in cardboard boxes, little houses, little huts; I mean it was just nothing. Right behind the Allied factory there were cardboard boxes with &#8220;Allied&#8221; wrote on them, &#8220;gaylords&#8221; is what we used to call them, and people were actually living there in those conditions and coming to work and they&#8217;re paying them fifty cent, two dollars a day, like he was doing them a great favor. He just made an idiot out of himself in that meeting, I mean a pure idiot. When we left out of there I thought, Jesus Christ. [Laughs]   We went on into the villages, the little colonias, is what we called them. We went on in and talked to people, different people who worked at different shops, and how proud they were, and then they were telling us what the conditions were like, and I tell you, when I got back from that trip I nearly&#8212;I mean I cried. We all, when we pulled up in there, there wasn&#8217;t a dry eye in either van. It&#8217;s because of what we saw, stagnating water, kids running everywhere, I mean just&#8212;. But when you went inside their homes they were very proud people, very nice, invited you in, you could not ask for better meeting people. But we were all just crying, and I thought to myself, when I go back home I&#8217;m going to have a talk with two little young ladies, and I did. When I walked in the door I told them, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to tell you something. You two don&#8217;t know how well you have it.&#8221; I said, &#8220;The food we throw away around here or you don&#8217;t want and you don&#8217;t like is going to stop. Because there&#8217;s people out there working as hard as your mama or harder for nothing, and they don&#8217;t have the luxuries that you have, and this is not much but this is a lot.&#8221; I said, &#8220;So don&#8217;t even think about it no more; just be glad you&#8217;re blessed.&#8221;   I mean that tore me up. [Laughs] I mean it just changed my whole life, and at that particular time in my life I realized it wasn&#8217;t them that were taking our jobs. They were working just like I was, trying to make good for their families, just the same as I was. It was the corporations&#8217; greed. They were the ones making the money. They weren&#8217;t paying them nothing.   So when we came back we did churches, talking about it; we went to schools; we just had different open sessions. We went everywhere and talked. I did workshops at the union, I went to the convention where everybody was there and had to do my presentation and slideshow and stuff like that, so everybody would be aware and we&#8217;d get more people involved in it. But it hurts now to think about what I saw that first time. It was terrible. And then I went again for a health and safety conference for the workers. That was just me and Fran [Ansley]. We stayed in an old convent, [Laughs] old convent. I tell you, Fran, she can just do anything. I had to learn how to do all this stuff. But then it became okay because once you got to teaching them about the health and safety aspects of what needs to be done&#8212;. They have a good contract in Mexico, the workers do, but it&#8217;s not enforced because it&#8217;s run by the government, so it does them not any good at all. We talked to a few people who are trying to make a difference, trying to make things better, some that had been blackballed out of the factories because of their involvement with trying to work with unions to get stuff straightened out.   That turned out to be a good workshop, very good. I learned a lot from them and Fran and I were able to teach a lot to them. We got to tour a factory and when we got to the factory I was showing them my paycheck stub. They told me I was too old&#8212;see they only hire young people. [Laughs] I got so tickled. [Laughs] I was too old; they wouldn&#8217;t have hired me down there. And when I showed them my paycheck stub that I make at the same [kind of] plant where they&#8217;re working, it was unbelievable. That kind of proof was powerful to those people. The women were telling me they even check them to see if they&#8217;re pregnant, you know, like their monthly&#8212;. It was deplorable. It was awful, and I thought, no self respect. You can&#8217;t even have any. They took out of their check their bus fare&#8212;out of this little money they was getting&#8212;their bus fare to work. They picked them up and they were jam packed in there like I don&#8217;t know what. We&#8217;d see the buses picking them up, taking them and dropping them off. They took out their lunch. They had a little cafeteria-like thing. I went in there and looked at it and that&#8217;s about all. They give them something like our food stamps. I would just tell them, you don&#8217;t have to do this. You don&#8217;t have to live like this. We all would talk to them and then we would regroup and talk to each other. That was the very good part at the end of every day. We didn&#8217;t stay across the border [in Mexico] but one time. Now I stayed twice actually, one time with the whole first group, we stayed there.   Outside [of the lodging on the American side of the border] there was guards walking with guns and stuff, scared me half to death. We were all afraid and we all bundled up in one room. So we would take times&#8212;because it was so many bugs&#8212;we would take time sleeping.  We didn&#8217;t want to act like we were better than them, because we brought some of the workers with us&#8212;that was a treat and a joy to them. So for us not to be like, we&#8217;re better than this, we didn&#8217;t do it in front of them. We weren&#8217;t any better; it&#8217;s just that we weren&#8217;t used to it. So some of us would sleep about thirty minutes or so then the other would lay down and go to sleep, so we could watch where nothing would bother us. We all got up, and it just so happened we brought this great big huge thing of baby wipes. That&#8217;s how we bathed. We were not getting in that shower. But [the Mexican workers] were in another room and they were just happy, I mean because it was a joy to them. But we enjoyed our time. At nighttime at the pool we&#8217;d talk and listen to their stories and we would tell our stories and we made a quilt. Have you ever seen that picture?  JF: No.  LC: There&#8217;s a quilt we made, and they done a skit for us and we done a skit for them about how unions work up here, how we handle stuff, and we made a quilt here and we took it and we gave it to them as a gift and we all sat around in a circle. We had interpreters and we all sat around in circles and everybody would talk about their situation and how stuff was going with them and we would talk and it was just so awesome. It was awesome. It was.  Jessie Wilkerson: What did the quilt look like?  LC: It had different pieces of union stuff, just different pieces of how we felt about trying to make this connection work, being partners instead of enemies, togetherness. We&#8212;oh, it was awesome. It was. I could talk all day.  JF: [Laughs]  LC: But I enjoyed that. And then one trip, I think the last one that I went on, it was a group of us. This was to do home stays. [Laughs]  JF: Home stays?  LC: Home visits. We were going to stay in one of the homes across the border, in the colonia. Fran had made some connections with some different people. I said, "Lord, am I going to stay, or am I not going to stay? Am I going to stay [Laughs] or am I not going to stay?&#8221; Then I thought, what makes me better than them? Everybody wasn&#8217;t volunteering at first now. I&#8217;ll tell you what. Everybody wasn&#8217;t volunteering.
JF: [Laughs]
LC: When we got to Texas, Anne was there. We met Anne in Texas, and&#8212;.

JF: Anne Lewis?
LC: Uh huh. We got there and we stayed in another convent but it was&#8212;. [Whispers &#8220;nicer.&#8221;] I enjoyed that too. I like staying in older places because I like history. I decided, I said, &#8220;Okay, Fran; I&#8217;m going to do one.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Now you know I don&#8217;t speak a bit of Spanish.&#8221; The first group was laughing at me because they were trying to teach me [Laughs] how to speak Spanish and I couldn&#8217;t roll my Rs at all. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs]
LC: They would just laugh. I said, &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak a bit.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Well they&#8217;ve got a student,&#8221; so the student was going to go with me. Everybody that volunteered, what we were going to have to do was [decide] who was going to do the first nights, who was going to do the next night. So I said I might as well get mine over first.
JF: [Laughs]
LC: We went down through the colonia and we talked to the people in the neighborhood. When we drove in we saw children playing and the shacks were no bigger than my whole living room, maybe, if that big. Some of them were, and then some of them was about half. They were [installing] electricity, bless their hearts, so they could have lights and stuff. It was laying on the ground. It was dirt roads and hills and all that. We looked around and some of the houses were okay. They had maybe a house the man had been working on, and you see stacks of bricks outside where they were doing the best that they can to build. So I said I might as well get mine over with.   When we went back that night we went back a little earlier and the biggest thing was happening; they were having a party. A little girl was graduating from the sixth to the seventh grade, and that was a big to-do. They were dressed up, fancy ruffled dresses, socks. So everybody in that little community came to the party. We just went to the party, they had cake and ice cream, they made a big deal out of it, and we had the best time. Didn&#8217;t know how to do their dance but we just danced and we had a good time.
JF: [Laughs]
LC: We had a good time. We had brought one van down and we parked the van and we paid some guys to stay awake all night and watch that van. I think Fran was up at a house up the street and there was another girl right across the street and then me. We had our sleeping bags and all that stuff. Well when I got over to meet the girl, the lady of the house, she was getting ready to go to work, and she had three kids. My daughter had long got married, so they told us to bring pictures of our family and stuff like that so I had my photo albums and my sleeping bag and all that stuff, and I didn&#8217;t understand them. The interpreter said that she was cooking us some supper. I have a sensitive stomach and she had all these hot peppers in there.
JF: [Laughs]
LC: And I thought, oh my, if I eat this I&#8217;m going to be sick, and if I don&#8217;t eat it I&#8217;m going to feel rude. She told me I was a wimp. I said not too many peppers. [Laughs] She called me a wimp.
JF: [Laughs]
LC: But what she was doing, she was making these burritos and she was wrapping them up and she takes them and sells them on her way to work to make extra money. I ate it, I ate it, but I would not drink the water. We had brought our own bottled water so I drank my own water and I was very careful about that, and I took some Pepto-Bismol so I wouldn&#8217;t be too sick. Then I said, &#8220;Are you getting ready to go to work?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; and I thought she was going to be there with us all night. She said, &#8220;You my babysitter,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;What did she say?&#8221; The interpreter said, &#8220;You&#8217;re babysitting.&#8221; I said, oh my God. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs]
LC: So I said, okay. The kids were kind of shy at first and then I would tell her to tell them to come over. I started bringing out my pictures and we bonded. We all just bonded and she would interpret what I&#8217;d say and she&#8217;d tell me what the kids would say, then they ran and got pictures and they were telling me who this was, their auntie who lived somewhere, and they were telling me that that was their dad, and I said, &#8220;Where is your dad?&#8221; Then they told me that he was in jail and stuff like that.   Then it kind of got late and I said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it time to go to bed?&#8221; She had two things that was up on the wall and one down here with mattresses on them, and they were sleeping in there. They had a little table with a little lamp, she was one of those that had the electricity that they were getting off of the street to her house, and it was so hot. It was really, really hot. But it didn&#8217;t seem to bother them, I guess because they were used to it. They had a little room that was about from here to here, and in here she had a bed and over here she had like a little hole that had a tub in it, like for you to use the bathroom. No running water, and you could look out there and you could see the bank. It was not very good smelling but you could see it. I thought I don&#8217;t know if I can use this bathroom, but I had to go to the bathroom, so I did. She had water for it, she had brought in, and she had gave us a sheet on her bed, but we had brought sleeping bags. So I got in my sleeping bag and the girl got in her sleeping bag and we laid down and went to sleep. The next morning the kids come in there, [Sound of pattering feet] and we got up and went outside, and the kids were playing. Well I didn&#8217;t know what to fix them for breakfast, but their mom was coming home, because she said the mother would come home early. So I was always wondering, who would keep these kids while she works at night?
JF: Yeah, I was going to ask that.
LC: Her oldest child was the one who watched them. She didn&#8217;t have anybody, didn&#8217;t even have the money to pay anybody, and every day she would make up this stuff to sell on her way to work in order to make enough money to survive. She was telling me how she wanted&#8212;. She had some wood stuff piled up in the back. She was wanting to fix her house up but she had to wait until she got enough to do, but it was nice and clean. I never would have thought this, but I got up that morning and I was just walking up and down the road, because I smoke, [Laughs] so I was walking up and down the road, just enjoying the view at the daylight when things were quiet and not so busy going, then we seen her coming over the rise, home. I didn&#8217;t get to spend very much time with her because we had some other things that we were going to do. I thanked her very much. She said, &#8220;You come back tonight?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Uh&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; Fran said, &#8220;Are you going back tonight?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a little overwhelming.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But it was good.&#8221;   When I got back I was exhausted because you sleep and you don&#8217;t sleep&#8212;you know, you&#8217;re in a strange place. I didn&#8217;t go back the second night. I let somebody else go do a house visit and they took their turn, but if I had wanted to go, they were saying to me, &#8220;You can go if you want to.&#8221;
JF: [Laughs]
LC: I said it&#8217;s not that bad, as long as you have somebody there to tell you what they&#8217;re saying, because I had no clue. [Laughs] And it was interesting, this student was so sweet. She was so sweet to help me interpret what everybody was saying. But we enjoyed that. I enjoyed that house visit, I really did. I didn&#8217;t think I would but I did. I think Fran enjoyed hers. You know Fran, she&#8217;d stay a week. [Laughs]
JF: [Laughs]
LC: Fran would stay a week, she would. But I enjoyed the trips that I had and I learned something new every time I would go, you know, how they were trying to come across the borders for better lives. If I was living there, and me as a mother or a father, I would do it too. In some of those areas I would do it too. I hate to say that, and it&#8217;s illegal, but it's the truth. To help my family survive. A lot of the families, the men were living over here in the United States, they were over here working and sending money home. We talked to a lot of families, oh, and they were just so glad to talk to us. Fran and Susan could speak a little bit of Spanish&#8212;I couldn&#8217;t speak none&#8212;but it was just so interesting. There&#8217;s never been anything like those trips that ever touched me. I have some friends who say, &#8220;Now, I know how you feel about Mexico &#8211; &#8221; I say, &#8220;And don&#8217;t start.&#8221; I say, &#8220;Because they&#8217;re fighting for the same right that we&#8217;re fighting for. You ain&#8217;t ever worked in a factory. You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like. Those are human beings with children just like I am.&#8221; I mean I have friends that don&#8217;t believe that they should be over here working. I think they should be legal, but they don&#8217;t believe in it. I say, well the United States let&#8217;s everybody in. We&#8217;re a free country. What you say? [Laughs]
JF: Well how did you get involved with the Morristown documentary?
LC: Whoo, let&#8217;s see. How did that come about? Fran. She called me and said that they wanted to do the Morristown video and she wanted to interview me, and Janice Perkins was with me. Did you see the girl that sat with me in it? There was a lady, a girl.
JF: I don&#8217;t remember.
LC: She was active in the Bayco part of my plant. We were in the same building but it was a different part. Fran asked us if we would talk about it and tell how we felt about it.
JF: About going to Mexico?
LC: About going to Mexico, and I told them yes, I would. I mean I didn&#8217;t mind. I want the whole world to hear. That&#8217;s how we got involved with them, and I had known the other people that she interviewed, Shirley [Reinhardt], I&#8217;ve known them for a while. It was just easy at that point, because the feelings to me sometimes are still very raw. When I think about it they&#8217;re raw to me and I could bust out in tears and sometimes&#8212;. I mean it&#8217;s just&#8212;. It was just so awful and it still is awful. There&#8217;s not a whole lot more accomplished. I know more people&#8212;. I haven&#8217;t been keeping up on a lot like I used to. I used to read everything, I mean everything. You name it, I read it, about what was going on, with free trade. I still didn&#8217;t mind the free trade. It was just the way they went about it, and that&#8217;s what I hold against [President Bill] Clinton. Otherwise, good President, but he opened up a can of worms, he really did.   But that&#8217;s how I got involved with Morristown. I think it was Anne who done the videoing, set up, turned the table around and everything else. [Laughs] But Anne&#8217;s good. That&#8217;s how I got involved in that.  JF: And you&#8217;ve done some events and speeches about the documentary. I saw online that you&#8217;ve done one with Bill Troy.   LC: Yeah. I think the last one me and Bill were at the University of Tennessee talking to some students, and it was very emotional for me at that point because I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it again, but sitting there watching it and talking about it, it was good, and the students had so many questions. I liked answering them.  JW: I think I was there that time.  LC: Yeah, you were.  JW: Yeah, it was really good.  LC: I thought it went very well. I know some kids that go to high school have walked up: &#8220;Miss Luvernal, I saw you on a video at my school.&#8221;  JF: [Laughs]  LC: I said, &#8220;What?&#8221; &#8220;Yes, I saw you. I said, &#8216;I know that lady.&#8217;&#8221; [Laughs] So I know some schools are showing it, I know some are.  JF: And how have you felt about the&#8212;? In the past few years the raids have picked up on factories, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] looking for illegal immigrants.  LC: They&#8217;re only doing that because they were pressured to do that, and I think eventually exactly what&#8217;s going to happen, it&#8217;s going to be re-filled up again, and they claiming they don&#8217;t know. But they are raiding them, and they don&#8217;t have any rights. The way they treat them is what gets me. They treat them awful, they really do, and [for a] company to say they didn&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s a bunch of bull. That&#8217;s a bunch of bull. I don&#8217;t like it because that could be us. That could be anybody who&#8217;s undocumented and who wants to have a better life.   I was looking into a little bit about that woman. She&#8217;s not from Mexico but she&#8217;s from somewhere else and her child was born to this soldier and they don&#8217;t want to give her the rights to come back into the United States to be a United States citizen. But they don&#8217;t make it easy for them to become citizens, and that&#8217;s what [President] Barack Obama needs to work on. Oh, I email him letters.  JF: [Laughs]  LC: I email the White House. When I feel strongly about something, about what they&#8217;re doing and what he&#8217;s doing, and if he intends to be reelected he&#8217;s got to tap into that. He&#8217;s got to tap into that group of people because it&#8217;s a lot here that could make or break him. He may not see it that way but they can, so why not try to make legalization just a bit easier for everybody to become a US citizen, because I&#8217;m sure they want to. He&#8217;s got his work cut out for him. [Laughs] I&#8217;m a big Barack fan, proud of him. He makes mistakes but I&#8217;m a big Barack fan. I thank God I lived to see this day.   JF: Yeah.  LC: I thought I&#8217;d never, but for history.  JF: What was the election night like?  LC: I worked the election.  JF: You did?  LC: That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been doing for the past two or three years, working part time in elections. Learning now more about crooks, politics, and all that drama. Until you get yourself stuck in something where you hear stuff and then you go read about it and study about it&#8230; it&#8217;s all political. Everything is political. But I was working the night of the presidential election. The polls had closed, and what we do is take the votes out of the box and take it upstairs to people to count it, make sure we get all those boxes up there so they can count them. That&#8217;s what I was doing. I left, because I could clean the mess up the next day. That was our job for the next month, clean that up. So I went home, I got home, and as soon as I walked in the house I cut the TV on. [Laughs] And I saw it! No, I didn&#8217;t. I take that back. I went to the internet. I cut the TV on, went to the internet, and I pulled it up on the internet and it said he had been declared the winner. I screamed. [Laughs] I came back in here and I was calling my girlfriend, &#8220;He won! He won! He won!&#8221; and she said, &#8220;He did?&#8221; and about that time it come across the TV, but the internet had it first. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs]  LC: I was so happy. I was jumping up and down in this house by myself. [Laughs] There wasn&#8217;t nobody home. But I ran in here, cut the TV on, then I ran back to my computer and I pulled it up on the computer and it had just declared him the winner, and I thought, oh, a day in history.  JW: Did your parents get to see it? Were they still living?  LC: My dad did. My mom&#8217;s gone, but my dad did. It don&#8217;t make my daddy no difference who the President is. [Laughs] He ain't into all that. [Laughs] He&#8217;s a hardworking man, has to stay busy. He don&#8217;t get involved in nothing like that. But I get involved when I see that there&#8217;s things that are out there that can help him, so I take on that responsibility of doing that.  JF: Do you think we&#8217;ll see a woman President?  LC: Probably. You might. Well it might not be too long now. Now Hilary, she may knock it out. Now I&#8217;m going to tell you, I don&#8217;t like Sarah Palin. She&#8217;s too whacky.  JF: [Laughs]  LC: She&#8217;s just to me not presidential material, I&#8217;ll be honest. She&#8217;s just not. But Hilary would make a good one, I believe. I really do. And I hope we get to see a woman President, I really do. That would be great. [Laughs] Women and their rights! [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] [Break in recording from 1:16:23 to 1:16:32] In the 1970s there was nationwide a lot of unrest, a lot of social unrest and a lot of demonstrations and protesting and activities around women&#8217;s issues. Was this going on in Knoxville?  LC: A little. It was more down towards the University of Tennessee area, more&#8230;well you can say some black women were trying to move up who weren&#8217;t able to move up. It was just rough in those days for women period, to me. I don&#8217;t think men&#8212;. To me, men had been brought up to where the women were below them, and now the women were coming out, coming up to be making the same amount of money, being able to make the same amount. I think they resented that. Then it was fights among women theirselves. Some still believed that a woman&#8217;s place is in the home and the others, &#8220;I can juggle it all and have what I want.&#8221; And I think now it&#8217;s a lot better. There&#8217;s still that issue but it&#8217;s a lot better because women have stood their ground to become what they want to be in life, regardless of what the man says.   But I never thought that I was beneath no man. I actually never thought I was beneath anybody. [Laughs] Because my parents always told me that you can do what you want to do no matter what it takes. If you have to fight for it, you have to fight for it. They worked hard. My mom worked as a housekeeper and babysitter. I didn&#8217;t want that life, no. I don&#8217;t clean up my own; I ain&#8217;t going to clean up nobody else&#8217;s. But that&#8217;s just the way they were raised in that generation. I told my girls, you have every right to do anything you want to do, no matter the color of your skin, no matter what age you are, and if you&#8217;re a woman, especially if a woman, no man can dominate you. Don&#8217;t let them. You take charge of your own life. I mean that&#8217;s just about it. Women are still struggling but not nearly as bad. I thought, lord, we didn&#8217;t have no voice in nothing years ago. We didn&#8217;t. But they&#8217;ve come a long way. They&#8217;ve come a long, long way.   I know I fought hard as a black mother coming up, as a woman. When I had my first kid and I was traveling by bus and how people would treat you for racial reasons or because you were a woman. I didn&#8217;t know it then but as I think about it years later there was a course there that was telling me: this is the path you&#8217;re going to have to fight for the rest of your life. When they wouldn&#8217;t serve me and I demanded to be served. They wouldn&#8217;t give my baby no milk. I was buying milk and they wanted to wait on everybody besides me, and that man said, &#8220;She was here first,&#8221; and it was like I wasn&#8217;t there. That was horrible, but I got my baby some milk.   JW: Where was that?  LC: In Chatsworth, Georgia. Yeah, that&#8217;s where the bus made the stop. It was horrible, because I never encountered stuff like that. As I thought about it later, that was part of who God was making me out to be. I think about that. I think about sometimes things that I had an opportunity to do, why did I do this, what made me do this, but that was on my path of growing to where I wanted to be, and I realized that and so I kept growing. Then at some point it was time for me to stop doing that because I had other things. I began taking care of people. I didn&#8217;t stop working with people, it was just in a different role, and I&#8217;m still involved with older people at my church. It&#8217;s those older people that touch my heart, so I do what I can for them. But as far as women...  JF: Was the union doing anything?  LC: For women?  JF: Mm hmm.  LC: Mm mm, not back then. Well you know the unions were usually male dominated. They had a few women on the executive boards and they were moving up a little, but most of the time it was run by men. But they didn&#8217;t try to put women down because actually they figured out women do the best work. Women will be here with you the longest and get out there and do what you ask them to do in bringing in more workers, trying to represent workers. They knew that that was their key.   JF: Did you talk with some of your fellow women coworkers about things that concerned women, parenting, birth control, issues like that?  LC: No, I didn&#8217;t get into much of that, not with parenting and birth control. Just to be honest I really didn&#8217;t. Those that were struggling&#8212;. I talked to a lot of coworkers and helped a lot of coworkers through drug abuse. Women felt comfortable enough if they had a problem to come to me and talk to me about it and I would see, without anybody knowing, about them getting the right help, even taking them to the place, bringing their paperwork to them that they needed to fill out, so it was confidential. That trust I gained among a lot of women who were having issues with drugs and depression. You know at first when someone walks up to you and calls you over and says, &#8220;Luvernal, I need to talk to you, privately.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Okay.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Come off the line. Just let your parts go. Let them go. If they don&#8217;t catch them let them go.&#8221; And they tell you they feel like killing theirself.   I said, &#8220;You feel like what?&#8221; I said, &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t feel that way.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Nothing is that bad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well, just go on back like nothing has happened and I&#8217;ll help you.&#8221; So I went to HR, and I told them it was private, and if it left out of this room I know where it left. So HR called her supervisor and told her that she needed to see this girl in her office, so the supervisor went down and got somebody to take her place and she went to the office and we discussed it and talked to the people, took her to the place, waited until 10:00 at night until they had got everything straightened out and got her help. I mean, you know, you have to build that rapport with people.   JF: She must have really&#8212;  LC: She had kids.  JF: &#8212;trusted you.  LC: I had to go by her sister and tell her sister where she was at. And that wasn&#8217;t easy, and she had kids. So I had to get her kids and take them to her sister&#8217;s house, but all the time this lady that was the HR&#8212;she was the HR generalist, she wasn&#8217;t the HR manager&#8212;she was right there with me. We done all that together and nobody ever knew, and we had a lot of people like that. If I figured they had a problem, like if they&#8217;d do something or get in trouble, I&#8217;d bring them in my office. I&#8217;d say, &#8220;When you get time come out here. I got to talk to you.&#8221; And then we&#8217;d talk and then I&#8217;d tell them, I know. I know these signs. I&#8217;ve seen it too many times. Your job is on the line. You need to get some help. Do you want help? You have to do that. I told Doug we were psychologists, union reps, counselors. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] That&#8217;s pretty amazing. You never hear those kinds of stories about unions. I mean you can&#8217;t because they are confidential.  LC: Yeah.  JF: But you think of a union, okay, well it will get me benefits, it will get me seniority.  LC: No.  JF: You don&#8217;t hear these kinds of stories.  LC: No, it&#8217;s more than that. As I said it was like being a counselor to people who were going through&#8212;. I&#8217;ve heard so many family issues, people going through divorces, people about to lose their children. They would come in my office and literally cry. I had one girl sat in my office and had a nervous breakdown. I shut the door, called HR, told them to come to my office. I said it&#8217;s something very important. They leave out; I take her to the center. See when she would leave with me no one would know. Leaving walking with me, nobody would think anything. Walking with HR everybody would be through the plant going, &#8220;Oh, she done done something.&#8221; But it was horrible. It was horrible. I thought, oh, my goodness. I never seen that before.   But I became a team leader. I became their trainer, so I trained salary people and hourly people. They got all that same training. They all needed it, especially them salary people. They needed to start from the beginning and learn that we are different as hourly workers but we are as good as you. We may not have those degrees you have behind your name but&#8212;. And it opened up a lot of them&#8217;s eyes because a lot of them didn&#8217;t even know really how to be a supervisor, how to treat a person. I said all people want is to be treated right. Respect, that&#8217;s all. I enjoyed that training session, I really did. That was the last part of my stuff I did before I left and I enjoyed that, because you got to teach people different habits and why my idea is different than your idea but that&#8217;s okay. Neither one of them are a bad idea. Let&#8217;s just work together to find a common ground and we can agree to disagree, and I love that.   JF: Do you think that for a lot of the women that would come to you with these problems, you were the only resource they had?  LC: I think so. I think so. I think they came to me because first of all I think they could trust me and second of all they knew that I represented them, so if there was going to be an issue with the company I was going to be that go-between person. They didn&#8217;t have to deal with them face to face; that was left up to me to do. That&#8217;s what they paid their dues for, is for me to represent them. [Laughs] Dues time come, when they raise the dues, I&#8217;d ease it out. I&#8217;d come in real early in the morning, because you have to post it, when the dues go up, and I would think, Lord, let me have a good day, because I know they're going to fuss. But I had to post it, and then someone would say, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know my union dues went up,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;It&#8217;s been on the bulletin board. Been on the bulletin board.&#8221;  JF: [Laughs]  LC: I kept the union board updated. Well actually I was over all communication boards and I made sure our union board had nice new stuff on there, union meetings and all that stuff, updates, and I&#8217;d slip that one up there. [Laughs] Because nobody liked the union dues to go up, but it was a small price to pay for all the benefits and the representation that we had. It&#8217;s a very small price to pay, and those that are working down there now, I know a guy that&#8217;s still working down there. They have taken just about all their benefits that we had away from them, and it&#8217;s sad, because he&#8217;d say, &#8220;Miss Luvernal, didn&#8217;t y&#8217;all used to have&#8212;?&#8221; He&#8217;s a friend of my daughter&#8217;s. And I said, yeah. I said, &#8220;They can&#8217;t do that to you.&#8221; &#8220;Yes they can. They done changed this and they done changed that.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Well I haven&#8217;t been there in a long time so I&#8217;m not going to tell you what&#8217;s right and what ain&#8217;t right because I don&#8217;t even know what the contract says no more,&#8221; but they&#8217;re treating them awful.   Then I get a letter in the mail, same day I got yours, yesterday, from Key Safety who&#8217;s talking about the people that was going to retire after April the 11th, about the pension plans. Because of the economy and stuff there&#8217;s been reductions. There&#8217;s going to be&#8212;. If I understood it correctly no more&#8212;. If you made, according to Pension Guaranteers, if you put in less than five thousand dollars they paid you out, and I don&#8217;t know if they&#8217;re going to even do that anymore. It&#8217;s changing and changing. I just read that and I&#8217;m going to ask for a summary plan description, because they said I can request one, because I know at one point in time our pension plan was overfunded, and I know what happened to it. They don&#8217;t know I know it. So don&#8217;t mess with my pension.  JF: [Laughs]  LC: They&#8217;ll be sorry about that. A lot of stuff was&#8212;. It would be surprising how stuff would drop in your lap, even some of the management people who knew stuff was wrong. I had that kind of rapport with them. They would keep me abreast. Then the company: &#8220;How&#8217;d you get this?&#8221; It don&#8217;t matter. It don&#8217;t matter.  JF: [Laughs] Sounds like the information and knowledge was just key.  LC: It was, it was, very much so.  JF: And how did you create and work networks to get this knowledge and information?  LC: We took those supervisors through training and teaching them how to work, how to work with people, how to be better to people, treat them right, and then you don&#8217;t have all these grievances. Then they were willing to work&#8212;. I had a rapport with them. I could go talk to them in a calm manner but I also tell them off, real nicely. When I threatened, I did, and they knew if I threatened them I was going to do what I was going to do. So we became actually pretty good because a lot of times they were being done wrong and I&#8217;d say, well ain&#8217;t nothing I can do about it. You don&#8217;t pay no union dues. I don&#8217;t represent you. [Laughs] But if what they were doing to them was going to affect the employees out there on the floor then yeah, I&#8217;ll go up there, and they knew it. They knew if somebody was going to get laid off, a good worker, or they was going to try to put extra work on this person, I&#8217;m the first one they come tell because they knew I didn&#8217;t mind going up there being in their face. And a lot of times in negotiations that&#8217;s all you heard from them: &#8220;Okay, Luvernal, get another day off. Get another day off, holiday. Get another day off.&#8221; Because what we got they got. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs]  LC: So I built that rapport with those people that would actually drop information, papers. Ruby taught me how to do that. [Laughs] There&#8217;s nothing like a copy machine. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] And then of course you were in the fight for the Right-to-Know Law.  LC: Yeah.  JF: You want to tell me a little bit about that?  LC: Well, Doug Gamble got me involved in that. He asked me one night. We used to work in chemicals that were cancerous but we didn&#8217;t know it. A lot of them we didn&#8217;t know, but I know it would make me sneeze and make me cough. We had to wear masks and we had to do all this stuff and we didn&#8217;t even know what we were working in. I&#8217;ve always been health and safety. Every month I walked around and done a safety tour with the safety man, every month. Then Doug asked me if I would come and meet this lady who was trying to get a law passed about letting us know about what&#8217;s in all that stuff, because we had all kinds of chemicals in that place. It was called Allied Chemical at one point. So I went and that&#8217;s when I met Corky.  JF: This is Norma Jennings?  LC: Norma Jennings. I call her Corky too. That&#8217;s when I met her, and Corky, Doug and I was in this little bitty room with all these papers around, I can vaguely remember, and they were talking about we were going to go to Nashville. We was going to write a letter and try to send off some stuff to get these laws passed so we could find out the stuff that we were working in before it all killed us all. So it went from there. We went to Nashville, spoke, and then when we came back and when the law was finally passed it was just like a new miracle. I got to find out everything, and then once you find out what you&#8217;re working in you can work on the safety aspects of it. The safety man at Allied, when they passed the law, he had no clue about it. I said, no, you have to give us the MSDS [Material Safety Data Sheets] sheet. You have to tell us what we&#8217;re working in and we have to have this certain protective clothing, and he asked me would I help him, to teach him and the people what we had to do to implement it in there, because it was the law. It was the law.   Corky worked so hard on that. All I did was go and just help them spread the word and testify. I didn&#8217;t do a whole lot but afterwards I did, and our company was up to standards. It was up to standards, because I worked in our lab and every time a new chemical come in that plant: &#8220;I want the MSDS sheet.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It&#8217;s out there in the book.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I want one right here, up here in my office.&#8221; We had an auditor come in one time, and he&#8212;because I was working with chemicals&#8212;and he said, &#8220;Do you use&#8212;?&#8221; that stuff where you&#8217;re supposed to rub it and test the paint. I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I thought they were going to die. The plant manager&#8212;. He said, &#8220;Well why not? You know that&#8217;s part of your rules.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It might be part of the rules but I&#8217;m not using that chemical.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Just read the bottle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have the MSDS sheet up here?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s out there in the book,&#8221; because he ain&#8217;t never brought it to me. The company got mad but then they came back and said that&#8217;s okay. I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m not lying. I don&#8217;t do it. I don&#8217;t test my parts like that. I test them another way but I&#8217;m not using that,&#8221; and I gave the bottle to the man. &#8220;You use it. You read it.&#8221; [Laughs] &#8220;I&#8217;m not using it,&#8221; and we came up to code.   But that was one of the best things for people period, was when that law got passed in Tennessee, because those people were using all kinds of chemicals in different places, and dying in factories, and I still believe in my heart that a lot of people that died, that had cancer and died, was a result of those chemicals that they were working in. Acetone, Xylene, it was just so much, and then in the lab on the E-coat machine we started using this one chemical. In order to clean this thing up there you had to put boots on, cover on your head, mask on, goggles on, shield that come over you, a suit that came all the way up to here, and tie you up to here. That&#8217;s what the thing said, because if it splashed on&#8212;you had to have rubber boots on your shoes&#8212;if it splashed it could eat your shoe.  JF: Oh my gosh.  LC: We didn&#8217;t use it that often but you had to dress up like hazmat. [Laughs] I mean you go by the instructions, you do what it says to do, it&#8217;s okay, but that&#8217;s the way you had to do. And we learned about a lot of those chemicals and if I felt it was unsafe or not enough ventilation I wouldn&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;d call the safety man. But the experience working in the lab taught me a lot because I had worked on some Dacromet machines. The dust that was coming off those parts were getting up our noses, and none of us in that plant knew what we were working in, but we had workers that were dying of cancer. You didn&#8217;t think much about it, and then after we started finding out what was in all this stuff I said well it ain&#8217;t no wonder.   So they were very cautious after that, but they didn&#8217;t care nothing about the workers in Mexico. They were exposed to that. When we went down there they didn&#8217;t have masks and stuff on, and that was one of the things I questioned them about. Why don&#8217;t they have a mask on? Why are they working in this? So, that was good, that was a good law, and she worked so hard on it.  JF: What did you think of Corky when you met her?  LC: She was the most friendliest, jolliest woman I ever met. [Laughs] She was. She was just happy, and that&#8217;s the reason it saddens me to hear you say she&#8217;s just been out of the&#8212;. I know she&#8217;s been out of the limelight because I haven&#8217;t seen her, haven&#8217;t heard from her, but she don&#8217;t know what that&#8212;. She knows exactly what she did helped all of us. The work she done helped workers all over the world, really, the work she done, and I was just glad to be a part of it. It was a small little part but I was glad to be a part.   JF: It sounds like yet again there&#8217;s something you&#8217;re involved in where there&#8217;s a lot of women and a lot of women in leadership.  LC: Oh, yeah, yeah, and especially in that particular time there were a lot of women that were having kids, were pregnant, that worked in that plant. Now I carried my last baby working in that plant, so there was a lot of women at that time&#8212;. We were young women having children and being exposed to this kind of stuff. So women were right on it, they were right on it, and after they learned better about what they were working on they refused to work on it, and that&#8217;s why they began having more safety meetings. The company stopped letting people bring in stuff that didn&#8217;t meet the standards and stuff like that, and then instead of storing it inside of the plant they set up an outside warehouse and it was stored out there and it was brought to us as needed. That place could have went up in flames. But they started putting everything out in a shed, a temperature controlled shed, so that was good. If I needed a drum of this or a drum of that I had tap it, make sure it was empty, put the lid on there, tighten the band back on there, had to put this sign on the front whether it was hazardous, whether it was empty, and what was in it before I could even ship it back outside, so they&#8217;d know how to store it. The law, I mean it made a world of difference in there. The procedures changed completely about what we had to do.   JF: Would you have thought of yourself as a feminist? Do you think of yourself as a feminist?  LC: I really hadn&#8217;t. [Laughs] I really don&#8217;t think of myself very much&#8212;. I&#8217;m a person that, I&#8217;ve got an opinion. I have an opinion. Whether you like it or not I&#8217;ve got an opinion, is what I tell my children.  JF: [Laughs]  LC: And that I&#8217;m not going to let something hold me back when I know it is right for women, especially for women, because I don&#8217;t like to see people put women down, because if it wasn&#8217;t for women this world wouldn&#8217;t be what it is right now. So I don&#8217;t brag about it. I just think, I&#8217;m just me. I&#8217;m just me. [Laughs] I like to give, I like to learn, and I&#8217;ll try new stuff, like going to a meeting downtown, standing up at a mic&#8212;I never done that before&#8212;and asking a question to a commissioner. That felt good. That&#8217;s new. [Laughs] That&#8217;s new. It&#8217;s new for me. But it felt good to be able to express how I feel inside about issues, and I&#8217;m very passionate about some of them, very, very passionate about some of them. I wish I could do&#8212;. I&#8217;m getting older, but I wish I could do more, get more involved than what I have been in the past few years, but there was a point in my life where it was just so much I had to focus somewhere else. And now it&#8217;s getting better, grandkids growing up a little bit, life is getting a little easier as I get older, but I enjoy my life. [Laughs] I&#8217;m still running, and I&#8217;m going over here and give my auntie a bath here in just a little bit. It&#8217;s helping people. I&#8217;ll always do that until I die, I guess.  JF: When you look at your daughters&#8217; lives, what do you think is the biggest difference between your generation of women and their generation?  LC: Now, my girls are a little different because they&#8217;ve been raised up under their mother. My youngest daughter is more focused, not going to say a whole lot, but don&#8217;t step on something she believes in. Then she&#8217;s going to give it to you, calmly, and tell you what&#8217;s right and what&#8217;s wrong. She could be me. I could see her being me, I really could, if she was taught, because she knows what I believe in and what I stand for. She worked in a factory so she has that understanding. Now my oldest one, that&#8217;s a whole total different ballgame. These children are different as night and day. She&#8217;s more mouthy, half the time I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s talking about. She could stand up for rights but she&#8217;s not going to be out there too much. She was working at Walmart one time. I never will forget this. I didn&#8217;t tell her nothing. We went to Walmart, we were protesting against Walmart, we got all this stuff from the store and put it in buggies and left it, and we were outside marching around. So after it was over with and she got home she called me and she goes, &#8220;Mama?&#8221; I said, &#8220;What?&#8221; &#8220;Were you up there with them people outside? I told my girlfriend, I said, &#8216;I bet my mama&#8217;s out there. I&#8217;m going to lunch.&#8217;&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. Why?&#8221; &#8220;Mama, I work here.&#8221; I said, &#8220;They don&#8217;t know you from Adam, and I don&#8217;t care if they do.&#8221; [Laughs]   JF: [Laughs]  LC: She&#8217;s more that way but my youngest one, I believe if she had to she could take my place. She really could, but she&#8217;s more easy. That&#8217;s the way I was. She&#8217;s more easy but she listens and she teaches her son very well to be very disciplined and to do what&#8217;s right, but also to stand up for what&#8217;s right. I sometimes hear myself in her. He&#8217;s got to learn. He&#8217;s got to learn that he can have what he wants and be he wants to be, and I tell him that all the time. Because see my kids went to all white schools, they were the only blacks there, and they wanted to put my little one out and bus her somewhere, and the school just right down the street here, and I threw a whole cow. I went up there at that school and I mean I threw a fit. I said my kid&#8217;s going right here. She can walk to school and it&#8217;s right in her district. You&#8217;re not busing her nowhere. So my kids have been raised around blacks and whites because that&#8217;s the mixture of our family, my husband&#8217;s family, not mine, my husband&#8217;s family. Mine is more Indian. We&#8217;re coming from the Melungeon. We&#8217;re Melungeon. If you go to the history my grandmother is Melungeon. They have never been prejudiced because&#8212;they just haven&#8217;t. [Laughs] I didn&#8217;t raise them that way. So they take friends, even my daughter, she was married to a guy and he was white, and it&#8217;s just never been an issue in our household. And I thank God for that because people are people. They are people and nobody&#8217;s better than you, nobody&#8217;s better than me; we&#8217;re all just working for the same way, maybe a little different way of getting at it but we&#8217;re working to make life easier for everybody, to make a good life. That was my struggle, is to make a good life so that when my children got grown that they would not have to fight the same battles that I had to go through. That was my whole intent. I didn&#8217;t want my kids to grow up with that kind of life, going to work in a place where you didn&#8217;t have no rights and people treat you like a dog and talking down to you. No. No, I didn&#8217;t. [Pause] I wish everybody would do that. [Laughs] [Pause] Got anymore?  JF: Do you have anything else you want to add?   LC: No. I thank you.  JF: It&#8217;s been great.  LC: I&#8217;ve enjoyed this conversation. But y&#8217;all should see our videos.   JF: Yes. Do you have a copy of the PBS?  LC: The one I&#8217;ve got, I&#8217;ve got because we got the rights to the whole thing, and I think most of mine are out in the shed. Some of them are around here. I told Susan the other day. She said, &#8220;I believe, Luvernal, you have a copy of what I&#8217;m looking for.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know what she&#8217;s looking for. But I said, those videos&#8212;I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s just so many of them, but they put one together. TIRN should have one. Susan should have one.   JW: I&#8217;ll bet our librarian has the Nova series. I think I did actually see the PBS.  LC: On the PBS show?  JW: Yeah.  LC: Well see I did two on PBS. I done two about fair trade, about the workers and fair trade, for PBS, and then we had the documentary.  JW: Okay. I think I saw the fair trade one.  LC: Then we had the documentary where we took that trip to Mexico with that stupid plant manager.  JF: [Laughs]  LC: I ain&#8217;t never seen nothing as crazy.  JW: Is he the same one who&#8217;s in the&#8212;?  LC: Kokomo, Indiana?  JW: Is he in the Morristown film too?  LC: Yeah.  JW: Yeah, the one, yeah, the stupid one. [Laughs]  LC: [Laughs] Didn&#8217;t know how much his workers make. I tell you. You know Bill Haslam did me like that. When he was running for mayor. [Laughs] I bet he could have killed me. He was running for mayor, him and Madeline Rogero. They asked to come to our church, so they came to our church one Wednesday night, I think. We let one come one Wednesday and the next come the next Wednesday. I had my little pencil and my little paper, sitting on the front row. We was asking them different questions and stuff and I was just writing it down, you know. Didn&#8217;t have much to say. Then Brad [Rayson]called me and told me that we were going to bring them over to the union office, and when he walked in that door and he saw me sitting there, and he had to sit right beside me, he could&#8217;ve died. I said, &#8220;How much do you pay your workers?&#8221; He didn&#8217;t even know. I said, &#8220;You ain&#8217;t going to sit up there and tell me you don&#8217;t know how much you pay your workers. Don&#8217;t tell me that. Tell me the truth.&#8221; &#8220;Well I really don&#8217;t know how much they get paid.&#8221; I thought, oh lord. You want our vote and you don&#8217;t know&#8212;? [Laughs]  JW: Pilot Corporation &#8212;.   LC: I thought, get outta here.  JF: [Laughs]  LC: They tickle me when they try to cut around the question. I mean if you just answer the basic question: Well I don&#8217;t pay them much. I mean I pay them four dollars and such and such a thing, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d say. That&#8217;s all I can afford to pay. But they have good benefits for people at Pilot, they say. I don&#8217;t know. Never worked for them, never even explored it, don&#8217;t care. [Laughs] But I got tickled. It&#8217;s amazing.  JF: Well thank you so much, Ms. Clark.  LC: Thank you.  JF: This has been amazing.  LC: I hope it helps you some.  JF: Definitely. Thank you.
