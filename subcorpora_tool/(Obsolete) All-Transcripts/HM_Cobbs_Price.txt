Speaker 1: We were actually talking about your mother.  And I'd like you to give me her name and if you could tell us about her background.  And, you know, and where she grew up and that kind of thing.
Speaker 2: Sure.  My mother's name was Rosa Ellen Mashaw.  She was born in Birmingham at the turn of the century.  She went to Miles College [Fairfield, Alabama].  In those days it was a 'normal school' which was two years.  She was a schoolteacher in Birmingham, Alabama.  Met my father [Peter Price Cobbs] in Montgomery [Alabama].  I think she had gone to a teacher's convention. My father was a physician and had been at [then] Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] and had opened his office practice in Montgomery.  They met and married and moved to Los Angeles, California.  So I was born in Los Angeles and grew up there and lived there until I went off to school to [University of California] Berkeley.  Then the [U.S.] Army and then came back, finished and went to medical school.
Speaker 1: I want to go back to your mother.  And just can you tell me the origin of her name?  Do you know what the name is from?
Speaker 2: No.  As close as I can get, it was an Americanization of Micheaux, E-A-U-X, or something like that.  When I first wrote a book--my mother was alive at that time.  Somebody wrote me from New England and it was--the person was asking me about the origin of the name.  And whoever wrote it, his story jibed with my mother's story about it.  I think she said it was a French sea captain who had come to Mobile [Alabama] as I recall.  And maybe settled in Alabama.  And as with most of our names I am certain it was, you know, some name that was from the plantation owner or whomever.  But as far as I know it was an anglicized version of a French name Micheaux, Macheaux or something like that.
Speaker 1: (Off camera discussion)
Speaker 2: So did she share with you sir any of her stories of her growing up?
Speaker 1: Some.  She shared more about her growing up than my father did.  She was from a ministerial family.  In those days known as Colored Methodist Episcopal Church changed to Christian Methodist, I think, in 1954.  Her father was a minister and a presiding elder.  And several of her brothers were ministers and had become presiding elders.  The only brother whom I knew was Sam Mashaw, who was in Birmingham and later became a presiding elder.  And I think he was head of the supreme court of the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, whatever their judiciary body was.  And so she talked about growing up in Birmingham.  She talked about the segregation.  I don't think she had ever seen any lynchings, but she, you know, was--both my parents were very sensitive to politically sophisticated, particularly for the times.  So she--I remember my mother talking with me about as she grew up most of the trades were black.  She said if your house was being built, the electrician, the plumber, the carpenters--. And then she said as unions came in, even though the unions may not have been big in Birmingham, as they became trades for which people got more money, they became increasingly white.  And so since she left in 1925 she would have been describing a period I'm certain are the teens and the early '20s [1920s] of the century.  And, you know, she would talk about the South as a culture.  My mother would refer as we grew up in Los Angeles, she would refer to Birmingham, and she and my father would refer to the South as 'the old country.'  Almost as immigrants from Ireland or Italy would refer--their grandparents might refer to where they came from as 'the old country.'  My mother would refer to the South as 'the old country.'
Story_ID: 5328
Speaker 1: And your father, what about his name?  And, you know--.
Speaker 2: Okay.  My father was Peter Price Cobbs.  He was born in Barboursville, Virginia.  And went to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], finished in 1910, finished medical school in 19--no, wait just a minute, no.  Finished college in 1914, finished medical school in 1918.  And went to--I think he interned at [then]Tuskegee [Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama] and did part of a surgical residency there.  In those days there was really only one or two or three places that you could do any kind of residency.  Practiced briefly in Montgomery [Alabama].  And then in 1925 when he and my mother married they drove out to Los Angeles [California].  My father was very atypical for his times.  He was very political.  Let's, you know--we were mentioning [Augustus] Gus Hawkins earlier.  My father and Gus Hawkins were very close.  My father was a left-winger.  He was involved in very left-winged politics when the 'Red Scare' [fear of Communists overthrowing the U.S. government] came up in the '50s [1950s], the [U.S. Senator Joseph] McCarthy era, my father would have been one of the people who was named.  I don't think he ever was far enough left to carry a card.  But his politics were always very progressive.  He looked at the world through political lens among other things, gave me a very sensitive appreciation of politics.  He in the use of the word then, my father was a 'race man'.  It now--when people say race man it's much more nice nationalistic than it was then.  Because he certainly was very integrated.  He was involved in--with all kind of groups where he, you know, might be one or two or three people in that group.  But was very active, spoke out on things.  I remember at the time of Pearl Harbor [Hawaii] when the Japanese were taken away with executive order 9--I've forgotten the name of the executive--9066 [authorized internment of Japanese American citizens in 1942], I think, is the executive order.  I remember my father wanting to organize picket lines, writing letters.  There would be so many things.  I remember walking with my father when I was probably--I'm almost positive it would be before I was in junior high school.  So it was elementary school.  Walking in a picket line, "Don't spend your money where you can't work."  So my background--I really have a very fortunate background and a very privileged background, not in the economic sense, but a very privileged background in the sense of having a world view that--growing up with a worldview that was kind of beyond your block, your neighborhood, your community.  Remember meeting--as I grew up I met [author, educator, and activist] Dr. W. E. B. [William Edward Burghardt] DuBois as a teenager.  He came to Los Angeles. I've forgotten what the occasion was.  And my father took me and we had lunch with him.  Remember meeting Paul Robeson [actor], who was there I think with 'Othello' and various people.  I remember meeting, as a kid, Adam Clayton Powell Sr., not junior, who was the pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church.  I remember going to speeches of Adam Clayton Powell Jr., when I guess he was a city councilman getting ready to run for [U.S.] Congress in New York.
Speaker 1: Now did--you know, did your father--do you know what formed your father?  What were some of the things that made him like he was?
Speaker 2: I just--I really don't.  I constantly thought about that.  I don't know.  As with so many people, particularly men of his generation, he would talk about his background but only up to a certain point.  I never knew that much about what it was like growing up.  I might have known something about being in medical school.  I certainly knew something about him being in Tuskegee.  But early life.  What shaped him, what formed him, I don't know.  I do know one story that he told me of he wanted to leave Montgomery [Alabama].  And he interviewed for a job in Tallahassee [Florida]  So it would have been Florida A&M [Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, Tallahassee, Florida].  And I think in those days they called it infirmary. So he would--he was interviewing to be the infirmary physician.  And for one of the few times I remember him using the word, "How racist it was.  How prejudiced it was."  So this would've been Tallahassee of the mid '20s [1920s].  And, you know, I remember him--he was a very controlled person--I remember him being very emotional, "It was just a hateful town.  It was a very racist town."  And that's then, I think, when he decided he would come out--pardon me, he and my mother would move to Los Angeles.
Story_ID: 5329
Speaker 1: And do you know how they [Peter Price Cobb and Rosa Ellen Mashaw Cobbs] chose Los Angeles [California]?
Speaker 2: No.  In the time that I grew up, the '30s [1930s] Los Angeles was thought of as the promised land.  I would hear--if I wouldn't hear it in my home, it would be part of the small middle-class black community of that time.  Everybody for the most part was from someplace else.  Invariably from the South.  And they would tend to be people, I am certain, who were leaving the South in the '20s [1920s], in the '30s [1930s], because among other things, they couldn't tolerate the rigid segregation, the jumping off of sidewalks.  And a lot of this you would just get in bits and snatches as you listened to the parents of your friends or somebody at church or a visiting, minister would come to the church and be talking about he was from Memphis [Tennessee] or Dallas [Texas] or Birmingham [Alabama].  So, you know, just--my guess is Los Angeles because it was considered the promised land.  Also I know my father could get reciprocity.  He had a medical license in Alabama and he could get reciprocity and have a medical license in California.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now how old were you when your family moved to Los Angeles?
Speaker 2: I was born in Los Angeles.
Speaker 1: You were born--Oh that's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You did say that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year they moved here?
Speaker 2: '25 [1925].
Speaker 1: '25 [1925].
Speaker 2: Yeah to Los Angeles.  Right.
Story_ID: 5330
Speaker 1: Now what is your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: My earliest memory is when I was three years old.  I remember saying to somebody in the neighborhood, "I'm three years old."  What the context of it, I don't know.  But that would be my earliest memory.  Then we lived then on 51st Street. Fifty-first or 52nd [Street] and we moved to Trinity Street [in Los Angeles, California].  I think before I was four years old.  And I remember that very vividly.  And then the summer when I was five years old, 1934, we went on a trip.  We went on a trip to visit the relatives.  And in those days you could not stay anywhere.  So driving from Los Angeles [California], we went to Birmingham [Alabama], we went to Virginia, we came back through Ohio and then back to California.  And very carefully planned out, because, you know, you would drive eight hours a day and stay with some previously arranged either friend of the family, friend of a friend, contact of a minister, some fellow physician that my father knew.  And that I remember vividly.  Because we had a driver which would have been very atypical for the times, and not as highfalutin as it sounds.  In the sense that, you know, as a physician my father had patients.  So that, and in many ways people a lot of times didn't pay money, they bartered.  I can remember every now and then we'd have huge bags of peanuts.  Because somebody worked in a place that they had peanuts.  And I would realize, "Oh my father got paid in peanuts."  So the guy who drove us was a patient of my father's.  And I have--you know, what the financial arrangements were I don't know.  But why I say not highfalutin, because my father had to stay there and work to finance this trip, I know.  And there were three of us.  A brother [Prince Roland Cobbs]--I was the youngest.  A brother and a sister [Marceline Cobbs].  And so that trip I remember very, very, very vividly.  It was just so exciting.  You know, just sitting in the car and watching the land go by.  And, you know, we went the southern route. I remember, you know, huge stretches of desert.  I remember visiting my uncle in Birmingham or close to Birmingham.  And they were do--they were refining sugarcane.  I remember these boiling vats.  I remember going to Barboursville [Virginia].  And it was the first and only time I saw any of my grandparents.  All but my grandfather was dead at that point.  And I remember him as a blind man sitting under a tree.  This was 1934.  And it wasn't until I was in my sixties when I went back to Barboursville that I realized he'd been a slave.  You know.  You know, that he was in his eighties in 1934.  So he obviously was born before any--and he was in Virginia.  And you know, when you talk about much conversation, had he been free, I'm positive I would have heard that.  Because you would hear that in different people's families.  "Oh we're from free blacks."  Or, you know.  So that I would be positive.  But it never came up.  And, you know, you prefaced it with, asked me about my, you know, what my father said.  So that there's just a whole part of history, both his, what went before, what went before then--his grandparents, that I know absolutely nothing about.  I'm, you know, doing some Internet research.  I'm writing a memoir now. So I'm, you know, very much in touch with, you know, trying to get in touch with some of these things.
Story_ID: 5331
Speaker 1: Your siblings. Can you give their names and the order.
Speaker 2: Sure.  I have--my oldest brother is Prince Roland. P-R-I-N-C-E, R-O-L-A-N-D.  Prince was born in 1925, February.  That's a year after my folks came to L.A. [Los Angeles, California] in '24 [1924] and Prince is still alive and has retired and lives in Las Vegas [Nevada].  My sister Marceline was born in 1927, January of 1927.  And she died about seven years ago.  She was--Prince retired as a probation officer.  And my sister had been a schoolteacher and then a magazine editor for one of the McGraw-Hill [Companies] publications.  And both of them lived most of their lives in L.A.  My brother had been a merchant seaman for a while and--when he didn't live in L.A.  But they stayed in L.A.  I was the only one who really moved away.
Speaker 1: Now what was life like, family life like, you know, in your early years?
Speaker 2: Pleasant.  I don't have a--you know, particularly as a psychiatrist, you know, you're used to listening to people talk about the stresses and strains of childhood.  You know, I certainly had my share of arguments with parents or rebellions.  But in general very benign.  We had a very benign life.  We were not rich--it was the [Great] Depression, but if you had a car and a home.  And by the time I was, you know, headed into junior high school we had two cars.  We took summer vacations.  The best way I would describe it would be benign.  Clearly aware of race--that race would be discussed.  What you could do, what you couldn't do.  What not to let get in your way.  Lynchings would occur--I'd know about that.  We took the 'Pittsburgh Courier' and the 'Chicago Defender'--were both national papers in those days, so you'd read those weekly.  And those would keep you kind of appraised of what was going on with other blacks or other black communities around the country.  But best way I could describe it would be benign.  That by being away from relatives that all the relatives were back East.  And unlike today's world where, you know, I have a daughter in New Haven [Connecticut] and I talk to her twice a day sometimes.  She's well grown.  In those days you didn't use the phone that much.  So that if the phone rang and it was a relative, they would be announcing the death of somebody or some important family event.  So I would know the names, but I really didn't know the people.  I didn't meet any cousins until World War II, when people would pass through Los Angeles [California] who had been drafted and were on their way overseas or things like that.  Very kind of small middle-class black community that we did about the same thing within the rigors of segregation, because I don't wanna act as if--I'm not one of those people who likes to rewrite or romanticize history. Very aware that we were segregated, even in Los Angeles.  There were places you could go and not go.  There were neighborhoods you could go in and not go in. There were working-class communities that were kind of south and east of L.A. that you weren't to go in.  So that, within the confines of that group benign and tranquil.  But my parents as well as the parents of my peers spent an inordinate amount of time, I am certain, protecting us.  Keeping the harsh edges of racism from touching us.  Because almost to a person of the kids I grew up with, their parents were from the South.  And I say, you know, as you would sit and talk or listen to them talk, much more family gatherings as I grew up.  Socializing would be our family, mother [Rosa Ellen Mashaw], father [Peter Price Cobbs], three kids going to visit someone else who had kids or didn't have kids after church.  So that you, you know, much more conversation.  You know, pre-TV--radio was around.  But, you know, I was very--always a curious kid.  So I was just always very aware of listening to people talk.  Putting together what they were saying, why they were saying it, you know, long before I ever thought I would be a psychiatrist or a writer.
Story_ID: 5332
Speaker 1: This is conjecture--it's really a conjecture question.  But do you think your parents [Peter Price Cobbs and Rosa Ellen Mashaw Cobbs] were disappointed?  Or your father, that they were disappointed by what they found out here in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]?
Speaker 2: I don't think so.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't think so because it think the contrast was so great and I liken so much of what we have gone through in my lifetime to a peeling of the onion. So that a lot of the more subtle forms--and, you know, not subtle, subtle but less direct. More indirect forms of prejudice and segregation were not as marked as in the South.  So that I think just the contrast gave them elements of euphoria for a while.  Then as reality set in, you just kind of learned to cope with it.  But I think there would always be this feeling of, "Well we escaped something,"  okay.  Then as time went on, then you realize you hadn't really escaped that much.  You know, it was interesting.  My father as I grew up used to say that one reason the L.A. police department was so bad was that they recruited a lot of people from the South.  And I just thought that this was something that my father would talk about.  I, you know, I didn't, know that--didn't think of it necessarily as factual.  When my kids were little and--by then I was married.  My then wife was from Savannah [Georgia], and we were driving to Savannah.  We stopped in Auburn, Alabama, 1968, as I recall. And a guy was pumping gas.  He said, "Where are you from?"  I said we're from, then San Francisco [California].  "From San Francisco."  "Oh really?  Oh I lived in Los Angeles for a long time.  I was a cop out there." And I--you know, it clicked in, "My father was right," you know.  So no, I don't think, I don't think they were disappointed, but clearly realistic.  They enjoyed what they had, enjoyed life.  But I don't think that they were ever--they were never in the school of thought that either denied or ignored what was going on.  You know, it was there--you identified it, you recognized it, you grapple with it, you dealt with it, but you clearly didn't close your eyes and ignore it.
Story_ID: 5333
Speaker 1: If you take yourself back, I'm wondering what sights, sounds and smells or smells reminding you of your childhood growing up there?
Speaker 2: Whenever it rains, I think of my childhood.  What the associations are I don't know because it didn't rain that much in L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--it rained, but not that much.  Smell would be the ocean.  I loved being--we didn't live close to the ocean.  But we would drive to it.  And did not live close in that we lived maybe in those days fifteen or twenty miles.  Which in today's world of freeways is probably fifteen to twenty minutes--in those days it might have been an hour or so.  But I clearly when I smell the ocean that is something.  And then just driving in general. My father [Peter Price Cobbs] loved the outdoors and loved California.  And since there was not much money, outings were to pack a picnic lunch and get in the car and just drive.  If it was spring we'd drive to see the wild flowers.  If it was fall, we might drive just to drive because the colors didn't change as dramatically as they do in the east or the northeast.  So those would be the kind of sights and smells and sounds.
Story_ID: 5334
Speaker 1: Give me your schools that you went to?
Speaker 2: Okay.  By name?
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Starting with elementary.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I went to Trinity [Street] Elementary School [Los Angeles, California].  I lived on Trinity Street, so it was really a block from my home.  Went to John Adams Junior High School [later John Adams Middle School, Los Angeles, California] at 30th [Street] and Main [Street] in Los Angeles.  Went to [Thomas] Jefferson High School [Los Angeles, California].  It was 41st [Street]  and Hooper [Avenue].  Went to UCLA [University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California] right out of high school.  Then after a couple of years I transferred from UCLA to University of California, Berkeley [Berkeley, California].  And I stayed there, was drafted.  Went into the [U.S.] Army, went overseas to Germany.  When I came back and got my discharge I went back to [University of California] Berkeley and got my degree.  Then I went to Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee from 1954 to 1958.  I did my psychiatric training two years at Mendocino State Hospital [Talmage, California], which is north of here in Mendocino County.  Beautiful part of California.  And the last year at Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute which is the psychiatric part of University of California-San Francisco [San Francisco, California].  And I finished my training in 1962 and got my board certification in 1966.

Speaker 1: You told me you were a curious child.
Speaker 2: Always.
Speaker 1: And I'm just wondering how that sort of actualized itself?  And what were you curious about?  And what sort of interested you then?
Speaker 2: Did a lot of reading.  Was curious about the life beyond me.  I remember reading [Ernest] Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos.  Remember reading Langston Hughes.  Remember reading Booker T. Washington's 'Up from Slavery'--and these would not be assigned readings--just reading.  We took 'Time' magazine, and I would kind of--even as an elementary school kid--wait for 'Time' so that I could read it.  Just, you know.  Just curious about what life was like in other places.  "What's it like to live in Chicago [Illinois]?"  You know, and reading the 'Chicago Defender' [newspaper].  "What's Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania] like?"  I'm reading the 'Pittsburgh Courier' [newspaper].  I always knew something about Harlem, New York.  "What's life like?"  I remember in 1941 going--I was twelve years old---going to a--let's see, I guess I was thirteen--going to a play.  It was a musical, 'Jump for Joy,' Duke Ellington [composer/musician]--and just intrigued with Duke Ellington.  You know, just matinee idol handsome, suave, urbane--used words that I hadn't heard.  But just a certain way of bantering with the audience that was just new, you know.  So that that would send me off in another direction.  So just really curious.  Curious about blacks and whites--relationships.  Curious about, you know, kind of how we got here.  Didn't do as much historical reading as I did later on.  But just, you know.  Just, you know, I'd say kind of curious more about people--people's motivations.  What makes people like they are.  As with so many black folks grew up and my mother was very religious, so grew up in the church.  Now there I do remember arguments because I would challenge things from the church.  And my mother would not countenance such challenges (laughs) you know.  So it would be if I would ask her--and I would know when I was asking her a question that would get out on that thin ice, that either she didn't have an answer or she couldn't quite--she'd say, "Well so-and-so--I'm your mother, boy." (laughs)  So that's what I mean by curious.
Story_ID: 5336
Speaker 1: Were there things influencing you outside your family much--?
Speaker 2: Music.  I was never a musician.  I was always aware of jazz as--I wouldn't've used the words then--but as an art form, as an expression of black culture.  You know, so that would be curious and influence beyond my family.  [Los Angeles, California Mayor] Tom Bradley was one of the older guys as I grew up.  So [Thomas] Tom Bradley would have been--wouldn't have used the word role model then, but very, very much a role model.  His--he was a Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity].  And his job was to meet kids in junior high school and high school and try to influence them to go to college.  And so that many of us knew Tom long before he ever went into politics, and don't forget it's a very small community.  So that you just kind of knew people.  [Charles] Charlie Mingus the bassist was somebody I remember--Charlie Mingus probably--not probably first marriage.  He may have married four or five times after that.  I remember Charlie Mingus married [Camilla] Jeanne Gross in our church when I was probably at junior high school [John Adams Middle School, Los Angeles, California].  Dexter Gordon was a saxophonist.  He was from Los Angeles.  Dexter I was always interested in, because Dexter also was the son of a physician.  You know, so that I identified very much with that. There are clearly teachers I can think of--a teacher Miss Jensen (ph.).  A white haired kind of white lady. I  always looked on.  Miss Jensen could have been thirty-eight or forty.  But, you know, my image of her is like a woman in her late fifties or early sixties who was an English teacher.  Very influential in getting me to write.  And in those days UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles] had a--I guess they still--University of California system had Subject  A [a writing proficiency examination], and you had to take a test.  And if you passed Subject A you could just take regular English.  If you didn't pass Subject A you had to take some kind of remedial English.  Well, this was a predominantly black high school, and Miss Jensen was determined that the few of us who were gonna go to any of the UC [University of California colleges]--go to college in general, but particularly the UC system were gonna pass Subject A.  So we--I passed Subject A.  Miss Speck was a geometry teacher--in those days when I went to school, I had my first black teacher, who was a music appreciation teacher, I think, when I was in high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California].  So that most of the teachers--even though the black community was gradually growing, and particularly by the time I finished high school, the black community had grown 'cause the war [World War II] was on then. But most of the teachers I had were white, and I was clearly influenced by many of them.  My--a lot of interesting people in and out of the house or as we went to different places.  So that, you know, there would be a fair number of people that I could say clearly made some impact--I thought about, may have picked up something based on what they said.  Including may have picked up a book that would have been some type of impact and influence in my life.
Story_ID: 5337
Speaker 1: Were you a typical younger child?
Speaker 2: What's a typical younger child?
Speaker 1: (Laughs) Okay.  Well by the time the younger child gets--comes there, the parents are a little, you know, looser with their--I mean were you--were you the baby of the family?
Speaker 2: Pretty much, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  More with my mother [Rosa Ellen Mashaw Cobbs] than with my father [Peter Price Cobbs].  My father was pretty tough on all of us--and not tough in a mean sense, but, you know, "You're gonna go to college."  He--initially all three of us were gonna be doctors--I was the only one who ended up as a physician.  My mother, yeah, I was--and now that I'm in my seventies I could say, yes, I was her favorite.  And she kind of acknowledge it as she was dying.  She, you know--we were--"I love you all the same," you know--and I'm sure she did.  But I was probably the most rebellious and obstreperous--was able to channel it fairly well.  And I also knew at a fairly early age--with both my parents, but specifically with my mother--I knew I was interesting to my mother because she would like to talk with me about things that I did, or people that I met or--and that persisted until she died when she was eighty-nine, you know, that was--one of the things I've always over the last twenty-five or thirty years done a lot of travel.  And so I would always call my mother to tell her where I was.  And she would ask me, "Well tell me what--I hear Chicago [Illinois] is very cold.  It's now March.  Is it cold there?"  "No Mother, it's March 26.  It's relatively warm."  "Oh okay."  "Now tell me.  I read something about the 'el' [elevated railway].  What is the el?"  You know.  And that was really a pattern that started when I was really very, very young.  So just--you know, I was aware of having a certain kind of latitude--sometimes to my detriment because I floated in and out of being a good serious student.  I really didn't become a serious student until I came back from the [U.S.] Army.  And I had been first a private and then a corporal in the Army which meant that, you know, you were bossed around by everybody.  And when I got out of the Army I was determined, I might be bossed around by somebody, but I was gonna at least make it fewer rather than more.  So I became a much more serious student.  But, you know, it's interesting when you reflect on things.  And there are things that you don't really reflect on and get in touch with until you get older, and all the emotional attachments, you know, with both--if my brother [Prince Roland Cobbs] and sister [Marceline Cobbs] were sitting here and we were in our thirties, I'd feel silly saying, "Oh I know I'm my mother's favorite."  You know, because it would--it would be unseemly.  It would be--in some way it would be impacting them.  Where as now I can say it, because I'm certain she loved them as much as she loved me--we're just three different people, three different personalities--three different ways of impacting.  I spent more time with my mother as the only child--pardon me as the youngest child.  And it wasn't that our ages were that far apart.  But I remember, prior to going to school going to the beauty parlor with her, you know, so I'd sit in the beauty parlor.  You talked about smells--I remember the smells, because in those days they were frying hair (laughs), you know.  And I can remember those smells.  I remember some of the ladies that she would see.  Being in that kind of small, tight middle-class community, there were a lot of clubs.  So my mother was in the PhysArtLitMor Club--Physical culture, Art, Literature and I think the Mor was morality, I'm not sure.  But PhysArtLitMor--and I guess it met once a month, and I remember sitting with that.  And then there might be some church club that my mother was in--she wasn't in a sorority.  And then later on when I was an adult and she was in--one of the Kappa [Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity] mothers with, you know, the various mothers.  So but--as a kid I spent a lot of--I spent a lot of time with her.
Story_ID: 5338
Speaker 1: As I got older, I spent alone time with my father [Peter Price Cobbs] because my brother [Prince Roland Cobbs] was off in the service.  I'd say high school [Thomas Jefferson High School, Los Angeles, California]--by then my brother was gone.  My sister [Marceline Cobbs] had gone off to Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], and I do remember spending a fair amount of time with my father.  My mother [Rosa Ellen Mashaw Cobbs] and I were closer.  Among other things, 'cause she lived thirty years after my father died.  Once I finished medical school [Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee], there had been turbulence between my father and myself, but that diminished.  But my father died within a year and a half after I finished medical school, so I never really had the kind of adult relationship--there were questions I wanted to ask, you know, just as you are asking.  Where did you get, you know--what you--what informed your political view?  'Cause even at an early age I was very aware it was atypical. It was different for the times.  He was out there.  You know, I mean he was in the paper.  He was, you know. He was raising some radical cry.  He was off to a picket line.  There were people that I knew he knew whose names, particularly as he started naming names, whose names were in the paper.
Speaker 2: Now you said that you had a--in relationship to your father.  You said it was--.
Speaker 1: Turbulent.
Speaker 2: Turbulent.  When did that start?  Was that young and then into--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Probably high school college.  When I started college I didn't do very well.
Speaker 2: So he was disappointed.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Disappointed--angry.  Among other things.  Because not doing well was not so much I was there applying myself and it wasn't there.  You know.  I discovered girls, you know, I was doing the things that seventeen, eighteen, nineteen year olds do in--and also I had a very personally unique experience of--I started college at UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles] in 1946. It was--UCLA had gone from a sleepy six or seven thousand to eighteen or twenty thousand in one year because the GI Bill [education benefit program for veterans].  So that many of the guys that were there that you knew--and there was kind of a small cadre of, you know, I'm gonna ask somebody.  Not over a hundred blacks.  Maybe not over fifty or seventy-five.  But the guys were all returning veterans, so they were older.  So that you were trying to keep up with.  And, you know.  You thought you were cool, you know.  You wanted to be bad. You thought you were making it with some guy who's twenty-four, twenty-five--there were three or four guys who had been Tuskegee Airmen.  So, you know, again I didn't know it at the time, but all of that I'm certain impacted, you know, that--rather than trying to keep up with the Joneses, I was trying to keep up with Joe and Sam who were twenty-four, twenty-five and in a much different state.  They knew what they wanted, 'cause they had been in the service.  Some of 'em were married.  But, you know,  I got it together.  And that would have been one--my father was also anti-fraternity.  And when I got into the Kappas [Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity] he liked it and he didn't like it.  He liked it because it, you know, it was part of the fabric.  He didn't like it because I think he thought that it was something that was gonna impact me negatively in terms of scholarship. I couldn't put it on the fraternity.  It was just growing pains and, you know, trying to figure out who you are and what you are.  And, you know, by then the racial wars are going on in my head.  I--you know.  Things were making me angry, you know.  Little slights that might have been, kind of minor.  The older I got, the more I realized where the--that I was assigned to some kind of category that I didn't like.  And I think all of that kind of netted.  You know.  So no, I can remember some fairly marked arguments.  Never anything physical or violent, but you know, I can remember--so it was turbulent and not--it never reached a point where so many times I hear younger people describe that period where they view their parent or parents as kind of irrational, you know. "They're trying to impose things on me with--," I never got to that point.  I knew what he was pissed off about.  You know.  I didn't have a problem figuring out what he was pissed off about.  I just wasn't--you know, it wasn't so much willfully not doing it, I just--I just was at a stage where I was exploring and trying to understand things.  And trying to put it together, trying to figure out what all this life was gonna mean for me.

Speaker 1: What were you majoring in at that time?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Pre-Med.
Speaker 1: Oh.  So you were--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So you weren't--it was just that--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: You were on track.  Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) yeah.  Pre-Med.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that, you know, things like economics, history are two things that--history specifically when [Dr. William] Bill Grier and I were writing 'Black Rage' and we were doing some historical reading, I realized that had been such a lack in my background. I had not really read much history, you know, that there's a sweep in putting things together.  Let you understand with--where you came from.  Not only as a black person, as an American, as a world citizen.  That was one.  And the other was business and economics.  That I knew nothing about.  I thought I did, you know, but I really didn't know that much.  Those were things that I had never taken 'cause I was really focused on pre-med.  The one thing that I did take, I took English and English Lit [literature] classes and writing classes, I remember at Berkeley [University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  And, you know, those kind of contributed to a view beyond, you know, that kind of narrow focus of being a premed major and then a medical school major.
Speaker 1: Now how did you choose?  You started out at UC--.
Speaker 2: LA [Los Angeles].
Speaker 1: UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles] and then went to UC [University of California] Berkeley.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  And then transferred to UC Berkeley.
Speaker 1: Now what was the reason for that?
Speaker 2: Wanted to get away from home, hadn't done well.  A very good friend of mine--in fact, we've been friends for sixty years.  Byron had come up here.  He had--Byron and I had known each other--had gone to school together in junior high school [John Adams Middle School, Los Angeles]--went to different high schools.  And he had gone to a community college and then come up to Berkeley, and I went to UCLA and it was a Methodist co-op.  And so Byron and I probably drove up here, saw it, decided I would come--and it fit.  I wanted to get away from home, kind of wanted to be on my own.  Wanted to, you know, test my wings away from hearth and home.  And that I do remember being in Berkeley--twenty, twenty-one.  And I remember just walking around at one or two or three o'clock in the morning just to be walking because there was nobody to tell you to come home and go to bed, you know.  Just the sheer glee and exhilaration that you--you know, I just wanted to shout,  "I'm an adult.  It's two [A.M.] and I'm walking around." (laughs) You know.
Speaker 1: That sense of freedom.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Exactly.  You know.  I mean it's--as you get older it's--you realized you were quite as free as you thought you were, but you know.  It's nothing like being twenty or twenty-one and thinking you're free anyway.
Story_ID: 5340
Speaker 1: What year were you in school when you got drafted?  Were you finished at that point?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No, no.  I was twenty-one and I had not.  I had maybe ten or fifteen credits more.  I could have gotten out of the draft because I was a student [at University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California].  I could have gotten a student deferment.  I made a conscious choice to let myself be drafted for some healthy reasons and for some very neurotic reasons.  One neurotic reason was I thought I could get the GI Bill [Federal funding to veterans for educational purposes], and since my father [Peter Price Cobbs] and I were fighting, I would never have to use his money again.  Of course, I used his money while I was in the [U.S.] Army and I used it when I got out.  But, you know.  And then the other was I had a conscious feeling around patriotism.  One of the ways--my politics were left.  And one of the ways that left-wingers would get pillared would be, "You're unpatriotic."  And I wanted to go in the [U.S.] Army, because I said, "That's one card that would never be played on me."  You know, that I am--because it was easy, you just sign a form, and that was pre-Vietnam--this was Korea.  You know, then Vietnam is was just rife that, you know--in fact now, the people who are the biggest patriots are invariably those who were able to figure out a theological deferring or something.  So those were kind of the two--and then just, you know, that kind of post-adolescent confusion, and I didn't regret it.  I learned a lot in the Army--I was in the tail-end of the segregated Army.  So I was with all-black troops with white officers.  Initially it was a [U.S.] National Guard unit and we had black officers.  It was from L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  And I happened to join it, I wasn't in the National Guard.  Then when we went overseas, we were a black unit with white officers.  And it--you know, even now as I look back on it, it was that whole panoply of feelings.  Part of it was just ridiculous and ludicrous because I was a company clerk.  So I typed the passes and I knew, you know--I was a secretary, so I knew people stuff.  So you would see people who were officers who had been in the National Guard who were dumb as they could possibly be.  You could hear racist comments.  We were over in Germany, and clearly had some fun. Since I was a company clerk--and a friend of mine Frank Qualls--who recently died--Frank lived up the street from me and we coincidently ended up in the same organization--Frank was the finance guy for the unit.  He would take the--whatever, all the little slips of paper.  I was the company clerk.  So we could type passes for ourselves, get a jeep, put on our civilian clothes.  We'd just drive around in Germany--so I saw a lot of Germany.  Went to Switzerland--went to Lucerne, went to Zurich.  Also went to Copenhagen [Denmark].  So that, you know, I was a kind of--I was a college student in the Army. I knew I wasn't gonna stay in the Army.  And so it was great.  It also let me see the stratification of life.  Of, you know, how some people are over other people.  And so I saw very few black officers when I went overseas.  I'm certain they were around.  I knew some, you know, from home.  But they were not a part of my life.  Just as I was leaving to come back--this would have been the latter part of 1952--my outfit was desegregating, you know.  [U.S. President Harry S.] Truman had signed the desegregation--I think, in '48 [1948], '49 [1949], I'm not certain.  But just as I was leaving it was--you know, my particular unit, you know, as with so many things--maybe we were among the last units to desegregate.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So the Army in many ways was good for you.
Speaker 2: Yeah, no question.
Speaker 1: I mean from a--it allowed you--you saw the world.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Saw the world, yeah.
Speaker 1: This was the first time.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Like that.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What do you think?  Do you think there are other things besides the fact that you--it got you on the straight and narrow, that you didn't want to--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well I don't know that I would describe (laughs) it as the straight and narrow.
Speaker 1: Well you said, "You didn't wanna be the low person on the totem pole."
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No.
Speaker 1: That's what I meant.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) No.
Speaker 1: (laughs) And then also, you know, it allowed you to sort of see the world in a--and I just, you know--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.  It also allowed me to get in touch with my intellect.  You know.  As I said, here I was a clerk, black.  The officers were white.  I was not intimidated by them, but it allowed me to see that rank didn't confer intelligence.  'Cause I saw some Army officers who were dumb as sin.  I also saw some guys that I liked, that were decent.  And by being the clerk, I was privy to their little conversations.  So that, you know, I would hear things.  I would hear racist comments, you know. It would almost be like somebody, "Oh my God!  What did I do bad that I ended up being assigned to this unit?"  Then I might hear someone else who, "You know, these are my troops and, you know, whether they're white, black, blue or green, I'm gonna give it my best."  So it, you know, it gave me a more adult view of life.  And, you know, with all the things that people in their early twenties do.  You know, you're seeing different sights, different smells, different cultures, different kind of girls.  You know, the whole thing.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: So when you get--you spent how long two--was it two--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Two years in the Army, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 5341
Speaker 1: When you get out you have--you had your GI Bill [Federal funding to veterans for educational purposes].  Do you just--is that when you returned?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I went--when I got out I was back in school.  I got out in December.  I was back in school in February.  'Cause by then I knew I wanted to finish, you know.
Speaker 1: And you only had--you only had a few more credits.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  Right.  I did--I probably took a few credits in February.  I don't recall whether I went to summer school.  But I'd gotten my degree within two semesters.  And then when I got accepted into medical school I had to take one course at USC [University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California].  A chemistry course that was great, you know.  In fact, I wished I had gone to USC the whole time because it was so much, you know, I could master it so much easier than the course that I'd taken at [University of California] Berkeley that were very competitive.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now what was Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] like for you?  And why had you chosen--why had you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It's where I got accepted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'd gotten accepted there and a couple of other places.  I wanted to go there.  Different first experience with black education.  All black teachers--core of black teachers.  Although there were a lot of visiting professors from Vanderbilt [University, Nashville, Tennessee] and clinical professors from Vanderbilt.  There was an edge at Meharry that I had not experienced in education before.  There was a tension between the faculty and the students in ways that I was unaware of--and unaware of prior to that.  Some of the particularly pre-clinical years.  Physiology, anatomy, biochemistry, bacteriology.  You were taught by people who probably were failed doctors--who had not gone to medical school.  Now, and, you know, I wanna be clear--not--don't mean failed, weren't smart enough, whatever.  Just maybe didn't--family didn't have the money.  You know, whatever.  So that there was a certain kind of tension with the feeling that you're the chosen one.  "And you're gonna go out of here and make all this money.  And here I am stuck, you know, doing okay in the scheme of things, but certainly not making any money."  So but there was--there was a tension.  There was a--rather than in other places I always felt the instructors wanted you to pass.  There were sometimes at Meharry there would be a thing, you know, "You better be careful, I may flunk your ass out of here," you know.  So that I was very cautious.  There was a prejudice--I was very aware--if you were from L.A. [Los Angeles, California]--it was interesting.  My daughter later--you know, years later went to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia] and she felt the same thing about just being from California.  You know, that you--maybe you think your slick or this or that.  So I was, you know--I was--I hunkered down.  I was determined that I was not going to be a sitting or moving target for anybody.  So I wanted to, you know--I wanted to get in and out of medical school.  Part of this is probably, at that time, was exaggerated in my mind.  It may not have been quite as marked, but it was there, you know.  It was not--it was not something I conjured up or anything that I necessarily talked that much with other people about.
Story_ID: 5342
Speaker 1: ...Benign tranquil upbringing, but I use those words personally.  I don't use those words as if we were unaware, you know, that people got their butt beaten by the cops or that somebody's uncle had just come from Louisiana.  And somebody might have said, "Oh yeah, he came last Thursday. He tried on a shirt in a store in the department--" so you're very aware of stuff.  But our parents spent so much time at least trying to keep it from negatively impacting on us.  And I'm sure--in that way I know my parents were not alone.
Story_ID: 5343
Speaker 1: You were talking about sort of the tension at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee].  And I had thought maybe you had--sometimes people say that there is among the part of sometimes a black faculty a paternalistic sort of view of things.  You know, between the teacher and the students.
Speaker 2: Could--that could also be a part of it.  But because also in paternalism there can also be hostility, you know, I think people view paternalism as so benign--but, you know, that would be a part of it.  And that--it's a--it was the whole thought that this group of people--I think we started out with seventy-five people in our class--in those days much--it's different now--but in those days, top of the heap, economically.  Black physicians now kid themselves if they think they're the top of the heap economically, even within black culture, it's just not true, with HMOs [health maintenance organizations] and whatever--so that there was that.  You know that, you're kind of--"Gonna go out of here and make all this money.  And since I'm teaching you, I'm as smart or, you know, in the human scheme I'm much smarter than you are anyway."  And I would feel that.  Now again I--as I reflect on it, I am certainly mature enough to know part of the edges may have been exaggerated in my mind.  But the, but the--it was not made up, and you know, I--it was there.  And I'd say--I didn't talk about it with--that much with anyone.  But I would have no doubt if I talk with people they would feel it.  It was one of the things I think when--and I think it's probably now much, much, much different.  Was one of the reasons why specifically Meharry and black institutions in general--I think that was one of the barriers for fundraising.  Because a lot of times people would get out and they would say, "To hell with it.  I don't wanna send any money, you know, as hard a time as I had."  I think that has abated, and in fact, as I've talked with younger people the pendulum has swung the other way.  But that was one of the things.
Story_ID: 5344
Speaker 1: What are you thinking you want to do?  And you know, we never--and earlier, I never asked--you had talked about I think, an English teacher.  But you--in math and science had you had a proclivity towards those?  Those subjects?
Speaker 2: I could get through them.  Not necessarily pro--I wanted to be a psychiatrist.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Oh that's what I--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  I didn't--.
Speaker 1: But how--where did that come from?
Speaker 2: Reading [psychiatrist Sigmund] Freud.  You know, reading [author, educator, and activist William Edward Burghardt, W. E. B.] DuBois.  You know, just a bent of wanting to understand people.  I thought I could understand the racial strife better.  So it--in fact, I have a classmate--he died--Isaac Slaughter.  He became a psychiatrist and moved--was in Oakland [California].  And Isaac would say, "You know, many of us, you know, kind of maybe thought about it after internships."  Said, "Price is the only one I knew in medical school who said, 'I wanna be a psychiatrist.'"  You know.  And it's interesting.  Because from my father's time, in medicine, he wanted me to be a blood and guts physician.  He wanted me to be a surgeon or, you know, something that was a real doctor.  And I remember when I told him that I was going into psychiatry, he never said, you know--you know, what he really felt.  But I know--I knew him well enough, you know--he wanted, you know, he wanted me to be in the operating room or something where blood was flowing, you know.  I did have--I was kind of squeamish about blood anyway.  But I wanted to be a psychiatrist, yeah. I, I would say probably two or three determinants.  One was just always a proclivity and a curiosity about what makes people tick, you know, what--why do they do what they do?  You know, and that would be one.  That was literally from elementary school on, you know.  I can remember thinking that way about teachers, about fellow students, you know, from then on--and then reading. By then I had--and I would say a fair amount of Freud.  And then with some of the--some of the early Richard Wright.  Just again in particularly Bigger Thomas [main character in 'Native Son'].  You know, "What, what is this?"  And as with so many things, I also have no doubt that part of wanting to be a psychiatrist was to better understand myself, you know.  That now that would have been more--I would have been more aware of it afterwards.  But I don't have any doubt that that was, you know, as much a motivation as any.  You know, "I wanna understand--maybe this will help me understand a bit better who I am and what I'm about."
Story_ID: 5345
Speaker 1: You were the one in your class interested in psychiatry?
Speaker 2: At that time, but yeah, there were you know--there were four or five hundred black psychiatrists in the--oh, about 19--maybe three hundred or four hundred about 1970, '72 [1972], around the country.  So a handful.  But, you know, critical mass.  Then in the '60s [1960s] and '70s [1970s] a fair number of black physicians went into psychiatry, and I think for some of the reasons we're talking about. Trying to understand things, trying to understand themselves.  I don't know what the numbers are now.
Speaker 1: You know, when I try--you know, this is gonna sound somewhat like a naive question.  But, you know, in our community, psychiatry has always been accepted.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's true.
Speaker 1: And so I find it fascinating that you at the time--and, you know, when we interviewed Dr. [Alvin] Poussaint I thought--you know I--the first--the question was, "What did you think you were gonna do?"
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.  Because this is a community that--you know, where were you thinking
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You'd practice and all that at that time?
Speaker 2: I didn't--you know, I don't think I thought about where I was going to practice until you got closer to that time.  I made a conscious decision to come up to San Francisco [California] to intern rather than to intern in Los Angeles [California]. So I made a decision to be here.  I, you know, I knew I would--I would get black patients.  You know, I didn't--and I was very aware that, you know, I mean--"If you see a psychiatrist, you gotta be crazy," you know.  I mean very aware of cultural things that would keep it away.  But with every reaction, there's an equal and opposite reaction.  So while at the same time you have that it--you know, it would be if I could get somebody to sit in the office, I could get my hooks in them.  And by getting my hooks--just by listening--by conveying to them that, you know, "What you are telling me is important."  And not through any contrived--not through any acting, it would just be that so many people that I would see--and in those days, welfare mothers, on--nobody'd ever taken them and their story seriously.  Nobody'd ever sat down, you know, they had--most of their medical stuff had been in clinics.  You know, where, "Come here.  Come there."  They would--you know, people would describe sitting three or four hours waiting for somebody.  I would see a welfare mother, and would be someone who would say, "Man, you can't see welfare patients.  They'll never be on time."  And I would say to somebody, "I'm going to see you next Thursday and every Thursday at eleven o'clock [A.M.].  I will be on time.  If I'm not available at eleven o'clock [A.M.], you will know that I had an accident or something happened. But I will be on time."  And the next Thursday person might be there at eleven eight [11:08].  From then on, they were there at eleven o'clock just like any other patient.  Because they would know I was gonna be there.  So it wasn't that, you know, kind of self-fulfilling prophecy--"Well I'll come late.  Because whenever I see my doctor, you know, I have a three o'clock appointment.  I don't get in until 5:15 anyway."  And so that it just--you know, I guess there would have been levels of naivete around it. Or you're aware of something and you close your eyes.  But I never had any, I never had any sense that I wouldn't see patients--then don't forget also, I'm in San Francisco, so that a fair number of my patients are non-black.  You know, that--I laugh with a guy that when I first started in practice, I became fashionable.  You know, that it was--people were fashionable if they had a Japanese dentist and a black psychiatrist.  Well since I was the only psychiatrist in private practice they said--somebody would say,  "Man I heard your name at a party," you know.  You know it just--everything comes together.
Story_ID: 5346
Speaker 1: Is there any mentor for you?  Or anyone you can point to while you're at Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] to say--I mean anyone counseling you, or--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Not really.  You know, by then the whole drive is to get through and become a physician--get your M.D.  Those people who were interested in surgery--Matthew Walker--clearly he was a, you know, renowned surgeon at that time--would have been.  There was a guy who was a neuropsychiatrist--he was from one of the islands.  I've forgotten--very erudite, very urbane kind of guy, I remember him--I've forgotten his name.  There was a guy in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] a psychiatrist, Ellis Tony.  I think Ellis is still alive.  Ellis would probably be maybe eighty-five now, something like that.  I remember, you know, he came into L.A. probably maybe a few years before or around the time I went into medical school.  So that it just--the whole concept of role models as conscious is a more recent concept.  So yeah, there were role models, but you didn't think of them as such, you know, you just--you know, you borrowed this, you borrowed that, you read about this.  You know, just any number of things.
Speaker 1: So you come back.  And is that where you go--you said, Men--,
Speaker 2: Mendocino [State Hospital, Talmage, California].
Speaker 1: Mendocino. That's California.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  It's north of here.  Mendocino is beautiful part of Califor--part of the wine country is in Mendocino now--yeah.
Speaker 1: And then you said you went on to Langley--.
Speaker 2: Langley Porter [Neuropsychiatric Institute]--yeah.  That's the psychiatric--neuropsychiatric part of University of California San Francisco.  University of California San Francisco is the medical school campus.  It used to be that you took your first two years at [University of California at] Berkeley and finished the second two years over here.  Starting in the '50s [1950s] I think--yeah, I'm positive the '50s [1950s].  It became a full-fledged medical center campus.  And now it's a campus of health sciences--medicine, dentistry, nursing, pharmacy, allied health sciences of whatever sort.  So I finished my last year there.
Story_ID: 5347
Speaker 1: You didn't have any problem getting placed or anything [as a resident in medical school]?
Speaker 2: It was in the background--yeah, yeah.  No, there was--the one thing that I have always been aware of and that would be really from junior high school [John Adams Middle School, Los Angeles, California] on, I don't know.  I might have even started in elementary school [Trinity Street Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] although I wouldn't have used the words. That as a black person, as an African American there was always extra scrutiny.  And it didn't necessarily mean that, "Oh my God!  There's an added burden," sometimes it was, but there was just extra scrutiny.  And yeah, that would have been no more or less true when I was interviewing about a residency or this or that or the other.  You know, so that, no, it was--and it wasn't that all the barriers kept you out.  But I sure as hell was aware that there were barriers.  I remember it was an interview around a residency and the guy was asking me about drugs.  Now this was in 1958, so this was way before a real focus on drugs.  Okay.  One thing would say, "Oh you're being paranoid.  The guy was just ahead of his time.  You know. There were probably other young physicians who were on drugs."  That would be a misstatement. That--those--'cause I asked other people.  Those questions were reserved for me, you know, and I was aware of it.  You know, and so that you're aware of it.  So you know, you figure out responses. You figure out, you know, it's part of that built-in survival and mastery mechanism that any of us who have poked our head slightly above the water in whether we're doctor, lawyer or Indian chief have learned how to do.
Story_ID: 5348
Speaker 1: And so after that [after his last year of residency at Langley Porter Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of California, San Francisco], what are you--where do you go to work?
Speaker 2: After that I initially go to work at Napa [State Hospital, Napa, California]. I buy a home in Marin County [California] which is north of San Francisco [California] and it was in a place called Eichler Developments--this was in the early '60s [1960s].  And I specifically buy a home there because it's one of the few places that is openly wanting to be integrated.  So that unlike, here, Chicago [Illinois], any other place, if you went there, you could see a house.  They weren't gonna shut the demonstration, you know, the demonstration house down and say, "Oh no.  We're gone for the day."  So we moved in a place called Terra Linda--very modest homes.  And I had a part-time job at Napa State Hospital which was about forty miles away and I also had a private practice--starting a private practice in San Francisco.  It lasted for five or six months and it was just too much commuting.  So then I took a part-time job at San Francisco General Hospital [San Francisco, California] and a private practice.  And I built a private practice and then, probably in a couple of years I'd, I went on the continuing education faculty at University of California, San Francisco [San Francisco, California] and had a private practice.  And then I went full-time in private practice.
Story_ID: 5349
Speaker 1: When did you get married and--?
Speaker 2: I got married in Nashville, Tennessee in May of 1957. The end of my junior year.  My wife was teaching at Tennessee State [University, Nashville, Tennessee].  She was a PE [physical education] teacher at Tennessee State.  We had two children.  A boy who was born in 1958, a daughter who was born in 1959.  My wife died in 1973.  So I was widowed and had two, you know, teenage kids to raise, so that was, you know, very, very challenging, challenging part of my life.  First book had just come out, 'Black Rage,' then the second book, 'The Jesus Bag.'  I was becoming a national figure, asked to speak, exciting times--she comes down with cancer.  And, you know, it's just challenging, challenging, challenging times.  You know, with that kind of trauma, particularly with kids.  You either become very close or something gets botched and you're very estranged.  Well my kids and I are very close.  So, then I remarried and now have been married, it will be seventeen years in May.
Story_ID: 5350
Speaker 1: Let me tell you how I went about it [establishing his private psychiatric practice]--okay.  There were--there was a larger, more organized black community then than there is now.  I called on every black physician--met--or at least those that I could see--met, gave a card--I'm in practice.  Some I already knew or they certainly may have known of me, you know--that he was in training around here, whatever.  So that would be a source of referrals.  I had been in clinics.  So that was a source of referrals.  I had recently finished training at hospitals.  So that was a source of referrals.  I was moderately politically active.  So, you know, out of your social group that was a source of referrals.  And then as you get better and better-known patients refer.  But ultimately in, a specialty like psychiatry, your best referrals are your own patients.  The people who have seen and have felt that you have helped them.  You know.  Rather than they've, you know, they've spent a year and very little insurance money in those days.  I mean people are paying out of their own pocket. So that if they felt that they had gotten better, they'd tell somebody about you.  You know.  Or they'd send a family member.  So it's kind of concentric circles of referrals.
Speaker 2: And your patient base was what mixture in percentages?  Or--.
Speaker 1: Two-thirds women.  Maybe, maybe, 55 [percent]-45 [percent] black to white--55 white, 45 black.  And that might, you know, don't forget we're dealing with a small base.  So that might shift 55 black, 45 white.  But always a critical mass on both sides.  Yeah.
Speaker 2: And this is the--we're in the mid-'60s [1960s]?
Speaker 1: Yes.  That's correct.
Story_ID: 5351
Speaker 1: What is the nature of the problems, sir?  I mean, you know, things have changed a little bit.
Speaker 2: Everything.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Unlike the textbooks or the movies, people come to you out a variety of just everyday mundane problems.  "I'm not feeling well,  I just don't know what's going on."  "My marriage seems to be doing--going sour."  "I'm trying to raise my kids and I, you know, this--."  Every now and then you get somebody who might be fairly visibly disturbed--either severely neurotic or psychotic.  It was a time particularly for my black patients--it was a time of change where people wanted to explore what was going on with them--the social milieu much more explosive. So that people would come in and wanna talk with you about what it was like to be--I can think of a guy who was a painter on the Golden Gate Bridge [San Francisco, California].  What it--the only black painter, or one or two, what it was like to be a painter on the Golden Gate Bridge when you knew it was union.  They didn't want your ass there and that somebody would cut one of those cables and let you fall into the ocean to keep from being--to keep from having a black painter on the bridge, you know.  Tension, stress.  Somebody else might be just kind of old-fashioned depression.  But the transition had been--in my training I certainly saw black patients but it was rarely overt discussions about race and then what was going on with them internally.  As the '60s [1960s] evolved, I would talk more and more with people who would talk about what was going on with them racially and then how it might be impacting or not impacting other parts of their life so that you just began to talk more and more about what it meant to be black in the United States of America in San Francisco [California].  And, you know, and you would talk with people on the phone.  People would, you know,  I can think of somebody who didn't have the money, who would fly up from L.A. [Los Angeles, California] once a month just to wanna talk, you know.  So, you know, it's an interesting question.  But just people would come from a variety of sources.  And then as you get known, then people--and particularly, you're known around certain things.  Then, you know, I would get--I can think of a fair number of people who were interracially married while--and it would tend to be more, although not exclusively, white women, black men.  And sometimes black, you know, black woman, white man, but tend to be more--okay.  I sometimes would see the white spouse because she just didn't understand the anger that her husband felt--the rage that was, was there.  And I think so many people just trying to understand what's burning inside of me.  You know, "I just gotta get on top of it.  You know.  I just walk around every day with my jaws tight.  I'm pissed off all the time."  But, you know, that what had previous been unconscious, preconscious was now pouring into consciousness.
Story_ID: 5352
Speaker 1: Do you think it, a lot, your practice in being able to build a practice--you had a lot to do with the fact that one, it was in San Francisco [California], and two--you know, we had the '60s [1960s] and there's, you know and Berke-, you're in the Berkeley [California] area, right?
Speaker 2: San Francisco.
Speaker 1: San Francisco.  But it's--there, you know, was a lot of experimenta-, you know, mores were getting looser.  Was that impacting your practice at all?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  Later on--it wasn't that much later on--Haight Ashbury [neighborhood]--I saw some of the kids in Haight Ashbury.  And again so much of my work has been to--learning to broaden.  Many of the kids that I saw from the Haight Ashbury were upper middle-class white kids.  A fair number of kids were from service families.  Fathers had been [U.S.] Army, [U.S.] Navy, [U.S.] Marine officers--rigid families--rigid fathers.  They were rebelling against that.  Yeah, that--I'm 73, so that, you know, things are when you reflect and think about things, why they happened are much more clearer than when they were happening.  So that yes, experimentation loosening--wanting to perhaps be broader.  All of that would have played into it.  My own skills, who I am.  You know, so that--all of that then would come together.  Yes. '60s [1960s], very, very much a variable. But were I in Milwaukee [Wisconsin] or L.A. [Los Angeles, California] or New York [New York] or Chicago [Illinois], then there would have been some other set of factors for me or for those people.  I think I remember a guy--pardon me--of my generation, Kermit Millenger, I think was his name, who was a psychiatrist in Chicago.  And I think he was in private practice. [Dr.] Al [Alvin Poussaint] would be another one--Poussaint.  But kind of wherever we were, or are for that matter, a series of things.  You know, there's a confluence of forces that then you impact and that impact upon you that then create whatever it is that you're trying to do.  It's a--it would be--at some point it would be very understandable to you because that's exactly what you're doing.  You know, that a series of forces now are, you know, are impacting you.  There's a confluence that somebody way removed probably doesn't even understand.  "What's that?  A history project?  What are you doing?"  You know.  Where as for you, at a given point, it's fairly clear.
Story_ID: 5353
Speaker 1: How does your [psychiatry] practice change?  You know between--in this--you know, you say that you were starting to get more black patients. Did you say, as time went on? No. No.
Speaker 2: Uh-uh.
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: It would go back and forth. And after about 19--I was in practice for about ten years.  After about 1972, 1973, I then began to do management consulting and I initially tried to do both. But I was traveling and I couldn't.  After the books came out, I would get invited to come to a company, private sector. Consult.  I didn't have a clue what that meant.  I knew what it was to come and consult at a mental health clinic, to go on rounds in a  psychiatric ward.  To go to a family service agency and meet with some social workers and psychologists.  I had done that. I didn't know what it meant to consult inside Procter and Gamble [Company] or inside DuPont [Corporation]. Those were the places that I would get called.  And so it was on-the-job training.  It was putting together something. It was beginning to see a constituency of people, namely African Americans working in large organizations.  Struggling, trying to make sense out of what was going on.  And, you know, I liken it to rather than people coming to my office to sit in my chair or to metaphorically lie on my couch.  I was going to their environments and sitting in their chairs and metaphorically my couch was there.  So that where people would say, "Oh well you  quit doing psychiatry."  I quit doing it in the formal sense and diminished talking about,  "I'm a psychiatrist."  Because if, as a consultant, to say, "I'm a psychiatrist."  "Oh I didn't know we were sick here."  You know.  So that, you know, it was that part of my attraction would be, "This is a guy who understands people.  But we're glad to have you.  But don't--please don't--just say you're an M.D.  Or don't even say it," you know.  And so there's a whole different kind of ballgame.  And it was interesting.  It changed the numbers for me.  It was, you know. You're limited fifty-minute hour by how much you can charge.  It isn't that you're unlimited in a corporation.  But the numbers were much different.  Exciting.  An underserved--a paradoxically underserved population. First generation of African Americans in corporate America.  So that I then began--that was my practice.  That's what I did.  That's what I refined.  That's what I do.  That's what I do to this day.
Story_ID: 5354
Speaker 1: I want to go back to you writing 'Black Rage' and how that even came about.  You said it came out of your private practice?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  You know, it's coauthored with [Dr. William] Bill Grier.  It came out of our private practices.  The world as we knew it was exploding.  The Watts [Los Angeles, California neighborhood] riot had occurred in 1965.  The Selma [Alabama] to Montgomery [Alabama] march.  The Civil Rights Movement was turning, you know, 'Black Power' had come in as its slogan.  It was turning away from nonviolence.  The consciousness of black people was just being elevated exponentially so that people were getting in touch with being angry.  They were angry, you know, "Not gonna take this any more."  You know, "Dammit, I've been quiet--."  You know, someone would come in, "You know, I've been quiet on the job."  You know, I remember one guy saying, you know--he said, "My nick-name is Brownowski."  I said, "Why that?"  He said, "You know, there are a lot of Poles [Polish people] there.  And so they're Stepenowski this or that.  So they just make me Brownowski."  He said, "And I hate it, you know.  I don't like it."  And he said, "Yeah, you're supposed to take a joke.  It's supposed to be good-natured.  They're mocking me and I know it, you know."  Or people would just say, "You know, I'm tired of hearing nigger.  I'm tired of hearing it at work.  I'm tired--I'm tired of knowing that I'm not gonna get promoted."  So that people were--black people at least the sample that we were seeing--and don't forget it's a selected sample because these are the people who are coming to see you.  They were angry, you know.  They were, you know, "Help me understand it.  Help me understand myself.  Help me understand the--you know, the external milieu."
Speaker 1: And what was--what was your--how did--but how did the book even come--I mean how did it come about?  How did you and Bill Grier--,
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: How did you decide you were gonna go--?
Speaker 2: Bill was in Detroit [Michigan]--had gotten divorced and moved to San Francisco [California] to take over a child psychiatric clinic.  Since our world, our universe, was so small, we clearly met very early--connected and we started talking about it, you know.  I had been writing an article.  I think he had been writing an article--"Let's get together and write a book."  And, you know, it kind of went from there.  And it was, it was time, it was timely.  It was, you know--that was, that was what was happening.  That was what was going on.  Plus a lot of people were, you know--part of what you say of--quotes--"Our resistance to mental health treatment," but, you know people were seeing folks.  We were reading articles in the literature about people treating black patients that were as rife with stereotypes and racism as anything else.  You know, so that we wanted to have some kind of manual to help people understand.  To make understandable some of the clinical issues that African Americans were having as we saw it.
Speaker 1: And it's not that 'Black Rage' was anything new.  But do you think it was--I mean it had been articulated in other things like, you know, you mentioned 'Native Son.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You know.
Speaker 2: Hadn't been articulated in a clinical sense.
Speaker 1: But that's--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: what I want.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So that's what the importance of this was.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Right.  So it was articulated in a clinical sense.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Exactly.
Speaker 1: And what were your--what were some of the underlying theses?
Speaker 2: That all blacks are angry, and that they are angry with legitimate reason to be angry.  But by saying that, then that means that we've gotta help people understand it and effectively manage it, you know, because they'll think it sometimes got misconstrued. "Oh!  Well then you're saying it's okay for them to--."  "No.  I'm not saying it's okay to do anything.  We're just saying before you can treat a problem, you have to understand it."  You know, and there were so many clinicians that would see black patients with absolutely no understanding of the context of their lives--you know, where they were coming from, what was infringing on them, what went on in their heads.  You know, so they would just impose a model on them that many times was inappropriate for the people with whom they were working with, then or now.  You know.  I think there is now much more a thrust to help people be much more culturally competent in a broader sense.  But even so, it's still--we're a long, long way from that.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you find that in the book--that book really catapulted you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Very much so. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: No question.
Speaker 1: And did it--do you think it catapulted you as well or legitimized you in a different--or opened up, a viewpoint to the white community as well as the black community.
Speaker 2: No question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Absolutely.  No question.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was, you know, I say it was time and it was timely.  Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated in April of 1968.  Our book came out in June of 1968--and, you know, with all the--you're too young.  With all the attendant urban unrest, riots around the country.  In some cities it still hasn't been in--hasn't been rebuilt--so it came out with all that.  Eldridge Cleaver's book ['Soul on Ice'] had come out the year before didn't do very well and it was one of those books that came back a year later.  They reissued it and it did well.  So it was, you know, right in the middle of people--at least a certain part of the cultural elite wanting to understand what was going on.  And it fit right into that.
Story_ID: 5355
Speaker 1: You were asked to speak and to consult with people [after his book 'Black Rage' was published]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  You know, you kind of hit the stage.  And as I say, "Dr. Cobbs we'd like for you to come back.  You seem to have some understanding of things."  And it would be those eggshell conversations--"Well, you know, we have some employees that we--well can you come back?"  And what the message would be, "We have some black employees and we really don't understand what's going on.  We don't want any problems at this place.  Can you help us."  But you would have to tease and  you know and I--just try to get--try to get some handle on a formulation of what the issues were.  And it really would be trying to understand how people make it in an organization in a corporate culture as a--from then most of my work was in corporations.  I did some private, public sector things and still occasionally do.  But for the most part it was in the private sector.  So it was understanding corporations. Understanding corporate culture.  Very importantly, understanding power.  Understanding how power is allocated in an organization--who has it, who doesn't.  And from that, gradually learning how--helping people, "How you can get it," you know.  If you grin you're in--this is your game.  That it's not the white man's game, you work here.  So that either you get in there and grapple or you--maybe you need to just, you know, kind of go someplace else.  But if you're gonna be here and wanna be competitive, then here are some things that you and I need to talk about.  So it was really a transposition of what went on to the office into a more focused coaching, counseling, mentoring kind of thing.
Speaker 1: And it really created a view of a discipline that was--what was it?  Black therapy?  I forgot the term.
Speaker 2: Ethnotherapy.
Speaker 1: Ethnotherapy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, right.
Speaker 1: Sorry.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: That's alright.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And this was--did anyone challenge you on, you know, a thing like ethnotherapy?
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: As a--okay.
Speaker 2: Challenged all the time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Then or now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Validated in that I had a young, younger protégé Judith Weinstein Klein.  I met Judith when she was at UC [University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California], had finished college and was working there at EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] office.  Judith went back and got a Ph.D.  She wrote her dissertation on ethnotherapy, and she applied it to Jews.  And what it was--and that's why in the memoir I--that's, you know, kind of my task is now to spell it out.  So that, you know, it is more--it is really helping people understand the backdrop in which they grow up.  And particularly for people who grow up against a backdrop of pigeonholes, categories, stereotypes, prejudices, that if you are unaware of them or act as if you're unaware of them, you fall prey to them.  You buy into them even more than the people who lay them on you.  So that ethnotherapy is helping people understand that kind of context and that kind of backdrop.  And it doesn't mean that they don't understand other parts of their functioning.  But may or may not be like everyone else.  But it is not one size fits all.  It really is, "How do you understand?  How do you make understandable that feeling of loneliness you have sitting in Chicago [Illinois] at a legal office wondering, Gee is it me?"  You know.  "Why do I feel this way?"  No, no--yeah, part of it ultimately is you and your responsibility.  But you are feeling what people are feeling in L.A. [Los Angeles, California].  What 'Joe Blow' is feeling in Atlanta [Georgia]--what we are feeling as we evolve from way outside into the mainstream.
Story_ID: 5356
Speaker 1: 'The Jesus Bag.'  When did that--how did that come about?  That was a different--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  'Jesus Bag' came out '68 [1968], '71 [1971], yeah--'71 or '72 [1972]. I think it was '71.
Speaker 1: Now tell the story about it's--.
Speaker 2: 'Jesus Bag' was looking at the psychological influences of religion on blacks.  And it got mislabeled because a lot of people, you know, religion, so they thought it was either an attack on religion--more an attack than a defense.  But it was really just trying to look what were some of the psychological inhibiters and the psychological enablers that we have because we are, in fact, a deeply religious and a deeply spiritual people.
Speaker 1: And with that, why did you go from 'Black Rage' to 'Jesus Bag'?  They sort of, you know, because the one is focused more, you know, with--well, yeah.  It was focused more on the workplace and the other was more--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.  But--.
Speaker 1: --general living. You know.
Speaker 2: Yeah, pretty much.  But just--It was kind of, you know, when you collaborated.  Evolution of a collaboration.  Right.
Speaker 1: And what were your--what were some of your theories in that book also what you looked at?  Because religion is a center, has been a central part--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  We looked at, in some ways, how does, if we don't understand it, how does our religion serve sometimes as inhibiters to our progress?  And at other places, how does religion serve as enables, as facilitators of our progress?  Would be some of the themes of it.
Story_ID: 5357
Speaker 1: 1972, that's when P&G [Procter & Gamble Company] approached you--,
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --to start doing their consulting.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And they--why don't we put this in context because what is happening in the country?  Blacks are starting to enter in, you know--.
Speaker 2: Right.  The first generation of--first generation of corporate people beyond, you know, the custodians.  A few people now on assembly lines.  But that first generation of blacks at entry-level management is beginning to come in.  Equal opportunity laws had been passed in the sixties with [U.S. President] Lyndon [B.] Johnson.  Affirmative action now becomes a living, breathing concept. So organizations for a lot of reasons don't wanna be sued, wanna be socially responsible. Some organizations looked at those but also began to see markets that had been ignored.  So all that then came together to then, "Well you know, here's this guy.  Well why don't we call him."  You know.  So Bill [Grier M.D.] was more a very brilliant clinician.  More psychoanalytically trained. I was more social activist and we came together as two psychiatrists so that that kind of work was not necessarily Bill's bent or bag, much more mine.  And so, you know, as I say it started going--began to develop my own framework of understanding an organization, diagnosing what I saw as some of the issues, beginning to impact a constituency, starting first with--always knowing I got here because African Americans need somebody to advocate and to make an impact, so, clearly that was my first constituency.  Then, I had other constituencies, I--more and more, as time went on, would work with women.  Began to develop relationships with upper-level white guys, so that as I then continued to evolve into an executive coach, I many times would end up coaching someone non-black just as easily as I was coaching someone white.
Speaker 1: But coaching--now I understand coaching as something of the last ten years.  Is that--am I, am I totally wrong in timing?
Speaker 2: Major executives--let me change that--aware executives have always had people that they would call in to help them with something.  It could be, "I'm making a presentation."  It could be, "I'm going downtown to meet with so-and-so," so that they had the resources.  I can't tell you the first time a guy from Procter & Gamble [Company] flew out here, an executive.  "You know, flying out here, just want to talk to you, Price."  Well, he had the resources.  That it's a whole new world, you know.  So that yeah, we may now talk about coaching, mentoring, whatever but, you know.  I, can think of a guy that I would talk with who just wanted to chitchat.  "Price I don't have anybody that I can have authentic conversations with.  Let me tell you what's going on."  I can think of another guy.  He asked me to meet with his wife.  He was now working--he had, he really had gotten passionate about affirmative action.  He wanted to see his company as the preeminent company in terms of--we didn't even use the word diversity then.  That, now we would say--that would be diversity with people at all levels.  And his wife didn't know what the heck was going on.  And he asked me, "Price, would you spend the day with my wife--just letting her, just--so that, you know, something becomes rational that she thinks is irrational, you know."  So I met with her.  And so that--it became, you know, in a sense developing a whole different practice. You know, just using skills that you knew, and having some models but, you know, it's kind of putting it together on the fly.  You know, and then, you know, kind of molding it, "Oh, oh, that's what I'm doing!"
Speaker 1: Well, that was sort of a wonderful find, when you think about it.  I want to go back to what your--actually your first assignment from P&G was, and who called you in.  P&G called you in?
Speaker 2: Yeah, P&G called me in.  It would usually be--I'm not one of those people who would say, "When black people get in organizations they don't call on you."  I would not have had a business if it had not been black folks who--now, they may not have been the check-signers, but they were the ones who would talk with somebody, and as time went on, they gradually became the check-signers.  But, you know, it would be entry-level, like I think at Procter & Gamble, entry-level engineers.  "We just, you know, we just want somebody to help us make sense out of this," and help them make sense out of it, you know, and so you would do it.  I can think of a couple of people I met, one now who is Lloyd Ward, who is now the CEO [Chief Executive Officer] of the United States Olympic Committee [USOC].  I met Lloyd when he was an entry-level engineer, and had been in and out of his career for the whole time through Procter & Gamble, Ford [Company], back to Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo [Inc.], Frito-Lay [Inc.], went to Maytag [Corporation], and now he's USOC Chairman.  There are folks like that--Ann Fudge.  I met Ann on a program twenty years ago in Cleveland [Ohio].  Ann was a--I've forgotten what you call it in marketing, a product manager--I, I probably don't have the right title.  I've been--you know, so we--kind of been in and out of her professional life since then, so that there--any number of people like that.  I develop relationships and relationships that persist, and so that, you know, it might be--I heard from a guy yesterday--haven't seen him probably in six or seven years.  "Price, how are you doing, you got a minute?  Let me run this dilemma by you."  Fine.  So we talked, "Gee thanks, you know, you've helped me."  I might not hear from him for two years, I might hear from him next week.

Speaker 1: What patterns did you see sort of emerging, you know, or have you seen emerging over your years of practice in corporate America, and what were some of the constant themes?
Speaker 2: One, effective management of rage.  That you--if you're going to be successful and black, you have to account for race and you have to effectively manage your rage.  Once saying that, then there are as many different ways of doing it as there are people, you know.  That--there may be a few people, maybe, who go through and deny race and gender, maybe.  Maybe a few--you know, as the social scientists are always saying, "There's gotta be a few."  But for the most part, the people whom I know have had to account for race and increasingly, gender.  "What do I do with it and about it?  If I exaggerate it, I'm not gonna make it.  If I deny or minimize it, something's going to come along to bite me and remind me that it's there.  So in the healthiest of ways, how do I account for it?"  You know, and sometimes accounting for it is putting it to a side.  I would counsel people sometimes that--yeah, in the '60s [1960s] and early '70s [1970s], maybe up through the mid-'70s, you could 'mau-mau' a little bit.  And my wife now tells me, "Define what mau-mau is, because it's an old term, you know."  You could jaw, you could be the militant, you could, you know--now people kind of trivialize it and call it, "Playing the race card."  Well, you might have been able to, okay.  In today's world, where we as blacks are presumed to have all the laws on our side--you know, gee, you've got all these goals and quotas, and whatever. Then you have only once or twice in a year or two period to raise race or gender and effectively do anything about it.  Does that mean things aren't going to happen?  Of course not.  How do you, how do you manage that?  What strategies do you have?  How do you--you know, because your first job, your first task is to have an exemplary performance--okay, years ago you would think that's all you need.  "Boy, if I can just do it well, if I can just get through law school and get on the Law Journal, and if I'm a good lawyer," then you get into a law firm and you realize, "Yeah, I think I'm a pretty good lawyer, I won that case, but there are a whole lot of people things, and inter-relationships and alliances and cliques, and--oh, there's power."  And I think learning and understanding all that would be some of the constant themes that I have seen.
Speaker 1: Now, have you found though in your work that if someone had--you know, was successful at managing their rage, were there other factors that impacted their ability to move forward still given that factor?
Speaker 2: Clearly, no question.  That--racism, sexism are not dead, and we con ourselves if we think they are.  What my learning--you know, you asked about my learning--one of my learnings have been, it is not that people walk around, "Oh, I'm gonna discriminate against them, I don't like black folks."  If--most cases it's the opposite, "Gee, I wanna be fair.  I don't wanna be walking around here, you know, disliking people based on their skin color," or whatever.  But they have grown up in this society, they have incorporated with the very air that they breathe certain things of superiority-inferiority, certain stereotypes, they have mod-, in their minds they have models of success.  "Oh, you are successful if you look a certain way."  Now, that's so preconscious they don't really even spell it out.  You know, I can think of talking with a guy once--and it was a black woman--he wanted to promote her and he was struggling, and he was honest enough to share the struggle with me.  He said, "You know, I, guess if I'm being honest with--you know, I trust you enough to know that this is confidential.  I guess I just worry about she's gotta represent us downtown, and I--."  I say, you know, and I say, "I respect you for saying it, and I guess I get pissed off that you've gotta say it, but I respect that at least we're dealing with a real issue."  "Okay."  This was a guy who was ahead of the game just to articulate it, you know.  Well, of course those things come up.  Sometimes--I'll give a perfect example--working in a manufacturing situation in the South--in the '70s [1970s].  A start-up situation, so, young engineers could go there--it would catapult their career, if you were successful.  Okay, white engineers would go, "It was great."  They lived around a country club, it was a great situation.  They would stay there one, two, three or four years, go back to corporate headquarters, go someplace else--always (with emphasis) get a promotion or two.  Black engineers come.  First of all, their spouses, if they were married--"What the hell we doin' going South?  You know, I mean, I thought the whole name of the game was for us to get to Wisconsin!  Why we goin' South?"  Then they'd get there--housing's still rigidly segregated, the company impacts--creates kind of a no-man's--you know, demilitarized zone, in effect that, "We're gonna control this housing complex and you can live there."  And that would--you know so that--always a lot of factors.  And the--you know, which is why I have such admiration for people who were able to get through that, to--you know, and I just use that.  Because I'd say--I can think of a guy from Chicago [Illinois] who now is retired--he's part of 'Cracking the Corporate Code', and we talk about him, and since it's in the book and he talked about it--he worked at Sears [Roebuck and Company].  And he would talk about--you know, when he started the kind of job that he wanted, which was the job that other people had--"Well, I'm not certain that we can have a black person in that job."  And he said he argued for six months to get the job--knew pushing the envelope--"If I argue too much, I know I'm not gonna get the job.  If I don't push for it, I know I'm not gonna get the job."  You know, so that--just to be able to get through that, and to stay intact and to raise a family and to move up--and he retired as a vice president.  So, no there--in, in looking at things through a clinical lens clearly (with emphasis) it does not mean that, "Oh, the world has suddenly changed and we're now colorblind and gender-blind," that's just not true.  Nor should we be colorblind and gender-blind.  It is that we need to take the value--the negative value judgments out of it--we need to take the stereotypes out of it, we need to take the pigeonholes out of it.  But we're--you know, I think it's ridiculous to think that we're going to attain some state of colorblindness or gender-blindness.

Speaker 1: In those cases where people [corporate employees] were successful, what have you found to be traits that have existed?  Have there been consistent traits?
Speaker 2: Yeah, certainly.  The standard ones, above-average intelligence, not necessarily the smartest of the smart, but, you know.  A lot of tenacity.  The ability to align their intellect and their emotions, that--to stay on top of their emotions.  To, to not let--"Oh, I'm pissed off, let me--."  "No, no.  Yeah, I'm pissed off but let me control that."  The ability to understand and deal with ambiguity--to connect the dots--you know, never been--and you know, you were asking about role models.  "Never been in this situation before.  Kinda' scary.  But let me just take a step back, take a deep breath.  Yeah.  Let me start connecting the dots, you know, so that--."  Those would be some, just--and always the ability to manage their rage.  To effectively manage their rage.  Not--, pardon me--not ignore it, not deny it, not act like it's not there, to acknowledge it.  And it's what I say, "Use your anger to fuel your intellect.  Let your anger be the fuel for your intellect."  Because if you don't convert it in that way, it just eats you up, you know, you just walk around, you know, with your jaws tight, getting ulcers, tense, what have you.
Speaker 1: And what about the isolation that people would often (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) (Unclear) Then or now, help people.  You gotta get some alliances.  You gotta, you gotta find people, sometimes in or out of your organization that have some understanding of the kinds of things you do--not the kind of things that you do technically, because a lot of times that's pretty difficult--but understand something about the kind of environment you're in.  The kind of vectors and forces that impinge on you in that--and that's not easy.  And that's particularly difficult sometimes for African Americans, because they say--you know, I know people whose families don't really quite understand what is going on.  And it, and it isn't that they're intellectually incapable of it, it's that they don't have the experiences to quite understand.  So that--so many times just helping people know you are not renouncing your roots by not having some intimate conversation with your brother about it.  You make two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year and your brother makes fifty-two thousand dollars a year or thirty-two thousand dollars a year.  It--you are really conning yourself if you think your brother doesn't think one, you're grand theft rich, and that two, that the kind of things you're talking about, "All the money you're making, darn, why you having this problem?"  So you've gotta find, you've gotta find people that at least you can have some conversation with--if it's a significant other, you're ahead of the game.  If it's a girlfriend, boyfriend, if it's family member, you're ahead of the game.  But you've got to make a conscious search to at least break up the isolation, and I see it in two ways--one, there's an individual isolation that all of us can go through--there's an aloneness.  Then there's a cultural isolation that you can't drop out who you are and how you got there, because that, to me can be more debilitating at times than just being--all of us at times can be individually isolated.  If you're culturally isolated, you lose your frame of reference, you know, I mean, using the parlance, "You forget you you are."  You know, and Malcolm X  [civil rights activist] had famous sayings about forgetting who you were.
Story_ID: 5360
Speaker 1: [Asking] me about being psychiatric consultant to a project so let me give you my last experience with this kind of--the kind of psychiatric consulting you're talking about. Our mayor [of San Francisco, California] now is  Willie Brown.  And Willie is certainly very well known.  Well when Willie was the Speaker of the [California General] Assembly, I guess in conversation with his friend Barry Diller [entertainment executive], 'In Living Color' [comedy television program] was starting--Keenan Ivory Wayans [director/actor]--that was his idea and they were getting off the ground.  And well they knew it was gonna be edgy, but they just didn't want, you know, kind of black folks on them, particularly NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], so they came up with this idea of getting a psychiatric consultant.  I was it.  They also checked with John Jacobs who was head of [National] Urban League [civil rights organization] at that time.  So I was quotes, "The ideal person."  It was kind of fun, and it was interesting.  Because Keenan Ivory Wayans was very nice to me--"Doc, I like you. I respect you."  He didn't pay the slightest bit of attention to me (laughs).  And they went for thirteen weeks and he got an Emmy [Academy of Television Arts and Sciences award].  As of the day he got that Emmy, I was gone (laughs), you know.  You know how it is.  You're in certain situations where people wanna get rid of you and you know they just don't like you--that wasn't that at all.  I mean they were very pleasant to me, you know.  I'm  certain I reminded some of them of their dads or whatever.  So there--nobody was ever hostile.  But it was like, "What is this guy?  What does he know about comedy?" (laughs). You know, so I give you that  as background.  As we talk about some other psychiatric consultant stint for an organization, keep that in mind. (Laughs)
Story_ID: 5361
Speaker 1: Do you feel positive about the future of blacks in corporate America?
Speaker 2: Um-hmm.
Speaker 1: You do.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Let me say why.  I feel positive, because I feel positive about blacks.  That whatever hurdles that have been placed in front of us, in some way, sooner or later we surmount them.  We have a genius for survival and a knack of mastery.  You know.  So that, yeah, will there be further trials and tribulations?  Yes.  Are all the problems gone?  Of course not.  But we are better educated as we come in.  Now the  downside of that and what gives me pause is that  if I were to compare the first generation of blacks in corporate America, early '70s [1970s] with now, then people were conscious of race.  Sometimes too conscious and it got in their way.  In today's world, I run into people where they think it's an irrelevancy.  These are black folks.  And I don't want to be in the position, "Oh, it's important."  You know.  It's kind of like saying the sky is falling.  All I say is, "Here's my card."  And I know if I live long enough, they will call me because they will run into me.  So that I think sometimes people give themselves kind of a needless obstacle course because they are better educated.  "I've got my MBA [Master of Business Administration].  I went to this school.  I went to that school.  I went to prep school."  And that when they get into organizations they get faked out of position.  You know, I sometimes, when I look at some of the comics on BET [Black Entertainment Television], and I see a very multiracial audience.  And I see people in those audiences and I say, you know, many of those white kids now view themselves as nonracist because they can sit there and they're hearing the same jokes and the 'N' word and whatever.  So that in their lives away from that they think they're non-racist.  So that, "What's the big deal?  You know, gee.  I went to see so-and-so.  I used the 'N' word.  You know, I listen to rap music.  I wear my pants baggy."  But some of the basic dynamics of racism, namely postulations of superiority, postulations of inferiority that remain pretty preconscious or still there.  Until we have those kind of discussions and get through it then it's always gonna be a challenge.  I think many of the beginning  discussions around reparations are, in fact, mask discussions of the influence of slavery, of racism, of how it impacts us.  And I think, to the extent that that goes on, then those are gonna be healthy.  I think the unhealthy part is gonna be, you know, when we get down to the nitty, what does it mean?  You mean we're supposed to get what?  Does every black get some money or--?  Or what about people who are interracially married?  What about people who are descendents of [U.S. President] Thomas Jefferson?  You know.  They now have white--what about Halle Berry [actress]?  You know?  They're--Halle Berry describes herself as an African American woman, gets an Oscar [Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences award] as an African American woman.  Her mother who is white is sitting there very proud of her and they're obviously proud of each other, you know. So that I'd say part of it might be a slippery slope.  But the healthy part is I think to tee it up to get the topic on the table.  Which we've really never had.  We've come close, but we've never really had those discussions.
Speaker 1: The discussions of--?
Speaker 2: Of what's the meaning of race in America?  What is racism?  How does it play itself out in subtle ways?  When you talk about a paradigm of white superiority, black inferiority, how does that play itself out?  How does it manifest itself in our culture?  How do we get discussions around that?  The closest discussions that we've had, even tentative ones are in sports.  You know, where white players are described as so smart and heady.  Black players are described as athletic.  Michael Jordan [basketball player] is considered, you know, just kind of a great athlete, rather than somebody who's very disciplined, who has worked and trained, you know, developed new shots and whatever.  But just even tentative discussions come up like that.  In our wider culture, who's a good chemist?  Who isn't?  How come we don't go into science?  How do we get into science?  All of that I think if we can tee those up, I think that can be a very healthy discussion.
Speaker 1: Do you think that that discussion will happen?  And do you think that there will be things that force that discussion?
Speaker 2: I do.  What there will be I don't know.  But yes, I do.  You know it's, kind of like sometimes the imagery I think of is a bear that hibernates and rather than just hibernates once a year, maybe it hibernates two or three times.  It just kind of disappears.  And so we forget. Gee, you know, we don't have to worry about the bear.  The bear is gone.  And then, lo and behold we look up and there's the bear right back again, you know, kind of snatching stuff out of our--out of the trunk of our car or whatever.  And so that yes, things will happen.  Something will happen.  Whether it be police brutality, whether it be a class action suit, whether it be something.  But until we really get at and have a common multicultural understanding of what the issues are, yeah, I don't have any doubt.  And I don't say that as some doomsayer.  I think, you know, we've made progress.  The world for African Americans is much better now than it was when I was a kid.  And I would--you know, I'm not one of those people who says, "Oh it's worse.  I'm imprisoned by it," or whatever.  I  think the people that I see saying it are invariably people who are a hell of a lot better off economically than their parents were. I see people who make a moral equivalent to not getting a cab in New York to some feeling of getting lynched.  Well that's BS.  You know.  I can't stand not getting a cab in New York [New York].  But I also know that I'm going to walk to the Hilton Hotel and have a nice room.  And that is not at all equivalent to what I knew people went through of jumping off sidewalks and, you know, being lynched often for looking at somebody or whistling at somebody.  So that the world clearly for African Americans is better.  But the journey's long,  you know. The journey is very, very long.
Story_ID: 5362
Speaker 1: Dr. Cobbs, the question I have for you is what about integration?  Do you feel that, you know, that it is a group thing?  Do you think that ultimately that--because there's a part of the black community that's still very much suffering.
Speaker 2: Very much so.
Speaker 1: And so I'm wondering what your--even your thoughts, your hopes or concerns about this community is?
Speaker 2: See I'd drop out whether I think integration is quotes "A good thing" that one of the--an essence of America is a certain kind of Americanization of all of us.  And I think for us to act like it does not occur to us begs the question.  You know, so that, you know.  They sang 'We Shall Overcome' in Tiananmen Square [Beijing, China].  They were singing 'We Shall Overcome' in Bosnia [and Herzegovina]. When the prime minister of I think it was Norway was assassinated [sic, Sweden's Prime Minister Olaf Palme in 1986], when they came together in grief, they sang 'We Shall Overcome.'  They are singing that what?  Because we are black?  Or because we're black Americans?  When I say that, at some point, you know, to me it is how we participate in the fabric of America and whether the playing field in the fabric of America is level.  And then from that people make their own choices.  You know?  That--I think any of us particularly middle-class folks, and, you know, increasingly anybody black who feels so strongly nationalistic about, "We just gotta be with ourselves"  begs the whole question of, you know, as we look at our families, as we see America, as we look at TV [television] people are more and more coming together.  In San Francisco [California] as I listen to Asians, there's a whole thing of the majority of Chinese women in certain educational economic brackets marry Caucasian men.  You know, so that I would assume they're having that dialogue.  My protégé who became my peer, Judith Weinstein Klein [M.D.] will talk about that one of the things she found in common with black women was that Jewish women had the same issue--had many of the comparable issues.  "We lose our men to non-Jewish women."  Black women, "We lose our men to white women."  Okay.  All of that is just part of a churning of America and I think when the playing field is level, when we occupy slots in all the fabric of America, that's becomes much less of an explosive personal issue.  It just because it's part of the way America functions. And then most people who don't wanna make certain kind of choices don't make it.  A fascinating thing.  My wife and I were talking about it not too long ago.  It was over the Christmas holidays.  And I was looking at BET [Black Entertainment Television] and they were discussing Kwanzaa.  And they had one of these erudite panels of, you know, one guy in order to let us know how smart he was, he kind of fixed his mouth as he talked, you know.  So you said, "Gee, he must be smart the way he fixes his mouth."  So he was talking about Kwanzaa.  And someone was saying, "Well, do white people celebrate Kwanzaa?"  "Well I can't understand why someone white would want to celebrate Kwanzaa,"--he misses the point of America (laughs), you know.  That's like saying, "I enjoy a Chinese New Year's parade."  I'm not Chinese (laughs).  You know, that's part of America.  You know, so that for him to even say that, to me, it would say, "Well you missed something."  You know, that we're are not some small isolated group that can be nationalistic, as if we have some kind of unique culture, that is going to persist.  We are Americans.  We are Americans who happen to be black.  We are Americans of African descent.  We therefore are African Americans, but we're Americans.  You know, and I think our solutions have to be within the context of America. Our solutions are not gonna be absent, something around America.  For better or for worse.
Story_ID: 5363
Speaker 1: Now what about those people who say that black community all need to sit on a therapist's couch.  That the whole community needs that.
Speaker 2: If they're defining therapy in some broad sense, yeah.  But there I would put therapy--I would put economics in it.  That we need to become more economically savvy.  We need to understand what the free enterprise system and the capitalistic system is all about.  We need to understand something about investments.  That, even in my little town of San Francisco [California], I see small business run by high school graduates.  We used to go to a cleaners run by high school graduates.  They were doing very well--went to Hong Kong [China] twice a year--young!  You know, still in their twenties--doing very well.  You know so that, of course we need an education.  But there's a whole America of small businesses of entrepreneurs that is part of it.  I think, you know, if the people--if when you say, "We need to sit--."  If that's part of sitting on the couch, if that's part of the therapy, then yeah.  We need to understand ourselves.  We need to understand what's going on. We need to understand power.  All of that.  Yes. Then I would agree.
Story_ID: 5364
Speaker 1: Now I go back to, you know, (laughs) I've just been fascinated (unclear) with the megachurch, but that's okay.  But okay.  You know.  I go back to--.
Speaker 2: (Off-camera voice): Ask about corporatization, Julieanna, 'cause the megachurch is part of the larger trend towards corporatization--.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) That's all it is.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have any thoughts about that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.  I think, one,  I'm not a part of one.  So this is an observation rather than a participant.  I would think that the megachurch does reflect a certain kind of corporatization.  I agree with that.  We've gotta run this like a business.  We've gotta have departments.  But, you know, beyond that, I wanna see the economic impact on communities.  I hear that there is one.  I'm just not so certain that I believe that there is one.  I think some people get enriched.  I have no doubt about that.  You know, so that to me it still says we search for something in the spiritual realm, all of which is very, very valid, but sometimes if we load too much secular into the spiritual realm we don't get it.  That you can't be a profit making enterprise and be a church.  I realize the Mormons seem to have done a pretty good job of it.  There may be others who have.  But--and people well may learn things.  But at some point I think the job of quotes a "megachurch" would be to help people become entrepreneurs and maybe how do you find seed money and let's have some investment bankers come in and tell us what they do and how you get ten thousand dollars to do this or that.

Speaker 1: If the community needs therapy, we have to help the community understand that building wealth is part of being American and how you do that.  I have a good friend who works in Pepsi [sic, PepsiCo, Inc].  And he told me a story that I'd put in a book as still is germane.  He was talking with a group of young black kids.  He's a vice president of Pepsi.  His wife is a lawyer and was then at IBM [Corporation]--she--and they're young--she subsequently retired to do some family businesses.  So he's talking to this group of young black kids from Harlem [New York, New York].  And he's talking to a guy.  Shaq [basketball player Shaquille O'Neill] had just signed a contract or whatever.  So he was taking about, "I wanna, you know, I play basketball.  I wanna be Shaq."  And my friend Maurice was saying,  "You know", I kept squirming--I didn't know--I don't wanna tell him.  Well my wife and I make X amount a year.  I didn't wanna come through that way.  But I just wanted to let him know.  Look there's so many steps.  Being a Shaq is like saying, 'I wanna hit the lottery.'"  And, you know, as we were talking, you know, I said, "You know, what the kid is really saying, 'I either wanna be Shaq or I ain't shit.'"  You know and we've gotta help our kids, you know, get away from that concept.  That there're all kinds of ways that people build wealth, raise their kids, go on trips and enjoy life.  And they don't have megabucks.  You know.  They just have a comfortable income that they manage well.  They spend their money wisely.  They save their money.  And I think all of that to me is part of the challenges as we move forward.
Story_ID: 5366
Speaker 1: There's been some controversy of late about the psychiatric profession and the use of medication increasing.  And I just was wondering what your thoughts about that were.
Speaker 2: I do have thoughts and I'll give them.  But let me preface it. I have not practiced psychiatry and written prescriptions in twenty-five plus years.  So, once saying that, I think it's over-used.  Part of it is the culture has speeded up. You know.  "I don't wanna sit and see you twice a week for a year.  Just give me a pill," you know.  So that, yeah.  I think  people are looking for magic bullets.  You know, it's like dieting--you see these advertisements for dieting. "You take this pill, you can continue eating just what you want.  You don't have to exercise, and you'll lose ten pounds a week," you know.  Well it's not possible unless, you know, you're gonna get sick.  Or unless it's something, you know, maladaptive.  Well I think, yes, there can be an over-use of medication.  The positive part, there are--psychopharmacology has come a long way so that there are things that can more readily be brought under control by medication.  The major, negative part of it  is that all too often people don't get into the aetiology, the causation, that is well within their grasp.  You know.  The more I can understand about myself, how I grew up, what I did, how I was influenced. Then the more I can get in conscious control of some of these things that are out of control.  Well a lot of people don't wanna go through that.  My training was that.  You know.  So I, of course, I have a bias in that way.
Speaker 1: Do you--with the--I mean--some people believe that the whole field of psychiatry is still beyond, you know, behind.  I mean--its acceptance is still behind--,
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: --traditional medicine.
Speaker 2: Yeah and also the HMOs [health maintenance organizations] promote that. Because a lot of times, you know, they don't--you can see somebody for two visits.  You know and so many things are economically driven, so that if I can't see a patient for twenty weeks and that person can--insurance will  pay for it.  Then, of course, if pills are it, then I'll give the person the best-- that's the best I can do.

Speaker 1: You know, I go back to the fact that you started your consulting in 1972.  And you know, if you had--.
Speaker 2: Formerly in private sector I had done consulting.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And had done it in different ways.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: But I'm saying that, you know, we're talking as of this year thirty year--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --history.  I mean a thirty successful history with it.  And I'm sure that, you know, when you came out of medical school, even though you were a medical student, you had not envisioned, this  is what you would necessarily be doing.
Speaker 2: That's true.
Speaker 1: Right.  I want to, before I go to sort of the personal reflections on that, I want to see if there are--well I want to know what you  want to do going forward.  What do you feel that you haven't done?  That you would be interested in going--and doing going forward.  I know you're writing--.
Speaker 2: I'm going to say something that is very genuine but can from a 73 year-old man can sound frivolous.  I still don't know what I wanna do when I grow up.  I really mean that. I don't know.  I wanna continue to try to make an impact, to try to make changes.  I wanna continue on what I'm doing, certainly in writing.  But I don't know what the future holds.  No, I did not envision myself quotes "working in corporations."  I knew I'd do something--I knew I would do something that would get me out there to try to be making some changes, you know.  And part of being a psychiatrist I thought would provide me with that.  I just didn't know what that was.  So, I really don't know.  All I know is as long as, you know, my health is good and the brain functions that I'll be out there doing something.

Speaker 1: With your book, the book that you're doing now, 'From Rage to Entitlement,' that's the working title, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What was the motivation behind that  book and doing it?
Speaker 2: I had put together a lot of material around my work.  And I showed it to a guy whom I trust, a senior editor of a publishing company.  His company was not gonna publish it so he was doing this as a friend.  And I showed it to another friend of mine who was--had been a magazine editor.  And they both thought, "Price, you got a lot of material in here.  But you need to hang it on a chronology of your life."  And it made me--at first it was a little bit too formidable.  I thought of autobiography and, you know, oh my God, you know, what do I leave out?  What do I put in?  Then, they said, "No, No, we're talking about a memoir and what had been some of the events that have come up in your life?"  And then I started thinking, yeah, it's really a chronicle from my vantage point of the three fourths of the last century.  I was born in 1928.  I impacted and was impacted by things. I marched the last day at Selma [Alabama].  I worked with Southern Christian Leadership Conference after Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated.  [Andrew] Andy Young asked me to come and work with him.  I've worked in corporations.  I've been into and around things.  So that it's, you know--James Baldwin used to talk about kind of bearing witness.  It would be somewhere around there chronicling, just looking at some of the things that I have seen through the lens of race and through the lens of race does not mean narrowly.  For me the lens of race has allowed me to broaden things, to make things much broader rather than smaller. It has allowed me--the better I have understood who I am, the more multicultural I can be come. You know.  The more accepting I can become.  So it didn't--understanding myself and my culture doesn't make me some narrow nationalistic person.  So that when I say, "Through the lens of race," it's through the lens of race, it's through the lens of being an American, it's through the lens of being a man, it's through the lens of being a psychiatrist, through the lens of being a westerner and growing up in L.A. [Los Angeles, California] at a particular time.  So all of that and then the various events that have that occurred.

Speaker 1: I don't know what you--if you have an answer to this question.  But I was thinking about your father [Peter Price Cobbs] and I was wondering if you had ever thought it--if you had the occasion to treat your father as a patient?  Not that he would have been, you know, one of your patients. What would you be, you know, I don't know what my question is but--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --it's just that--.
Speaker 2: My father, I got in touch with, the concept of rage by trying to understand my father.  My father had an edge.  He was a very elegant man, but he had an edge.  And to say it was anger and rage makes it clinical.  You know, I never--I don't think I ever saw my father lose his temper.  I saw my mother [Rosa Ellen Mashaw Cobbs] lose hers, but my father had an edge.  And I'd say every now and then a button would be pushed and he would show me more of what that edge was.  So that it would be less if I were treating my father as much as, as two adults--if I were having a conversation with my father, I would want to know where that came from.  And then it would get closer to what you were talking about.  "What informed your politic abuse?"  Because I'm certain the two things are intertwined.

Speaker 1: When you think of yourself as a curious child that you were, and curiosity I think has been a constant--,
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --theme in your, you know, your life and your life search.  Do you think that--I mean how would you--how is that little child, the little Price and the 73-year-old Price?  How do they differ, given your life's journey?
Speaker 2: They don't differ--older, hopefully wiser.  Still very curious, child-like in my curiosity.  Get very passionate and enthusiastic about things.  Wanna see--every situation is fresh.  So in that sense the little boy is still there.  The little boy has better judgment, certainly has a wider knowledge of things, people, the way the world works.  But the little boy is still there.  Still wanting to know what's in there.  What makes her tick, what makes him tick, you know?  How is this project gonna go?  The little boy is still there. Just, you know, a little bit--doesn't have quite the energy or the stamina, but the little boy is still there.

Speaker 1: What do want your legacy to be, sir?
Speaker 2: I don't, I don't know.  You know, legacy came up so much with [U.S. President Bill] Clinton, and so I think a lot of us have thought about it.  I think your work and people's response to it determine one's legacy.  I don't--you know, so that in that sense I don't know that I really think about what my legacy would, be.  I see myself as a marathoner that--I see myself as a marathoner.  As a long-distance runner.  So if there would be, it would be, you know, the brother hung in there.  You know, that when I first started, I know people thought I was riding some racial hobbyhorse. or, you know--"This will last about a year or two or whatever."  Well it's lasted for over thirty years.  So, you know.  I guess, he--you know, "The brother hung in there.  You know, he done good." (laughs)
