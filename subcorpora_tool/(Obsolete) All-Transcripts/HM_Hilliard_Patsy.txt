Story_ID: 618105
Speaker 1: Okay, let's start by talking about your, your father. Tell me his name, when and where he was born.
Speaker 2: Elmer Dudley Morrison II [Elmer Morrison II], and he was born in Denver, Colorado.
Speaker 1: Do you know what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen seventeen [1917].
Speaker 1: And did he share any stories about him, his growing up?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately not, because his father was born in New York [New York]. And he never talked much about his uncles and aunts. I don't even know if he had, if the father had relatives. I knew about his father's mother, Grandma Archer [ph.], which was my great-grandmother. And I used to have frequent conversations with her on the telephone, but I never had the privilege of meeting her. But daddy came to Denver, was born in Denver. And so I'm a second generation Denverite.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: And he has sisters. He was the middle child. He had two sisters.
Speaker 1: Do you know their names?
Speaker 2: Mary Frances and Jacquelyne Rhodes [Jacquelyne Morrison Rhodes], Jacquelyne Rhodes, Mary Frances Beckam [Mary Morrison Beckam] was the oldest, and then, then dad and then Jackie Rose. Jackie lives in Kansas City [Missouri] now. And his older sister is deceased. And of course his parents [Margaret Green and Elmer Morrison I] are no longer living.
Speaker 1: So he didn't talk any about his growing up in Denver?
Speaker 2: Well in Denver. He talked a lot about growing up Denver. I'm sorry, I thought--I didn't understand your question (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yes, he, he talked about wanting to see the world and how he, he and a friend decided to take a trip on the train, a hobo. You know where you'd go and hop on trains and that was exciting. And they'd get off and they'd go in and meet the people in the city and--but he ended up back in Denver. And I'm happy he did because he met my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] (laughter). He worked at a pharmacy 'cause he used to always talk about that because he, and he made pretty good money. And he wanted to be a pharmacist. But then he, his uncles worked on the railroad. And it was good money in the summer. And with tips and all, so he decided that he was gonna do this along with two or three of his friends. And of course that was his career as a chair car attendant. And so he often told my brother [Elmer Morrison III] and I this because he said you know you really need to decide what it is you wanna do and pursue it and don't let anything change your mind, and particularly money. Because money cannot buy you happiness.
Speaker 1: Do you know how much education your father had?
Speaker 2: He went through high school.
Speaker 1: And explain what a, a chair car attendant is.
Speaker 2: It's a porter, a porter who takes care of the passengers on the train. And I can just see daddy now because my brother and I would sometimes go down to the station to meet him when he was coming in. And we'd watch him. He'd get off the train first and he'd let the step down so the passengers could get off. And he'd always say, "Watch your step, take your time. Watch your step, take your time." (Laughter) And we used to tease him about that. And the other thing is we would take a trip, my brother and I, on the train going to Los Angeles [California] to visit my grandparents [Ida Martin and Jesse Martin], my mother's parents. And of course we had our lunch for the train. And there was a little compartment on the train where you could put cold drinks and you'd keep them cold. And so they really have that fixed up for, for me and for my brother, but what we wanted to do was to share it with the other passengers. So we would spend our time, particularly the people sitting next to us, asking if they'd like a Coke [Coca-Cola] or a Pepsi or with pillows, you know how the porter would pass out pillows and usually people would give them a tip. But because we had pillows, we wanted everybody sitting around us to have pillows. So we soon got a lecture from my father that, you know, this is a service that I'm providing you, not everybody sitting around you (laughter). But we loved to travel with him on the train, and we would--my mother had us practice before we made our first trip. And we'd put chairs in a row and so we sat there and we were told how you ask for things and what you do when you go in the dining car and I think in those days everybody knew everyone, all the porters knew the waiters and so they took very good care of us in the dining room. We had as much food as we wanted, and as often as we wanted it. So it was wonderful. It was exciting to hear about his adventure on the railroad.
Speaker 1: Did he tell you any stories about something that might have happened, you know something like you said, exciting that might have happened while he was traveling?
Speaker 2: Well he talked about people who were always asking, "Porter, where are we? What is that?" You know, "That's the, the Great Salt Lake," you know. It could just be a big body of water that was not necessarily the Salt Lake. But you know it just shows you how sometimes people really don't know and they'll accept what anybody says. And I think because they ask so many questions, and so many questions it seemed--that didn't make sense to him that he would just make up anything he said (laughter), and that's what he and a lot of the buddies, and then they would laugh about, you know, what they told a person.
Story_ID: 618106
Speaker 1: Now traveling, well we'll talk more about your traveling 'cause I wanna continue talking about your family tree. And you talked about your, your [paternal] grandmother and your grandfather. Well, let's go to your, your Great-Grandmother Archer [ph.]. Talk to me about her.
Speaker 2: Yeah, now she is the one that I really, I just talked to her on the phone and I was so proud to be able to tell my friends that I had a great-grandmother. And so, and she would just ask me about school because I was quite young when I used to have those conversations with her. And she'd ask about my brother [Elmer Morrison III] and she'd ask about our neighborhood and what kind of activities we did. And I remember that, and it's, it's really vague. I know my aunt, my father's [Elmer Morrison II] sister, had an opportunity to meet her because she went to school at Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]. And when she graduated, my mother--my grandmother took her to meet my great-grandmother. And so I sometimes you know was able to hear from her about how Grandma Archer actually looked, and how attractive she was and how she had, she was very inquisitive about the family and the kinds of activities that, that we did in Colorado.
Speaker 1: Where did she live?
Speaker 2: She was in New York City [New York, New York]. But my grandmother, my father's mother, of course was in Denver [Colorado]. And she married again. Her, her--my father's father and mother divorced and they both married again and I always tell my children how fortunate I felt I was because I had several sets of grandparents. My mother's mother [Ida Martin] and father [Jesse Martin], and then my father's mother and father who both married again. And it was really quite exciting when we had celebrations, birthday and all, everybody came. And you would never know that we never talked about step. You know they were just all a part of the family. And of course I did hear my grandmother say once, she says you know, "I'm really sorry that your grandfather and I can't be enjoying the grandchildren together. You know it would really be good to be able to do this together and not with our respective husbands or wives at the time." And so you know one of the lessons that she did tell me too about divorce is she said you know, "I used to listen to my friends, and they would say you know, 'Your husband, you complain about your husband drinking and on payday he'd come home late.' But he always brought his money home. He always brought his money, but you know there was maybe once a month that on payday that he wouldn't come home right away." And so she said she listened to that and decided that she was going to divorce him because she didn't want somebody who did that. And then as ne- as soon as she divorced, she found out that her friends' husbands were doing it worse than granddad (laughter). And so she said you know you must never listen. It has to be what is going on in your home, and you don't listen to idle gossip from friends because you think they have your, your, your life in their hands or, or they care about you and oftentimes that's not really the case. But it's funny how you hear things like that that carry on. You never forget those different comments.
Speaker 1: Let, let's go back and clarify the, the names. Your mother, your grandmother, your father's mother. What was her name?
Speaker 2: Margaret Green.
Speaker 1: And your grandfather's name?
Speaker 2: Elmer Dudley Morrison I [Elmer Morrison I].
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you said that Margaret remarried.
Speaker 2: She married James Green.
Speaker 1: And Elmer.
Speaker 2: Married Edith [Edith Morrison], who was from Wyoming. His--yeah, she was from Wyoming.
Story_ID: 618107
Speaker 1: So besides the, the con- the other con- that conversation you just talked about with your [paternal] grandmother [Margaret Green], did you have a, a really good relationship with her? Because they lived in Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 2: Yes, wonderful relationship. My grandmother--I remember each child that I had, my grandmother was always the one who came to the house and helped me with the baby and helped with the laundry. And the thing I enjoyed best is that she'd always fix a great lunch for me. And she was just wonderful. So when my last child [M. Hakim Hilliard] was born in Liberia, I wrote her and I said, "Now you have to come" (laughter), "you can't stop this. You have to come to Liberia." And of course she said, "No. I'm sorry, you're gonna have to go it alone there. I don't care about traveling that far." But she was just a won- she was, she was an usher in her church. She was a Baptist, went to New Hope Baptist Church [Denver, Colorado]. And I went with her to see Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] speak shortly after I was married [to HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III]. I remember it was the same month because I remember wearing the dress that I wore--you know how you have your, your wedding dress and then you have your outfit to travel in, and I remember wearing that outfit to church with my grandmother to see Dr. King and I was so, I was so happy that she took me. She had let--you know that he was gonna be at her church. And I think probably the reason I usher at my church now is because of my grandmother, because she talked so much about it. And she used to talk about how ushers have signals. You know, if somebody needs a, a fan or an envelope or something, there were certain signals. So I keep trying to tell my members (laughter) in my, on my usher board that we need some signals. But I, I just had a wonderful relationship with her. She liked to go to the dog races. We had dog races in Denver. And so I--in my summer job when I would get home, I would get, I guess maybe one child at that time, and off to the races we'd go. I'd pick my grandmother up and we'd go and I loved to go because they had great hotdogs there and sodas. And I--she would go, we'd spend maybe about an hour or two and come home and I always looked forward to that. I also liked to go to the--looking for--what do you call it--to junking. When you go to these shops to get old dishes and cups, because she used to play bridge every week. She had a foursome. And she also said to me that you don't have to match your dishes all the time, you know, you can have a different plate and a different cup and your nice tablecloth. And so she would always go and shop to get all these things for her, for her ladies for bridge. And so when I--and I went to high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] just not far from where she lived. So sometimes I would leave school and go and have lunch with her friends. And you know the other thing, I could wear my grandmother's clothes. And she had just really youthful dresses. And you know I would almost be too embarrassed to say that was my grandmother's dress (laughter), but it was very nice and I loved wearing her clothes.
Speaker 1: Did you grow up--do you know about your grandmother's education?
Speaker 2: She just finished high school.
Speaker 1: Did she work outside of the home?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she worked. They had an Air Force finance center [Air Force Accounting and Finance Center; Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver, Colorado] or something in, in Colorado and I remember she worked, she worked there.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what did her husband do?
Speaker 2: Now Papa Jimmy [Hilliard's paternal step-grandfather, James Green], he worked at a foundry. He must have been a supervisor or foreman or something because I know people would borrow money from him. And oftentimes when I was at their house, they would come and they would give him things to hold 'til he got the money. And so they had all kinds of weird things (laughter) around the house that maybe somebody brought and said, "If you just keep this for me. And as soon as I get the money, I will come back and get it." And we used to laugh about that. You know he might have a really fancy axe and a, an ornate pail. Just things that I guess were valuable to the owner. And Papa Jimmy would trust them. And it was a big foundry 'cause I know every now and then he would take my brother and I out to this foundry and now don't ask me what it was they made. But we used to go out with him and see what--supervise the, the men. And he also liked to fish. And so Buddy [Elmer Morrison III] and I liked to go with him fishing. And my brother still likes to fish. I don't care much about fishing. I couldn't get past putting the bait on the--but Papa Jimmy loved to fish and so oftentimes you know when he got home from work and we'd have dinner, off we'd go to--with him to fish.
Speaker 1: Did their, did they own their own home?
Speaker 2: Yes. And by the way, the Green family, they were funeral--they owned a funeral home in Missouri. And I remember it was a Green, Green and Sons [ph.]. And so he had a couple of brothers who ran the funeral home in Missouri. And we'd been there to visit and I remember going in to the place where you keep the caskets and all, and so then I'd say, "Well, now how do you tell--how much is that? And how much is that?" And so he'd just take the sign and move it over. In other words, this--it's whatever I want it to be (laughter). And that is--and then I also saw how they dress the bodies, you know. I never, I mean I never realized that they didn't wear a complete outfit, but that they're just--you know, parts that show. So I had a good education on funeral directors in visiting his family.
Story_ID: 618108
Speaker 1: All right, and now to your grandfather and his wife. They were your second set of grandparents on your father's [Elmer Morrison II] side (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right, that's my dad's side. Yeah, and his--the thing I remember about Grandpa Morrison [Elmer Morrison I] they called him, his wife was Edie. And a lot of times you know I'd call him and before I could even say hello, he'd say, "Yeah, just a minute, Edie's right here," you know, "she's right here, just hold on." (Laughter) So I had this--I'd say, "Grandpa, I'm calling to talk to you right now and I'll talk to Edie later." But he, he would always--I guess you know because he didn't want her to feel bad (laughter), so he would always say, "Yes, Edie's right here. She's very anxious to speak to you." But Grandpa lived right on the route to school and I would always stop at his house to visit he and Edith [Hilliard's paternal step-grandmother, Edith Morrison]. And I remember getting my first set of luggage when I graduated from high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] from him. He worked at the water plant, a water recycling, not recycling, a water plant that provided water for Denver [Colorado]. And so of course I visited that with him and very good about taking us. I guess that's how I learn so much is to, you know, go around with family members, whatever they were doing. We had a full understanding what it was and we would have lessons when we got home on exactly what his responsibility was and how you always learn a little bit more, you go early, you stay later. It's not a big--just because you're (unclear) there at eight [o'clock], that doesn't mean that you get--show up at eight. If you got off at five, it doesn't mean that you leave right at five, you know so that, that kind of discipline with employment was something I really learned from him.
Speaker 1: And did his wife also work outside the home, Edith?
Speaker 2: No. Edith--wait, yes she did, she worked at a department store. She worked at the, goodness I cannot think of it, she worked at a department store downtown in Denver, and she was a maid because she was--you remember, well you don't remember, but a long time ago they would--in the ladies room they would have someone who would kind of tidy up and provide towels and that sort of thing. And that's what Edie did and she retired from there. I cannot remember the name of the, of the store, but it was there forever. And that's where she retired, because every time--if I go shopping, a part of our trip would always be to go up and see Edie.
Speaker 1: And what about, excuse me, your grandfather's education? Do you know about how far he went in school?
Speaker 2: He finished high school. And he finished in New York [New York]. But I just never--it was just really interesting how he never really talked about his family, you know. He recognized his mother. I don't believe, I don't believe that he went to his mother's funeral. I was quite young. But I don't believe that he did. So I'm not sure. I don't know what happened and I never--every now and then we have kind of tried to look back and trace the family and I think my Aunt Jackie [Jacquelyne Morrison Rhodes] knows some more and my daughter Trisha [Patricia Hilliard Nunn] is kind of our family historian. So she's beginning to collect, you know, information. But unfortunately I just don't--every time I go to New York and I meet somebody and I'd say, "Do you know any Morrisons" (laughter)? I found out there's a lot of Morrisons, but they're not related to me.
Story_ID: 618109
Speaker 1: So your Great-Grandmother Archer [ph.] was Elmer's mother?
Speaker 2: Yes, Elmer I [Hilliard's paternal grandfather, Elmer Morrison I].
Speaker 1: The first, yes.
Speaker 2: And her maiden name was Thomas [ph.]. And her father, she was, she moved to New York [New York] from Illinois. And she was the first juror on the Illinois jury commission, or jury, served on a jury for--the first African American to do that. And her father established a school for black children in Illinois, and there's still evidence of that, it's Robert Thomas [ph.]. And apparently just before my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] passed, he got a note from a gentleman in Chicago [Illinois] who's doing research on my grandfather. And I said that, you know, I--along that time my husband passed and I haven't had time to look into it. But we know that there are remnants of, of this school. And that there's some people who know about, it was a school for black children in, in Chicago. But his name was Robert Thomas.
Speaker 1: All right. Anything else you wanna talk about? Your grandparents or great-grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well, just the fact that I think it was--we were just fortunate, I was fortunate to have so many. And I tell my children, you know, because now like my husband did not--none of his grandparents were living. And so it was so--and see and now with my children, my father's [Elmer Morrison II] not living, my mother's [Jessie Martin Morrison] not living. Some of the children met one or the other. But it was not like I mean I felt like I was really very special to have so many. And I, and I think I learned so much from them. And I think during those days, they had time to really talk to you about things. And I think the way society moves now, it's so fast that you don't get to have those really valuable conversations with, with your older family members. You know either you're, you're old fashioned or--and I keep thinking that when my [paternal] grandmother [Margaret Green] used to talk about, "This is the end of the world," because of different things that were happening. "And I knew that, you know, that they shouldn't be going to the moon and all that because that's just changing the weather," and you know, but now I find myself saying those same things (laughter). And I don't think there's ever been a time that we've had so many changes in society. I mean they're just--I mean you know it's one thing going from farming to the industrialization, but--and that was probably big for them at that time. But I don't think we've ever had a time quite like this, you know, in society with things going on. So--and I think probably it's even more important that we talk to our children about it. But I feel fortunate that my grandparents talked to me. My grandfather [Jesse Martin], even though he worked at the shops, my mother's father, he was a teacher. He'd been a--he taught at a normal school. And so he recognized that.
Story_ID: 618110
Speaker 1: Before we go to your mother's [Jessie Martin Morrison] side, I just wanna talk to you about, or for you to talk to us about your relationship with your father [Elmer Morrison II].
Speaker 2: Okay, well--
Speaker 1: And let me ask you what characteristic do you think that you, you gained from your father?
Speaker 2: Well, when I think about what I do now, I can see a lot of traits that he had that I have. But I know one thing, he would tell me you always tell the truth. You know you never--because if you tell one lie, you're gonna have to tell another and another and another to get out of it. And the thing that I think of so vividly, and it has to do with my husband. I was maybe dating a couple of other people at the same time I was dating my husband to be. And I, I think Asa [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] was in the [U.S. military] service or something, he had just come back. And I was going off with another guy and I told my father not to tell him (laughter), you know, 'cause--and when I got home, I felt so bad because he said, "Well, Asa was just here. And I just told him, I told him what happened, that you'd been going with this young man, and you already had this date planned." And I thought daddy was the worse person in the world. But that's true. Because as he explained to me, you see, if you tell one lie, then you have to tell another and another and it's, it's never ending. So I just always trusted daddy. I, I used to think when the war [Vietnam War] was going on and they were dropping bombs, I imagined that my father could go out in the yard and catch the bombs. I mean that's how strong and, and--that I thought he was. And I, I have to laugh about that now when I think about, you know, my--but I think that's how children are. You know you think your parents can do everything. And that's what I thought about dad. I mean he would just--he, he was in two days and out one day, so I knew exactly his trip, his traveling on the railroad. So I knew when he was gonna be in and I was always excited. And he could make good oatmeal, good Cream of Wheat with no lumps in it (laughter). And so I always liked him to fix breakfast because I always ate it all 'cause my mother would get kind of lumps in the, in the cereal, but daddy could make really good. And the other thing I liked is taking a bath after him because growing up, we had one bathroom in our house. And I loved to go in after my father because the whole bathroom was spotless. I mean he cleaned the tub so good (laughter). And so I like kind of tell my children that now because he, you know he was just, he was just, just a wonderful person.
Story_ID: 618111
Speaker 1: All right tell me about your mother. Tell me her name when and where she was born.
Speaker 2: Okay. Her name was Jessie Almeta Martin Morrison [Jessie Martin Morrison], and she was born in Claremore, Oklahoma. But she moved to Denver [Colorado] when I think she was about three or four months old. And I think she had to move because she said my grandmother [Ida Martin] had asthma and they recommended that they come to Denver. And so that's why she came. So she really never knew much about Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: What year was she born?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighteen [1918].
Speaker 1: Now did she share any stories about her growing up in Denver?
Speaker 2: Well she was a very--now mom was tricky. See, she had a lot of stories that she would use to teach. And sometimes as I'm older now, I'm not sure that they were all true. You know how she'd tell you stories about how you have to look up the street and down the street before you cross the street because I knew this little boy who didn't do that and he looked, he didn't look and he was--so she's always, she's always used examples like that to teach. But my mother was very beautiful, and she had bright red hair. And she finished high school. But she finished college at the same time, around the same time I did because she did wigs. And she did such a good job that people were coming to her and not going to their beauticians. So someone reported her. And she had to go to school and get her degree (laughter) in doing hair.
Story_ID: 618112
Speaker 1: So continue telling me about your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay well mom [Jessie Martin Morrison] was a good role model. I mean she was every place I was. I never went to anything that mom wasn't there because she was the sponsor of our Camp Fire group. And so every party or any, anything, mom was there. So everybody knew my mother. But she, when she started this, this hair business, she was so good and people could--and see she was doing wigs before they were cut for shape. I mean it was just a piece of hair. And she could style it and it looked exactly like a person's hair. So then you can imagine when the wigs came out that were already cut, but she would never have a person put it on just as is. She would always shape it and all. So people then stopped going to their regular beauticians because mom actually had a charm school [Jessie Morrison's School of Charm (ph.)]. And she was the first African American model in Denver [Colorado]. And when she took the course, she at that time was sponsoring the Camp Fire Girls [Camp Fire Girls of America; Camp Fire], so we all took a course with her. And you know I still run into people now who remember mom. And I was just--just recently telling somebody that I wanted my granddaughter to get in a school, not for modeling, but just for their own, her own--to feel good about herself. And someone said, "Oh, that's what your mother did," you know. So it makes me feel good that there's some people who, who do remember that. But she was great. She, she made me feel that I could do anything I wanted to do. She was a good people person. She loved people and she said you know anything that you want to do, you can do it. And you just study. She was a little bit before her time in terms of trying to get people--like she'd tell my dad [Elmer Morrison II], "You need a hobby" (laughter). And dad would think, I don't have time to have a hobby. And she'd say, "But you need--see you just--it's in the book. You just, you can read it and you can do this and you can do that." She was just very talented. I can remember she would sew. And I remember her making a felt skirt for me; those were real popular with the, the beveled, the hem of a felt skirt and then you put appliques on it. And I would--and, and sequins. And I remember one night I was just crying because she insisted that I had to help and my brother [Elmer Morrison III] helped her. And I'm crying, I wanted to go to bed and she wouldn't let me (laughter). When she got her mind on--but then after, you know I was very thankful that she did it. But I think--and I don't sew now because mom didn't have a sewing room. Her sewing room was the dining room table, which is where you had to eat. And all her patterns and everything. So that just--god, I couldn't stand that. "Mom is sewing again." So, and you were not allowed to move anything. So I think that's when those TV tables came in because we always ate on TV tables because we couldn't sit at the table because mom had all of her work there. But she, she became the chairman of this Girl Scout--because I had a little Japanese friend in elementary school, Carol Hagahara [ph.], I'll never forget. She was my very best friend. And we decided we wanted to be in the club because my mother was always going to club meetings and I wanted to go to a club meeting. So we started a club, we called it the All American Junior Girl Club [ph.], and our colors were red, white and blue. And we got one of our teachers at Whittier Elementary School [Whittier ECE-8 School, Denver, Colorado], which was the school in my neighborhood, we asked the teacher to be our sponsor. She is the one who looked into the Camp Fire Girls and the Bluebirds and we were just too old for the younger group, so we became Camp Fire Girls. And so this lady, Ms. Blanchard [ph.] I think, she started out. And then she talked my mother and the mother of another friend, and they became co-leaders. And we used to go to camp, we'd go to day camp, we'd go to the two week camp. And my mother was just all--we were the only black group in Denver. And I still have a very good friend now, Lorraine [ph.], who lives in California and I just heard from her the other day 'cause she wants us to get together. But we stayed friends. Her mother was a leader too of another group in another part of Denver. And we just stayed friends. And we had a special song, it was about, "Burn fire burn, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker flame." And we'd always sing that around our campfires. And my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] would always tease me with that song, you know (laughter). The Camp Fire Girls. But mom just did everything. And I think I just wanted to be like her, you know. But she--the other thing is she kind of used me as a guinea pig when it came to hair because there was a time when colored hair, they used to do pink and blue and all different colors. And she'd have the fashion show and I, even after marriage, I was, would still model for her. And I finally had to say, "Mom, I do not want to be in cabaret on a Sunday anymore. I wanna be able to spend the time with my family." And I think mom was really a little insulted by that. But I have friends who stayed with her and did the shows and--but I think I learned, you know I learned a lot from just trying to do the best--look the best I could, take care of myself, take care of my skin. And I was traveling with a friend the other day and she said that I told her about how to do a facial because my mother had taught me. So we were in Liberia together and I used to do facials for Ann [ph.], (laughter) so.

Speaker 1: Let me ask you, here let's go, go back a little bit. What was the name of your mother's [Jessie Martin Morrison] charm school?
Speaker 2: Jessie Morrison's School of Charm [ph.].
Speaker 1: All right. And why did--was there not a Girl Scout [Girl Scouts of the United States of America]--the Camp Fire Girls [Camp Fire Girls of America; Camp Fire] and the Girl Scouts are two different things.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was there a reason why it wasn't Girl Scouts and Camp Fire Girls was chosen, or do you know?
Speaker 2: You know I, I'm not sure. It could be that at time, maybe there--maybe they were not letting black girls into Girl Scouts. You know I'm not sure because when I came back to the states after living in Liberia, I wanted my girls to be Camp Fire Girls. And we were in San Francisco [California] then. And I couldn't find any group in my neighborhood. But then I realized that you can't force a person, you know you can only take so many people in your home if you're doing it in your home. And so I'm thinking I can't get mad at this lady 'cause I actually called and they said, "Well, I'm sorry, you know we don't have room." And I, I--it dawned on me that that's her privilege, you know. If I wanna do it, I need to start my own group, which I didn't (laughter). The girls did become Girl Scouts, but I just didn't have the same attachment to that because I had all my badges and medals from Camp Fire Girls and that's what I want them to be. But no there was no other reason except that apparently that's what this teacher researched and found, you know the Camp Fire Girls, so that's what we joined.
Speaker 1: And also with your mother's modeling, did she have professional training as a model (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Do, do you know where?
Speaker 2: Yes, she went to John Robert Powers [John Robert Powers Modeling School] and Barbizon Modeling School [Barbizon Modeling and Acting School], and that's where my granddaughter, I just started my granddaughter at Barbizon here in Atlanta [Barbizon of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 1: So Barbizon was using black models back in that time?
Speaker 2: Yes, not that many, but yes. And John Robert Powers in Denver [Colorado].
Speaker 1: And your mother's makeup, you said she was very, very beautiful, but was she very fair skinned?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: No?
Speaker 2: Well, she was a little--she wasn't my color, she was perhaps a little lighter than, than I am.
Story_ID: 618114
Speaker 1: And you also said that she [Hilliard's mother, Jessie Martin Morrison] went to a lot of club meetings. Now you said that your grandmother [Margaret Green] on your father's [Elmer Morrison II] side played bridge.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Did you ever learn how to play bridge?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter). I, I play. I don't think many people want me in their clubs (laughter), but I decided and I do play. And I remember one time going to play bridge and when I got home, I was sick. I had the worse headache. And my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] said, "Well, why do you do that if you get sick?" But you know I got--I was so nervous. So then I developed this new deal. I said, "Okay, if someone asks me, I'm gonna go." And so I go and I'd sit at the table and I'd say to the people, you know, "I'm really not that good, but--," or how did I say it? Because I figure most, many people were just like me, but they just didn't say. So the minute I said you know, "Don't worry about it," I think that's what happened. They said to me, "I hope you don't--are not one who gets angry." I said, "No, it's just a game," you know. And when I developed that, then I did better. And I--because I was more relaxed. And then I saw other people made mistakes just like I did. And then I said well if they wanted an expert player, they shouldn't invite me. This is party bridge. You know they should do the duplicate, which I would never agree to go play duplicate because I don't play that well. So--but my mother, she played, she played Tripoley. You know I, I--you know and you never hear much about that game. Do you know what that is (laughter)? They--she played Tripoley and spades and things like that and I know they used to have--she and dad would have people at the house doing that. I don't believe--mom might have played bridge. I just can't remember. I just remember my grandmother more with the bridge. I'm not sure if mom played, but I remember them playing Tripoley.
Speaker 1: Do you know, do you know what--how--
Speaker 2: It was a card game too, but no, I don't. As a matter of fact I'm still--I still have that game because of course I have, you know, still a lot of my mother's things.
Story_ID: 618115
Speaker 1: And your mother's charm school [Jessie Morrison's School of Charm (ph.)], was it--where was it located?
Speaker 2: It was in--she--it was in her home. And then she had a contract with the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association] in Denver [Colorado]. And so then she would have it there, yeah. And as a matter of fact, the person who was the head of the YMCA eventually moved to Atlanta [Georgia]. And he was the head of the YMCA here. Was he with--or he was in Maynard Jackson's administration. 'Cause I know he married my girlfriend--Franklin Thomas [Franklin M. Thomas]. He married my girlfriend who lived in Denver. She was a young teacher. And all of the women liked this Mr. Thomas and Jean Godding [ph.] (laughter). But Jean was special in her own right because she adopted--her sister who was deceased, adopted her two sons, who were just--they were very young. They were in elementary school and Jean was a young, new teacher, and adopted those children. And then some way or another she met Franklin and they married and moved here. But anyway, he had a lot to do with helping my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] in her career. 'Cause so then she spoke around at different schools and--on charm, fashion.
Speaker 1: So she would use the models from the different classes at the Y to do her fashion show?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was she ever involved in Fashion Fair [Ebony Fashion Fair]?
Speaker 2: No, she was not. That was probably a little bit--
Speaker 1: Later?
Speaker 2: Little bit--yeah. She was involved with Marguerite Belafonte who came to do a fundraiser in Denver. And at that time, we had a black lieutenant governor, Brown, George Brown [HistoryMaker George L. Brown]. And mom was involved in setting that show up with Marguerite Belafonte. So that was exciting. And I remember she used to work with the Jabberwock for the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.], and mom was not a sorority member. But she was working, setting their show up, they had a Jabberwock. It was like a big talent show used in all the sororities and fraternities in the city. And so of course she would dress me up and I would go down there, but I wasn't a part of the show. And she tells me about one time she was getting everything all set backstage and all, she looked up and there I came walking across the stage with one of my friends, who was in the show. I was not supposed to be in the show (laughter). So you know I got a good scolding for that. But she was just involved in, in everything; always helped people.
Story_ID: 618116
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay, so now tell me about her parents, your grandparents on your mom's [Jessie Martin Morrison] side. Tell me your grandmother's name.
Speaker 2: Ida Catherine Martin [Ida Martin], but I do not remember her maiden name.
Speaker 1: And was she, was she (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And grandpa was Jesse, Jesse Martin. Mama's named for him.
Speaker 1: And where were they born?
Speaker 2: Arkansas. Grandpa I know was born in Arkansas. My grandmother was born in Oklahoma.
Speaker 1: Now tell me your relationship, or did you have a relationship with them?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah we were all very close because when they--we lived in their house for two or three years when I was very young. And then they moved to California, to Los Angeles. And my father [Elmer Morrison II] bought their house. And I remember this big discussion because my mother had a sister who when her parents were there, it was like her house; it was like the family house. And I remember the discussion my dad had with my mother to say they're always welcomed, but this is our house now, it's not their family house. So and I guess those are kinds of conversations I guess that you need to have early because and dad said he kept trying not to say it, but then when he saw that, you know that they were assuming that it was like it was when her mother and father were there, that you know, he had to, had to let them know. But they moved to--because they couldn't take the weather in Denver [Colorado]. So they--Los Angeles of course is very nice, so they moved there. And my brother [Elmer Morrison III] and I, my very first trip on the train was to Los Angeles to visit my grandparents. And that was the very first time that I saw the ocean. And of course that was the time my mother got us all set and we practiced what we would do on the train and all going with dad 'cause he went all the way with us as far as Salt Lake [Salt Lake City, Utah]. And then we went on the rest, rest of the way ourselves. And my grandfather, I stayed with them when I went to school [Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California]. This was before I married. And my grandmother would--I would write letters. I was dating my husband to be at that time, but he was in the [U.S.] military. He was in Germany. And he would write these really interesting letters, and so grandpa could hardly wait for me to get a letter from Asa [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III]. And then I'd sit down at family time and read the letter and he told us all about the countryside and where he went and the people and all. And then he'd say, "Now did you write that boy yet? Better write that boy." He would get on me to--and the minute I put the letter down, he was off with it to the mailbox. So I'm so happy he had a chance to--they were still living you know when we, when we married.
Speaker 1: And what about your grandmother? What kind of relationship did you have with her?
Speaker 2: Very close. She was just a, you know it's like she was not there all the time. But when she was, you know when we were in California. I mean it was a close, close relationship.
Speaker 1: And what did your grandmother and grandfather do for a living?
Speaker 2: Well I, I can't remember--I remember grandpa worked. He had been a teacher in Oklahoma. And then when they moved, he worked at the shop, at the rail, the railroad shop. And it was quite a distance from where he lived because I used to always--remember how they carried the little lunch pails, how you could hardly--I can see him walking home. I'd always go to meet him. And then he--and he retired from there. So I'm not sure exactly. My grandmother was a maid. And she, you know and apparently in those times they'd have close relationships with the people for whom they worked. And were always bringing things home, clothes and shoes and, and things like that. And usually I guess in those days they stuck with one person. I mean you're not moving around from place to place. And so that's what, that's what she did.
Speaker 1: Do you know about their education?
Speaker 2: Well I know that they--well my father, my grandfather finished school to some--and I, I'm sure that I must have the record of it someplace because I have the diploma, so he went beyond high school. My grandmother just finished high school and she said, she talked about it being a one room school, you know with several grades in one class, meeting all at the same time.
Speaker 1: Now did your--you talked about your mother's sister. Did she have any other siblings?
Speaker 2: She had one sister who passed away at an early age and, and she had a daughter, she left a daughter that my grandparents adopted. And she too is no longer--her name was Shirley [Shirley Brown]. And she is no longer living. And then she--her sister, Aunt Lois [Lois Martin], she is no longer living.
Speaker 1: What was the first sister's name, do you remember?
Speaker 2: Ruby, Ruby, Ruby Martin [ph.], and then Lois, yeah. And she actually had a brother who died as a baby. And was he--he might have been Jesse, I think he was Jesse Martin [ph.].
Story_ID: 618117
Speaker 1: Now you told us about a lot of memories that you, that you have had, talking about your, your parents and your grandparents. But what is your earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Early like--?
Speaker 1: Whatever you can remember, the earliest memory you have.
Speaker 2: Well, I can almost remember going to the clinic with my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] as, you know almost just toddling. And her telling me about--and showing me a little baby. Well a little girl that--whose name was Patty Jo. And she had said that she saw her when she was born and how pretty she was. And she always said she wanted to have, she wanted to name her daughter Patricia, Patricia Joann [ph.], that's what it was, Patricia Joann. But then she said when I came, she thought I was such a little baby, that she would cut it, she didn't want such a long name. So that's how she named me Patsy Jo [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard]. And she showed me this little girl that happened to be in the neighborhood that she had named me for. And I can remember walking quite a distance to a--it was like a neighborhood clinic. And you'd see all the babies in there and I remember also with my Aunt Jackie [Hilliard's paternal aunt, Jacquelyne Morrison Rhodes], when Jackie would come home from school. She would take me around to visit the relatives. And she tells me later that, you know, because she was in school, she was always getting, not allowances, but they were happy that she was bringing me around so she'd get money. So she always wanted me to go with her so she could pay visits on the family, aunts and uncles, because my grandmother had four brothers.
Speaker 1: Which grandmother?
Speaker 2: Margaret Green, my dad's [Elmer Morrison II] mother. And they were--well one was in California, but Uncle Frank [ph.] was in Denver [Colorado] and Uncle Jade [ph.] and Uncle Clay [ph.]. And Uncle Willie [ph.] was in California. I, I knew him I guess when I was very young, but then he moved away to San Diego [California]. And so I didn't really know him that well, but uncle--the others I did. And so we would always go--I'd go with Jackie to visit the family. And of course I was the first grandchild. And one funny thing about that, I called my grandmother, daddy's mother, Sissy, because his--her brothers called her Sis. And so I--it just came out Sissy or Shissy. And it was so funny when Jackie, my aunt had two children [Roland Rhodes, Jr. and Carol Rhodes Dyson], they lived in Kansas City [Missouri]. And when they would come to Denver to visit, they'd always talking about Grandmother this, Grandmother that. And I tried to call her Grandmother, but I just couldn't (laughter). I said, "I'm sorry, I can't." I had to go back to Sissy because I felt like you know you're this big girl calling her Shissy, but Grandmother just didn't sound right to me.
Story_ID: 618118
Speaker 1: Tell me--you, you talked about your brother, but tell me his name and what does he do (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He--okay. He's Elmer Dudley Morrison III [Elmer Morrison III], and we call him Bud, Buddy and my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] used to always say that I was three pounds overweight and he was three pounds underweight. That I ate up his three pounds of food (laughter). And she--what was it--there was something I was just thinking about. She--mom said that I was, I Am and he was Me Too (laughter). That I'm always saying, "Mom, I'm gonna do so and so," and he'd say, "Me too." So she called us I Am and Me Too. But we would go to--my dad [Elmer Morrison II] had a friend who was a priest that gone to high school with him [at Manual Training High School; Manual High School, Denver, Colorado]. And he came back and he became the priest of Loyola Church in Denver [St. Ignatius Loyola Catholic Church, Denver, Colorado]. And it was about maybe ten blocks from our house. And so he talked them into having us take catechism. And so my brother and I would go early--when we went in the summer, we did go and take whatever you do during the summer. But then so when it was starting on Sunday morning, we were also A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] 'cause my grandmother went to the A.M.E. church and so I used to pass the plate and sing in the choir and all, little children's choir. So I didn't--at the Catholic church you couldn't do anything. You know I wanted to be doing things. So my brother and I would go to church, go to the catechism and then we'd get the bus 'cause the church was right at the end of the bus line, and we'd get the number 50 bus and ride back to our church, and then I'd go to church. My mother for the longest didn't know we were doing that (laughter). And then I would get to go and take the offering and stuff and then come home. And I finally said you know, I just--I can't do anything in that church, I wanna be busy. So that--my bro- and so he, I think he probably is the one who told on us. You know (laughter), "Mom, we didn't stay at the church. We went to the other church."
Speaker 1: What was the name of your A.M.E. church?
Speaker 2: Campbell, Campbell Chapel A.M.E. [Campbell Chapel A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado]. C-A-M-P-B-E-L-L, Campbell Chapel A.M.E.
Speaker 1: And did your mother and father attend that church as well (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yes, and my grandmother [Ida Martin] and grandfather [Jesse Martin]. And then they became Jehovah's Witnesses, my grand- my mother's parents when they moved to California. And so when I was there with them for a while, they--I used to go with them out with the Awake! and The Watchtower. And I'd go with them to their Sunday classes. And I had to laugh because when we moved to Liberia, one Saturday morning I had a knock on my door, and it was Jehovah's Witnesses. And I called my grandmother long distance. I said, "They're following me" (laughter). 'Cause she used to always say, "We're every place," you know, "we're all over the world." I said, "You're right."
Story_ID: 618119
Speaker 1: Now let's, let me ask you about your elementary school days and tell me what elementary school you attended.
Speaker 2: I went to Whittier Elementary School [Whittier ECE-8 School, Denver, Colorado], which was just around the corner. I could go right down the alley and right out to my school, which was great. That's when they had real, sho-nuf neighborhood schools. And course I was very active in this school. They had--my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] was always there, again, and I can remember her saying that she would never take a job that did not allow her to be free when there were programs going on with her children. And, and sure enough because see in those days, they had PTA [Parent Teacher Association] meetings at two o'clock in the afternoon. And how many of our parents were free to do that? But mom did and she used to work in the neighborhood grocery store near our house too before she got a job with the government finance center [Air Force Accounting and Finance Center; Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver, Colorado]. But it was just a wonderful time. We had a music teacher who--I was telling someone the other day that I learned all the military songs because in school then we had our music books, and we used to learn the Marine [U.S. Marine Corps], the [U.S.] Navy, all their songs. So now when I go to Fort McPherson [East Point, Georgia] and they play a medley of songs and I just get a tingle (laughter), 'cause I just love them. And we knew the words. And I remember Marian Anderson was a good friend of our music teacher, Jessie Maxwell [Jessie Whaley Maxwell]. So when she came to Denver [Colorado] to appear with the Denver Symphony Orchestra, she made it possible for us to go down to meet her. And that was just so exciting. Marian Anderson, just think, and of course years later I was able to meet Leontyne Price, but it was just--Mrs. Maxwell was just--she was like maybe one of only two or three African American teachers at the school. Then we had a PE [physical education] teacher who had dated my Aunt Jackie [Hilliard's paternal aunt, Jacquelyne Morrison Rhodes] because that was her major, physical education. But I think when they were--I don't know if that was in college or if they were just as they were growing up. But he used to always tell me, he says, "You know, I used to date your aunt." Mr. Cruder [ph.], everybody loved him. And, and you just--you know really--you fell in love with your teachers because you knew they cared about you and they loved you. As a matter of fact, I would do errands for my teacher. Sometimes she would give me the key to go to her house to get something and she'd leave, you know and I'd leave, go and get it and bring it back, you know. I mean it was just such a wonderful relationship. And the thing that I was so sad about is when my friend Carol Hagahara [ph.] had to go back to San Jose [California]. She always talked about San Jose, San Jose. And that's before I had ever been to California. But see she was with the Japanese, remember when they had to move because of war [World War II, WWII]. And so they spread out, you know, all over the U.S. A lot of them came to Denver. And I know her sister lived just one block from me. And so her sister and her husband and her mother and father, and so Carol and I were just and--I just remember crying so much when she left. And I think I've seen her a couple of times 'cause her sister still lives there, but then see I was in school and we just--I need to do that, whatever that thing is on the computer and try to look her up. 'Cause I--and I think she married, but that was just such a sad time for me because we would walk, we'd walk home from school together and then we'd stand on the corner before we'd split off and talk about--and one thing we talked about is parents and how we should report parents when they're mean to us (laughter). I sometimes think about that. I don't know what came up on the news, but we were saying you know, "We need to do that because sometimes my mother does things to me and I just don't like it and we need to tell." And when I think of what's going on now, you know how these children can report on any little thing. And I remember when Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] died and how sad we were, you know we talked about that.
Speaker 1: Tell me about--well first go back--let me understand. Did she have to go to California because of the war? Her family (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, it was over. See it was over. And so she was going home, and San Jose was home.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: And she always talked about San Jose, San Jose, and I don't know how much she could have known about it because we started kindergarten together. But I mean you know from her family, they had to pick up and move. And so then the time came that they could go back home. And so that's what I just, I just missed her so much. I didn't think I could go on (laughter) without her.
Story_ID: 618120
Speaker 1: What type of student were you?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), I'd like to think I was a good student. I was, I'd say average. I mean I wasn't an outstanding A student, but I, I did well. Yeah I mean I wasn't failing. Yeah, and see I tended to be more student council, friend, government related, wanting things to be better for everybody. So I was always in some kind of movement that you know, these lunches are not the best and at such and so school, I know they have so and so. So why can't we do that? And so then I was always in a leadership position. You know at that time they had class leaders, each, each classroom had a leader. Then the leader would go to a student council, which were leaders from each class. And then you'd--so that started in elementary school [Whittier Elementary School; Whittier ECE-8 School, Denver, Colorado]. And then I went to junior high school and I was like the president of the student body in junior high school. Then I went to high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado]. And I ran for head girl, but I didn't win.
Speaker 1: Let, let's go back to--well we talked a lot about your elementary school days and, and we talked about the teachers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Started the club [All American Junior Girl Club (ph.)] and the teachers.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what junior high school did you go to?
Speaker 2: I went to Cole, C-O-L-E, Cole Junior High School [Denver, Colorado]. And it's still there. And it was about--that was about twenty--well it was on 32nd [32nd Avenue; Martin Luther King, Jr. Boulevard]. I lived on 23rd [Avenue], and it was on 32nd, and I walked there and back every day. That was before school buses. And I met all the people up and down the street, and that was fun you know 'cause you see people sitting out on the porch and doing different things. And I, and, and a long time ago if someone died, they put a crepe on the door. So you knew that someone had passed away. So when I'd see that and, and usually many times I knew 'em, knew who it was. And then I'd go up. So then the next time I'd come, I told my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] I have to take some--a cake or some milk or things like that. And then she would--I would take things from home to those families, you know to say I'm sorry. You know and, and then my mother had to say that, "You have to ask me now because you--I just bought that bread for whatever. And you didn't ask me. So I don't mind you doing that, but let me know ahead of time because we have to plan," you know, so. But I--that's how I met my--met the neighbors. Just, you know, waving to 'em as I'm going down the street, and you know you miss that now because nobody's home. And so you could go up and down the street and never see anybody. But from, from 23rd to 32nd, I walked back and forth every, every day. So that was seventh to ninth [grade].
Story_ID: 618121
Speaker 1: On your way to school, or in your neighborhood that you grew up in, tell me--first of all, tell me the street that you--where you lived.
Speaker 2: I lived at 2345 Lafayette Street.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And guess what? That was the same street that Mamie Doud [Mamie Eisenhower] lived on. Mamie Doud was Eisenhower's [President Dwight David "Ike" Eisenhower] mother-in-law [sic. wife]. And--but she lived on probably 1st [Avenue] or 2nd [Avenue] (laughter) and Lafayette. And I used to always tell people that I lived on the same street (laughter), Mamie Doud's mother [Elivera Carlson Doud], but I'm on the 2300 block, and she's like 2nd or 3rd [Avenue]. But that was kind of fun (laughter). But it was right in, it was interesting in, in Denver [Colorado], and it's probably true in most cities, that African Americans lived in a certain area. And then they began to move east. So if a person lived on Race, boy they had really arrived because that's about five or six blocks over from Lafayette. And then if they were on York [Street], boy, that was really something. I have a girlfriend who moved to Gaylord [Street]. And I mean she was just really--her father still lives there now. We laugh about that. And then it just went on out. The City Park [Denver, Colorado] is on--out that--the big, the big park and so that's how you--golly, they live on Race Street. And the churches would move as the people moved, as the population moved. And the--but my church didn't move, the Campbell [Campbell Chapel A.M.E. Church, Denver, Colorado]--it stayed there. And I think it's still there. But now when I go back, a lot of the churches have moved and that's one thing I really respect about Atlanta [Georgia]. Because when I first moved here, I found that even though people lived all over, the churches stayed put, like Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia] and Big Bethel [Big Bethel A.M.E. Church, Atlanta, Georgia], and they all--I just, you know, think that's nice 'cause everybody can't afford to move out. So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Tell me about the, about some of the people. You said you met the neighbors. Tell me about some of the people who lived in the neighborhood and if you had any other friends and what, if you knew the occupations their parents had.
Speaker 2: Well that was another good thing because the doctors and the lawyers and the teachers all lived in the same neighborhood. And so you knew they cared about you and so you saw them at times other than when you were sick 'cause you didn't have a lot of doctors. And you didn't have a lot of dentists, but they lived in your neighborhood, or they went to church with you. And I think that that just had a lot to do with my gaining respect for them and for the profession and for wanting to be able to do something like they're doing, to help other people. It was never the money part, but it was always wanting to be in the position to provide information to people and tell people things that maybe they don't already know. I mean I can find out about it and let 'em know. Goodness, and I still have, I have many friends--well the, the former mayor of Denver [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb] and the former mayor of Seattle [Washington] and I went to the same high school, went to Manual High School [Denver, Colorado]. And I always laugh, I say I'm a few years older, but that was great because we--out of that same high school in our neighborhood, we all became mayors. But Norm [HistoryMaker Norman Rice], when he graduated, he moved to Seattle. His parents [Irene Johnson Powell and Otha Rice, Sr.] divorced, I remembered 'cause we were all sad that he moved. He moved--they moved to Seattle and then he became mayor of Seattle. And we--well when, when I became mayor, they got in touch with me and I went back. I think all three of us made speeches that day because the school was celebrating a hundred years. And my parents [Jessie Martin Morrison and Elmer Morrison II] had gone to the same school, Manual High School [Manual Training High School]. As a matter of fact, I was just there recently--because I'm on some--I'm a legacy or something for--so they just put all our pictures up at, at Manual. But it was just a close--Wellington's wife [HistoryMaker Wilma J. Webb] tells me that she remembers, she says, "I always wanted to be like you when I grew up because you were just always so friendly and you're always help--." 'Cause she was in a lower class and I used, I used to go there and read stories to--you know 'cause you think you're big even though you're like ninth grade (laughter). But you wanna go and, and help the younger children. And, and the citizens made it possible, you know, for you to do that. Your, your church groups were--they would reach out and suggest that you do things and involve you.
Story_ID: 618122
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now you talked about two things. One, about the mayors and, and Benjamin Stapleton [Benjamin F. Stapleton] was the mayor, was he the mayor during your time?
Speaker 2: Wellington.
Speaker 1: Wellington.
Speaker 2: [HistoryMaker] Wellington Webb.
Speaker 1: Okay, well okay when you were talking about--when you said Wellington's wife [HistoryMaker Wilma J. Webb], you meant Wellington Webb.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I'm, I'm talking about when you were growing up, do you remember the Mayor Stapleton?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah. I mean you know I, I didn't know him--I can't even think, golly. There was some--I'm sorry, I just cannot remember. But I always went to city hall [Denver City and County Building, Denver, Colorado] and to the museum [Denver Art Museum, Denver, Colorado]--the, the complex [Civic Center] was downtown in Denver [Colorado]. So you could go to the museum, the library [Central Library, Denver, Colorado], city hall, everything was just kind of like right there. And so I used--and I could ride the bus there. So I would just get lost in the halls of going and watching and looking at the museum and seeing things that were going on.
Speaker 1: So at that time, blacks and, and whites could just--could go and, and utilize the library and the museums (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes. And I, you know I keep wondering because when I come here and I hear about, you know, the integration and the segregation and all, and I don't remember it in Denver. Although my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] remembers. I--she reminds me of an incident I can remember being at a--what's that, Kress [S.H. Kress Company], a Kress, or maybe Woolworth [F.W. Woolworth Company], one of 'em. And we were at a lunch counter. And we were just going to get our lunch. And there was a long line, so we were waiting for seats to be vacated to get in. So we're standing there and this elderly white lady came up and just pushed me out of the way. And boy, my mother--I never saw her react, and just kind of move that lady aside and made me sit down. And she said to me that respect is due where it's earned, and that she--the lady--we had been standing there. And any other time, she would respect her age. But the way she did it, you know. And so, so there were things like that, but I never--my brother [Elmer Morrison III] and I used to go to theaters. And we'd go and sit right downstairs. Well mom and dad [Elmer Morrison II] remember that they had to go upstairs. But I guess during my time, either no one would say it to us or we didn't know. And so we never--I never remembered. The only--that's the only time I remembered something like that was, you know, at this particular lunch counter. I don't remember any overt things. But you know how sometimes when you're--when they're few, you know and a--people always spent time saying you're different, you know. What do you mean different? You know. Of course I, I--that's the same thing that you hear now I guess because you can talk, that you're different than Joe Blow who is sitting on the curb.
Story_ID: 618123
Speaker 1: Also before we get too far away from--you had made a statement about you remembered when Roosevelt [President Franklin Delano Roosevelt] died.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And it was that and, and tell me about that, what you remember about that.
Speaker 2: Well I just remember, you know because we--I used to pay a lot of attention--listen to the radio all the time. And you know there was a certain time that everybody went and sat down at the radio in the evening I think. Maybe after dinner, or during dinner or something. I remember Gabriel Heatter, he was my favorite newscaster. And he would--I mean he just had such a interesting voice and he would just bring you up to date on things that were going on. And that was the feeling I had about Roosevelt. I just felt like he really cared about us and he was just--it was just kind of like being in your living room talking to you. And then my friend and I, you know we'd talk about what he said or what he was gonna do. And of course his wife [Eleanor Roosevelt], she was something. And we're saying, you know, isn't that something that she's doing all of these things and he allows her do it. You know and I don't think she even ask, she just does it, she knows there's things that need to be done. And of course as I grew older, I learned to appreciate her, you know, even more, for her--the contact she had with the lady in Florida. The school [Bethune-Cookman College; Bethune-Cookman University, Daytona Beach, Florida]. I can just see her, but anyway. Oh my goodness.
Speaker 1: Bethune [Mary McLeod Bethune]?
Speaker 2: Bethune, right, right, right. Yeah. So I mean she--but yeah, that was, that was a really--and I guess you know at that age, you're just realizing when people pass, that they're passed, you know, that they're gone. And I think that's what really touched us. Like golly, what's gonna happen now? And what about the war [World War II, WWII] and what, you know, I mean those were kinds of things that we, Carol [Carol Hagahara (ph.)] and I talked about. But you know my other girlfriends, Winnie [ph.] who is a real good friend now, still. We would--she lived near the high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado]. So I would walk to her house and then change clothes at her house on something that I wanted to wear at school (laughter). And usually it was something of my mother's [Jessie Martin Morrison]. And we laughed about that the other day. We'd all go in there and change clothes and then go to school. Then I'd have to go back by and get my clothes and go home before my mother got home. And she could tell because she says you never separate a suit, you know, if you, you don't wanna clean part of it and not the other. And she could kind of tell as she looked at her things that, "Somebody's been wearing my clothes."
Story_ID: 618124
Speaker 1: Let's talk about high school and what school did you go to?
Speaker 2: Manual High School [Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And before that, it was called Manual Training High School. So during my time, they took the training off of it and it was just Manual High School. And that my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] and father [Elmer Morrison II] and aunts all went to the same high school.
Speaker 1: Right. Now before they took the training off of it, I understand that they had vocational training rather than college preparatory. Did that change when you were there (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) That changed, that changed. Just probably just before I got there. 'Cause, as a matter of fact, I think it changed 'cause my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] was three years older. And I think it changed maybe a year or so after he got there. Yeah, but daddy said, see they had different proms and they had their prom at one place, the other kids would have it someplace. So it was really segregated. Yeah it was really segregated at that time. But see it, it changed because I talked to you about the mayors being from the same high school. Wellington [HistoryMaker Wellington Webb] and Norm [HistoryMaker Norman Rice], because they, they, they stayed in touch with one of our teachers. First we all said, "Which teacher really impressed you? Which one did you like?" So we all came up, and you know we had two or three different ones, but we all came up with this one teacher; Ms. Lindeman [ph.]. And she was just wonderful. She was white. She didn't live in our community, but we knew she loved us. And you know a long time ago in--for church, you had to learn parts for Easter and Christmas, you know how you'd give your little thing. And she would help me with it, you know or she'd say, "Okay, Pat [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard], let's hear it. What are you gonna--," you know. And then on Monday she'd say, "How'd it go?" So you knew she really did care, she really cared. And she used to always say, "You've got to write a theme. If you can't write these themes, you're not gonna be able to get in college." So that's all I heard, writing themes. Then she talked about how, "They want me to--the office, they want me to change schools. They want me to go and I said, 'I am not gonna leave my babies.' I'm gonna--." And at first I didn't understand that. But now, she didn't want to go to another school. She wanted to stay there where she could do the most good. But see even now your really good teachers then will be put in another situation where they're not needed that much. You know what I mean? And she knew that she wanted to stay where she could make a big impact. And we really appreciated her for--and Wellington actually visited her in the nursing home before she passed away. And I think that's what--I mean they--you just--it was just so different. You just felt the teachers cared about you.
Speaker 1: Just to go back a little bit. When the schools were segre- you said it was very segregated, but whites and blacks went to the same school, they just had different trainings. Blacks had vocational training, and the whites had college preparatory, is that what you're saying (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Probably pretty much. I mean it wasn't--see it's just--we had the--we had a college track, but then we also had an opportunity to take home ec [home economics] for sewing, cooking, and things like that. So yeah, it was just a broad curriculum. They prilly- really ought to have that now.
Story_ID: 618125
Speaker 1: So tell me more about what you participated in, in high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado].
Speaker 2: Well, I was in the pep club and I was a cheerleader, and I can think about being--'cause like you know, daddy [Elmer Morrison II], they go to the games usually to watch your sons play football. But they would go watch me cheer. And I remember the first game, we had it at the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado]. I don't know why we had it there, but in that stadium. And I'm there saying, "Push 'em back, push 'em back." And my father said, "Pat [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard], it's this way, not this way." I was saying push 'em back the wrong way (laughter). So that was kind of funny. I was glad he was there 'cause I didn't really know the game that well. But all the cheerleaders were following me (laughter). But I did--I was cheerleader, pep club and I didn't sing, but I was in this all-city group of officers where I met Marilyn Van Derbur. Remember--well you don't remember, but she was Miss America in--it must have been in the '60s [sic. 1958], or the--would it be the '60s [1960s]? Anyway, she was--I, I was here, I was in the state, so it had to be maybe the early '60s [1960s]. But anyway, she was happened to be in our group 'cause she was in East High School [Denver, Colorado]. And you know we had representatives from all the high schools for students, it was like student government. And I remembered her and was happy to see that she became Miss America. Her father [Francis S. Van Derbur] had Olinger Mortuaries [Olinger Mortuaries, Inc.]. And of course that's where you know that it's about money, you know in those situations. People who can afford to, you know, be in that kind of competition. And that's probably still true. But yeah there were a lot of great people. My person who sang in my wedding is still living in Denver [Colorado], Joyce [ph.]. And it's, it's hard now to go back because I don't remember--see if I had been there watching them as we grow older, I would know. But because I'm--wasn't home that often, now I see 'em and I'm, I'm not sure until they say something, you know. If they say something, then I'll remember. Now they know me because of course I'm coming in, you know. But--
Speaker 1: Tell me about how involved you were with student government in high school.
Speaker 2: Very (laughter). I was very, very involved with student government, student council and that's when I first heard about the United Negro College Fund [UNCF]. And I don't know, it must have been one of the teachers or something and they had all these forms to get people to donate. And I remember going around and most of the people had never heard of it. That was my recollection, you know. "What, what is this?" And that was kind of difficult. It might have been maybe around the first time--'cause that was before I was married [to HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] I know when I was helping out. But you know you had Red Cross [American Red Cross], we had Red Cross in the school. And so anything--Community Chest. Anything like that, helping others, I was there. I sold can- I sold Bauer's [Bauer's Candies] crystal cuts for--I thought I never wanna see another piece of candy, 'cause that's what we did, the Camp Fire Girls [Camp Fire Girls of America; Camp Fire] instead of cookies, we sold candy. And I used to always win 'cause my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] was the leader, and so I had to sell more than anybody else, you know.
Speaker 1: How, how long did you stay in the Camp Fire Girls?
Speaker 2: Throughout high school. 'Cause it was Camp Fire Girls and then Horizon Club girls were the seniors. And so I went through high school.
Speaker 1: And now did your academics get better in high school?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think so (laughter). I recognized the necessity for doing that, you know, because if you wanna go further, you certainly have to have a good record.
Story_ID: 618126
Speaker 1: What did you think you would become? What did you wanna be after high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado], or after you went to college?
Speaker 2: Well, you know what? I wanna, I really wanted to be a special agent of the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation]. Isn't that--I wanted to be a special agent of the FBI. And I got some kind of twenty-five dollar savings bond for something that I tried out for. And I, and I would all--I was always fascinated by detectives. You know like if you go to the supermarket, or the, the department store. And I remember I could always pick the people there who were watching you. And I would go test them. You know I'd run around the store and go and look and peek and find out who they were (laughter). I was so crazy. So when I started school, I signed up for the, the--cannot think of the school, it's in California. And I made arrangements to go for an interview and my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] agreed with me, 'cause we were driving to L.A. [Los Angeles, California]. So she said, so we'll, we'll stop by there on the way, but I hadn't told my father [Elmer Morrison II]. But anyway, I got very discouraged. I, I need to find the name of that school because they said there are no women and I was too short, and I needed to be an attorney. You know they had all these different reasons about why I couldn't do it. I'd just graduated from high school. And it was very disappointing to me because that's what I thought I wanted to do. But then of course I was interested in teaching. But after marrying my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] and he was such an expert teacher that I just kind of changed my mind about teaching (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay. So besides that one teacher in high school, were there any other teachers that helped you or encouraged you?
Speaker 2: Right, yeah, Mrs. Nelson [ph.] and there was many, many, you know who just seemed to have time to do it, which I, I don't--of course I think because we, we moved in the same circles. You know they were in the neighborhood. You'd see 'em at the grocery store. They'd have us doing things for them, you know, or--so it was, it was not--we were in--they were not on the other side of town. I find it difficult now for young people to know their teachers. But we, we were just all in the same community, so it was good for you to pattern your life after somebody who went to your church, who sang in the choir. Who--and so those were usually the people that I really cared about. So they were active with their sororities and usually sororities were the ones helping students with their lessons, with studying for exams, getting ready for college, it was the same teachers. And you saw them right in the community. And so that had a lot to do with what you did later in life because you remember Miss Nelson was a, was a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.] like [HistoryMaker] Dorothy Height. See I remember her coming to Denver [Colorado] with one of the Jabberwock, one of the programs that the Deltas had and I--golly, she was just such a phenomenal woman. And then just look. I mean she just did such great things. And so these were the people that I was exposed to from my mother. I mean I never would have known, but she always sat me down and explained to me what people were doing and you have lots of choices. You know there was a long time ago when you could do--there were certain things you did, but you know, you can do whatever you wanna do.
Speaker 1: So you graduate in 1955?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And so what do you do now that you're disappointed that you couldn't get into that school in California?
Speaker 2: Well I just--what did I do? Which school?
Speaker 1: After you graduated from high school.
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean, oh the [U.S.] military--I went to--you mean the--I'm sorry (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The FBI school.
Speaker 2: Oh yes, I went to California State [Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], yeah. And my [maternal] grandparents [Ida Martin and Jesse Martin] lived there, so that made it, you know, that was nice. And I was, was dating my husband, except that he went to the military. He went to the service. And so he was saying you know, "We really should get married." And my mother said, "You'd just be a glorified housekeeper" (laughter). She said, "I don't think you should do that, you know, you need to do what you're gonna do first. And then if it still works out, you know that's fine." So and I was, I was happy with it.
Story_ID: 618127
Speaker 1: Now you and Asa [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] had known each other, but you didn't date because he was older than you and when you're teenagers, it seems like you know, if he's fifteen you're only twelve or something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: So when did you decide that you would become more than just friends?
Speaker 2: Probably when I graduated from high school [Manual High School, Denver, Colorado] and he graduated from college [University of Denver, Denver, Colorado] that same year, but maybe a year before that. I remember his--see he had a sister who was my age. And I remember one time she had a party at her house and he came home to--came to the party. And that's when I kind of--I mean I kind of knew of him, but that's when I kind of met him. And I guess he kind of noticed me and I noticed him (laughter). And then every now and then I would see him. I remember--was it when I was in high school, at the church they used to have a church, a church social at the Presbyterian church. And I remember seeing him there one time and so he asked if I would come with him the next week. And I said, "Well, you know call me and let me know." So you know like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, he never called. So my friend who was gonna date his friend, he had called her and had the date already. She said, "Well Pat [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard], well Al [ph.] called me." I said, "Well Asa hasn't called me yet." So what I did is I made a date with another guy who was also went to the church. And so, so Asa never did call me. But the day of the--the evening of the party, he had his friend call to say that, "I'm supposed to pick you up. Asa asked if I could please pick you up and he'll meet you there because he had to do a speech or something." And, and I said, "Well I'm sorry, but I already have a date." So he says--he was so shocked by it, see so when I got there, I, you know I, I was there. Then Asa came in. He didn't know. He didn't have, he didn't know, that was before the phones. He didn't know that I wasn't there for him. And he was kind of shocked (laughter), you know, 'cause I guess his friend was trying to get him before he got to me to say she's not with you, you know. And to me when I think about it now, you know I kind of laugh, laugh about it. But that was probably a good lesson because he was probably just so sure (background noise) that I was waiting.
Story_ID: 618128
Speaker 1: --To California State [Los Angeles State College of Applied Arts and Sciences; California State University, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], and how long did you stay there?
Speaker 2: A year.
Speaker 1: A year. And did you work while you were in California?
Speaker 2: Yes, I worked at the--for the California public schools as a playground director in Watts [Los Angeles, California]. That was interesting (laughter). And I'd ride the streetcar there. But you know I think it's just all the way that you respect people. You know, if you go there with preconceived notions, then you're gonna be treated that way. But I always, I never had a problem. You know if anything, I--they helped me, you know because if you go in and you're honest and say I don't really live here and I don't know the neighborhood, and you have to help me. And how do I get, you know--and then they're always asking me, what can I do or how can I help you? So I mean and I just, I guess I just lived my whole life like that, without going in--respecting people first, you know.
Speaker 1: So you stayed there for a year and then you went back to Denver [Colorado]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What made you leave California before finishing school?
Speaker 2: Well because Asa [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] was coming home from the [U.S. military] service. And he was pushing me, you know, to marry. And so I said okay. So in '57 [1957] is when, when we married, in November of '57 [1957]. And then after we married, I went back to school at Colorado State College of Education [Colorado State College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado]. And then we started having children, so I didn't get my degree until San Francisco State [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California].
Speaker 1: And what were you majoring in?
Speaker 2: What was I--I guess I said elementary education. But I, you know I was just kind of dabbling, which is why I ended up getting a degree in interdisciplinary social sciences. Because at one point I thought I'd look and see what acting was about (laughter). And I remember taking this pantomime, pantomime class. And that didn't work because you know if you go in one door, you've got to come out that same door. You know when you're--you go in and you walk in the door, and then after you do whatever you're gonna do, you have to come back to the same door. I couldn't quite get that together (laughter). But I do know some people in that class who, who are doing really very well. And you don't have to look good. You know you just have to be a good actor. And that I wasn't (laughter).
Story_ID: 618129
Speaker 1: So now back in Denver [Colorado]. You didn't have--did you have children immediately, or did you get to work (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In '59 [1959], in '59 [1959].
Speaker 1: Okay, so you married in '57 [1957]. So in '58 [1958] through '61 [1961]--
Speaker 2: Fifty-nine [1959]. I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: But I'm, I'm just asking what did you do? Did you work?
Speaker 2: Well I worked, when I came back to Denver, I worked again for the public schools [Denver Public Schools].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And then I--that's when I kind of began to dabble in politics because I was in--at that time they had precinct committeewomen and a committee captain of parties. And so they--the man who was the cap- the chairman of the precinct of the Democratic Party, asked me if I wanted to be the precinct committeewoman. And so I wasn't sure what that meant. But he, but you know that was the time that they would pass out information for you to understand what you're voting for. See a long time ago, we used to get all of that free and you could read up on it. And so I thought well you know maybe that's something that I can do. So I did that while going to school [Colorado State College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado]. But what he did, he, he told me to come to a meeting at seven o'clock. He said the caucus meeting is at seven o'clock. I got to his house. And when I walked in, there were a few people there and they all looked at their watches, said, "Okay, let's synchronize our watches." Everyone said okay, at seven. So they started the meeting. And as soon as they opened the meeting, the other precinct committeewoman came in with her group of people. And that's when I just felt so terrible because I, you know apparently it was all planned. They didn't want that lady anymore. And so they used me. So I realized what happened. I mean I didn't really know her because we had--we had moved in our house when we married, we moved right away into our own house. So I went to a meeting, what was it--they had a district meeting. And he could not--Mr. Broadnax [ph.], he could not attend and asked me to go to the district meeting. So when I got there, I found out how it worked, you know, that when they get all this--the brochure and stuff, they give it to the district captain. And then he gives it to people to pass it out, and they give him money to do that. Well see, I had been doing it and getting my friend, and she and I would do it and, and for no money. I mean we weren't expecting money. I didn't know there was any money. So when I heard this, I thought hm, so I got my friend and he gave me the money. And I got all the brochures, and we distributed it. So then the captain calls me, you know, a couple, three days later and wants to know, "Do you have, you know, information?" I said, "No, it's already been distributed." So he was really very surprised, see, because he was giving it to young people. And what they were doing is just getting rid of it. They were not doing it door to door as we were doing it. See we'd actually ring the doorbell and explain what was going on. So I was so happy that I was able to pay her for what she'd been doing with me for nothing. So then about that time we became dorm parents at the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado]. My husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] was working on his doctorate, so we had to move from our house to campus. But I was still the precinct committeewoman. And I can't remember what the issue was, but he got so angry with me, the captain, and called my father [Elmer Morrison II] because see he was a friend of my father. And he said that, "She can't continue to do this because it's against the law and she doesn't even live there," and, and he was--and I got laryngitis. I couldn't talk to him. You see I had no voice. And--but we found out that in fact I was still a registered Democrat and I was there on campus temporarily. And so that I was allowed to do it. But anyway, that was the beginning of my (laughter), my politics. And I would go to the meetings and one thing I think I did wrong, if the caucus wanted to do something and I didn't agree, I didn't vote with the caucus. I mean you know I didn't understand--and I remember one meeting my husband went. He said, "Well Pat [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard], why are you--nobody else is standing up." But anyway I said, "But this is the way I feel." I mean--so anyway something might have happened had I stayed in Denver, (laughter) I don't know. But that's really--I really got the feel, I got the bug I think for politics when I was, when I was really started, you know, in Denver trying to convince people to, to read up on information.

Speaker 1: We said that you got married to Asa Hilliard [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III]. Just give us a little about who Asa Hilliard became.
Speaker 2: He--you mean--
Speaker 1: Tell me about Asa (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) He was a teacher, a teacher, a teacher of teachers. And a real intense person. His feeling is that all children can learn. And you just have to have the will to teach 'em. So he went about with his research to find ways to enhance the teaching of people who were gonna be teaching our kids. And that's what he devoted his life to. I used to think that he had a mission and, and in fact he did have a mission, you know, and it was just like he was always rushed to get certain things done. And when certain information would come up, if somebody said something that was derogatory about African Americans or something. And I'd say, "Well why don't you write the paper, why don't you--." He said, "Pat [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard], I can't do that. I can't do the research and that also. Somebody else has to do that. I have to do--continue the research." And so he never said anything that was just off the cuff, you know, I mean he did--I mean if I, I'd listen to--I would really probably be taking more notes than anybody else as I went to sessions because then I was--became involved in education and school board and I needed information that he was giving so that I could take back to my board. So I'm sitting there taking as many notes as other people. And it really helped me define my understanding of, you know, what needed to be. That, that all people can learn. That you just have to care about 'em. Once they know you care about 'em, then they're gonna do their best to, to do for you. But he then became interested in Egyptology because he said, "I know there's gotta be something more than this." I mean we went to Greece and I remember reading the little brochures saying this is this and that and I got so annoyed because Asa was way miles ahead of me, you know and I'm trying to make the kids stay with me and they're--and he said, "I just know this is not it." And of course what we learned in Egypt, we knew that that was before the Parthenon [Athens, Greece], you know. And so as he learned--as he was getting more information, he'd wake up in the middle of the night because something he'd read and he'd say did you know--so for a while I was able to keep up with him, but then he lost, he left me. But see then you can get references from the books and then this one said this and this one. And consequently, he just became a real authority and really wanting to help other people with the information. And I guess that's what I had such--as I talk to people now--'cause I didn't--he used to always say you still don't know what I do, do you? And I did, but now I have even a better understanding, you know as I hear from people and they say how much he helped them, you know, with their understanding and appreciation of who they are and what they ought to be doing, you know, to help our people. I remember them speaking, him speaking at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] once to scholars, saying that you need to be doing your own research on your own people, not research for your professors, which is what used to happen a long time ago. When we got to the level of doing work for our doctorate, it was for the professor and not for us and not for our people. And so he said, "You know you're top scholars, and please do that." So he ended up advising a lot of students, but in most cases they were dealing with professors who had no idea of what they were doing, their research, but Asa did. Which meant that he was traveling, you know, all over the country helping different people because he could do that, you know, as a professor.
Story_ID: 618131
Speaker 1: When do you have your first child and--well actually tell me all of your children and when they were born.
Speaker 2: Asa IV [Asa Hilliard IV] was born in '59 [1959] on St. Valentine's Day as a matter of fact. And he is no longer living. He passed away. He was a bipolar patient, mental health, and he passed away last year. Then Robi [Robi Hilliard Herron] is--Robi was born in '60 [1960], and they both having the, the same age for a couple, three weeks (laughter). And she didn't like that when she was younger. But when she got older, she didn't want him saying that. Then Trish is--was born in '63 [1963], and I named her Margaret Patricia Elizabeth [Patricia Hilliard Nunn], that's for my, my--both grandmothers and me, she's got all those names. And then Hakim is Michael Hakim Hilliard [M. Hakim Hilliard] and he's the youngest, and he was the one who was born in Liberia. And Robi was named for my husband's favorite uncle, Uncle Robi. So he said it's a boy or a girl, we'll still name her--so she's R-O-B-I.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what happens after you have your first child? Your husband becomes a professor at San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm. Well, let's see, no he was--that's when he was working. He got his master's [degree] and his doctorate at the University of Denver [Denver, Colorado]. And in '63 [1963] is when he got his doctorate and we moved to San Francisco [California]. So Trisha was born, and we drove cross country to San Francisco State in '63 [1963]. And then in '64 [1964] we left for Monrovia, Liberia.
Speaker 1: Is there any stories you wanna talk about in San Francisco for that year?
Speaker 2: Well, I know I could not stand our house (laughter), but it was close to the campus and I remember us stopping in Los Angeles [California] with my [maternal] grandparents [Ida Martin and Jesse Martin]. And so she was giving me this list of things to ask Asa [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] about the house that he was--see he left us there and he drove on to San Francisco to get a house, or someplace for us to live. And so she was saying, "Now make sure it's central heating." She had all these--and so everything I asked him, he said, "Yes, yes, yes," which wasn't true. But he just wanted us you know, there. So we were--I did not like the house (laughter). But it was close; it was right on a hill so you know, with bikes and all, it was impossible for the kids to ride. I'd have to put 'em in the car and take 'em to the park and things. But I guess that made me learn a lot about San Francisco 'cause we do most of our sightseeing in the evening when he got off work. Then we'd drive up and down the hills of San Francisco. And then one day he came home and he said, "Guess what? We're gonna go to Africa." And he had heard about--they were training Peace Corps volunteers at San Francisco State in the teaching, to teach. And so he had applied for that. And so when he got the position, he had to go to D.C. [Washington, D.C.] for an interview. So he took my daughter Trisha, who was like about a year old, and dropped her off in Denver [Colorado] and went on to D.C. He was so worried 'cause, "What if your mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] is late getting to the airport?" But anyway so we decided to go and people were saying, "You're gonna take those children to Africa?" That was the very best experience of my whole life, I think of my whole married life.
Speaker 1: Before we go on to Africa, let me ask you about, about housing. You said when you first got married, you moved right into your house (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Our own home, right.
Speaker 1: Was your husband able to have the V--G.I. Bill [Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944]?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.
Speaker 1: To be able to buy, buy a home?
Speaker 2: Right, right, yes. Just, just--and it was a living room, two bedrooms and a kitchen, just a little house. And of course the bath, great big backyard, and a great big front yard. And I was just telling my children the other day, we used to have a big picnic for holidays. You know we didn't wanna go to the mountains or something like that because of accidents and things. So we started having our friends come over and it was like a potluck. We would furnish the meat, and then they'd bring--and so I've got pictures of us with no children and the people who came no children, until it grew to a lot of children in the yard. We had horseshoes and we'd play games and things in the yard. So we, we enjoyed that house. But then of course we, we rented it. You know, we (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Oh, you did, I was gonna ask you did you rent it or did, did you sell it.
Story_ID: 618132
Speaker 1: Getting prepared to go to Africa. What did you think about that? I mean did you--how did you have to prepare? I mean at that time was there a lot of shots and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had to do our shots and all (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You took all of your children?
Speaker 2: We took all the children. And you know there were several people at the college who had been. And of course their interpretation of it was a lot different than our own. There were no African Americans there. And so the stories I heard, you know were like unbelievable. Like my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] said, "Those people been there all these years, they gotta be using something for toilet paper." 'Cause you know they were telling us to take all the paper goods and Kleenex tissue and he said, "Pat [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard] now you know they're--we are not taking that kind of stuff." And sure enough, it was there. You know we could buy it there. And then they said, "You know you don't have to worry about church on Sunday because nobody really dresses up, you don't have to wear hose." You know we said, "You know, we will do what we always do." And I guess sometimes that's the best way to do instead of listening to the way other people--and I noticed even after going and then coming back and hearing my story and hearing their story was totally different. And see he was chief of party of the San Francisco team, so we would have--we were always having receptions to introduce our people to the Liberian community. And so our people who were already there would say, "Well you know the officials, they're not gonna come. They're not gonna--they don't come." Well that wasn't true because everybody came. You know just because we invited--they, they knew we wanted them to come and then we had made friends. I mean real friends with the Liberians. So when we had a reception, we had everybody except the president [William Tubman]. You know, but we, we were very good--we, we had very good friends in--like the secretary of state [Joseph Rudolph Grimes] lived down the street from us and his daughter and--his niece and my daughter are very good friends now. She's moved here. As a matter of fact, she married in our house when we first moved back to Georgia, she got married. She graduated from Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and they married in our yard here. But we just--you know I think it's, it's just the way you carry yourself, the way you care, care about people. And we never had a problem with people coming for us to introduce them. So had we listened to people who were already there, we probably would not have invited the Liberian officials. But if you're coming, working with the program, you need to know the people that you're working for. And so we invited them and they came.
Speaker 1: You were the first African American family to go to work there with the Peace Corps?
Speaker 2: No, not with Peace Corps, with--see we were contracted to Peace Corps from Peace Corps staff and from Liberia. We were--it was a contract overseas operator or whatever. And so we came from San Francisco State [San Francisco State College; San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California], but contracted to Peace Corps. So we were--he was in charge of elementary and secondary. There were teachers, young people who came to teach who had no teaching experience. You know they hadn't taken none of those teaching courses. So he went to advise them. They were hired as teachers but had never taught. So he helped them in elementary and secondary. And so there were a number of African, well not a lot, but there were a few African Americans. Then see he changed after two years, he directed a project in setting up a model school system. And so we were the--he was the first black to do that from the college. So he was actually from the college, but working for AID, Aid for Independent Development or whatever [sic. United States Agency for International Development].
Speaker 1: Now when he--you said that he came home and said we're going to Africa. So were you as enthusiastic about going to Africa as he was? I mean (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was.
Speaker 1: --was this--so this really wasn't a joint decision, or did he just say we were going and you got excited about it.
Speaker 2: Well, because he said, he said, "Marry me and we'll see the world." And that's exactly what happened. He said, you know I mean so it's kind of an ideal that he had. And so yeah I was ready. I mean my family, "You're gonna take those children?" I said, "Of course." And they had such wonderful experiences that they never would have had here. They had a, a 'Romper Room' program where they were on television all the time. A dance, they took dancing lessons from a lady who was from Britain who taught classes weekly and they had their costumes and they were in show--I mean it was just--they had the YMCA [Young Men's Christian Association]. We met the director of the YMCA and his--matter of fact, one of the direct- they're coming here in about three weeks. He's retired now, but you know you just make--some of my very best friends I met in Liberia and my son's godmother, Judith [ph.], is still in Liberia. You know it's just been wonderful. They had a Tuskegee team [Tuskegee Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] there so the--one of the people in the Tuskegee team is--she and her husband are my son's godparents. So yes, two sets of godparents, American and Liberian. So we just--I mean it was just that Liberian church just on Sunday, it was Men's Day and my youngest son [M. Hakim Hilliard] spoke. And they're always happy to have him around because him having been born there. So my goal now is to get him to Liberia 'cause he's never been (laughter) since his birth.
Story_ID: 618133
Speaker 1: While you're there, you become a part of the American Women in Liberia. What is that that organization does (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) (Laughter) I had to laugh about that. I just did it because they asked me to. But I thought you know why do we need American Women in Liberia? But what happened--I would go to these parties and people would say, "Well, when I was in London [England], we used to do so and so." "When I was in Paris [France], we did so and so." So their whole idea is that there's nothing to do in Liberia. I mean you know there's nothing. These people don't know what they're doing and we can't help out at all. So I thought okay. And that's why I joined the American Women in Liberia 'cause I thought this is what I can add, this whole volunteer thing. So I went to several agencies in Monrovia [Liberia]. And I said, "There's a possibility that you'll get a volunteer," I said, "because you know there are a lot of Americans who are here with their husbands, and they're here for like one or two years. And they're professional. So they wanna do something to enhance their profession, and they want it to be stimulating, and at the same time to help you. So what is it that we can do in your agency that will be helpful to you?" And I wanted to make sure it was their choice because I also found that many of us will go into a situation and say this is what we're going to do whether they want you to do it or not. And I had observed that. So I had lists of things of what agencies wanted us to do. So then I made up the list and I took it back to the organization and so they agreed that we'd circulate this list. So then I was happy to go to cocktail parties and I'd hear that conversation, I'd say, "Well here, it's something right here. Why don't you check on--let me know what you wanna do and I'll get in touch with them." That was really rewarding to me because I didn't have many people complaining about what there was not--what they were not able to do in Liberia. 'Cause I think one of the first things I did is work at a hospital. And I was filling mayonnaise jars with St. Joseph baby aspirins. Now you know I mean I'm sure that's necessary, but surely there's something else I can do that, you know and that's kind--so we changed that whole thing, and I think it was really good and many of the people in Liberia were very happy for that.
Speaker 1: Now--how, how many years did you stay in Liberia?
Speaker 2: Six years, just before I came home, I became a member of the Eastern Star [Order of the Eastern Star]. And that was exciting because I--well I, yeah I was able to go to--they have a temple there. I was in the Queen Esther Chapter [Queen Esther Chapter No. 1] of Eastern Star, and so the temple in Liberia we actually met in. And I think it's been destroyed now you know because of the war [Liberian Civil War]. But it just happened that Mrs. Tubman [Antoinette Tubman] was in our same chapter. And so I had a couple of opportunities to actually go to the mansion and speak with her personally, and that was just a thrill. I tell you it was a thrill of a lifetime.
Speaker 1: Tell me who Mrs. Tubman is.
Speaker 2: She was the wife of President W.V.S. Tubman [William Tubman], who was the president of the country when we got there. He passed away I think in 1970, either '70 [1970] or '71 [1971], but he had been president for some time. And you know they often talk about, you know, how African government should be. But it was in a sen- it was not a totalitarian government, but he had a way with his paramount chiefs. If there was a dispute, he would get together with all the chiefs and they'd settle it. Now how, how they did it, they did it. But it may not be our way, but it was their way. And we need to be respectful of the way other people do things and not insist that they do it our way 'cause it doesn't always work. And I think we're learning that now with some of the confrontations that we're in presently. But it was, it was--I went back for the inauguration two or three years ago with the first president [first female president], Ellen [Ellen Johnson Sirleaf], and that was exciting because I remember President Sirleaf used to come to our house a lot and say what should be happening in Liberia. And she and my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] would have these long conversations. So when I got a chance to see her when I went back for the inauguration, I said, "Okay, remember all those things that you said? Okay it's your turn to do it." 'Course it's, you know, certainly not that easy and it's difficult as a woman to do things. And she's had to really kind of make some changes in the government. And I think they're having a hard time accepting a female. But I just love that country. We're--I'm an honorary Liberian.
Story_ID: 618134
Speaker 1: You also helped establish a Delta sorority chapter there (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 1: Tell me, tell me the name of it and when was that.
Speaker 2: Right. It was the Liberian chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc.]. And that had to be in 1968, either '67 [1967] or '68 [1968]. And I think we took in about six members and three of them were Liberian. And I mean that was very exciting, you know it's such a distance to do that. And so we were always on the telephone with our chapter here. But they're still--we were just anxious to get some Liberians to be members of our sorority, so that was, that was thrilling.
Speaker 1: So just to go back to, to fill in, when did you pledge and had you graduated from San Francisco, was it San Francisco State [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California]? Or what school did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I--no, I was still in school [at Colorado State College; University of Northern Colorado, Greeley, Colorado]. It was in '59 [1959] when I was in school, '59 [1959]. I pledged in Denver [Colorado] when I was pregnant with my first child [Asa Hilliard IV]. And I pledged a Denver mixed chapter. You know how sometimes they have the undergraduate chapters? Well they didn't have that in Denver. It was the Beta Phi Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority in Denver, and that was in '59 [1959]. And I just celebrated fifty years last year. I can't believe that. And my daughter Trisha [Patricia Hilliard Nunn] is a Delta. And she finished Hampton [Hampton Institute; Hampton University, Hampton, Virginia]. And my granddaughter, Maia [Maia Watkins] who finished Rensselaer [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York] is a Delta. And then of course my mother-in-law [Lois O. Williams] was a Delta and my--her daughter Gale [Gale Hilliard Goodwill] was a Delta. So we've got a big Delta family.
Speaker 1: And, and tell me what year you graduated from college.
Speaker 2: You know I can't remember, is it seventy--it's the same year that my son graduated from high school. So it's about '78 [1978], '77 [1977]. I can't remember (laughter) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Okay we'll figure it out, okay that's fine. Okay so when your time is up, your six years, did you have a contract for that amount of time and then you came back to the states?
Speaker 2: Oh yes. Yeah he did Peace Corps staff for two years and then he transferred over to setting up a model school system. And that was a ten year project. But he did four years. And then he was--we went back at the ten years to--for the celebration. That's when it became operational for the Liberians. You see the project--the, the Americans went in to free up the teachers, the Liberian teachers, to get additional education, like in math and science and all. So either they came to the states or they went to Europe. So after the ten years, they came back and they were in charge. And that was interesting to see, but it was also interesting to watch the Americans 'cause you know it's hard for us to give up. I mean when we're in charge, we wanna keep doing it. But it was, you know it was really kind of good to see them become operational. And my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] got a decoration for his service from the president.
Story_ID: 618135
Speaker 1: So, in 1970 you leave [Monrovia, Liberia] and what do you do between '70 [1970] and '75 [1975]?
Speaker 2: Well, see that's when I ran for the school board [South San Francisco Unified School District] and I was finished taking my teaching credential, getting my teaching credential. I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: So you went back to San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: Yes, we went back. When we left, we went back to San Francisco. And then I went to San Francisco State [San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California]. I majored in interdisciplinary social science. And had to do you know the regular teaching courses. And it was difficult because I became a member of the school board. And it was hard being a teacher and on the school--learning to be a teacher and being on the school board at the same time. But it was great, I was the first female black school board member. And I was asked to serve by the teacher leadership. And I guess because when I--when I got back, I wanted to be involved in schools with the children because in Liberia, I didn't have that opportunity. They were in school, but many of the Americans who were there didn't wanna be bothered with PTA [Parent Teacher Association]. They were so happy to be away from it. And for two years they said you know, "We just do not want to have to do that." So I missed out on that, you know, because there was no organized group. So when I came back, I thought boy I'm gonna be a P- like my mother [Jessie Martin Morrison] was. And I got a little frustrated because I guess I wanted to do more than serve punch and cookies. And that was a time that the government had required that schools have a lot of government programs that involved parents. And I found that it's kind of rubber stamp committees, you know they wanted to make sure that a parent was on a committee to say we're gonna do this or do that and you really had no choice. They just signed your name. And I thought unh-uh, that's not for me. So I guess there were people who recognized my involvement and said you know you really need to run for school board. And I didn't even really know what that meant, 'cause not--you know. So I decided to do it, but my manager worked for the mayor of San Francisco [Joseph Alioto]. See South San Francisco [California] was to San Francisco as East Point [Georgia] is to Atlanta [Georgia]. I mean its borders were contiguous, very close. So he of course commuted each day. So he said, "I'll be your campaign manager, Pat [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard]." And he met with us and he said, "Now everything has to come through me. So any of the other people who were involved, they cannot do it unless they check with me." So it became a very interesting campaign. And I won. They didn't want me to use my--they didn't want people to know I was a woman. So it was just Pat Hilliard. And they didn't want me to have literature that had my picture. So I didn't have literature. And most of the people in South San Francisco were Italian and Greek. And I remember in campaigning, you'd go to some houses and there were seven and eight families, you know in a house. I mean they were really big houses and all the family--I mean I thought that was great. You know all the family living together. And so I won. And so when I ran the next time, I--'course I used pictures (laughter) and a picture of my family and, and I was still Pat. But when I came here, I had to change--see because when you put Pat on something, people assume you're Patricia. And so that's why I really had to take my real name, which is Patsy Jo, because I'm not Patricia and I was--I started out signing Pat Hilliard. And then I had to change it to Patricia, yeah. But yeah I enjoyed that leadership in South San Francisco there.
Speaker 1: Do you remember who you ran against the very first time?
Speaker 2: There--I know it was a man. I remember it was a man because he had cards that he passed out months before the election, which is a good name identification. He had never run before, the seat was open. So somebody, I don't know why, but it was an open seat. So I wasn't running against an incumbent. And, and it was a March election. I remember this distinctly because my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] kept saying, "Pat, stop bothering these people at Christmas. People wanna enjoy Christmas." See I was trying to get my team all together because March, I mean Christmas is, you know, very close to March. And I, you know he said, "No, don't do that now. Wait until you get closer to the time," so--
Speaker 1: So you ran and, and you did two terms?
Speaker 2: Uh-huh. Actually, one term and then I was reelected and then we moved to Georgia about three, four months later.
Story_ID: 618136
Speaker 1: Well, let me ask you about--you also joined the, The Links [The Links, Incorporated] out in San Francisco [California]?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And, and what brought you to that organization?
Speaker 2: Well, my mother-in-law [Lois O. Williams] was a member. My friend was a member and I, I guess I just always kind of admired the kinds of things that they did in, in helping the community, reaching out to the community. So I enjoyed that involvement there because I--when I moved to Atlanta [Georgia], I was able to incorporate some of the things that we did. Although it was interesting to me because we did a lot of Community Chest kind of things there. And here I found some of our membership, especially the older members, did most of their things in our community. You know, they did most of the things around Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] and Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]. And they really did not reach out into the broader community. And so of course they do now. But when I moved here, I remember there was one organization that we were going to work with and a couple of our members really were fearful at going to that particular building because they didn't--they, they, they didn't trust, you know, want for people to know where they lived for fear they may come to their house later. You know how just negative kinds of connotations about things like that.
Speaker 1: Did you keep your Eastern Star [Order of the Eastern Star] membership when you moved back to the states?
Speaker 2: I, I joined again when I came back. I was taken into this chapter, so yes, I was taken into the Ruth Chapter [Ruth Chapter No. 102] here in Atlanta.
Story_ID: 618137
Speaker 1: And now what brings you to Atlanta [Georgia] from San Francisco [California]? By this time now you have gotten your teaching credentials. Are you--and I believe this is 1976.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Uh-huh.
Speaker 1: What--are you going to decide to teach at any time after this?
Speaker 2: Well, there's one thing in just kind of getting organized and you know with the family. The kids were all in the--my son [Asa Hilliard IV] was in college and my daughter [Robi Hilliard Herron] was in college. So we had the two younger ones [Patricia Hilliard Nunn and M. Hakim Hilliard] here 'cause I remember when my younger daughter, she said, "Well mom, will you just let me know, can I try out for cheerleader or not?" And so I had to find out if we were gonna go for sure or not. I started to say, "Trish [Patricia Hilliard Nunn], no you can't try out for cheerleader 'cause we are moving to Georgia." And so we came and I, I have to laugh at the--my two younger children because they were really concerned about me because they knew I was always busy doing things. And they would set up appointments with me. There was a lady who lived across the street who was a singer. And she had rehearsal at her home. So they knew the daughter. So they had called me one day and said, "Mom, we want you to go over to Ella Woods 'cause she's gonna be rehearsing and she said it's fine if you go over. And you can sit there with her." And so that kind of made me feel good 'cause they, they were not used to me just sitting around. Then there's another lady that I know now, who my daughter met her son. And she said, "Mom, Miss Douglas [ph.] sounds exactly like you, and she has a daycare center and she was just telling me--," and so I have her phone number, and it's the same number that she has now. So you know it's funny. You never know what children are feeling. And of course, see my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] was of course very busy because he was just getting organized at, at Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia]. And so that kind of gave me time. So then I met Joe Heckstall who was running for--no he wanted to--he had run twice before I think for city council [East Point City Council]. And so he had heard that we were looking for a house. Well by the time I met him, we already had our house. But he said that--so I said, "Well if you ever decide to run again, let me know, and I'll be your campaign manager." Well guess what? He decided almost immediately. So he ran and I was his campaign manager. Well in the meantime, I was working at the museum, at the, the de Young museum here 'cause I was working at the--I mean at the High Museum [High Museum of Art] here in Atlanta, volunteering. And so I was beginning to do things and meet people in Atlanta. But when he said that he wanted to run, I said, "Okay well you need a headquarters." So we started trying to find a place that would let him set up a headquarters. Well of course no one would. One man--it was in a shopping mall. He said, "Well sure he can have his office here, but he just can't put up any signs." I said, "Well that'll defeat the purpose." And I've had a chance to remind that man of that too. But anyway, we got a construction trailer and Joe had a friend who let him park the trailer in the parking lot at a gas station to use his electricity. And we decorated this trailer. It was sitting up on bricks. And we put all the signs, we had air conditioning and everything, and that's where we ran--that was the headquarters. And Joe was successful. And we got--no one had ever done this before, no one had had a headquarters. And the people running, we never even had signs in our neighborhood. You know so, I mean it was just totally different, the whole campaign was different. And we involved everybody. So he won. So when he won, he appointed me to the Planning and Zoning Commission. And so then that way see I began to meet other people and become involved in the community. And then one thing led to another and for three or four terms. Three terms at least I think I was his campaign manager. So then I said, "You need to be--you need to run for mayor now." And he was a procrastinator and I said, "Joe now is the time, and I'm on my way out of town. And when I come back, we're going to have the meeting," and I set the meeting up at my house. And when I came back, they turned the tables on me. We were just talking about that the other day 'cause he always talks about divine intervention. And he said, "No, I did not wanna be mayor, but I knew you should be." And that was the last thing I, I'd never, ever thought about being mayor. And I remember asking my husband, he says, "No, you don't wanna do that." And then we met, you know, and all the people were here. And they apparently had already talked about it. So that's how I became mayor (laughter). It was nothing that I said when I grow up, I wanna be mayor. So but I--it's just been--I mean it wasn't just me, it was people have just been so wonderful and so helpful. I certainly didn't do it by myself, but I was surprised that all the people I knew and all the things that I had done, which was preparing me, you know, to do it.
Story_ID: 618138
Speaker 1: Talk to me about your campaign. Now who was your campaign manager?
Speaker 2: My campaign manager was my daughter. And she did (laughter)--she was great. Robi [Robi Hilliard Herron] was my campaign manager. And goodness, I had the, you know, people from the museum who helped, my museum friends. They always tease me about calling them that, but we had--I mean we had a great campaign because the young man who helped me in South San Francisco [California] moved here, Richard Smiley. He's from Selma [Alabama] originally. And he was in school at San Mateo college [College of San Mateo] in, in San Mateo [California], when my friend there who taught said, "I'm gonna have Richard come over and help you because he's very good at this political thing." So he did. Well then guess what? He moved here around the time I was running for mayor. So he was here also to help. And just people just--it was a grassroots campaign. So everybody helped, every, every, everybody. I mean people were just you know, very involved.
Speaker 1: Your, your friends at the mu- you call 'em your friends at the museum. They were helpful as well.
Speaker 2: They were very helpful.
Speaker 1: You were one of the few black women who were working at the High Museum [High Museum of Art, Atlanta, Georgia] at that time.
Speaker 2: Right, right, that's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: So your other white friends really helped you in the campaign.
Speaker 2: They did, they did. As I tell you, you know, they're the ones we're still in touch with now. But yeah they came. As a matter of fact, one of them came out the second time I ran, she came and she says, "Now where is your paper? Where is your--," she, she got me set up, you know, again. "Okay, now we're gonna start, we've gotta have this, this and this," and I mean just--and just with the money. I mean she just said, "Okay we've gotta get these envelopes and you've got this and we need to order this," and that was--that's the kind of help, you know, people don't say, "Well what can I do?" But they do. Yeah, so it's--and, and the faith community were just so wonderful. So that's why I decided to do a prayer break- I wanted to do some kind of prayer something with the campaign. But then you know the church and state and separation. So I just decided to have a community prayer breakfast. And that turned out so well that I did it every year. I had--every year ten, every year. I did it for ten years. A prayer breakfast. And the first couple I had are about--at our senior services center [H.J.C. Bowden Senior Multipurpose Facility, East Point, Georgia]. And then we outgrew it because there was so many people. It's like eight [o'clock] in the morning. And there was only man who worked at the center, so it was my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] who had to go help put up tables and chairs and all. And finally it was just--it got to be too much. So we went to a hotel. And the one time we were having--who is the speaker on television who--the judge. Judge Mathis [HistoryMaker Gregory Mathis]. He was going to be a speaker one year. He came to my office and he was speaking at the high school. And someone else was in there and they said, "Mayor, Judge Mathis would be great to be a speaker for the prayer breakfast." This is like September. And so I said, "Would you?" He said, "Yes, I'd love to." So we started our preparations then. We decided to charge twenty-five dollars. We had never charged that much. We've had it at the big stadium. And do you know he didn't show up? It was so terrible. I cannot watch that show now. He said he was coming, and I said it's not a fundraiser, it's not a fundraiser. I just do this for the community. So he called the night before. I was--I had just gotten home. No, I had passed my office to see how everything was going. They said everything is going great. He should be getting in pretty soon. I came home. I got a--I told you I like ice cream. I got a big bowl of ice cream and I was getting ready to eat it and the phone rang. And it was his assistant saying you know that the judge wasn't gonna be able to come. I thought it was a joke. I said, "I beg your pardon?" So he said something about that he'd hurt his back and the doctor said, ordered bed rest. Now this is the night that he--I mean I was just so--I said, "Okay, sorry, thank you." I got on the phone and I called Reverend--goodness, the Ebenezer [Ebenezer Baptist Church, Atlanta, Georgia], Roberts, Reverend Roberts [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. Joseph L. Roberts]. And I told him, you know, what had happened. So he said, "Well you call Bunny King [HistoryMaker Bernice Albertine King]," the, the young. So he said, "Now sometimes she doesn't answer the phone." He gave me Christine's [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris] number. I called her, she gave me the number, so we kept--so then I thought my goodness. So I called C.T. Vivian [HistoryMaker Reverend Dr. C.T. Vivian]. This was like about eleven o'clock at night. And I called and explained my problem. And he was on long distance. He said, "I'll call you right back." And he called me back and said he would do it. I was so happy. But can you imagine? So he came and he was wonderful. Of course there were people who were disappointed, you know, but--
Speaker 1: Who did you run against your, your first time?
Speaker 2: Goodness, about four people, a council member who had been a council member for twenty some odd years. And another person that was born and raised in East Point [Georgia], and another, there were two former council members and then a--they were all men from East Point. And it was interesting with signs, you know. I would, I would go to the--even if I saw someone else's sign in the yard, I'd still go. And then they'd say, "Don't worry about the sign. I've known him all my life, but I wanna vote for you" (laughter).
Speaker 1: So at this point did you use Patsy Jo [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard] or just Pat?
Speaker 2: Patsy Jo.
Speaker 1: Okay, so they knew you were (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so they knew.
Story_ID: 618139
Speaker 1: And what were some of the things that you accomplished your first term [as mayor of East Point, Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well I feel good about, one thing is the library [East Point Branch, East Point, Georgia]. Because we've always had a library, it sits right behind city hall [East Point City Hall, East Point, Georgia], but it really did not have the kind of books that we needed. And we didn't have like where you can go in and read the newspaper or read Ebony magazine or something. It didn't represent the community as it had changed. And so I found out when I first moved here that the county put a library in every city. There were six, six cities in Fulton County [Georgia]. And the, the--and so but on the headlines of the newspaper it said, "East Point says no to Fulton County library." And I could never understand that. So one of the first things I did is meet with the county manager. We had a meeting at my office. And I said, "What can we do to get a library here?" So we started that process. And you know I had some people who didn't want it--but--and that just shows you how people work together because there was a minister, Reverend Fordsman [ph.] at an A.M.E. [African Methodist Episcopal] church came to my office one day and had a big pack of flyers because we had to get people to vote. See what I, what I did is I said let the citizens decide then, you know if we can't decide among ourselves, let's vote. We put--let everybody vote. So then we had to let people know about it. And so you know I had no money, the city didn't have money for this. And he brought this big box of flyers. Then I--there's another man who had an organization of young people in the projects. And I--he had this big bus. And I said, "Reverend, if you'll please bring some of the parents to the board meeting, the board of trustees meeting at the library." 'Cause see they had a board of trustees, both those members were wives of former council members. Nobody even really knew about the meetings, you know they just gonna have their little--and decide what was gone happen with the library. So of course I knew when the meeting was. I said, "I want you to take the people and make a presentation." And they said they, they were so surprised (laughter) when those people got off the bus and went in. So I mean that just shows you, you know if there's some direction, people are willing to do. You know they're willing to do. I mean that's--that was just so gratifying to me. And so we got out the vote and I mean like three to one, people wanted a library. And so they built the library. And we have a--they built a new library. So we were even able to keep the old building, and we have a brand new library. Then the other thing I was able to do is we have a clinic, Grady clinic [East Point Grady Health Center, East Point, Georgia], which--now that's the first time I ever--myself saw people picketing because there was some people who did not want the clinic. They didn't want it there and they were actually walking around the city hall. And I thought what is going on? But you know for some reason or another they didn't want the clinic. And I knew that clinics were now coming to communities rather than you having to go downtown or try to find 'em, and we needed it. So we built it, and it's there. And it just makes me--every time I see it (laughter), I'm happy it's there.
Story_ID: 618140
Speaker 1: Also, a velodrome. We have a cycling track in East Point [Dick Lane Velodrome, East Point, Georgia]. And when we were getting ready for the Olympics [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia]--and this is when I first became mayor too because I knew the Olympics was coming. I said we need to have that as our venue. So I wrote Billy Payne [William Porter Payne] who was in charge of the Olympics and I must have--I'd write him one letter and I'd get a letter from somebody else, and then I--I have a--probably a pile, a big pile of letters that I wrote back and forth to the Olympic people saying that we want our track to be the venue. Well it's in a neighborhood, but we talked about it long enough that we could have built it someplace else. Well you know what they ended up doing, having it at Stone Mountain [Stone Mountain Park, Stone Mountain, Georgia], which is the park that's already here. And spent a couple of million dollars to build a track there. And they didn't even want it, and they have since taken it down. And our track was the only one in the Southeast that we already had one. And so that just kind of shows you it's not about a legacy, which I thought it was something that the city would be really proud of. And what I, what I did in my plans, is I--Atlanta Christian College [Point University, West Point, Georgia] is in our city. So I made arrangements for the riders to be able to stay there, you know, during practice, at the dorms because you know it was in the summer. And so we still managed to have some of the prac- the teams practice there. And then I was able to get some of the schoolchildren to go and watch 'em. I mean it's something to see because they use a motorcycle to raise, you know, that the bicycle people trace, or, or chase, a motorcycle. But anyway, so I was happy about that because see we didn't--the city didn't have money to fix it. It was a little short than what it needed to be for regulation. So I kept trying to ask people to give me funding, and I finally got some money from a fund from the governor's office. But then it was such a small project that a lot of our people didn't wanna do it, see because they were working on big projects for the Olympics. And finally I got someone to do it because we had to do a handicap toilet and they had to fix that extra little piece. But anyway, it's going, it's going good now and they have a program for youth and so it makes you feel good when you see things. We had no business association. And one of the former members of council said, "You know you've got to have somebody that you can bounce ideas off of." He said, "I will be your chair and you just give me some names of people." So we had our business association. Then he died and another man--no the lady, she just took over. She said, "I'll do it." She was--happened to be a banker. Then she was transferred to another bank, another man took over. You know I mean it's been that kind of cooperation during the whole time. And so we've got a really good--it was called the East Point business, East Point--cooperative economic development committee; that's what it was called first. Then I saw a person who had this big organization in Atlanta [Georgia]. And I invited him to our meeting and I said, "We need to be at a different level; we need to be--have our own association." So he came and told me how to do it. So then we have now the East Point Business Association. And every city needs a business association because that's really what keeps things going. And of course I guess the crown jewel is the marketplace, Camp Creek Marketplace [East Point, Georgia]. And that was, that was just a thrill to have. And we had such an exceptional developer because he came and he surveyed the community to see if we could really support a project such as the one we have. And then he started doing all the things that you have to do to make it happen. But he was not a person who just wanted to come and leave. But he came--I remember before it opened, he had a breakfast and he invited all the managers of all the stores out there. And he had a video that he showed 'em about the churches, the police department [East Point Police Department], the fire department [City of East Point Fire Department], and all the schools just so they could get an idea of what the city was about and they would know more about the city than just their little business. And then he said there's a possibility that you can help this one or this one. And then he talked about what he did, he read stories at one of our elementary schools. And he really did that. I mean he would come by my office and he'd say, "I was just reading at Parklane [Parklane Elementary School, East Point, Georgia]. I just came by to say hi." I mean you know and so he has since now moved on to another place, but I mean to me he really had an interest in the community and not, and not just wanting to build and, and get away.
Story_ID: 618141
Speaker 1: Let's just go back a little bit because I mean this is, like you said the crown jewel of, you know, what you accomplished as a mayor. Talk more about where the plaza [Camp Creek Marketplace, East Point, Georgia] is, and you had a little controversy because people wanted it to be in downtown Atlanta [Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --rather than out here in the outskirts in, in East Point [Georgia]. So talk more about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were--of course you know they came and surveyed it and found the, the right location, they were all trees, you can imagine, all trees. I mean and now it used to be you think of them saying timber, you know, one tree at a time. But there's some way or another they were able to cut like Monday the trees were there, the next day they were absolutely gone. And so they--the community finally understood. I mean it's not that I was against downtown, but that takes a different kind of development. And then if you have a lot of different people who own property, see it just happened we were fortunate that there was one family who owned all the property that this man was able to develop on. So you didn't have to go through a lot of owners and sometimes when they know that you're getting ready to build something, see then of course the prices go up. So once we were able to get good anchors, you know like Target [Target Corporation] and Lowe's [Lowe's Companies, Inc.] and once you get those, then it's easy to get all of the others, they fall in because they all wanna be together. And so you know that took some--but this developer--I was also anxious to have people in our community working on the project, just building the project. And so we had a gentleman from Atlanta who was able to come out and talk about contractors. And so that we had all races of people and the developer had a meeting with the contractor. There was a notice out if anybody who wanted to be involved at that level. And they met at one of the hotels and he talked about what was required and what they'd pay 'em and the kind of training they had to have. I mean that was how interested he was in providing, you know, a really good service to, to our community. It was just--and he never, he never quarreled. I mean any suggestion we had, like we wanted a police precinct. And see some of those were some of the things that kind of satisfied the citizens who were unhappy with it being. They built a police precinct. They also built a fire station there and made it too small. And I had to go to a meeting there because they had promised to make it larger. So we had to go up and get because she actually--the chief wanted to be able to have meetings with other fire departments and there was just was not enough parking room. So they did that. And see those serve a dual purpose because you can have community meetings in those rooms, you know, when they're not in use. So that, so that really helps the broader community as well as providing safety. But we had some problems see because (unclear), between another large intersection where there are a lot of trucks. And so some of the people felt that they'd be squeezed in, you know, with all these trucks traveling and it was a, a state road and we were quarreling with the neighboring community and--but I think now people are very happy and I never once go to that shopping center without seeing someone who knows that I had something to do with it. I was just at the dog, pet, PetSmart the other day and the lady who works there was telling everybody, "Do you know it's because of her that we have this shop here" (laughter). So you feel good when it's a legacy that helps people and continues to help people.
Story_ID: 618142
Speaker 1: Okay, so we were still talking about you being mayor of East Point, Georgia. And talk to me about the international role, international communications.
Speaker 2: Okay. Well that part has been really interesting because that came about as a result of my membership on the U.S. Conference of Mayors. While I was mayor, I joined that organization and I had heard that it was really for cities forty thousand plus. And I thought well, shucks, we were thirty thousand. And I still went 'cause I said now I wanna learn what some of these other cities are doing. And that's a great organization because it's mainly mayors. And so you're able to kind of speak one on one with them, and with their staff people and how they did things and what the results might be if you don't do it this way or that way. There's another organization, the National League of Cities, and that's for everybody--that's where the mayors and council members and city clerks and all, so that's big. But the mayor--and a lot of your mayors don't go to that, some just go every now and then. But most of 'em prefer to just go to their group. And so I enjoyed that, and that's how I found out about the travel. One of the--I guess one of the first things I did is I went to Japan on that tour. And I think it was me and one other lady and about three men and we met in Tokyo [Japan]. Well they had been at another meeting first, so they all went together, but I went by myself and met them in Tokyo. And it was such a fast trip because we, we went to several cities. And you'd have to have all your bags packed and you know how you give gifts to people after--when they meet you and so we'd be on a bus and they'd say, "Okay everybody, eyes right because the press is there, eyes left." Or you'd get off and you'd have to have your gift with you. Well see I didn't know the kinds of gifts I was supposed to take. So I took things like, like the books of all the terrible things about Atlanta [Georgia]. And you know I should have had little, nice little paperweights or something like that. But you know you learn. So I had to have that ready so that when we got off and met the officials. But it was, it was interesting the kind of respect or lack of, you know because they were not used to seeing women and I was the firs- there were two women. One was Kay Granger who is now a congresswoman in, in Texas. But she was late joining us, so it was just me and about, you know, the four men. And so whenever they'd say mayor and they'd always turn to one of the men, you know, not thinking that I was a mayor. And--but it was interesting because you'd see really interesting projects. We saw development, you know, of cars, how they're actually building cars. We went to Hokkaido [Japan] to see they do ice sculptures and I mean it was just--it was really fascinating. And I guess one thing that I really liked is that they have all these different cities, but yet it's Tokyo they talk about. And so I kept thinking why can't we do that? And I kind of got in trouble when I came back here saying that 'cause I thought you know, every--really Atlanta is the place. And nobody knows East Point or Hapeville [Georgia] or College Park [Georgia]. Can't we just all be Atlanta and see I knew when I first became mayor here and I would go to a meeting, nobody--they're all from someplace else. I mean they're all from Hapeville, College Park or whatever. The minute you leave this area, they're all from Atlanta. And I'd see these people. I said, "Now you're not from Atlanta, you're from Decatur [Georgia]." But see they, they wanna be from Atlanta, but they're not here. But when they're here, of course they wanna be. So I was thinking when I looked at Japan and how that system is. But then I understand because see they're all the same, they're all Japanese. And so that makes it easier. I mean I finally realized it after reading some of their literature that it would not--it's not as easy to do that here as it was perhaps there.
Story_ID: 618143
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Through those travels, what were you able to gain? What knowledge did you gain to bring back to help you as mayor here in East Point [Georgia]?
Speaker 2: Well, that was one of them because I, I had to stop saying how we need to all be one because we're all very--we have our distinct differences. And, and we respect those and we're still good, but we can't consider ourselves all Atlanta [Georgia]. But then they need to be true to who they are and not speak against Atlanta when they're here, you know, which would truly happen statewide. 'Cause if you notice, it's very difficult for someone from, from Atlanta to be elected to anything statewide because everybody is against Atlanta, you see. So when they all join forces, Atlanta never wins. But I mean that's true every place. I mean that was true in Denver [Colorado]. It's true every place I guess because there's some--envious of the, of the city, you know, the capital city. But China I enjoyed because that was--they were doing a lot of building there and getting away from the--now they were trying to get away from bicycles. Remember how you see everybody riding bicycles. And they wanted more transportation. But it was--the thing that impressed me there is the respect for elders. And you know I, I think--I tend to think of us being respectful. Not nearly as respectful, though, as people in Africa. But in China they have--I was interested in visiting the senior facilities. And you know we were just getting so we were having more of them there, but they had a lot of daycare facilities there, you know where everyone worked at the home. And so they had a place for the parents to go during the day with, with a lot of great activities. And then they could come back. So that was something that was interesting for me because we have our senior citizen place here now, and we have since added a daycare for people who--they can drop their parents off, you know, while they work, and then pick 'em up and--and I think we need more of those, we really do. Because they had a lot of 'em there and I guess mainly because so many people worked out of the home and they--it wasn't a place to stay overnight, but just a place for them to be. But in some cases, if people did have to be gone for a week or so it was like a respite, a place that they could go, you know, for a short time. Then I went to Italy and I love Florence, Italy. The mayor's actually office was in a castle. Can you imagine? But and the people just didn't realize it, you know I mean here they're around all this art, and they just took it for granted. So what I went to talk about we--in Fulton County [Georgia] we have this arts council [Fulton County Arts Council]. And it's really great. And they encourage the art council, they encourage cities to develop their own pattern of art. Do whatever--whatever you want to do, each city. And they provide a certain amount of funding for you to do that. So I was talking about what we did, and I was surprised 'cause you know we had to wear the--for the language, we had to wear the earphones and all. And then people would come up. And I got so many questions about--we had a cul- we have a cultural enrichment commission. And so every council member appoints someone to this commission. And then the commission decides on the activities they're going to have. And everybody wanted to know about this commission and how--so I thought well golly, if they have something like that, then it would really teach their people about the art. That they're--they're living among it, you know, and just don't take advantage of it. I guess that's often perhaps the case then, you know your--somebody else has to come in and, and tell you what you need to appreciate, which is already yours. But I think that was, that was beneficial.
Story_ID: 618144
Speaker 1: I mean the trip was beneficial. And then also it's just talking to the people you're with, you know, because I was with one mayor, Mayor Boxer [ph.] from a city in Illinois. And they were fixing up their auditorium. And it was an old auditorium that they had let just sit. And then he finally was able to get somebody interested in it and, and give them money and they're revitalizing that. And that is something that we really--I was hoping that we were gonna do that with our auditorium [East Point City Auditorium] here in East Point [Georgia]. It's still just sitting there and I'm still hearing some talk that they may do something. But you know funding is tight and that's what happens, you know, when you don't have money. But then my exciting trip was of course to Africa with the black mayors' group [National Conference of Black Mayors] and that was led by [HistoryMaker] Wellington Webb and his wife [HistoryMaker Wilma J. Webb] from Denver [Colorado] and Mayor Boxer so I think went to that one. And there was somebody from Alabama. And there were probably just about six or seven of us. And we went to Senegal. And we saw the women who were in elected office and women mayors. And the only difficulty is that they speak French. But you know there's some things that you just automatically know. I mean you can communicate, you know. We had a--and then in Ghana we had a forum where we were supposed to be talking about developing and, and involving your citizens in activities. And see it's a little different. You can't just take in what you do in the U.S. to a, another country because in Africa the chiefs own land. See we can sit here and make all kind of rules about land here, but you can't just take a chief's land if he owns it. So you can do all the other things, but then you have to get special permission to do that. And so that generated a lot of discussion because some, you know, people, I mean they knew that. And some of the U.S. people, you know, were not aware of it. So some things we can do that are similar, but I always believe that you need to know what they do. What, what do they do and what is their purpose, and then let's help them perhaps do it a better way, or maybe a different way, but not necessarily our way. 'Cause our way may not be--so it's, it's good to be in those kinds of discussions because it lets you know, sometimes how you put your own ideas on people when they're--when you shouldn't, you know. So I guess if anything, that's one thing that I learned. But I just really appreciated the opportunity, you know, of having to--having--being, being able to do that.
Speaker 2: So how long were you mayor?
Speaker 1: Thirteen years. I say thirteen because when I first ran, they extended the time. They were trying to get all the elections at the same time. So when I went in, I didn't realize that I was gonna be in for an extra year. And so that's why that unusual figure. But the terms are four years each, so I was a three term mayor.
Speaker 2: And you were the longest mayor?
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay. And what made you decide not to run the last time?
Speaker 1: Well, I just decided that I maybe wanted to do some other things. And I, I think I kind of wanted to focus a little bit--I did an--started an educational taskforce when I was mayor, and we actually produced a document. And that was in '98 [1998], and I hate to say that things are in pretty much the same situations they were in when we produced that document. And so I just kind of wanted some time to do some other things and perhaps spread my wings a little bit. And, and then really travel with my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III].
Story_ID: 618145
Speaker 1: I know that you and your husband were involved in trips to Egypt. Tell me was that during the time that you were mayor [of East Point, Georgia], or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right. It actually started before, 'cause we--my husband had this study ever since we came back from Liberia. I mean he had been studying even while we were there and he said he wished that he knew more while we were in Africa 'cause he would have been close to going to--you know, seeing some of the things. But when he came back it became a real intense study. And so we'd have friends that would come to the house and they'd say, "Asa [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III], you told us about this. When are we going? When are we going?" So he said, "Well, set it up." He turns to me, "Pat [HistoryMaker Patsy Jo Hilliard], set it up." So what I did here in Atlanta [Georgia], I heard about--well there was a, a Henderson tours [Henderson Travel Service]. And she did tours to Africa. So I called her and set up an appointment for her to set up a tour for Egypt. And she did, and it was really just kind of a, a tour that was all ready--it wasn't a specialized tour, it was just one of the ones that--a package tour. But she wholesaled it to Moses Hanania, who was Palestinian and had his own company, but he did a lot of wholesale work for her. So he worked on that tour. So we--for the first couple of--we did it the one year. And after that, Asa knew exactly where he wanted to go and what he wanted to focus on. So then we really set out and had a, a whole, complete line of places that we wanted to see. And we started doing it every--and she did it I guess for about three or four years. And then we went to Moses. And he did it from then on, Consolidated Tours [Consolidated Tours Organization, Inc.]. And it was just--it was wonderful, it was first class. I mean we stayed in very nice hotels. Because you have to be comfortable, that's just like with volunteers, when they are Peace Corps volunteers, they have to be in a nice home. They have to have a toilet. They have to have air conditioning in order to do their job. And so with us, you know it had to be comfortable. And we had a lot of physicians who would go because they got the credit. And we also gave credits from Clark Atlanta University [Atlanta, Georgia], what is that, college credit for continuing education credit. So a lot of people took the, the travel for credit. A lot of the teachers--it was a two year, two year--two week tour. And we went to Giza [Egypt], which is where the pyramids are. We went to Aswan [Egypt] and we went to Abu Simbel [Egypt] and Luxor [Egypt]. Giza, let's see we started in Giza and then we went where the pyramids are, then we went to As- to Luxor, then to Aswan, and then to Abu Simbel. And it was wonderful.
Speaker 1: And so how many years did you do the tour (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) We started in '83 [1983] until '07 [2007].
Speaker 1: Do you, do you know Dr. Ben?
Speaker 2: Very well. Very well.
Speaker 1: ben-Jochannan [HistoryMaker Yosef ben-Jochannan], because he started those--a tour from New York [New York]. I mean just maybe forty or fifty years ago (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, that's right. My husband--he--I remember him coming to San Francisco [California] at a lecture we had way before we moved here [Denver, Colorado]. Yeah, we know all of 'em. As a matter of fact, we would sometimes have our tour at the same time. And Asa and I would always go over to see Dr. Ben or vice versa, you know, to see his, meet his group. Yeah we--and we went the year after Asa passed, we went back and had memorial service in '08 [2008]. And so now my daughter and son-in-law will be doing tours, and they're planning one for next year.
Speaker 1: So how many times did you go back, go on the tour?
Speaker 2: I went ever year.
Speaker 1: Went ever year.
Speaker 2: One year I went twice (laughter).
Speaker 1: And I just wanna get the years that you were mayor, from '93 [1993] until--
Speaker 2: Seven [2007]--or '93 [1993] to 2005, the end of '5 [2005]. Ninety-two [1992], I was elected in the last time my service was the end of 2005 (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 618146
Speaker 1: Now you also hosted a, a television show. How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well I started with a radio show because I decided that people didn't really know a lot about what was going on in the city. So I had--it's a WTJH Radio [East Point, Georgia]. And it was a studio, it wasn't East Point [Georgia], it's no longer here. And it was 'In the Know with Patsy Jo.' And I would have different people from the community come on and tell what they do. Like we did--I'm big on Meals on Wheels. I work with the senior citizens up in Fulton County [Georgia]. So we have the person who does the Meals on Wheels and he'd talked about how they put it together and how he needed volunteers to help. I had a representative from the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] talking about what was going on there and how we need people to belong to that. I had somebody--I had a tribute to Coretta King [Coretta Scott King] the year she died. I remember I had several people who worked with her. And the one thing I was really disappointed--I had Lin [ph.] who was her real close confidante, and he's now I think with the Girl Scouts of New York [Girl Scouts of Greater New York, New York, New York]. But he actually stayed with her up until she died. And they forgot to put the tape in. You know, see I have tapes of all of 'em, but when I finished, he forgot to put the tape in. So I didn't have his message. But it was really, it was really good. And I did that for people to hear maybe a different side than what they'd always heard. I had one lady who had been Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assistant for all those years and she arranged a tribute to him when he passed. And so just--you hear little tidbits, you know like they said Mrs. King always sent cards to all of her family members, birthday cards and things. You think as busy as she was, you know, she had the time to do that. And then I had her niece on, Alveda [Alveda King Beal] who I remember her coming to San Francisco [California] with Mrs. King as a, you know, I guess a teenager or college student. She used to travel with her. That was A.D.'s daughter. And now I notice that they're doing some things for A.D. [Alfred Daniel Williams King]. Have you noticed that they're--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --because apparently he did a lot and it's just like we said, you know, there's some people who do a lot and they're never recognized. And so they're beginning to plan some tributes for him. But so those are--I started that way. So then they encouraged me to do the television. So I kept it the same name. And I did Atlanta Interfaith Broadcasters [Atlanta Interfaith Broadcasters, Inc., Atlanta, Georgia]. And I was ready to start it the year my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] died, that fall, I was gonna have the opening. So anyway, I went on and had it that--and it was funny 'cause I--as you see I talk a lot and I remember my son [M. Hakim Hilliard] made the introduction of me that evening and he said, "Well I hope that you get a chance to hear the people talk because my mother" (laughter)--and sure enough, I had to laugh myself because I--Cynthia McKinney, I had her, I had interviewed her. So I asked her to come for that opening. And I guess I was doing all the talking and I hardly gave her time to talk (laughter). But she really is my hero. I just--I have really admired her stand and I would always visit her, you know, when I'd go to Washington [D.C.]. And I just--you know she just has a different way of dealing with things. But I think she cares about people and I guess that's why I was so attracted to her. But I enjoyed the show. And see I had one man who was the former president of Morris--of Morehouse medical school [Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia]. And he's a, a specialist in, in diabetics. And see what people didn't know that about him when he--and I just--I wanted to introduce people. Tell something different about them that you maybe didn't know. And so he talked about Paul Laurence Dunbar and the dialect, you know, on television. That was kind of neat.
Story_ID: 618147
Speaker 1: You mentioned that during this time your husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III] passed away. Talk about--tell us about that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well it was really--he was--we were in Egypt. And he had gone to Ghana first for, I think for a week. And then came back and then the next two weeks we were to go for our regular tour. And he had cerebral malaria. And that just took him out. But I said he certainly had a mission and he was able to--I mean he, he would not want to pass any other place but Egypt. Yeah, it was really quite sad. But we had, you know, so many people came to pay their respects. And people--you know you forget where you knew people 'cause golly I've been around for over seventy years and you, you forget. And you know maybe--well I know I, I can't remember who I knew where. So then I was seeing all these people and I was thinking--I couldn't remember. But I was just happy. But see now I'm getting so I can read the communication and the tapes and things and it's a little easier to do it. I'm most anxious now to get his papers so that they're accessible for people. So we've--Georgia State [Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia] has been to look at them and I have an appointment tomorrow with Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia]. So what I may do is split 'em. I don't know. Wherever people can get to 'em so that they can do it for research and, and then of course there are many books and things. My children will I'm sure use 'em. They probably don't have room to, to put 'em right now, but and see you know it's easier to get books now. You know it used to be that it was difficult. But I think you can have a lot of different ways that you can get old books, so I don't know that they'd be of value to people. But I do want his papers 'cause I'm getting calls now from former students or teachers who want information and I just don't wanna just let you know, I wanna keep track. So--but I'm ready to do that now.
Story_ID: 618148
Speaker 1: When you look back over your life, is there anything that you would do differently?
Speaker 2: What would I do? Gee I, you know, I may think--well that's something I've not really thought about. I would--'cause I think I've involved--if anything, I probably would wanna involve more people in what I do. You know sometimes you just assume that people know everything about everything. And you--then once you have a conversation, you realize that they really don't and they appreciate knowing. And, and mainly, I like to know about people. See I'm always asked to speak and I look in the room and I think golly, anybody could have told this story. And I just wish I'd spent more time making people understand that they have a story to tell. You know, that every- everybody and I--everybody has a story. And you may not think it's interesting, but it is. You just need to talk about it and make sure that your family understands it. So if anything--I, I just wish that I had written--'cause see the older you get, you forget. And there are a lot of things that I'm sure would be very important for my children to know and I can't remember a lot of 'em (laughter). I mean if someone says something, I'll remember. But unless they do--. See so I would perhaps do pretty much what I've done, but I would, I would want to write it down and share it with people so that more people could be involved and do the same thing.
Story_ID: 618149
Speaker 1: Because this video is going to be available for very--for a lot of generations from now on, is there a message that you'd like to send to the future generations?
Speaker 2: Well to, to be true to your convictions. Don't let anybody tell you that you can't do something, because you can. And always seek help. Number one, course my Lord and Savior is the one that I go to all the time in all situations. And it's interesting because you know if you're really praying for something, you know somebody else is praying for it too. So it has to be the Lord's will, whatever he has for you, that's what will be. But you just have to have faith and trust in someone who is the head of your life, and that's the heavenly Father. I don't know how I could have made it this far without that because I--He's always been number one, he or she (laughter).
Speaker 1: Is there anything that we have not talked about that you would like to talk about?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) I think I said everything. Golly, I think, I think I've said pretty much, you know I think one interesting thing with being mayor [of East Point, Georgia], from a city manager form of government. Which means that the mayor does not have so called power, but it's just your interest and your caring about people that can lead you to do things that are not written down. So you don't--it's not about power. But it's, you know, why are you here? Do you wanna be a representative of your people? Like many people said to me they'd never been in a mayor's office. I had an open door policy so everybody could come. So I just--I can't think of anything else (laughter).
Story_ID: 618150
Speaker 1: Well, if that's all, and I just wanna make sure you talk about the different organizations. Because we talked about The Links [The Links, Incorporated] and the Eastern Stars [Order of the Eastern Star] and you just kind of glanced over, you know over NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], but I know you're with them so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh yeah, a life member of the NAACP.
Speaker 1: Right, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Life member and on the executive board. And, and it's interesting because when I came to Atlanta [Georgia], I had always been a paid member. But I had never been an active member. So one of the first things I did is to look in the telephone directory and find out where the office was. And I called and I think they were so shocked. I said I wanna volunteer. And my first job, and this was in '80 [1980] the election when I moved here, they needed somebody to--for get out the vote. And John Dell [ph.]--she had someone who brought a bus in from South Carolina or someplace. He drove it, and I was on the bus with him. Well neither of us knew where we were going, and that had to be so funny. We stopped and got some children, they were out of school, and asked permission for them to go with us so they could tell us the location. 'Cause see we were going to schools, taking people to the polling place, and didn't know. But that was just--we had an excellent executive director at that time (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, well I wanna thank you so much for taking time to tell us your story. Because it's gonna be an inspiration to so many people. And so just thank you so very much (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Oh, I hope so.

Speaker 1: That was in the Green Room in the White House [Washington, D.C.]. You know every year the president will always have all the mayors from the U.S. Conference of Mayors go there for breakfast. And it is really the president's house now, isn't it? The White House. I mean it's really--I'm sorry--it's different (laughter). I mean it's still nice, but it's different (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): (Simultaneous) So who was the president?
Speaker 1: Well this was--might have been Bush [President George Walker Bush] (background noise). It was probably Bush. But you know it's different now because it's, it's really the people's house. So now it's got that feel.
Speaker 2: Golly, I can't remember his name. You remember he was the one with the--golly, he was Fannie Mae [Federal National Mortgage Association], he was the head of Fannie Mae. The head of Fannie Mae and his wife (laughter), and me and my husband [HistoryMaker Asa Hilliard, III].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.

Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Can you tell us the occasion of this photo?
Speaker 2: This was election night when I just got the first election.
Speaker 1: And this was when Vice President Gore [Al Gore] was at a meeting. That must be the U.S. Conference of Mayors meeting. It was so exciting during that administration because we'd have all the secretaries present. And it was just exciting, you know, the audience. They brought--
Speaker 2: Now this was in Senegal with the U.S. delegation as well as the--see there's Happy. Did you see her?
Speaker 1: Happy Haynes [HistoryMaker Allegra "Happy" Haynes].
Speaker 2: Happy Haynes. And I think I knew her mother [Anna Garcia Haynes] and father [LeRoy Haynes].
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA VOICE): Okay.
Speaker 2: That was in Ghana. That was--you remember hearing Mayor James [Sharpe James] from New Jersey and Plusquillie [sic. Don Plusquellic]. Poor James, he was mayor and in the state legislature [New Jersey Legislature] at the same time.
Speaker 1: And these are my museum friends (laughter).
Speaker 2: Do you remember their names?
Speaker 1: Golly, isn't that terrible? Mary Knell [ph.] and Terry [ph.] and Kathy [ph.] and was it Brenda [ph.]? Mary Knell, Terry, Kathy, and she's the one I should remember. I don't know, that's terrible. Lonnie [ph.]? Brenda? I'll kick myself when I remember that after (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This was--Hillary [Hillary Rodham Clinton] was the convocation speaker at Spelman College [Atlanta, Georgia] in '92 [1992]. And I was there, this is Johnnetta Cole [Johnnetta B. Cole] who was the president of Spelman, and [HistoryMaker] Maya Angelou and me. That was so exciting. And I took my picture to the White House and she signed it almost immediately.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: Now, this is my mother who had the charm school [Jessie Morrison's School of Charm (ph.)], and this is one of her shots with her models. The first person is me, and then Melba Austin [ph.], Lois Clydus [ph.] and my mother, Jessica Morrison.
