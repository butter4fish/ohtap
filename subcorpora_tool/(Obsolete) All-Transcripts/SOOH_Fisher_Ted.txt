 Finchum  Today is April 26, 2011. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with the  Oklahoma State University (OSU) Library, and I   m in Sapulpa,  Oklahoma, to speak with Ted Fisher about his memories of Henry  Bellmon, former governor and U.S. Senator. This is part of OSU   s  Spotlighting Oklahoma oral history project. Thank you for having me  today. Let   s start by having you tell a little bit about yourself, where you  were born and about your youth, and then we will work our way  forward.  Well, I was born in Holton, Kansas, in 1941. My family moved to Jenks,  Oklahoma, and I spent all twelve years, elementary through high   school , there and on to college from there at NEO  Northeastern  Oklahoma A M College . I played basketball and then to Northeastern  and then to TU  University of Tulsa . I came to Sapulpa and somehow  wound up running for the senate. I spent twenty years in the senate, from     86 to 2006. (Laughter)  In high school, were you interested in politics?  On the fringe, but got more interested as I grew older.  Did your parents discuss it around the dinner table?  Yes. My mother was a Republican, and my dad was a Democrat so it  was kind of some interesting times around the dinner table, yes.  You graduated high school from Jenks?  Jenks.  From Jenks. And then what was your major in college?  5  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Business.  At what point did you decide to get into politics?  It   s kind of interesting. I, along with others, some notable people, hall-of-  famers, Roy Clark and Walter Merrick and a group of investors, were  going to put in the first racetrack in Oklahoma when that became legal.  We lobbied for that. I got involved in the horse racing issue. God was  good to me, we didn   t get the track. (Laughter) And we spent a lot of  money, time, and effort. I lobbied for some things about racing in  Oklahoma City. I had always been civically involved in this community,  in Sapulpa, and so I thought maybe I could get some things done. I spent  my career doing that.  Campaigning has changed quite a bit from the first round to the last.  Oh, it sure has. It   s a whole different story now.  And term limits, if they hadn   t come into play, you might still be there?  I was actually ready to come home after twenty years, but I also found  that it   s pretty hard to   there   s pressures on you to stay without term  limits. And I   m not for term limits. I think it   s a bad deal, but neither  here nor there, it is what it is. So when it came my time, the term limits  got me. Well, fine. I was glad to come home.  Well, in your youth, did you grow up on a farm or did your parents do  other things?  An acreage, but we farmed that acreage. We had cows and pigs and  chickens and did a few crops, big gardens, and things like that, but not a  farm. It was sort of a metropolitan farm.  They did other things for income, then?  Yes, yes.  And your favorite chore or least favorite chore?  Milking. My dad milked for me on game days, not on practice days, but  on game days so I played every sport. (Laughter)  He didn   t figure that out, did he? (Laughter) So 1986 is when you first  ran?  Yes.  6  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Were you aware of Henry Bellmon at that point?  Oh, yes. Sure. Of course he was popular and famous before that, but  that   s when he also won his second term as governor.  Do you remember your earliest experience with him, the first time you  met him?  Yes, I think I had casually met him before, probably on a campaign trail,  I guess, but I didn   t get to really engage with him. When I was elected to  the Senate, well, he proposed very early on a gas tax increase, which we  very much needed. He was in the pro tempore   s office, and he was  calling and seeking an audience with senators, one-on-one, to talk about  his proposal. We had a great discussion, and I was very much for it, and  we needed it. He was right on target, and so we kind of started off our  relationship there.  On good footing.  Yes, really was.  Were you present when he was sworn in the second time?  Yes, sure. Sure. I went to the inauguration, yes.  Was the atmosphere a little bit different since he was the Republican  governor and the House and the Senate were predominately Democrat  at that time.  Democrat, yes, and I was a Democrat.  How did some of that cross-party lines work?  Well, it worked pretty good. It worked pretty good. It was not near as  vitriolic as it is today. He was so fair and was not an ideologue. He was  a pragmatist as to what the state needed, and he just had the courage of a  panzer tank. It didn   t matter what newspapers said. And he and Mr.  Gaylord were good friends, but when he had made up his mind what was  right, he   s not dissuaded by anybody and certainly not by public opinion.  He was very courageous.  He made up his own mind. Do you have any idea what that process  might have been for him?  Number one, that process was his extreme intelligence. He was very  7  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  smart, and he was smart in a very common sense way. When he spoke,  he used the fewest words possible, and it was very clear what he was  talking about. There was no Oxford verbiage in his speech. It was  absolutely   you knew exactly what he said and what he meant. There  was no guessing about it.  Didn   t waste much time, then?  No. No.  Were you ever summoned into his office?  Oh, we had audience several times, but I wouldn   t call it summoned. It  would be,    Hey, can you come down and visit with me about this?    or  something like that. And, of course, you   d accommodate.  Were you ever invited to the farm?  Yes. I was there on his eighty-fifth birthday, which was not that long  ago. Three years ago or something.  Nice place.  Yes, it is. Yes.  I understand he had something to do with getting the timetable changed  for the legislature. They had to be finished by a certain time on     Right, right. That was a Constitutional amendment. Actually, that had  been proffered by Governor Bellmon and got it on the ballot, which was  a good thing. I was tickled to death. I mean, what gets measured gets  done. And when you don   t have to hit a wall, you don   t like to hit a wall.  You kick it down the road a little bit until we can find a better way, but  the session limits were a good thing.  He was in the House, too, back in the    40s, wasn   t he?  Yes. I think he was in the House at one time, yes.  So he may have had to work long hours and felt that needed to be done.  Yes.  He also crossed party lines to appoint Democrats to various committees.  Yes, yes. He was looking for the best gray matter. He wasn   t looking for  8  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  the best politician.  One of those, I think, was Hannah Atkins.  Right, she was the secretary of state.  Did he take much heat over those types of things?  Certainly I didn   t hear that because she was such a wonderful, classy  lady and so smart and just very   she was just exceptional.  She called herself the tea-sipping lady.  Oh, yes, yes. (Laughter)  Did he have a particular leadership style?  Well, I   m sure he did, but I   m not sure I can verbalize it. It was very  straight-forward. There were no hidden agendas, ever, that I knew. This  is what he wanted, and it   s what he would articulate. And you   d go try to  pound out the support for that. But he was generally well-trusted among  the population.  Did he encourage discussion or would he just come in and say what he  wanted?  No, no, no. He wasn   t dogmatic. He was an able politician. He stayed on  his course and would listen and would bend and would alter. He knew  there was compromise and intelligently dealt with that compromise.  Do you recall a couple of the major issues for him during that second  term as governor?  Oh, yes. House Bill 1017.  Talk a little bit about that, if you can.  It was passed by the House, but ran into trouble in the Senate. Certainly,  Republicans were   this called for a tax increase. It   s their theology that  that just couldn   t happen, and so forth. But we had some Democrats that  were not on board, and so forth. Senator Bob Cullison, who was  president of the Senate, and the governor, I was never in those  discussions with him because that was kind of pro tempore and  governor. And the governor said,    Well, I   ll try to deliver X amount of  votes,    and he couldn   t do it. He just could not rake them over. So just  through the skills of Senator Bob Cullison, as pro tempore, he very ably,  9  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  finally, after months and months, delivered the Democrat votes to pass  1017. But it was a very contentious time. Senator Cullison called a  caucus, a Democratic caucus, and it lasted seven hours. It was a  traumatic caucus, but at the end of the day, he got it done.  And then they voted?  Went straight downstairs and voted.  Before anyone changed their minds. (Laughter) Is it still on the books?  Yes.  Is it?  1017, is still alive.  Changed any?  Yes, it put much needed funding in our education system and through a  very small tax, actually. But it was very, very, I suppose you   d say,  critical at the time. Governor Bellmon, who didn   t listen to his party or  our party or anybody   s party, he just stayed right on course and never  wavered. Against all the editorials and everything they   d throw at him,  he never once wavered.  Wonder what planted the seed for him?  Oh, what he was for, it was certainly, generally, as a party, we were for.  He was accused,    You   re a Republican in name only. You   re not toeing  the party line.    He took some heat from his own party. But that   s what  needed to be done, and that   s what he did.  Let   s talk a little bit more about the environment that he created at the  capitol, as far as working with the House and the Senate and other  people there. A typical day with Bellmon in charge, would you see him  every day or ever so often?  I saw him pretty often because we both got to the capitol   I   d get there  at six-fifteen, six-thirty in the morning, and so did he. So I might go up  and have coffee with him or sip on some of mine, and we   d be talking  about different things. So I saw him possibly, there, but throughout the  day, rarely. No one does, ever. You   re up on the floor doing what you  do, committee meetings, and the governor is downstairs doing what he  does. So, no. I didn   t see him that often.  10  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Six-fifteen? Pretty early.  Yes, it is. I   m an early riser.  Commuting from here or did you live down there?  No, no. I lived there.  And, of course, wasn   t that far with the mansion. Where was your office  in relation to his? What floor in the capitol?  I was on the fourth floor. Governor   s office was on the second floor.  Is it fun working in the capitol?  Oh, well, yes     That might be described differently, but     It can be fun, yes. (Laughter)  I   ve been there when it was really quiet and then when it was really  busy. Were you ever on opposing sides with him?  Yes. I don   t even remember the bill that I was trying to get, but I was  sort of a business guy in the Senate   or economic development guy. I   m  sure I thought I had some bright idea. I don   t remember exactly what it  was, but he had spoken against it in the press. I went down to see him,  and I said,    Governor, I   m trying to grow a flower here, and you keep  pulling the petals off of it. There   s just nothing uglier than a flower with  no petals.       I   m not either, I   m not either. Let me talk to you about it.     We sat down and we talked about it, but it was clear that I wasn   t going  to tilt the windmills. It was going to get vetoed, and but I really  rethought my position, too. He caused me to rethink it. What I still think  might have been a fairly good idea, perhaps he was wiser.  He was a good negotiator, then.  Yes, he was. (Laughs)  Or a statesman in the true sense of the word.  Yes.  But at the end of the day, you   re still friends.  11  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Oh, yes, yes.  Were you surprised when he decided not to run a second time?  Well, he couldn   t run a second time. My service with him was already in  his second time. He had been governor in the    60s, and then he came  back in    86. So he was only there for one term, legally.  I thought he could have run for a second term.  I don   t think so.  Okay, well that explains that, then. If that hadn   t have been the case, do  you think he would have gone a second round?  I don   t know. I don   t know. I just don   t know.  Were you aware of much of what he was doing when he was in D.C. as a  Senator?  Only what I read in the newspaper. Of course, I didn   t know him then. I  only knew him from his second gubernatorial stint forward.  Did you have any interactions with Shirley, his wife?  Some, not much with Shirley. When he went out as governor, he had an  outgoing soiree in Tulsa. It was at a school in Tulsa, I remember. And it  was sort of an icy night. It was his farewell to all. It was very heavily  attended, and a lot of Democrats were there and a lot of Republicans. It  was a very bipartisan crowd, and I was honored to be one of the speakers  at that evening, out of about five speakers, I guess. And I had more  engagement that night with Shirley than ever before. I saw her often at  his side and so forth, but I never did get to spend much time with her.  Interesting story, I named the History Center, the grounds, after him. I  offered a resolution in the Senate to do that I mean, after he was actually  remarried. I wanted to do it, and I wanted to talk to Eloise, his wife,  about it. I called their home in Kingfisher and I said,    Eloise, this is Ted  Fisher.    She said,    Well, Ted Fisher     I said,    Did he hear you say my  name?    because my intent was to talk to her about it without him  knowing. She said,    Yes, he   s sitting right here.    I said,    Well, let me  talk to him.    I said,    Governor, I want to tell you what I   m going to do.  I   m going to name the History Center grounds in your honor. I   m going  to pass a resolution to do that. I think I can get it done.    He said,    Well,  there   s others.    He said,    What about Governor Keating?    I said,    Well,  someday somebody will name something after Governor Keating, but  12  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  right now, I   m going to name this after Henry Bellmon.       Well, Senator,  are you sure that   s a good      I mean, he just   he was very modest. He  wasn   t into this.  So I did. I made up my mind I was going to do it. That was on like, a  Thursday. On Saturday night, my phone rang, Saturday evening at about  six o   clock. He said,    Senator, this is Henry Bellmon.    He said,    Shirley  was a big part of my life and career, my political career.    He said,    If  you   re going to do that, do you think you could do it Henry and Shirley  Bellmon?    And I said,    I sure can.     Any other favorite memories of him?  Oh, yes. I   ve got a bunch.  Please share a few.  We went to Japan together, Governor Bellmon and I, and others from  the Department of Commerce, and the lieutenant governor was Robert S.  Kerr, III. We just had several experiences there that stand out in my  mind. I   m relying on a defective memory, but I think I can get through  it. He and I and, I think, the secretary of commerce was Don Paulson,  we went to the ambassador to Japan   s office. The ambassador to Japan  was former Democrat senator from Montana, Senator Mike Mansfield.  We were ushered in. We had an appointment. He got the appointment, of  course, but we went in his office and Mike Mansfield got up and walked  to Henry and shook his hand firmly and embraced him. And he looked at  me, and he said,    This might be the finest senator that ever sat on the  United States Senate floor,    which was pretty striking at the time. I  mean, you   re thinking,    Here   s a Democrat, and here he is lauding a  Republican senator.    But it was the respect that they had there, as well  as the respect he had in Oklahoma.  Also, on that trip, we were hosted at the grand tea masters, the  presidents, in a teahouse for a tea ceremony and a lunch. There were  several of us, Senator Jerry Smith, who was 6   6   , and Don Paulson was  6   5   , I   m 6   2   . Henry was a big man. I   m sure Lieutenant Governor  Kerr was there, I don   t remember all, but the grand tea master wasn   t  there because the emperor was sick, and he was doing tea at the  emperor   s palace. But his first assistant, I guess, was the one next in line  to be grand tea master that did the ceremony. Of course, the grand tea  master and the tea masters, they   re allowed to marry into the emperor   s  family. They   re a very regal bunch.  We were hosted by the grand tea master   s wife, who also attended the  tea ceremony, and it was very impressive. We sat on these tatami mats  13  with our legs crossed under us. And these can go quite long, and I  looked there once and all of us six-footers and above were going     readjusting and trying to get comfortable because it went on quite  awhile. (Gestures) (Laughs) It was kind of humorous. But then we were  hosted at lunch. And, now, this grand tea master   s wife was   I   m not  sure what finishing school is, but she   d been to ten of them. She was the  most elegant, beautiful lady, I   d say in her fifties, maybe sixty. She was  just absolutely gracious and demure and just elegant, an elegant lady.  She had a banquet table laid out for lunch, and in the center of this long  banquet table was a big centerpiece, and she sat in front of the  centerpiece. Governor Bellmon was on her right, and I was on her left.  Lieutenant Governor Kerr wisely got on the other side of the  centerpiece, and she couldn   t see him, nor him, her. At such a lunch, you  know they are serving you whatever is the finest cuisine that they can  offer. It wasn   t exactly an Oklahoma pallet pleaser, if you will. (Laughs)  To my left was one of our operatives from the Department of  Commerce. His name was Bill Moss. And I am struggling with this  meal. I mean, I am struggling. She was carefully supervising my  consumption, all of our consumption of that meal. Every once in a while,  when she would look Governor Bellmon   s way, to the right, I would  somehow have a chopstick mishap, and it might wind up on the floor.  (Laughs) But it was an unbelievable   they just kept bringing it. I don   t  know how many courses, I don   t remember how many, but it was  several, several courses.  One course came, and I opened up this pot, and there were a couple of  things floating around in there. And Bill Moss said,    Senator, how do  you like slugs?    (Laughter) Oh, I about lost it. I   ve got to be honest with  you, it was   I   it just was there. But then one of the courses was quail,  and I didn   t   I couldn   t personally look through her to see the governor,  always. She was between Governor Bellmon and I, but we had a   it  goes down that way, so the governor stuck the whole quail in his mouth  and just crunched the bones. (Laughter) None of us knew what any of  this was. I didn   t understand it, I don   t know. But he got it in there, and  he just had to go on with it, I guess. (Laughter) But it was a very, very  interesting time, and he was such an interesting and non-assuming man.  One day he called me, and he wanted to meet with me, after he was out  of it and working for OSU. So I said,    Sure.    We had an appointment. It  was in the morning, and I said,    Let   s go to lunch,    and he said,    Okay,  I   ll go to lunch with you.    So we go down and go to lunch. He   d  concluded his business for the day so after lunch I said,    Where   s your  vehicle? I   ll take you back.    Well, he had parked across Lincoln Street. I  said,    Governor, you   re a former governor of the state. You don   t ever  park over there again. When you   re coming you advise my office, and  14  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  there   s parking that is meant for you.    He then would always call before  he would come, and my assistant would always say,    Your parking spot  is reserved. It will be at the west door of the capitol.    So he started doing  that, but it took some doing. He just saw himself as another citizen.  That   s pretty special.  That is pretty special.  I don   t know. What else do you want to know?  Well, his last day in office, was there any function that day?  Well, actually, his last day in office was after session was over with so  we weren   t actually there. At the time, the session had not convened so  we weren   t there for that.  After he stepped away from politics, he was still involved in some way.  How often would you see him?  Well, when he went to work, he went to work for OSU. He was working  on research   to get some research funds and so forth for, I believe it  was, telecommunications and to create a real telecommunication  research mission for OSU. He and General Al Goodbary were  nominated, and so I became involved with that, too. We did a great deal  of travel and meeting with people and trying to raise the money and put  some traction to this project. So, yes, I spent a lot of time with him in  that. We went to Bell Labs in Austin. We went to Omaha. We would  frequently use the Noble Foundation plane to go where we needed to go.  I know in one of our travels back   well, we were coming back from  Austin, and so I said,    Where are you going to spend the night,  Governor? Are you going home or to Stillwater, or are you going to go  to Billings?    He said,    I   ve got to get to Billings.    He says,    I   ve got a  bull that   s down in the, sort of, the rear end.    And he says,    I need to get  up there and see about it.    I said,    You are worrying me to death.    I said,     You   re eighty-one or two years old,    and I said,    And you   re working  with heavy equipment and heavy animals. We   re going to find you some  morning in a corral out there or something.    I said,    You need to take  into consideration some things, Governor. I   m going to lecture you on  this.    So we talked about that.  We talked about the farm, which I asked Gail one time, I said,    Gail,        I stepped out of bounds. I told him, I said,    Why don   t you sell that farm  and everything?    She said,    Oh, I wish he would.    None of the  grandsons wanted anything to do with it. He was never going to sell that  farm, although he said,    There   s some people up there buying land  15  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  now.    He said,    Yes, I thought about it,    but it wasn   t going to happen.  That would have been too much.  You were at the level with him that you could say that to him and not     Yes. Well, don   t get me wrong. I was never at his level. But we had a  good relationship. I would have died for the man.  That   s saying a lot.  He was a dandy. He was unbelievable.  Any funny stories you might want to tell on him?  One of our trips, we were on a plane and I had remarried. Well, it wasn   t  two weeks later he and Eloise show up on the front page of the Daily  Oklahoman. And I called him and I said,    Governor, you   ve been  holding out on me.    And I said,    What   s this business?    He said,    Well,  you got remarried.    And I said,    Well, yes, but I wasn   t on the front  page of the Daily Oklahoman.    (Laughs) We joked about that, but it was  kind of funny. Eloise had said that he introduced her, they were out  somewhere, and    I want to introduce you to my fianc  e.    She said that   s  the first she had heard of it. (Laughs) I don   t know if she was joking or  not. I think I took it as the truth.  Another interesting tale about him in Japan, we hosted a reception for  about 450 Japanese businessmen, and it was a pretty nice reception. It  was in Kyoto. And the governor of Kyoto was there and, of course,  they   re a sister state of ours, Kyoto Prefecture. He was a real good guy.  He spoke perfect English, and so forth. But as the reception was going  on, there were food stations all around, and it was really good. I found a  couple of favorites, and I really went to town on that. So we were doing  quite well, and the band strikes up. The Japanese band starts playing,     I   m proud to be an Okie from Muskogee.     Imitates Japanese accent   (Laughter)At any rate, that kind of broke the evening open.  Then the Kyoto governor got up and he sang to us. Our protocol person,  who was Bonnie Witham, who was with Journey House Travels, she  said,    Governor, you   ve got to sing back to him.    No way was that  going to happen. She said,    Somebody   s got to sing back to him.    So  she and I and a reporter for the Tulsa World, it was a guy by the name of  Chuck Ervin, and the three of us got up and sang    Country Road.    We  were on the stage and down below, the governor was standing right in  front of us. He said,    Sing,    You Are My Sunshine   .    I said,    Well, you  get up here and sing with us     And he did. (Laughs) So the four of us  sang. It sort of laid the moment.  16  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  I can never think of the words to those two songs. You know the name of  them.  Yes, I know it. (Laughs)  It would be kind of hard to sing on stage.  Am I boring you?  No  It   s the human side of   stories are fun.  Okay.  I   ve been asking people to share one or two things that are not  commonly known about him. Would you be able to do that?  No, I don   t know that I know anything   any deep dark secrets. (Laughs)  Well, I know that he   s written a couple of books, so is there anything  that has not been written that needs to be documented somewhere?  Well, I   ve read his books, but I     How was he in committee meetings?  He rarely came. I remember he came to one committee meeting. I don   t  remember the subject matter, but it was of some importance. And he was  there to make sure it passed, but rarely do the governors go to committee  meetings. One interesting thing that   yes, there is one thing that might  be commonly known with a few people, but not widely known. He  would be in a meeting, and the meeting would be going on, and he   d be  sitting there   (Imitates sleeping). Someone was speaking and he   d  just   (Imitates sleeping)      Eyes shut and everything?  Oh, yes, just totally, eyes shut, closed, you   d swear he was asleep. I   d  look over and he   d have about five or ten questions of something he  said   the speaker said. Or he would be sitting there asleep while there   s  banter going back there, and he   d say,    That   s not right.    I mean, you   d  swear he was asleep. Well, he wasn   t asleep. (Laughs) I don   t think it   s  something the public generally knew, but we, certainly the legislators  knew, we knew. You didn   t want to make the mistake of assuming you  slipped something passed him, because you didn   t. (Laughter)  17  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  He was just resting his eyes.  I don   t know what it was, but you   d swear. I told others one time, and I  told him I said this, that if Henry Bellmon says he   s got to sleep on  something, you might have an answer before the end of the meeting.  (Laughs) At any rate, he was a pretty interesting guy, but he was pretty  conversant on any subject. He had taken some pretty courageous stands  in the United States Senate that spoke of his courage. I think history has  treated him pretty well. One on bussing and one on the Panama Canal  and those were very controversial in a state like Oklahoma, especially  with Mr. Gaylord pounding on you every day. It didn   t matter. He did  what he thought was right. It turns out he did.  He did, and he got reelected after he came back. So he didn   t make too  many enemies.  Well, I mean, we had just gotten out of the Vietnam War, and we  weren   t ready for another jungle war. We didn   t have the stomach or the  appetite for it. That is exactly where, had he not   and he was the  spotlight vote. He didn   t let it go down that road.  I take it he must have been well read?  Very well read.  In order to make intelligent decisions.  He just had an innate capacity for absorbing information. I   m sure he got  it through reading a lot because, well, we   d talk about it. I went to see  him when he was in rehab at an Enid hospital. I would, on occasion,  drive up and see him. Actually, when he was in the hospital I went to see  him and everything. He was absolutely up-to-date on every current  event. He was always asking,    What do you think about this deal? What  do you think about that deal?    We   d get into some pretty deep  discussions about it, about whatever was hot at the time.  He probably knew the price of wheat every day.  Oh, yes and cattle. (Laughs) I asked one time, I said,    How are the cattle  prices?    He says,    They   re good, they   re good.    I said,    Well, did you  sell?    He said,    No.    I said,    I just don   t think I could be a farmer or a  rancher.    I said,    I thought that was the game, when the prices got up,  that   s when you sold them.       Oh, well, no,    he says,    That isn   t always  true.     What do you think it is about you that you were able to bond so     18  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Oh, I don   t have any idea.  Any idea?  I don   t have any idea. I just have an immense amount of respect for him.  I guess, maybe, he sensed that. I don   t know.  Were there other Democrats that were as close?  Well, I   m sure there probably were. I don   t think he judged you on  party. I don   t think he judged you on what you looked like. I don   t think  he judged you on anything else. I think he just possibly could look inside  people closer than     Maybe just didn   t judge, period?  Yes, he probably didn   t. I   m sure you can   t run and be in as many  offices as he was and not create enemies. And I know he did, but it  generally was because he would not do their bidding. And if he didn   t,  he thought he was right about that. And I would venture that he was  right a lot more than he was wrong.  Well, if you wanted to sum up what his legacy might be for the state, I  know House Bill 1017 is one of them.  Certainly. House Bill 1017 is one. That was so much rancor. I would say  that would be the number one thing, but also, up against the backdrop of  today and Tea Parties and so forth and so on, but that was his second tax  increase, because he knew it had to happen. It had to be. He wouldn   t  swear allegiance to the other theology. When you got to have it, you   ve  got to have it. When you need to make changes and improvements, you  need to do it. And you   ve got to keep moving and stay forward, and he  was not afraid to do that.  If you were to see him today, would you address him as   ?  Governor.  Governor, would you? And he would refer to you as   ?  Senator. Yes, he would.  Not as Mr. Bellmon or Henry, it was Governor?  No, we would probably be   although, I never addressed him as Henry. I  19  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  Finchum  Fisher  don   t think he ever addressed me as anything other than Senator.  Even after you were out of it?  Yes, yes, but it would get so easy. It   s not that you   re trying to be  formal, it   s just   I couldn   t get over when I was first elected,  everybody, it was,    Senator this, Senator that.       Just call me Ted     I  mean, I couldn   t get over this. Finally, one of my colleagues took me  aside and said,    You   ve got to get used to that because that   s the way it  is, and you   ve got to quit correcting people.    He was giving me pretty  sage counsel. And I did, I quit, finally. I mean, it was because it just  sounded so shallow.  But after twenty years, you got used to it?  Yes, I finally got used to it. (Laughter)  Anything else you want to add before we close?  No, except I sure am admiring the work you   re doing. He   s worthy of  being memorialized this way.  Well, thank you so much for your time today.  Thank you.  -------  -------
