Story_ID: 667914
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's [Lucius Lomax] side.  We'll start with your mother's side first.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: So, my mother's full name is Hallie, H-A-L-L-I-E, middle name, Almena, A-L-M-E-N-A, maiden name Davis, D-A-V-I-S, married name Lomax, L-O-M-A-X [Almena Lomax].
Speaker 1: And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Her date of birth is July 21, 1915, Galveston, Texas.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How, how far back can you trace them and what are the stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: Oh, so a little more convoluted on my mother's side of the family, a little--we don't have as much documentation.  Her father's family was from--we think had some Jamaican, West Indian background because in the 19th century around the time of the Civil War part of that family, the Davis family, was in New Jersey; and we think they were, his father [Dewood Davis] was a seaman who became a longshoreman and we think that they were, their occupation was naval.  Her, her paternal grandmother [Katie Bell Davis] was from Mobile [Alabama]; and when they married, when the two of them married at some point in I think the 19th century they, they located to Galveston, where he stopped, you know, being a sailor and became a longshoreman.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They had several sons.  The younger son was my grandfather Clifford [Clifford Davis].  And they sent him to school at the Emerson Institute in Mobile, Alabama--it was an American Missionary Association school founded after the Civil War for the education of the freedmen, and got a pretty good academic education.  I think some college--there's a dispute in the family about whether he attended Tuskegee [Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute; Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] for some period of time.  But he was, he was literate.  And after getting married, well, we'll talk about my grandmother [Geneva Marx Davis], but they moved to Chicago [Illinois] and he got a job in the post office [U.S. Post Office Department; U.S. Postal Service] and did some additional, took some university courses at the University of Illinois in Chicago [Chicago Undergraduate Division; University of Illinois at Chicago] to get a teacher certification, which he never wound up getting, but he was sufficiently educated to get that.  Don't really know--can't, can't go on his side of the family much beyond his parents.  And so, working class but, you know, I guess middle class aspirations.
Story_ID: 667915
Speaker 1: My mother's family on her mother's side was biracial.  Her mother's mother, Hallie Lewis [ph.], was apparently born in Montgomery [Alabama] prior to the Civil War and somehow or another relocated to Mobile [Alabama].  And we don't know much about her; we have a photograph of her, and she was what, what appeared to have been, you know, mixed race, straight hair, keen features, not sure all of the details of her life.  But she--and I think she may have gone to Emerson Institute [Mobile, Alabama] as well because she was literate and she had a good script so that that suggested she was, you know, had some formal education.  But in 1890 she's in a relationship with a white man from Pascagoula, Mississippi, and living in New Orleans, Louisiana in the Treme; and she gives birth to my mother's mother, Geneva--named Geneva, last name Marx [Geneva Marx Davis] after her father George Marx [ph.] who was a white man from Pascagoula--think of, you know, Jewish.  And I would, you know, probably a--if, if the name they gave her is any suggestion, you know, probably from somewhere in the Swiss--in the Alps region, you know, from Geneva [Switzerland], and they give, that's the name they give her.  And so, that this daughter was born in--Geneva was the only child to that--well, I can't, I don't think it was a marriage so to the two of them.  And she--my, but my great-grandmother Hallie, a seamstress, dies, you know, when my grandmother is in her teens and living in Mobile--and she's a, Hallie was a seamstress.  Geneva goes to Emerson, learns the--but does learn to be a seamstress 'cause this is, this is her profession throughout her life; and she meets Clifford [Clifford Davis] and they get married and move to Galveston [Texas] and then ultimately to Chicago [Illinois] and have three children: an older son, Clifford [Clifford Davis]; a, my, my mother [Almena Lomax] who is the middle child; and then a youngest child, Gwendolyn [Gwendolyn Davis Collier].  Remain in Chicago from the--I would say Gwen, Gwen was born in Chicago, I think, so probably around 1920 to early '30s [1930s].  In the early '30s [1930s], my grandfather who, my grandfather who was emotionally very intense, has a extreme mental breakdown and is institutionalized in the state mental institution, and remains there until his death at the age of ninety-nine, yeah.  And, and the family migrates to Southern California in the early '30s [1930s].  And while my grandmother would go back and forth to Chicago, my mother remained in Los Angeles [California] where they moved to; and, and became part of, there was a large Mississippi Gulf Coast community in L.A., always from the beginning, moved to Watts [Los Angeles, California] in the early '30s [1930s].  And people that my grandmother had known from Mobile and, are in the neighborhood; and so even though my grandmother would go back and forth to Chicago, my mother and the other, her siblings, all remained there.
Story_ID: 667916
Speaker 1: Your mother [Almena Lomax] was about, what fifteen [years old] when she moved to (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I would say she was probably in her, about--so she went to, she finished high school, Jordan High--Jefferson [Thomas Jefferson High School] and Jordan High School [David Starr Jordan High School].
Speaker 1: In, in--
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles [California].
Speaker 1: --Los Angeles.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Went to school with, you know, Tom Bradley, I mean, that was--Tom became a family friend from that point.  But, yeah, so she went to, she finished high school, then to L.A. City College [Los Angeles City College, Los Angeles, California] to study journalism.  When she realized she couldn't get any internships because she was black, she goes to work at the California Eagle and begins her professional journalistic career in the, in the mid-'30s [1930s]; and she continued to do that until she retired in the '80s [1980s].
Story_ID: 667917
Speaker 1: My father's family--I'm gonna switch over to my father's family.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, can you give us his full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 1: My father is Lucius Walter Lomax [Lucius Lomax]--he's the third, although he was called Junior (laughter).  So his, his father and his great--his father and his grandfather [Lucius Lomax, Sr.] all had that same name.  Father was born in November, I think the 3rd, 1910, we believe in Brenham, Texas, but maybe Houston [Texas]; we've never found a birth certificate.  He was born to Minnie Deignan [Minnie Deignan Lomax] and to Lucius Walter Lomax [Lucius Lomax, Jr.].  My grandfather was a, had been born in 1878 in, in Brenham, which was a, you know, cattle country kind of rural community.  My grandfather was always a, he was a horse- he, he was good on horseback, he was a strong marksman and, you know, he's definitely a westerner.  But by 1910 he had already fought in the Spanish American War in the Philippines putting down the Moro Rebellion, the Moro Muslim insurgents in the Philippines, and had returned with a--he, they, the story was he, when he got on the, the boat to return in 19--he went there in 1905, when he got on the boat to return he had twenty-five cents, when he got off he had twenty-five thousand dollars.  He was a gambler and he started buying real estate in California, Washington Sta- and Washington State; and but also still had property in Houston, and in Houston in 1910 he owned a pool hall and barbershop.
Story_ID: 667918
Speaker 1: My grandmother, Minnie Deignan, D-E-I-G-N-A-N [Minnie Deignan Lomax], had been born in Charleston, South Carolina in 1889.  And she's the person we actually know absolutely the most about.  She, both her parents were the children of mixed race couples.  The Deignans [Mary Ann Deignan and Francis Deignan, Sr.] were her father's parents.  Her father [Francis Deignan, Jr.] was a white man, third generation Irish, living in Charleston, owned a ship building business on the Cooper River; married a free woman of color.  And we think, we would say married because they remained together and she inherited his property after his death, and they're b- they were buried together.  And Emmaline Marshall [Emmaline Marshall Deignan], free woman of color born we think in the--probably the 1840s.
Speaker 2: Do you have a sense that she looked like she was white too, or she (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, she didn't.  I think, I think, I think we have a photograph of her, we just can't be absolutely certain that she--but I would say probably brown skinned, you know.  But the, in the South, the Irish weren't just, they were just a step above, you know, free people of color.  And so, they lived in the same area, near the Emanuel A.M.E. Church [Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, Charleston, South Carolina], I mean, that whole area of the--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --call, called the Neck in Charleston is where--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --the free people of color lived so that they were near where the slave revolt was by, you know, in--and, and where the freed people of color were but also where the Irish were and where my grand- my great-great-grandfather's business was.  They had about ten kids.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the slave rebellion you're referring to is Denmark Vesey's plot.  Right.
Speaker 1: The Denmark Vesey, yeah, and, you know, and, you know, and so that, they lived right near the church, not very far, they lived--(laughter) of all the names of the streets, America Street, you know, they lived on America Street.  And--
Speaker 2: Now that is, for people who haven't been to Charleston, I was there for the first time--
Speaker 1: Um-hm.
Speaker 2: --right, right after the shooting at the church.  And it's a block away from Francis Marion park [Marion Square, Charleston, South Carolina], with a--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --with a giant--a huge fifty foot pedestal with John C. Calhoun on it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's, the, the, the Neck area is anything north of Calhoun, literally, and so that's where, you know--
Speaker 2: It's Calhoun Street, right, right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, and, and so it was, you know--so they lived in that area, my great-great-grandfather had his Deignan brothers shipyard on Town Creek off of the Cooper River.
Story_ID: 667919
Speaker 1: But it was a significant business because that--we have a map that shows the streets of Charleston [South Carolina], and Deignan brothers shipyard is, is marked on it.  He was married to and lived with a free woman of color, but he was a Confederate blockade runner, got arrested for it; so he was supporting the Confederacy.  My great-great-grandfather--well, then on the other side, so this is, this is the side that produces--so the, that great-great-grandfather's name was Frank James Deignan [Francis Deignan, Sr.].  His son, Frank James Deignan, Jr. [Francis Deignan, Jr.], mixed race is, you know, his heir along with his brothers and sisters; and they inherit the, the shipyard after he dies.  On the other side--Frank married Elizabeth Ann Poyas, P-O-Y-A-S [Elizabeth Ann Poyas Deignan], who was the, the daughter of a white man, William R. Poyas [William Poyas, Sr.], and a free woman of color, Hallie, another Hallie, Hallie--and we, I think, we think her name was Hallie Smith [sic. Hannah Wing Poyas], and we think she had somehow--well, she was a free woman of color, it's hard to say where she came from.  They had a number of children and their oldest daughter was Elizabeth Ann Poyas.  Now, the interesting thing about the Poyas side of the family is that this was, you know, everybody says they're, you know, come from the prominent white South (laughter), so these people were the, they had a big plantation, the Poyases.  Yeamans Hall [Berkeley County, South Carolina], which was the home of the first colonial governor, they were descendants of him.  And, you know, but one of their progeny married a free woman of color--or lived with a free woman of color.  He fought in the Confederate navy, you know, even though he at that point had children by this woman.  And, you know, so, and but remained with her after the Civil War, and she inherited property from him after his death.
Story_ID: 667920
Speaker 1: Elizabeth Ann Poyas [Elizabeth Ann Poyas Deignan] and Frank James Deignan, Jr. [Francis Deignan, Jr.] marry; they had five children, oldest of whom was my grandmother, Minnie Deignan [Minnie Deignan Lomax].  And she gets an education, she goes to the Avery Institute [Avery Normal Institute; Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, Charleston, South Carolina], an American Missionary Association school from the age of, I don't know, she was there, she was, so she was born in 1889 but she graduates from Avery in 1913 and goes to, goes--19--graduates from Avery in 1903 so she's about fourteen years old.  And goes from there to Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee], gets an undergraduate degree at Fisk and then moves, gets her first job in Houston, Texas, and that's where she meets Lucius [Lucius Lomax, Jr.].  So, that's, that's how that family came together, you know.  So, and it's, it's that generation of my grandparents who are the generation that begin the migration out of the South--some up to Chicago [Illinois] in the case of Clifford [Clifford Davis] and Geneva [Geneva Marx Davis], and then west to Los Angeles [California].  My grandfather Lucius began leaving Texas traveling west to California in the early part of the 20th century; and leaving the country, he went to the Philippines.  And at one point, when, I'm not exactly sure when it was, but he spent a year living in Yokohama [Japan].  So, you know, he, he was a, he did a lot of traveling.  And then my--and that was my father's father.  And then my father's mother, the educated one, gets her teaching certificate, goes to Texas, gets pregnant, you know, has a baby, doesn't get married, turns my father [Lucius Lomax] over to his paternal aunts to rear; and then she takes a, she teaches for a little while in Norman, Oklahoma, she teaches for a little while in rural Texas for a year, and then she moves to Chicago, goes back to--she gets a job in the Chicago Public Schools in 1914 or something like that, and goes to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois] and gets another bachelor's degree; and brings my father back and rears him in Chicago and then she gets another, gets a master's degree.  So she had a good career teaching, but highly educated.  And she was the one who enforced education in the family.
Story_ID: 667921
Speaker 1: And dad, and my father [Lucius Lomax] went to the university of--went to Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] from 1918--in 1928 he went, started in 1928, became an Alpha [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity]; his mother [Minnie Deignan Lomax] was a Delta [Delta Sigma Theta Sorority] at that point (laughter) so also get involved, gets involved in fraternities and sororities.  He transfers to the University of Illinois [Chicago Undergraduate Division; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois] because my grandfather [Lucius Lomax, Jr.] at that point had bought a insurance company and he wanted him to have a degree in actuarial science, and that's what he got his degree in.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, so, your father basically grew up in Chicago [Illinois]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, fa- well, he grew up in Chicago but spent his summers in, in Seattle [Washington] and where the, the family had a farm in Yakima [Washington].  He came up in a very privileged environment that, so by this age my grandfather is, you know, owning a lot of real estate along the West Coast.  Grandfather started off, I told you he was a gambler but his ultimate major, you know, financial source was that he had by the early 1930s when he moves to Los Angeles [California]: he's the numbers banker for Los Angeles.  So, you know, that's, you know, that's a very significant income base in the demimonde.  And so, and he's buying real estate in Los Angeles.  But father, so, you know, father wanted for nothing.  My mother [Almena Lomax] on the other hand, poor and struggling.
Story_ID: 667922
Speaker 1: Well, that's quite a history.  I mean, that's (laughter)--
Speaker 2: That's a lot, (laughter) that's a lot of--
Speaker 1: That's quite a history, it is (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, a lot of stuff in there.
Speaker 1: It's rich, there are so many directions--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --any of these stories could go, you know?
Speaker 2: But, you know, so the interesting thing is that we actually, you know, and, and I would say, we know a fair amount about some of these actors.  I mean, we, the, the Charleston [South Carolina] stuff we've traced all the way back to the 17th century.  I'm a member of the Sons of the American Revolution, you know, because we were able to document that white [paternal] great-great-grandfather [William Poyas, Sr.] whose family owned the plantation [Yeamans Hall, Berkeley County, South Carolina]; well, he was descendant of, you know, of somebody in the Revolutionary War so we got through that.  On my father's [Lucius Lomax] side, that Brenham [Texas] history and, and his fam- his, his grandfather [Lucius Lomax, Sr.] was a murderer and went to jail and got murdered when he got out of jail.  I mean, so it's really, I mean, it's, it, what I find so interesting about it is that it's a rich variety of people who after the Civil War and during Reconstruction, as the black community is really beginning to form locally and around the country, people from all different backgrounds get thrown together.  So, I mean, it's not like, you know, there--it's not like middle class people only deal with middle--I mean, it's just, it's, there's, there's this kind of dynamism to it until you get this mixture of people from all kinds of backgrounds who are, are, particularly if they're in urban centers, they're trying to build community and build institutions and establish what today would be a more structured African American community.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.  And segregation kind of forces people to live close (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and it forces them to live very close together.  And, you know, and in the case of my grandfather who was the numbers banker, I mean, he was, you know, he owned an interest in the black hotel [Dunbar Hotel] in Los Angeles [California], he owned the bar there.  But, you know, when he went out fishing and there would be stories about Lucius Lomax [Lucius Lomax, Jr.] goes fishing and he's taking out the guys who are the founders of the Golden State Mutual Life Insurance Company.  I mean, there was a kind of inter- interaction among people which wasn't nearly as rigidly structured as it is today.  And a lot of these people were related to one another (laughter) in addition to everything else, you know.  It's a small community of strivers.
Story_ID: 667923
Speaker 1: Is there a story about how your parents met?
Speaker 2: So--yes, there is a story about it.  So, well, my [paternal] grandfather Lucius [Lucius Lomax, Jr.] moves down to Los Angeles [California], he moves into the Dunbar Hotel [Los Angeles, California].  And we believe that, I believe that he financed the purchase of the hotel which had gone under during the Depression [Great Depression].  Been, it was built by a Dr. Somerville [John Alexander Somerville], it was called the Somerville [Hotel Somerville], it gets bought, its name changed to the Dunbar and a man named Mr. Nelson [James Nelson] runs it.  Well, Mr. Nelson was also from Brenham, Texas, by way of Chicago [Illinois], and, and was distantly related to my grandfather.  He takes over the, the ownership of the hotel, grandfather lives in the hotel and buys the bar and which he turns, gives to my grand- my father [Lucius Lomax]; and my father runs the Dunbar bar and lounge [Dunbar Cocktail Lounge and Grill], which was a hot, cool place to go.  And you can, and this is, the Dunbar is on Central Avenue, the, it's the main drag for the African American community.  Everybody who's anybody stays at the Dunbar: Duke Ellington, Count Basie, you know, Billie Holiday--I mean, they're all there.  And the afterlife, the afterhours life of Central Avenue is where all of the, you know, the white movie stars who want to hang out with black people are down there.  The, you know, the clubs run everything from--you know, the Club Alabam [Los Angeles, California], which has its, its, its, you know, dancing black women, you know, brown skin revues, to Brother's [Los Angeles, California], which was a transvestite afterhours club and I've got a photograph of my mother [Almena Lomax] there; you know, so I mean people are, they're going everywhere.
Story_ID: 667924
Speaker 1: My mother [Almena Lomax] at this point is working for a woman named Mrs. Bass [Charlotta Bass] who is the owner of the California Eagle.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Very well known figure.  And mother is pretty much, you know, writing, she's writing everything from, you know, a youthful column to reviews of music; she's getting to know Duke Ellington, she's, and Billy Strayhorn, his arranger, she, when, you know, he writes a piece, she's reviewing it, she's, you know, she's getting to know, you know, I, you know, [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade; and, I mean, just a whole bunch of na- but and Carmen's younger than mother.  But, I mean, the whole, this is, all the people who are art, artsy, are involved in politics, are running businesses, its, its, they're all along Central Avenue.  Well, my father is running the, the bar and lounge there [Dunbar Cocktail Lounge and Grill, Los Angeles, California] and she goes in there and they also had a little lunch stand there and, you know, for thirty-five cents you get your lunch.  So she goes in there and has lunch and she starts--my father is married to somebody else at this stage and they, they get to knowing one another.  And in 1940 my father is, you know, in '41 [1941] they're about to go to war [World War II, WWII], my father doesn't want to join the, the war because he knows that even though he's educated he'll wind up in a--'cause, you know, all you could do is be a cook or a, you know, cleaning up behind people or an orderly; you couldn't get a, you couldn't be an officer.  So, one way to avoid the draft is to buy a newspaper and be a publisher.  And he buys a little, he buys a little church newspaper called the Tribune [ph.], installs my mother as the editor and he becomes the publisher.  And that's the founding of the Los Angeles Tribune, which was their paper.  Mother stops working for the Eagle.  And by '44 [1944], mother has one child, my older sister Michele [Michele Lomax], although Lucius [Lucius Lomax] is married to somebody else.  And 1947 they had two kids and--'cause I was born, and, and, I think, shortly thereafter a scandal, my first time appearing in the newspaper was a photograph of me and my sister as a part of a big divorce in Los Angeles [California] where, you know, we were the love children of the, in this, in this triangle.  And--
Speaker 2: So, they actually published this in the paper?
Speaker 1: Oh, no, they didn't publish it in the paper, it was in every other black newspaper in the United States--in the Pittsburgh Courier [New Pittsburgh Courier], and the, you know, and the, you know, you, the Baltimore [Baltimore Afro-American; Afro-American Newspapers]--I mean, all the newspapers, and including all the competition: the Sentinel [Los Angeles Sentinel] and the Eagle in Los Angeles, (laughter) they published it.  They, my father's ex-wife [Carmelita Black Cortez] to prove that he had two children out of wedlock with somebody else had, had a photographer come by and offer to take pictures of us kids (laughter) and beautiful little picture and it, you know, that was the picture that wound up in the newspaper.  So, they got divorced, my parents get married; and they run the paper together from the 1940s until the paper dissolved in 1961.  So, I don't know where exactly they met, but whatever it was it must have been hot and heavy 'cause, you know, it broke up a marriage and produced at the end of the day six kids.
Speaker 2: Now, now, did he have any children by the previous (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, he had no other children.
Speaker 2: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 1: Thank god, that would have complicated this story even more, you know.  But they were, and they ran a good paper, it was a well known paper but the real advantage of the paper was that it was subsidized by my grandfather [Lucius Lomax, Jr.], I mean, up to a point.  My grandfather owned the building that the newspaper was located in and they char- he charged no rent.  And he would, and, and I think he purchased some of the major equipment, I mean the equipment was pretty expensive.  But my mother would not, not write about the numbers and stuff and so he didn't like that.
Story_ID: 667925
Speaker 1: You said something off, off camera that--that your mother [Almena Lomax] was, refused to be interviewed for [HistoryMaker] Stanley Nelson's 'Soldiers Without Swords' ['The Black Press: Soldiers Without Swords'] about the black press (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Right.  Yeah, well, when Stan- and, that was the first time I met Stan- I, I had any dealings with Stanley.  And, you know, it, the, I think, can't remember the exact year but by that point a lot of the people who were major figures in history (laughter) were dead.  One of whom was Charlotta Bass and mother had worked for Mrs. Bass and, and she really could have told the story but mother was a contrarian to the end, so she refused to be interviewed.  And, and so, the story, her story and the story, her connection to the Eagle [California Eagle]--because Mrs. Bass was, you know, one of the first black women publishers in the, in the '20s [1920s], 20th century and the Eagle was a very important paper.  And so, her story didn't get told.  But the good news is that mother did leave behind a number of manuscripts for fictionalized storytelling of her, of her life and one of which is about that period of, around the Eagle and the beginning of the Tribune [Los Angeles Tribune] and the dealings with Mrs. Bass and, and you know, all of the relationships, you know, who was paying off whom and all (laughter) that sort of stuff.  So, I mean, the story won't get told, didn't get told in 'Soldiers Without Swords' but it does get told if I ever publish 'The Women of Montgomery' [Almena Lomax] it'll get told.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, I hope you do.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 667926
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their sense of humor, how they walk, how they talk, what they look like--who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I think, I'm a combination.  I mean, my father [Lucius Lomax] was, you know, he lived a very privileged background.  He, you know, his, his parents [Minnie Deignan Lomax and Lucius Lomax, Jr.] weren't, did not live together but my grandfather took very good care of dad.  And if you look at all, look at all of his pictures from growing up in Los--in Chicago [Illinois] I mean, he's wearing, he was always dressed very nicely and he's, you know, he's going to very expensive schools, Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois], University of Illinois [Chicago Undergraduate Division; University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois], he's going to California for the summers and all that kind of stuff.  He loved to read, you know, British mysteries.  He loved, you know, sort of screwball comedies of the '30s [1930s].  I, I have some of my dad's tastes.  But my mother [Almena Lomax] was much more serious in many ways.  She was, in many ways she was self taught, I mean, she, she didn't stay in college; but serious about literature, you know, so she, she read everything from Langston Hughes and Richard Wright and Baldwin [James Baldwin] and all those to, to Faulkner [William Faulkner].  I mean, she actually corresponded with Faulkner, who read the Tribune [Los Angeles Tribune].  She, so she had a much more serious literary bent.  But I think what really differentiated my mother, just hard worker and very ambitious.  I mean, she, she wrote that newspaper, twenty-four pages of tabloid.  She wrote, she was the number one writer, wrote for it twenty years and had, you know, so she pulled herself up by her bootstraps but she al- was also very politically committed.
Story_ID: 667927
Speaker 1: I think she was charmed by my father [Lucius Lomax], but the charm wore off.  And, and you really saw that it wore off in, beginning in 1955 when she was so intrigued by the bus boycott in Montgomery [Montgomery Bus Boycott]. Then in '56 [1956] she just decided she had to go visit it.  And, you know, for (laughter) a very small newspaper to send anybody out of state to cover anything, I mean, she had to, she, she, she made it a community project, she note- she, for weeks before she left she said, you know, the Tribune [Los Angeles Tribune] is going to--"Tribbie Is Going to Dixie" [ph.] was the headline.  And so, people had to pay up in advance on their subscriptions, people had to donate, finally she got enough together and she wrote enough copy so that the paper could be published the week that she was gone; I always joke she told, she wrote the news a week in advance.  And I was supposed to go with her and I can't imagine a nine year old in 1956 going to Montgomery, Alabama, and I didn't go.  But she did, she went, she flew to Montgomery.  She was well known as a journalist and, you know, she interviewed Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.], she had dinner at the home, she meets, that was when she met Dr. King, she met Ralph Abernathy--all of the people and she stayed there for one week and she wrote about it firsthand.  And she came back and she was never the same.  I mean, this was a story that she was absolutely committed to.  I mean, she had tried to engage my father in politics.  I mean, in 1952 she was a delegate to the Democratic convention [1952 Democratic National Convention, Chicago, Illinois], he was an alternate.  She ran my dad for the, the state assembly [California State Assembly], she ran him for the Los Angeles City Council.  Daddy didn't want to do any of that stuff.  He wanted to, you know, have a nice social life, play, play golf, and live the life to the manner born; and my mother [Almena Lomax] was just not interested in that.  And so the, by '56 [1956], I think her head had been turned by the Civil Rights Movement, and she was committed to not only covering it but being engaged in this social justice movement.
Story_ID: 667928
Speaker 1: Now, so who am I the more alike?  I, I obviously have elements of both.  I loved my father very much.  My father was charming, he was wonder- but he was also a caring and loving parent, and we were very, very close.  I lived with him periodically while growing up.  And, and, you know, I would say I'm a lot like both of my parents [Almena Lomax and Lucius Lomax] but the, the two figures who I think defined my personality even more were my father's parents.  My grandmother [Minnie Deignan Lomax] who became a teacher, who was, I mean, she, when she, when she retired from teaching in 1944 and moved to Los Angeles [California], you know, she, she was a part of an, a reading club, she wrote book reviews for the newspaper, she wrote a column on society for the--so she was, she was a woman who was highly educated and used her education purposefully and she had a life, a rich life of the mind.  I mean, she was doing everything from going to, you know, I, when, when her book club read 'Black Bourgeoisie' [E. Franklin Frazier]. I thought it was about the boudoir, you know, I couldn't tell, (laughter) and it was years later I found out it was an indictment of the black middle class.  You know, the first, I mean, I remember when she made my father take her to see the first Brigitte Bardot film.  I mean, she was, she was pushing (laughter) the envelope on everything.  My grandfather [Lucius Lomax, Jr.], on the other hand, the numbers banker, was probably one of the steeliest men I, I knew.  When you'd go over to his home, he lived in this huge house on Adams Boulevard, twenty-four rooms, swimming pool, tennis court, I mean, he, at this stage of; and he spent, every week he would go to the art auctions and buy big oil paintings, he loved pictures of sheiks riding across the deserts, which is the orientalists.  And--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --huge house but you, if you stick, stuck your hand in the back of a chair you'd find a pistol because he was still running the numbers and people were still bringing him the cash every day and, you know, there, he was, (laughter) you know he was gone protect his money.  And, you know, he was dealing with some really tough customers in L.A.'s underworld.  And, you know, he and his, his group kept--there was a notorious white gangster called Mickey Cohen, they kept him out of the black community; as long as they were running the numbers, Mickey Cohen couldn't get in.  So, I mean, I, I think, I have a lot of these people in me.  I mean, obviously, I haven't chosen a life of crime like my grandfather, but I have chosen activism, I've chosen education; and literature and the arts have always meant a great deal to me.  So, I mean, those are, all of them have helped to shape who I am, and I think about them every day and I hope that, you know, I'm living a life that's worthy of who they were (simultaneous).
Story_ID: 667929
Speaker 1: Now you were telling me earlier that you might be re- well, you are related distantly to Louis Lomax?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: The journalist who--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --wrote about the black (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) 'Negro Revolt' ['The Negro Revolt']--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and he also wrote about Malcolm X.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And one of the?
Speaker 2: I didn't know Louis, I mean my dad [Lucius Lomax] knew him and so he would have been related to my dad.  His, his grandfather, Louis' grandfather, and my grandfather [Lucius Lomax, Jr.] were distant cousins.  You know, they're not, Lomax is a relatively unusual name so, you know, but so, but they were in fact related.  And Louis ended his career in Los Angeles [California].  I think my parents knew him, I didn't know him.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Had no contact with him.  Although there were other literary figures that I did meet.  I mean, I think the person I knew the best was John Oliver Killens, the novelist, who was a good friend of my mom's [Almena Lomax], they were good friends.  But, you know, I mean, that literary and intellectual world of the 1940s and '50s [1950s] was relatively small, everybody knew one another.  I mean, if you pick up one of Langston Hughes' Simple books ['The Best of Simple'], he talks about the humor of the black press and he refers to mother.  And so, I mean, these, I mean, they were people corresponding with, you know, you find correspondence with Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] who read the paper [Los Angeles Tribune] or others.  You know, these were, they, this was, the, the black community and the, the quote, unquote celebrity community was much smaller and not nearly as self regarding as it is today.  I mean, I actually met Du Bois.  I mean, I, we, you know, I think he spoke in, he spoke in Los Angeles [California] in the '50s [1950s] before he went to, to Ghana and I was in the audience and after it was over, you know, he had a press conference and mother was at the press conference and I got to meet him you know (laughter).  I mean, these were, these were real people.  When, when Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] came to Los Angeles after the bus boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott], you know, he, mother had had dinner at his house, he came over and had ice cream and cake at our house.  We went and picked him up at the Hotel Watkins [Watkins Hotel, Los Angeles, California] where he was staying, right down the street from where my grandfather's home was and, you know, and brought him over.  He, we all sat around in the living room on the floor while mother talked to him and then took him back to the Hotel Watkins.  I mean, there weren't these huge barriers between you and the people who were breaking ground for our community.  And, you know, and that's true in the, whether it was in hol- black Hollywood or it was in the black literary establishment or it was progressive politics.
Story_ID: 667930
Speaker 1: You know I mean, I met [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte while I was in elementary school [Arlington Heights Elementary School, Los Angeles, California]; and he doesn't want me to say this, but, you know, when he--he was a lefty, clearly; and I went to a leftist integrated day camp in the early '50s [1950s] in Los Angeles [California] and, you know, we had part of the--it was people from Hollywood and people from black news bring their kids together.  And the two leftists sort of Hollywood types who came and entertained us were: Harry Belafonte, I sat on his lap when he sang 'Day-O,' so I was very young; and George Reeves who played Superman, he was a lefty.  I mean, people don't know this about him and, of course, he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I didn't know that--I didn't.
Speaker 1: --he committed suicide later but he, I, he, he was leftist enough to be coming to an integrated day camp in Griffith Park [Los Angeles, California] in the early 1950s.
Speaker 2: Now, this is a time period where (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Dalton Trumbo, the, the playwright.  I mean, the, the, the, the--
Speaker 2: Screenwriter, yeah.
Speaker 1: --screenwriter.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I remember my sister turned sixteen [years old], Trumbo read the newspaper and she said, she made some comment, next thing we know there's a magnum of champagne that has been sent over from Dalton Trumbo.  But, and particularly the people who were on the far left and people who had been blacklisted because my parents [Almena Lomax and Lucius Lomax], my parents hired people who had been blacklisted.
Speaker 2: It was a dangerous time to be a lefty.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but--and, and, you know, and, and they hired and did not disassociate from, not only people who were on the left--and this I, this I do give my dad credit on this, I mean, he was, I think he was a, you know, a, a capitalist in the sense that his dad [Lucius Lomax, Jr.] was, but their friends were progressive whites as well as progressive blacks.  And, you know, you knew that people that they knew had committed suicide because they had been called before on the HUAC committee or they had had their--the House Un-American Activities Committee, or they had had their reputations, their ability to earn a living--.  And that was an interesting element of Los Angeles in the '50s [1950s], that sort of, the, the, that integrated community.  And the people who were in it, I mean, and most of whom were, are, are not alive today but, you know, my mo- one of my mother's best friends was a woman named Geri Nicholas [Geraldine Pate Branton].  Geri had, her first husband was [HistoryMaker] Fayard Nicholas, the, of the Nicholas brothers (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, right.   Yes.
Speaker 1: Geri, beautiful woman dancer.  Her second husband was Leo Branton [HistoryMaker Leo Branton, Jr.].  Leo Branton was the first black entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles and represented [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis (gesture).  So, I mean, these are the people you knew every day, were people who were, lived in the neighborhood, they were engaged in pushing the boundaries that still circumscribed African Americans even in a community like Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the, I was thinking about the McCarthy hearings, you know, all that ended in '54 [1954] with the, when, when McCarthy [Joseph McCarthy] was busted basically.  But and Dalton Trumbo didn't get another screenwriting job until 1959 (simultaneous)!
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, under the name of Dalton Trumbo but he was still writing.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he had (unclear).
Speaker 1: And he was still living in Los Angeles and one of the newspapers he read was the Los Angeles Tribune, and one of the columns he read was The Younger Side [ph.] by my older sister, Michele [Michele Lomax], and when she said she wanted something or another, he sent her a magnum of champagne.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Okay.  But I'm saying that, all I'm saying is this, this kind of fear and this uncertainty around communism, and who's a Communist--
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 2: --it lingered even though, I, I was largely unaware of it growing up.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean, we (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I mean, I knew (unclear) saw on TV, but.
Speaker 1: --I, I, I was aware of it.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, you know, because you heard the whispering, you heard the whispering about somebody losing a job, you heard the whispering about somebody hanging himself in the desert.  I mean, these were the kind of--I mean, I'm a little kid.  So, you know, even in Los Angeles, I think the interesting thing was that you, the, the, the--(pause) this was a country which hadn't, you know, it was, it was still dangerous, dangerous for race--people we knew who had been, you know, interred during World War II [WWII]--dangerous for national origin, dangerous for what you believed, and, you know, dangerous for who you were in your identity.  I mean, you know, the, because we grew up around people who were from the entertainment business, you knew people whose sexual orientation would, if that had been exposed would have put them in trouble.  So, there was, you know, it was--Los Angeles was a more urbane and forgiving community, but it was still, still part of an America which was, you know, the world of, of 'Leave It to Beaver' was not embracing of people of diverse backgrounds.
Story_ID: 667931
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about your siblings--
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: --before we move on to your, your life.  (Laughter) Now, we'll eventually get to you, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: --can you name your siblings and tell, tell, tell us where you fall in the order.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so--
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about 'em.
Speaker 2: --so my older, oldest sibling, Michele, M-I-C-H-E-L-E, Leslie Lomax, L-E-S-L-I-E [Michele Lomax], born in 1944, so three years older than I was.  Beautiful, creative, talented, very emotionally fragile.  As I told you she wrote a wonderful column [The Younger Side (ph.)].  She, she was never a happy kid.  Ran away from home--(laughter) I remember in elementary school [Arlington Heights Elementary School, Los Angeles, California], she ran away to go live with Jane Russell.  That was her thing, she wanted to go (laughter) she, she was, she thought my mother [Almena Lomax] was too confining, she wanted to go live with Jane Russell.  Jane Russell's who's, you know, in, you know 'How to Marry a Millionaire' [sic.] you know, something like that (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Did she know, know Jane Russell?
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no, she just liked her movies, you know, those were--she wanted--.  And but because, you know, we owned the newspaper [Los Angeles Tribune] she also got to go to the Academy Awards [Oscars] and stuff like that.  So, Michele was probably way ahead of her time.  But beautiful, intelligent, creative, you know, her idea of the, what life could hold: she wanted to, she wanted to have a, be a debutante with The Links [The Links, Incorporated]; and then, you know, after Jackie Kennedy [Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis] became first lady she thought that was, you know, 'cause she loved--my older sister loved to read, you know, Harper's Bazaar and Glamour and Vogue and those were all those--but she was very, she was very literary but died in her early forties, a schizophrenic.  So, and I think tragically traumatized by what we haven't talked about yet and that is my family's trips to the South after my mother went to cover the bus boycott [Montgomery Bus Boycott].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, I'm, I'm born in 1947 so I'm number two, first, you know, second child but oldest boy.  Next is Melanie Elizabeth Lomax, M-E-L-A-N-I-E, Elizabeth, E-L-I-Z-A-B-E-T-H, Lomax [Melanie Lomax].  Fierce advocate, becomes a lawyer, works for social justice issues, head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in Los Angeles [California], runs the police commission for Tom Bradley, fires Daryl Gates, is on the airport commission--very public, active life, and died a decade ago in an automobile accident.  After Melanie it's Mia, M-I-A, Deignan, D-E-I-G-N-A-N, Lomax [Mia Lomax].  Like my sister Melanie, went to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California], got a master's degree in history, has lived a quiet life.  She was my mother's caregiver up until her death a decade ago so.
Speaker 1: Does she teach or anything?
Speaker 2: No, she's----just, lives quietly at home.  And Mia was followed by Mark Walter Lomax, M-A-R-K, Walter, W-A-L-T-E-R [Mark Lomax], who was again born in the '50s [1950s] about ten years younger than I am, if not a little bit younger, I can't remember--there's too many people to remember all their ages.  And he's, you know, a, a lawyer in Los Angeles and the family genealogist, single.  And then my youngest brother, Lucius, L-U-C-I-U-S, Walter Lomax [Lucius Lomax], a, both a writer, journalist; has worked for a number of newspapers and Texas Monthly, and every now and then I'll see something new.  But has, his career has been as a pediatric nurse and he does that in both domestically but I think he's also done it with soldiers with, I mean, with--soldiers without, what is it?  Doctors Without Borders [Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders]--I was gonna call it soldiers without borders, so he's also done it in fairly challenging environments as well.
Speaker 1: Has he, has he been to like a Desert Storm [Operation Desert Storm] or Iraq [Iraq War] or anything like that?
Speaker 2: It's, never, you never know where, I mean, he's never, he's, he's, first of all, he's never done military but he shows up, you know, you hear, you haven't seen him for a couple of years and he's been living in the Middle East.  He's, I mean, he's, I don't understand it, but he's always some place out of the country.
Speaker 1: So, would he have been in Haiti during, after the earthquake or something?
Speaker 2: He would have, I, I don't know about Haiti but he's spent a lot of time in South and Central America--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as well.
Story_ID: 667932
Speaker 1: Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember--I do, yeah, I do have very early childhood memories.  I was born in a neighborhood called Jefferson Park, which is where a lot of the people from the Mississippi Gulf Coast lived in Los Angeles [California], right off Jefferson Boulevard.  And the, the Tribune [Los Angeles Tribune] at this point is, you know, maybe six or seven blocks away.  But we lived right behind the trolley barn and this is something most people (laughter) don't know what that is.  But Los Angeles had trolleys in the '40s [1940s] and so the, the, the trolley barn was where the, the trolley would turn around and go back up its, up Jefferson to downtown.  And I remember that trolley barn as my earliest memory, and I had to have been around three years old.  And, and I remember, you know, so this is, you know, like, so two or three years old in 1949, 1950.  It was a wonderful little neighborhood.  Our next door neighbors were named Hunami [ph.], they were Japanese and they had at this point, you know, come back from internment camps.  The other side were the Kims, K-I-M, so it's Korean family.  But there were black and white Japanese and Korean, and some Latino people; so, it was a very richly diverse community.  And I remember you, you, my parents [Almena Lomax and Lucius Lomax] gave me a, a metal horse that if you got on it and you pushed down on it, it would actually move so I would get on my horse and ride all the way down the street.  And this was before--and there was one TV at the end of the street, a little girl named Debra [ph.], her family had a TV; we didn't have one.  I could go there and watch 'Howdy Doody' ['The Howdy Doody Show'], you know, and watch Lamb Chops [sic. Lamb Chop].  So, I mean, you know, so this was a different world.  So, that's the, those are my earliest memories of living on 11th Avenue in Jefferson Park, off of Jefferson in the early 1950s, in what was even then a fairly diverse little community.
Story_ID: 667933
Speaker 1: Can you describe what it looked like; and what were some of the sights, and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, the, the, it was single family detached housing, bungalow style, most of them wood frame.  The house we had was a little wood framer probably, you know, living room, dining room, two bedrooms and a kitchen.  But it also had, and this was the bizarre thing about that house, it did have a maid's quarters, (gesture) go figure, or, or a mother-in-law's house or something so there was another, there was another--and, and because my mother [Almena Lomax] and father [Lucius Lomax] owned a newspaper [Los Angeles Tribune] and they were rich, (laughter) we actually had housekeepers who lived in it and that was a feature of much of my early life which was that because my mother was so much of a writer we had a lot of housekeepers and people who, you know, did the parenting that she couldn't do.  The, so, you know, it's a neighborhood full of these really big old (unclear) cars, that, you know, the '40s [1940s] version of big cars; a lot of trees, concrete sidewalks, it was a real feature of Los Angeles [California]: sidewalks that encouraged people to walk; you know, an alley along the side, the, the trolley barn, you know, a Safeway [Safeway Inc.] across the street from that, I mean, so there's a commercial area but inside it was really residential.  And, you know, you would walk--it was, you knew your neighbors so I'd walk down the street and see one couple that never had, didn't have any kids and they, I could get a meal in there, I mean, (unclear) you know, you could have, have lunch with them or then another couple across the street which, who had older kids the Neals [ph.], who one son became a dentist.  I mean, it's just, the, I, I, I wouldn't say I, that you, that I remember smells as much as sights, you know, because Los Angeles--greens, green grass, and a lot of bougainvillea, and a lot of, a lot of beautiful plants that were just a part of the neighborhood [Jefferson Park, Los Angeles, California].
Story_ID: 667934
Speaker 1: The next house we lived in, which was where I, where I would say the tastes are, are, you really, I felt the tastes--we moved, 'cause once my youngest si- once Melanie [Melanie Lomax] was born the house was too small.  So we moved to 6th Avenue, which is probably, which, which wasn't off of Jefferson [Boulevard] it was off between Adams [Boulevard] and Washington [Boulevard], bounded by Crenshaw [Boulevard] and Western [Avenue]; so it was a, and, and it wasn't, we weren't in Jefferson Park [Los Angeles, California] anymore, we were in the Adams hills [West Adams Heights, Los Angeles, California].  And this was a, a, the houses were bigger, we had three bedrooms in this house and one and a half baths, but we also had--
Speaker 2: Two story house?
Speaker 1: Two story house.  And we also had in this one, you know, a two stor- two car garage and next to that another maid's quarters.  And, you know, it was a bigger house, and--but it was, also had fruit trees and this is the difference.  The neighborhood was just, I mean, it was a cornucopia of fruit trees.  So, we had probably one, two, three peach trees, we had a pomegranate right next door leaning over into our yard so you could pick pomegranates off of it; a fig tree, which I hated; we had, what do you make guacamole out of?  Avocadoes.  You had, you know, you had lemons, you had limes.  But that's when I learned to ride a bicycle.  And I'd get on my bicycle and we knew where the apricot trees were, we knew where the, where the plum trees were, and you would go and raid people's backyards and get on your bikes and ride away.  And that was probably the healthiest eating I did between the ages of about (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) I was thinking that most kids would rather go to the--yeah.
Speaker 1: I mean, there's all the, I mean, you just had----I mean, there's, and I 'til this day, I mean, fruit stolen off of somebody's tree is like (gesture), you know, it's just the best in the world.  And, and that was, that was an element of Los Angeles [California], I mean, that, I think, was before, you know, people think about gangs and all that kind of stuff but the '50s [1950s] was this moment, this decade of kind of suspended differently from what it is, what it became.  And the neighborhoods were, were integrated, although there was white flight; but gee whiz it was, the fruit trees alone were enough to make it seem like something very special.
Speaker 2: It, it sounds--I'm reminded of the way Walter Mosley describes the neighborhoods in his Easy Rawlins novels, you know--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --you know in?
Speaker 1: Well, and, you know, let me just say this about Easy Rawlins.  So, you know, that, that first novel where he, it's, I think, it's set in the '40s [1940s], one of 'em is set in the '40s [1940s].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That is the L.A. I know, I knew.  I mean, and in--
Speaker 2: 'Devil in the Blue Dress' [sic. 'Devil in a Blue Dress']?
Speaker 1: 'Devil in the Blue Dress.'  And, and just like the, the one the--what's the, the, the Ellroy [James Ellroy] novel, 'The Black Dahlia.'
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: A lot of these novels that were set in L.A. in the '40s [1940s] and Central Avenue and all, that's all my grandfather's world.  And, in fact, I think, my [paternal] grandfather [Lucius Lomax, Jr.] was a character in a lot of those.  But, but the '50s [1950s] stuff, you know, it's, there is a kind of idealism about it, but it's, because it's Los Angeles there's a shady violence which is, lurks on the other side of it.
Story_ID: 667935
Speaker 1: Where did you go to school?  Where did you start school?
Speaker 2: So, my first elementary school was Arlington Heights Elementary [Arlington Heights Elementary School, Los Angeles, California], which was off of Washington [Boulevard], you know, within walking distance of our home on 6th Avenue.  And then--
Speaker 1: Was it, what was the demographics of the school?
Speaker 2: So, when I got there, so I started in probably, I guess, '52 [1952], it was white, Japanese, a little Korean as you got deeper into the '50s [1950s] because of the Korean War.
Speaker 1: Right, more Koreans.
Speaker 2: More of them.  And maybe one or two Mexican Americans, but, but Negroes, obviously.  And it was an, so it was a, a neighborhood which was--Adams hills [West Adams Heights, Los Angeles, California], which was becoming black middle class, so whites were there at the beginning.  And (laughter) I remember in elementary school, you know, kids that you would play with in your kindergarten or first grade class or second grade class who lived near the school, it wasn't that they didn't wanna play with you after school but like their grandparents particularly didn't want you, didn't want you to be--didn't want them to associate with you.  And, I think, you know, but people were, it was a range of--I mean, one, one of the really, I think, phenomenal qualities of the community was really the, the Japanese who lived in it because you would get multi generations of Japanese in the same house.  So, we had a beautiful little house that had been built by a Japanese couple across the street from us and it was built as a Japanese home.  So, you know, it had a, a pond in the backyard and it's, the sliding doors but it had an older, an older couple in it as well and so the, the older--so the grandmother wore a kimono and when she and her husband walked down the street she walked ten paces behind him, she never walked with him.  I mean, so you were seeing something--and that's just another thing about it, I mean, I mean, the, the, the rag man who came through the neighborhood came in a horse--1950s, horse drawn; there was somebody selling brooms, there was somebody who would come through the neighborhood selling (background noise), you know, clothing for the, well, it was really aprons.  You know, so, I mean, it was, there was a, there was an old southern quality to Los Angeles [California] at the same time that you had, you know, the, the ice cream truck that was a truck or the Helms Bakery that was a bakery truck that would come through every day.  And so, it was racially mixed.  And Woody Strode lived down the street from us.
Speaker 1: Oh, now Woody Strode, now he, he was a former (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Woody Strode, now, now, so Woody Strode, bad g- bald, African American actor.
Speaker 1: He was an athlete at UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California], right?  Big--All American (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but Woody Strode was my mother's [Almena Lomax] age.  I, I think, they may have gone to high school together.  And he, he lived not far away.  And hi- I remember his wife [Luukialuana Kalaeloa Strode] was either Hawaiian or something, it was, so they were exotic.  I remember one of the closest friends we had was a couple name McCoo who came to Los Angeles in the '50s [1950s] from Columbus, Georgia--Dr. Wayman [Wayman McCoo] and Dr. Mary McCoo [Mary Ellen Holloway McCoo], both of them were physicians.  Dr. McCoo--Wayman's father [Thomas McCoo] was a doctor in Eufaula [Alabama] right across the Chattahoochee River from Columbus.  But he had been head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and they threatened to kill him and so they had to relocate.  So, the McCoos moved and they had three daughters: Glenda [Glenda McCoo Wina], Marilyn [HistoryMaker Marilyn McCoo], and Mildred [Mildred McCoo], and a son, Wayman Bitsy [Wayman McCoo, Jr.] who is my contemporary.  And, and the older girls became friends of my older sister [Michele Lomax].  And, of course, Marilyn becomes The 5th Dimension.  They lived in the neighborhood.  I remember--what's the, the black woman's name in 'Star Trek'?
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Nichelle Nichols.
Speaker 2: Nichelle, she lived down the street in a, I, but this was before 'Star Trek' (laughter) I mean, she was a struggling artist, you know.  So, there were, it was really an interesting, it was an inter- it was an interesting neighborhood.  And I could get on my bicycle and not only go, you know, steal plums and apricots out of people's backyards but I could ride down Adams [Boulevard] to my [paternal] grandfather's [Lucius Lomax, Jr.] home or I could ride down to 29th Street to my [paternal] grandmother's [Minnie Deignan Lomax] home or I could deliver copy on my bike to the Tribune [Los Angeles Tribune].  So, I mean it was a--so I--so, that's, that's L.A. in the '50s [1950s].
Story_ID: 667936
Speaker 1: Graduated from elementary school [Arlington Heights Elementary School, Los Angeles, California], which by the way had only white teachers, they had two black teachers--two black male teachers, I never had a black, I never got one of those teachers; in elementary school, no black female teachers, all my teachers were white.
Speaker 2: Did you like school?  I assume you did, but (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I was a very good student, I was a good--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --I read a lot, and all that kind of thing.  Then I go right across, right next to it is a, is a junior high, then called Mount Vernon, and now it's Johnnie Cochran Middle School [Johnnie L. Cochran, Jr. Middle School], but Mount Vernon Junior High School [Los Angeles, California].  I went there for, from 1960--1959 to 1962 was when I graduated.  But in the middle of that--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in 1961, my mother [Almena Lomax] shuts down the newspaper [Los Angeles Tribune] and starts going south to cover civil rights and--
Speaker 2: Now she first traveled in '56 [1956], is that it?
Speaker 1: Now, but she, she first traveled, in '56 [1956] she went for a week to cover the Civil Rights Movement, but by '61 [1961] the Civil Rights Movement is getting more intense, you know, this is, you know--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you know, it's gonna be, you're gonna have the Birmingham movement [Birmingham, Alabama], you're gonna have Selma [Selma to Montgomery March]; you're gonna have all kinds of stuff.  And she wants to go back but she doesn't wanna just cover it, she wants to live there, so (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this is--did your parents divorce before she--?
Speaker 1: My parents were divorced at this stage.   My fa--
Speaker 2: So, did you, you know that there, there was, there was tension, as a kid?  Now you would have been--
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I mean, I grew up in the house.  Yeah, I mean, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm just?
Speaker 1: I mean, my parents were not, they actually weren't really, they--so there are six kids, my mother decides that she doesn't wanna be married anymore.  She sort of announces it to us and to my father [Lucius Lomax].  My father, I think, was not pleased with it but, you know, soon, sooner or later, my mother was pretty determined, he moved out, you know, he moved out.  And I actually lived with him for the, for a fair amount of time.  It was--'cause it was a lot quieter living with him than with living with five brothers and sisters, and I got a lot more attention.  But so he moved out.  For a while he continued to have an ownership in the newspaper, but he sold that to my mother.  And he started, went into the real estate business and, and went to night school and got a law degree and became a lawyer.  So, he just changed his life all together.  While my mother was--you know, she, she, I think, she thought that she could still be a powerful force in the community even though she no longer had a newspaper; once she got out of the newspaper business all the people who didn't like her and she'd written about badly, you know, turned against her and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) So, she didn't maintain it after he sold it to her?
Speaker 1: No, she kept it, but by '60 [1960], at, at the end of 1960 she just had enough of it, she wanted to, to become a freelancer and write for, about the South for, for others.

Speaker 1: So, in January of 1961 we moved to Tuskegee, Alabama.  As a, you know, how traumatically different can it be.  I, so I leave Mount Vernon Junior High [Mount Vernon Junior High School, Los Angeles, California] and go to Tuskegee, think I'm leaving for good, you know.  And the trip was a mess.  We, our car broke down in Blythe, California.  We had to take a bus, Greyhound bus from the California border to Alabama, which meant that was our first encounter with segregation.  We almost get arrested trying to eat in a white--
Speaker 2: Now, at what point on the trip did they make you sit in the back or try to get you (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Once we got to Texas.  And once we got to Texas, and I remember we got to a place called Big Springs, Texas [sic. Big Spring, Texas], I don't know where it is, but I know--mother [Almena Lomax] said, "I--this is interstate commerce and I refuse to go to the Negro section, this is against the law."  Well, let me just tell you, they called the state troopers and we didn't get anything to eat that, on that stop; we got in the back and we were in the back of the bus from then on, from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Now this is--just for the sake of history, this is before the--
Speaker 1: We were--Freedom Rides.
Speaker 2: --Freedom Rides.
Speaker 1: Yes, this was nine--
Speaker 2: This was a couple of months before the Freedom--?
Speaker 1: January of 1961.
Speaker 2: Right.  It's at least four or five months before.
Speaker 1: Yes, I know, and let me just say, and if you don't believe me you just read the June issue [sic.] of The Nation and read 'Journey to the Beginning' ['Journey to the Beginning: A Northern Negro Moves to Dixie'] by Almena Lomax, and it's all documented in there.
Speaker 2: No, I believe you, I'm just saying--I'm just saying this before the--
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, well, I know, I mean, I know and we--
Speaker 2: I know a lot of people tried it before.
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we were, I mean, but, you know, and we, I think, that was--even my mother had to realize that she couldn't put her children at risk.  So, you know, once we, then we conformed all the way to Alabama.
Story_ID: 667938
Speaker 1: And we get to Tuskegee [Alabama], spend the first couple of nights in what was the guest facilities at Tuskegee Institute [Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama] called Dorothy Hall, so it was my first time on a black college campus [HBCU] was Tuskegee Institute, 1961.  And we get enrolled--once our furniture gets there we get a little house, we get enrolled in Lewis Adams Elementary School [Tuskegee, Alabama] for my brother, little brothers and sisters and my older sister [Michele Lomax] and I are at Tuskegee Institute High School [Tuskegee, Alabama], where as I tell people the janitor rode to school on a mule that grazed out in front of the building.  I went, had classmates who were, you know, the sons and daughters of sharecroppers; and, you know, it was potbellied stove, and, you know, just a culture (laughter) that I didn't understand.  I'm urbane Los Angeles [California], I got teachers who said, you know, when the first rocket went up, you know, if, if Lord had meant people to fly he'd have given 'em wings, you know.  So, I mean, the, so there were cultural, but I had the greatest time of my life.  We lived there for six months until, until June.  Wonderful, warm, embracing community.  Also a very sophisticated one because as much as there was real poverty and people who were sharecroppers, there was a private hospital in Tuskegee, Joseph Andrews [sic. John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital], and a veterans hospital [Tuskegee Veterans Administration Medical Center; Central Alabama Veterans Health Care System East Campus, Tuskegee, Alabama]; so more black doctors than you probably knew.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the Dibble, Eugene Dibble [Eugene H. Dibble, Jr.] was there, right?
Speaker 1: Yeah, all those people were there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: I'll tell you who else was there was, what's her name, oh, gosh, my brain and I'm embarrassed, marries the black, marries the Black Panther [Black Panther Party], what's her name?  Gosh.
Speaker 2: Oh, somebody that married a Black--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, and she becomes, oh--'Soul On Ice,' Eldridge Cleaver?  Kathleen.
Speaker 2: Oh, Kathleen Cleaver?
Speaker 1: We got Kathleen Cleaver living there, yeah, man, I know which house she lived in; and their parents [Pearl Johnson Neal and Ernest E. Neal] were former diplomats--I mean, so there was a, there was a range of people.  I mean, she came from a very privileged background.  But--
Speaker 2: Okay.  What was her maiden name?
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I (unclear).
Speaker 1: But, you know, but she was, her parents were highly educated.  I think, former members of--worked in foreign service or something.  So, there was this, you know, this real range of people, but it was a wonderful community and we spent six months there.
Story_ID: 667939
Speaker 1: The only reason we, we left [Tuskegee, Alabama] in June of '61 [1961] was my grandfather died.  He had been in, having, he was in the terminal stages of cancer when we left and he shot himself.  He committed suicide at the end.  He was, you know, he was living in this big house, had his own nurse and all that kind of stuff but he got one of those guns and blew his brains out 'cause it was getting too rough.
Speaker 2: So this is Lucius Lomax, Sr. [sic. Lucius Lomax, Jr.]?
Speaker 1: Lucius Lomax, Sr.  The--and, and, and we left because he had left a lot of money to my brothers and sisters and me.  So, (laughter) my mother [Almena Lomax] said, "I can, you know, I, let's go back and get the benefit of this," but lo and behold what she didn't realize was grandfather had created trust funds for all of us that we couldn't get until we were thirty years old, and my parents could have no access to it.  So, we were--my father [Lucius Lomax] did inherit 'cause, you know, he inherited stuff but, you know, didn't inherit the bulk of the estate; the grandchildren inherited the bulk of the estate.  The really, the person who inherited the bulk of the estate was the, was his secretary who he had bought a piece of real estate with in joint tenancy, and the piece of real estate was a hill in Laguna so she was the one who got most of the estate.  But so we all, we all had--from that point on we had trust funds.
Story_ID: 667940
Speaker 1: You said your father [Lucius Lomax] basically had to take care of you at that point (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Hm?
Speaker 1: Did, did your mother [Almena Lomax], was she still able to provide for you?
Speaker 2: No, well--
Speaker 1: Or, well, I, I guess, they were sharing that responsibility, right?
Speaker 2: So, no, my mother had, my mother had, as it turned out she had guardianship of all the student- all the kids except me.  And I didn't know it, but I had been awarded to my dad.  They, and, and we never knew it 'cause she wouldn't let me stay with him, when--if she got angry she would make me come home.  But so, but anyway, so we come back and between '62 [1962] and '64 [1964] she makes at least one more trip south, I refuse to go, so I stay in Los Angeles [California] and stay with my dad, and everybody else went.  She made two more trips.  She made one where all of the others went I think to Albany, Georgia of all places.  And then another one where Michele [Michele Lomax] refused to go, so I was, she and--Michele and I stayed with my dad.  But she would take everybody out of school and go cover a big story in the South and then, you know, stay months or weeks and, and come back.  It was very disruptive, very traumatizing.
Speaker 1: Did she go to Birmingham [Alabama]?
Speaker 2: So, she, she did all that and then even she kind of came to the conclusion this was not good for the kids.  So she, she came back, she got a job working for the Los Angeles Herald Dispatch which was another small black weekly newspaper, closely associated with the Black Muslims.  The people who owned it were big sympathizers with the Black Muslims, and mother did a lot of writing about the Muslims in Los Angeles during that period, from '62 [1962] to '64 [1964].  And bought a home--see but it was at least stable, we, she bought a home, we lived in the, yeah, we, we, we had another home to live in.  I spent a lot of time, you know, back and forth with my dad but--up until my junior year of high school [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California].  And then in 1964 she decided she wanted to go back south.  Now, you think about the summer of '64 [1964], this is--yeah.
Speaker 1: Right.  That's Freedom Summer they call it.
Speaker 2: Freedom Summer.  So, she says, "And it's Freedom Summer; we're going back to Alabama."  And I said I'm not going.  And she really pressured and pressured and finally she said, "If you will go," she used a bribe at the end, "if you will go I'll send you to, to prep school."  And she didn't get me into prep school but she did get me into Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  So, I didn't finish high school, but I went to Morehouse as a freshman.
Story_ID: 667941
Speaker 1: So you didn't finish high school at all, you didn't (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, unh-uh.  I went to--I was sixteen [years old], I went to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  They went to Tuskegee [Alabama].  They lasted maybe four or five months, I lasted a lifetime (laughter), I never went back to California.  And I, obviously, I finished Morehouse, but there was one more trip south, they came to Atlanta [Georgia], it didn't last for very long, and they moved back to California in about, and, and that, this was in--so the only time I spent in California again was the summer of '65 [1965] after my freshmen year at Morehouse which was summer of '65 [1965]: the first Watts riot.  So, we're living on Adams Boulevard, which is, you know, distant from Watts [Los Angeles, California].  My father's law office is on Central Avenue right across the street from the Dunbar [Dunbar Hotel, Los Angeles, California].  Watts riot, dad [Lucius Lomax] puts up Negro owned on it, so it doesn't get touched.  But, you know, that Monday morning when I, I have a job that Tom Bradley got me working at the gas company as a little administrative assistant, get up to take the bus to, to work downtown and there are tanks with National Guardsmen; and, and that was, that was my summer of '65 [1965].  We go back south one more time, mother [Almena Lomax] is--I'm at Morehouse, sophomore at Morehouse, mother is gonna move to Atlanta, she's gonna make Atlanta home.  That doesn't last but about three months or so, next thing I know they've packed up and gone back to Los Angeles [California].  And I spent no more than two weeks in Los Angeles after that in any given year.  I--sophomore year, I got a job at the, that summer at The Washington Post as an intern.
Story_ID: 667942
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna backtrack some--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --before we get you that far.  Just backtrack to what your interests were as you were coming (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --along.  I, I take it you were interested in writing, you were reading and writing, in--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you first, did you ever write any articles for your mother's--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --paper [Los Angeles Tribune] (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  So, you know, I don't know how this happened.  My life growing up was pretty chaotic, you know.  Even when my parents were married, the newspaper was all consuming and, you know, and my mother [Almena Lomax] kept having kids (laughter) so she's having all these babies, six kids, but they kept it together.  I mean, we, we always had a, we always had a live in housekeeper.  My, as long as my grandmothers were alive and I think this was--well, as long as my grandparents were alive there was a real sort of security.  But my father's mother dies in 1959, his father [Lucius Lomax, Jr.] dies in '61 [1961], her mother [Geneva Marx Davis] dies in '64 [sic. 1962]; and those paren- I really realized how much they kind of helped hold it all together.
Speaker 1: You, you said off camera, you were telling me about Maulana Karenga's brother, Cheston--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Everett eulogizing your grandmother (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean, Minnie [Minnie Deignan Lomax] was this----so, so yeah, so, so Cheston Everett was the art and drama critic and his brother, Maulana Ron Karenga [HistoryMaker Maulana Karenga], you know, who starts Kwanzaa who was, I knew as Ron Everett [Ronald Everett] would--his younger brother would bring his column once a week to the house so mother could, you know, get it and review it and then put it in the newspaper.  He was a very elegant, you know, dapper, kind of guy.  But my grandmother Minnie, who had raised my dad [Lucius Lomax], who was the, you know, the first college and university graduate, you know, (gesture) that I, who, and whose line I follow, she, her columns, and then she, so she would write these weekly columns in addition to her book reviews.  And her weekly columns began with her philosophy of life (laughter); and then she would, and then they were the society: who was in town visiting whom, who had a tea, who had a--this.  And I used to go to those things with Minnie 'cause my father refused to go with her so I was always her, you know, well dressed escort to these events.  So, I was seeing how the elite Negro community of Los Angeles [California] lived.
Story_ID: 667943
Speaker 1: My aunt, Gwendolyn [Gwendolyn Davis Collier], my mother's [Almena Lomax] younger sister, at some point while I was in elementary school [Arlington Heights Elementary School, Los Angeles, California] did something really quite remarkable.  She joined a book club for me, and I started getting monthly a novel or a history written for, you know, kids my age; and I started reading books.  And I think that in spite of the kind of chaos of, you know, living with a bunch of brothers and sisters 'cause that's always chaotic, six kids, but ultimately all those trips south, literature became really important for me and it came, became a kind of an escape.  So, I was a reasonably good student across the board, but I was a very good student in literature and history and language.  So, that became sort of my area of specialization.  I wasn't a big athlete, I was--but I was a good swimmer and that made a difference in Los Angeles [California].  And I built a little world of my own, you know, and much of it was in books and in performing well academically.  And, and I was never happy in the chaos of a big family.  I, I spent a lot of time--I would rather have, and I did this, I would rather have been alone at my father's [Lucius Lomax] house while he was in school or off on a date or something like that and being able to do my homework and have a structured life than being (laughter) around the chaos that oh, I thought of growing up.  And, and so, you know, I mean, so it's a terrible, it's a terrible choice to have to make.
Story_ID: 667944
Speaker 1: I was able to--and I, I was very goal oriented.  I mean, I knew that I wanted to get a good education, I wanted to go to college.  I was, I always thought I would go to an Ivy League school.  I used to--for some reason in the, the, get, in the early '60s [1960s] I was getting the Brown catalog, I don't know why Brown [Brown University] was the one I wanted to go to, in Providence, Rhode Island, but I loved the pictures of what the campus looked like with snow.  It just seemed like, you know, this was--this is the way college is supposed to be.  So, in '64 [1964] when mother [Almena Lomax] convinces me that she'll put, get me in preparatory school and I was admitted to Palmer Institute [Alice Freeman Palmer Memorial Institute] in Sedalia, North Carolina, and thank--and I was admitted to three schools: Palmer; I was admitted early admission to Fisk [Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee] where my [paternal] grandmother [Minnie Deignan Lomax] had gone to college; and I was admitted to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I don't know what made us, made me decide that of the three I would take Morehouse, but I did and it made all the difference.
Speaker 2: Did it have anything to do with doc- did, did you know anything about Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] at that (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, it's, although Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] was the reason--so mother had, knew Dr. Mays and so she wrote to Dr. Mays and said, you know, "Do you have--," 'cause she thought they had an academy, she thought they had a program for, he said, "No, but we do admit ten students every year who haven't finished high school who are very good academically. Send me his transcript."  So, she sends the transcript and he said, "Well, he seems, he meets my standards," and he admitted me, he admitted me, he gave me a full tuition scholarship.
Speaker 2: Now that's the way it should be--I--you know (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, well, that so, I mean--I, I mean, so Dr. Mays admitted me to Morehouse.  And--
Speaker 2: Yeah Dr. King started school at sixteen [years old].
Speaker 1: Yeah, he, no, he started at--yeah, at sixteen; and Maynard at fourteen--Maynard Jackson.  So, so, I got in and, you know, what I will say is, it wasn't Brown, the campus didn't look like the photographs in, in the book, but I, I, I--at sixteen years old I was always number one in my class until graduation.
Story_ID: 667945
Speaker 1: You're gonna ask me about Buck Benny.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  Buck Benny is a name that people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 2: --use to refer to--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --Dr. Benjamin Mays.  That's what, that's an affectionate name.
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, look, Dr. Mays was to education what Nelson Mandela was to South Africa.  I mean, I, I always thought that the two people in my lifetime who looked absolutely like they were supposed to perform the role that they were in, the two most elegant black men I ever encountered and met were Benjamin E. Mays and Nelson Mandela.  And I can say I met 'em both, you know, and they both looked the part.  Dr. Mays would stride across the campus [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], his, his residence was near the freshman dorm, Graves Hall, and his office was in Harkness Hall, maybe a block away.  And he would stride across the campus, he had the coolest suits, he was always dressed immaculately, he was, he was just incredible visually.  And then when he got up there in chapel and spoke he was charming, he was witty, and he was profoundly moral and spiritual.  And, (pause) and it's hard to believe that this man came from Ninety Six, South Carolina, that he was, you know, the son of sharecroppers [Louvenia Carter Mays and Hezekiah Mays].  They did (laughter) probably very intense manual labor growing up.  He had a mind and an education that was second to none.  But he was also just such a generous person; and he was a great schoolmaster, he was a great leader of a men's school because he had a lot of tolerance for the idiocy of young men.
Story_ID: 667946
Speaker 1: You know I remember, you know, so I get admitted to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] at the age of sixteen and I'm from Los Angeles [California] and I'm surrounded by all these southerners and I can't beli- I'm the only kid from L.A.  So, the first thing that happens to me is I get adopted by a group of guys from Durham [North Carolina], there were about four of them in the dorm and they kind of take pity on me and they kind of start looking out for me so the Durham guys look, look after me.  Because, you know, you walk on the campus, you had to wear a beanie; somebody said, you know, "Can you go, you know, you know, get this light bulb out for me?" I mean, all kinds of, you know, screwy things they would tell you to do.
Speaker 2: Now, these things, that's, these, these things sound like they're from Mars now.
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do, but, you know, so, so--
Speaker 2: Freshmen actually wore beanies?
Speaker 1: Freshmen wore beanies, you were hazed.  And, you know, I was very overwhelmed, but I was always polite, yes sir, no sir, and but I did develop pretty quickly a reputation as a very good student so that stood me a little bit of stead.  But I remember, so the, sort of the freshman year event which sealed my reputation as not being particularly conventional was that at Morehouse you spent, you were in the chapel every day.  And, you know, you had great speakers, you know, I mean, probably the greatest of all was Howard Thurman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) And I remember after the first week when Howard Thurman had been there, during religious emphasis week and Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] strolls into the Sale Hall chapel, which is on the second floor of, of Sale Hall.  I'm sitting up in the crow's nest, the second balcony, the balcony, and Dr. Mays says, you know, "We've just had religious emphasis week and does anyone have ideas for religious emphasis, next week, next year?"  And so, nobody was supposed to respond.  So, I raised my hand (laughter) in the balcony and I say--"Yes, young man," he says.  And so, so I say, "Well, Dr. Mays, you know, I think we emphasize religion too much around this place, so I think next year we should have a religious de-emphasis week."  Well--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --(laughter) silence.
Speaker 2: This is a sixteen inch softball that you pitched up to him.
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, Dr. Mays, so, you know, and I was from then on known as the outspoken freshman.  But, you know, I was, I was making really good grades, I was number one in my class which I remained--I was the first group of Phi Beta Kappas inducted into Phi Beta Kappa [Phi Beta Kappa Society] at Morehouse (laughter) (unclear).  And the only reason I graduated number two in the class was the guy who graduated number one had started Morehouse at fourteen, had gone off to Europe for a year so he came back and he graduated with our class and he was number one in the class.  I went to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York], he went to Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut]; he became a professor of philosophy at Duke [Duke University, Durham, North Carolina]--Benjamin Ward, now deceased.  I mean, it was an incredible--
Speaker 2: Let me, well--
Speaker 1: --learning experience.
Speaker 2: Now, you weren't raised in a religious household at all, right?
Speaker 1: No, I, well, I, I, well, no, my parents [Almena Lomax and Lucius Lomax] sent me to church every Sunday.  I went, I was a Congregationalist.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: But they sent me to a Congregationalist church, I mean, I, they, so, we're--you know.
Speaker 2: What is the difference, some of us don't know.
Speaker 1: Well, Congregationalists, I mean, you sing off key in Congregationalist church, nobody claps, nobody says amen except at the end of a prayer.  You know, they're, it's a very low church sort of, I mean, you know, not a lot of ritual and stuff, very--in Protestant denomination but very progressive, you know, but socially aware.  And so--
Speaker 2: Right.  A lot of abolitionist activity in the 19th century (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, but and then activism, you know, antiwar activism and stuff like that.  So, I will, I grew up in a religious environment.  My grandparent- my grandmothers were, were pillars of that community although my, my, my, my father's mother [Minnie Deignan Lomax] became a Christian Scientist at the end of her life.  But, so--
Speaker 2: And so, but, but you're, what you raised at convocation is similar to some of the complaints that Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] had at Wilberforce [Wilberforce University, Wilberforce, Ohio]--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --and other people.  I mean, there were--you weren't the first.  But the--yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but, you know, but--but here's the difference: nobody kicked me out of school for saying it.  This was, this was lightweight rebellion at a time when people were leaving school to go join SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] or they were--you know, by the end of my, by my senior year, you know, the debate was between Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture] and the college minister about black power.  It was, you know, I was antiwar.  I participated in demonstrations, but I didn't leave school.
Story_ID: 667947
Speaker 1: Dr. Mays [Benjamin Mays] was close to Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: Dr. Mays and Dr.--and here's another thing, Dr. King was on campus, you know, so not only Dr. King but Coretta [Coretta Scott King] was on campus and his parents were on campus, I mean, you saw Daddy King [Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr.] and Mama King [Alberta Williams King] a lot.  His sister [HistoryMaker Christine King Farris] taught at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  The Kings were fixtures on the campus.  And whenever, by this point, the time I'm in college the Civil Rights Movement has relocated to Atlanta [Georgia] so the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC] is now in Atlanta.  So, that, so the big event my freshman year was Selma [Selma to Montgomery March], second semester of my freshman year, two big thing- you know, so that happens.  And Dr. King came on campus and, you know, would, would come on campus and both enlist students to go to the big demonstrations or to have us participate in what we call sympathy demonstrations in Atlanta.  So, when something was going on in one of those places, we would march around the federal office building; or when they refused to seat [HistoryMaker] Julian Bond we would march around the state capitol [Georgia State Capitol, Atlanta, Georgia].  But I remember them coming to get students to go to, to Selma.  And, of course, then another thing that happened was one of my classmates from Tuskegee [Tuskegee Institute High School, Tuskegee, Alabama], Sammy Younge [Sammy Younge, Jr.], gets murdered.  And so, I mean, this gets (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Now he had joined SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]?
Speaker 2: He had, and Sammy had joined SNCC.  And the last time I had seen him had been my freshman year, early in '64 [1964] he had come by to see my sister [Michele Lomax] 'cause they had been sort of romantically involved back in '61 [1961].  And he had just gotten back from the [U.S.] Navy and he joined SNCC and he challenges a white guy at the bus depot in Tuskegee [Alabama] and winds up, you know, in a pool of blood, murdered.  So, I mean, so this was a, this was--so my rebellion, you know, was pretty lightweight.  I'm doing it as a student who is gonna graduate on time.  But, of course, the other big event of my fresh- of my time at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] was that in '68 [1968] when Dr. King is assassinated, you know, his body is brought to Spelman and his funeral is on the Morehouse campus, so.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that had to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) You know, we, you, you weren't very far away from the Civil Rights Movement.
Story_ID: 667948
Speaker 1: Now you were right in the center of it, you know, of it I guess, in the sense that you were in Atlanta [Georgia] where the funeral takes place and all that.
Speaker 2: So, so--
Speaker 1: How did you find out about it and?
Speaker 2: Well, first of all, I mean, I was living on the Bennett col- the Bennett--I was living in Bennett Hall on the campus of the Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia] which is, then Bennett Hall was the residence hall for the Morehouse School of Religion [Atlanta, Georgia] and they had extra rooms and it was a newer dorm.  So you, I didn't live on the main campus, I lived over there, which was maybe three or four blocks from Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I remember watching television that evening, 'cause it was a Saturday or Sunday night, I can't remember which night it was.  News is interrupted, Dr. Mays [sic.] had been shot in Memphis [Tennessee].
Speaker 1: Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].
Speaker 2: I mean--I said Dr. Mays, I'm sorry.  Dr. King has been shot in Memphis.  And then shortly thereafter Dr. King is dead.  Pretty eerie, scary; I mean, we had been through assassinations, you know.  I was, I was at L.A. High [Los Angeles High School, Los Angeles, California] when, when somebody walks into the high, the, my civics classroom and says President Kennedy [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] has been shot.  So, you've lived this, you've been through this drill before.  And it's pretty quiet.  I don't think anything really much happened that night.  And--no burning of buildings, 'cause there was some, people said that didn't happen in, in Atlanta.  Some of that did happen.  So, you're watching the news.  The next day I went from campus, and instead of going to the campus, I went over to the West Hunter Street Baptist Church [Atlanta, Georgia], which was the church that Dr. Abernathy [Ralph Abernathy] ran, was the, it--was the pastor of.  And if, if it wasn't the next day, it was the day after I went there and a guy named Earl Graves [HistoryMaker Earl G. Graves, Sr.] who would found Black Enterprise had been sent by Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] on whose staff he served to help the King family put together a funeral for Dr. King; and the West Hunter Street Baptist Church became the nerve center for that work, and I volunteered there.  But Dr.--you know, but Dr. King's body is brought to Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia], he lay in state in Sisters Chapel.  The lines were twenty-four hours a day, people going to pay their respects.  The job I had was a kind of gofer job and one of 'em was to take people who came from around the world, well known people over to Spelman and go in through a back door at the Sisters Chapel and so they wouldn't have to wait in a long line to go pay their respects.  I took [HistoryMaker] Ruby Dee and [HistoryMaker] Ossie Davis and a filmmaker, Jules Dassin I think his name was.
Speaker 1: (Pronunciation) Dassin, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Jules Dassin, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I took him.
Speaker 1: D-A-S-S-I-N (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Among others--yeah, I mean, those, those were three that really, and it was particularly moving because in the case of Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis, I mean, the, these, they were very close to Dr. King and, you know, here you are, and, and Spel- Sisters Chapel is a beautiful setting for, for that.  But you, I mean, you looked right into the, the open casket and you see somebody I had met ten years before, you know, having ice cream and cake in my living room in Los Angeles [California]; I mean, he's thirty-nine years old, he's a young man.
Speaker 1: Yeah I would think it would make--I'm sorry, I--Jules Dassin was probably with them because they were making the movie 'Uptight.'
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: He was the producer.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, I mean, it's, so I knew, I mean, I knew who he was, I knew then he was a filmmaker.
Story_ID: 667949
Speaker 1: I have to say that by the time the funeral actually occurs--my role, I don't really have any role, I mean, there, I have a, I have classmates who were in the Glee Club [Morehouse College Glee Club] and, you know, they obviously had a major role to play.  There were so many people on that campus that it just became claustrophobic, and I went back to the dormitory [Bennett Hall] and locked myself in my room.  But I have to this day and I keep them with me always, four programs from the funeral.  My mother [Almena Lomax] came and, you know, it was like people from all over the country, you know, my mother came, she covered it, she wrote about it.  I met people who, one of the people I met, I had never met before, I knew who she was, a girl named Shirley Clarke, she became Shirley Franklin, first black mayor of--I met Shirley there.  She came down from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.].  I mean, students came, people just came from everywhere.  And I will say this, there was a little, there were a couple of white owned stores that got burned near the campus, but there was also a kind of, just a calm over the city and all those people there and really no violence; I mean, respect for Dr. King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.].  And then, you know, weeks later Bobby Kennedy [Robert F. Kennedy] is assassinated.  And then weeks later you have your graduation.  And I remember that program, I mean, there were about, there were three hundred guys in my class, a hundred graduate.  The speaker was the then president [Stephen J. Wright] of the United Negro College Fund [UNCF]--how's that for irony?  But also on the program was the chief justice of the United States Earl Warren.  Also on that program sitting on the stage is Coretta Scott King.  And, of course, the anthem sung is 'The Impossible Dream.'  I mean (gesture) it's like, you know, you, I'm, it's hard not to get emotional just thinking about that.  And in the four years that I was at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], you know, closely observing and participating a little bit in the Civil Rights Movement, the leader is murdered and martyred in your behalf, I mean, to change the world for you.  And I leave there and go on to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] to get my master's degree.  And, and confront there not the Civil Rights Movement but the antiwar movement, and the daily demonstrations and, you know, Mark Rudd from the SDS [Students for a Democratic Society] speaking and, you know, this, so the New York [New York] in the, in '69 [1969] is a completely, you know, radicalized antiwar, anti-capitalism kind of era.
Story_ID: 667950
Speaker 1: Let me go back a little bit to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I, I didn't ask you about, we talked about Benjamin Mays but who were some of the other teachers, say in the English department that--
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: --that were inspirational or--to you?
Speaker 2: So, you know, the, here's the big difference, you know, so this was the, one of the really amazing things about Morehouse obviously was getting to go to a college where there was a, there were black people with Ph.D.'s (laughter).  You know, I mean so, I, I, and they were so, I mean, you know, so just let me just--it's a small campus, it wasn't a big campus.  It, the Morehouse is one which sort of bleeds into, then bled into Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia].  Dr. Mays is the president of Morehouse.  Rufus Clement [Rufus Early Clement] who had been my father's [Lucius Lomax] roommate at Northwestern [Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois] is the president of Atlanta University.  Then across the way is Clark [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], and farther over is Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  And I immediately started taking classes at Spelman.  I did very well in my Spanish placement exam and they didn't have a Spanish class for me to take at Morehouse, so I took it at Spelman and I'm, so I'm beginning to, to--my education, not just at Morehouse, but Morehouse and Spelman.  And I'm a student of literature, a little bored at first, and, I mean, they let me take classes, sit in on classes at Atlanta University.  You know, I remember sitting in on an anthropology class there.  The library became my favorite, Trevor Arnett Library.  Julian Bond's mom was the research librarian in there.  His father--
Speaker 1: So, [HistoryMaker] Julia Bond, right?
Speaker 2: --Julia, and Horace Mann Bond would walk across the campus.  They had a, a Doberman Pinscher (laughter) and I remember they walked the Doberman.  And, you know, you, you're, you're, you're running into people who are icons and they became fast friends.  You know, and I would spend a lot of time in the library, I got privileges in the stacks.  The periodical room, there was a woman named Lillian Miles [Lillian Miles Lewis] from Los Angeles [California] who was the librarian there.  And we, so we're both from Los Angeles, she knew my family, she's dating a guy in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] named [HistoryMaker] John Lewis.  So, she marries John--you know, what I mean?  So, it was a little world, you know, I mean, you're dealing with all of these really incredible people.
Story_ID: 667951
Speaker 1: I remember my fresh- my sophomore year [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] I w- I did some acting and I quickly learned I wasn't gonna be a good actor.  But the one play that was really interesting, we did Jean Genet's 'The Blacks' ['The Blacks: A Clown Show'], which was a pretty radical piece of, of theater--absurdist theater.  And I played the Governor, which was a colonial figure.  (Laughter) And, and, but in the audience all the SNCC people [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] came to the, to see the play 'cause it was, you know, it was really out there and, you know, it had profanity in it, but the president of Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] let 'em--it was at the Spelman theater but the president of Spelman [Albert E. Manley] let us do it.  I'm in the, in, in the play, as the, the, the star of the play is a guy gamed Ken Eckstine [ph.], his father is Billy Eckstine, you know, and, I mean, it was, and we're doing 'The Blacks,' you know, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, Negro Ensemble Company [NEC] did in the '60s [1960s] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Negro Ensemble Company had done--I think Cicely [Cicely Tyson] was in it.  I think--
Speaker 2: Right, she was.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: She was.
Speaker 1: I mean, whom I, (laughter) you know, would know in later years.  Then when, and then when they did 'Macbeth' [William Shakespeare] my sophomore year or junior year, whatever it was, and I was a, I did, I was a stagehand for that, Diana Sands was Lady Macbeth.
Speaker 2: So, she was in school with you (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) No, no, no, no, no, they brought Diana Sands in for this.
Speaker 2: Oh, she--they brought her in for this, okay.  Yeah, 'cause she was older, that's right.
Speaker 1: So, so, she had done 'Raisin in the Sun' ['A Raisin in the Sun,' Lorraine Hansberry], she did this.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, of course, she died of cancer not long after that.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Story_ID: 667952
Speaker 1: You know, it wasn't just that you were having interesting teachers who were black folks with Ph.D.'s which said something to you that was about aspiration and what you could become, there were these really remarkable people in and out of the, of the environment.  The chairman of the English department was a guy named Steve Henderson who became, who came to Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] and really wrote a lot about black literature.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Stephen E. Henderson.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Stephen E. Henderson.  I was less, I wasn't interested in black literature at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia].  I was, I wanted to get, I was going to get a Ph.D. in liter- in English, not in African American--in English; they didn't talk about African American literature then.  And, you know, so I was taking a year of Milton [John Milton] and a year of Chaucer [Geoffrey Chaucer] and a year of, you know, I was taking all this stuff.  And, and I had, you know, and the, the, the woman who taught that was a, a white woman from Atlanta [Georgia] with a Ph.D. from Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], and there were no more than two or three students in every one of our classes and she worked our tails off.  And I took Latin because Morehouse had to have a Latin offering in order to get a, a Phi Beta Kappa chapter [Phi Beta Kappa Society].  And then when they got the person who would teach Latin, they had to make somebody teach it.  And I, I had a tutorial in Latin by myself for two years, you know, so I was getting this really meticulous traditional English and literature, (laughter) literary--the I, I, I actually had more American history than I had, 'cause this was in, you know, this was the '60s [1960s], they weren't teaching African American anything.  And that would only happen, my interest in African American literature would occur after I got back from Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York].
Story_ID: 667953
Speaker 1: I'm getting all this preparation, and so when I graduate, I'm admitted to--I didn't get into Yale [Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut], which I wanted to get into which was probably the best literary program.  But I got admitted into, to, to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] and to Wisconsin [University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin], I decided to go to Columbia.  And I studied 16th century nondramatic poetry, you know.  I was really in the era of, you know, the age of Shakespeare [William Shakespeare].  And at the same time, you know, I'm reading 16th century and poetry of the Restoration, those are my two areas; and I'm writing a master's thesis on a source for Shakespeare's history plays.  But all around me is all of this antiwar stuff going on.  And I'm about to get drafted and I'm getting draft counseled and we finally conclude that the only way I'm going to a stay out of the [U.S.] Army 'cause I'm a, well, I got a, my number is 125, is to get a job teaching at a historically black college [HBCU] 'cause that will get you a, an occupational deferment.  And I write back to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and I say, "I'm about to finish my master's, will you hire me?"  They hired me as an instructor of English.  And after one year at Columbia, I was back at Morehouse teaching.
Speaker 2: So, you had a one year towards a master's degree?
Speaker 1: I got my master's.
Speaker 2: Oh, you got it in that--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was, I was on a mission, man; I had to get a degree so I could teach.  And--
Speaker 2: So you--okay.  So, this is the same year 1969 you're back at--(laughter)?
Speaker 1: No, well, I--I, so, I was gone, I graduated in June of '68 [1968], I was at Columbia summer of '68 [1968], '69 [1969]; I get a, a position at Morehouse to start in the fall of '69 [1969]; and in the, and during the summer I get a job tutoring at Yale.
Story_ID: 667954
Speaker 1: It was that summer that I met a young woman from Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] who was a playwright and poet, and I fall in love and get her to agree to come south with me and to drop out of Howard: [HistoryMaker] Pearl Cleage.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Right.
Speaker 1: So--
Speaker 2: Now, she's an interesting person.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And comes from an interesting family, too.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, you should probably say something about--?
Speaker 1: Yeah, so her father was Albert Buford Cleage [Albert B. Cleage, Jr.] or otherwise known as Jaramogi Abebe Agyeman, the founder of the Shrine of the Black Madonna [Detroit, Michigan], black Christian nationalism.  But like me, I mean, their family, they were Congregationalists before that.  And oh, by the way, the same pastor I had in Los Angeles [California], Harold Kingsley [Harold M. Kingsley] who was, had been at the Church of the Good Shepherd [Church of the Good Shepherd Congregational United Church of Christ] where my parents [Almena Lomax and Lucius Lomax] went in Chicago [Illinois], he also pastored in, at Plymouth [Plymouth United Church of Christ] I think is the name of the church.
Speaker 2: Congregational church in Detroit [Michigan]?
Speaker 1: In Detroit.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Before he moved to Los Angeles and became the pastor of the Church of Christian Fellowship [Congregational Church of Christian Fellowship, Los Angeles, California].  So, I mean, there were, there were these intersections: we were the same denomination, our parents were both sort of middle class, although in the case of Pearl's family, I mean, her father, her grandfather [Albert B. Cleage, Sr.] was a physician, the first black city physician; her, you know, there were doctors and the other doctors in the family.  So they were, they were, they were the, you know, the black elite of Detroit.  But the radical revolutionary Albert Cleage, you know, took them all farther to the left.
Story_ID: 667955
Speaker 1: The thing about Pearl [HistoryMaker Pearl Cleage] wasn't just the Congregationalist background but, you know, the sort of leftist background as well because (clears throat) you know, y- when I got, you know, when--so, her background included not just a radical father [Albert B. Cleage, Jr.] on the Shrine of the Black Madonna [Detroit, Michigan], but, I mean, there was, Malcolm X spoke there as well as Martin Luther King [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]; Jimmy [James Boggs] and Grace Lee Boggs, you know, the, the, the radical interracial couple.  I mean, Grace just died.  I mean, she was the--Grace Lee Boggs, I mean, she was Chinese and he was black and, you know, the workers and the proletariat and all that, and then the, the Republic of New Afrika people.  And, I mean, they're just--that was a lot of stuff in there but (laughter) you know, she was at Howard [Howard University, Washington, D.C.] studying literature under Owen Dodson, and I convinced her not to return but to run away with me to Atlanta, Georgia.  We almost got married at Woodstock [Woodstock Festival; Woodstock Music and Art Fair].
Speaker 2: So, you went to Woodstock?
Speaker 1: No, we didn't, we never got to Woodstock, we got no closer than we got--we were in New Paltz [New York] which was one community over and we didn't, and we knew there was a big concert over in Woodstock [White Lake, New York] we just didn't know it was gonna become Woodstock.  So we didn't go down and we didn't get married there but she joined me in Atlanta.  And we got married that October but we lived a half a block from the shrine--from the Institute of the Black World [Atlanta, Georgia].  You know, a little farther away was the King archive at the Interdenominational Theological Center [Atlanta, Georgia].  And so, the first semester that we were there--I mean the first year that we were there, she worked and did not, I think, it was for a while she worked I can't remember exactly how long--she worked, wasn't in school but I convinced Dr. Manley [Albert E. Manley] who was the president of Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia] to give her a tuition waiver.  I don't know how I did this but and I will, and I'm sure she will as well, be ever, forever grateful to Albert Manley who was really quite conservative (laughter) you know; and he gave her a tuition waiver and she went to Spelman and finished her degree there and, you know, she's now a distinguished Howard transfer student but Spelman alumna.  And, and, and, oh, by the way, wouldn't wear a cap and gown, but wore an African dress for graduation so, you know, in the spirit of, of challenging and--the establishment and unconventionality.  But--
Speaker 2: Now she's made Atlanta her home, she--?
Speaker 1: Well, she has, I mean, so, I mean, she owes me that, you know.  We, we were married for about a decade, had one child, Deignan [Deignan Lomax]; and we now sh- have five grandchildren together.
Story_ID: 667956
Speaker 1: You know, it was such a rich time to return to Atlanta [Georgia].  I mean, Atlanta didn't seem like it was going to become what it has become.  And so, the, so the first couple of years that we're there I'm teaching at Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], I'm earning like, you know, seven thousand a year, I mean, it was like, they weren't paying me anything.  She's earning some money working at the Institute for the Black World [sic. Institute of the Black World, Atlanta, Georgia], and she's, you know, got a tuition remission at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  But we're meeting everybody.  By this point, it's black power and black nationalism, so, you know, that's when I met--I remember (laughter) we, he, he was named Don Lee then when, when I invited him to come speak at the English department at Morehouse.  And we had a little reception for him at our funky little apartment near the--so, you know, this was before Madhubuti [HistoryMaker Haki Madhubuti]; this was Don Lee.  And--
Speaker 2: Right.  Right.
Speaker 1: --[HistoryMaker] Sonia Sanchez.  And, and Pearl [HistoryMaker Pearl Cleage] gets her first book of poems ['We Don't Need No Music'] published by Broadside Press [Broadside Lotus Press, Detroit, Michigan], Randall--
Speaker 2: Dudley Randall, yeah.
Speaker 1: --Dudley Randall, you know, who was a family friend and then--of hers from Detroit [Michigan].  And then, you know, we're dealing with, you know, all of the young writers and there's all this stuff going on and there's, it's not just, it's not just the Black Arts Movement, but it's also the student rebellion and Jackson State [Jackson State College; Jackson State University, Jackson, Mississippi] and, you know, not having classes but having teach-ins about--not antiwar but about anti, you know, not just antiwar stuff, well, the war [Vietnam War] is over, it was--the war isn't over yet but it's also against oppression and it's also--I mean, there's, there's a kind of radicalism emerging in the black community.  And so, you're dealing--I mean, you, you give a, a shower for somebody in SNNC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] and who shows up at the shower but it's Stokely Carmichael [Kwame Ture].  You get a call from somebody late at night and they need a place to stay and it's somebody from the Republic of New Afrika.  I mean, I mean, this, this is--so, you know, this is you're, you're challenging, you go out to Los Angeles [California] when, the summer of 1970 'cause, yeah, I've gotten married and to introduce Pearl to my family.  And my dad [Lucius Lomax] decides to drive us over to Las Vegas [Nevada] for the evening and for, for a couple of days and, you know, you spend your evening watching Sarah Vaughan and Redd Foxx and the Ike and Tina Turner Revue.  I mean, not just Tina Turner, but the Ike and Tina Turner Revue.  And you're driving back to Los Angeles and someone has murdered a judge [Harold Haley] in a courtroom in Northern California.  And John [John Mills] and Jacksons [Jonathan Jackson] are dead and all that, and [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis has been arrested.  And, you know, it's, it's, I mean, this is a, this is a world which people don't really, I mean, there's, there was rebellion going on and, and, you know, the Symbionese Liberation Army.  I mean, there's all this stuff going on, the challenging of authority, and you're a young married couple just trying to figure out what you're gonna do.
Story_ID: 667957
Speaker 1: The war [Vietnam War] ends and the decision is gonna be, are we gonna stay in Atlanta [Georgia].  I got to go back to grad- I can go back to graduate school and I get admitted to Dartmouth [Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire], so there's a possibility of going there but we go up and visit Dartmouth in the middle of the winter, so, no.  I got admitted to Berkeley [University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California]; didn't wanna go there.  Could go back to Columbia [Columbia University, New York, New York] but we made the decision to stay in Atlanta and I went to Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia] to get my Ph.D.  And Pearl [HistoryMaker Pearl Cleage] took a job working for something called the Southern Education Program [Atlanta, Georgia], which placed black teachers at small black colleges [HBCUs].  And we're in the middle of the Black Arts Movement and, you know, neighborhood art centers are developing and cool artists are there and, you know, you're--there's a black bookstore and you're reading black poetry and the, IBW is, you know, Institute of the Black World [Atlanta, Georgia] is having, you know, Mrs. Du Bois do--I remember, I remember one evening, this was the, you know, a classic evening, an IBW event.  Shirley Graham Du Bois is there and Coretta Scott King, in African garb, recites poetry.  I mean, it's just, there's things that you wouldn't believe.  And these, and, you know, these, these were people who were still--in the case of Mrs. King, you know, beautiful, vibrant widow, still traumatized, but beginning the work to build not just The King Center [Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Atlanta, Georgia] but to create a King holiday [Martin Luther King Jr. Day].  And, you know, there's, there's a lot going on (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah you would think--I think people assume that people of the past were ideologically separated, even if they were they still functioned together.
Speaker 1: No, I mean, it, it was interesting because, you know, you had the Institute for the Black World [sic.], which was, you know, on the left of the black historical movement, you know, and, you know, they were--create the black university and all that, study black history, study bla- you know, a new, a new, newly emergent ideologically driven black, black view of the black past; but also very respectful of the forbearers and that's why, you know, you would have a C.L.R. James coming, you know, you'd go--speak to the Institute of the Black World.  But, you know, there, Bobby, what was Bobby's last name?  Gosh, my brain isn't working but who was the historian for the, the Garvey movement, the West Indian guy.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Bobby Hill [Robert A. Hill].
Speaker 1: Bobby Hill.  So, Bobby is there, young Bobby Hill, you know, and all this stuff about Garvey [Marcus Garvey] and then, you know, people are writing, doing new writing on Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois] and, and, of course, Shirley Graham Du Bois is there.  And, and so this is, this is the emergence of, you know, the legitimate study of African American past, African American history.  And the reason--one of the reasons why I went to Emory was Emory was, and they had something called the Institute for the Liberal Arts [Graduate Institute of the Liberal Arts; Institute for the Liberal Arts] and they were prepared to allow me to create a, my own personal field of study which would allow me to study the Harlem Renaissance.

Speaker 1: When did you go to Emory [Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia], in?
Speaker 2: So, I start at Emory in, about '72 [1972].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I took a year of coursework, and then I wrote my dissertation.  And, and some (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Who was your, your advisor, I mean your?
Speaker 2: The, there were all my advisors--well, [HistoryMaker] Richard Long was involved in this.
Speaker 1: Oh, Richard Long?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now, he's an important figure.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, Richard was important but, but he was doing it from his perch in the African American studies program at Atlanta University [Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia], but they had--I was able to have him on my committee.  There were really very few African American--Delores Aldridge [HistoryMaker Delores P. Aldridge] who was a graduate of Clark Atlanta [Clark College; Clark Atlanta University, Atlanta, Georgia] but Clark--but got her Ph.D. at Emory, and was the first black Ph.D. at Emory.  And so there are very few people.  And, you know, I decided I wanted to write my dissertation on the Harlem Renaissance, I wrote it on Countee Cullen and the Harlem Renaissance.  My areas of specialization were the age of Booker T. Washington and Du Bois [W.E.B. Du Bois].  You know, and, you know, and you, and most of the, the people who were reviewing what I was writing were whites who knew little or who weren't expert in it.  But I got through it.  But so, this, so I, so that takes me up to the summer of 1973.
Speaker 1: Well, Countee Cullen, let me, well--
Speaker 2: Why Countee Cullen?
Speaker 1: Not why, but a lot of people don't know, they hear the name but they have no idea--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --there are people in New York [New York] that don't know why the library [Countee Cullen Library, New York, New York] is named after Countee Cullen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, but, you know, so Cullen was, I, I, you know, I thought Cullen was such an--I wrote a, sort of a critical biography of Cullen so it was about his literature but it was about his life.  What people don't understand is that during the Harlem Renaissance he was considered the premier poet of the Harlem Renaissance at the time.  And he was because he wrote poetry as a--he used traditional art, traditional form so he wrote sonnets and he wrote, all of his poetry rhymed and it was, you know, it was very, very literary poetry in a traditional sense, unlike Langston Hughes who is writing about, you know, the cabaret life, the demimonde, and he's doing it as only--he could do it in a very, and, you know, black vernacular and not, you know, not standard or literary English.  So, they were the two polar opposites.  But there was no decision in the, in the Harlem Renaissance as to who was the greater poet; I mean, Cullen was the literary editor at Opportunity magazine [Opportunity: A Journal of Negro Life], he wrote a bunch of books of poetry, he wrote a novel during that period, and he married Du Bois' daughter [Yolande Du Bois].  So, I mean, and in one sense it was a very interesting--and he was gay (laughter) so--well, well, he wasn't an out gay, but he was gay, you know.  So, there was a lot that was really interesting about him and so I wrote my dissertation on him.  And it was really about someone who I felt had talent but couldn't come to terms with his racial or sexual identity and so wasn't very honest about who he was.  But it was a great, it was a great lens for looking at the period.  And so, that was my dissertation.  And, and, and then, you know, also the, the study at Emory enabled me to really take a deep dive into two historical figures who I think were very important and have been critically important in my life, and that is Du Bois and Washington.  You know, one who creates the, you know, the Civil Rights Mo- who sort of sets the terms for the Civil Rights Movement of the 20th century with the founding of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], Dr. Du Bois, who--and then on the other hand the great accommodationist, who does create black colleges [HBCUs] and supports them and, and that's Washington.  And I found them both intriguing figures, still do today.  And, you know, and so I'm, so I was able to create this area of study for myself and get my degree.  Although it actually doesn't get awarded until 1984, but--'cause I didn't finish making the changes to my dissertation.
Story_ID: 667959
Speaker 1: What happened in the summer of '73 [1973] was that I had time off, my dad [Lucius Lomax] was very ill in Los Angeles [California], he would die in October; and a friend of mine named David Franklin, who was at this point married to Shirley Franklin, says, you know, "My law partner is running for mayor, why don't you go volunteer in his campaign?  Shirley is down there--," well, there was a bunch of other people we knew.  And so, I went down and volunteered and volunteered as a researcher and speech writer.  Wrote a speech that Maynard [Maynard Jackson] gave and the next thing I know he's driving in my front lawn and coming in and saying, "You got to come work for me."  And so--Pearl [HistoryMaker Pearl Cleage] couldn't join me because she was working for a television station [WXIA-TV, Atlanta, Georgia], but while she--she and I were doing the writing, but she couldn't go down to the campaign.  And that was what, really was a kind of a turning point for the next chapter in my life which was public service.  So, I, that, that fall, '73 [1973], I returned to Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] to teach and--but Maynard gets elected, my dad dies; and I decide to try to leave academia and go be part of the first black civ- city administration.
Speaker 2: Now, this is the beginning, I guess, not, well--
Speaker 1: It is.
Speaker 2: --sort of the beginning of a golden age in Atlanta [Georgia].
Speaker 1: Well, it is a beginning of a big change because, you know, Maynard had been the president of city council [Atlanta City Council] but the, you know, the, the wall was still up; black folks hadn't broken through, we hadn't taken over the city.  But when he won in '73 [1973], it ushered in a new era; and it became not just a golden age but an age of golden opportunity for educated, talented, new generation of black folks.  I mean, I mean, it's hard to think of me looking at me today as a bright young thing and as, you know--but we, Pearl and I, David and Shirley, we were the golden couples.  I mean, you know, they would write about old Atlanta and the new Atlanta and we were part of the new Atlanta that was, you know, taking over.  The black folks--and then, you know, then as Maynard opened up opportunities at the airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia] and through a lot of other things, blacks started coming from all over, talented black folks, to be a part of this growing city.  And we--
Speaker 2: They even came from my hometown.  I mean, Atlanta was the place to go; everybody wanted to go (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And we were on the ground floor--you know, we were on the ground floor.  And politics, it really was, Atlanta was a unique city and what really, it wasn't just that there was political opportunity, but it was a city that was going, that had so much growth potential, and it had a strong black middle class, and it had and, you know, it had colleges and universities, it had businesses.  So there were, there were elements to it which were, I don't--which were very different from other cities.  And it had a pragmatic white community that said we don't like it but we're not willing to leave it (laughter) you know, and ultimately created a pretty integrated power structure; and for the next twenty years I would be a part of it.
Story_ID: 667960
Speaker 1: Now in '75 [1975] you became director of cultural and international affairs--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --for the City of Atlanta [Georgia].  What did that entail (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, so, I mean, when I went to work for Maynard [Maynard Jackson]--Pearl [HistoryMaker Pearl Cleage] hated it, I mean, she was, she became his press secretary she, and she got, she was pregnant, we had a daughter [Deignan Lomax], she really had decided I wanna be go, come back, go, become a poet again, she didn't wanna stick with any of this.  So she wanted to go back to her writing, she didn't like the pressure, she didn't like the politics.  And we had been married for about five years at '69 [1969] to '74 [1974], so five years, so she lasted, I think, about two years.  But I was in my element.  You know, at first I had a job in the mayor's office doing research, running something called the urban observatory [Atlanta Urban Observatory], never understood what that really meant but running a, a program.  But the big opportunity that came for me was that the arts community came to Maynard and said, "We see this happening around the country, mayors investing in building cultural, out the cultural assets of the community; will you do the same thing?"  And they created a committee, and they, I staffed it, and the, the result of it after about a year of work and study was to create a bureau of cultural affairs [Bureau of Cultural and International Affairs; Office of Cultural Affairs], which had a revenue source to support it.  And from '75 [1975] until '78 [1978], I ran the arts in the city and then became parks commissioner as well, and ran the library system [Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System].  And began to build my own base of support, not only in the African American community but in the white community--I think that was a, a big difference for me.  And, and in '78 [1978] I decided I wanted to run for office.  I didn't want to run for city office, but the opportunity was to run for county [Fulton County Board of Commissioners], and I became the first African American to run and win a countywide position.  And I leveraged those contacts I had built with the white community to, to build a black-white coalition to elect me in a county [Fulton County, Georgia] which was only 35 percent black at that point.
Story_ID: 667961
Speaker 1: I want to go back just a minute and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --ask you about the Atlanta Cyclorama [Atlanta Cyclorama and Civil War Museum, Atlanta, Georgia].  Now, now that's a--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that's a big project, $14 million project, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was a, you know, my first arts restoration project.  So, the, the bureau of cultural affairs [Bureau of Cultural and International Affairs; Office of Cultural Affairs] had a couple of responsibilities, it, it, when it, when it first started.  It had a program to do, it had resources to do arts programming.  So, we were the first folks to have free concerts by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, I started that in the parks under Maynard's [Maynard Jackson] leadership.  We had street theater and two of my, two of the people who did the street theater were Sam Jackson and his wife, LaTanya [LaTanya Richardson Jackson], I mean, we had all kinds of crazy stuff.
Speaker 1: That's Samuel L. Jackson?
Speaker 2: Samuel L. Jackson.  There was all kinds of crazy stuff going on.  We created a neighborhood arts center.  We brought arts to the people.  But I, I also had two other responsibilities, one was I ran the civic center [Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center, Atlanta, Georgia] which was, you know, a, a big forty-three hundred seat auditorium and some convention facilities.  But the other sort of weird thing I had a responsibility for was the cyclorama, this circular painting of the Battle of Atlanta and a diorama which was three dimensional, a three dimensional element of it (laughter).  And it was falling apart and, you know, it became the responsibility of the first black administration to preserve the cyclorama.  And so we got the money from local foundations, $14 million, and we hired a--oh, god, I can't remember his name, but a European conservator who had worked on the cyclorama of the, of the defeat of Napoleon [Napoleon Bonaparte], you know (laughter).
Speaker 1: At Waterloo [Battle of Waterloo], yeah.
Speaker 2: At Waterloo so, I mean, so, he'd obviously done one and he got to do another one.  And so, that became a project and I did that and did it successfully.
Speaker 1: Now, this, this cyclorama, at one time was the largest painting in the world?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Largest oil painting?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know.
Speaker 1: That's what I understand.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I had all those, I never thought much--I mean, it's, it's a historical--and, you know, today you, I mean, it was, it was created in an era when Atlanta [Georgia] still genuflected to the Confederacy.  So, I didn't feel a lot of connection to it but now it's, you know, it's the history of--
Speaker 1: Does it--
Speaker 2: --a battle which we ultimately won.
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.  That's--so, in the days that it was created, I guess, it was a 'cause for, you know, kind of a, smarmy remembrance of this time, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I mean, it's the same, I mean, it's the, it's the other thing that I just hated about Atlanta was, you know, that, you know, everything was about Margaret Mitchell and 'Gone with the Wind.'  I mean, these were, these were cultural and artistic artifacts of our oppression.  And, you know, today, I mean, still, I mean, I think, the cyclorama, legitimate telling of the story of the Battle of Atlanta which was won not by the Confederacy but by the Union.  But Margaret Mitchell, she didn't tell the story correctly about black folks and slavery.  So, you know, but we all had to put on our, you know, women and their hoop skirts, whether they were black or white and, and go along with it.  I, I think, today Atlanta has come to terms with a much more inclusive sense of history.  And, you know, and the predominant story of Atlanta's history is really the power of the Civil Rights Movement and the--
Speaker 1: There's a new museum dedicated to it [Center for Civil and Human Rights, Atlanta, Georgia] as well (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, and the emergence of an African American elite, powerful elite that has transformed that city and much of the South.
Story_ID: 667962
Speaker 1: I was part of that.  But, you know, and I, and I then ran for office and I won but as I tell people, like Icarus I flew too close to the sun.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) What happened (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) You know (laughter).
Speaker 2: Now that's--well, what happened, now here you are at '78 [1978], you're elected to the Fulton County Board of Commissioners.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I wasn't satisfied.
Speaker 2: And--okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: I mean, I wanted to be mayor, I always wanted to be mayor; and Maynard [Maynard Jackson] wouldn't get out of the way, you know, he was supposed to after he'd had two terms.  Then Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], my god, I'm around all these older guys and then, you know, I'm--in '89 [1989] I was supposed to run and then Maynard decided he wanted to come back and run for a third term.  And to his credit he didn't wanna bulldoze me but he did want me to move out of the way and he, we had a number of meetings where I was supposed to defer.  I said, "No, I'm gonna fight you."  And he said, "Michael [HistoryMaker Michael Lomax], let me just tell you, I will destroy you," (laughter) and that just made me madder and I ran and, you know, I had to withdraw from the race, it was clear I wasn't gonna win.  And then by the time he was ready to retire, which was four years later, he was so pissed off at me for having challenged him in the first place.
Speaker 2: He wouldn't support you?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no and Bill Campbell won, you know.  But, but during that, I don't wanna just gloss over it--that was a very important period of the growth of the city, the expansion of the city into the suburbs.
Speaker 2: Now, you helped found something that's dear in the hearts of a lot of people I know, and that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yeah, the National Black Arts Festival.  I mean, but I--
Speaker 2: And how did you know I was gonna say that?
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause, 'cause there are people who always say that.  But so, I wanna say a couple of things.  So, first of all, I mean, I, I think the, probably the, I had a bigger impact on the economic development of the city because I did a lot of expansion of transportation outside the jurisdiction of the city; so, I mean, I drove the, I connected the rail, the, both the freeway system.  You know, part of, one of the things that happened in Atlanta [Georgia], people don't wanna talk about this is, they wouldn't let the rail line [Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority] go outside the city because they didn't want the, the northern suburbs didn't want black folks to get on the rail lines and invade those areas.  But I extended Georgia 400 [Georgia State Route 400], which was a major freeway system in, from, into the city, connected it with the city, and now the, the rail line goes up it.  And, and, you know, when you see 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' ['The Real Housewives of Atlanta'], they don't live in Atlanta, they live in the northern suburbs.  And there was no access to that before I became chairman of the Fulton County commission and black folks couldn't live up there and they're living real close to Forsyth County [Georgia] where black folks could not live.
Speaker 2: That's right.  They were banned by law from living in the county.  Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Banned by law and I was in those early demonstrations, and we marched into Forsyth County.  So, I mean, part of my--I mean, I do think that I, you know, I, I sort of gloss over the political element because the, my edu- the, the work I've done over the last twenty years which has been on, in education has been the work I have felt was really the work of my life.  But, you, you learn the--the political muscle, you, you learn how to do that kind of stuff by learning how to run a government and learning how to make policy and to pass laws and to get people to work together.
Story_ID: 667963
Speaker 1: You helped bring the '88 Democratic National Convention [1988 Democratic National Convention] to Atlanta [Georgia] too, really?
Speaker 2: Well, let me just say, my, my--for the first ten years I was in elected office I was golden.  And I was golden for the first ten years because I did everything Maynard [Maynard Jackson] wanted me to do (laughter).  Maynard was the godfather, you know, he, he was the first.  And he was an interesting figure.  I wanna say this about Maynard: I mean, Maynard and I had, we were very close, then we were broken apart, and then we became friends again before he died.  But so, when I went to work for Maynard and really met him for the first time was when he showed up on our, in, in our front lawn and said, "You've written the best speech anybody has ever written for me, I need you to come work on my campaign."  I don't think we'd written the best speech that anybody had ever written for him.  I think actually one of the best speeches ever written for him was written by the folks at the Institute for the Black World [sic. Institute of the Black World, Atlanta, Georgia] and it was called a tale of two cities, best of times and the worst of times--and a lot of people have used that but I think Maynard was one of the first.  And Maynard was a great orator.  And he--but there is an element, and there was an element of him, and but he was a great orator and he had deep roots in him, he is the, the son of, the grandson of John Wesley Dobbs.  I mean, this, this is like, you know, I mean, this is the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters.  He was, he was, if there was anybody who was, you know, authentic Atlanta it was the Dobbs family; seven daughters, his mother [Irene Dobbs Jackson] is one of them, you know, grandfather who's iconic, Sleeping Car Porter and Republican organizer for blacks to have their, their rights.  And Maynard, one of the things Maynard was able to do and I think this was in one sense a real testament to him and in some ways a betrayal for me, was that he recognized talent and he helped to develop it.  I never worked for, I, he was a, he was a very good--he gave me a lot of latitude, gave me the arts work to do, never questioned it.
Story_ID: 667964
Speaker 1: And the other thing that I did for Maynard [Maynard Jackson] when I worked for him and I, I didn't really say this, I was the head of the Bureau of Cultural and International Affairs [Office of Cultural Affairs], we used to call it the CIA--cultural and international affairs.  And the international sounded hokey except Atlanta [Georgia] was becoming an international city and the airport [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia] was what drew people there.  But, you know, so the people you worked with in the consular corps were very high ranking.  The guy who opened the--Japanese consulate general became the ambassador to the Court of St. James's, you know, which is, you know, he, he moved from Atlanta to presenting his credentials to Queen Elizabeth [Elizabeth II].  So, I mean, it wasn't like we were getting second tier people but, but was--also is a point when black political leadership had actually, you know, to some extent global impact.  I remember that the most interesting job that I ha- that I did when I was working for Maynard, there was a lot of interest from Africa in, in his role.  I mean, you know, Leopold Senghor [Leopold Sedar Senghor] who was the president of Senegal, he came to Atlanta; I was in charge of his trip.  (Laughter) I spent a week with Leopold Senghor and his wife [Colette Hubert Senghor], you know.  And it was incredible because, you know, Senghor was not just a political figure he was also a literary figure.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And he had associations with people in the Atlanta University Center [Atlanta University Center Consortium, Atlanta, Georgia].
Speaker 2: Yeah, the father of Negritude some people say.  Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Negritude, yeah, so, I mean, Leopold Senghor.  And, you know, I remember when, you know, A. Philip Randolph came to pay his respects on the new mayor.  I was in that meeting, you know.  I remember when, and, and, and, you know, royalty would come.  I mean, Prince Charles [Charles, Prince of Wales], I had to put on a program for Prince Charles. I almost lost my job; it went over budget.  You know, I remember when, you know, the, you know, I don't think we had presidents as mu- I remem- you know, Francois Mitterrand, you know, I mean, we'd deal all these people, you know.
Speaker 2: What was the (unclear)?
Speaker 1: Oh, and well, and then, and then, you know, the Africa, the other Africans, I mean, there was, at one point I had to do a, I had to do something with, oh, what's his name?  Tanzania.
Speaker 2: Nyerere [Julius Nyerere].
Speaker 1: Nyerere.  I mean, so you're getting, you're getting the, you're getting the cream of the crop here, you know, I mean, very important--because seeing black people take over cities, a lot of these international folks really understood the significance of that.
Speaker 2: Well these African leaders you're mentioning are stable African leaders whose leadership has stood the test of time (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, and they were just important people in the, you know, the transfer of colonial power to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, but these were not the African leaders who are just taking the money and trying to--yeah.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, but here's the, here's the, so the really interesting one was--so they're, you're having all of these people from Europe and, I mean, from Europe and there were, you know, and from, I, I had to accompany Maynard on his first trip to France, you know, where he delivered a speech in French, you know, I mean, this is, I mean, this was all this kind--but the, the really, the, the most significant one for me was when the South Africans wanted Maynard to acknowledge the racist government of South Africa by receiving the ambassador, which he refused to do.  And I remember having to have lunch with Pik Botha--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who was at that point the South African ambassador and became, you know, one of the last figures of the, the regime in South Africa.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the apartheid regime, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I had to have lunch with him at a club and you could tell this guy did not wanna sit down and have a meal with a person of color.  And tell him, "The mayor is not gonna see you and this is as close to city hall as you're getting: me."  You know, that was, that was important stuff.  And that, and one of the last things I did, and Maynard was pissed off at me at this point, was when I was no longer working with him, I challenged him politically, it was at the end of his--
Speaker 2: Second term?
Speaker 1: --second--third term.
Speaker 2: Third term, okay.
Speaker 1: After Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young].  And Nelson Mandela comes to town and because I'm chairman of the Fulton County commission [Fulton County Board of Commissioners] I have to join in welcoming Nelson Mandela to town and I'm in all those pictures.  It was (unclear) (laughter) you know, Maynard was pissed off: "What's he doing over here?"
Story_ID: 667965
Speaker 1: So what happened though was that--so in the first eight years, from '78 [1978] when I got elected to '88 [1988], really to '89 [1989], I was pretty, you know, I was a part of the, the establishment.  I was copasetic with Maynard, Andy.  You know, I was running the gover- the other government that they needed, which was the county government; and opening up economic opportunities and other opportunities for black folks.  I was running the big county hospital, Grady [Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia], and all that.  And, you know, I was staying in my lane which was I'm the next generation and I will succeed after the, the Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young], Maynard Jackson generation decides--when they decide they're ready to exit stage right.  So, I did a lot of things while I was there and got a lot, and, and I not only did the economic but I did the arts and, you know, one of the things that I created in addition to--an arts council which became a major funder of--as did the Bureau of Cultural Affairs [Office of Cultural Affairs].  I, I wanna just stop at that for a moment because those were very important because they provided local funds for artists and, you know, there really were outside of what happened on the black college campuses [HBCUs], there was really nothing going on.  And I remember when a young director named [HistoryMaker] Kenny Leon was directing at the Alliance Theatre and he wanted to do 'The Gospel at Colonus' [Lee Breuer].  I mean, the--yeah, the gosp- it was, it's a, it was a gospel version of 'Oedipus at Colonus' [Sophocles] with a guy named Morgan Freeman in the lead role; and he couldn't raise enough money to produce the play.  And it was the Fulton County Arts Council that put money into the play.  And 'Gospel at Colonus' was one of the most successful runs at the theater but and Kenny Leon is today, you know, one of the major black directors on Broadway and television and film.

Speaker 1: I remember Alvin Ailey didn't ever perform, had never performed in Atlanta [Georgia] until Maynard [Maynard Jackson] became mayor and I was head of the cultural affairs and we were running the civic center [Boisfeuillet Jones Atlanta Civic Center, Atlanta, Georgia] and we could open the civic center for the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater] in the mid-'70s [1970s] to come and perform there.  Alvin Ailey--Alvin Ailey, you know.  The first time I realized that Samuel L. Jackson was a, was not just a guy I had gone to college with [at Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia] and the guy who did street theater but was very special was when he performed in 'A Soldier's Play' [Charles Fuller] directed by [HistoryMaker] Douglas Turner Ward and that was coming to Atlanta because there was a Bureau of Cultural Affairs [Office of Cultural Affairs] that could help pay for it, or a Fulton County Arts Council.  I mean, there, suddenly Atlanta was on the map for art, black artists.  When we opened a neighborhood art center in the early '70s [1970s], Romare Bearden was one of our patrons.  And Romare Bearden was coming into a neighborhood which now, you know, which got torn down to build the Atlanta Stadium [New Atlanta Stadium; Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia].  You know, I mean, this, there was a kind of interface between the--so part of what was happening to Atlanta was it was becoming part of a global cultural; a more, a more sophisticated, a more urbane, a more cosmopolitan, cultural and artistic community that involved black people.  It wasn't just the Metropolitan Opera coming down and performing a couple of times every year; it wasn't just, you know, the Atlanta Ballet doing 'The Nutcracker' [Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky].  There were black artists at very high levels doing real work.  And today when you see in a black commercial arts community making films and TV shows and all that--that has its roots in the '70s [1970s] opportunities that were created that began to attract that talent to the community.  And writers like Pearl [HistoryMaker Pearl Cleage] and others were the, the, so, you know, so that there was a--you know, Sam and LaTanya [LaTanya Richardson Jackson] and Kenny [HistoryMaker Kenny Leon] and Pearl they were part of an early generation and, you know, and, and when Sam comes back, you know, in the '70s [1970s], later in the '70s [1970s] to be in 'School Daze,' he isn't coming back as street theater, he's coming back as somebody else, I mean, this, the, the world is changing--or 'Jungle Fever.'  I mean, the, you know, the, so, the, these, these things happened because you created an environment where they could happen.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: And so, one of the things that we did, it was in 1988, we decided to create a, there was a, there was an, there was a Piedmont Arts Festival [Piedmont Park Arts Festival]; there was no black arts festival.  We created a black arts festival [National Black Arts Festival] and let me tell you, the most controversial thing about it was its name, "What does that mean?  Black?  That's excluding--no, people can't--."  So, you know, but, you know, we had [HistoryMaker] Harry Belafonte and Cicely as the ambassadors of it and--Tyson [Cicely Tyson]; and, you know, and, and what it did was to further open up in this notion that you could bring legitimate theater and dance and, you know, with a global, from a global perspective and it could perform and find audiences in Atlanta.  That was something that I was involved in.
Story_ID: 667967
Speaker 1: And I feel very proud about that, but I would also say that just as with my mother [Almena Lomax], you know, when she went south and she knew that there was something that was a bigger story for her, this was not entirely fulfilling for me.  And I, I really pushed the envelope, I mean, I wanted, I wasn't satisfied being a county commissioner [on the Fulton County Board of Commissioners], I wasn't satisfied being an understudy, I wanted to be the main event, that would--shows you that I, that was, you know, my, my focus was on myself.  And when Maynard had had two terms, Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] had had two terms, I thought it was my turn; and then Maynard comes back and says, "Well, I'm not through yet, I want a third term, I wanna--because I don't think I was treated with the respect that I was due as the first black mayor."  There was a lot of hostility toward--
Speaker 2: So, so, just backtrack.  Maynard is the first black mayor, he serves--a term is how long in Atlanta [Georgia] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) He serves for eight years.  And I will--
Speaker 2: He serves for eight years and then?
Speaker 1: And then followed by Andy.  But I will just say something to, about Maynard.  He, he got the brunt of the anger and the hostility of the white community for serving in that role.  And he did things which, you know, pushed the envelope.  He, you know, said, "If we're gonna build this airport, sure, but black folks are gonna be involved in it.  We're gonna require"--
Speaker 2: Who's--now where did the idea for Hartsfield [William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport; Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, Georgia] come from, the largest airport in the United States?  Where did that idea come from?
Speaker 1: Well, I think it, it didn't just--I mean, it came from the fact that you could see that this airport that could expand, it had the ability to expand, was a hub for what, an airline that was gonna become dominant: Delta [Delta Air Lines, Inc.].
Speaker 2: Was this something that Maynard Jackson thought of himself, or (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, I don't think, I think it was, I don't, I--I, I, I, I think the notion, so the, there had to be an expansion of Hartsfield because Delta demanded it.  And so that the, you know, the confluence of time for Delta to, to have a new airport and for Maynard to be mayor--that just happened to be coming together.  What was unique about it was that he required that there would be joint ventures, that there would be African Americans involved in it.  And, you know, it had, that got everything from hostile editorials to, you know, federal investigations.  I mean, this was, this was--but what you, what you had to say about Maynard was he, he had the courage of his convictions, he stood for what he believed.  And at the end of the day, this has been a huge boon for Atlanta.  It's a, such a vibrant economy and, and it's a vibrant economy that, where African Americans and whites have done well together and others.  What is, it hides beneath all of that, and what I think is its Achilles' heel, is that low income poor people just--low income poor black folks, I mean, if you were that, that--at the bottom, your mobility has been difficult.  But it has been a city which has attracted talented African American strivers and made and warmly welcomed them and become a community for them.
Speaker 2: Yeah, the presence of the airport, CNN gives it a national--international scope (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well, just--well, the, you know, the presence of the airport is the economic and transport- it was always a transportation hub that become a, became an economic hub.  And then with CNN which was serendipity.  I mean, you have to give this to, this was the--Ted Turner, I mean, and, you know, that a guy who owned an outdoor advertising firm would decide, "I'm gonna create a global television network," and he has the, the stamina and the nerve to, to drive it.  And all together now it's, now it's not just a, a global transportation hub, it's not just a, an emerging global econ- regional economy, it's also now a global communications hub.
Story_ID: 667968
Speaker 1: So, all of those things.  And then that sort of fed into Maynard--to Andy [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] who says it should be, you know, let's push the internationalism further with bringing the Olympics.  And--
Speaker 2: So, Maynard Jackson's term is over in?
Speaker 1: His--so, his term ends, so he's, the first term is '74 [1974] to '82 [1982], Andy is '82 [1982] to '90 [1990] but in '89 [1989] Maynard comes back and says, "I'm gonna run for a third term that will--," the election will be in '89 [1989].  And I'm supposed to run and I say, "I'm going to run," and he says, "I'm gonna destroy you," and I said, "No, you're not," and I'm able to raise enough money to get in the race but I see that railroad coming and it's gone hit me, and I have to withdraw and stay on the Fulton County commission [Fulton County Board of Commissioners].  And so that the four years that he's mayor were four years of icy--Maynard, Maynard was too much of a gentleman to be, you know, openly aggressive, but icy; and he tried to stop me from getting reelected in '90 [1990], but I got reelected.  And then at the end of his term when he has, had this, you know, this third term to personal success, I suppose, and gratification, I run again.  But by that point I'm damaged goods.  If I don't, I mean, the, I couldn't, a lot of people angry with me and most, the person most angry was Maynard and he wasn't gonna put any of his resources behind me; he put 'em all behind a guy named, a young politician named Bill Campbell.  And I stayed in the race and got my behind kicked.  So I lost convincingly, I tell people, no question about it.  And had to make a decision at that point 'cause I'm out of office at that--I don't have, you have to, it's resign to run, I've lost, lost ignominiously, publicly; I've got a politician who has beat me, who has a great sense of humor and loves to make fun of, of the people he's defeated.  (Gesture) I think we've seen this again.  You know, so, I mean, the, and that was when I made the decision that I had to figure out what it was I had learned, what muscles I had built by being a--in politics, I had learned how to make change, I had learned how to run things, I'd learned how to challenge establishments and, and that's when I decided I would devote my, the rest of my career with a transition perhaps into public service through education.

Speaker 1: We didn't talk about the '88 Democratic convention [1988 Democratic National Convention, Atlanta, Georgia]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --or the Olympic Games [1996 Summer Olympics, Atlanta, Georgia].  Are they, did you play a significant role in those (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, so I--well, I, look, the '88 [1988] convention, Andy was mayor.  I was co-chair of the convention with Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] and Joe Frank Harris who was the governor.  Now, you know, we brought the Democratic convention, that was the first, you know, it was a global event brought to Atlanta [Georgia].  You had a white governor, you know, the, one of the last Democrats to serve in that position; there--I think, there were only two other governors after that, moderate to conservative white Democrat governor, you know, a global superstar is the mayor and yours truly (laughter).  And we brought the convention, nominated Michael Dukakis, so it was, you know, it was not a winning convention.  But we brought it and I think planted the seeds for Andy's big idea, which was to bring the Olympic Games, you know, to Atlanta.  And, and that work had started through a partnership between Andy and Billy Payne [William Porter Payne] who was the guy who would lead the games and whose idea I think it was and who enlisted Andy in it.  Andy was the chief architect of that because what, what won the bid was that Andy was able to convince the African and other International Olympic Committee members of color to vote for Atlanta.  I mean, Atlanta was--Atlanta?  The Olympics?  But the notion that it would come to the South, that it would be a city that was, had such a clearly defined black identity I think they found intriguing; and Maynard [Maynard Jackson]--not Maynard, Andy was able to go all around the world with Billy Payne and with the, bankrolled by the Atlanta business community and win votes.  And, you know, so that when the, by the time the decision was made, Maynard is in a third term, I'm chairman of the Fulton County commission [Fulton County Board of Commissioners], I therefore have, I'm on the, the Olympic organizing committee but not really a major player because I'm sort of persona non grata.  I wasn't in Tokyo [Japan] when the announcement was made but I was in the parade.  You know, I mean, I just that, I was just, I was, I was a lesser figure.  And then by the time the--I joined with, in the official visit to Barcelona [Spain] when we went to those games [1992 Summer Olympics], which were the preceding games, I went with the governor and the mayor and all those people, but--in '92 [1992].  But by the time the games got, came to town, I was a former elected official and had a minor role, but I went to a whole lot of sports events, (laughter) you know.

Speaker 1: Your political life ended, ends in what, 19--?
Speaker 2: My political life ends in 1993--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when I run for mayor and lose to Bill Campbell, and--yeah, 1993.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I'm dead meat.  At, by 1993 at the age of, what forty-seven or something like that, I am history; I'm dead meat.  No one will ever know me again.  I have, as I said flown too close to the sun and my wings have been melted and I fall on my behind.  And, yeah, the question is in '93 [1993] will I have any kind of a career ever again.
Speaker 1: Well, I, you know, I, we see, you know, that there have been many times in the history of this country where people look like they're done with something and then they bounce back.  But something happened I guess, in, in that period that convinced you, you needed to do something else--or you wanted to do something else.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So, I had, so I did a couple of things.  I said, well, maybe I should go into business.  And I had tried this, my hand at buying a funeral home [Amistad Corporation, Atlanta, Georgia] and operating that--that was, I lived to talk about it, I succeeded, but I didn't wanna do that.  I didn't wanna be a businessperson.  I ran a small nonprofit.  But I did decide--so here's what I did decide.  I, I, I said I wanna commit my life to social change and to changing opportunity for my own community; and I think that I'm probably best suited to do that not as a politician but as an educator.  But I don't wanna do it in the classroom, I don't want--I wanna find a bigger venue in which to do that, and that's when I decided that I would, I would find a way to become a college president.  Now, I had a Ph.D. and but I had really not had a--I kept teaching from '70 [1970] up, up until about '88 [1988] I was still teaching at Spelman [Spelman College, Atlanta, Georgia].  But I really, people thought of me, I, he's the chairman of the Fulton County commission [Fulton County Board of Commissioners], people always called me Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman--not Dr. Lomax [HistoryMaker Michael Lomax].  And I remember that Morehouse [Morehouse College, Atlanta, Georgia], I said, boy, you know, I really would love to be president of Morehouse.  And I remember--I, I, I did get an interview with the search committee.  And I remember that one of the members of the search committee, who was at that time the CEO of Coca-Cola [The Coca-Cola Company], looking at me and saying, "Michael, why are you here?  You're not an academic; you're a politician."  And I realized that I had, in the minds of most people, I was a politician; I wasn't an academic.  And so, I had to decide to do two things: I had to reinvent myself, and I probably had to leave town.  And that was when I made the decision that I would find a transitional job and that was in a nonprofit called the National Faculty, and it was a small nonprofit in Atlanta [Georgia].  But the reason why it seemed like the right one to do is I was on the board of it and the guy who had been president of the non- had been named the president of American University in Washington, D.C.  So I said if it was good enough for Ben Ladner [Benjamin Ladner], this may be a good enough launch.  And so, for three years I led this small nonprofit that worked with school systems and universities to provide professional development for schools.  And after doing it for about three or four years I got my first college presidency [at Dillard University, New Orleans, Louisiana]; and I think that's where we should stop.
