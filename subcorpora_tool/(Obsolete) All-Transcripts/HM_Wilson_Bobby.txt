Story_ID: 29633
Speaker 1: Okay, now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and then I'm gonna ask about your father's side of the family.  We'll start with your mother.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Lillie, L-I-L-L-I-E, Mae, M-A-E, Wilson.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was her maiden name?
Speaker 2: Coleman.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Wait a minute, you'd better let me go get this survey.  Date of birth--
Speaker 1: If you come close to it, that's fine.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Just get us in the ballpark.
Speaker 2: October 28, 1919 [sic] [1923], see I'm getting it, I'm gonna get it mixed up with my father's date of birth.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You'd better let me get my survey, now.
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, we'll get to your father and maybe you can figure out which one is which.  But, okay, all right.  And was she born in--?
Speaker 2: She was born in Lowndes County, Mississippi and in parenthesis, you can put Columbus.  That's the city, and, you know, when I use the word Columbus.
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a Lowndes County, Mississippi as well as a Lowndes County, Alabama?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, are they named for the same Lowndes?
Speaker 2: Not really.  And just for historical purposes, even though we use the word Columbus, that was the city, but all of us was born basically and grew up out in the country which was Lowndes County.  And coincidentally, my wife was born in Lowndes County, Alabama (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  First of all, how far back can you trace them?  Do they have stories that go all the way back into slavery or even beyond?
Speaker 2: I can, on my mother's side, dealing with her father, I only know that there were two males, he had a brother and he had a sister.  That's all I know.  I never, I never saw either one.  He passed before, my grandfather passed before I was born, and of course, his brother passed before I was born.  So I never saw my grandfather on my mother's side.
Speaker 1: Were there any stories about him?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Supposedly, he was named Ed Coleman and supposedly, he came into Mississippi, Columbus, in that area out of Alabama.  I was told that he was half Indian and half white.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he wasn't black.  He was half Indiana and half white.
Speaker 2: No, as far as I know, he, there was no reference to black.  And I never--the two boys settled down in Lowndes County, Mississippi.  The female went to a place called Tupelo, Mississippi.  And that's where she settled, and she sort of, as history would say, she disappeared in the white community.  And no one, I was never able to get any more information about her.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, on my grandmother's side, they came out a place called Noxubee County, Mississippi which is adjacent to Lowndes County.  They, you know, I lived about two or three miles from Noxubee, N-O-X-U-B-E-E, County.  And so, and I only knew my grandmother, a little bit about, I don't know anything about her parents, but I think they would go back into slavery.  But I did have an opportunity to know some of her sisters.  I'm not gonna be remembering too much about 'em right now, but she did have some sisters that settled in Noxubee.  And so we had the experience of visiting with them from time to time.
Speaker 1: What did they do for a living?  What did their families do for a living?
Speaker 2: My grandmother lived on a plantation down there.  And so she left the plantation, actually married Ed Coleman, and they basically farmed.  He, the thing I heard about him, he spent all his time hunting.  You know, he was a hunter.  He didn't really, he didn't believe in that working on no farm.  And, but he had a lot of kids, so the kids--
Speaker 1: Did he own the land himself?
Speaker 2: He owned some land, yeah, he owned, he owned some land, out, down, what we call down in the woods.  He did not own the land that he farmed.  He sort of sharecropped that.  He would, he would, it was sort of like renting, I guess.  You worked the crops and you'd give the person part of the money.
Speaker 1: Sharecropping?
Speaker 2: Yeah, sharecropping.  But he owned the land that he lived on, a small piece of land.  But he didn't have, he didn't have any open land where you could farm.  So he would farm and then give a portion of it back, whatever the ratio was for sharecropping.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: His brother only had one child and I grew up to know him.  Of course, he was right around the same age as my mother so as far as kinfolk over on the Coleman side, there was basically one other person that was a Coleman that was not my uncle or aunt or my mother's sister or brother.
Speaker 1: Okay, now--
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: Oh, go ahead.  What were you gonna say?
Speaker 2: As far as work is concerned, as I said, my grandfather passed and my grandmother moved to the city.  And she actually bought a, she owned her own home in Columbus, Mississippi when she died.  To be very frank, I don't know too much about exactly how she earned her income, but she always had money and she had her own house.  So.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So--
Speaker 2: Now, on my--that was on my mother's side.  Grand daddy, I mean the grandparents and, yeah.
Story_ID: 29634
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you mother [Lillie Mae Coleman] talk about growing up and what it was like for her?  Did she grow up in Columbus [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: No, she grew up in the, out there in the little place called Plum Grove, out in Lowndes County.  And she would have grown up on a farm, but for some strange reason, the girls didn't really do a lot of work.  And she married my father [Johnny B. Wilson] at an early age, and so she was just a housewife cause he didn't want her to work.  So he went out and earned the family keep and she basically stayed at home.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so I was born, and then two years later, I had a brother.  So, and she had a series of ten kids, anywhere from two to three years apart.  And so she basically took care of us.
Speaker 1: Now, did she get a chance to go to high school or college or anything?
Speaker 2: My mother, no, no, she didn't go to college.  My mother went, she had some high school.  My father, I remember him telling me about he played football, but neither one ever finished high school.  But my mother could actually teach me how to read and do things and help me with my high school homework, not necessarily with the math, but the other part she could help me with.  Once I got to geometry and algebra, I was sort of on my own.
Speaker 1: Now, what impression did you have of your mother's experiences of, I guess, growing up in Lowndes County [Mississippi]?  I mean what was it like?  Was it better than some places or not as good or what?
Speaker 2: I think what happened was that as a child, her father [Ed Coleman] was very protective.  So she didn't have to worry about, the race thing wasn't much of a factor.  I mean we was right in the heart of Mississippi, but no one messed with Ed Coleman nor his kids.  So, she had it--
Speaker 1: So he had a, are there any stories associated with those who did mess with him?
Speaker 2: They just didn't, you just left Ed Coleman alone.  He was down there.  He had his stuff going on.
Speaker 1: Lived in the woods, and he liked to hunt--
Speaker 2: Lived in the woods.
Speaker 1: --so he must have had a gun with him a lot?
Speaker 2: Had a gun, always had a gun.  And he would hunt year around.  And when you say things are not in season, he'd say salt and black pepper was the season (laughter).  So, those are some of the stories I heard about him, and so as far as the whites were concerned in Mississippi, they didn't fool with Ed, and they didn't fool around with his brother, Mims.  So the two of them, just sort of leave them alone.  And, of course, James Coleman came along, my cousin, the only one that I knew on my mother's side, on her father's side, and he was basically had a similar reputation.  And that's how they lived.  It's gonna be a quite different story when I start talking about how my daddy was, dealt with it, but and so by her marrying early, which she spent most of her life as married.  And see my father owned his own land.  So as soon as they got married, they built a house.
Story_ID: 29635
Speaker 1: Now, let's go to your father now.  What was your father's full name and can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Johnny, J-O-H-N-N-Y, B, and I don't know, I think it's just B.  I don't think it even had any meaning.
Speaker 1: Like Johnny B. Good (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)
Speaker 1: Johnny B. Wilson?
Speaker 2: Right, Wilson.
Speaker 1: All right, and what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: He was born on May the 8, that was 1990--1919.  That was his birth, that was his year.  I had my mother's year wrong.
Speaker 1: Was she substantially younger than him?
Speaker 2: Yes, she--
Speaker 1: Maybe in the '20s [1920s]--
Speaker 2: I'll go back and get her papers (unclear) (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --maybe she was born in the '20s [1920s], I guess.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think she--
Speaker 1: You were born in '42 [1942], so?
Speaker 2: Now, you're making me, forcing me to remember, '23 [1923].
Speaker 1: Oh, 1923.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was born in 1919?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was he born in that same area [Lowndes County, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Right, same area.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Matter of fact, all of us was born in the same area.  So he owned his, he was reared by his grandfather on his mother's side.  And his, I never knew my father's father because he passed before I was born.  And neither, I never knew either one of my grand, I knew my father's grand daddy and grandmother, but I never knew my father's mother nor his daddy.
Speaker 1: So they were both passed?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they were both passed.
Speaker 1: Do you know a lot about the ancestors on your father's side?  Do they have any stories about--?
Speaker 2: As far back as I can go is that when they freed the slaves, my great-great granddaddy which would have been my father's great granddaddy, he was given an opportunity to buy land.  I guess they sold Negroes land in Mississippi.  You could buy up to eighty-two acres, I think, probably a nickel an acre.  It wasn't all that expensive.  But, so that's how we got the land.  He bought the land.  But then he was still bitter, so he left Mississippi and settled in Oklahoma, out in Wagner, Oklahoma.  You've probably heard of Wagner and Tulsa and those places.  So he settled out there.
Speaker 1: For Wagner, Oklahoma.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.  And he was so bitter, he actually changed his name because his last name was Jones.  See my father's granddaddy was named Jones on his--
Speaker 1: So that was the name he had as a slave?  It was Jones and he--?
Speaker 2: Yeah, but the grandfather kept the name.  The great grandfather that left Mississippi changed his name from Jones to Jonus.  So you go out to Oklahoma, the persons that are my kinfolk out there would be Jonus with the u-s ending rather than Jones with the e-s ending.  And he repeated the process in Oklahoma because when they allowed the Indians [sic] [Native American] to have a run on the land, I think they could get up to 150 acres of land. So he also owned land in Oklahoma, (unclear) wind up with some oil wells on it.
Speaker 1: Oh, so he got in on the Oklahoma land rush?
Speaker 2: On the Oklahoma land rush as well.  And I think that allowed them to get, he married a Native American.  And so then they had another set of kids out there.  So we actually have had family reunions out in Oklahoma where we met the other side of the family.  And so that land wind up being rich in oil and things like that.  The only Rolls Royce that I've ridden in my family was the Rolls Royce that my cousin, Elizabeth had out in Oklahoma.  And she, I believe was a school teacher, so she surely didn't buy it on a school teacher's salary.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's quite a story there.
Speaker 2: And, a matter of fact, my daughters, when we would go to the family reunion or go through there visiting, they were always wanting my (laughter), Elizabeth to take 'em for a ride in the Rolls (laughter).  So that was, so that being taken, that is far back as I can go on the Oklahoma side.  And I remember when I was growing up as a child that my aunts from Oklahoma would always come to visit the people in Columbus [Mississippi].  And whether they were cousins or whether they were sisters, brothers, we had that exchange of the two families.  And they would always come to Mississippi, telling me they want me to come to Oklahoma to go to college.  So when I basically knew I was going to college, either in Oklahoma or somewhere.  That was never a factor about whether I would go to college because I had everybody telling me they wanted me to go to college.  I had pretty good grades in high school so they a look at your report card and tell you, tell you what your future gonna be for them.  And so the, when we go back to Columbus on my grandfather's [Ed Coleman] side, having the land allowed my mother [Lillie Mae Coleman] to stay at home and be a housewife.  And my father wasn't all that big on farming himself cause he mainly did construction work and stuff like that over in the city.  But, so he allowed us to farm the land.  And, but we never had to miss a day out of school to work on the farm.  So you'd work on the weekends.  You'd work early in the morning before you go to school, and you'd work into the evenings after school.  So I would have perfect attendance, but we still farmed.  I think, went through a stage, I don't remember where they allowed you to raise six, farm six acres of cotton.  They had regulations on how many acres you could farm in cotton and corn anyway.  So whatever that was, he would have us to do it.  So that kept my brother and I pretty busy, taught us how to work.  So it wasn't no question about my motivation to go to college, after following that mule (laughter).
Story_ID: 29636
Speaker 1: (Laughter) I just wanna go back to your father's [Johnny B. Wilson], now your father, you said he had some high school and played football?
Speaker 2: Right, he, he--
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school they went to, the high school they went to?
Speaker 2: That was a, basically, the same high school that I went to.  It was Hunts High School in Columbus, Mississippi.  They didn't have but one high school for blacks and that was Hunts High in Columbus.
Speaker 1: Was it named after a black educator?
Speaker 2: It was named after the principal.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: His last name was Hunts, I think it R. E. Hunts.  I don't remember but the "R" probably came for Robert, but we always used the word R. E. Hunts.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He was the principal, and he had a brother there that ran the drugstore.  So the Hunts family was sort of educated.  And--
Speaker 1: Okay, now, so did your father talk about growing up or what it was like for him coming up?  Did he have any good stories?
Speaker 2: Yeah, he--
Speaker 1: Or even bad stories?
Speaker 2: --a lot of bragging about how great a football player he was, which I doubt (laughter), but--
Speaker 1: Now, you're a pretty good sized person.  About what--
Speaker 2: I'm a little taller than he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh, he was, he was big enough to play football, but I'm just saying, you know, some stories get longer and longer.  He was, my father was always the kind of person that had a lot of personality.  He always had a job.  He could always figure a way not to have to work himself to death on the job, but get the job done.  He would give you the shirt off his back, and we also ran a little store, a little country store, my mother [Lillie Mae Coleman] did, now that I think about it, a little later on in life.  We had a little store and part of the problem with the store is he would loan folks stuff on credit and he was just a very giving type of person.  And I was a little bit more conservative so I was concerned that he was giving some stuff away that I needed.  But he, between working construction work or doing something over in the city to keep a steady income coming, and making sure we did what we needed to do out on the farm to raise cotton and corn and some milk, you know, cows.  And we'd sell a little milk.  And then, of course, you would raise hogs.  And, of course, that was your food, especially during the winter months.  And so he always provided and he always gave us an opportunity to go to school.  We didn't have to be out of school to work.  Now, he would hire people on the weekend to pick the cotton cause we, you didn't have enough time to pick it if you're going to school, you wasn't going to be able to pick it, get it all out of the field before the winter come.  So he, we would hire people on Saturdays and they would, to help pick the cotton.  You wasn't gonna have any more than about, if you had six acres, you were probably getting four or five bales of cotton out of it.  And then you sell it and right, to me it wasn't a lot of money, now, you know, two or three hundred dollars a bale.  And somehow, he'd just take that little money and spread it.  And we still had plenty of things for Christmas and B.B. guns and cap pistols and whatever.  It just seemed like it was so little money to me, but somehow he had a way of stretching it.  And so technically speaking, as we got, like we, as we got older, and then my mother came up with this idea that she could run this little grocery store/cafe and she got in the business of running the store.  And they really started making some money.  Cause, you could also sell beer in Lowndes County [Mississippi], but you couldn't sell beer in Noxubee County [Mississippi].  But the store was only about four or five miles from the county line and so all the folks out of Noxubee County would come across the line so they could buy the beer.  And then it would stay open on the weekends so it'd just be cars and cars and cars.  So they made quite a bit of money out of this little grocery store/cafe.  But my mother left the store in '58 [1958].  The Church of God in Christ came down and ran a revival, set up a tent.  And she went to the revival, and she got converted into the Church of God in Christ and that mean she couldn't sell beer cause they are teetotalers (laughter).  And so she actually walked away from the little store/beer joint in '58 [1958].
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pause here and change tapes.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 29637
Speaker 1: Now, when you think about your mother's [Lillie Mae Coleman] personality and your father's [Johnny B. Wilson] personality, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: I probably take after my mother, my mother a little more.  But it's really a pretty nice balanced combination knowing the nature of the two individuals.  My mother, as I said, did well when she ran the store cause I was about to talk about (unclear).  But I think on the one hand, I'm sort of nice like my father, but I'm probably not, I'm a little more guarded when it comes to just giving stuff and forgetting and loaning and stuff like that.  Both of 'em promoted education.  My mother was probably, paid more attention with the encouragement part.  She wasn't all that big on patting you on the back about things, but she would say little things so you, you were pretty good.  And I was able to, she kept my grandfather's desk [Ed Coleman].  So this man had a desk.  And I was always impressed with, here it is someone going that far back with a desk, like, what were you doing with a desk?  Obviously, he was an educated man.  And so probably a little, I'm more friendly.  Probably my friendliness probably came from my daddy [Johnny B. Wilson].  But my management probably came from my mother.  My mother took care all of the bills and all the management of the house.  Well, it turns out it'd probably be nice if my wife would do it, but that's not her nature.  So I do that.  I remember when they took me with them to buy a new car.  It was a 1956 Ford.  And I remember my mother counting out the money.  And so she handled more of the business part of the family.  He would go out and work and bring in the resources, and then she would pretty well manage it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, tell me this.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Do I have a?
Speaker 1: An earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: As, to go back to try to remember what it was like.  I can go all the way back to elementary school--
Speaker 1: Is that as far back as you can, I mean--?
Speaker 2: But see, you gotta keep in mind, we went through something called pre-premier.  So that was pretty far back.  You were like four or five years old (laughter).  They had the pre-premier, the premier.  Then you finally got into first grade.  But I can't go much, I don't remember a whole lot past, if I start talking about my schooling, I can remember the bit where I went to school, where all of us was in the same class, and we was in the same building.  And that would have been to go back to the, what we call the pre-premier.  Now--
Speaker 1: Did you have to go far to go to school from where you lived?
Speaker 2: No, the school was right, well, we say right up on the hill.  It was right across from the farm.  In other words, you could step off of our land and if you crossed the road, you were at the school.  It turned out that I lived a little further down the road and my grandfather, my father's, granddaddy had the house that was closer to the school.  But it was all, we just walked.  And so the school was right there, at the elementary.  And then what they did, they actually built a new school where they separated us.  And they built it right next to the old school.  And so they had eight grades out in the country.  So you could go up to the eighth grade out there, and then you'd go to Columbus [Mississippi] for high school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the school?
Speaker 2: Everything was Plum Grove.
Speaker 1: Plum Grove, okay.  So it was in Plum Grove?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Now, I can remember my brother being my, you know, the brother that was age-wise next to me, I can remember some vague things about him crying for a bottle or something I had.  I can remember him wanting the label off of a Pepsi-Cola bottle.  He didn't realize the label wouldn't come off.  Or he wanted it cause I had it, type of thing.  And I can remember he was actually a little selfish baby (laughter).  And my mother would have to sort of smooth us over cause I wasn't giving it up.
Speaker 1: How many of you are there in terms of siblings?
Speaker 2: Well, it was like, the two of us grew up together.  And then after that they started having girls.  So they had four girls before another boy.
Speaker 1: Okay, you did say earlier it was ten all together, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And so my brother and I grew up and we worked as a team, and we worked the farm cause my mother wouldn't let the girls work it, work in the fields.  And then the next set of boys, they almost, we don't have a whole lot in common in terms of, cause I was basically off and gone to college and they were just like, almost like cousins or something (laughter).  We didn't really know each other that well.  But that's about as much as I can remember, my brother and I growing up and the little things that we did.  And it was certain things he wanted as a baby and then schooling.
Story_ID: 29638
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of Plum Grove [Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Plum, it's just plain old country, and what it was known for, of course, the church, the Baptist church was right up there on the hill.
Speaker 1: What was the name of it?
Speaker 2: Everything Plum Grove.
Speaker 1: Plum Grove Baptist Church?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They had some Pleasant Groves around and some other groves, but this was Plum Grove.  It was right up on the hill, and if I go back to the early part as a child, the, everything would have been centered around the chickens and the hogs and the cows, type of thing.  It wasn't, and I was made fully aware that we owned our land and we stayed on it and farmed our own land.  And everybody surrounding us was either working for sharecropping and living on someone else land.  And there were only one real wealthy African, black person in the community, and he had land that people would sharecrop on, had something they called quarters back in those days.  I don't know if they call it like a quarter.  And they had these various pockets of quarters and this land was owned by someone.  You have all these little houses in these little communities.  And so we were fully aware that it was nice to have your own land.  It would have been Anthony with his land because he had a lot of land, and, of course, he had people working for him and on a regular basis.  And, of course, I guess you worked a fourth, they called it, so you'd get a fourth of your sharecrop.  I think in those days you got a fourth.  But I was exempted from that kind of thing.  But I had a compassion for some of my friends who had to actually pick cotton, chop.  In the spring, it was chopping, in the fall it was picking cotton.  In between the chopping and the picking cotton, the only time they could go to school was after the chopping.
Speaker 1: Now, what is actually chopping cotton?  What does that mean cause I think a lot of people are confused.  You plant it, and it grows, but what's the chopping part?
Speaker 2: Well, you would have grass growing along so you go ahead and you're basically chopping the grass out.
Speaker 1: Like weeding it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And so I would see my friends who couldn't go to school.  And I was pretty concerned about that because they didn't have the freedom to, their parents, the white man said they was gonna pick cotton, so they had to pick cotton.  And when they finished picking cotton, then you could see 'em at school.
Speaker 1: Now, were you aware, from what I've heard and stuff, not every little community had a school and people had to walk long distances in Mississippi to get to a small school?
Speaker 2: And that was true about, that was true about my community.  It just turned out that everything was centered around this little hill and we owned land that led up to the hill.  The kids that was off, five, ten miles, some of them had to try to get to this school.  They were eventually bussed into the school.  So you're correct, but what happened earlier on before they started building these isolated schools where you had more than one grade, in a lot of cases, they would just send someone there and let them teach in the church.  But they were teaching all grades anyway, whether they were in the school or in the church when I first started.
Story_ID: 29639
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I imagine that church was a big thing in Plum Grove, I guess.  Was it a big thing in your family, church?
Speaker 2: Yeah, church was a big thing.  First of all, most of us got our start in the church cause you see you started church before you started school.  And the, so you got started in the Sunday school and you worked your way all the way up into junior deacons and it was very much a part of what we did as we grew up.  And for my family, they wasn't, until my mother [Lille Mae Coleman joined what we called the quote, unquote "sanctified church", it wasn't as strict, but there was an expectation that you would go to Sunday school.  And then you would go to church, and then a lot of activity was centered around the church because a lot of the entertainment you saw was centered around the church because that was the only building in the community where you could have something.  And so, and I was a pretty active little fellow.  Being the oldest child of ten, sort of like the little leader running around in the community; somebody got to take over all these little boys running around being bad.  And so I was pretty well the little leader, self appointed leader.
Story_ID: 29640
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I take it you liked school and you liked that kind of role?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I always had a love for school, including Sunday school, still go to Sunday school.  So I've always had, and I always did pretty good in school.  I mean, you know, my mother [Lillie Mae Coleman] never had to bother me about studying and all this stuff about, I didn't need nobody to tell me to study.  I had an assignment so I did my assignment, and nobody ever said anything to me about it.  My brother right under me was just the opposite.  And my sister next to him was just the opposite.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, did you have any heroes or mentors growing up?
Speaker 2: If you start right in the, out there in the country, it would have Albert Anthony, the man who owned all this land, and he drove a Cadillac and my parents [Johnny B. Wilson and Lillie Mae Coleman], they drove Fords.  And eventually, they switched over to a Chevrolet.  That's another story cause I got blamed for it being out of fix all the time.  But the, then you got your heroes.  We bought, we got our first television set in '56 [1956] and since I was born in '42 [1942].  So we had a television set in '66 [1966]--
Speaker 1: Fifty-six [1956].
Speaker 2: Fifty-six [1956], so then you start getting your heroes on television, but they also had a theater in Columbus [Mississippi].  So as we got to be, and my parents would always go to town each Saturday, and so we would go to the, what they called the picture show, the theater.  And so you had your heroes, you know, the different cowboys, and each one of us had a nickname, that was gonna be one of the cowboys.  I think I was Bob Steele or something like, and everything.  So you had those, but when you, the real heroes was much later on in life.  It was actually when I, and it was by way of television cause I was fully aware that Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] became a hero, much more so or probably sooner than Martin Luther King [Jr.] in terms of the real hero type things.  And I can remember, that's, I can remember the physician then becoming the hero, the black doctor.  So when my parents would ask you what you wanna be when you grow up, and they would do that, not necessarily my parents, but older people.  So they would quite ask me what you wanna do when you grow up?  And it would range everything from a farmer, and I would only say that because I wanted to be like Albert Anthony, and I'd get a lot of folks working for me, making a lot of money, and I'm collecting most of it.  Then I can get rich.  Or I would tell 'em, I wanna be the president of the United States.  Neither one of those was the right answer for them.  One was unrealistic, the other was, you shouldn't wanna be a farmer.  But then I would play with 'em like that.  What I really wanted to be was, I knew I would go to college.  I was pretty good in math and I loved math and science and Sputnik [satellite] came along in what '58 [1958]?
Speaker 1: Fifty-seven [1957], yeah.
Speaker 2: Fifty-seven [1957], and so then the space age had a great impact on my, on what I thought I wanted to be, but it was gonna be some kind of science.
Speaker 1: Okay, so while you were in high school, and it gets to be the early years of high school, you were then a sophomore around there in high school when Sputnik was launched?
Speaker 2: I would have been still in the country in the last year of the eight, first eight years.  I went to high school in '62 [1962]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I mean in '58 [1958], graduated in '62 [1962].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So I would have been in my last year--
Speaker 1: In grade school.
Speaker 2: --in grade school.  And so--
Speaker 1: As Sputnik went up and a lot of talk about the science for a while, I mean in that period, was big on television, a lot of projections about the future.
Speaker 2: And a lot of fear because we was building bombs, we were building bomb shelters, and people was storing up food.  I mean I was fully aware and had fears and very conscious of the kind of world, you know, that we were living in.  My uncle had served in the Korean conflict and he was coming home telling me war stories.  And so the Russians was a big fear to me.  The atomic bomb or some more atomic bombs and the hydrogen bomb which was more powerful than the atomic bomb, and so, and so I would spend a lot of my time envisioning, well how long can you stay in a shelter?  How long will the food last?
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were the questions.
Speaker 2: And so I knew I was going off to college.  I knew would be, I would major in some kind of science.  I knew it was not gonna be biology.  I did not wanna be a medical doctor because my parents used to make me stay with the old, older people who were sick.  So I had been turned off by sickness, like my grandmother was sick, the aunt sick.  You had to babysit the sick.  Well, see I didn't wanna to have any part of anything that had to do with biology and medicine.  I wanted to be, I knew it would be some kind of physical science.  Now, that part I did know.  I didn't wanna be a lawyer, didn't want no part of a lawyer, sort of had a little church thing about it.  It seemed like lawyers could lie either way.
Story_ID: 29641
Speaker 1: Now, were you able to follow the Civil Rights Movement on television in those days?  Did they, in the South, I guess I'm asking, in the South, did they really show Dr. King's [Martin Luther King Jr.] demonstrations in Montgomery [Alabama] in '56 [1956], that was '56 [1956] when it started, the Montgomery Bus Boycott, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they showed it.  Well, we were picking up, we could pick up an NBC station, and then we could pick up another station out of Birmingham [Alabama].  You know you had this antenna out there.  So you couldn't get all the, too many channels way out there in the country in the first place.  So, and we could pull in, but on a regular basis, it was the NBC station.  And then we'd get ABC out of Birmingham on a good night.  So, and I always enjoyed watching the news.  I was gonna watch the news.  So if any news was on the television, I was would watch it.
Speaker 1: And Walter Cronkite was big then.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Walter Cronkite and--
Speaker 1: Huntley and Brinkley, I think on NBC.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and I don't know when I, well, if you're talking about CBS, I probably was in college when we had some real good reception on CBS stations.
Speaker 1: So you had mostly NBC--?
Speaker 2: Right, I think the station, a lot of 'em was NBC stations.  Well, the one out of Birmingham, the clouds have to be right.
Speaker 1: In those days, it was Huntley and Brinkley (unclear).
Speaker 2: Yeah, and so, but what would happen is, they would, they was showing what was going on in Montgomery, and ultimately, maybe by the time it got to Birmingham, I may have been on my way to Montgomery, I was fully aware of Wallace [Alabama Governor George Wallace] and his stand at the University of Alabama.  I mean they showed, I saw all of that, by us having a television.  There wasn't but one television in the country, and my parents [Johnny B. Wilson] had it, and people would come over and sit up at night and take up all your seats and wear out your furniture, and get my favorite spot.  I didn't particularly care a lot about that, but my mother [Lillie Mae Coleman] was real nice.  She'd let 'em come.  But she wouldn't watch television.  She bought one for us though.  She'd be back somewhere reading.
Speaker 1: Now, did she bring a lot of magazines into the house?
Speaker 2: Not really.  She would be reading the bible or reading some books that had been passed down by her daddy [Ed Coleman].  It wasn't, it wasn't really magazines.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you get newspapers at home?
Speaker 2: No, not out there.
Speaker 1: Any of the Northern newspapers?
Speaker 2: No, No.  I don't think.  That's the reason why it was nice when I got a television because now I could hear the news.  Otherwise, you'd have to try to listen to it on radio.  And now, I could really see it.  So even as a child, I appreciated that.
Story_ID: 29642
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, now when you were in high school, did you play any sports?
Speaker 2: We grew up in the country playing baseball.  So I was a pretty good baseball player.  You know, the old folks thought I was real good.  They would say that boy is ready for the majors.  That sound good.  I played third base, tried to pitch, played a little center field.  But so, we grew up out there playing baseball, and I could always hit the ball.  So when I went to high school, I actually played on the high school baseball team.  I went out for football, but see, I didn't even know how to play football because we didn't play football in the country.  So I didn't, after I went out and I decided I didn't wanna be bothered with that.  I probably went to practice one or two times, decided I didn't want to be bothered.  But when I went to college, I went out for football again, actually stayed out there a year, didn't play anything.  Of course, my team didn't win a single game that whole year so it didn't matter, but the baseball was the thing; didn't play any basketball because they played basketball in the city.  We didn't have basketball (unclear) in the country.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you're a leader in high school.  Were you like a student body president or something like that or did you--?
Speaker 2: No, I think I was the home room president once, but you gotta keep in mind, I was a country boy going in the, quote, unquote "town" high school.  And so most of the organized leaders in high school were pretty well manipulated by the school teachers who had daughters and sons going there.  And so they were fully aware of these kind of things so they would point their kids in those directions.  I, I basically just went to high school, got my lesson.  They put me in the shop when I first got there, woodwork, taught me how to build houses, how to lay bricks.  So I got some houses in Columbus [Mississippi] that I've actually built, bricks I've laid.  So, and I stayed in there two years, this, what they call the shop.  They didn't even have me in the college prep.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school and where'd you go?  You went to?
Speaker 2: Hunts.
Speaker 1: Hunts, right.
Speaker 2: So, and so my, the junior and senior year, I had to do a little catching up, and I had to start advising myself.  After the first two years, you're in the shop, and then the second two years, you supposed to do something kind of domestic, whatever.  You go off in the afternoon and go downtown and work.  Well, that's where I parted company with this track.  And I decided I'd go over and start taking all the math they had, and I took the chemistry at the junior year, and I took physics as a senior, in my senior year.  And the highest they had in math was algebra II.  So I took algebra I and then geometry and then algebra II.  So, so I pretty well just decided that I was gonna prepare my own self for college because they was putting me in the domestic track.
Speaker 1: Right.  Now, this is something and a good point maybe that we can make, that you school was a public school--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --even though the principal was Mr. Hunt--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and it's named for him.  But the state actually designed the curriculum for the school, right?
Speaker 2: They designed the curriculum for the school, but we had two, but since I was from the country, they just put, they put me over in the one that was led to getting a job.
Speaker 1: Right, a job of servitude, sort of.
Speaker 2: And it took me, I, as a matter of fact, I'm glad I took the woodwork and bricklaying.  It turned out to be okay.  So I just then started taking extra courses and basically advised myself for the rest of the way.  And so when I came out of the high school and graduated, I had taken everything they had in science and all the English, the highest English that they had.  As a matter of fact, I wasn't even conscious, I was too busy getting my lesson, trying to talk to the girls and trying to be popular and going to the clubs and doing whatever, a little having fun.  I was too, I wasn't even aware that they had actually had a ranking in the class.  When my homeroom teacher told me, you number four, I said, number four for what? (laughter).  I said, man, if I had known they was ranking folks, maybe I could a, I probably would a aimed a little higher than four (laughter).  I wasn't aware of (unclear).  I'm telling you, I was just country.  And he told me you number, you the number four student in the class, I said, oh, number four?  He said, oh, yeah.  And if I had really known that they were keeping track of stuff like that, I probably would have tried to go for number one or two (laughter).
Story_ID: 29643
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were a senior, now who helped you get into college?
Speaker 2: Well, my kinfolk were always fighting over me and my colleges, wanted me to come to Oklahoma.  And my cousin, who went to Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama], my mother's sister's daughter, was a graduate of Alabama State.  So she came to visit one day, and I think I was ending up my sophomore year.  And I came in the house, and she was there visiting with my mom [Lillie Mae Coleman].  And so I gave my mother my report card, and my mother just opened it up and sort of threw it over there on the ironing board.  And my cousin picked it up and said, Bobby, you get grades like this?  Yeah.  And she said, (unclear) aren't you excited about this?  She said, no (laugh).  And so my cousin got real excited.  She said, if you keep this up, when you finish I want you to come to Montgomery, Alabama and stay with me and go to college.  So instead of going to Oklahoma, I decided to go to Montgomery, Alabama.  So I moved in, moved to Montgomery, Alabama, moved in with my cousin and stayed four years, never had a dispute with her husband.  As soon as I got there, they gave me the keys to their car, their (unclear) credit card to buy gas, and I could use the card like it was mine, and they paid for the gas and fed me three times a day, and that was it.
Speaker 1: So did you have to work or anything?
Speaker 2: Un-un, didn't have to work.  The only time I worked was when I would go, I would go off to Michigan each summer and work in the factory and make my summer money.  Then when I came back to college, I had plenty money they would say back in those days.  But see, I didn't have to pay my cousin.  It was better than the scholarship that Mayor Holmes, at Rust College [Holly Springs, Mississippi] or Jackson State [University, Jackson, Mississippi] was trying to offer me in Mississippi because this was a free load.  I paid her, she didn't want anything from me.  She didn't want not a, not a dime.  Matter of fact, she gave me a credit card to use to buy the gas to put in her car, and all I did was wash the car off every weekend and made sure I went to get an oil change when it was time.
Story_ID: 29644
Speaker 1: Now, what was Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama] like in the fall of 1962?
Speaker 2: Very exciting.  I remember arriving on the campus my first day, and I had on a red, what they called red banlon shirt, some black pants, some red sox and some black shoes. I thought I was sharp (laughter).
Speaker 1: And you were.  In 1962, that was sharp.
Speaker 2: So the, just the idea of being on a college campus with having all these new friends and hooked up with--the first friend turned out to be a math major, and he finished in math.  And, of course, I finished in chemistry.  Then you can go to your second, and the, this, the college setting was so different.  And then I a little, what I thought was free time, and you could socialize a whole lot more because you didn't have to just socialize during lunch.  You could socialize all through the day because you had these gaps where you were in and out of classes.  I enjoyed the teachers.  They had a class they called bio-social which was the first science course where they tried to teach you the biological science mixed in with the social science part.  It was like a five-hour course so you could become a more sociable individual and at the same time learning biology and the biological part of you.  I thought that was quite different.  I'm not sure, we don't do it like that anymore, but I sort of enjoyed that because I learned a lot.  Then on the other hand, we had something they called integrated arts, another five-hour course.  And that was the course that sort of helped me a lot because, being from the country, I was a little rough.  And some of the finer things in life, I didn't (unclear) have a great appreciation for and not, whenever I needed to.  So they took care all that at the freshman level.  So you, in other words, I had to take, music was a part of it, drawing, art was a part of it, dance was a part of it.
Speaker 1: Did you have any of the arts in high school at Hunts [High School, Columbus, Mississippi]?
Speaker 2: Not really because I'm still making up to try to get all the science I can get after finishing the first two years where I'm in this industrial art track.  So what I remember from high school was the literature I was good at because I had an excellent high school teacher, and I got an excellent background.  So by the time I finished, I could quote Julius Caesar's speech, Mark Anthony's speech, and I could quote--and played around with it all the time with the girls, "Song of Tesela" (ph.) and some of your, the literature, any, especially the part that had a lot of, lot of love stuff in it, you know, like sweet stuff and talk (unclear) (simultaneous), I could impress the girls.
Speaker 1: Can you remember any of that now?
Speaker 2: Yeah, stuff like "drinking only with thine eyes, and (laughter) and I would leave the kiss upon the cup and I would not ask for wine" and that kind of stuff.  "Jail, stonewalls does not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage", I mean I knew all of those.  And I could, I knew Caesar's, Mark Anthony's speech and Brutus which was quite long.  And so, outside of the literature part, the dance, the appreciation for decorating, how to, I mean they taught us all that as a freshman.  So when you finished that course, you really was a more well rounded individual, the appreciation for music, for the classics, all of that was done as a part of course.  You had about five different teachers and they compiled into one single grade for the course, and it was a five-hour course.  And so we could tease each other because some of us was a little better at things than others.  And, of course, the bio-social part, well, those people who weren't necessarily into science, they could deal, they could deal when we went to the integrated arts part, they probably did better, but those of us who was in science, we did better on the bio-social.  And so and I developed some real good friends and, of course, the Civil Rights Movement was going on.  So we were heavily involved in that.  And those were the days when we would have these, what we called "sit-in's" or "sit-out's" or whatever.  I'm not sure what we called them, but that's where you left the dormitory and everybody went and sat out on the grass and refused to live in the dormitory protesting.  And the last thing you wanted to find out is, man, you done had all them girls out there sitting down, and I just found out this morning (laughter).  Why didn't somebody tell me last night (laughter)?  But, and then they also was marching in Montgomery [Alabama], and this incident where they had the horses and was going around beating people off of the horses, that was right down from the school.
Speaker 1: Oh, in Montgomery?
Speaker 2: In Montgomery.  And we did well and enjoyed our classes, the algebra.  My first year in college was pretty easy because I had a good background from high school.  So most of the stuff that they were teaching I already knew it, especially the science and math.  I already knew chemistry and I already knew physics.  I already knew math.  I didn't have to worry about studying too hard until it started my sophomore year.  And then it started getting into the college stuff, so now I gotta learn some new stuff.  So I enjoyed it and we had a good time.
Story_ID: 29645
Speaker 1: Okay, now, who is, are any of the civil rights leaders still on campus [Alabama State University, Montgomery, Alabama] or around the campus in those days?  I know that, well, there were some people on the campus that helped with the Montgomery Bus Boycott.  Was E. D. Nixon still in town?  Did you ever have a chance to meet him or Ralph Abernathy or Rosa Parks?
Speaker 2: Well, less--the answer is sort of yes and no, not necessarily like the two of us chatting.  My wife had relatives who lived right around the street from Rosa Parks.  Ralph Abernathy was actually my frat brother, I think.  And so I only met him in the sense that he came into town to speak or something.  I happened to have been in the audience, but not--that generation was a little older than me.  So they were upfront, and the rest of us was sort of in the back, basically spectators cause we were, we still did a lot of concentrating on making sure we were on campus in class.  We wasn't necessarily downtown if it meant we had to cut classes.
Speaker 1: How did the school administration deal with sit-in's and marches and things?
Speaker 2: Well, it turned out that Alabama State was in a transition anyway.  It was transitioning from the Trenholm family who was there when I went in '62 [1962] to [Levi] Watkins who came in, in '63 [1963] to trans, to take over the university.  So the Trenholms was a well-established family in Montgomery [Alabama], Trenholm that, Trenholm Hall, Trenholm this.  It was just the Trenholms had control of the university for many, many years.  Watkins then was transitioning in, and he came in out of Tennessee.  So--
Speaker 1: He was the new president?
Speaker 2: The new president, the one that actually signed my degree.  So because of the Trenholms and their stature in the community and having been there all those years, we didn't, there was not a whole of lot of things negatively associated with the university.  In other words, they were very, relatively patient with the sit-in's or the sit-out's or whatever, and they eventually got the students back in the dormitories.  There was not, I don't even know of any incidents on our campus, any negative incidents like, if you come to Texas Southern, they had some shooting in the dormitory.  We didn't have any of that at Alabama State.  It was a, around the campus, it was mostly somewhere between the campus and down, and the capital.
Speaker 1: I just wondered if, since it is a state school and it was segregationist state, if the Wallace, George Wallace [Alabama governor] administration tried to put pressure on the school to keep you all from demonstrating or doing anything to agitate?
Speaker 2: I think Wallace was pretty, so busy dealing with the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, that he probably--and the Trenholms, and their politics and kind of longevity they had had around, I think that probably, in my opinion, kept us more--well, I'll put it like this, kept more order on the campus than anything else.  Now, Watkins, when he was brought in, I, after reading some of the newspaper clippings and stuff much later on, as a matter of fact, since I moved to Houston [Texas], and when I went back and read the commitment that Wallace made to Watkins, to Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama], I'm talking about the funding commitment he brought in there.  And when I went back and read his commitment on what he wanted him to do and the resources he was gonna give him to go out and recruit faculty to make that a top quality school, I was very impressed.  So at the same time he was standing up trying to keep us out of the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama], he did make a commitment cause I read it, to give Watkins whatever he needed to make Alabama State a first-class university.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: And I think Watkins rode in on that commitment and by him being new, and Trenholm, facing Trenholm, he had one year overlap, I think, with Trenon, President Trenon.  And so that's what we were watching.  Even as a first, second-year student, we had, we were sophisticated enough to sort of watch the transition from the Trenon family over into the Watkins control of the university.  And so things went pretty smoothly on the campus.
Story_ID: 29646
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned earlier, a devastating effect, I think it was off-camera, and we weren't rolling yet, of the assassination of [President] John F. Kennedy in the fall of 1963, November 23, '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: Right.  Now, that was a very sad day on Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama] campus.  For some reason, there was a confidence level that we had as students in Kennedy.  Never having met the President as such, but just off of statements that he had made, that we knew that we were all right as long as Kennedy was there.  So when he got, when he was assassinated, it just took a lot out of all of us.  And, of course, we're also dealing with--we're in Alabama, and we got Wallace [George Wallace] as the governor.  And (laughter) so, and I hadn't read the letters of commitment.  But even at the, even after reading the letters of commitment, it still showed that he was, on the one hand he was trying to make sure that he kept this separate but equal thing, and he was trying to make sure that the money was there to back it up, at least I learned that from the letters.  But he was dead set on segregation now, segregation forever.
Speaker 1: Yeah, (unclear) "lips dripping with the words of nullification."
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter).  And so later on, losing King [Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.], but I think we were more devastated cause we was a lot younger, and we were in a very delicate period.  We're in Alabama, we're youngsters, and you shoot the president of the United States.
Story_ID: 29647
Speaker 1: So, now, to chemistry, for a second.  When did you first conceive of yourself as becoming a chemist?
Speaker 2: Actually, as I said, I knew I would be a scientist, math or science.  Dr. McDonald came in as part of [Levi] Watkins' recruitment of quality folk.  He passed a few months ago.  Matter of fact, he was chairman of the Department of Chemistry here at TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas]  when I came.  And so he came out of UT [University of Texas, Austin] with a Ph.D. in chemistry in 1962.  So he was over at Alcorn [State] University [Lorman, Mississippi].  So Watkins recruited him and brought him to Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama].  And we was standing in these lines for registration--this is how it happened, how I got into chemistry.  And these long lines, you know, back in those days, you could stand in line for days.  Now, these long lines and so a bunch of us in the biology line and I looked up and saw there was another line up there, and wasn't nobody in the line.  So my three little buddies, two, the three of us said man, let's go up here and get in this short line.  We walked up to Dr. McDonald and told him we wanted to register.  And he said, you know, this is the chemistry.  We're registering chemistry majors.  So we told him, okay, we wanna be chemistry majors then.  So he asked us about our math grades.  So when we told him, and this was our second year.  See, this was our second year in college.  So he asked about the math grades.  And once we told him the math grades, he said, yeah, you'll make a good chemistry major.  So the three of us signed up, and we all graduated three years later with chemistry, as chemistry majors.  I could have very well stayed in the biology line.  I could have gotten in the math line.  I really wanted to major in physics, but they didn't have a physics major.  I enjoyed physics a lot more in high school than I did chemistry, but because I just loved, physics was just nice.  But, but they didn't have a physics major.  So the three of us chose chemistry, and we got in that line and we became, that was the Class of '66 [1966] as chemistry majors, Wilson, James and Walker.
Speaker 1: Okay, did you have a sense of any other black chemists, I mean that you could aspire to be like in those days?
Speaker 2: At the time that I was in college, not really.  Dr. McDonald became the model.  Here it is, a twenty-eight year old, African, black man with a Ph.D. from the University of Texas in chemistry.  So then he becomes the model.  And he then, many evenings and afternoons, we, I would just go to his office, and he'd sit there and tell me about his experience at UT.  And, and then he would tell me that I was smart enough to be a chemist, a Ph.D. chemist.  And so then he would tell his war stories, and then so, we just, it was often that I'd get trapped in his office in the afternoon and we'd sit there and talk.  And so then he becomes the model, the model chemist because, to be very frank, outside of, not a person, but watching television growing up in Mississippi, they had something called "DuPont Show of the Week".  So that was the first place I heard anything about chemistry, "better living through chemistry".
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: And the only other place I heard it was watching television.  There was a commercial for Borax 20-mule team [cleaning solution]--
Speaker 1: Mule team.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so those are my first experience with anything about chemistry.  And that was prior to going to high school.  That was after getting a television in 1956 and watching these shows.  But then when I got on the campus and they brought McDonald, if Alabama State hadn't brought folk in like McDonald in '63 [1963], I wouldn't be a chemistry major cause they didn't even have a chemistry major on the campus.  He started the chemistry major.  And I was at Alabama State so I was gonna major in something.  And it turned out that we got in the short line and that was it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, that's an interesting story.  (Laughter)  It's just a matter of the shorter line.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 29648
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned off-camera too before we started that you went to Selma [Alabama].  Well, you marched to Montgomery [Alabama] from Selma?
Speaker 2: Actually, I did not march.  We were in class.
Speaker 1: Oh, you just went out to the--
Speaker 2: Right.  We, see, when they came in that evening, they stopped out on 82 at St. Jude Campus, St. Jude Hospital, St. Jude Catholic School.  It's a private school, church, hospital.  So they stopped on the campus of St. Jude.  And that's where all the performances were played.  So that was on the west side of Montgomery.  And I lived sort of down on, over on the east side of Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama]. So we actually drove over there that night with all the rest of the crowds where they had all the speakers.  And then they were there, I think after that, that led to the march on the capital and Martin Luther King [Jr.] spoke.  I'll be very frank with you.  I didn't leave the campus.  I was still on campus, in class.  I probably should have been down there, but I wasn't standing on the steps.  I was listening to it on the radio.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So things are changing in Montgomery, you know, all during the time that you're in school.  It's a time for a lot of social change in the city of Montgomery?
Speaker 2: Yeah, while I'm in school, things are changing.  First of all, when I went to Alabama State, the university was unaccredited.  It had lost its accreditation.  That's the, thus, the change in the presidency.  Even though [Levi] Watkins was very old and probably held on to the university a little too long, and this commitment was made to get the accreditation back.  So I watched Alabama State become a stronger university.  So my third year I started seeing the strength, the best teachers that he could find out there, physics.  He brought in Calbot (ph.).  McDonald in chemistry, Olivia in biology.  So, and there's some more folks in math, and so they start strengthening these programs.
Speaker 1: Now, did you--
Speaker 2: So I watched the university get strong and at the same time, I watched the city calm down.
Speaker 1: Now, do you think that the challenge by students trying to integrate the University of Alabama [Tuscaloosa, Alabama] had something to do with George Wallace [Alabama governor] trying to strengthen Alabama State, which is, was their black college?
Speaker 2: I know it did.
Speaker 1: Yeah, cause I guess--
Speaker 2: I know it did because see what happened is, if Ala--he fooled around and allowed Alabama State to lose its accreditation.  He can't argue separate but equal and you allow one of your two HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] to lose accreditation, and especially one in the state capital.  So the commitment was made, and they actually fixed the problem.  They fixed it.  I actually watched and experienced, I was a part of the fix.  So when I graduated in 1966, my degree was from an unaccredited university.  My wife graduated in '67 [1967] and hers was accredited, from an accredited university.  It took time to get the accreditation back.
Speaker 1: How did it affect you going to graduate school coming out of (unclear) (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: When I went to Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan] I went to Michigan State on probation automatically.  But I was a part of the fixing, which means I was in pretty good shape because I was a person that was being treated by the fix, the good folks that was brought in to make it better, I experienced them.  So I guess the first year was the turning point cause that fall, Watkins rolled in there--Watkins actually came in '62 [1962] and had a transition to take over in '63 [1963].  So he spent that first year bringing his faculty in.  Yeah, that's the way it was.  So '63 [1963], the faculty was there.  He was actually was there, but he was sort of invisible because Trenholm was president.  And as a freshman, I, maybe the deans and politicians knew what was going on.  We didn't have no way of knowing.  It was probably the latter part of the year before we figured out that we had Watkins there in transition.
Speaker 1: Now, did you pledge Kappa when you were Alabama State?
Speaker 2: Pledged in November of '63 [1963].  Pledged each fall.  You couldn't pledge the first of the year so you had to wait till your second year, second, third or fourth year to pledge.  So I passed in '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now--
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: No, I was trying to go back to say, I watched Montgomery change and after watching Alabama State become better, I watched Alabama become, Montgomery become better.  But I had to watch a lot longer to see Montgomery become a lot better because they was still dead set on separate but equal, segregation and when I finished Alabama State, I taught high school at Booker Washington [Booker T. Washington High School, Montgomery, Alabama], which is right up the street from Alabama State.  And I stayed--
Speaker 1: So you didn't go right away to Michigan State?
Speaker 2: No.  And so it was my, and I taught senior-level classes, senior home room.  And I think it was three years of teaching that I saw my first student from university, from Booker Washington go and enroll at the University of Alabama.  So even when I finished in '66 [1966], the high school students still couldn't go to the University of Alabama.  I was, I taught three years, and I think the third class, I remember they recruited some of those to go up there cause they had BABS (unclear) scholarships.  And so after, and then it, right now, it, as you, as time passed, the city of Montgomery is a pretty decent city.  But it took a lot longer than fixing Alabama State.
Speaker 1: Were there incidents on the buses in Montgomery when you got there?  I mean after the bus boycott and the supposed integration, I would think that had to be solved?
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was solved.  They had integrated the buses.  The only incident would have been that last attempt to intimidate the community when they were riding around on horses and whipping folk and chasing 'em up and down the street.  The students from the East Coast and Midwest and various places came in and all that happened around '62 [1962], '63 [1963].  And we went through the stage where we had a lot of students down there, they had taken a semester away from Penn State [Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania] or somewhere else.  And they were all down there in Montgomery.  And once they left, things settled down and there was no more, there was nothing about, there were no incidents about buses.  People just sort of started accepting the reality, the new reality.
Story_ID: 29649
Speaker 1: Okay, now how did you manage to enroll in Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan]?  I mean did you, did any of your professors help pave the way for that?
Speaker 2: Actually, I taught high school at Booker [T.] Washington High School in Montgomery [Alabama].  And one physics course and probably two or three chemistry classes, sections.  I taught all the physics and all the chemistry, chemistry to the juniors, physics to the seniors.  And they closed Booker Washington down as a high school.  They built a brand new high school across town.  It was nice cause it had air conditioning, called Jefferson Davis [High School, Montgomery, Alabama].  And they needed a physics teacher, and I did my student teaching at Carver High School under Mrs. Hardy who was the chemistry and physics teacher over there.  I think they sort of wanted her, but she was a lot older, a little older, she was a lot older than me.  And she wanted to stay at Carver.  She recommended that they get me, said they was closing Booker Washington down anyway.  I think that's how it happened.  She rec, the one that recommended.  So then they came over, the assistant superintendent actually came over and asked me if I'd taken the job.  And so I wind up getting transferred over to Jeff Davis to teach physics.  And after one year of teaching at Jefferson Davis and to be very frank, it wasn't enough integration.  I think I taught two African Americans, period out of three or so sections of physics.  And so I decided I would go back to graduate school and try to teach at an HBCU [Historically Black Colleges and Universities].
Speaker 1: Okay.  We'll pause here.
Story_ID: 29650
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about, so you applied to graduate school?  You--?
Speaker 2: Went over to Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama], look out on the bulletin board, pulled me some of these little cards off where you can apply, write to graduate school about an application.  And I sent about a handful of those off, Howard [University, Washington, D.C.], Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], three other schools.  And I got, then they sent me applications, and then I had to pay the money to apply.  So I wind applying to about three.  Michigan State was one of those.  I applied Howard, I know was the other.  I'm not sure, maybe Marquette [University, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] (unclear).  I went to Michigan State mainly because the letter that they wrote me accepted me and the conditions and the offer they made me in terms of assistantship was better.  They told, I basically got a simple letter saying that we will support you for five years, cause they didn't know, I didn't have a master's.  We will support you for five years as long as you maintain a 3.0 and made reasonable progress towards your degree.  And they told me what it would be.  It wasn't but 275 dollars a month.  But they also explained that, married housing, cause I was married, married housing was only 125 dollars a month, and that included all utilities.  So I could do the math and figure out I could make it.  So I accepted the position and went to Michigan State, and if I had to do it all over again, I'd do it the same way.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, was Robert Green at Michigan State then, Dr. Green?
Speaker 2: Dean Green.  Yes, Dean Green was there.  It turned out that it was a great department, and I ran into some folk that didn't think I was there, should have been there.  I wasn't really all that, I wasn't concern--I wasn't even all that knowledgeable about what we call, what they call it?  Quotas and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Affirmative Action.
Speaker 2: Affirmative Action stuff.  I wasn't even aware of that.  I just applied.  They made me an offer; I went.  I only found out about the financial aid arrangements and all this kind of stuff when I got over awarded.  I was in graduate school, working, and then they needed someone to tutor for the nursing school.  And I accepted the job tutoring for the nursing school.  Next thing I knew, they sent me a letter saying I had been over awarded.  Over awarded, what?  (Laughter)  But I guess in applying and in them packaging the deal, you do these financial aid papers.  So I had, I didn't get no loan, but whatever they were giving me, it was tied into the financial aid.  And therefore, they had to set a limit.  That's when I became aware of the fact they had a such thing as financial aid.  So that's how I wind up at Michigan State.
Story_ID: 29651
Speaker 1: So how was the experience there?  Was it a good experience?
Speaker 2: It was so good until I had a little nephew, my sister's son that finished Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] in 1995.  He went to the same department and got his Ph.D..
Speaker 1: Now, what, I guess, subject in chemistry did you concentrate on and what area of chemistry did you concentrate on?
Speaker 2: I'm a, what they call an inorganic chemist.  That's, I did my research in inorganic chemistry.  Right now, I'm more of an environmental chemist because it just, it's a little bit more research money available for schools like TSU [Texas Southern University] in environmental chemistry and environmental science.  So we go with the money.
Speaker 1: Okay, so what was your dissertation about?
Speaker 2: Actually, you call it, I was just basically a synthetic chemist, just make stuff for this jar, making and it has no use.  You just make it, synthesize it.  And so I had some niobium compound and that I prepared.  They turned out to be air sensitive so I had to do all of my work in a glove box and handle all of my, all my solvents had to be dried.  And when you say "dried", to make sure they didn't have any water in 'em.  If I was using, let's say, benzene, I had to dry the benzene to make sure it didn't have traces of water in it because all my compound was sensitive to water and air.  And so I did my work in a glove box, enjoyed making my compounds.  And my nephew went up and got his Ph.D. in organic chemistry which is, he turned out, he fell in love with organic.  And his work was designed to make sure that it had some use cause he did work that, where they designed compounds to make drugs so that they could treat illness.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, but mine was just purely knowledge for the sake of knowledge.  I just could say I'm the only one in the world with this.  This is the only piece that exists.
Speaker 1: Well, is there like a hidden reward in this if you would discover something, some inorganic compounds that had never been discovered before?
Speaker 2: Well, it turns out that those of us who just make stuff to say that we make and this is the only thing of its kind in the world, then you publish the material.  People know about it in the literature.  Every once and a while, they'll find a use for it.  Now, it turned out that I hadn't found no real use for the niobium compound that I made, but because I made the niobium compound and got involved with some, what we call ligands, some other material that's associated with niobium, I was able to use those, use metals other than niobium to do catalyst, to liquefy coal.  And so I did some of that work at TSU.  I actually went out to Exxon Research and Engineering in '82 [1982] on a sabbatical, stayed about fifteen months out there and wind up with a couple of patents.  But I was still using the same kind of compound, not niobium, but other metals with the same kind of material that I was making the niobium compound.  And it turned out that I could make, they, you could improve the coal liquefaction.  And then I had a reactor that I bought and set that up.  And I got a grant from DOE [Department of Energy], came back to the campus, and I started making, doing that work on campus and a couple of, three graduate students get master's degrees.
Story_ID: 29652
Speaker 1: Now, when you finished your Ph.D. at Michigan State [University, East Lansing, Michigan], did you come right to TSU [Texas Southern University]?
Speaker 2: Right, I finished in June, took a job here and reported--
Speaker 1: Was that June of, like sixty--
Speaker 2: June '76 [1976].
Speaker 1: Seventy-six [1976], okay.
Speaker 2: And reported to duty here [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] July 16.  But by that time, Dr. McDonald had left Alabama State [University, Montgomery, Alabama], stopped by Southern [Texas Southern University] and taught a while, and worked his way back to Texas Southern cause he got, he received his master's from Texas Southern.  That's where he wanted to come, he wanted to wind up.  And, of course, he was a Texan, so he wanted to get back to Texas.  So he was the chairman of the department now at Texas Southern, when I'm coming out of graduate school.  And they needed an inorganic chemist cause the TSU chemistry department is certified by the American Chemical Society, so you have to have the different people in the areas of chemistry for coverage in order to keep your certification.  So they were short an inorganic chemist.  So I was coming out, I was an inorganic chemist.  So I took the job.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Speaker 2: If I had to do that all over again, I'd do the same thing there.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: I don't regret one day of having come here.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you've been at TSU basically ever since except for the sabbatical you took to work with (unclear) (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: And the sabbatical is not considered, it's still at TSU because all the business is the same, continued.  You just on leave.  I took a second sabbatical or second leave and went to the National Science Foundation.  So those are the only times I've been away from the university, but I still had my benefits through the university.
Speaker 1: Okay, and the leave for the National Science Foundation was in 1995, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, it would have been February of '95 [1995] when I left.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And nineteen months later I returned in August.
Story_ID: 29653
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, I forgot to ask other Dr. Wilson about this and I bemoaned it afterwards.  But tell me about the development of the Association for Black Chemists.  It's got another name, but I know black chemists formed an association that's very important, right?
Speaker 2: We just call it NOBChCE because it's a little catchy, but it's the National Organization of Black Chemists.  It really never changed its name.  We got, we came out with a shorter version.  It's National, the National Organization of Black, for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers.  That's the long name.  National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers.  And then for short we called it, if you, that would translate into what we call NOBChCE.  And so most people just say NOBChCE or they just say the black chemists.
Speaker 1: Oh, were you on the, were you one of the founding members?
Speaker 2: No, no.  NOBChCE was founded in 1972.  And so the founding fathers of NOBChCE would have been people in, along Dr. McDonald's age.  I was in graduate school.  And Bill Jackson out at University of California, Davis, is one of the founders and he still works with the organization on some of the committees.  But, so he would have been along there with Dr. McDonald, in that group.  McDonald was not a founder.  He became a founder of the Houston [Texas] chapter, and the Houston chapter was the first chapter.  And we founded this chapter in seventy--it probably was '78 [1978] or '79 [1979] when we actually got the chapter chartered, but we were raising, we did a lot of the politicking to get chapters, formations at the meeting here in Houston in 1978.
Speaker 1: Okay.  The organization basically, what is it basically for?
Speaker 2: It's an organization sort of similar to the American Chemical Society, basically the same kind of set up.  We gather, we do professional development.  We present papers.  We have students present presentations.  So it's more along the same goals except we include chemical engineers as a part of, or anybody could really be a member, but the concentration is there.  And so we publish, you know, the proceedings and we have awards.  We have scholarships that's sponsored by the various groups.  Isiah Warner would have probably been, has had more involvement in NOBChCE based on the people you interviewed, than Ray [Wilson].  Ray has not been very much involved in NOBChCE.  TSU [Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas] campus, like I said, I was the original chair.  I've been on the board.  Dr. McDonald was on the board a while, and now I serve as chairman of the executive board.
Story_ID: 29654
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you've held many positions.  You rose from assistant professorship all the way to chairman of the department, and then you started taking on other roles at the school--
Speaker 2: Not necessarily in that order though.
Speaker 1: Oh, not in that order?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Not necessarily in that order.
Speaker 1: Okay, well,--
Speaker 2: My professor ranks, I rose from assistant professor to associate and then professor.  And if Dr. McDonald, if you were interviewing him, he would say I did it faster than any, that I actually did it, when he used to introduce me, be bragging because I'm his student, you did, Wilson did it faster than anybody I've ever seen.  But anyway (laughter), and then I was called over and asked to be associate dean first.  And then I went from associate dean to chair.  Then I was called back over to be an interim dean.  And after serving as interim dean for nine months, I was called down here to the president's office, (unclear) he called me in here in 1990.  And that's when we discussed pro, which was then vice president of academic affairs.  And so the board then made me vice president of academic affairs.  Then they, after serving for about a year, year and a half as vice president of academic affairs, they changed it to provost so they could put more responsibility up under the title.  So I became, I'm actually the first provost TSU [Texas Southern University] ever had.  And then I left the office and came back in '99 [1999], left in ninety, December of '93 [1993] and came back in '99 [1999] for my second term as provost.
Speaker 1: Now, what did you do in the interim?
Speaker 2: They changed presidents so I went back to the chemistry department.  And actually, when I got back there, they voted me in as chair.  So I actually went back and chaired.  I went from provost to chair.  And I chaired for a few, a year or so.  That's when I took leave and went to NSF [National Science Foundation] on a sabbatical.
Speaker 1: In '95 [1995]--
Speaker 2: And then I came back as, took up, took over as chair, and then I reapplied for the provost job under a different president and then I wind up in '99 [1999] being made president, provost, October 15, 1999.
Speaker 1: Now, is it administration as interesting or exciting as being a chemist?
Speaker 2: Well, let's put it like this.  It can be a whole lot more exciting (laughter).  But it's, I've always been both.  Even though I'm in the administration, I've never, I've always kept a lab.  I had a student to get a Ph.D. under me this morning.  I had come down off the hood to herd my students.  So they had three Ph.D.s in the program and one of them was my student.  And so I've always kept my hands in the teaching part.  And so it's, so when I leave and go to the science building, it makes me feel sort of nice, you know, to get away from the administration, get to visit a few, an hour or just a few minutes, just walking through the building, different kind of feeling.  The nice thing about the provost's office is that if the presidents that I work with, they have allowed me to at least try to build something.  So if I don't get the faculty in place and if I don't get the programs in place, and move the academic agenda, it's my fault.  And if you look at it like this, if you had an opportunity to try to do it yourself, that's probably better off than someone else having to do it for you.  And so I have watched the development of the university.  I've seen the ups and the down's, but in spite of all that might be happening to Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] right now, when I look at the faculty and when I look at the students, and when I know the quality of the faculty that is coming here to, still coming here to work, and the quality of the students that's going out the door, then I know that the place is okay.  And I know that if I put my time in and my thoughts in, and if I can try to carry out some kind of vision consistent with the president's vision.  And if the president gives me the resources and allow me to do it, which I've fortunately had the blessing of the presidents that have been here the longest, the one that I worked under before and most of my work this time was under Dr. Slate (ph.), I've had the latitude to build a faculty and to put in a whole lot of new programs.  Ph.D. in environmental toxicology was the first round.  That was the first PhD. at the university.  Since I've been back in here, we've put in about three more.
Story_ID: 29655
Speaker 1: And so a chemistry Ph.D. actually was the first one in the (unclear)?
Speaker 2: It's really, we, a Ph.D. in environmental toxicology housed in the chemistry department. It, we had to pick something that's gonna be unique and needed rather than just duplicate something else that they're doing across the street at the University of Houston [Texas].  And so there was a need for us to be able to grant a Ph.D. in science, but it wasn't necessarily one that needed to be in chemistry.  So we did it in a disciplinary way, and it has to have a house, a department to house it in.  The state recommended we house it in, chemistry based on the strength of the faculty in chemistry.  But we utilized faculty, biologists, pharmacy and all over the university to carry out the program.  And so that was the very first Ph.D. degree program on this campus.  And since the second time around, I've been involved in the development of three other Ph.D.s.  One will start this fall, programs.  And so, yeah, I'm not the only one, of course, that could get some of these things done, but I just happen to be the one that's in the position to get 'em done at TSU [Texas Southern University] right now.  And I shouldn't, I'm proud that I'm in that position, and I'm gonna do the best that I can to get the job done.  I always been the kind of a person that like to, for folk to at least think that I would get it done.  Ain't no such thing as getting it half done or getting out there half way and then, well, we can't make it.  That's not my attitude.  We promised the state that we would put these programs in place, and then I will stay up at night as long as it take to get it done.  So when we report in at the end of the period that it's supposed to happen in, that's what, they're gonna be in place.  And the last one will go in place in the fall.  It start, (unclear) classes in the fall.
Speaker 1: Okay, well--
Speaker 2: So the professorship as we go up the line and then when Dr. Harris left the university in February of 1993, then at that stage of the game, in a less high-profile fashion, they sort of turned the university over to me.  We didn't go through all this acting titles changes.  They just transferred signature authority to provost, and so then I graduated a class in the spring, in the summer of '93 [1993].  So that was my first encounter of having to operate more at the president level.  And, of course, this last time, if you looked at my resume, you could see that I've been called as acting president.  And so I've had an opportunity to serve in all the different positions, maybe not for long.  I was interim dean for only nine months, and then they changed it to (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay, well, one of the, I guess, fundraisers are usually the major challenge in running a university.  But what are some of the challenges that you face?
Speaker 2: Well, as a provost, my, I should be raising funds through scholarship route, grantmanship, get you some scholars, write you some proposals, and its plenty enough resources at Washington [D.C.], locally, and elsewhere, and people will actually fund good proposals, good research.  And so that's been my style, was to make sure that TSU participated in fundraising through grantmanship.  As a president, then you got to worry about fundraising through the development office, getting it, going out, putting, you know, soliciting gifts and things of that nature.  But that's not really so much what we do as a provost.  I got to get academic scholars in the faculty positions that can write a proposal, got a resume good enough to influence to give to the university funding through grants.  And that's what I do.
Speaker 1: Is there one particular one that's been the biggest one that you've brought in?
Speaker 2: Well, the biggest grant that I've brought in is the NASA [National Aeronautics and Space Administration] University Research Center which is in its fifth year right now.  That's a six million dollar research center.  Now, that's the biggest grant that I have brought in as a write-out PI that had to head up a team of folks and write a proposal to bring the grant in.  The biggest grant that I've been involved in was another program called, an NIH [National Institutes of Health] program, called RCMI [Research Centers in Minority Institutions].  It doesn't have a lot of meaning to you, and I'm not sure I even know what it stand for.
Speaker 1: RCMI?
Speaker 2: Yeah, research, infrastructure, research centers, RC, research centers?  CMI for minority institutions.  But, now, if you looked on a piece of paper, that would show me as the PI, but that's only because of the position at the time.  It's a positional thing.  The real person that's heading up and doing the work would be Dr. Barbara Hayes over in the College of Pharmacy who is the director, but they require that, in that case, that I would carry that, the PI, but that's, so the biggest one that I've seen come to this campus would have been the RCMI, which, like one year it was 10.7 million dollars, something like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, we're gonna pause here and change tape.

Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, now we always ask this question.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Everybody concerned about the quality of education in the public school system.  And there's no doubt and certainly that would have to be of great concern to me as well.  And I, I'm very concerned on how places like Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], you get more involved in improving the public schools, partnerships with the public schools to try to improve it.  Our kids just not prepared to do college work when they come out of these public schools.  I think we need to fix that.  I'm also concerned as a part of higher education that the government seem to be, even at the state level, pulling back on the level of funding they're really willing to put into the colleges and universities.  They're shifting a lot of the burden on the backs of the students, and if we're not careful, most of African Americans won't even be able to afford a college education if we're not careful.  And so I think that the policymakers need to really look at paying, putting enough resources in to make higher education affordable to African Americans and everybody else.  It's not gonna just be African Americans.  We talk a lot about the lack of minorities going into the science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  And we got to get past just the talk.  We got to put the resources in there cause what I found out is that if you really put the resources there, that you can find the students that are willing to come and study in these fields.  I think that because of the war, there's only so much money to go around, and I'm hoping that this was only delayed because of that.  And as soon as we get some of these other problems resolved, that we can really start concentrating on putting the necessary resources into education.
Speaker 1: Now, is TSU [Texas Southern University] involved in any kind of upward bound program (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: We have a upward bound program on campus, and what we find is that in all the special programs we have where people may have gone out and gotten money through grantmanships, that these kids do well.  We have scholarship programs where people have gotten money to bring resources to the campus to recruit students to put in the STEM fields, those students do well.  But we got to make, we got to involve more people.  We got to be able to reach more people, and that's my concern.  I'm concerned about the role of the HBCUs [Historically Black Colleges and Universities].  We gonna have to see more diversity among HBCUs and we got to see more support for HBCUs.  It's, I realize that we have, HBCUs gonna have to reach out to all people so they can become diverse.  But we need the resources so that we can maintain quality, so that people get a good solid education and can go out and compete.  Now, I know that there're some special things about an HBCU that certain people will fair a lot better there than they will somewhere else.  But some people will fair better at [University of] Notre Dame than they will somewhere else or some people will, because it's not just the HBCUs.  Some people just fit better in a private Catholic school than they would somewhere else.  So we need everybody cause we've got a massive problem.  And we just need to fix the public schools so that everybody can get a good student coming into the college, into college work.  Now, right now, because this seem to be a greater problem for minorities when you just look at the numbers and look at the test scores, we just need, it's a bigger problem.  We need to put more money in there and fix the problem.  And what I'm talking about is that, if you look at the number of students that are failing the tests to get you into college or you look at the number of students that are in the, what, in the poor inner-city high schools, they're dominated by minorities in Houston [Texas] and most of the large cities.  I was up on the East Coast and they say it was even worse in some of the cities up on the East Coast.

Speaker 1: You're the recipient of many awards and honors, what are some of the ones that mean the most to you?
Speaker 2: The award that means the most to me is the, well, I could probably get myself in trouble.  But within the fraternity, we have a very high award that's been associated with achievement in your field.  It's not, it's supposed to be an award that recognizes people who have achieved in their field, the Laurel Wreath Award of Kappa Alpha Psi.  They've given out fifty-eight of those awards since 1911.  I hold number fifty-eight, so it's very special to me.  I received the NOBChCE Teacher of the Year award.  That's very special to me.  I received the Texas Southern University Teacher of the Year award.  I received the Texas Southern University Researcher of the Year award.  All those are very, very special.  Now, a plenty other things floating around on the walls, but I think those four would be at the top of my list.
Speaker 1: Okay, involved in teaching.  When you look back on everything you've done to this point, is there any major thing that you would do differently now?
Speaker 2: No, I can't say I would because I still enjoy getting up every morning, coming to work.  And anything that I would do different, anything that I think should be done different, is out of my control.  It's nothing on my part that I could do different.  It's some things I would like to see done differently.  It's some things that I would like to have seen not happen.  There have been a few falls that I would have liked to have avoided.  But in terms of doing something different on my part, nah.  I think when I look back on it, I have been blessed and been able to touch a lot of people to do a lot of good for a lot of students.  I've been blessed with resources from Washington [D.C.].  They didn't just drop in my hands.  I had to sit up at night and write proposals to get 'em.  I've been blessed with, to be surrounded by a lot of smart scientists, fellow colleagues who we added to the faculty who I've sort of mentored, and they, we've gotten a lot done together.  And I have helped them, but then they have helped me a whole lot.  I have promoted them, but then they have promoted me a lot.  And all of this promoted Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas].  It made Texas Southern a better place.
Story_ID: 29658
Speaker 1: Okay, well, likewise, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: I think the impact that I've had on science education at Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas] cause they say I'm a little biased.  But I think that when I look back at it, that the impact that we've been able to have on science education in particular, where we worked a little harder to get a few more things in place and resources and fix a few more problems, that that's probably gonna be the greatest.  But then I've had an opportunity to help, as a provost, to help the whole, you know, help everybody.  But some people need more help than others.  For example, the law school dean doesn't need a whole lot of help.  He just need resources.  If he, he's the law school dean, and he knows how to make a great law school.  Or the pharmacy school dean or the business school dean.  But science, the STEM fields, this national problem that we have that we keep talking about and I think I've done something to contribute to making that better at TSU [Texas Southern University].
Speaker 1: Okay, now, tell us something about your family.  Do you have children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I have a son and three daughters, in that order.  I taught my three daughters, no, I taught two of my daughters.  I had two chemistry majors, B.S., chemistry majors out of Texas Southern, my older daughter and my younger daughter; quite different behaviors on who's gonna report to the high authority when they go home, but, and the older daughter, she decided to switch over and do her master's in public health and a Ph.D. in social work cause the younger daughter went on to UC Davis [University of California, Davis] and did a Ph.D. in environmental chemistry and toxicology.  And then the middle one, she also finished Texas Southern, but she majored in communications, went to Columbia [University, New York, New York] and did her master's in nine months in journalism and then went over to the University of Mississippi and did a law degree.  So she's practicing law in Jackson, Mississippi.  My son majored in journalism, but he never finished.  He started out at Prairie View [Agricultural and Mechanical University, Prairie View, Texas], but he later on attended Texas Southern, but he never really finished up the degree.  So that basically represents the kids.  Of course, my older daughter has two little daughters, so I got two granddaughters, and my son has a little son, well, he's not too little.  He's about twelve years old, and my younger daughter has a three-year old and my middle daughter has a one year old son.  So three grandsons, two granddaughters.  That's, pretty well make up my, my family.
Speaker 1: Now, is there anything I haven't asked you that you think that we ought to talk about before I ask my final question?
Speaker 2: We need to just talk about the fact that when you talk about family, and you talk about how the kids may have been successful, I would have to give most of the credit to my wife because I was too busy trying to work my way up through TSU [Texas Southern University], and in some cases trying to do things for Texas Southern when she was there making sure that they got their lesson done at night and teaching them, cause she was a second grade, gifted and talented school teacher in Houston HISD [Houston Independent School District].  And so I have to give her credit for making sure that they were prepared, much more prepared obviously than I was at their age, and probably a whole lot more prepared even after having done Ph.D.s, than I was when I finished doing mine.  Now, it's just a matter of whether they wanna work hard and do something with the degree.  So I had to pause and give her that credit because without that, I may have been a success at TSU and a total failure at home.

Speaker 1: Okay, let me just touch on this for a minute.  We were talking off-camera about different research projects that you were involved in overseas, and then there's one in Egypt where you were testing the content of bottled water in Egypt I think back in the '80s [1980s].  What other projects--
Speaker 2: Actually the biggest project I had in Egypt was doing a whole lot of work in a man-made lake out in the desert where we really did a lot of the work and had funding to go over there.  I've been in and out of Egypt about thirteen times that was associated with those kind of projects.  But I got my first grant in 1970--I guess I wrote the proposal, turned it in, in the spring of '77 [1977] and got funded in '78 [1978] from the National Science Foundation, relatively small grant compared to what we do now.  But that was, that got me started.  Well, actually my first grant was a seed grant from Texas Southern [University, Houston, Texas], my first year after, when I came here.  And I think it was two thousand and some dollars.  And then the proposal to the NSF, and then if you trace through my resume, you'll see where the grants got a little larger.  The first grant was to do those synthetic compounds.  Then after I got, started writing proposals to do work in the environment, then the money got bigger.  And so I've been able to personally keep money, I guess I probably got about eight or nine million dollars worth of current funding under my control, that's current.  And that money, I use to support my graduate students and my undergraduate students and my lab and my post-docs because by being an administrator, I can't be in the lab with them like I need to.  So I have to hire a post-doc to be there on a day-to-day basis to give them the kind of guidance while they work on their master's and or Ph.D. degrees.  So I got plenty grant money, and I always had grant money.  And right now, we're working with a group on a new patent on some nanotube material that we're making here on the campus, headed up by one of these young professors that I've been mentoring.  The money happen to be under my control, but we got about three other individuals and they doing most of the science.  They're doing the work and supervising the students.
Story_ID: 29660
Speaker 1: Okay, well, my last question is similar to legacy, but a little different.  Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, it probably has a shorter answer than what I said.  I want to be remembered as the kind of individual, it be said that this guy if given a job, that he would get that job done and that he really spent a lot of time trying to help people, going out getting grants and trying to find support for students and not only that, but I've done a lot of work in the community.  I do a lot of work in my church.  And I do a lot of work in the black chemist group.  So a helper, someone that's really trying to be helpful, more of, if you went to the bible, it'd just be, just being a servant, just be remembered as being a servant, cause at my age right now, a lot of what I do, I don't really need it.  I, I don't really need a whole lot of anything.  I don't need a whole lot of reputation anymore.  I pretty well, in addition to being on the administrative chain, and working my way up to acting president and provost and all this kind of stuff, I'm also a distinguished professor, L. R. Woods distinguished professor of chemistry, the Shell Oil endowed chair of environmental toxicology, which is a million dollar, it's a little over a million dollar endowed chair out there.  So I'm not, I don't have anything I need to work for.  I've gotten all the promotions I can get.  If I go back to the classroom now, being, I'm an endowed chair.  And I'd have a lot of time to travel and wouldn't have to be worried with all these headaches.  But I choose the headaches because at the end of the day I can see all those young people that somebody may not have put in enough time to listen to their problems, may not even care, and if you listen to the problems long enough, you probably can figure out they got one and if you have authority, you can fix it, if that's the right thing to do.
