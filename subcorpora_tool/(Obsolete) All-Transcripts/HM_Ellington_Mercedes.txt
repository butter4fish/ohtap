Speaker 1: I'll begin by slating.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I'm [HistoryMaker] Harriette Cole, I'm the interviewer for today.  Matthew Hickey is our videographer.  We are interviewing [HistoryMaker] Mercedes Ellington.  I would like--today is August 12--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --two thousand sixteen.  We--I would like for you to say and spell your name, tell us exactly where we are and your birthdate please?
Speaker 2: Okay.  My name is Mercedes Ellington, M-E-R-C-E-D-E-S, like the car, and the last name is Ellington, E-L-L-I-N-G-T-O-N.  We are in my apartment on the Upper West Side on West 92nd Street and Broadway [New York, New York], and I'm on the eighth floor, and I have, I forget what else I'm supposed to say.
Speaker 1: Tell me, what would you say is your title, what do you do?
Speaker 2: Oh, my--my title, when I make up my resume I describe myself as a composer of dances and theatrical situations.  But I want to break it down to being choreographer, director, producer.  And also I do performances now because not only am I involved in the ballroom dance world, but I do performances with my band.  I have a big band, it's the Duke Ellington Center Big Band.  And I create shows and I tell stories, and so those are the types of performances that I do.  And so sometimes I will even get a little bit of a tap dance in.  I've been asked to do a tap workshop in November, which I will do.  I'm not crazy about teaching, I hate teaching, so I--I don't teach.  But--but every once in a while I'll do a--a showcase, you know, just not a showcase, but a workshop.
Speaker 1: And what is your birthdate?
Speaker 2: My birthdate, yes, that's the thing.  February 9, 1939.
Story_ID: 522389
Speaker 1: So I'd like to start with some People magazine type questions.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: What is your favorite color?
Speaker 2: My favorite color used to be i- in the purple family, in the lilac-purple family.  But recently, I've loved that cerise, greenish, you know, bright, and I'm not sure why I went from one side of the rainbow to the other, but I still like purple.  I still like purple.
Speaker 1: Your favorite food?
Speaker 2: Oh I would love to be able to say a pork chop, but I have been away from pork since--well for a long time.  I--I don't eat pork, I--bacon, I miss bacon.  But having said that, my--the closest thing is a lamb chop.  So lamb chops are my favorite, and I also cook sometimes and I'll make spareribs of beef.  So I pretend that the beef is pork, but I fix it just like the pork, but it's beef.
Speaker 1: Your favorite season?
Speaker 2: My favorite, winter.  My fall and winter, the colder climates.  I'm partial to spring sometimes, but really winter is very dramatic for me.  The outs- the weather is dramatic.  The colors of the weather is dramatic.  The clothing is much, I feel, much more interesting.  The textures of the clothing is--is much more interesting in the winter then in the summer.
Speaker 1: Your favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Let's see I have several--I've gone to several places on a pure vacation.  Most of the time it's when I tour or when I travel it's for work purposes, and so I try to combine it with my vacation.  And so, but planned vacations, one of my favorite places is Montecatini [Montecatini Terme, Italy] and Tuscany in Italy.  And the other place is Buenos Aires [Argentina].
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite saying or quote?
Speaker 2: Ah let's see.  I had a friend who lived in Detroit [Michigan] and he was from Detroit and he was a brilliant clothing designer, costume designer, a choreographer, director, his name was Bernard Johnson.  And Bernard was full of these sayings from--from Detroit, things that--one of my favorites is, don't piss in my vest pocket and tell me it's raining outside.  And he also taught me that if I wanted to know what to wear, I don't have to look at the weather report, all I need to do is look out of the window, see what the white people are wearing and put on one more layer.
Story_ID: 522390
Speaker 1: We're going to go to your family now.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I'd love for you to start with your mother.
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Tell me your mother's name, when she was born, where she was from, tell me about her?
Speaker 2: My mom, my--my real birth mother, her name was Ruth Silas [Ruth Silas Batts].  Her name was Ruth Violet Silas.  And she was born and re- raised in New York [New York].  She was a graduate of, I think, Evander Childs [Evander Childs High School; Evander Childs Educational Campus, New York, New York].  She was interested in going into nursing and she did not finish her nursing education.  She became a housewife.  But her--she was also interested in ballroom dancing.  And I have several pictures of her with her club.  They--she formed a club, she helped form a club called the Noiserelles, which in some language means, we sisters.  And they would have ballroom dance gowns on and they would provide the entertainment at the intermissions of their parents' dances.  Because it was a big thing in those days, parents, people went to dances.  They had--they went to ballroom dances and--instead of really, you know, a lot of parties, the parties that we think of nowadays.  That she--she went to my--my grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] and her crew they had held dances at ballroom places like the Savoy [Savoy Ballroom, New York, New York], the Renaissance [Renaissance Ballroom, New York, New York], all these places that were--are in the process of being torn down, if not torn down.  And that was Audubon Ballroom [New York, New York].  There was lots of places that this was the center of the society activities.
Speaker 1: And it was around what time?
Speaker 2: We're talking about '30s [1930s], I--I'm thinking '30s [1930s], '20s [1920s].  And you know, kind of past the flapper stage because I don't remember ever seeing my mom or hearing her talk about the flapper society or things like that.  They were more interested in the ballroom dances like, you know, waltzing and fox trot, and the for--form--formula titles of dances, and not even Latin dances, although I'm sure that they did rumba, cha-cha and all the--those significant things.  And of course 'cause Xavier Cugat and all of those big--so there were a lot of big bands, not only jazz big bands, but Latin big bands that toured.  And radio was popular, so they had the radio to dance to and to practice to.  And then when they went to the actual ballroom events, the bands would--would play for them.
Story_ID: 522391
Speaker 1: And so this is your mother [Ruth Silas Batts] and her friends, or her mother, I'm not sure?
Speaker 2: My mother and her friends, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 2: This is my mother and her friends, because, well my mother was living with my grandmother and my grandfather.  Her--her mother and father, at the time--
Speaker 1: And who--what were their names?
Speaker 2: My mother's mother was Louise Silas [Louise Petgrave Silas], who was from Jamaica, Kingston, Jamaica.  And her father, Alfred Silas was from New Orleans [Louisiana], and he came from a huge family.
Speaker 1: What do you know about his family?
Speaker 2: I knew that they were from New Orleans, that I'm not sure where they--they came from before.  It was rumored that they could've--they could've migrated from Guatemala.  But they came to New Orleans and there was--there were a lot of brothers, I think maybe ten or twelve brothers.  Because on a recent trip when I went there to New Orleans, I tried to find records of his family, but because of all those storms, they've moved all of the records from New Orleans to inland, to the capital [Baton Rouge, Louisiana].
Speaker 1: And do you know what his--what your father's [sic. maternal grandfather] people did, what it?
Speaker 2: Yeah, my--my mother's father was a postal worker, which was a very popular trade at the time.  You were either a teacher or a postal worker or if you didn't ascribe to be a doctor or lawyer, that was kind of out of the range of certain po- certain people and as far as the education that you needed to acquire those skills and to, to be a professional.  But, postal workers were very much revered, and so were teachers.  And so my--my--I remember my grandfather teaching me how to wrap a package. I was fierce at wrapping packages, because at that time they wrapped them with string.  And not only was I a good folder, but it was very, very important to get the paper in the right position and folding things, and getting them to the right shape of the object that you were wrapping.  And that was--that became very important to me.  I don't know why, but I was really completely absorbed in this wrapping packages.
Speaker 1: And do you know what his--how far back can you trace your--his family?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure about his family how far.  As I said it was rumored that they came from Guatemala, but I don't--I had no knowledge of them personally and--or what happened to them or you know, where they ended up.  And my mother--my grandmother from the West Indies, she was an orphan.  So I really don't have any idea where she came from, except that my sis- one of my sisters recently did one of those things--genealogy thing, and she found out that in my--on my mother's side of the family, which is my grandmother from the West Indies, that we were descendent from the Ashkenazi Jewish tribe, so that was a revelation, a recent revelation.
Speaker 1: From your mother's bloodline?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: But you know that her mother was from Jamaica and was an orphan?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea how she got to the United States?
Speaker 2: That's some mystery that we are still trying to find out.  We went to Ellis Island [New York, New York] to try to look up to see if we could find the ship that she came to the U.S. on, and (background noise) we were not--we were not successful at all.
Story_ID: 522392
Speaker 1: What was your [maternal] grandmother's name, your grandmother from Jamaica?
Speaker 2: My grandmother's name was Louise, Louise Silas [Louise Petgrave Silas].  But her maiden name, I think, was Petgrave or Pettigrew, something like that.
Speaker 1: Did she ever tell stories of Jamaica?
Speaker 2: They were funny stories.  But they never really spoke about the--the life in Jamaica.  I--I think that her--her--her cooking was very much the cooking and the recipes and things that she learned when she was in--in the West Indies.  So there was a lot of West Indian food, lots of ox tails and rice and peas, and things that I--she would do things with fish and would--I would never be able to understand.  But she used to make these dishes and she would cook all day.  And it was stews, she was very big on stews.  She made a dish from split pea soup.  She started out with split pea soup but by the time she got finished with it, it was a full meal because she put everything in it, ham hocks and all kinds of stuff, it was just amazing.
Speaker 1: Did she speak with a Jamaican accent?
Speaker 2: Yes, she had an accent.
Speaker 1: So she was probably--she was there long enough to have gained that?
Speaker 2: Yes, but she--and when she came to the states she was very political minded.  She would work on--at the polls.  She would when it--when it became time for voting, she would volunteer to work on the polls and she would make it her duty to find out about all of the details about who was running and what they stood for and everything.  So she was very, you know, she was in--interested in current events, interested in government.  And she was also--because we lived on the ground floor, she was interested in people.  So she would open the window and she'd have a pad where s- for her elbows and she would lean out the window and she'd just watch people go back and forth.  And people used to go by and say hello to her.  And where we lived on Convent Avenue was right down the street from City College [City College of New York, New York, New York].  So there were lots of students who came from the subway on 145th Street and St. Nicholas [Avenue], up the hill, past the window, up to City College.  And also there was a church next door that on Sundays and on--especially Easter Sunday that was her favorite place to sit because she would watch all the fashions and all the hats and things like that.
Story_ID: 522393
Speaker 1: And you lived with your [maternal] grandparents (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, I lived with my grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas].
Speaker 1: With your grandmother?  Was it grandmother and grandfather [Alfred Silas] or?
Speaker 2: Well, yes with the two of them.
Speaker 1: Two of them.
Speaker 2: With my grandmother and my grandfather, we had a five-room apartment in the building on Convent Avenue right next door to where Alexander Hamilton's house used to be, because now his house is in the park down the st- down the hill.  But we lived on about 142nd Street, between 142nd and 141st [Street] and Convent, next door to that was Alexander Hamilton's house, next door to that on the corner was this big beautiful church.  I mean, there's churches all around, and down the hill on 141st Street was another big, big church, St. James [St. James Presbyterian Church, New York, New York], I think.
Story_ID: 522394
Speaker 1: And, before we go to your father's [Mercer Ellington] family, let's stick--
Speaker 2: Yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) with your mother's [Ruth Silas Batts] family for a minute.  So you, you just described the house, what is your earliest memory?
Speaker 2: I--my earliest memory, there're a couple.  I remember when I used to believe in Santa Claus.  I clearly remember the feeling of how it felt to believe in Santa Claus, because the Christmas tree would be put in my room, in--in my bedroom and I'd be so exhausted with anticipation that I fell asleep long enough for them, whoever Santa Claus was, to put the gifts under the tree and then wake up in surprise the next morning.  The other memory I have of--of that apartment and being there was my closet and my shoes.  I loved shoes and I hated to throw out shoes even though I outgrew them, and I would stuff my feet in shoes because I--I loved them so much, rather than get rid of them.  And my grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] used to have to snatch them from me.  She said no your feet are too big for these shoes, you can't wear these shoes anymore.  And I--and I just, you know, felt very, very big about accumulating a wardrobe of shoes.  Because I guess also later when I was going to grammar school, I went to a grammar school that had--was a parochial school [Our Lady of Lourdes School, New York, New York] so you had to wear a certain kind of a uniform and the same thing in high school [St. Walburga's Academy, New York, New York].  But they sent me to school at a very early age, I believe I was eighteen months when I went to this nursery school.  And I was telling this story the other day about how we were--we were at this modern school and they would--they would teach us out of books.  We would be reading, learning to read and they were not licensed to teach.  So when the inspectors would come, they would tell us we're gonna play this game now called hide the books.  So we--when the inspectors came to the nursery school, we hide--hid the books and pretended--started playing with toys that were around, you know.  It was like a game.  So we became actresses (laughter) at a very early age.
Story_ID: 522395
Speaker 1: But you also learned to read at a very early age, correct (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah I learned to read and learned to dance at an early age too, because they had a recital, they had a dance and exercise school or it--it was really a dance school.  But I ne- I remember my first shoes, again with the shoes, was rhythm shoes and these were like suede shoes with el- elastic across the top.  And I wanted ballet shoes because I was a ballet fiend, fan from the very beginning.  I used to cut out pictures in the newspapers and anybody had an old magazine I was really crazy about ballet pictures and I'd paste them in the book.  And so I would--these rhythm shoes we--we used them to, to have our recitals.  And it was a big deal because these were things that people in the neighborhood [Sugar Hill, New York, New York] really had to stretch their budget to afford to buy because it wasn't a necessary thing, it was, you know, a luxury to be able to afford dance shoes and sometimes at the recitals to pay for the dance costumes.  And my first costume that I remember was as a snowflake in 'The Nutcracker,' and this white puffy tutu.  And later on though, I--there some people in the neighborhood that were ballet teachers and my [maternal] grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] found out about them.  There was--there were two people, the Facey twins, Marjorie [Marjorie Facey] and Marion Facey and they taught dance.  And they--their claim to fame was that they were taught by Aubrey Hitchens who was a partner of Pavlova [Anna Pavlova].  So that--with that reputation, you know, everybody was wanting to take from these people, because it was as if they, themselves, were you know, had taken from Pavlova, which of course it's the same type of dance, it's the same style.  But of course nobody ever saw Pavlova in our--our neighborhood.  But there was also another guy who taught dance and his name was Sheldon Hoskins, yeah, Sheldon Hoskins.
Speaker 1: And this was all when you were a little girl?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So dance became important starting from nursery school?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 522396
Speaker 1: Now I wanna go back to the house.  You described already where your [maternal] grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] sat and looked out the window.  As you recall where you lived, what are the--are there any additional sights, smells, sounds that you recall?
Speaker 2: Oh yes.  The strawberry pink Cadillac.  I think it was Sugar Ray Robinson, he used to drive down Convent Avenue [New York, New York] and people used to run to the window.  He would drive very slowly so that everybody had a chance to look at his Cadillac and we thought that we were really something having a celebrity like that in our neighborhood.
Story_ID: 522397
Speaker 1: And it made us--was--we talked about that for ages.  It was just everybody used to--but there were a couple of other things besides his Cad- his celebrity, there was Mantan Moreland, lived in our neighborhood as well.  He didn't have a pink Cadillac, but he--we knew that he lived in the build--in the building--
Speaker 2: And who was he?
Speaker 1: Mantan Moreland was the sidekick of Charlie Chan in all of those movies, those black and white mystery movies.
Speaker 2: And at that time, was--what was your neighborhood called?
Speaker 1: It was called Washington Heights--Sugar Hill [New York, New York].
Speaker 2: And was it an integrated neighborhood then?
Speaker 1: No, it was not integrated.  The integration was, there were lots of people from all different islands, from Haiti, from Jamaica, from other islands, but there were no, no white people.  The only white people that came through there were the ones who were going to City College [City College of New York, New York, New York].  And that brings me to the fact that there was a very notorious lady who lived across the street from us in a whitestone apar- building and her name was Madame French [Stephanie St. Clair].  And she was--she was a numbers runner and I--my [maternal] grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] used to send me over there to play the numbers.  And it was very difficult for me to go over there because her place, she had--she had the whole house, but the bottom floor had a big altar and the altar had many, many statues of saints and it just scared me for some reason.  Because people used to say that she was a great practitioner of voodoo and all kinds of rumors of what she did in that building.  There were candles lit at all times with these statues of the saints.  And--but she--I mean she never did any harm to anybody, I don't think, but later on I found out that she was this numbers runner.  I don't know if she ever went to jail for it, but--or--you know, the extent of her--her infamy.  I know that in a couple of movies there--that Larry Fishburne [Laurence Fishburne] was in one ['Hoodlum'] about Harlem [New York, New York] and she was one of the characters in it and I think Cicely Tyson played her, the part of Madame French.
Speaker 2: And you describe that she lived in a whitestone, and in Harlem typically there are brownstones.  So what did your neighborhood look like in--because that would've stood out a lot if there was a whitestone house?
Speaker 1: Yes, it was a chain of whitestone houses that were on Convent Avenue right across the street from where I lived, and they were attached.  And they had like a platform in the middle of it if--as if there was gonna back front lawn, instead of the front lawn there was this raised platform of concrete.  And each of them were the same.  And there was an entrance to the bottom of the house and then there was a staircase that led to the top for the second floor entrance.
Speaker 2: And was your house a brownstone?
Speaker 1: No, the--my house was a red brick--one of three brick buildings that they were the predecessor of these high rises.  It was an apartment building, but it only had eight floors.
Speaker 2: And you were on the second?
Speaker 1: And I was on the first (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) On the first, ah.
Speaker 1: Yes, we were on the first floor.
Story_ID: 522398
Speaker 1: So, where did you go to school?
Speaker 2: The first school that I remember going to after the--the nursery schools and--and the modern school was the parochial school, Our Lady of Lourdes [Our Lady of Lourdes School, New York, New York].  And that was another church and school.  The church was on 142nd Street and the school was on 143rd Street, so they were back-to-back.
Speaker 1: So were you walking to these schools, everything was close (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes, yeah.  Because the--the school and the church were between Convent Avenue and Amsterdam Avenue.  And I remember there was a, what they call the mortician, I--Ralph--
Speaker 1: A funeral director?
Speaker 2: A funeral parlor right next to the--to the school, Ralph and I can't remember their last names right now.  But he was--he went to the school as well.  He and his sister were also--Daniels, right, Ralph Daniels [ph.].  Ralph Daniels and his father was the person who owned the establishment.  And I guess he went into the business right after his--his father retired.  I'm--I h- I never heard of what happened to them after I graduated from high school, actually from grammar school.  And I have somewhere in the bowels of this apartment there's a picture of all of us on the steps of the church, of Our Lady of Lourdes, our graduation picture.  We wore white cap and gown, and the guys wore military outfits, had military hats and suits.
Speaker 1: This parochial school, was it all black or was it integrated?
Speaker 2: It was integrated.  I remember we had Irish, because the neighborhood was partially Irish, but the Irish people lived more towards the Hudson River.  So the further west you got, you had more--more white people.  And there were people from Cuba, there were people from Santo Domingo [Dominican Republic] and that area, because there were a lot of Spanish people I remember.  And there were some Polish people as well.
Story_ID: 522399
Speaker 1: Now, you grew up with your [maternal] grandparents [Louise Petgrave Silas and Alfred Silas].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: We--we're move towards your father's [Mercer Ellington] family now.  But, why did you grow up with your grandparents?
Speaker 2: Well this is another mystery that I'm trying to solve.  I think it was a--at one point there had to be a discussion as to my birth right on who I was going to. Who I was gonna be with, who was gonna raise me.  So my sisters and I try--we're trying to get to the bottom in my mother's lifetime and she wouldn't talk about it.  But we were trying to understand why I was given to my grandmother to raise and not my mother [Ruth Silas Batts], especially after my mother married this doctor [James A. Batts] and they lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  My grandmother refused to give me up.  I remember being on the phone, calling my father asking him for child support payments because my grandmother, as I said she was a very strong political person and an activist, and she decided that she needed for him to pay child support payments whether it was to her or to my mother, but since she decided to raise me, she wanted him to pay her.  And at the time, we used to have to go downtown [New York, New York] to where all of those--those government buildings are.  There used to be a big building that was a prison, an old, old prison that housed these--these felons and it was a Baroque-looking huge, like a tower.  It--it seemed like something out of a storybook, but my grandmother used to say that one of the prisoners in that bui- in that building wrote a song called 'I Wish I Had Someone To Love Me.'  And she would sing that song and it was the saddest at--song, and I would always cry and so she would take me then to a friend of hers who worked in the board of education building and the friend would give me pencils and erasers and pads, that made up for everything.  And then we would go to Chinatown [New York, New York] and have Chinese food.
Story_ID: 522400
Speaker 1: So, I remember my, my [maternal] grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] in her window dressing and seeing different people, and she--she had several people ask for my--that--for me, besides my mother [Ruth Silas Batts] and her then husband, Dr. Batts [James A. Batts].  But one of Duke Ellington's associates, one of his arrangers, Luther Henderson, was also in the neighborhood [Sugar Hill, New York, New York]. He lived further up on Convent Avenue like at 139th Street and Luther was married then to a lady named Tilly [ph.], and I don't think that she could have children.  And so Luther wanted to adopt me and he asked my grandmother.  And obviously he went straight to my grandmother and not my father [Mercer Ellington], although he may have talked to my father before, I don't know.  But of course my grandmother said no, she was not giving me up, so Luther didn't get to get--to get me.  So I don't know (laughter), I mean there's so many of these things that are--are so--people in those days used to keep information from children, especially.  I don't know why, what they thought we would do, go out in the street and yell and scream about it or what, you know.  But it really made a difference and now I'm trying to put these pieces together.  It would've been so helpful had I known exactly what happened, unless there was some terrible thing.  And then so now I'm making up stuff.  You know, I'm saying oh was it that bad that she wouldn't let me know.  So, I think it would've been better if I had known.
Story_ID: 522401
Speaker 1: Now, we haven't met your father yet, so tell me who is your father?
Speaker 2: So, my father is Mercer Ellington, and Mercer Ellington is the son and the only child of Duke Ellington.  Now my father went to school, a school called Evander Childs [Evander Childs High School; Evander Childs Educational Campus, New York, New York] which is the school that my mother [Ruth Silas Batts] went to, which is the school that Luther Henderson went to.  So they were all buddies and they knew each other.  They probably hang--hung out together and they were all musical.  They were all interested in music, so they had lots of things in common.  And that is how, you know, they--when their common ground was always the music and then became Duke Ellington, because of my father.  My father was really a great mathematician and I think his--he has--had aspired to be an engineer because of his math.  And as it turns out, I really believe that a lot of musicians are very good at math anyway because of the structure of the music.  But he--he decided that, you know, he wanted to be a musician.  I--and he--he went through so many different things.  He was a deejay at one point and he liked doing that, and then he managed a group, a choral group at one point and then he did--he managed Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett] at one point; that was really later on.  But he had a lot of aspirations as to what he wanted to do with his life and I think ultimately my grandfather thought that he was doing him a favor by giving him a directive to be involved with the Duke Ellington Orchestra, also that was also later on that he became a member of the--of the Ellington band.  I think he was playing trumpet earlier, but I'm not--I'm not sure when that he really took that up seriously.  But he was interested in a lot of different things.  So, I think my grandfather felt that he had to give him some direction and he said okay, you have to be involved in music, but when my father--when my father attempted to get his own band together that was a no, no.  Because my grandfather said there should only be one Ellington band.  So, he discouraged him from doing that.
Speaker 1: Did your father grow up with his father?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  My father grew up with his father and I believe they lived in this huge apartment, either Edgecombe Avenue, St. Nicholas Avenue, I think it was Edgecombe Avenue.  One of those huge apartments, like nine-room apartments.  And--because when Billy Strayhorn came up from Pittsburgh [Pennsylvania], Billy Strayhorn stayed in that same apartment with everybody.
Story_ID: 522402
Speaker 1: My [paternal] grandfather really never lived for a long time with my grandmother, my father's mother.
Speaker 2: And who--what was her name?
Speaker 1: Her, her name was Edna [Edna Thompson Ellington].  And Edna was a beautiful woman.
Speaker 2: Edna Thompson?
Speaker 1: Edna Thompson, beautiful woman.  She had this straight black hair, she looked like Native American and I believe that some of her family was Native American.  And--but she--
Speaker 2: Were she and Duke [Duke Ellington] married?
Speaker 1: They were married.  That was the only time, that was his only wife.  I know that he had many mistresses after that, but that was his only wife and he never divorced her.  So that was--this is where we come into a discrepancy of who was really his wife and what was, you know, this.  People have their thoughts about different things because his long-time mistress was Evie--Evie Ellis and she was a dancer at the Cotton Club [New York, New York], they met there, and they had a very long-term relationship.  Course Fredi Washington was another person, another dancer.  He had a tendency to go for dancers, and she was also a Cotton Club dancer and he went with her for a while.  And Bobby Short told me at one point that Fredi Washington was almost my grandmother.  Now, I don't think that could've happened time wise because Fredi Washington came after Edna.  So Ellington wasn't going to divorce Edna and never did divorce her, so.
Speaker 2: How long do you think they stayed together?
Speaker 1: Fredi--
Speaker 2: No not Fredi, Edna?
Speaker 1: Not a long time, because he was away most of the time and she did not travel with him.  So they didn't really establish a home life.  I know she--they were together for the early stages practically of--or probably the early stages of my father's [Mercer Ellington] life when she--when she gave birth to my father.  But I don't even think he hung around that long with her after my father's birth, so my father was raised by Edna--
Speaker 2: Without Duke (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) without--without a father.
Story_ID: 522403
Speaker 1: Did you consider Edna [Edna Thompson Ellington] to be your grandmother?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I--that's--that was the one, you know, legally and every other way she was the one who was married and she was the only one.  As I said, she was the only one who was married to Ellington [Duke Ellington].
Speaker 1: And you had a relationship with her?
Speaker 2: And I did briefly before she passed.  I went to visit her.  She lived--she lived in one of those brownstones in Washington, D.C. and I got to talk to her.  And she wanted to know me more and I never made it down to Washington to visit with her for various and sundry reasons.  And then when I--by the time I'd heard of her death it was just, you know, too late.
Speaker 1: You were about how old when she passed?
Speaker 2: I was a June Taylor Dancer--
Speaker 1: Okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --(Simultaneous) when she passed.  So I was in my twenties.
Speaker 1: So you were a young woman.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 522404
Speaker 1: Now Mildred Dixon, who was she (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Another one.  Okay this--this is another (laughter), I mean I'm always associating these relationships with buildings.  Because Ellington [Duke Ellington] bought two buildings on Riverside Drive between 105th [Street] and 106th [Street, New York, New York], and those are townhouses.  And one he bought for my father [Mercer Ellington] and one he bought for his ladies, and Mildred Dixon was like the landlady of that--of one of those buildings.  And people lived there like there was Louise Michelle, I think, lived there for a while and there were other people, other ladies who lived there in that building.
Speaker 1: So, ladies plural, lived in the building at the same time?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Knowing that they were his ladies?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell me more?
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: How did that work--how did that work?
Speaker 2: I--I don't know really how it worked because I had a fleeting relationship with each of the ladies.  I mean I would have maybe dinner with them at some points.  It's not like I would hang with them.  And at another--another point, his sister, Ruth--Ruth Ellington [Ruth Ellington Boatwright], she moved into the building and she had the entire building.  I think this was after my father moved out.  My--of the two buildings, one was supposed to have been Ellington's building, was my father's building, became Ruth's building.  The other building was--were--was occupied by the ladies in his life.  And they all knew each other and there was no, you know.  I don't--I don't know how this was managed that if and when he visited them, did he visit one at a time, did he, you know, go to take them out?
Story_ID: 522405
Speaker 1: I know that when the, the Ellington band [Duke Ellington Orchestra] was in town, and they toured a lot, they toured the world, except for Cuba, they toured the world and they never, when--when they toured it was there was never a stone unturned.  I mean I--I'm astounded, I went to teach at a place in Canada called Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, Saskatoon [Canada], and this is in the middle of Saskatchewan which is in the middle of Canada, nowhere, like unbelievable.  It's infamous because you can see the Northern Lights which is one of their outstanding things.  And Ellington--I--when I went there to teach I saw that the Ellington band had been there, and this is like so weird.  Everywhere that I've been subsequently in my life, he was there before, whether it's famous places or not so famous places.
Story_ID: 522406
Speaker 1: But back to the building, (laughter) this was a group of buildings [in New York, New York] that a lot of his, his life was spent I guess in real estate and my--my--my great aunt, she managed and her job was actually--
Speaker 2: Ruth [Ruth Ellington Boatwright]?
Speaker 1: Ruth.  Ruth--her job was to see that nothing, co- no collisions took place between and it--it extended to the hospital when he [Ellington's paternal grandfather, Duke Ellington] was dying.  She would manage so that no--none of the two ladies--none--no two ladies would be there at the same time.  She would schedule the visits so that they didn't meet up with one another.
Speaker 2: So she had to know who everybody was?
Speaker 1: She knew everybody.  She knew where they were.  She managed the checkbooks.  She managed to, you know, juggle the occasions and the events, and see well who is gonna go to see him at the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York] or who was gonna go see him at the Rainbow Room [New York, New York] or who was gonna go see him, so it would be different people, different times.  Who's gonna celebrate his birthday.  I know I have a birthday--I have a picture of Evie Ellis and him at a birthday, and I think it was his birthday, a big birthday cake.
Story_ID: 522407
Speaker 1: You said except for Cuba, why did they not go to Cuba?
Speaker 2: I have no idea and I'm trying to solve the problem because I would like to bring the Duke Ellington Center Big Band to Cuba now that we can go.  I mean when things get straightened out a little bit, because I'd like to complete his tour of Ellington [Duke Ellington] music going there.  I know Wynton Marsalis has been there, but I'd like to bring Ellington there.
Story_ID: 522408
Speaker 1: You said that your father [Mercer Ellington] and mother [Ruth Silas Batts] went to the same high school, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--Evander Childs [Evander Childs High School; Evander Childs Educational Campus, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And that's how they came to know each other.  When were they in relationship?
Speaker 2: They probably were in the relationship at the high school, from the high school.
Speaker 1: Do you have any idea how long that relationship lasted?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure because according to various people that I talk to, my father wanted to marry my mother and my [paternal] grandfather [Duke Ellington] said no or Ruth [Ruth Ellington Boatwright] told me that--said that he was too young to get married or to get hung up, I guess he was trying to fashion it after his own life.  So he didn't approve of him getting married, he was against the marriage, and my--but my great aunt tells another story.  My great aunt says it's because my mother, or my grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] wanted my father to convert to Catholicism.  I kind of not, you know, think that that's true because the times it was such a bad thing for people to be born out of wedlock and because I was born out of wedlock it just so happened that the year that I was born was the first year that they did not put on the birth certificate illegitimate.  They used to write illegitimate on the birth certificates of people who were born out of wedlock.
Speaker 1: And so you were born in '39 [1939], correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And that year was the first year they decided not to do it, in the Catholic church or just in general?
Speaker 2: No, government, birth certificates.
Speaker 1: So your--when it was discovered that your mother was pregnant, do you know anything about what happened during that period?
Speaker 2: That's the fuzzy part we've been trying to figure out because I mean how she could hide the pregnancy, I know I was born in Sydenham Hospital here in New York [New York].  But it was shortly after that that my grandmother must've shuttled her off to nursing school or in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] because eventually that's where she went and that's where she came to live.  And she met her husband, James Batts [James A. Batts], the doctor at the nursing school where she was attending and they got married and that's where they ended up living.
Speaker 1: And you don't know how or why the decision was made for her mother to take you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'cause she wanted to take me and my--my stepfather wanted to take me, but my grandmother said no.
Story_ID: 522409
Speaker 1: What was your relationship with your mother?
Speaker 2: It was like a sister.  I--
Speaker 1: Now how old was she when you were born?
Speaker 2: She was maybe nineteen.  And I felt like I had a relationship with her like she was my sister, I called her Ruth [Ruth Silas Batts].  I didn't--this was a thing of name calling that I--I was so mixed up as to what to call who, and so I called her Ruth.  And it wasn't 'til years later when she had had an aneurysm and was--had almost died that I asked her, I said, "Can I call you mom?"  And she said, "Sure, yeah, of course."  But all that time I'd called her Ruth and lots of people thought that we were sisters.
Speaker 1: What did you call your [maternal] grandparents [Louise Petgrave Silas and Alfred Silas]?
Speaker 2: I called my grandmother, her mother, Mommsy and I called my grandfather, Poppsy.  I called my father [Mercer Ellington], I didn't know what to call my father, I ended up calling him dad.  And I was asking him at one point, what I should call my grandfather, and he said he'd ask him and my grandfather told me that I should call him Uncle Edward [Duke Ellington] and to make things, you know, a little light he said, "And I'll call you Aunt Mercedes [HistoryMaker Mercedes Ellington]."  But it was, you know, these titles of what--what people were and who they were and how they got to be where they ended up, it was like a jigsaw puzzle almost.  You know, putting the pieces together and trying to figure out, now I'm still here trying to figure out-put, put together some of the pieces that were left untold by my mother, untold by my father.
Story_ID: 522410
Speaker 1: But your parents were in your life even though you lived with your [maternal] grandparents [Louise Petgrave Silas and Alfred Silas], is that right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  My--my--my mother [Ruth Silas Batts], I used to go to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] and visit them in the summertime and when they had kids we became very great friends and we still are, great friends. And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) How many children did they have?
Speaker 2: They had three.  They had twins [Diane Batts Morrow and HistoryMaker Deborah A. Batts] and a--and a younger girl [Denise Batts].  And of the twins, one of them is a federal judge and the other one is a professor of ethnic history at the university in--of Georgia [University of Georgia] in Athens [Georgia].  And the youngest one, she's a computer nerd.
Speaker 1: And you all are close?
Speaker 2: And what?
Speaker 1: You all are close?
Speaker 2: We are very close, yeah.  We just went down to see the birth of another member of the family, my--my this is so entangled.  My sister's son's wife, my--the son and the wife had a baby recently and we went to Philadelphia, all of us had a family reunion and we went down for the viewing of the bo- of the baby.
Speaker 1: Is your mother still living?
Speaker 2: No, my mom died a few years back.  She was deteriorating very, very badly.  First she--she fell in the closet reaching for something and broke a small bone in her hip and then she was on a walker.  And from the walker, which was really bad for her because she always like to dance and even with the walker, I would go, she was in a--not a nursing home, what are those other places called.
Speaker 1: Assisted living?
Speaker 2: Assisted living, she was in an assisted-living place right here in New York [New York] on 10th Avenue and 46th Street and I would go and we would do the Shim Sham Shimmy, and she would hold onto the walker, 'cause she knew all of this stuff, this was all part of her upbringing when they used to dance at the--those ballroom dances.
Speaker 1: Do you feel you got your love of dance from her?
Speaker 2: I think so, I think I did.
Story_ID: 522411
Speaker 1: Mercer [Mercer Ellington].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Your father, was he living in New York City [New York, New York] when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Actually he was living in St. Albans [Queens, New York].  My grandfather [Duke Ellington] probably bought him a house in St. Albans, that was across the street from Count Basie's house.  And that was the place for lots of musicians of color to buy in Queens [New York] and St. Albans, I mean that's where Louis Armstrong was and lots of other musicians bought property in--in those kinds of places.  Except for Cab Calloway--Cab Calloway he wa- he went to Yonkers [New York].  He and his family, they were.
Speaker 1: Why did he make that choice, do you know?
Speaker 2: No, I, you know, he was very peculiar guy who wanted to distinguish himself and anything that he could do to be different, that was--that was what he did.  And I was very good friends with his daughter Chris [Chris Calloway].  We were supposed to do--we did a thing at the, I guess it was some kind of symposium at the 92nd Street Y [New York, New York] and we were on our way to constructing a regular radio show that we were gonna do together.  But she moved out to Arizona and she got very sick, and she passed away.
Speaker 1: So your father lived in St. Albans, a community of artists.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Did he marry?
Speaker 2: He married my stepmother, Evelyn Harrison [Evelyn Harrison Ellington] and she was from--her family is from Atlantic City [New Jersey].  I'm not sure how they met, but Evelyn was a very, you know, conservative type of person and not connected to music at all in any way.  As a matter of fact, she didn't really like music that much (laughter), I still say--she's still living, but he used to practice--liked to practice his trumpet in the basement and she would just try to go as far away as she could possibly go to keep from hearing it.  And of course, also the basement was the site of my father's Li- extensive Lionel train set in which he was in competition with Count Basie and his extensive Lionel train set.  That was the thing in those days, train sets.  People just, you know, loved to--hobbies were centered around those kinds of things and building up your train set and establishing all kinds of terrain and tunnels and mountains and bridges, and was--I--I think there's still a Lionel train store somewhere, but you can probably do it mainly online now.  They've--
Speaker 1: Well now it's turned into the virtual (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Virtual train sets, exactly, you know.  Like what they're gonna do.  All these old things, like Macy's [Macy's, Inc.] I understand now they're closing so many of the stores that you're gonna have to be really--it'll be a virtual Macy's and Macy's is such a, you know, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade and all of those things.
Speaker 1: That main one is not gonna go.
Story_ID: 522412
Speaker 1: What was your father [Mercer Ellington] like?
Speaker 2: My, my father was like two people.  My father was the stern father who reprimanded me if I stayed out late.  For instance, there was a ballroom in New York [New York] called the Palladium [Palladium Ballroom] and this was after my [maternal] grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] died and I didn't wanna go to live with my mother [Ruth Silas Batts] in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], because I was accepted into Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  So in order for me to go to Juilliard I would have to live someplace in--in New York and so I lived with my father in St. Albans [Queens, New York].
Speaker 1: So this is after you've graduated from high school?
Speaker 2: From high school.  And this is where I'm trying to put all those--those pieces together.  I graduated from high school--
Speaker 1: Wh- where did you go to high school?
Speaker 2: St. Walburga's Academy [New York, New York] on Riverside Drive and 139th Street.
Speaker 1: And this was--was this also a parochial school?
Speaker 2: Yes, parochial school, uniform.  We marched in the St. Patrick's Day parade.  And after I graduated from there, I--I mean I was accepted into Juilliard.  So the series of events.  I--I have a picture somewhere, a fuzzy picture of my grandmother attending my graduation from high school.  Shortly after that is when she died.  Then I--I go into Juilliard in the next season, so it must've been like the spring, so the fall was into Juilliard.  But it was a lot of--and the Juilliard that I went to was on Broadway and 122nd Street, which is where Manhattan School of Music [New York, New York] is now.  That's the building that was the old Juilliard.  There were two courses, there was a five-year course where you could get a Bachelor of Science degree and then there was a shorter course where you just got a diploma.  But my--and I didn't wanna go to college, I just wanted to go out and try to get shows on Broadway, and audition for things.  But my father was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Because, let me just back up a little bit, because you--we--you started with dance as a little thing in nursery school, when did you figure out that this is what you wanted to do?
Speaker 2: I figured out really early when I was taking dance classes from the Facey twins [Marjorie Facey and Marion Facey] on Convent Avenue.
Speaker 1: They were African American?
Speaker 2: And they were African American.  But there was just no track record of anybody around.  The only person that was remotely associated with ballet was [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade's sister [sic. cousin, Janet Collins], who was a ballerina with Monte Carlo ballet [Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo].
Speaker 1: And what was her name?
Speaker 2: God, I can't remember, it just went out of my head.  I was talking about her the other day.  And Carmen was talking about her too the other day.  It'll come back.  But this was--these were times when black people were not accepted into the ballet world and so I made a segue, I said okay if I'm not gonna be finding jobs in a ballet company, because this was before [HistoryMaker] Arthur Mitchell's company [Dance Theatre of Harlem] and before any of the--
Speaker 1: Around what year are we talking?
Speaker 2: Let's see, '60s [1960s]--gotta be--
Speaker 1: Or even earlier?
Speaker 2: Earlier, yeah, '50s [1950s], late, middle late '50s [1950s], because I remember I had a scholarship to the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School [New York, New York] and it was those teachers were the same teachers that taught at Juilliard.  And so it was through--
Speaker 1: And this was in high school?
Speaker 2: This was--yeah.
Speaker 1: So when would--so you did the Metropolitan--
Speaker 2: The--I--I would go there while I was in high school.
Story_ID: 522413
Speaker 1: And let me ask you, because you are also now growing up at a time when there's a lot of social unrest happening.  Brown versus Board of Education [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] happened while you were still in high school [St. Walburga's Academy, New York, New York], I believe?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Because you went to parochial school I'm just wondering wer- so you weren't necessarily directly affected by that (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Nope.
Speaker 1: --but the atmosphere was electric regarding race relations.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah
Speaker 1: What do you remember?
Speaker 2: No.  Well, I--I can only refer to it as you say from what I knew and what I was involved in it, and that was with the dance.  For instance, there was a Polish woman who came to--she came to my grammar school [Our Lady of Lourdes School, New York, New York] to teach ballet every Tuesday.  And we would change our shoes and still wear our uniforms and take this class.  And I knew that she had a school downtown and I wanted to be enrolled in this school downtown so I could take Saturday lessons, this is grammar school.  And I kept on asking my [maternal] grandmother [Louise Petgrave Silas] to talk to the woman to see if I could.  And every time my grandmother talked to her she said that her enrollment was filled.  And every year, no matter how early it was, the enrollment was al- al- always filled.  So my grandmother took me by the hand at one point and took me--marched me into the Reverend Mother's office.  I told you she was a political person.  And she said this is not acceptable anymore.  I'm not accepting this--this type of excuse for her not to go to the school downtown.  You have to--this is a Catholic Church, you're supposed to be teaching grace, you're supposed to be teaching about do unto others and--and all of this, and now you are keeping--you're--you're active in keeping my daughter--my granddaughter from going into this school that she qualifies for and still is, for some reason, unable to get into.  So as a--a I guess, it was supposed to be a comfort to my grandmother, the Reverend Mother talked to the teacher and the teacher gave me a solo.  So on St. Patrick's Day evening performances, which we gave, I had a solo.  And that was my, you know, comfort for not being accepted.  So the only way--I mean it was--it was just a catch 22, I mean ho- how was this supposed to make up for the fact that I couldn't go to the school downtown.  But this is what was offered.
Speaker 1: You didn't get to go to the school downtown (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Never went to the school downtown, no.
Story_ID: 522414
Speaker 1: Another thing that happened as you were growing up, Marian Anderson became the first African American to perform at the Metropolitan Opera [Metropolitan Opera House] in New York [New York].  Do you remember that?
Speaker 2: Yes, I remember that.  I remember everybody talking about it, because the neighborhood, even if things did not occur in the neighborhood or to people we knew in the neighborhood, anything that happened of note to people of color was always kind of a boost in the neighborhood and in their thinking of how they fit into this whole atmosphere, this whole world and how they were thought of.  So that if somebody, even one person made it, they were automatically elevated to another level.
Speaker 1: Well, and you mentioned earlier that one person, you remember, [HistoryMaker] Carmen De Lavallade's sister [sic. cousin]--
Speaker 2: Janet Collins.  Janet Collins.
Speaker 1: --was--was dancing, correct?  But it was rare, so with--with Marian Anderson getting such a prestigious role, did--did this have any effect on your belief that you could actually fulfill your dream of becoming a dancer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean it--it was Mahalia [Mahalia Jackson], it was Marian Anderson, it was Shirley Verrett, it was all of these people, I mean and successive generations, the buildup of--of how and--how everyone was allowed to perform and to--to practice their craft.  And these people who spent years and years studying and--and to what end.  I mean some people would--just became perpetual students because they never had a chance to perform.  They never had the opportunity, they were never allowed to.  A lot of people will say well they weren't good enough, they didn't have the chops for it, and maybe that was it.  But I think more often than not, the problem was that they were not given the opportunity.  That--that it was not presented to them.  I mean there's another story that is really ridiculous, but I remember auditioning for a show called 'No Strings,' [Samuel A. Taylor] later on.  And [HistoryMaker] Diahann Carroll and Richard Kiley were the stars of the show.  And we--a group of us, Hispanic and pe- and dancers of color, we got together, we used to hang together and go because there weren't a lot of shows on Broadway that we could audition for because they weren't hiring people of color, even in the chorus.  So we used to get together because we see each other at dance class, I mean that's the thing, when you weren't performing, the only thing that you could do was to take classes.  Now where you--where did you get the money for these classes, you do odd jobs around, enough money to go to unemployment so that you could have the money to pay for these classes.  And so we would--we got together and we said well we don't know maybe this is an opportunity where they would hire people of color since Diahann Carroll is in it.  So we got together and we went--and went through the audition and we passed everything in the audition, we got to be in the final group that was kept.  And then the choreographer took us aside and said, "I don't know if I'm going to be allowed to hire any of you because we have to check with Diahann Carroll whether she wants, you know, any other people of color in the show or whether she just wants to be a standout, you know."  So we went for coffee and when we came back they said well no we decided that, you know, you--you won't be able to be in the show.  And it--it didn't make sense to us, you know, and it still doesn't make sense to us now--to me now, it might not have been Diahann Carroll's decision, they may have just talked to the producers, I'm sure the producers are the ones who have the big say over it, so--it's their money, you know.  You know, very rarely (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) What a thing to say.
Speaker 2: You know, ho- how--do the stars get that--unless they've reached, you know, a certain acclaim.  But that was the kind of stuff that went on and--and that you had to settle and that you had to lower your expectations of how much you could achieve, because this ceiling was there and it was keeping you and there was no absolute reason.  And the time span for dancers, who are athletes, to use that facility and for it to be still, your body still answering the questions (laughter) that you're giving it, is very small.
Story_ID: 522415
Speaker 1: Well, to that end, you've written about your extreme desire to get out there right away--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and not go to college because you wanted--you didn't want the window to close on how long your body would--(laughter) would be your friend.  And your family didn't like that idea?
Speaker 2: No they--they thought I should get an education.  They wanted me to be able--that would--the term, I think there was a phrase to fall back on, that was the phrase.  Something for me to fall back on.
Speaker 1: And this coming from your [paternal] grandfather who at this point is an international superstar.  And your father [Mercer Ellington] was working with him by--by then, correct?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they would be called very successful?
Speaker 2: Very successful.  The only other information or the--only other advice that they gave me on a positive side of performing was that I should go to Europe.  Because that's what happened with Josephine Baker.  She was not able to establish a profession--a professional career here in the states, so she went to Europe and she became a star.  And I didn't necessarily wanna be a star, I just wanted to be allowed to work in any kind of given atmosphere in a company, in a show or whatever.  But my grandfather said, no you--you need to go to Europe and establish yourself as a--as a entertainer there, because you'll be allowed to work anywhere, anywhere you want.
Speaker 1: But you didn't do that?
Speaker 2: Didn't--didn't do it.
Speaker 1: Did you ever use the Ellington name to open a door, were you able to do that, did you try to do that?
Speaker 2: Well a lot of people thought that I did.  And I--I have been really hurt and pulled back by that name more than I have been helped by the name.  I remember one show that I overheard people talking, a choreographer talking about, "Well does she think she's gonna get in just because of her name?"  And it's--it wasn't--I mean I wasn't even going--like I said I wasn't even going for a starring role in anything.  I was always very willing and ready to be a chorus dancer.  And it--and those were the times when it was really, really tough and it didn't make any difference.  And I think that--that was probably why Ellington [Duke Ellington], my grandfather, encouraged me to go to Europe because he felt that yes, the name would help me there and I would be able to do what I wanted to do.
Story_ID: 522416
Speaker 1: Ultimately you did take his [Ellington's paternal grandfather, Duke Ellington] advice regarding college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell about ho- how--what was that--your college experience?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my college experience was great because it was a musical college, it was a dance college--
Speaker 1: Where he had gone, correct?
Speaker 2: Where he had--no, he--he had sent Billy Strayhorn there, he had sent Luther [Luther Henderson] there because he wanted them to be trained professionally in arranging--in musical arrange- arrangements.  And he felt that my background I would learn more and I would be able to teach.  See that was the fall back item, that if you couldn't make it as a performer, well then you could probably teach.  And so when I went there I met a lot of people who have since become famous.  I met Pina Bausch.  I met people who are now in the Ail- who were in the original Ailey company, Alvin Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater].  I met Dudley Williams and so many people that were associated with various popular dance companies here.  And also musicians, we were kind of segregated from the musicians because we had a hell of a schedule.  The schedule for dancers was without mercy and this is when I was coming from St. Albans [Queens, New York] on--I'd--I take a bus to the train and from the train another bus to get to Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  And by the time I got there it was like--for a nine o'clock class, forget about it, you know, and most of the time rush hour standing up in all of that traffic.
Speaker 1: So what is it a two-hour commute?
Speaker 2: It was not quite two hours, almost two hours, depending on the--the buses, how they ran.  But it was, it was--I don't know, I can't.  The feeling of--of finally getting--getting into surroundings of some people who would support you.  When I first went, the curriculum of Juilliard was that you had to--you could take--they suggested I take ballet.  I could not be a full ballet major, they wanted me to take modern dance as well.
Story_ID: 522417
Speaker 1: I didn't know anything about any modern dance at that time, and they suggested I take Jose Limon technique.  Now there were two modern dance techniques available, Jose Limon and Martha Graham.  And once I--I--I didn't know--they said that Limon's technique was more balletic and they suggested it was lyrical and I'd probably be more suited to that.  But once I laid my eyes on that Martha Graham technique, that was what I wanted to do because of the contractions and the Greek myths that she used--all the stories that she used to surround, use as--as fodder for her plots in her dances and the costumes.  And the stories that went with it, you know, it was almost like a yoga, it was a combination of yoga and any of those things that use meditation as a high point and as a structure for the--for the technique.  Because a lot of her contractions, for instance, there--there's--there was a series call the Fall series where you just contracted and you--from a standing position and you lay down on the floor, but she only did it to one side because she felt--to the left side, because she felt that the heart should never be exposed.  And she'd do things like this.  I mean there--these--it was almost like a cult, you know, that you wore your hair the same way, you told all these stories she told, all of these--these myths.  And--and then made up her own reasons for the movements that she gave that were all very--I mean they made sense physically as well, but she--she was--she was amazing, she's just amazing.
Speaker 2: And so you chose, her (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I chose her for the last two years [at the Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  I took two years of Limon, two years of Graham.

Speaker 1: While you're at Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York], you're living in St. Albans [Queens, New York], you're living with your father [Mercer Ellington] and his family.  What is that experience like?
Speaker 2: Well, the two--I lived with my father for two years.  And the last two years I couldn't take it anymore, and I said there's a place around the corner and next to Juilliard called International House [New York, New York].  And they accepted students who were out of a coun- from out of the country, out of town, and so because I had lived in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] I said that I had--I was from Philadelphia and that gave me the background that I could get into--to International House.  So I lived in International House for the last two years of Juilliard and I was next door to Pina Bausch.  And because she was from Germany and she was living there and we were good friends, and we worked in the cafeteria together.  So our tuition to International House was reduced by the fact that we were cafeteria workers.  We worked in back of the counter and in--and busing tables as well.  And we traded jobs so that if I was working in back of the counter I had access to food and she would get coffee on her tray, I'd fill up a plate and at the end, after she paid for her coffee I'd give her the plate of food and she would do the same thing for me.  And it was just, you know, the ways and means of pinching pennies, you know, here and there was just--I look back, I can't even look a Hershey bar in the face now because there was a time when I made a meal of rice and a Hershey bar.  It's just stupid stuff, you know.
Story_ID: 522419
Speaker 1: Tell me about the two years before you left your father's [Mercer Ellington] house?
Speaker 2: The two years before I left my father--
Speaker 1: And your relationship with him?
Speaker 2: Well my relationship, he-- (laughter) he was trying--was trying to be a father to me, a person that, you know, from his youth that he had had this affair with and he's trying to balance his feelings between me and the children he had with his wife [Evelyn Harrison Ellington], and treat everybody with equal--you know.  For instance when I did move out to St. Albans and to their house, I--I was--they made space for me up in the attic.  And so my--my room was--was in the attic.  I mean I had access to the bathroom and the rest of the house as well.  But that's where I lived.  And I didn't really get alon- his children didn't know what to make of me, you know, they--I--I guess they felt like I was an imposter into the family grouping that they had, and they didn't see my father that often anyway and then for me to like, you know, intrude on them.
Speaker 1: How much older were you than them?
Speaker 2: I think eight years, there was a eight year difference.  And it was--it was just--to this day it's kind of tenuous relationship, you know.  But I remember when I--I had certain chores that I had to do and I was washing dishes at one point, they didn't have a back- backyard but there was this huge tree and I remember the squirrels used to be very busy, they had built all of their--I think they had like a city in that tr- in that tree and they would get their acorns, you know, and go up and my stepmother used to take the garbage out and whenever she took the garbage out, they would throw the acorns at her and I would be hysterical laughing, you know, I--I--it was just like I couldn't believe that they were on my side.  It was me and the squirrels against the world.
Speaker 1: You wrote about your time in that house as feeling kind of like Cinderella?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, I--I just felt so detached from any kind of family feeling, other than when--I--I know at one point my father bought me a conga drum because I was crazy about Latin music, and that was the other thing of when he became a father was because I stayed out past curfew because I was at the Palladium [Palladium Ballroom, New York, New York] in the city and the person who was driving me home was a little late in getting me home.  And what--by the time I got home it was too late and he slapped me, you know, he says this is not acceptable.  So, and I sa- and you know, it occurred to me, after all of this time, this is what you're gonna do of knowing of my existence and your position and your part in my life and now you're gonna slap me, you know.  So he slapped me and then as punishment, I was not allowed to take dance classes.  So the teacher at the Metropolitan [Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, New York, New York] where I had my scholarship, the teacher called him up and said punish her some other way, but do not punish her by keeping her away from these classes, that's not punishment.  'Cause he knew that that was the only thing that I--that meant anything to me.
Speaker 1: How late were you?
Speaker 2: I was an hour late and I was an hour late because I was in the car with a guy talking about the Palladium and the dances in front of--of the house.  I was in front of the house, I mean I was actually there but I just wasn't inside.
Story_ID: 522420
Speaker 1: Did you ever get closer to your father [Mercer Ellington]?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I got closer to him after I graduated from Juilliard [Juilliard School of Music; The Juilliard School, New York, New York].  My first professional job was in 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] in Australia for six months.
Speaker 1: What year was this?
Speaker 2: Had to be '60s [1960s], no something, I'm trying to put together myself.  I--I believe it was in the '60s [1960s], because it was about the time that the movie 'West Side Story' was out 'cause I had auditioned for the movie of 'West Side Story' and I didn't get it.  But they just called me up and wanted to put me in the company for Australia.  And of course it was like six months' worth of work and I said yes.  And I packed one suitcase to go to Australia for six months.  It was a--I mean it was crazy, and now that I--I think of it now and I wouldn't--I would have had to have several trunks to go someplace like that now.  But--but we went to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was right after you graduated?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So how did they find you?  What were you doing to--
Speaker 2: Well I auditioned for that mov- for the movie 'West Side Story' and when I'm--and they had me on some kind of a list because subsequent to the Broadway show, they were going to be doing regional shows and one of them was gonna be in--in Australia.  So when they put together the Australian company they asked me to go and I said yeah.  So coming--I--I was there for six months.  After the showed over, towards the end, my father called me up.  I don't know how he got my phone number, what happened, don't know--don't remember any of the details.  At that time he was managing Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett].  He was in--he was also--[HistoryMaker] Nancy Wilson.
Story_ID: 522421
Speaker 1: After you came back from your first six months in your professional role you were talking about your father [Mercer Ellington], your--tell me what happened after that?
Speaker 2: Well, I first have to say that after 'West Side Story' [Arthur Laurents] was over in Australia, I was offered another show in Australia, I think either, it was not 'Fiorello!' [Jerome Weidman and George Abbott] but it was another Broadway show that they were bringing into Australia and I turned it down.  And my grandfather [Duke Ellington] ultimately was very angry at me about that because I said I wanted to go home after all of this--this time away to reestablish myself so that I could also become one of the people on Broadway eligible for Broadway things, and he said that home is where the work is.  That was his whole thing.  So I sh- to his mind I should've stayed and done the other show.  But what I did after the show was over, my g- my father called me up and said, "Stop by in Hawaii because I'm here and we can spend some time together."  And I stopped by and he had been managing Della Reese [HistoryMaker Della Reese-Lett] and I believe that he was also having a relationship and he talked to me very plainly about it.  And he said, "I don't wanna embarrass you," and I said, "No I'm not embarrassed, I'm really very happy that you're talking to me like a person and that we can be this close that you would say, you know, consider my feelings in what you're doing, 'cause I mean really it's none of my business."  And Della Reese was at the--at the time, she was under the opinion I think that she was gonna be the next Mercer--Mrs. Mercer Ellington because she would take me shopping and she would get me all kinds of muumuus, I still have these muumuus, and she was being really very, very nice to me.  And--I mean but she was a nice person anyway, you know, but.  She was under the impression that my father was gonna marry her.  And my--but I think my grandfather heard about that and nipped it in the bud and asked--and plucked my father out of that situation, told him to come back home and to--he needed him to take care of his books.  So that was the end of his solo career as wh- as a whatever he wanted to do and now he always became associated with whatever my grandfather wanted him to do with his business and attached to the Ellington, you know, legacy.
Speaker 1: So even though your grandfather was on the road most of the year--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --he was very influential in family affairs?
Speaker 2: Very, well because he held the purse strings, that's where the money, you know, that's where the money was coming from and he had all these, I mean, I don't know how he did it, really.  But managing all of the various aspects of his life, of his family life, of his social life, and putting out all of this, I mean lots of people may have thin- may have thought that Ellington amassed a fortune, but it went out as much as it came in.  As soon as it came in, it went right back out.  And my Great Aunt Ruth [Ruth Ellington Boatwright], she was the one who was in charge of the books and of keeping every b- everything and everybody straight as far as his obligations, financial obligations, which most of them were informal and of his own making, but I mean I think that he supplied my father's wife [Evelyn Harrison  Ellington] with enough money, you know, to--my father with enough money to exist, to have the house in St. Albans [Queens, New York] and to send his children to school and things like that, you know.
Story_ID: 522422
Speaker 1: Did your father [Mercer Ellington] and moth- and--and his wife [Evelyn Harrison Ellington] stay together?
Speaker 2: No.  My father and his wife, they were living actually on West End Avenue and they separated and then I--I don't--did he--he must've divorced her, yes he had to divorce her because he then--his next marriage was to this Swedish flight attendant, Lene, L-E-N-E, Ellington [Lene Scheid Ellington].  Her name, I can't remember her maiden name, but her--they had a son named Paul [Paul Ellington], and Paul is the youngest of the four Ellington grandchildren--Duke Ellington grandchildren.
Speaker 1: And around when did--did he marry her?
Speaker 2: They were going together for years before they actually officially got married.  'Cause Paul is like thirty-two years old now, so I know that they married shortly after Paul was born.  And--and my father didn't wanna have any other children.  Now this is something that I know and that only I was present at and so if anybody wants to say anything about it they can, but I was privy to a conversation between my father and Lene Ellington, and my--and Lene ultimately came down with MS [multiple sclerosis].  And she--that's what she died of.  She was in a wheelchair most of the time that--I mean when I first met her I don't think she was in a me- a wheelchair, but most of the time that I knew her she was in a wheelchair.  She was having a conversation with my father one day at the house.  They were living on the corner of Broadway and 62nd Street [New York, New York], and she was bemoaning the fact that she was in the wheelchair and that she wished that she could be more of--as she said more of a wife to him and be like normal people up and around and about.  And my father said, "Well it's your fault," and I was like taken aback, and I said, well how could he say this.  As it turns out, my father said that it was her decision to have the baby and that she had been told by doctors before that if she went through a pregnancy it would speed up the MS affects and so she would be debilitated by MS if she became pregnant.  Something, the relationship between having a child and the onset and the development of more serious indications of MS were related, and so he--he said that to her and I did--I mean, I didn't know what to say, just.  And Paul was born years after Duke Ellington died so he really had no first-hand knowledge of--of Ellington, but--or experience.  But he now is the estate--he is legally the estate and he has the Duke Ellington Orchestra.  He doesn't like music, he doesn't really wanna be the leader of the Duke Ellington Orchestra and so many times, because the Duke Ellington Orchestra is a saleable factor, there are people who manage it and they're booked in different places because of the name, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, when in fact there's nobody in there connected to the family most of the time.  Sometimes Paul will travel with them sometimes to Japan.  I understand that they did a recent residency in Japan, but most of the time Paul is not anywhere near them.
Story_ID: 522423
Speaker 1: So Paul [Paul Ellington] is the youngest grandchild [of Duke Ellington]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Is the one charge of?
Speaker 2: Of the Ellington estate.
Speaker 1: The Ellington estate.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Why?
Speaker 2: I--I'm still trying to get to the bottom of it.  Because there's kind of a discrepancy as to the validity of the will--of the last will.  There were two wills that were written and one of them was written when my father [Mercer Ellington] was in the hospital, and it is a known fact that you're not supposed to be signing any legal papers when you're in the hospital and you're, you know, you're ill, you're not of sound body.  But it was always a mystery--the--the whole situation of my father's death was a mystery.  I was supposed to go over to--he was in Denmark, and he was supposed to be doing some--some business in Denmark because he had had--he bought a house there for his wife, Lene [Lene Scheid Ellington], because that's where her family lived.  And he was gonna go there and closeout the house, sell the house and then come back.
Speaker 1: Because she had already passed?
Speaker 2: Be- because--well no, she was still alive.  He--she--he died before she did.  And he was coming back and--but he got sick over there.  See this--after he was sick here, he went back to Denmark and he got sick there and came down with a series of things including pneumonia that took him out.  So he died over there.  And then she wanted to--
Speaker 1: When was this, when did he die?
Speaker 2: Oh God, I--I can't remember the year.  It had to be, well, it had to be in the late '80s [sic. 1996] because we did 'Sophisticated Ladies' on Broadway from the early '80s [1980s].  Could've been early '90s [1990s], I'm not sure, I'd have--I've gotta go figure this stuff out, it's ridiculous.  But as, but Lene, as proof to the rest of us, Gaye [Gaye Ellington] and Edward [Edward Ellington II], and myself that he was really dead, she took a picture of herself in the wheelchair in front of his closed coffin and she sent the picture back and said--because I was on my way over there to see him in the hospital.  Because Paul had called me up and Paul was there and he said this looks like it's coming close to the end.  And my friend, Phoebe Jacobs, she was gonna get me a ticket to go over there and be with my father until the end just so he would know that he'd have a familiar face around him 'cause who--I didn't--nobody knew who was there, except for his Denmark family--Lene and her family.  And but before I could get out, he was gone.  I got a phone call from Paul saying that he--he'd died.
Speaker 1: And you said that there was a second will that--was that one written prior?
Speaker 2: Well, it was--the will was--see there's a royalty pool that's involved in this whole situation.  There are about six music publishing companies involved in handling Duke Ellington's catalogue, because he wrote approximately three thousand compositions.  So of the six comp- six music publishing companies--the whole situation, instead of being divided in fourths, it was originally divided in fifths, and the fifth I felt he did because he wanted to leave money for Lene, so it would be his children, Edward, Gaye, myself and Paul, and his wife, so that's why it would be in fifths.  After Lene passed, we were saying well why is it, why would Paul be getting two-fifths and the rest of us still the one-fifth, and we were asking questions and it's still unresolved because there was a--there was a second will that stated that it would be in equal fourths.  And the terms of--about when that decision would--I mean when that would happen, when that would take effect.  So, it's a really complicated thing and I--and nobody wants to touch it for some reason, because it's almost like everybody wants to keep the peace and not get--stir up the pot again to be angry.  As it is--there is a royalty pool that we are sharing, but the percentage is not really--that's the questionable part, the percentage.
Story_ID: 522424
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to your career--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and you come--well--so you described you came back from Australia to Hawaii, you connected with your father [Mercer Ellington].  Then--from there you come back to New York [New York]?  And--and what do you do upon returning to New York?
Speaker 2: I come back to New York and I do shows here and there.  There used to be a revival series, which they still--well they don't have it now, at City Center [New York City Center, New York, New York].  So at City Center they used to don't--do shows like 'On the Town' [Adolph Green and Betty Comden] and I think they did--I did a show with Fosse [Bob Fosse], one of his shows, 'Pal Joey,' [John O'Hara], 'On the Town.'  I did--I think I did three revivals at City Center.  In the summer time I used to do Jones Beach, the Marine Theater [Jones Beach Marine Theater; Northwell Health at Jones Beach Theater, Wantagh, New York] at Jones Beach.  June Taylor had a huge show that they put on with Xavier Cugat and his orchestra--no, it wasn't Xavier Cugat.  It was Lu- God, can't remember the guy, he had a yacht and he was a musician and he would put his musicians on the yacht and they would play and they'd stop.  Because there was--the way the Jones Beach Marine Theater is constructed is that you have this huge audience amphitheater.  Then you had a fore--what they call a forestage which action could happen on, and then there was this water and the water led--and there were pontoons that led to the main--what they call the main stage.  And the main stage had action on it and the forestage had action on it, so it was like a huge thing.  I remember doing a show about a Hawaiian island.  They imported a Hawaiian troupe of dancers and musicians for this show.  Guy Lombardo, that's who did it.  Guy Lombardo and his orchestra.  And another show I did with Joel Grey ['Mardi Gras,' Sig Herzig]. 'Around the World in Eighty Days' ['Around the World,' Orson Welles].  And there was another show that I did, I can't remember the name of it.  So I became acquainted with June Taylor in that aspect and so I would come and audition and I would get those shows. A lot of dancers, a lot of singers.
Story_ID: 522425
Speaker 1: And then there was the year that somebody asked me, 'Well aren't you going to audition for 'The Jackie Gleason Show'" because June Taylor was also the choreographer for 'The Jackie Gleason Show.'  And I said, "Are you kidding (laughter), you know, there are no people, there are no people of color on that show, there's hardly any people of color on television," except for there was Sammy Davis [Sammy Davis, Jr.] did have a show and Nat King Cole did have a show, but as far as chorus people, you know, every once in a while maybe Ed Sullivan used to have a show and you'd see one or two people of color in his show in the chorus.  So, this person who was a friend, a fellow dancer and she said, "Well I'm gonna go audition for the show, why don't you come over to my place and we'll go--I'll teach you the combination."  This was one year, I had--I mean ever--I used to audition for it, but then I got discouraged, I said what am I knocking my brains out for, I know I'm neve- never gonna get this.
Speaker 2: Well because you described that most dancers of color would go to all these auditions but get nothing?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So was there a change for you coming back from Australia, did--did--did that affect your ability to get work at all?
Speaker 1: I--I felt that I--my--my resume was being built up and if people saw that I had all of this experience that might have some effect on whether I got jobs or not.  Also because of these revivals and from my experience in Broadway shows that I could possibly have a better chance at getting these things.  But this--that was Broadway and this was television, and so that was the big difference.  I said well I--I--it was a cattle call, most of the time for the--for the--to audition for June Taylor Dancers on 'The Jackie Gleason Show' was a cattle call, and it was a courtesy and it was a union necessity.  Because even though June might have known the dancers she wanted and could've called them up and asked them to do the show, she had to have auditions.  She had to have first open auditions, then she had to have union auditions.  And so I would go to those auditions and learn a couple combinations and what really I think helped me a lot was one of the shows I did at City Center [New York City Center, New York, New York] called 'Pal Joey' [John O'Hara] had tap dancing in it.  And my tap dancing was weak and I did some tap dancing in this 'Pal Joey' and I knew that I would be a little be more prepared to do the tap dancing for the Gleason show since I at least had tap shoes (laughter), you know, because that was a big thing.  When you went to a tap audition and you did not have tap shoes, that was a clear indication that you were not a tap dancer, so you had to be sure to bring those tap shoes.  And I went to--to this friend's house in August on the roof with tile flooring and it was--it was like unbelievable situation, I mean you can--you can understand the heat that must've--must've been, but I was oblivious, I was ri- really into learning the combination.  And so she taught me the combination and so when I went to the audition I felt a little bit more up on things and could gather it faster, I could--and retain it (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because this was a call back and you had not gone to the first one?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did--I didn't go to the first one.  This is--so I went and there was--people kept getting eliminated.  There were a lot of people, there were maybe fifty people.  And as the day wore on people were eliminated and I knew a lot of the people who went there because this was like the ace job that you could get, this was the best job a dancer could ever get in New York [New York].  And I stayed and I stayed and I stayed and I felt very strange 'cause I thought that maybe they'd just forgotten about me and I was just there.  But then it was down to maybe eighteen people and 'cause I was cou- then I started counting after a lot of people left.  And she--she would dismiss maybe ten people at a time or something.  It--it's like that show on television, she ha- asked people to step forward and the ones that stepped forward were the ones that she eliminated and the ones that were left were the people she kept.
Story_ID: 522426
Speaker 1: I looked at--down the line and there was like maybe eighteen people left and I figured that maybe she [June Taylor] had forgotten about me, but then Gleason [Jackie Gleason] came in the room and he was--he had the producer, Jack Philbin and the director and a lot of reporters came in.  And they sat there and she put her head together with Gleason and they were talking for a moment amongst themselves and then she stood up and said--made the announcement, "Ladies you are the new June Taylor Dancers."  And there were two swings at that point because June Taylor Dancers are only sixteen people, and I--I remember like--I--I said well maybe I didn't hear her correctly or maybe again, maybe she just forgot about me.  But I was in the lineup and I was very--I don't know I kind of in a fog, I--I--I can't even think of how I felt.  I--I said well if this is true, that means I will have money to do this and do this, and I kept--I just started calculating in my head, I can pay my rent, I can do this, I can buy these--these shoes.  But then, she came and talked to me afterwards and she said, "If you're not--if you don't live up to this job, I'm go--I'm going to fire you--I'll fi-," because she--she had a habit of firing somebody every week anyway if they didn't live up to the job.  Because the thing was it was live TV, they never stopped for anybody, you could fall down and they wouldn't stop.  So what--it just had to be, you know, you just kept going and she said, "Well, this is it, you--you've, you know, you've become, but if I was you, I would maybe hone up on my tap dancing a little bit."  So what I would do after every rehearsal I would go around the corner, across the street and take an hour of tap da--tap lessons, and this was like practically every day.
Speaker 2: And how long were the rehearsals?
Speaker 1: All day, they were at ea- eight hours.  Usually eight hours.
Speaker 2: So you are cast, now you're the first and only African American in--in her group, correct?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: What does that mean?  Can you place this in context, 'cause it's television, it's live television, Jackie Gleason was a huge celebrity back then, was he not?
Speaker 1: Yes, very big, very big.  Now we're talking about JFK [President John Fitzgerald Kennedy] is president.  And during my first year tenure is when he was assa- assassinated.  And it was--I mean a lot of things were happening, politically and in the entertainment business with all of these people and the change of--of in the arts in general, not only in television but the concert stage, the opera stage, the ballet stage, where things were getting to be a little bit more equalized.  And--and here we had this guy--this wonderful guy in the office as the president who was actually concerned and interested in the arts and concerned with arts.  It was almost like you were living in a, you know, utopia for a moment.  And course after the assassination and everything else, you know, after that was.
Story_ID: 522427
Speaker 1: Being tapped as the first African American woman in this role, did you feel any extra pressure?
Speaker 2: Yes, I wa- I felt extra pressure because of the fact that I--my tap skills were not so great, but there was not--it wasn't a tap number every--every week.  So when she did a jazz number or a character number [on 'The Jackie Gleason Show'] or something like that, I was--I shined, you know, that was--that was really up my--right up my alley because as a June Taylor Dancer there's not only the tap challenge, but we had--we worked with xylophones, we worked with toy pianos, we worked with banjos, we worked with musical instruments as well.
Speaker 1: You played them?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: While dancing?
Speaker 2: Yes and it was--it was ridiculous.  I mean Wayne Newton was a guest and--and Jackie Gleason loved Wayne Newton and I think that Jackie Gleason had a lot to do with boosting Wayne Newton's career.  And he had him on the show a few times.  So whenever he was on the show, here we go with our banjos, you know.  And the banjo is like one of the hardest stringed instrument to play.  And then once we had xylophones, I forget who was that--who that was for, but I remember chalking in one of the notes on the xylophone, it was a wooden instrument and chalking it in because we had a step that we did with a shuffle ball change and a turn and then we had to hit the note, and I said after we hit the note, you know, I'm like this, I--I was looking down to see the chalk so I could find the right note to hit, 'cause each of us had a different note.  The toy pianos was--was Liberace.  Liberace was another favorite and because.  So--so we actually had sometimes two numbers for every show, and we always had the opening number which preceded Jackie Gleason's entrance.  And then sometimes we had two numbers.  And then they did the musical "Honeymooners" ["The Honeymooners"] that had a lot of music and a lot of dancing all through, it was like a mini musical.  And Ar- that was Art Carney came back to be in those, Sheila MacRae and Betty--and here I go with the names again, Betty was playing the part of--was it Trixie--
Speaker 1: Betty Currie?
Speaker 2: No, Betty--Betty Kean, Betty Kean.  'Cause she--she was part of a sister act at one point.  But, we had these musical "Honeymooners" and we even had times when they would hire June Taylor Dancer men, who would--so we would have partners, we would do partner dancing with the guys.
Speaker 1: And so how were you treated by the cast and crew and production team?
Speaker 2: Not special at all, nothing special at all.  The--because we had--we were working so hard and practicing so much for--for the things, they had to be absolutely perfect.  You have to understand that a precision dancer is like a soldier.  The Rockettes, it's the same thing.  There are thirty-two of them, there were only sixteen of us.  And we--we had to do exactly, we had to be exactly alike.  Each of us was one-sixteenth of a person, and that's not an easy thing.  Because when you come from a dancer's point of view, your expression as a dancer is an individual kind of a thing, but that was not encouraged.  You were actually encouraged to be just like the person in front and back and on either side of you to do your arms the same way, your head the same way, and there was no other way about it.  You just--that was it.
Speaker 1: Were there any show boaters in that?
Speaker 2: No.  Not really.  But I--I can't--I mean I think about and I don't know how I got through it.  I think about it now and I say how did you do that?  We had a precision number with ten-speed bikes, bi- bicycles, ten on the stage sixteen.  When we did arabesque we had--what one leg up and we did all these things and twisting around and stuff.  I didn't even know how to ride a bike, you know, I'm--I was from, what did I know?  Now people ride bikes in the city, but in my day, not a lot of people ro- rode bikes.

Speaker 1: How old were you when you were doing this show ['The Jackie Gleason Show']?
Speaker 2: Oh God, twenty-something, twenty--yeah.
Speaker 1: And how lo- how long did this show last?
Speaker 2: Well, one year in New York [New York] and then Gleason [Jackie Gleason] decided to move to Miami Beach [Florida].  So, I think I was there for maybe five or six seasons there, and so--
Speaker 1: Now is a season a year?
Speaker 2: A season a year, yeah.  And the seasons then, the television seasons then were like thirty-two weeks, they were much longer than the series that ar--are now.
Speaker 1: 'The Jackie Gleason Show' then was when, career wise, you started making money?
Speaker 2: Absolutely, yeah.  Making money and making--and earning weeks for unemployment, you know.
Speaker 1: And that was important, why?
Speaker 2: Well it was important for me because I'd never been able to have a steady salary doing what I wanted to do, being a dancer.  And I what a--I was going hog wild.  I didn't know how to handle money.  So June Taylor took me by the hand to the bank and she opened up a bank account for me, and she said now you put in a certain amount of money in this bank account every week and I'm going to see to it that you do that.  So she took a personal int- interest in me and because I mean I--I was--I would've gone crazy buying clo- clothes, shoes, everything.
Speaker 1: And this is in--I just wanna see what year, do you know what the years were of that?
Speaker 2: I know that, ah let's see, I was coming--
Speaker 1: Sixty-three [1963]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When it started.  So what--do you remember what your salary was?
Speaker 2: A hundred fifty-five dollars and something cents a week.
Speaker 1: And that is compared to what--when you did other things, what were--what were you making?
Speaker 2: Well I can't--I can't remember the minimum for chorus, it was--it was not a hundred, it was like less than--maybe eighty, seventy, seventy-five dollars a week, something like that, seventy-five, sixty-six, something like that.  So a hundred fifty-five dollars a week, you know, big jump.

Speaker 1: How did your father [Mercer Ellington] and your grandfather [Duke Ellington] react to you being on the show ['The Jackie Gleason Show']?
Speaker 2: Well, my, my grandfather--I understood later on that my grandfather and Gleason [Jackie Gleason] were supposed to write an opera together.  So they must've known each other from sometime.  I knew Gleason was always interested in big bands and in big band music.  And he did compose, he was a composer.  Even though he didn't know how to write music, but he did compose the theme to "The Honeymooners."  And they did--Gleason did a big band show while we were in Miami Beach [Florida] and all of the big bands were on it.  It was an incredible show, only he could've managed something like this.  And the Duke Ellington Orchestra was one of the--one of the--of the bands, the Count Basie Orchestra was--the Dorsey band [Tommy Dorsey Orchestra], the--every--I mean these people--I mean it wa- it was insane.  I went down to meet my father, 'cause by this time my father was in the band, went down to meet my father at the airport and the turntable where all the luggage comes out, you should see--nothing but instruments.  There was, you know, trumpets and there was trombones and saxophones and things coming around in the turntable, it was--it was amazing.  And I remember Paul Gonsalves--Paul Gonsalves was my--my father's like--almost like my--my father's best friend in the band and they used to hang together for many reasons.  My father took care of Paul because Paul, maybe it was his blood sugar, but he would get drunk like that, I mean in a moment's notice.  And his position in the band was right next to the piano so that he didn't fall off the chair onto the floor, which he had done.  So he'd be leaning up against the piano rather than falling down.
Speaker 1: And what did he play?
Speaker 2: Saxophone.  Alt--not alto, yeah alto sax.
Speaker 1: So he would be drunk on stage performing?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And he could play.  And that's the story about 'Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue' [Duke Ellington].  Di- the length of that piece was to keep Paul playing.  Ellington wanted to play him until he got sober, 'cause he was not sober at the beginning, but he was sober by the end of it.  The longest solo, I think, in history or something.

Speaker 1: So you are now doing the show, you're on television, which even though you're part of this ensemble, it certainly is raising your profile?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What effect does 'The Jackie Gleason Show' have on your career for next--when that's finished?
Speaker 2: Well, for dancers, maybe for dancers, I don't know whether it was for people of color who were dancers, or the chorus, what the deal was, but you--the end of one job, that's the end of it, and that's something that you can put on your resume and--but it might have absolutely nothing to do with the next job.  Now for me, when I ended up my job as a June Taylor Dancer, someone who--one of my mentors, Donald Saddler, had been visiting Miami--Miami Beach [Florida] and had known June Taylor and he also was a part of the Harkness Foundation [Rebekah Harkness Foundation; Harkness Foundation for Dance, New York, New York] which were people who were involved--Rebekah Harkness established scholarships and things for dancers, for ballet people.  And I think they had a company, the Harkness company, ballet company [Harkness Ballet].  But Donald Saddler came down and we were friends, we made friends and he said to me, "I'm gonna be doing a show in New York [New York], you have to come and audition."  So, as it turns out the show was 'No, No, Nanette' [Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel].  And when I auditioned for the show, I--I made--I made it, I was also the only person of color in that show.  And this is--now we're talking about Broadway.  And Ruby Keeler was the star of the show.  And I knew it was gonna be a tap show and so did Donald, and Donald said because of my experience with the June Taylor Dancers and tap, and in precision dancing and stuff like that he was gonna have somewhat of a line, the same kind of a thing that he wanted me to help.  So I became like a--one of his assistants as well.  He had about three assistants.  And Busby Berkeley, himself--they booked, they billed us all, the chorus, as the Busby Berkeley Girls, because the producer, Cyma Rubin, wanted to be as authentic as possible and with hairdos, with costumes, with lighting, with everything, makeup.  And she knew that, you know, she wa- she was like one of the first, if not the only female producer of her time.  And it became such a big hit, it was such an incredible hit and nobody knew that it wasn't--at that time you went out of town, you had out of town tryouts and then you came back.  And there was a circuit, Boston [Massachusetts], Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and I can't remember the third city, it was three different places where you went before you hit New York.  But early on in one of our tryouts out of town when the audience saw Ruby Keeler coming down this double staircase in her tap shoes they started applauding and they didn't stop and that's when the producer made the decision to come straight into New York rather than go to the third city that we were supposed to try out.  And we were the underdogs when we left.  We didn't even have a theater to come back into.  But out on the road, I guess certain shows closed or other theater owners pushed other shows out, but we had a--we had a--it was then called, it was the 46th st- Street Theatre [46th Street Theatre; Richard Rodgers Theatre, New York, New York] on 46th [Street].
Story_ID: 522431
Speaker 1: So you were part of television and then now Broadway--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at a time when the way dance is being presented and documented is--is being fine-tuned?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you describe what the experience was like in terms of how--how--what chore- choreography was looking like and also the filming of it?
Speaker 2: Well, I know that when we were in--in Miami Beach [Florida] and the camera angles were not so much discussed, but June Taylor made very sure that the camera angles were flattering to the legs of the--of the girls [June Taylor Dancers].  Now you also have to now that there was a certain censorship that was going around so we could not show a high leg line.  Our costumes had to be kind of like old-to-old fashion bathing suit costumes.  She gradually edged them up a li- over the years, but in the beginning we were not allowed to have much of a high leg line and she wanted to do a straight on master shot and no--nothing from below--nothing--no fancy stuff except for the kaleidoscope shot, which was when we--when we all laid down the floor and created those designs, like the Busby Berkeley type of movement and we all welcomed those--that portion of the dance because we got to lay down on the floor and breathe.  Because those--the tempos that Gleason [Jackie Gleason] insisted that music was much faster than the Rockettes.  I mean the Rockettes were, you know, they had a chance like very nicely kick their--we were going like fire kicking our legs in the last kick line and moving like fury, I mean it was just fast, fast music.  And when it came to the--to--to the overhead camera, the--the--the technology of that was very, very new as it applied to television.  I mean they had been doing it in the movies, but when it came to television, overhead shots were unheard of.  So they rigged--the way the rigged the camera they couldn't decide whether they were gonna do a reverse shot so that the lens--there was something about the lens being reversed when it was in the overhead position as to when it was a regular camera that was used face on.  And she was very, very pa- particular about not--the censorship of the costumes and the length of--so our crotches wouldn't be shown.  And also very particular about the camera showing a flattering picture of our legs.  So straight on shots as opposed to like a below or an angular shot, or not--not too fancy with the--with the--with the camera because she wanted her work to be shown.  So when you get involved with all of these camera angles, I get--I get frustrated now show--watching television and dance shows, watching television when the camera guy gets so involved with his work and his artistry that he forgets that the actual steps and the, you know, the dance, itself, is--is just kind of second, you know, thought on a second hand.
Speaker 1: I saw in a documentary about dance that Fred Astaire said--made the requirement that whenever he was on stage it had to be a full body shot, that there could never be--
Speaker 2: Cut, yeah.
Speaker 1: --a cut in because he wanted the whole dance to be seen (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.  Because his--his creation of the type of dance that he did which was a combination of ballroom and tap.  His lines were very important and he wore tails most of the time, many times, and even in tuxedos the lines that he made were complete with his costume and could only be seen as a whole body shot.  Because if you got partial shot, it didn't give you the information and it didn't portray him.  And he was a reg- a ra- a rather short guy and it didn't give him the length that he needed, you know, for effect.
Story_ID: 522432
Speaker 1: You're now doing 'No, No, Nanette' [Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel]--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and this is your first Broadway show, is that correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you talk about the preparation, and you've already explained that it was truncated, your--your tour before coming to Broadway because it was so popular.  What was the time leading up to opening on Broadway once the decision was made that you would come?
Speaker 2: Well, once the decision--we, you know, it was like your bags real quick, just get on that train, come right back down and start loading into the theater.  And it was the most detailed and--and minutest situation because the producer was so--she was determined that she would do a complete re-enactment of the period.  She did not wanna do a takeoff on the period or a parody of the period, she wanted to do a complete re- she had Bergdorf Goodman hairdressers for our--to do our hair.  She sent people, we had appointments--regular appointments to go to Bergdorf Goodman to do our hair.  And this was like unheard of.  She hired a makeup artist to design the makeup according to the lights that she asked for, which were almost like the old fashioned footlights of the old theaters, and there had to be special li- makeup for that and if you--when we went out in to the street like in between shows to get something to--we looked like we were battered women because most of the colors that she used were purple and pink.  So purple and pink face and you know, all of the highlights and all the shading all the--the stuff that we used and it's like incredible.  The innovative things that were happening with that show and she--I--I don't know except for something like 'Cats' [Andrew Lloyd Webber] where people are required to look like cats, you know.  But we were all required to look the same--have the same period makeup, hair and comportment.  There was a time when one of our rehearsals, the script was not finished when we went into rehearsal.  Now usually the script is finished and so people, it was so frustrating for the principals because they had no words to learn.  So what my--what my mentor, Donald Saddler, what he did, he and the director Burt Shevelove, they both created these scenarios and had us walk into a room together arm and arm, and it was behavioral thing.  So it was, you know, not hitting somebody, not--no high fives, no nothing like that.  All of this the stuff was period.  Sitting down at a table, getting up, going over to talk to another group, walking this way, walking that way.  And the gestures that you did.  Not that they should be, you know, cartoonish or anything, but that they should look natural and you should look comfortable doing them.  And we did that until it beca- became a part of us and that we looked comfortable doing it.
Speaker 1: How was 'No, No, Nanette' received on Broadway?
Speaker 2: Full houses, full houses.
Speaker 1: And the theater sat how many people, do you know?
Speaker 2: It was--it's a small theater [46th Street Theatre, New York, New York], it's a smallish theater, it's actually probably the smallest Broadway theater, because it's--I think it's called the Richard Rodgers, they may have changed the name again, but it was changed to the Richard Rodgers Theatre [New York, New York], now I don't know what the name of it is.
Speaker 1: How--how long was the run?
Speaker 2: We ran for two years, I think it was two years.
Story_ID: 522433
Speaker 1: So at this point, you're in a Broadway play ['No, No, Nanette,' Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel] that--that's a good run--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --full house, this is now union?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So did you--did you join the union before because you were on TV or when--when did you join?
Speaker 2: The first time I joined a union was the Australian version of Actors Equity [Actors' Equity Association].  And that was not even full credit, they only took a portion of that for your credits to be a union member, because at that time you had to accrue a certain amount of Broadway experience to be a member of the union.  But what I did have was AFTRA [American Federation of Television and Radio Artists; Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)], which was the television union, I had those credits and not all of them even from being a June Taylor Dancer.  And those credits were also considered when you join other unions, it's like a mutual kind of a thing.  So there's AFTRA, there's what became SAG [Screen Actors Guild; Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA)], AGMA [American Guild of Musical Artists], AGVA [American Guild of Variety Artists] and they--there were different categories of different things.  Like one was a--the union for opera and concerts.  One was the union for variety shows and nightclubs.  And then there was SAG, of course film.
Speaker 1: So being in the--which--which union would affect Broadway?
Speaker 2: That's Actors' Equity.
Story_ID: 522434
Speaker 1: And being in 'No, No, Nanette' [Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel] and this was in 1971.  Do you remember what your pay was for that?
Speaker 2: It might have been two hundred, could've been something like two hundred [dollars].  Some--I--because I thought I had saved a stub, I wanted to save a stub so that I can remember what that was like.  Once again, it's eight shows a week, grueling, absolutely grueling schedule and so you had no life other than that.  And it was, but it became a way of life.  And I think the reason that it closed was because of Ruby [Ruby Keeler].  There was a--there was a building up of some feelings with Ruby and the producer, and I'm not clear on--on what the relationships were, but I know that in--in--in the scope of things, Cyma Rubin had so much to handle on her own--
Speaker 1: That's the producer?
Speaker 2: Yeah, and she made a lot of enemies, she made a lot of enemies not only within the circle of her own show, but also Broadway because they felt, you know, she was just out of realm, making demands.
Speaker 1: Was this possibly because she was a woman?
Speaker 2: I think p- part of it was.  She, you know, she broke the--the gender line as being a sole producer and she was the sole producer because her husband happened to be very, very, very, very, very, very wealthy.  And so he was responsible for her independence.
Speaker 1: And my understanding is that even when you have money, they can or cannot allow you to use it to--to be the producer, so they were able to do that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, at that time.  I mean I don't--I don't know there're probably some other smaller producers and other people who can put money in individually and as groups of producers who did that.  Because nowadays when you go see a show, you look at the Playbill, above the title is a list of producers, it's like almost a full page.  The cost of putting on a show now is so much more than it was.
Speaker 1: At that point, this is 1971 when it started, this is now when the Virginia Slims ads are out.  You know, women, Gloria Steinem is in full effect.  The women's movement is very prominent at the moment that this play is being made, and I'm curious, do you remember what was happening around you as it relates to women and empowerment?
Speaker 2: Not so much.  I--it was just a totally, that's the crazy thing about this business, when you are involved, I don't think it might be the same now, but then when you're involved and you're lucky enough to get a show that, you know, is running and the advance is--is great.  You know, when you have an advance sales that is substantial and you can count on that, you know.  Your concern with other things is minimal except your concern is what's my next job?  Where am I going next, what am I gonna do next.  Is it possible to make this turn into something for me?  Nowadays I think people are really in--interested in starting their own business.  Like they're--they're turning it into something that they can then get the attention of buyers or backers or producers for their own benefit for their own projects and developing their own projects.  In that day, I think people were just interested in going from one, one show to another show to another show.
Story_ID: 522435
Speaker 1: What was your next show?
Speaker 2: The next show after that--after 'No, No, Nanette' [Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel] was not until--well I did do one, I just forgot about it.  'The Night that Made America Famous' was a Harry Chapin show which was very, very short lived, and after that was 'Sophisticated Ladies,' the saga of 'Sophisticated Ladies.'
Speaker 1: But so before 'Sophisticated Ladies,' 'cause that came after your [paternal] grandfather [Duke Ellington] passed away.  So he died in '74 [1974]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Which me--was he able to see you in 'No, No, Nanette'?
Speaker 2: As a matter of fact he did (laughter).  He came to see me with my great aunt [Ruth Ellington Boatwright].  And he had no idea, he was late.  I think he came, maybe it was in the second act.  He missed a lot of the show and he expected me to have a starring role.  And so when he saw me in the chorus he was very disappointed.  Now they--they made room for the two of them because it was a sold-out show, so they put extra seats in the back for them to sit in the aisle.  And I guess he was so disappointed to see that I was not being Josephine Baker, you know.  But it was a job.
Story_ID: 522436
Speaker 1: Tell me about his [Ellington's paternal grandfather, Duke Ellington] death?
Speaker 2: In the hospital.  The wall--there was one wall completely filled with cards and letters and communications from people who were sending best wishes.  I think they stopped bringing in flowers and plants and things like that.  Because I remember being told, you know, to take plants out.  And he had a phone right by--by the bed and because people were calling him too.  He had--it was right by the bed--the foot of his bed, the phone.  And he was able to sit up at that point and also go to the bathroom, and--
Speaker 1: How long was he ill?
Speaker 2: Well in the hospital ill, it was not a long time, maybe a couple weeks.  Because I was scheduled to go out west to--to--on a trip, and so before I went, I--I went to visit him in the hospital.  And as a matter of fact, I went to visit him in the hospital and when I got ready to go on my trip I was on the plane and I was reading the newspaper over somebody--somebody's shoulder that he had died.  So he died while I was on my way out west, and I turned around and came back for the funeral, which was quite something at St. John the Divine [Cathedral of Saint John the Divine, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: What do you remember of it?
Speaker 2: Oh, I just--a lot of dignitaries were there, Basie [Count Basie] was there.  It was a really gray day and I was sitting with my father [Mercer Ellington] and my stepmother [Lene Scheid Ellington], and Edward [Edward Ellington II] and Gaye [Gaye Ellington].  And there were a lot of musicians there, whoever was left of the band.  Because the band members had been dying off as well during this, you know, this period of time.  'Cause ev- every time I'd go out to Woodlawn [Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York], there's this tour of all of the jazz greats that are buried there and many of them are members of the--of the Ellington Orchestra [Duke Ellington Orchestra].  And a lot of people request to be buried near him as well.
Speaker 1: Your--your father took over the orchestra after--
Speaker 2: Yes.  They had a date--they had a date the day after he died and so all the funeral arrangements were being made by a friend of the family.  And I can't remember, he's a big, big guy up at--I mean he's--he's very famous up in Harlem [New York, New York] as a funeral--he buries all the stars and everybody.  But my father had a gig with the--with the orchestra and he took them, it was some remote place.  But I--I remember that he was very intent on making the gig, because from that point on he just wanted people to understand that just because Duke Ellington passed away, the Duke Ellington Orchestra was still gonna be going on.
Story_ID: 522437
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, you are performing, I guess is it primarily Broadway that you're doing?  'The Night that Made America Famous' [Harry Chapin] then 'The Grand Tour' [Michael Stewart and Mark Bramble]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: 'Happy New Year' [Burt Shevelove], these are all Broadway productions?
Speaker 2: Broadway, they were all Broadway, not necessarily on Broadway, because 'The Grand Tour' never got back from and--back from San Francisco [California].  That was with Joel Grey.  And but the rest of them are, I mean that was--that was a big gap because the next Broadway show after 'Nanette' ['No, No, Nanette' Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel] was 'Sophisticated Ladies' and that was my father [Mercer Ellington] leading the band [Duke Ellington Orchestra].  So he had gone out on tour with the band and they--it was a really big struggle to--between the musicians that were leaving the band after Ellington [Duke Ellington] died and between dates being dropped.  My father had a really hard time keeping--keeping them together.  But he did and he toured them.  And then there was this guy, Manny Fox [Manheim Fox] of the Fox brothers, there's Charles Fox [ph.], Manny Fox.  Manny Fox had an idea about the show that he wanted to do and it was supposed to be a show about the orchestra and it was 'Sophisticated Ladies.'  But in the development of the show, it was changed.  First it was supposed to be about the orchestra, then it was in tro- we were in trouble from the very beginning.  We had about three or four different choreographers.  We had two different directors.  Donny McKayle [HistoryMaker Donald McKayle] was the first person who was supposed to be choreographing and directing, and it was really a--a lot for him to do.  And John Gayer [ph.] was writing the book.  And the book ended up being practically totally thrown out.  So this story--so-called story of the orchestra just turned out to be a review with the band on stage instead of being in the pit.  The band was on stage and so they became an intricate part of the action.  Dancers and singers were all--and the--the design of the set was very unique.  Tony Walton did a great job of, of the set.  And so all of the band members were on stage.
Story_ID: 522438
Speaker 1: Now this is in 1981?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So, just between 1972 when you left 'No, No, Nanette' [Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel] and 1981, what are you doing for work?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I'm--I'm trying to remember.  There was a time when I was, I got a Christmas job and--and I'm trying to figure out when that was.  Oh god that was--there was another show called--[HistoryMaker] Oscar Brown, Jr. did this show ['Kicks & Co.'] and Burgess Meredith was in it, and we never got back from Chicago [Illinois].  I can't remember the name of it.
Speaker 1: But--but I guess the sense of it--what--actors, dancers, performers, as you say you're doing your--whatever gig you're doing and then--with an eye out for what is the next one.  How do you manage when there's a lot of space in between?
Speaker 2: Unemployment, unemployment.  So, you know, your weeks work for you.  You--you try.  I mean there wasn't--there was a time when I did have a regular job as a salesperson in B. Altman's [B. Altman and Company] at Christmas time.  I was on the flying squad.  But I ended up being so fierce at selling scarves they kept me at the scarf counter.  And my--my clientele, I had a celebrity clientele of one, which was Kate Smith.  And she came in and I say she was a star for me because she ended up buying scarves for everybody she knew, and I had to put them together and pack them up, and she wanted me to pick them out and so and she left with a stack of--stack of scar--scarves for her Christmas presents.  And that was when I got acquainted with the rice and my diet of rice and Hershey bar.
Speaker 1: Which is interesting, because it's after a lot of success?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Which people don't always realize--
Speaker 2: With the ups and downs, you know, here today, gone tomorrow.  You're never really sure about that next show.  And this is why I think that the current--the current habit for people to do or what--what they--is--is to go and establish their own businesses.  It doesn't matter what it is, it could be in the stationary business, it could be designing cars, it could be any little thing whether it's related to show business or not, but at least they have something to keep them floating until the next thing.

Speaker 1: Well what your [paternal] grandfather [Duke Ellington] told Tony Bennett.
Speaker 2: Yes, always have two things--or you can always do two things.  Just one thing to offset the other thing and you--it keeps you fresh on both.
Speaker 1: Have you had two things?
Speaker 2: Well, I feel like I've had two things, maybe sometimes even more than two things.  But I'm involved with a lot of foundations and doing work for--on boards.  The Louis Armstrong, the Career Transition for Dancers, Actors Fund [The Actors Fund].  There's so many people like Tony Waag and his American Tap Dance Foundation [New York, New York].  And they just--any--anybody--any place that I can help I kind of, you know, try to keep attached to them so that, and it doesn't--those things don't pay (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Yes, but these are not for profit.
Speaker 2: Those are the--
Speaker 1: So that's out of the goodness of your heart.
Speaker 2: That I--yeah, that's how I keep busy.
Story_ID: 522440
Speaker 1: And things that bring money to me come far and few.  Like the last job that I had, a couple years ago I did a show at the York Theatre [New York, New York] called 'Storyville' ['Storyville: A Jazzy Musical of Old New Orleans,' Ed Bullins], and it was a big, big success.  Not a lot of money because it was at the York Theatre, it's a, you know, again a very small theater.  But it--it was--I was very proud of it because it--I got to do a lot and it was right up my alley as far as accrued information from New Orleans [Louisiana] and it just, you know, I di--it was--it was--it was a great thing.  And also, the thing is when you have something going or a show going, you wanna invite agents.  I have never managed to have an agent, because I never had enough work for an agent to say well this is what she did.  Because when you have an agent, first of all you have to pay them a portion of your salary no matter what.  Even--I had an agent once that Donald Saddler gave me his agent.  So we shared this agent and I had to give her a percentage of whatever I did whether she got the show for me or not.  And I, you know, you may think it's not fair, but at least it's something that she sees that I am still workable, that I still can get jobs.  And in that way, it's kind of an investment.  But really there's no--there's nothing that I've done except this now renewed interest in ballroom dancing, which also does not bring in heaps of money.  If you are in the winning--like the first price--first--first-place prize, it's--it's a check.  And once I did place and I got a check, not first place, but I--I got a check for like $150 or something like that.  But, you know I pick up something here and there or somebody will ask me to help them with their act, cabaret acts, staging, things like that, and they'll give me a, you know, certain amount of money.  But it's not really, you know, things ain't what they used to be.
Story_ID: 522441
Speaker 1: I'd like for you to describe 'Sophisticated Ladies.' What it became?
Speaker 2: Okay, 'Sophisticated Ladies'--any Broadway show that gets put together in a traditional way, the participants become a family.  You go through rehearsal times, you go through performance times.  You spend most of your time together, even if you have a regular traditional family, but most of the days, work days are spent with these people.  Even after you open on Broadway and your running time that you spend with people is two and a half hours to, maybe three.  With 'Sophisticated Ladies' it became a family from the time we came into rehearsals and the very first day of rehearsals we kind of glommed towards each other for many reasons.  For safety reasons, because the producers had a kind of hands-off attitude about how things were being done and there were a lot of people involved with putting together that show that really didn't know what they were doing.  And for safety's sake, we--we choreographed ourselves sometimes.  We took care of certain decisions of--of what we would wear, how we would wear things.  Willa Kim was the costume person who was an incredibly gifted and imaginative costume person.  And she was out the box when it came to figuring these costume designs.  I mean it was just incredible.  And again, everybody thought well, you know, she's--she's not thinking of practical situations even though she had designed for ballet companies, but we--we were thinking about an eight--eight-show week, how we would have to put ourselves in these costumes and get out of these costumes, and sometimes they were very fast changes, which you sometimes don't get in a ballet company.  In a ballet company one piece is shown, another piece is shown, but within the piece there's very few times when an individual has to make a fast change to get out of one costume and into another.  And in my case, I was involved in thirty-two numbers in that show and sometimes I had to--I was changing, I hardly ever saw my dressing room.  I was changing in the wings.  I was getting--and this was like from shoes to everything, underwear.  You have to have no qualms at all about the stagehands seeing your whole bare body, because there you were for all the world to see.
Speaker 1: And did you have a dresser?  Was there someone helping you?
Speaker 2: There was--there--you--no, the chorus didn't have individual dressers, you had one dresser for the entire chorus.  So I sometimes grabbed somebody, sometimes one of the stagehands was helping me get dressed in the wings and it was like, you know, as long as I made it in time, I was okay, which stays with me to this day in getting and preparing, putting shoes on, putting whatever, your hose, your stockings, whatever you--your wearing.  It--it was--it was very important that you knew exactly what you needed, you had everything, and you check your makeup you check your hair, whatever head dress you have to put on, it was all supposed to be very tidy and very much in place every single time you had to do it, and twice on Wednesdays and Saturday.
Speaker 1: Who was the cast?
Speaker 2: There were people like Hinton Battle in the chorus and--Hinton Battle wasn't in the chorus, Hinton Battle and Gregg Burge, P.J. Benjamin and Terri Klausner, they were the principles, sub-principles, big star was Gregory Hines.  Gregory Hines and Phyllis Hyman.  Phyllis Hyman and Judy Jamison [HistoryMaker Judith Jamison], and this was Jud- Judith Jamison's first foray into show business after she left the Ailey Company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater].  So people were interested.  Her fans were interested in seeing her.
Speaker 1: She was a huge star in Ailey.
Speaker 2: Very huge.  So they wanted to see what she was doing.  Phyllis Hyman had a--an incredible following from the recording industry.  Gregory Hines was everybody's sweetheart.  I mean these were people, and we even had Priscilla Baskerville who did--ended up not doing very much because the operatic and classical part of the show got cut because of time.  But P.J. Benjamin had been a popular Broadway person.  Terri Klausner had been in 'Evita' [Tim Rice].  She was the matinee 'Evita' with Patti LuPone.  And Gregg Burge was--was in 'The Wiz' [William F. Brown] and Hinton Battle was in--both Hinton Battle and Gregg Burge were in Broadway shows all the time.  And Gregg Burge was also an incredible tap dancer.
Story_ID: 522442
Speaker 1: So you have a- an all-star cast?
Speaker 2: Yes, yeah.
Speaker 1: How is the play ['Sophisticated Ladies'] received?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Another emergency thing.  We--we--we were putting it together and changing it.  We were rehearsing one show in the day and doing--performing another show at night.  So we didn't have time, even after the rehearsal period, we didn't have enough time to make the necessary changes and change material.  I mean songs were being thrown out and new songs were being introduced.  And ultimately, it became Gregory's [Gregory Hines] undoing, because they were changing the script out of town so much so that he couldn't learn everything to put in.  They wanted him to put in new material every single day and he explained to them, he said I will get the new material in as soon as I can, but I can't every night do--rehearse one show in the day and do another completely different show at night.  It was just ridiculous, you know.
Speaker 1: And who's the they, who--who's the--
Speaker 2: The producers, the producers.  People like Berlind, Roger Berlind, Larry--Harry--Harry Litwin [sic. Burton L. Litwin], Manny Fox [Manheim Fox], oh who's the woman who's very, very popular--well Louise Westergaard, she passed away, but there's another woman who is very--she's still around and she's still a producer.  But there were five main producers.  And Sondra Gilman, that's the one, Sondra Gillman, Louise Westergaard, Roger Berlind, Manny Fox and Harry.
Speaker 1: So now even though it was tumultuous (laughter), it lasted for quite a while, did it not?
Speaker 2: It lasted for quite a while.  But you have to understand, when we were in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania], and this is one incident, when we were in Philadelphia, we left town without costumes being finished.  The costumes were not finished.  So we were--we were doing numbers in rehearsal clothes on stage for audience paying to see a performance.  In the middle of some--this was--one number called "Caravan," and we were all dressed as aviators in these beautiful white satin aviator costumes with goggles and things, as we are doing the show, the dressers and the wardrobe people are on the train coming down with the costumes in their boxes.  And so just prior to the number going on, we are heatedly opening up the boxes and putting these costumes on only to find, for instance mine, the zipper that was supposed to be zipped up front was on the diagonal, it was a big mistake, I couldn't--I fit--I put the thing on and they said no you can't go on with that, so they took them out and we went on with our rehearsal clothes again, because there were mistakes in the costumes, they put the zippers in incorrectly.  And they would do this all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) This was ongoing through the whole run?
Speaker 2: This was on--no for just about a week, until it gave time, they had time to get everything together.  I think by the time we had our last week's performance in Philadelphia, everything was cool.
Story_ID: 522443
Speaker 1: But they put a lot of pressure on Gregory [Gregory Hines] to learn the new material and they fired him, they ended up firing him.  And his understudies were Gregg Burge and Hinton Battle.
Speaker 2: So he was fired before it ['Sophisticated Ladies'] got to Broadway?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Fired him.  He went down to Penn Station [Pennsylvania Station, New York, New York] and everybody else heard about him being fired, all the rest of the cast members.  Phyllis Hyman, Terri Klausner and the rest of us were crying our eyes out.  This was before a Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] performance, the house is packed, they're holding the show.  Phyllis and Terri cried so much they lost their voices, they cried their voices out, they couldn't sing.  The producers went down to the station to bring Gregory back.  Because the rest of the cast, we all said we are not doing the show without Gregory.  And they--so they went down and they brought Gregory back, but they had to send that audience home.  But the next night, Gregory was in the show, everything was sort of but kind of back to normal and we did the--we did a show.
Speaker 2: And then did he stay?
Speaker 1: He stayed.  And he br- he opened with us--opened up on Broadway.
Story_ID: 522444
Speaker 1: Tremendous hit ['Sophisticated Ladies'].  Everybody was just, you know, beaming because of the reception that we got, the reviews.  It was, you know, it was assured that we were gonna have a--a good run.  So--
Speaker 2: And you had 767 performances?
Speaker 1: Yeah (laughter).
Speaker 2: Wh- over what period of time is that?
Speaker 1: That's over two--is it two years, not quite, not quite two years.  Yeah, yeah it was two years and some.  And the reason being, after Gregory [Gregory Hines] left to do something, I think that he realized he was sick and he left the show and Maurice [HistoryMaker Maurice Hines, Jr.] came in, his brother came in, to take his place.  And there were some changes that were made in the material, but it was still a good show, it was still bringing people in.
Story_ID: 522445
Speaker 1: During this period, because your father [Mercer Ellington] was part of the show ['Sophisticated Ladies'], correct?
Speaker 2: Yes, he was leading the band.
Speaker 1: So the Duke Ellington band [Duke Ellington Orchestra] was part of the show, so that's where they were performing every day?
Speaker 2: Yes, but you see, the--the regular tradition of Broadway shows is that the musicians have to be part of the Broadway union of musicians.  And so there was a question as to whether they were going to allow my father to bring in the Duke Ellington Orchestra without having each member of the Duke Ellington Orchestra band join the union.  And if they had done that, they wouldn't not have really--they guys couldn't afford to do that.  So, what they ended up doing is hiring the band as a novelty act.  They hired the Duke Ellington Orchestra as a novelty act and then they were allowed to be performing on stage.
Story_ID: 522446
Speaker 1: So then the, the show ['Sophisticated Ladies'] ends.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: And then does the orchestra [Duke Ellington Orchestra] go back on the road?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And, and you then become an entrepreneur?
Speaker 2: Well, somewhat.
Speaker 1: Wh--what did you do?
Speaker 2: I--I started--what was--what the year was--
Speaker 1: Eighty-three [1983].
Speaker 2: Eighty-three [1983].  Somewhere along that time was the plan for re- the renovation of 125th Street, the Harlem Empowerment Zone [sic.].  And I decided that--
Speaker 1: Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.
Speaker 2: Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone.  And a friend of mine, Howard Porter convinced me to establish a Duke Ellington presence on 125th Street, a physical presence.  And so this was the establishment of this Duke Ellington Center for the Arts [New York, New York].  It was originally supposed to be a physical place, but it ended up being not a physical place because there was so much red tape to get a physical spot up there.  People were--I mean it didn't turn out the way it was supposed to turn out at all.  People were grabbing spaces for different things and converting spaces and even that big theater that's right next door to the Apollo [Apollo Theater, New York, New York], I can't remember the name of it, but was being used for like a mall.  They used--they gutted it out and it was--and it was such a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) There was one across the street from the Apollo that became--they--they cleaned up all of the people who were selling shea butter and whatever on the street and put them into the African mart [African Market, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yeah, herded them into a little parking lot.  And all--
Speaker 1: So was this when you founded Ballet Tap [Ballet Tap USA]?  That's what--
Speaker 2: After 'Sophisticated Ladies' is when Maurice [HistoryMaker Maurice Hines, Jr.] and I decided that we needed more to--of--of this story themed ba--tap dance to get around.  And we did--we formed Ballet Tap USA.  And ultimately got a producer or Kazuko Hillyer, who was an event producer.  And she put her money behind it and cleaned us up, got us costumes.  She wou- she made a lot of promises, but we were ultimately left to do a lot things for ourselves, getting costumes together.   We ended up not really having a lot of costumes, but--and the repertoire was kind of loose.  We used mo- mas- mainly unitards as costumes.  The thing that we did that was very much costumed was--there were two things, one of them is in this book, a tango piece that I put together and the other thing was 'Pretty and the Wolf' which was Duke Ellington's version of Little Red Riding Hood, and that was very much costumed.  And again, my friend Bernard Johnson put costumes together out of stuff that he had in his stock, as well as creating things.  And he became a part of--a big part of Ballet Tap USA.
Story_ID: 522447
Speaker 1: This you created with Maurice Hines [HistoryMaker Maurice Hines, Jr.].  How long did you keep this going?
Speaker 2: Well, it--it kept up going until the movie 'The Cotton Club.'  And both Gregory [Gregory Hines] and Maurice were hired to do 'The Cotton Club' movie and we in Ballet Tap USA we were going to be doing a tour of Taipei [Taiwan], Hong Kong, Taipei, six cities in Japan.  It was an extensive tour that Kazuko Hillyer made for us.  But instead of coming out on that tour, Maurice did the movie of the Cotton Club [New York, New York] with Gregory.  And the costume designer who was also a fierce choreographer and dancer, he came out and filled in Maurice's spots in the--in the pieces that we did, as a performer.  So he was performing, making costumes.
Speaker 1: So it was too much?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But we did do that tour and we got, it was--it was good, we were accepted very well, but it was much less spectacular then they had thought.  They were--they were expecting, like there's a company in Japan called the Takarazuka [Takarazuka Revue].  And this company is a company--they were here recently and they did a version of 'Chicago' [Fred Ebb and Bob Fosse].  And they dress as men and women.  There are no men in the company, there're only women, and they do all of the parts of anything that they present.  So they have people who are dancing together, male-female, but they're women.  And they--they do incr- I mean it's like a Las Vegas [Nevada] type show with all of the trimmings of a Las Vegas type show and that's what they expected when we went there.  And it was--they were very disappointed.
Speaker 1: How did you handle that?
Speaker 2: Well, we could only fill- fulfill our contract and I didn't take much of the brunt of the situation because I fulfilled our end of the bargain by presenting the dances and the dancers, and we were there and I was dancing and what could I do.  But the--the big thing was the money that was needed to put on a spectacular appearance, which was not forthcoming with what we had.  And we did all of these cities and I--I know that at one point we were--we had a bus that was taking us from one city to the other and we were winding around Mount Fuji, and people called it Fuji-san.  And my friend, who was the costume designer and the dancer and everything, Bernard [Bernard Johnson] was afraid of heights.  So he was lying on the floor of the bus reciting over and over again, "Must Jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free."  And over and over until he calmed himself down, and we were on the way down the mountain.  Because even in the elevators, you know, those Marriott Hotels that have these big elevators that you can see, and he would be plastered up against the wall and the door so he didn't have to look at those--at the heights, because he wa- it was really serious.  And then going to his room, like he was like Spiderman clutching the walls of the--of the inside of the floor until he got to his room.  Must be a terrible thing.
Story_ID: 522448
Speaker 1: I'm assuming it's when you come back in that same year you choreograph 'Blues in the Night'?
Speaker 2: Yes, Sheldon [Sheldon Epps], yeah.  Hooked into Sheldon Epps.
Speaker 1: And this is an off-Broadway piece, correct?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Sheldon--actually Sheldon had it--it was on Broadway very, very briefly, and then it was--he wanted to go--take it out on tour.  And so that's when we--we did some regional companies 'cause I worked, the different people who were in that were incredible.  [HistoryMaker] Eartha Kitt was in one--one company I remember working with a whole--and I meet up with these people now.  I recognize them, I say, "Didn't we work together?" and I don't remember (laughter), I said, "What did we do."  And that's like a common ailment, you know, of--of working with people and you're trying to remember what did I--what did we do together.
Story_ID: 522449
Speaker 1: Tell me about working on 'Juba' [Wendy Lamb].
Speaker 2: Ah 'Juba.'  That was, that was an incredible effort on--also Sheldon Epps contribution because I don't know where--some--some of these people who are directors--Sheldon could be a director and a choreographer.  He and there are some other artistic directors around who went to Carnegie Mellon [Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania].  And I guess Carnegie Mellon must've produced a bunch of geniuses.  That's--that's the only way I can describe it.  There were other people who have--who have theaters, regional theaters who came from Carnegie Mellon and Sheldon knew a lot of these people and had--had either worked with them or gone to school with them.  And he followed that path when he wanted to take 'Juba' out on the road and reproduce it.  Which was a very big deal for me, 'Juba' because it also hooked into the tap dance experience.  Because 'Juba' and the dance, the type of dancing that was produced at that time was related--was the--the godfather of what is now tap dance.  And the tap dance that I'm talking about is the combination of the Irish jigs and reels, and the plantation buckboard dancing where people made noises with their feet and rhythms and certain rhythms.  And it was--it was wonderful because we had--I--I got to do all this research and here--and in New York [New York], I now--down by the courtyard there's I think like a manhole cover that is--designates the spot where Five Points [New York, New York] began, the Five Points district, and that was the stomping grounds of both Wil- William Henry Lane, who was Juba, and John Diamond who was his com- competitor, you know.
Story_ID: 522450
Speaker 1: As you're doing this research, which you obviously enjoyed doing research on it, how did the history of Juba [William Henry Lane] and his role of crossing class and race lines connect with you as you were choreographing the play ['Juba,' Wendy Lamb]?
Speaker 2: Well what he had to go through in being recognized as a--an entity in and of himself, and the background that he com- now he came from Rhode Island and came to New York [New York].  And this other guy, John Diamond, he came from--his father sold him to the circus, so much for family, you know, family and values.  But he had to go out on his own, but the fact was that John Diamond was what they call a dipsomaniac.  He--he liked his drink.  And in those days, I guess medical services and discoveries and treatments were not advanced, and a lot of people used to solve problems by drinking.  And I--I don't know exactly what his ailment was, but most of the time when he was dancing he was drunk.  But I think he had to sober up a little bit when he came to these competitions with Juba that were scheduled.  And the setup was that these competitions took place in an arena that was similar to a boxing match--a boxing area.  And there were three sets of judges.  One set of judges was underneath the stage to determine the accuracy of the sound, another set of judges were on the side of the arena to denote the performers skills as a--connecting with the audience, and the other set underneath sides and then there was out in the audience, another--the third set was trying to scope out how the performers affected the audience and what kind of a, you know, reaction they were getting.  And Juba won the matches that were set up and nobody expected him to do that.  At that time, people of color were not even allowed to carry sticks.  They were not allowed to own dogs.  They were not allowed to--there were so many things, and this is--this is after the Underground Railroad, you know.  Here people are coming up escaping from the South to what, you know.  Being bums or being parts of--they--they--a vagrant life and--and not having any purpose which was, you know, the big deal, at least they had a job when they were slaves.  But now that they don't--there're not slaves anymore so what are we gonna do.  But Juba picked himself up with his winnings, whatever, and went to perform for Queen Victoria.  And he married a white woman, I believe he married the woman before he went to Queen Victoria, went to dance for Queen Victoria, performed for her.  Stayed there for quite a long time and decided to live there.  And as far as I know, that's where he's buried.
Speaker 1: How did you depict, you know, wh- wha- how did that translate into your choreography?
Speaker 2: Well, we fed in parts of what we know today as rhythm, tap--rhythm tap and Irish jigs and reels.  And the Irish jigs and reels were really from what I--I remember from my days at--at the school, at the Our Lady of Lourdes [Our Lady of Lourdes School, New York, New York] and doing St. Patrick's nights and having, you know, a lot of knowledge about the steps that we were--we were taught in the--and retaining that vocabulary.  So, it came--it came back.
Story_ID: 522451
Speaker 1: 'Juba' [Wendy Lamb] was in 1985 [sic.].
Speaker 2: Ah. Um-hm. Okay.
Speaker 1: And then looking a few years forward in 1990, you choreographed 'Tuxedo Junction' [Cheryl Davis] and this was in Birmingham [Alabama], it was there?
Speaker 2: Birmingham, Alabama.
Speaker 1: Yes, can you talk about that production?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  This--this guy who is a real big theater--avid theater fan--fan of the theater, James Hatcher [James F. Hatcher, Jr.] established this theater in Birmingham, Alabama and produced lots of different shows there.  He did--he liked to do musicals, of course, but they al- he also had--liked to do straight plays as well.  And he would hire people from New York [New York] and he liked to bring in people, because he created this community in hopes of making Birmingham a little bit more aware of Broadway and of Broadway of--of the theater in general, making it more of a theater town.  And there were enough people there who were interested in either supporting--supporting it and/or becoming a--I think we're gonna have to--my--my friend is coming in.  He's coming at the door.
Speaker 1: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: So James Hatcher who is the owner of this little theater in Birmingham, Alabama liked to bring people down.  He brought people from Broadway shows.  Of course, he would come up to New York and scout around as to what kinds of shows and what the availability of--of performers was and then bring them down to do specific shows that he had chosen.  He'd done things like 'Dames at Sea' [George Haimsohn and Robin Miller].  Small shows--smallish kinds of shows so that he didn't ne- need a large cast.  But he would venture out and try to enlarge the presentations.  The theater wasn't that big but still it's quite amazing what you can do on a small stage (laughter).  So, I got used to wor- working on small stages, which again I came up with when--when we did that presentation at the York Theatre [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And this show, 'Tuxedo Junction,' what is it about?
Speaker 2: It's about the--the man who wrote the song.  It's following that--that path of--of his musical path.  And also the history of--I'm not sure whether I--Or--it's not Ornette Coleman, I'm trying to remember the name of the composer of the song 'Tuxedo Junction.'  But it was Div--
Speaker 1: Was it Erskine Hawkins?
Speaker 2: Ersk- Erskine Hawkins, yes.  Erskine Hawkins.
Story_ID: 522452
Speaker 1: Did you know when you were doing this the--his [Erskine Hawkins] relationship to your [paternal] grandfather [Duke Ellington]?
Speaker 2: Not really.  Because I, I find a lot of history along the way and coincidently, which is why I say, you know, the Ellington band [Duke Ellington Orchestra] toured and then I feel sometimes like I'm following in their footsteps.  And like the time when I saw that--the sign up there in Saskatchewan [Canada].  And it's--it boggles my mind somehow that they could be traveling so much all the time to so many different places.  Many people come up to me now and say, "Oh when I was in college I saw--."  They would play colleges.  There was nothing too big or too small for him to play.  He didn't--as long as they were playing, that was fine, you know.  And I think that that's the lesson that a lot of people had learned and especially also eventually my father [Mercer Ellington], that as long as the band kept on playing it didn't matter where they were, whether it was colleges or whether it was backyards or you know, barbeque parties, they would play.
Speaker 1: And have you had that philosophy as well about your work?
Speaker 2: I, yeah, because I think that I like to--I like to think up of weird combinations of things.  I'd like to think of combining different types of--of formulas of entertaining.  For instance, when we just recently--when we did a presentation or when I take out our band, when I--when we do the Duke Ellington Center Big Band, I like to make it a combination of a jazz concert and a Broadway revue.  So people just, they--they say okay here's--this is a jazz band that coming, but they're gonna also get dancing, they're gonna get singing, and they're gonna get some text, gonna be some reading of some of the words of Duke Ellington, maybe, you know, some of the poems, some of his sayings.  It could be just a combination of things.  And I--and a lot of people are doing this.  It's like--it's like what Cirque du Soleil has--has tried to do.  They've combined a lot of different things into this one presentation that they do that, you know, you never know what you're gonna see next, you never know what's gonna happen.  If it's gonna be a scene from a play or if it's gonna be a dance or an acrobatic thing or some painting or whatever, you know.

Speaker 1: I wanna turn to you in the--this full career that you have created for yourself as a dancer and choreographer, where--has there been time for love?
Speaker 2: Every once in a while, yeah, I--I make space for love, yes.  I think that it serves you to or me, especially with my background of such jiggling back and forth and not having a what so called normal family life.  I have had partners and right now I'm in between.  I--I guess you--I'm--I'm not looking for anything right now.  I think if you look for something it never happens.  I--I'm trying to concentrate on building this, not a career, but building this estab- I'm on a journey to establish Duke Ellington as an entity that nobody will forget.  And to make sure that his legacy is in good standing and in--in good hands so that after me, people can get--I mean--I'm--I'm one of the last horses, you know.  So then when you think of the people who have actually lived through the Duke Ellington experience itself, I feel responsible for passing it on in--intact.
Story_ID: 522454
Speaker 1: Do you feel somewhat at odds with your brother who is so-called in charge?
Speaker 2: Well, somewhat.  I feel that we're working different purposes because we each have different understandings of what it is that--it--that is the Ellington heritage, especially because my brother Paul [Paul Ellington] was not alive during Duke Ellington's time.  He was no--not in direct contact with him.  He has probably seen some tapes and things like that, but he hasn't had the experience.  I mean I went to Russia with the band [Duke Ellington Orchestra], you know.  It was like--and I saw the people and their reactions first hand of how they intertwined with--with him as a person and as a musician.  I'm also a musician of sorts, I mean in--in the field I was in this entertainment business regardless.  So I'm--I think I have a leg up on that understanding.  And I have a certain rapport with the musicians.  They--they've always referred to me as oh here--here comes that Ellington kid.  And--and or the dancer, Ellington the dancer, they refer to me as that, even now.
Speaker 1: And is there any relationship between you and Paul?
Speaker 2: Well not currently because for some reason--well he doesn't live here.  I'm never where he's at.  Now there's gonna be--I'm--I heard the Duke Ellington band is gonna be at the Blue Note [Blue Note Jazz Club, New York, New York] in September.  So, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, so I'm gonna go.  And--and I hope that he's there, and I could say hello.
Story_ID: 522455
Speaker 1: Back to you.  There was a--there was an article in The New York Times in 1992 that announced your engagement--
Speaker 2: Oh yes.
Speaker 1: --to an Eric Butler?
Speaker 2: Eric Butler, yes.
Speaker 1: But I don't think you married Eric Butler?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Can you tell that story?
Speaker 2: He lives on the West Coast, I live on the East Coast.  And I have a philosophy about things and people on the West Coast and he actually was born in New Jersey, but we could not match up our lives.  He's a musician and he's a performer as well.  He used to sing with [HistoryMaker] Marilyn McCoo and Billy [HistoryMaker Billy Davis, Jr.]--and now he's mostly arranging I think and teaching.  I'm not sure what his--his career is.  But the way people, I don't--manage themselves out.  Maybe it's the lack of discipline.  You see, I'm--I always go back to that point of being a precision dancer and maybe I'm too hands on and maybe I'm too demanding as far as being specific, but he's not specific, he goes for anything, he'll--he's a free soul.  And so him being a free soul and me being a precision dancer (laughter) didn't quite match and so after a while it just.  I--I was, you know, I even thought about moving out there and then I said, what are you crazy.  And so I decided that this was--we both decided that this was not gonna work.  And we're friends, still friends.
Story_ID: 522456
Speaker 1: Do you think that you will get married?
Speaker 2: At this point, I don't--and at this age, not age, but at this age of our universe, there's no point to getting married.  There's--unless you--I thi- and I think that marriage should be a business transaction.  And the way people are thinking about things now and the contract that you make when you get married should be more along the lines of a business contract.  People get into so much trouble and the original reason for being together just goes out the window.  So I think that unfortunately it has to separate itself like that, otherwise if you have, you know, feelings towards a person and you wanna be with them, it's fine you can be with them and as far as you know or want to and with no holds.  I feel independent, I have my own apartment, you know, in New York [New York], what else can I say.  I mean this--I'm fortunate to have this apartment.  I--I realize that and I--it's the backbone of my independence.
Story_ID: 522457
Speaker 1: You have committed a big part of your time and effort to the legacy of your [paternal] grandfather and that includes establishing--tell me what you have established in his name?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, to the end of having things go on after me without me, whatever, I've established the Duke Ellington Center for the Arts [New York, New York].  Hopefully, this will be an--an entity that would be carried on by other people and so they--they pick up the gauntlet and they carry it on so that generations will come to know Ellington, will know about his life and times and music, especially music.  And that there'll be somebody who had the knowledge to do that, somebody who has the knowledge, who'll have the wherewithal and the wherewithal meaning the lack of an individual--a lot of people have their own agendas and if they can just give up the agenda and look to the purpose of this one thing, I mean for the purpose of--of--I--I hate to u- I really hesitate to use the word preserve, but because jazz cannot be preserved.  Jazz is moving all the time and it's a--it's difficult to--to explain.  But when I see--when I see people like Wynton [Wynton Marsalis], I can take heart in the fact that things are going to be taken care of.  I would like for, you know, he does his own thing and he has many, many people to take care of and I feel like--I feel as if we--I'm trying to take care of Ellington [Duke Ellington] as much as I can.  He took care of me, now it's my turn to take care of him.
Story_ID: 522458
Speaker 1: And it's interesting because your father [Mercer Ellington], at least early in his life, it seems like he tried to establish his own identity separate from--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --his father [Duke Ellington] and it didn't work?
Speaker 2: No, and--and my grandfather, himself, said it, although it might have been selfish at the time because maybe there would've been a chance for my father to have a little band somewhere or a little combo, but he said there's only one Ellington at a time in that field.  God forbid if I was a man, I don't know what would've happened.  Probably wouldn't have done anything.  I don't know if I would've been allowed to do anything, un- except for being in the family business.
Story_ID: 522459
Speaker 1: And what about your half-siblings, would it--?
Speaker 2: Well, my half-sibling Gaye [Gaye Ellington], she is a--a very, very gifted artist and right now she's devoted to caring for her mother.  The main caregiver for her mother, but she is an incredible artist.  And my--which Ellington also was an artist, he--he painted.  My brother, sometimes he plays with the band, he plays guitar.
Speaker 1: And what's his name?
Speaker 2: Edward [Edward Ellington II].  Edward.  And he's involved in his own projects of--a lot of them are musical, but I don't really get to talk to them that much and it's been kind of a rift and a misunderstanding.  I think it's misunderstandings.  You know like space can--space and time not used can create all kinds of bad feelings.  Like if I don't call them or who called you, did you call me or did I call you, or who was the last person to call, stuff builds up like that that really doesn't make any sense at all in the scheme of things, you know.  There's no excuse.  But I--I've been very busy and I--I blame myself because I have taken care of a lot of other people and sometimes my family comes last and I don't--because I'm not used to having a family, no.  My--now my other sisters on my mother's [Ruth Silas Batts] side, they are kind of the same way, although they're each like brains, brainiacs.  They're in the top of their fields, whatever they choose and I feel kind of closer to them then I--then I do with my--
Speaker 1: And tell me who--who are they?
Speaker 2: Those are my--my sister--the twins, they're twins, Debbie [HistoryMaker Deborah A. Batts] and Diane Batts [Diane Batts Morrow].  Debbie is a judge, a federal judge.  Diane, her twin sister, is a professor of ethnic history at the University of Georgia in Athens [Georgia].  And my sister Denise [Denise Batts], the youngest one of my mom's siblings, she is a computer nut.
Speaker 1: And so do you all get together at all for family events, do you connect?
Speaker 2: Usually holidays, especially Christmas.
Speaker 1: Where do you do that?
Speaker 2: At Christmas I go to my mom's sister's--she has an apartment on 106th [Street, New York, New York], a large apartment and she gets a large tree.  So she has like a trim the tree party.  And also Thanksgiving she usually has Thanksgiving at her place 'cause there're a lot of people.  She has--she has this--she has a disease called inviting people to her house.  And--I mean it's a big enough house--apartment for her to do this, but then she gets justices, all kinds--which is how I met Soto- Soto- Sotomayor [Sonia Sotomayor], I'm stuttering now.  And--and some of the other people.  And I--I kind of am in awe of those kinds of brains, you know, of how those brains work.  I hear lawyers talking together or judges talking together and I'm like, how do they do this.  How do they retain all this knowledge, what'd they, you know.  I tried to convert them at a very young age into the world of ballet, but that was not working at all.
Story_ID: 522460
Speaker 1: When you think about your life and all the things that you've been able to do, what--what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: She survived (laughter).  Yeah, she survived. It's--I went through some close scrapes and it was--it's the feeling that I cannot forget.  You can never forget the--that when your very existence is--is in question.  And I mean a lot of people don't understand why I had to do those things or why I had to experience this.  Perhaps it's my--my way of being independent and not relying.  And this comes, I think, from my grandmother, my mother's mother [Louise Petgrave Silas] being a very stubborn and independent woman from Kingston, Jamaica, who achieved a lot in her time and was able to leap over tall buildings, you know.  Because now we have, and you know, I'm up against another thing, ageism now.  I'm facing this time when people just think well, it's all over for her and no more opp- which is why I'm creating them.  If nobody's gonna hire me, nobody's knocking on my door, I'll make it up.
Story_ID: 522461
Speaker 1: Well, and you've created a beautiful book about your [paternal] grandfather?
Speaker 2: Ah, yes.
Speaker 1: What was the impetus for doing that?
Speaker 2: Well, Phoebe Jacobs was the impetus for doing this book ['Duke Ellington: An American Composer and Icon,' Mercedes Ellington and Steven Brower].  Because she had done a book with Armstrong's, with Louis Armstrong's picture book ['Satchmo: The Wonderful World and Art of Louis Armstrong,' Steven Brower].  And Steven Brower was the same person who did that book, totally a picture book, coffee table book.  And it consisted of all of Louis Armstrong's--not all of, but a lot of his picture collection.  And she convinced me that I should do the same thing with Ellington [Duke Ellington] and she provided me with a lot of pictures that she had and that she took.
Speaker 1: And who is she in relation?
Speaker 2: And Phoebe Jacobs was a self-appointed manager of the Duke Ellington band [Duke Ellington Orchestra] and--of when it was with my grandfather and also with my father [Mercer Ellington].  She was the daughter of a--of a nightclub owner and a hatcheck girl, and had relations with--in her--in her father's venue she came up against--not up a--up against, but she was working for people like Sarah Vaughan, and Peggy Lee, and lots of vocalists.  And she was a very important person in establishing another entity that has kind of gone by the wayside called Society of Singers, which Cy Coleman's wife, Lillian [sic. Shelby Coleman] was a part of that as well.  And I met a lot of singers.
Speaker 1: And so she--she told you about the--how she created the Louis Armstrong book and suggested that you do a book?
Speaker 2: The same thing, yes.  And because the same person who co-authored this, Steven Brower, with me did the Louis Armstrong book, he knew exactly what it should--how it should happen.  And the fact that Rizzoli was interested was a big plus.
Speaker 1: And so this is a 2016 publication?
Speaker 2: Yes, March 22nd.
Speaker 1: How many pictures are in the book?
Speaker 2: I don't know, I haven't--haven't really counted and I don't know how many they left out or they didn't put in.
Speaker 1: What do you hope people will receive from the book?
Speaker 2: I hope they'll get a picture of the expanse and the different details of my life as it relates to both the dance world and the jazz world, the music world.  How you can juggle all those things and just put them all in the same recipe and come up with a pie or a cake.
Story_ID: 522462
Speaker 1: When you think about your many experiences, is there anything that you would do differently if you could do it again?
Speaker 2: Oh sure, yeah.  There're decisions that I would've ma- that I have made--I had made that I probably would've made another choice.  But of course, when you make decisions you use the material that's available to you for making those and of course, after the fact, you know, then you say oh why did I do that, you know, I could've done this.  But like I would never have changed the fact that I wanted to be a dancer.  As far as coming back from--from--this is a turn around that--that could've happened.  When I finished the--Gleason [Jackie Gleason] decided not to resume his shows and so the Gleason show ['The Jackie Gleason Show'] went off the air, I came back up north and I was offered a couple of different things.  I was offered the jobs 'No, No, Nanette,' [Otto Harbach and Frank Mandel].  I was offered another job in another show Talley Beatty was choreographing, and I was offered a place in Alvin Ailey company [Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater].  And so I had to make a decision and oh, and 'George M!' [Francine Pascal, John Pascal, and Michael Stewart].  I did a thing called 'George M!' with Joel Grey on television.  That, so I did two things, I did 'No, No, Nanette' and the Joel Grey thing.  And them the other two, I didn't do.  As it turns out the Talley Beatty project fell by the wayside, it didn't last very long.  And so I guess I was--that was a good choice.
Story_ID: 522463
Speaker 1: When you talk to young people who might want to go into dance today, what advice would you give to them?
Speaker 2: First I'd--I--I try to ask them who's--who are--who's supporting them, not financially necessarily, but who's helping them make decisions and who is, who's their posse, who's with them, their support systems.  And then I--I ask them to make sure that that's exactly what they want or if they can insert something a little different, skew it a certain way to personalize it so that it's unique.  And I encourage them to be unique in their selection of whatever th- whatever it is that they do.  Because there're a lot of people doing the same thing, you know, and that's just what you need, another person doing the same thing.
Speaker 1: Do you think in this economic environment that it's wise for one to walk that path?
Speaker 2: Well you know, you--you only have a certain time on this earth, so if you wanna do whatever you wanna do, you gotta do it and as far as we know that's it (laughter).  So, unless you're planning seriously on coming back, you know, I would say do what you have to do now.
Story_ID: 522464
Speaker 1: Okay, I think this is my Confirmation.  I was trying to decide whether it was my Holy Communion or my Confirmation, but I believe it's my Confirmation.
Speaker 2: And you're about how old?
Speaker 1: That's older, so was it ten, something.  First Communion is first (laughter), Confirmation is second.  And I'm a lapsed Catholic, so.  All the dust that's over there, God.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is a group of my mom's club called the Noiserelles.  And they were a ballroom dance group and they performed their exhibition dancers--dances in between the sets of ballroom events of their parents.  So all their parents went and did ball--went to ballroom events, and at the intermission, they put on an exhibition.
Speaker 2: And where's your mother?
Speaker 1: Right there, there she is.

Speaker 2: And this is a picture of my father and a portrait of Duke Ellington, I don't know who it's by and then me, and I believe this is in my great aunt's--my Great Aunt Ruth's [Ruth Ellington Boatwright] apartment.

Speaker 1: And this is me.  One, two three, four, fourth from the end.
Speaker 2: And this is in the dressing room of the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre [New York, New York] where we were doing 'Sophisticated Ladies.'
Speaker 1: And that was in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen eighty [1980], '81 [1981].
Speaker 1: And this was for a show--a photo shoot for, was it Glamour or one of those magazines, and we all had our--our finale costumes on from 'Sophisticated Ladies.'
Speaker 2: Another shot from 'Sophisticated Ladies.'  It's from a number that we did call "Dancers in Love."  And that's Gregg Burge, I'm in the middle and Hinton Battle on the other side.
Speaker 1: That's himself.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is a shot of June Taylor's sister [Marilyn Gleason], Jackie Gleason's daughter, and another person, I don't know who this woman is, but this is me and this is when during the Florida--I think they--this is in New York [New York].  They came up, we had a reunion and they liked to go to Patsy's Restaurant [Patsy's Italian Restaurant, New York, New York].  Patsy's was a famous restaurant.
Speaker 1: This is a scene from 'Pretty and the Wolf' which is a piece that was put together by--by myself and Maurice Hines [HistoryMaker Maurice Hines, Jr.] for DancEllington.
Speaker 2: (OFF CAMERA VOICE):  Are you in that?
Speaker 1: Yes.  This is me on the floor.
Speaker 2: And this is a program from--that we did called 'Crackerjazz, Peter and the Duke.'  It featured the piece that was just before that, which is the jazz version of Little Red Riding Hood.
Speaker 1: And DancEllington grew out of?
Speaker 2: Ballet Tap USA (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: And that's just a headshot, an early headshot.
