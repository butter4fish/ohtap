Speaker 1: I ask five questions of everyone; they're a little People magazine-ish but bear with me--short answers.  I'd like to know what your favorite food is.
Speaker 2: My favorite food, strangely enough, is--for lunch--is peanut butter and jelly, but I like franks and beans.
Speaker 1: (Laughter).  That was--almost sounds like someone who's been in elementary school. I'm sorry (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--That's right; my grandmother used to fix that every day for lunch and I loved it.
Speaker 1: Your favorite time of year?
Speaker 2: Favorite time of the year is actually this time of the year when I get an opportunity to come up here to Martha's Vineyard [Massachusetts].
Speaker 1: So that's the summer.
Speaker 2: That's the summer, yes.  But now, almost all year because we're living down in Sarasota, Florida.
Speaker 1: Favorite color?
Speaker 2: I'd say green.
Speaker 1: Favorite place to vacation?
Speaker 2: Martha's Vineyard; I don't know why I would say that, but it's Martha's Vineyard.
Speaker 1: And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: I don't really have a favorite saying that I know of.  No, I can't really say; there's so many different things that come to my--to my mind but I don't--it's a short question--supposed to be.
Speaker 1: (Laughter) No problem.
Story_ID: 179655
Speaker 1: Anyway, I want to take you--I want to first ask you about your mother, and I know that she died when you were very young.  Do you have any memory of her?
Speaker 2: I really have no recollection of her at all, other than the pictures that I've seen.  I know that she is very beautiful and I have a picture up there which you might be able to see a little later.
Speaker 1: Can you give me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I was two and a-half years when I--when (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Can you give--give me her, her name?
Speaker 2: Her name was Bertha--her maiden name was Ramsome--Bertha McMurren.
Speaker 1: And where was--do you know where she was from originally?
Speaker 2: Yeah, she was from Plymouth, North Carolina; my father was from Elizabeth City, North Carolina which are very close to one another.
Speaker 1: And can you--did you have much contact with her side of the family at all growing up?
Speaker 2: Yes, basically; a number of cousins were the Ramsome's.  Frank Ramsome was my cousin, he stayed in close contact; especially he was an insurance agent so he insured every member of my family (laughter).
Story_ID: 179656
Speaker 1: Okay, and your father--can you give his name?
Speaker 2: His name was Noah, N-O-A-H, like Noah's Ark, Noah; the middle name was the same as mine, Edison, McMurren.
Speaker 1: Now, what do you know about his growing up?  Did he--was he a talker?  Did he talk to you much about--
Speaker 2: Well, he's got a--he had a very interesting story to an extent because while he was in World War I [WWI], came outta World War I, he wanted to become a physician or a dentist, and at the time he really didn't have enough--he, he was accepted but he didn't have enough money to go on.  He went to Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina] and graduated, but he didn't have the money to go on; and some of his friends, when he told me later, who would become dentists and, and physicians, told me that he, my father, was one of the smartest persons in the class, especially in science; but at any rate, he wasn't able to go.  And then he ended up, as so many of those who went to World War I and were well-educated when they came out, they found very few jobs or opportunities, so he went into the post office, as so many people did.  So--and he worked at night most all of my life, and so many times there was very little contact that I had because during the day I was either in school or otherwise occupied.
Speaker 1: Now--what do you know about his, his family, like his father and, you know, the family?
Speaker 2: I knew of his, his father; only that he loved to drink hot tea, which was just water--hot water, as tea.  And I know he was missing a thumb.  I remember I can recollect seeing him having one thumb missing, but I can't remember more than that; that was down in Elizabeth City [North Carolina] because shortly after my mother died, my father had me to be raised with my aunts--two aunts there--one was older than the other; both were school teachers.  And I gained a lot from that experience there, so I was down there until I went back up to New York [New York] 'cause I was born in Harlem Hospital [Center, New York, New York].  I went back up to New York and I lived with my great-aunt [Priscilla Manly] and were about a house full of kids, but I was there with a number of cousins, so I had very little contact with my father or with anyone else in the regular family until my father re-married.  And when I was about eight and I came to live with him and my stepmother [Fannie McMurren].
Speaker 1: Now, I wanna just ask another question about your father and do you know what year he graduated from Shaw, and did he--do you know?  Would it been in the teens?  You said he--
Speaker 2: Let's see--1918, '20 [1920]; hmm, hmm, I should know that; that's gonna be part of--my granddaughter has asked me to do a genealogy on the entire family and I think that's included but I haven't gotten to that yet, but it probably would have been about maybe 1924, '25 [1925].
Story_ID: 179657
Speaker 1: And did he [McMurren's father, Noah Edison McMurren] share any stories with you about growing up at all?  You know, I know that he wanted to become a--you know, a doctor and couldn't, you know, couldn't afford it, but was--but his growing up in Elizabeth City [North Carolina] did he share any, anything, any--
Speaker 2: Nothing of any real great significance that I can remember other than they, you know, had some tough times and rough times at the time; so nothing other than that.  And he told--used to tell me about my mother [Bertha Ramsome McMurren] and how she--he had--she had told him to make--make sure he kept--he took good care of me.
Speaker 1: Now, do you know how he--why he came to New York [New York]?
Speaker 2: I--it may have been the opportunities, possibly, in the post office and other job possibilities; that's the only reason I would think he would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: How would you describe him?  What type of man was he?
Speaker 2: He was pretty stern, pretty strict, and I could be sure that I would be disciplined if I went astray.  I remember one incident he told me about a--well, I, I learned really--I had an idol when I was growing up; I was about twelve I guess--ten, ten years old, and I always hang--hung out with persons who were older than myself, and it was one fellow there and he was my idol and he smoked.  So I said, "Boy, it be just great to be smokin', especially with a pipe."  And so I started smokin' a little bit too; I grabbed a couple cigarettes, and one very smart thing I did was to bring a cigarette into the house and go into the bathroom and decide that I was gonna smoke in there and nobody would know.  My father didn't smoke--he didn't smoke, my stepmother [Fannie McMurren] didn't smoke, and I thought surely that nobody could discern my smoking in the bathroom--the door was closed.  And when he came to the door, he said, "Lionel," he says, "Are you smoking?"  And I had to tell him, "Yes, Dad."  And I told him the story.  He said, "Come into your room."  I said, "Oh, boy, now I'm gonna really get it," you know?  So I came into the room and I thought he was gonna--wow!--hit me or whatever, and he sat me down and he said, "You know, I would prefer that you not"--he says, "Smokin' is not good; I don't smoke and it's not good for your health, and I would prefer you not to smoke until you're at least twenty-one."  And I said, "Well, like, is that all?  Is that the end of it?"  That was such a major shock treatment for me that I, I never did smoke until--I never did smoke until years later when I was in Snookie's Sugar Bowl, and the people said, "Lionel, you ever smoke?"  I said, "No, I gave up smokin' when I was twelve years old," and I told 'em the story, you know?  He say, "I don't believe that," so I said, "I'll bet you a malted milk that I can smoke," and so I inhaled; I took a cigarette, and for the first and the last time I took a cigarette, inhaled, and I smoked for a little while, and then I blew smoke rings out and I said, "See?  You know I can smoke."  But that was it, and then I got the malted milk.
Speaker 1: Now, with--your fath--one other question I have is the name, McMurren; do you know the origin of the name?
Speaker 2: People have asked about the origin of McMurren, and that was--I'm going to go on the internet to try to trace it; that was--that's one of my projects at this time.  We were talkin' about that the other day.  I always tell people whenever they see the name McMurren, either it's a relative of mine or somebody that surely I would have to trace to that origin because most times the people will say McMurray with R-A, R-A-Y, or McMurrin, I-N, but I don't know of many McMurren's, and you look in the telephone book, you won't see many McMurren's.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I don't really know other than--in fact it's M-C, so it's Irish, rather than M-A-C, which would be Scottish; but that's as far as I can go with that.
Story_ID: 179658
Speaker 1: Now, what is your earliest memory of growing up?  It would be in Elizabeth City [North Carolina], right?  Because that was where you--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my earliest recollection growing up where I was in Elizabeth City with my aunts, and they would--I would go to school with them, as I was just, I guess, about three years old or so, they were teachers and I would go to school.  I learned a lot from them.  And when I came up to live with my great-aunt [Priscilla Manly], I remember there was quite a number of cousins in the house, and we lived on about the fifth floor; we were on--we were at 120--119 West 129th Street [New York, New York]; I remember the exact address.  And I remember my little--smaller--my smaller cousin and myself, we would go around--it was about 1933; we would go around to the various stores and ask for a day-old bread, or anything 'cause--and we'd do all--whatever we would say is that--we'd know that things are--times are really hard because the [Great] Depression was on.  I remember those earlier days, and that's basically it until I went to live with my father and my stepmother [Fannie McMurren].
Speaker 1: What did your--what things did your aunts teach you that--you said they taught you, you know, several things, and I'm wondering what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Basically, manners and respect--respect for elders and respect for the people that you're with, and taught me that to love is one of the greatest attributes you could have in your possession, and to be able to give--give love, and--and expect it in return but know that it's not owed to you.  But that's one of the things that she taught me--and discipline, basically.
Speaker 1: So they--really, they were your--like parents--
Speaker 2: They were (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: I mean you didn't like know any difference at that point (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: That's true, yes.
Speaker 1: Now, were you--you said they took you to school.  Do you remember observations about, you know, being in the classroom?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember any of that, other than just being there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 179659
Speaker 1: And you were what age when you went to New York [New York]--or when she took you?  It was one aunt, right--that went?
Speaker 2: Yes, in Elizabeth City [North Carolina] and they were teachers.  I guess I must have been around--right after my mother [Bertha Ramsome McMurren] died, so it must have been when I was two and a-half--two and a-half or three years of age, that's when I went to live with them; and probably up until the time I was maybe about six, and then I went to live with my great-aunt, and she was in Harlem [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Do you remember actually arriving to Harlem with your--you know, to be with your great-aunt?  Do you remem--or did she come pick you up and take you there, or do you know?
Speaker 2: I don't know; I imagine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: They brought you from (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sure that my father [Noah Edison McMurren] escorted me there to the house.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this--your aunt--great-aunt was--her name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Priscilla Manley [ph.].
Speaker 1: And do you know--do you remember where you were living?
Speaker 2: Yeah, 120--119 West 129th Street [New York, New York], on the fifth floor (laughter), with about fifteen people in the--looks like--I think 15 people in that one basic apartment.
Speaker 1: So that was a time when the apartments were being cut up--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, and--into lots of--in Chicago they called them kitchenettes; I don't know what they called them in, in New York.
Speaker 2: I know I was basically sleeping with my older cousin; his name was Fred Manley [ph.], and here's a little tragic story.  He was a--I think he was a near genius.  He was a--he invented a crystal radio before I knew of crystal radios being available, and he taught me how to swim.  He was just--he knew something about everything.  One of the tragic things is that when he entered the service, which I have in my autobiography that I'm trying to write--when he went into the service, he discovered--when he had to enlist, he discovered that his name was not Fred Manley; my aunt's--great-aunt's name was Priscilla Manley and his name was--they said his name was Fred Rhodes [ph.].  And so he learned that Priscilla--Aunt Priscilla was not his mother; she raised him but--as a child--as her child, and that was such a shock to him and he never was the same.  I think he went out of his mind almost, you know, trying to find out well, who is his mother and what, what happened, and all of that.  It just was just a--emotional shock to him; he never was the same after that--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and he died early--an early age.
Speaker 1: Now, how old was he when you--you know, you said, you know, he was your roommate.  How old were you and how old was he?
Speaker 2: I was, I was probably about six, seven--six, and he was probably about nine or ten--eleven.  No, I think maybe eleven or twelve.
Speaker 1: So he was like a big brother.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 179660
Speaker 1: I want you to sort of take yourself back to that, you know, to that.  Was it a brownstone or was a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah a walk-up, you had to walk up--it was a walk-up first of all, and you had to walk up about ten steps to get to the first floor (laughter), and then we had to walk up five flights to get to the fifth floor, you know?  So I remember years ago we used to call and ask for the ice man.  'Cause like you call and you say, "I want a fifteen cent piece."  And he'd cut it out and you'd have to take--walk it all the way up to the fifth floor, but I remember that.  And I remember a very tragic thing that happened; one of the roomers there apparently had some kind of altercation with his wife.  He was living there, and she called up to him and he saw she was downstairs, so he rushed downstairs and I understand that she had some people waiting for him, and they did away with him--stabbed him.  So that was a traumatic experience for me 'cause I could see it from a distance, you know.  But outside (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: You could see the incident from a distance (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I could see, yes.  But they were gangin' on him and I saw them stabbin' him.  But other than that, most of the experiences were good and positive.
Speaker 1: Now, that's what I want.  I would like to take you back there and I wanna ask you what sights, smells, and/or sounds--or sounds remind you of your childhood, you know, growing up there?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Well, the sound of busy streets and busy people on the streets because, as I grew up in Harlem [New York, New York], Harlem was my home and I came to--I went to school, naturally, in Harlem, and a lot of things were acceptable, and I know what--began to know what to avoid, what not to participate in, and the sounds and--it was the sounds of--normal sounds to me.  I imagine it might be disturbing to a lot of other people (laughter) hearing different sounds and yells and screams, and things goin' on but, you know, you screen those kinda things out and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Sounds of people? (Simultaneous)
Speaker 2: People and things and traffic and all kinds of things goin' on at the same time; and street vendors and whatever was goin' on because you knew what was happening basically, you could see what to avoid and what not to, and you--let's call it street smarts; we came up--came to become street smart and know how to survive, I should say.  And there were a lot of positive things, however, around--as far as people were concerned, especially when I started school--very positive things.  And with the kinds of experiences I, I really was having, I'd say at home, and generally the school and the various teachers I had, and the church, which my stepmother [Fannie McMurren] directed me to, were my salvation at that time because of the people there.
Speaker 1: I wanna go back to--any smells?
Speaker 2: Stifling smell of smoke, generally.  I could always feel that that was either coming from the chimneys or coming from the pipes and the cigarettes, and I still--I don't smoke and I don't have a high tolerance for it--to being around persons who are smoking regularly.  Matter of fact, I had so many of my friends who were smokers and chain-smokers and, and I, I didn't shun them but I would always be--not--well, I was not a pain in the neck with them but what I would do is try to admonish them and say that "You gotta stop smokin'."  And some of the people did not heed me and heed my plea, and they're not here any longer because they have died of lung cancer.  At least three of my close friends were in that stage.
Story_ID: 179661
Speaker 1: So there's a lot of activity occurring, you know, on the streets and, and, you know, it's, it's what the aliveness of really Harlem [New York, New York] in many ways.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And we're--we're in like 19--the early 19--right after the depress--well, the [Great] Depression--you're right in the Depression (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: The '30s [1930s].
Speaker 1: Right, you're in the [Great] Depression.  And so what--and you're living with your great-aunt [Priscilla Manley], you have cousins around you, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What--who on the block--who is--are you aware of the block, or it's mainly the building?
Speaker 2: Mainly the building.  I don't remember many oppor--many times when I was out in the street playing, and so most of my contacts were with my cousins within the building, and I don't remember--I don't--maybe I was only there maybe one or two years at the most.
Speaker 1: And then your father [Noah Edison McMurren] got married.
Speaker 2: Yes.  I must have been about seven and--because I think I went with my father and he got married in 1933, so I think I was eight years old then, and that's when I went to live with him.
Story_ID: 179662
Speaker 1: Can you give the name of the school you attended?
Speaker 2: Well, the first school I remember attending was Public School Five [P.S. 5, Alexander Webb School, Harlem, New York, New York], and I was living at 580 Saint Nicholas Avenue [New York, New York]; on the other side was Edgecomb Avenue, and the other side was Saint Nicholas.  And the school was right across the street, diagonally across the street, on Edgecomb Avenue.  And that was the first school I went to, and I think I was placed initially in the third grade.  They felt that--they saw whatever assessment they made, that I didn't belong in the third grade, and they put me in the fifth grade.  And so I found myself in the fifth grade, I remember, and then shortly after that in the sixth grade.  And my recollection and story begins at that point in time because I even remember my teacher's name--Mr. Amatrano, and he was a sixth grade and he taught us a song, 6-8-1.  It was Alexander Webb School [P.S. 5, Harlem, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: But what I'm curious about--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --How were you able--is this sort of natural talent, or were you reading--was this influence of, you know, other people--'cause you weren't playing out on the streets, so that meant that, you know, you were sort of keeping close tabs--someone was keeping close tabs on you.
Speaker 2: Yes, sure.
Speaker 1: So I'm just wondering up to that--you know, we can get to sixth grade, but up to that--you know, up to even, you know you going to third grade and they putting you to fifth grade; what was going--why that?
Speaker 2: I don't know why; maybe it was because--I, I felt I knew a lot, and most things that I was exposed to I adjusted to very well and learned quickly.  I, I thought I read a lot at the time.
Speaker 1: What were you reading?
Speaker 2: Well, interestingly enough, and I don't know exactly the year, but I had a friend, Mrs.--what's her name?  Almost got--she would come--every time she came to visit us, she would bring a book, and it was a book about dogs; I came to love dogs; it's a book called 'A Critter and Other Dogs' [by, Albert Payson Terhune], and Ole' Faithful and--not the geyser, but faithful as far as a dog, but I loved--became to love dogs.  And I, I learned a lot just from reading about dogs but--so, I think--and I was in 6A-1 which is a one class, the top class in the sixth grade, and when I went to [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York], which is a school which I have most fond memories of, I was placed in what is called a rapid advance class.  So, junior high school was three years, and so I went three years and two years as a result goin' through high school; I got out when I was sixteen years old.
Speaker 1: So you're saying that besides the fact of just reading and liking books about dogs, I'm just wondering what other things were sort of forming you, or maybe just being a quick study.  Were you--were you in school before third grade?
Speaker 2: Only with my aunt--just traveling with her.
Speaker 1: So she's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: And she taught me a lot on the side, and I learned--I had a lotta interaction, I'll say, with my cousins and all, and they're all talkin' about different things, and I got involved in speaking, interacting, and I think I learned a lot and picked up a lot of things from just that.  I was always interested in whatever was going on, and found myself asking questions about whatever it was, and discussing it, you know, with whomever.  So that may have contributed to my, at least, a perception of other people that I was maybe smart or at least I had a greater potential than, than ordinary, so they skipped me a grade.  I know I was skipped in the third grade to the fifth grade; they put me in the third and I was skipped to the fifth, and the next thing I remember I was in the sixth grade, and that's where I remember all of my formal studying begin.
Story_ID: 179663
Speaker 1: Can you describe what you were like as a, as a young boy?  I mean were you quiet?  Were you--I don't think you were mischievous but I--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: Were you a typical boy, or were you sort of introspective--you sort of lived inside yourself?  Were you rambunctious?
Speaker 2: That's an interesting question.  I don't ever remember being totally introspective; basically, I was always outgoing.  I didn't do--I wasn't like--well, I didn't--exerting myself or I didn't exert myself to the great extent to be the center of attraction; that was never my aim, but I was always responsive to whomever it was, and taking part in whatever it was that was going on, so I, I gained from that.  I felt it was always something to gain from just being involved with, with whatever is going on, as long as it wasn't something I can foresee as a negative influence.
Story_ID: 179664
Speaker 1: Did you wanna be anything, you know--young--and I'm talking about--I mean what did you think you wanted to be?  Did you have an idea?
Speaker 2: Yeah, basically, I wanted to be--initially, when I got to the point--this was in high school and into college; I had a very dear friend of mine who's passed away who was a physician, Dr. Alexander [Boyd] Jordan.  We both went through school together from--it was really from about the fourth or fifth grade [At P.S. 5, Alexander Webb School, Harlem, New York, New York], and he went through the same experiences as I did.  We were really in the same class from about the fifth, sixth grade on through junior high school [at Frederick Douglass Junior High School, New York, New York], high school--DeWitt Clinton High School [Bronx, New York, New York], and we both went into Brooklyn College [New York, New York] together, and when the service came we were drafted, and when he came back, he went into NYU [New York University, New York, New York], became a track star there, and I went and continued on to Brooklyn.  But at the time that we finished school together, college, we both wanted to go into medicine for different reasons; he wanted to become a physician, I wanted to become a psychiatrist at the time, and so that was my aim.  We applied to all of the schools that were available at that time--it was 1948, and we couldn't get into any--even Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee] or, or Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], et cetera; the only schools we were admitted--that we got acceptance into was the University of Geneva in [Geneva] Switzerland, yeah; and he went, and my father [Noah Edison McMurren] (laughter) told me that he felt that we couldn't afford it, and also it wasn't accredited at the time, so he didn't allow me to go.  So, that really ended my--well, not my quest for becoming a psychiatrist because I wanted--I loved psychology.  I, I have a master's in clinical school psychology, and for a period of time I worked in the Lafargue Clinic in Harlem [New York, New York] under Dr. Wertham, Dr. Fredric Wertham and Dr. Hilde Mosse.  Dr. Fredric Wertham was a foremost authority on comic books and the effect it has on children.  Anyway, I worked under supervision with them, and I felt that that was my calling in--not psychiatry but in psychology.
Story_ID: 179665
Speaker 1: I wanna go back, but I wanna know why--where did psychology--where did that even come about as a--I mean why were you thinking along those lines--psychiatry, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: I was always interested in minds--people's minds and why an action, and how people--why people acted the way they did, and why they acted negatively or positively or whatever.  But I had an interest in people, and so that was, that was why I think I was drawn to that.
Speaker 1: How did you know that career existed?
Speaker 2: I think from reading and also from knowing a little bit about different people in the field--Dr. Kenneth [B.] Clark, I learned at that time, here too, and he went to [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York]; and it seemed that I had an uncanny ability, it seemed, to interpret dreams, and it was just on the basis of the fact that somebody would tell me this is what they dreamt about, and I'd ask them a few questions and low and behold I'd come up with some kinda theory, a, an idea of why they were dreaming what they were dreaming, and they just felt it was phenomenal.  I had a friend of mine who--really should name him--Hiram Jeeter [ph.]--he won't mind; he thought I was crazy because he said I could make a lotta money and team up with him; he would advertise, you know, and I would come and interpret the dreams.  I said, "No, that's not professional, and I can't do that."  He said, "You're never gonna make any money (laughter)."  And so--but I, I had that ability at that time.  But, at any rate I, I went, I went into teaching.
Speaker 1: But what time was that?  Are you talking about in high school you had (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, this is--this is really in college [at Brooklyn College, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: In college. Okay.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm--
Story_ID: 179666
Speaker 1: --Well, I wanna take you back to sixth grade [at P.S. 5, Alexander Webb School, Harlem, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Back where?
Speaker 1: Sixth grade.
Speaker 2: Sixth grade, oh.
Speaker 1: Yes, I wanna take you back to sixth grade and your sixth grade teacher.  Now, what was her name again, you said?
Speaker 2: His name (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Oh, his name--sorry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Amatrano.
Speaker 1: Erma?
Speaker 2: Ama.
Speaker 1: Ama (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: It's Italian--Amatrano.
Speaker 1: Oh.  Okay, can you spell that? Just in case.
Speaker 2: A-M-A-T-R-A-N-O.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And tell, tell, tell us about him and what, you know, you--he encouraged you, I guess.  Or, what did--why did he have an effect on you, I guess?
Speaker 2: He had an effect, I guess, you know as--sometimes, people learn a lot through song, and are stimulated through song and singing.  Later on in junior high school [at Frederick Douglass Junior High School, New York, New York], it was Mr. Robert [S.] Dixon; I can get on a little later with him.  He was such a person as well.  But Mr. Amatrano first instilled pride, and tried to instill pride in ourselves--yourself as a person, and also of your class and of your school--have an identity with regard to your class and your school, so much so that he devised a song for the class, (singing) "6A-1, 6A-1, 6-1, who's the greatest class alive?  6A-1, 6"--something like that, you know.  So I can remember that song that he used to sing.  But we sang that along with the school song, "Alexander Webb School was the school, soldier tried and true and he lived"--and so on and so on, and it went on with the school; that was P.S. 5, but it's named in honor of Alexander Webb who was a patriot.  But he taught us--we had a class of 6A-1 and we felt, therefore, we're the greatest class in the land because of who we are.  And he instilled pride in us in, in singing the song, and we believed that we were the greatest class, you know, aside from being a one class, which is supposed to be a top class.  He made us feel important, he made us feel that we were important to ourselves and to others.
Story_ID: 179667
Speaker 1: You were essentially tracked, right?
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: That was a track--do you know, as an educator, when tracking really began?  Did it begin around that time, or earlier?
Speaker 2: It must have been earlier, sure, because--earlier--I'm reminded of--
Speaker 1: (BRIEF INTERRUPTION)
Speaker 2: --interview, which I have inside, which I was reviewing was taken in 1989--March 21st, 1989, with one of the persons, Father Irving Anthony, who--when I became principal of the school from which I graduated [Frederick Douglass Junior High School, New York, New York], he was the acting principal of the old school that moved to the new school, and I have an interview with him and a number of other people, and he was saying that when he came from the islands first to start teaching--and surely he was, he was much older than I--he said they had the tracking situation, and he was placed in charge of, of--he was placed in a special education class, so they have a tracking special education; whatever tests they took--they gave--they would put them in different classes.  So I imagine that's how I got into the one class; they would have someone testing--whatever means.  I don't remember any formal testing, but we had tracking, and from what I can remember, I have a few other--couple of people on this island here [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts]--a dentist, Alton [L.] Wareham and Kenneth [F.] Erskine, whom I just met, they graduated from [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York]--in school--in the class--and they can remember tracking at that point in time, but they, they were in the one class--the one class, two, and three.  The one that we used to stay away from is the three class; it's supposed to be a dumb class but it really wasn't because that was outside of the first--a first, and one and two.  Anyway, they had--we had the four, five and six classes; those were classes that--where the kids supposedly weren't as smart, and they went like from 6-1 down to maybe six, eight, nine, depending on how many classes were in the grade, and then they  had special classes.  It could say six, special one--Special Ed 1, Special Ed 2, et cetera.  And so I can't really answer your question with regard to when it was started, but I'm sure it was before 1934.
Story_ID: 179668
Speaker 1: How large was your class size, too?  Do you remember that in those days, how large the class was?  Did you have a lot of students, or--
Speaker 2: In the sixth grade [at P.S. 5, Alexander Webb School, Harlem, New York, New York]? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Like in your sixth grade class (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I guess it was probably the basic standard, about thirty.
Speaker 1: Thirty?  Okay, okay, okay.
Speaker 2: Depends on how many seats there were available.  I mean I can judge it based on how many seats were available in most class rooms, and they built them so that they would be no more than so many, and so they couldn't be--the class size couldn't be any larger than that anyway.
Speaker 1: Now, you are--so he [McMurren's sixth grade teacher, Mr. Amatrano] instills in the group, and in you individually, the sense of, you know, privilege--
Speaker 2: Emm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know, and that you're special.  And are there any subjects or, you know, things--are you better at the math and sciences, are you better at, you know, English, the language arts?  What are you showing, you know, promise in, or what do you like?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I showed a lotta promise in math, and in coming out of a--say, junior high school [At Frederick Douglass Junior High School, New York, New York] where we were in the top class, within three years and two, and mathematics was one of my best subjects, it was a major shock to me when I went into DeWitt Clinton [High School, Bronx, New York, New York] and I went into--took analytic geometry, and I got an F; you know that was just so traumatic.  Until this day, now, I still think I can take an analytic geometry problem and go right straight through it.  I got to the point where I was so very good at it I got--the next year I could take it over (laughter); the next year I got an A in it.  But I'll always--I was good in mathematics, and when I first began to teach, it was in mathematics; I taught mathematics.
Story_ID: 179669
Speaker 1: So, six is the--sixth, seventh, eighth or sixth was the end, and then you started (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Six was the end of elementary school [at P.S. 5, Alexander Webb School, Harlem, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you went to--
Speaker 2: Junior high school [at Frederick Douglass Junior High School, New York, New York] was seven, eight, nine; they've changed it since; it was just middle schools--intermediate schools are six, seven and eight, usually.
Speaker 1: And you went to Frederick Douglass [Junior High School].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can you talk about, you know, that experience there?  Now, you're still continuing to be tracked, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are the students--do the students move from DeWitt [sic, P.S. 5, Alexander Webb School, Harlem, New York, New York] to Frederick Douglass?  Is that--
Speaker 2: From P.S. 5 [Alexander Webb School].
Speaker 1: P--I'm sorry, P.S. 5; I don't mean--okay; I mean, right, P.S. 5.
Speaker 2: Yeah, to Frederick Douglass.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  By and large, it depends on the neighborhood where they lived--the house where they lived.  Hmm we don't usually have that sound.  Depends on where they live.  Interesting thing is that some of the people--we still talk about this; we talked about this the other day.  This is Dr. Alton Wareham, who's a dentist who retired, who was on the island here [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts], who went to Douglass in a class of '34 [1934].  We were saying the parents felt that they wanted--didn't want their children to go to Frederick Douglass because it was an all-black boys' school, and therefore they could not learn that much from that kinda school, and they wanted, therefore, to send their children, or their child, to [Edward W.] Stitt Junior High School [Washington Heights, New York, New York], which is up a little further and was integrated.  So--and we were making the, the contention here that those persons who, who went to Douglass got a much better education than those who went to Stitt; I can't prove that statistically, but just based on those I know that went to Douglass--went to Stitt, as opposed to those who went to Douglass, and we know of the teachers who were at--they can't remember--say, you take the average person who went to Stitt, they hardly can remember any of the teachers they had, when the Douglass persons can remember just about all the teacher they had, and that they made a major impression upon them, and these people are successful people.
Speaker 1: Now--so, so when you went to Douglass, what--who are--it's 1930--five--
Speaker 2: Seven [1937].
Speaker 1: Seven, okay, I was gonna say '35 [1935].  Okay, so it's 1937.  Can you, at this point, tell a little bit about the history of the school, you know, what it's history was?
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Or is?
Speaker 2: Well, I wrote--story on the history of Douglass, basically, in the beginning because when people began more to realize how important that school was and for the people who came outta the school, and I'm not gonna read from the history I know (laughter).  Basically, it started in 1924 when a teacher who was a music teacher by the name of Robert S. Dixon, who was famous, and a lotta people know him because he taught us all the songs that we know when--whenever--and so many other songs; not just of Douglass but others I can still remember to the day, but--and classical music; all kinds of things he exposed us to.
Story_ID: 179670
Speaker 1: So we're talking about the history of [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, the history of Douglass.  This is Robert S. Dixon who gathered the students and staff members of the first school, the first class of Douglass; they  marched from what was a night club on the hill--it was a hill on 140th Street and Seventh Avenue [New York, New York].  Now, it's called Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, but it was Seventh Avenue, and he marched to the school, which was located on 140th Street between Lennox and Seventh Avenues, and that was the beginning of Douglass.  And so (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: What year was that? (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Nineteen twenty-four [1924].
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you just said that.
Speaker 2: And so that school began.  And the school apparently attracted so many noteworthy persons who became noteworthy at any rate; Countee Cullen was one, and he was a great person--poet--known, well-known, as a poet, and he taught French in his--he had years in France, et cetera.  Mr. Harcore Tynes [ph.], whom, on one of the articles I have here on my becoming a principal and saying that I was--I could relate to Harlem [New York, New York] and the students and all as principal, I was so blessed to be in that position.  And I said because I had such wonderful teachers at the school where I did attend, and one which was Harcore Tynes who was, and I quote, "Teaching Negro history before it was popular."  He was teaching us Negro history then.
Speaker 1: Now, how--but what--it was part of the public school system but--I'm just trying to understand it; I understand there was a march, but what--how did it come about--into being?  You know, how within (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Board of Education decided they would have a school in Harlem--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and it should be; however, it came, and fortunately, the name Frederick Douglass.  And they assembled a staff from the Board of Education, and the students, apparently, you know, were invited from those who lived in the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: But boys.
Speaker 2: All boys.  They had an all-boys' school at that time, and they started--it may have been simultaneously--had to be because they had to have some provision for the girls.  A boys' school--this girls' school was Harriet Beecher Stowe [Intermediate School, New York, New York], and that was for all girls--a junior high school.  Although when we began celebrating Douglass and Douglass gentlemen and Douglass alumni, before we had the point when I became principal of the new school, that was the first time girls were allowed to come in or were not--I shouldn't say allowed to, but were also part of the school.  And we were talking about history of Douglass, et cetera and all of the Douglass alumni.  So we had one teacher there who said, "I'm an alumnus of Douglass."  I said, "What do you mean you're alumnus of Douglass?"  She knows--now we know how old she is.  "How could you be an alumnus of Douglass?"  She says, "Well, as it turns out, when Douglass first started in 1924, they had a kindergarten that was housed in that school."  And she was in the kindergarten 'til the third grade; her name was Catherine Wilson [ph.].  And so she says, "And so I, too, am an alumnus of Douglass."  (Laughter), so we had to permit that--with great pleasure.
Story_ID: 179671
Speaker 1: So now, at [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York], did you have a sense of--because by the time you get there, its 1937, '38 [1938]?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And so the school is literally probably been around for fourteen years.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  So, do you get a, a sense of--you know, like you're sixth grade teacher, Amatratta [sic, Amatrano], made you feel special.  Do you feel special here, or what happens within the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I felt very special in Frederick Douglass Junior High School in '39 [1939] initially because we had a teacher that thought so much of us and was so close to us that she wanted to become--remained the teacher throughout our entire schooling at Douglass.  See, what we had was what they call RA-7A-1 RA--Rapid Advance; 7A-1, 8A-1 RB, and then you had 9A-1 RC and RD.  And so we would--in the seventh grade, we did two years and one--two terms in one term, so one term because the terms were September to January; that was a school term, and you say you're 7A, you know, and then to the eighth grade, or 7B; 7A and 7B, all right?  You get 7A and say 7B in one year, seventh grade and the eighth grade--I'm sorry--in one year, and then the ninth grade, one full year; that's what it was.  Seventh and eighth in one year, so we did 7A and 7B in the first term, and 8A and 8B in the second term, and that was one year.  And then we went to the ninth grade and did a full year in the ninth grade.
Speaker 1: Now, who were your teachers?
Speaker 2: We had a teacher, Mrs. Atkinson [ph.]; she desired to be with us for the entire time we were there; she just fell in love with us.  She was a good teacher--very strict science teacher, and we had departmentals, you know, so it's not one teacher teaching all the subjects as in common branches--you had, so, we would move in different--have a math teacher and then a science teacher and then a physical ed teacher, et cetera.  But she was--she made a major impression upon us initially.  Then we went to music; we had Mr. Robert [S.] Dixon, as I--he was the one that was, was--is really alleging, and taught us so many songs, and he was just a person that we respected so highly, and so many of the people, through the many years, remember him.  And a lot of the people say, "Do you remember Rip Day [ph.]?"--Herschel Rip Day [ph.]--yes, they do because there was a father and a son; they remember mostly not the Poppa Day, they say, but Rip, the young son, had a shrill voice but he was a hard task-master and he was a person in charge of physical education.  And I mean you had to do whatever it was; you had to do it--whatever.  I mean he was very strict and right down to the letter and whatever.  So we had a lotta respect for him because he didn't disrespect us; he made us feel good, and feel like we are somebody, basically.  And--but we had to do what we're supposed to do to be proud of ourselves and proud--have your parents proud of you, and me proud of you, and you--and more important, be proud of yourself; yeah, that kinda thing.  So he instilled that in us.  And we had a number of other teachers; we had a math teacher, Mrs. Amanda Kim [ph.], and this--these were the days when corporal punishment was allowed, and so it wasn't because we misbehaved that we might be struck--punish; it was because we didn't learn our lesson.  So if we came home and didn't do our homework or didn't do it or didn't know the thing we were supposed to turn--learn the timetable or whatever, we would have a choice.  "Okay," and she had her ruler and says, "Do you want it all in one hand, or shall I divide the two?  And you know what divide means--10 here and 10 there" (laughter)--that kinda thing.  So you take 10 smacks in this hand, and 10 smacks in that one.  But, anyway, with math--she was a excellent math teacher--she taught us math.  Mrs. Gumpert [ph.] was our civics teacher.  And we learned--just learned so much from all of the teachers, and most of the people--and they stayed there such a long time, and few--very few of us--in a lot of other schools they didn't have any black teachers, and we had Mr. Harcore Tymes [ph.], Mr. Dixon was black--Negro, as they used to call it at the time, and Mrs. Kim [ph.] was as well.  I had a French teacher, Miss Chase [ph.], who was white--from France; she was a good teacher.  All of the teachers we had were, we felt, very good, and gave us a lot of inspiration and made us feel that we were somebody and wanted always to ascribe to be somebody.
Story_ID: 179672
Speaker 1: So that, that set the stage for a lot of things; it was sort of kept--capping off--I wanna know how you matured in that, you know, those two years--period, you know, at [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Hmm.  Well, when I, when I left that school, I felt I was ready for anything; I mean I felt I could tackle any job, any, any kind of task or whatever was offered, whatever problem, situation; I just felt equipped to do so.  And I just felt that--I had a lotta pride in whatever I did, and I think more importantly, I had a lotta respect for other people 'cause they taught us respect for other people; they demanded that.  When we disrespected people, they really called that to our attention and made sure we realized what we were doing and why, and why we should not do that, and that made a great impression upon us.  And so many of the same--I say that because I was--that was all my own little world there, and of course a few others like that said--Dr. [Alexander Boyd] Jordan, whom I grew up with, he felt the same way, and a few other people.  But here, I learned that persons who graduated in 1929, I know; in '34 [1934], '37 [1937], '39 [1939], and '40 [1940] and '42 [1942], and I talk with all of them, different individuals, and they all feel the same about that.  And even until this day, we have people who graduated at the time, or who were going to school at the time I was principal, they have said how much Douglass, at that time--here, this is twenty more years later, has meant to them.  And when Art [ph.] is here--I'm expecting to hear any--hear from any day--Sam Brown, who I've got some of his artwork here, and he tells how great an impression Douglass made upon him as he went to Douglass, you know.  This is in, I guess, in the '60s [1960s]--late '70s [1970s]; in the '70s [1970s] when girls were going as--well, women--females.  But I'd say out of that is just a, a, a--I just gained so much and I think it stayed with me, whatever it was, it stayed with me.  I can remember I learned to concentrate on memory and remembering a lotta things, and people are amazed, including my wife [Jean McMurren], they are amazed at some of the--as I think I told you, some of--poems I can recite--I can sit here and recite a full poem maybe about 20, 30, 40 stanzas just--you know, like 'A [sic, The] House With Nobody In It'; I don't know if you ever remember that, you know, by Joyce Kilmer.  You know, 'Invictus' is--which is more conventional.  You hear of--ever hear of 'Invictus'?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: No, but let me (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: "Out of the night that covers me black as a pit from pole-to-pole; I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.  In fell clutch of circumstance"--goes on like that.  And then it ends up with the famous words--it ends up, it says, "It matters not how strait the gate or how charged with punishment the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am captain of my soul."  That's by William Ernest Henley.  But things like that I can remember--
Story_ID: 179673
Speaker 1: Let's talk about DeWitt [Clinton High School, Bronx, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: DeWitt Clinton?
Speaker 1: Yes--high school 'cause you, you know, go from junior high [at Frederick Douglass Junior High School, New York, New York] to high school, and so--
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --so, can you talk about that, and--
Speaker 2: DeWitt Clinton.  We've got a large group of people who will always sing the praises of DeWitt Clinton; we could get together now and sing the song, (singing) "DeWitt, C-L-I-N-T-O-N, DeWitt"--okay.  But, anyway, we got a number of people out of one group of African Americans who are--some of whom came from [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York] and some of whom came from [Edward W.] Stitt [Junior High School, Washington Heights, New York, New York] and from other schools, and went to--well, they went to--they finally ended up in DeWitt Clinton.  And they--DeWitt Clinton, as a result of--this is African Americans primarily, who came outta Harlem [New York, New York]--they formed what we later call 'the thirty-year friends' because after thirty years for graduating--after graduating from Douglass--from DeWitt Clinton, which was about thirty years after '42 [1942], which was '72 [1972].  Around 1972, we formed 'thirty-year friends,' and I have some pictures around here of the thirty-year friends, and many of us still are in touch with one another, and every once in a while, we'll maybe get together, generally.  So many of 'em have passed on, but there was somethin' very special about DeWitt Clinton as well because of a carry-over from Douglass, in our case, to DeWitt Clinton; not so much that we remembered so many of the teachers, but we had developed such a spirit of togetherness--whether somebody lived on 139th Street [New York, New York] where I was, or down 120th Street, or maybe [HM The Honorable] Basil Paterson, who became a [New York] state senator, and we were close friends; he, he went to [James Fenimore] Cooper Junior High School [New York, New York] but we all ended up in DeWitt Clinton, and we graduated the same year.  And we got so many things in common with regard to our camaraderie, and so--not so much--it's just the aura of DeWitt Clinton, the fact that it was a school that had a lot of spirit--school spirit, but at the same time the people, those who went to DeWitt Clinton, developed close relationships as high school students, even if it was supporting the athletic events or whatever it may be, and finally graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School.
Story_ID: 179674
Speaker 1: So, what--was there anything important about DeWitt [Clinton High School, Bronx, New York, New York] in terms of your development?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I learned--I learned a lot academically because it was a good school.
Speaker 1: What was the racial makeup?
Speaker 2: Oh--well, at, at that time, I imagine there may have been maybe 20 percent African American, 5 to 10 percent Hispanic, and the rest white, and primarily Jewish persons--some Italians, but that was basically makeup; it was a school in the Bronx on Mosholu Parkway.
Speaker 1: And you're still excelling in math.
Speaker 2: Excelling?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Sometimes I can't add two and two, but yes (laughter).
Speaker 1: No, no, I mean at DeWitt (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh (laughter).  Yes, I'm glad you made that distinction because now, yeah; as I told you, as age has become--come upon me and claimed me, yes--in math.  But I--as I think about it now, there too, I had a major problem, it was in--what I was saying--the first time it was geometry--plain geometry, and the second time it was analytic geometry that I had a major problem with in high school, but I, I overcame that after the first year.  And the matter of failing--and I think most of us that I know; most of our friends and thirty-year friends, we never thought of failing; we don't have--didn't have many failers; there were some people who might have dropped out--we don't remember who they may have been; a number of--couple of people died name--a person who would have been of great--I think--or made a major impression in the world if he was still living, his name was James Barker [ph.], he would have been a foremost attorney; he did come out of DeWitt Clinton.  But we had a lotta camaraderie, a lot of close--we didn't countenance failure, and if we did, we were always helping one another.  And I'd say our teachers helped us, too; we had teachers we could go to to help--get help.
Speaker 1: And is this--you're saying also at this time that you wanted to become--you, you thought you wanted to be a psychiatrist.
Speaker 2: I don't--I don't think I had, I don't think I had that in mind at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I believe in my yearbook--and I still have the yearbook--I think I listed that I wanted to become a teacher--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I think that was because my father [Noah Edison McMurren] said that's what I should become (laughter).  I was governed a lot by what my father said to me.  So he said, "You should become a teacher."  And I think at the time, he'd said, "Put down what you wanna become."  And I said, "Oh, a teacher."  And I remember--'cause I remember they ask you put down your--or any kinds of special words, proverbs or whatever you would go by, and I'd say, "And he told me this," and I put it--I mouthed and put it down--"Persist, persist, and still persist" (laughter).  So, in other words, don't ever give up, whatever you're trying to do.  So I felt that was a good motto.  I think they said, "What is your motto?"  And that's in my book--"Persist, persist, and still persist."
Speaker 1: So that's really your, your, your--it could be your saying, too--favorite phrase or saying, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's true.
Speaker 1: But now--so wasn't it around this time that you and your friend applied for school together, or was that late (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the end of college [at Brooklyn College, New York, New York] (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Oh, at the end of college.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Okay, sorry, okay.
Story_ID: 179675
Speaker 1: How do you end up choosing where you wanna go to school?  I mean is that--or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was fortunate throughout my entire school life; my parents never had to pay anything for my education.  When I graduated from high school [at DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx, New York, New York], I applied for college, the city colleges, and they had a--you had to use your high school average, combined with the entrance mark that you'd make on your college exam to find out what college you'd go to.  And as it turns out, I miss City College [of New York, New York], which was within walkin' distance from my home, by one point somethin', and I had to go to Brooklyn College [New York, New York] which was one hour's subway ride away; so I went to Brooklyn College, and that's a free college.  And, of course, when I had laboratory periods in the morning, I had to get up say like 5:30, six o'clock, to get to my first lab which would be eight o'clock, see?--would travel one hour on the train.  But--so, the choice was based on what might a pay college versus a free college, and the city colleges were free, and so--if you could get into it.  If you couldn't pass the test, then you'd have to go to a college where you have to pay, unless you're elected anyway, to go to college.  Some people wanted to go to a black college--wanted to go and the parents would pay for it--Hampton [University, Hampton, Virginia]--one of my friends graduated and went to Hampton, others went to other schools, you know.  And then, when it came to a master's program, I got a free master's program at City College; I got a master's in education, so--and then when I--I had a, when I went to war--we went to war--I came back I had a New York State veteran's scholarship; and so I never really used all of that.

Speaker 1: So you got drafted, did you get drafted? (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: I was drafted, yeah (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Okay.  And you served in the China-Burma-Indian War [sic, Theater]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How much is--you don't hear that very often.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: So, can you talk a little about, you know, where that, you know, what you were doing over there, and--okay.
Speaker 2: Happy to do so because that's part of what I was writing about in the book, too, because I was drafted, and of course was just, just--almost immediately as I became eighteen, two weeks later I got my greeting notices and, and I was draft--it was October 21st, 19--was it--whatever, and I was eighteen, and then January, I was in the service already--see.  I didn't spend much time in the states, and they--I'm supposed to go to office--I'm supposed to go to a specialized training program--I'd applied for that.  We went down to--well it went in a series.  Anyway, I ended up in Truax Field [Air National Guard Base] in Madison, Wisconsin, and from--after bein' in--first, in Biloxi, Mississippi, then we went to Truax Field, and then we were shipped to Newport News [Virginia] to go overseas.  It was interesting to note that we were in a chorus at that time, and we were so good we were invited to perform onstage and--as a group of soldiers.  We perform onstage and we had a director who was, was singing A cappella; he went backstage and, and hit the wrong chord and one of--we were supposed to sing 'This is My Country,' and he hit the wrong chord and he came out and we started singing, and we knew we didn't get out--you know, he was supposed to hit the chord and you get your key and your note, but instead of stopping us, he went back into--backstage, and didn't come back out; and we think that was the reason they shipped us overseas.  Because right after that, they said, "Let's get rid of--they disgraced us--the [U.S.] Army" (laughter); "send 'em overseas."  And probably they said--probably they said--I can see the commanders--hear them saying, "Send 'em as far away as they possibly can" (laughter).  And so I ended up going to Newport News, sailing straight down the Eastern Coast of the United States, down through the Panama Canal, up around Australia, all the way to the west coast of India, and that was Bombay [India]; and we then went from Bombay to Calcutta [India], and then from Calcutta to Dacca [Bangladesh]; Dacca was where, in India, where we were stationed; it's a 1345th Army Air Force Base, and then they had a 1346 Army Air Force Base which is adjoining, and they were all white and we were all of color.  And it's always interesting--I've asked a number of people, I said--who were in the [U.S.] Air Force--I said, "Do you know of, in your travels, wherever you went, wherever there was a Squadron F"--and that we were in Squadron F--"It was all African Americans?"  And everywhere we went, Squadron F was always--but anyway, I was in a Squadron F, and they--it was a good experience there 'cause I was then a sort of a non-commissioned officer, almost a top ranking, which might be a top sergeant.  And then they selected me with one white soldier from the 1346, to go to OCS, Officer's Candidate School, in Fort Seal, Oklahoma, which is interesting because as we left Dacca going--we were traveling together, and wherever--whatever bunk we had--we went to Agra, India, we went to Karachi [Pakistan], went to Avadan, Iran, Casablanca, Morocco, and the Azores.  We were always given one bunk after another, bunked side-by-side, all the way--halfway around the world, until we got--'til we landed in Florida--Miami Beach, Florida, and that was our, our country; that's the first time we were separated (laughter).  That was just strange, you know--separated, after comin' all the way overseas; and on the way up to the Mason-Dixon line we were separated because I was behind a coal car and he was up--before I would see him whenever we had lunch, they would have the curtains there, and I'd see him; we'd peep around and he'd wave to me, I'd wave to him.  Whenever they stop, we would get out and we'd talk and then they'd say, "All aboard," and then I'd go back behind the coal car and he'd go into wherever he was, until we got to the Mason-Dixon line, which was on Washington [D.C.], and then we're able to sit together until we travel on up.  But that was a story of--on our way to Officers Candidate School.  But I, I like to tell that story because it was--it's something--
Story_ID: 179677
Speaker 1: And then the second part of that with regard to the service--I don't wanna get ahead of the story, but when I came back from the service, and I was down in Montgomery, Alabama--I was stationed in Maxwell Air Field in Montgomery, Alabama, and I remember I had all of these medals--I've had some battle stars and all of from India and all--and in uniform.  My first day out to go on a pass, I went out and got on the bus, and I got on the bus.  As I got on the bus, the bus was crowded with persons, Caucasian persons, in the front of the bus.  And so the rule always that Negroes had to sit in--start filling up from the back, the white from the front.  So, because they didn't want me to walk through and rub shoulders with any of the people, I had to pay my fare and get out, and go around to the back and get on the exit to get on so I wouldn't go and, you know, through the front with the whites.  But it was interesting because here is, you know, got my medals on and been fightin' for my country and all of that, but that's a situation when I--I, I always relate that to Rosa Parks.  I said, "In Montgomery, Alabama," I said, "This was probably the same bus"--maybe, you know (laughter).  Say, ten years later, she said, "I'm not gonna move," and that started the Montgomery Boycott and, and all of that, and [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]'s emergence as a world leader.
Story_ID: 179678
Speaker 1: Now, you--when you were in the--at the Burma--the China-Burma-India [Theater]--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: Burma-India--(simultaneous)
Speaker 1: They called it theaters.  Are (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, CBI [China Burma India], yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, CBI.  When you were there, one it was--you, you've seen parts of the world you've never seen before.
Speaker 2: You're right, that's correct.
Speaker 1: --Okay, and that is eye-opening, I would assume.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, I flew over the Taj Mahal [Agra, India] and that was just a--quite an experience.
Speaker 1: And are you doing any flying?  Are you--you're in the [U.S. Army] Air Force but you're on the ground.
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.  I was in Army Air Force and was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.  What is the Army Air--'cause it's the air--what is the Army Air Force?
Speaker 2: It's not the air corps--see there, you have the air corps--we have a few friends who are Tuskegee Airmen, and one went to school with me; we were in the fourth grade together.  He's a Tuskegee Airman and one of my--a number of my friends.  But, you know, they had the segregated course, and they felt that the negroes were--should not be trained to be pilots because they would not fly well; probably wouldn't fly well and wouldn't do a good job, and that's why they didn't want them to fly in combat, so they relegated them to just escorting bombers, you see, and that's what they were doin' a lot of, 'til they had the 30--32nd--99th Pursuit Squadron under Colonel Davis.  But you've got a lotta stories; and they are now telling this story on a regular basis.  Dr. Yenwith Whitney, who was one of my dear friends, and Nasby Wynn, they go around telling the story of the Tuskegee Airmen and how they came about and what was involved, and the problems and trials and tribulations they faced.  And it's eye-opening, and they've got books on it now, as well.  But it's something about history that people weren't completely aware of.  But this is the army air corps; I was in the--I wanted to become a pilot but I, I was not able to because I had a 20-30 vision and should have--you had to have 20-20 vision, so I didn't make it.
Speaker 1: So you--anything else significant about the service--of your time in the service besides--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --I was in there for two years and was glad to get out because I wanna go back to school. (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Right, okay, and glad to get out, right.
Story_ID: 179679
Speaker 1: So, you get back, and you go back to Brooklyn [New York, New York].  You ha--your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Went back to Brooklyn College [New York, New York], right.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: College, okay.  And--to get your, your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Bachelor, baccalaureate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, bachelor's, okay.  And then you graduate in nine--what year is this now?
Speaker 2: Actually in '49 [1949], although I went to school up in '48 [1948]; I had one course that I had to take--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so technically, it's 1949.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I was in attendance only up until 1948.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And this is the time that you're thinking that you wanna go and be a psychiatrist.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I want--now, when did you come to know--I mean I know you probably knew of him or meet Dr. Kenneth Clark.  Was he--when, when did that--
Speaker 2: Well, this was because of him just bein' raised in Harlem [New York, New York]; he was--they had what they called the Northside Center for Child Development, and he and his wife Mamie [Clark] founded that group, so that was primarily my contact.  And later I knew, and became aware, of the fact that he graduated from [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York].  And since that time, what happened was when I became principal of the new school, we decided that--to make sure that youngsters would be aware of many of the figures in African American history, and those related to Frederick Douglass; we decided to name--and I as principal and got consultation of all the executive cabinet and then the staff.  In concurrence, we would name our various special sections of the school in honor of, or in memory of, those persons.  So, for instance, Dr. Kenneth Clark--we had a conference room; it was right near the principal's office--we call it the Dr. Kenneth Clark Conference Room.  We invited him to come and he came, too.  Have some pictures of him there, too with us.  Brock Peters was a noted actor and graduate of Douglass; we invited him, and he came with his wife, his mother, and his child, and they had an assembly program, and we dedicated the Brock Peters Auditorium in his honor, see?  Then, we had Dr. Edward Carpenter; he was a noted psychologist--guidance counselor, and so we called that the, the Guidance Suite, which had four guidance counselors--the Dr. Edward F. Carpenter Guidance Suite, you see?  So, that was basically what we did with some of the names, but Dr. Clark was one of those at the time.
Story_ID: 179680
Speaker 1: --You finish Brooklyn College [New York, New York].  Now, is it your thought that you're gonna teach at this point?  And is there any student--student teaching thats a part of it?
Speaker 2: Well, I still was interested in psychology.  I even worked at--I think I told you, Lafargue Clinic [Harlem, New York, New York], which is--I did a little psych--psychiatric supervision--under supervision--I did some psychiatric therapy under supervision of Dr. Mosse--Hilde Mosse and Dr. Fredric Wertham.  But primarily then, at the same time, I was asked to become director of the Methodist Camp Service, so I went into social work and, and then right--while I was in that capacity, I was invited to become a teacher at [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York], by one of my dear friends, Dr. Roy G. Phillips.  And so I came over, was interviewed by the principal, and he asked me what subject I could teach; I told him math.  He says, "I have a math program, but it's also partly Spanish," and so that's another story I could tell you about that.  But any rate, I started teaching math and Spanish.  I only taught really for--actually about a little over a year or so--oh, up to two years, and then they decided that I could become dean.  I think it was three years because I was havin' such success in all of the roughest kids, and they would even say, "Well, if you--we're gonna give you one more chance," they'd tell the kid--the principal might tell the child, "We'll give you one more chance, we're gon' put you in Mr. McMurren's class; if you don't succeed in there, we're gonna suspend you."  So my class was a last-chance class.  So--but I was having such great success with the most difficult students.  And so when Mr. Porter--Herman Porter was another legend; he was there when I was a student.  He was elevated to assistant principal, they made me dean.  So I was dean for about five years--as dean of students, yes.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That was for--that was meteor--meteoric--
Speaker 2: Dean of students, yeah.
Speaker 1: Right, so you--do you think your time with the Methodist Youth Services plus your sort of natural knack and interest in the psychology of things helped in that process?
Speaker 2: I did, because actually, I continued being director.  There was a big decision I had to make because I asked them how much teachers were making.  At that time, I was making $3800 a year; that was a lotta money at that time (laughter)--$3800 a year.  The teacher's salary, at that time, was $3300--starting teacher--$3,300.  And I said I had to think of whether I would drop it $500 a year to go into teaching, so--but anyway, as it worked out, I decided; we worked out something where I would teach from 9--from 8:30 to 3:00, and work in the camp service most of the year--
Story_ID: 179681
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you are dean [at Frederick Douglass Junior High School, New York, New York] and--in three years.  Okay, and do your responsibilities change some in terms of, you know, the role as dean and the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, out of--I'm outta the classroom fully.  And so, actually, my job is just to handle any discipline cases--whenever they are presented to me.  At that time, they allowed corporal punishment but I had--I can't remember very--any--hardly any times that I used a ruler or hit, hit a youngster, but we were allowed to do so at the time.  But I felt that wasn't the answer, and most times I would talk with them to find out, you know, like, "Why are you here?"  Or I'd say, "Why are you here again?"  You know--et cetera.  "We talked before," et cetera, et cetera.  But I found I was a--very successful in talking with the youngsters and hopefully re-directing them, and some of the people, years later, used to tell me how effective I was and what I--the things I said and what, what it meant to them.  I remember one time a kid really went way off, and I did haul off and hit him and, you know, I said, "Why did you have to make me do that to you?"  You know--well, any way--but he turned, he turned around; I, I think I had just about a 100 percent success--very few people we had to suspend, and whenever my principal took me to any suspension hearings, the people would look at me, they say, "Oh, you're Mr. McMurren."  I said, "Yes."  Said, "Well, we heard a lot about you; you do a tremendous job over there, but we expect to see a giant; we thought we'd saw somebody about 6'2, you know, comin' over here."  I say, "No," I say "No, it's not the matter of the size or anything."  They say, "What's the secret of your success?"  I says, "Well, I try to talk with them, and I try to see what the problem is and try to get at the base of it and work it out together--that's basically simply what I do."  So--and I think that's really what I did at the time.  It was good, good years that I spent there and I felt they were very productive.
Speaker 1: Now, you--then you became acting assist--what happened the principal?  The principal--you became act--(simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't act--I was acting assistant principal (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Principal--that's what I'm saying, acting assistant principal.
Speaker 2: Yeah, that was just for a very short (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: That was--okay, okay, okay.  And then--so you were there thirt--how many years?  You were--
Speaker 2: Well, well, there---maybe about five--well, three, three years a teacher--five--about ten years, eleven years or so 'cause I was a career guidance advisor there at the same time, too.  I think what happened is I passed the test for a guidance counselor; you know, you might have been an active assistant principal, but you're not gettin' paid, so a guidance counselor got more money.  So I was--took the test for guidance counselor, so I was a guidance counselor at Junior High School 45 [New York, New York] for, I think, about a year, and then I was--I think right after that I was selected for the Instructional Administrator's Program at Fordham University [Bronx, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And went there.
Speaker 2: --and went there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 179682
Speaker 1: Okay.  And that's where you got your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: After a whole year (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: That's right.  That's where you got your--
Speaker 2: It was a professional diploma (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Professional development.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Professional diplomas--IAP [Instructional Administrator's Program, Fordham University, Bronx, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Now, you--okay, so just take--take me on, then.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You, you go on to--I wanna take you to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right beyond the teaching?
Speaker 1: Huh?
Speaker 2: Right after teaching I went in--I took another test, and passed it, for assistant principal--to be paid--after guidance counselor--at a ju--elementary school.  So I assistant principal--paid elementary school assistant principal for a year until I was--that's, that's--right after that is when I got into the program.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Fordham program.
Speaker 1: Your, Fordham program, okay.  And then you--when did you go back to get your master's?
Speaker 2: I already had my master's.
Speaker 1: You had your master's.
Speaker 2: Nineteen-Fifty [1950].
Speaker 1: Nineteen-Fifty [1950].  Okay, okay, I'm sorry.  Then, should I ask about the evening community center, when you were working there, at all, or--but that was during (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That was before.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was a teacher of health education in the evening community center.  That was my first job as--really as a teacher as such; but it was in the evening community center.  And that was before I--before I went into teaching on a regular basis--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you--okay, let me then--you become deputy--at what--at what time do you become deputy superintendent?
Speaker 2: Well, that's a--quite a skip.
Speaker 1: It's a skip.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: What happened was, first I became a--I was an assistant principal, I was--at that point in time, they selected sixty people, and I was one of the first twenty of three groups of twenty, selected by Fordham University, by the Board of Education, to become a--go into training under the Ford Foundation grant that was given to Fordham University to train African American and Hispanic supervisors--to become supervisors because in the whole city of New York, there, at that time, were fewer than twelve licensed assistant principals; everybody else was acting assistant principals, or supervisors, in the entire city of New York.  So they felt they wanted to equalize that or at least compensate for that, so that's how Fordham got this grant to train us in instructional administration, so that we would be qualified to be selected as assistant principals or principals let's say.  So it was very timely for me because at the completion of that was--the second part of that was an internship, along with a theory in practice and all of that.  We had a good foundation in instructional administration; we were able to visit various schools to get what their best theoretical and practical teaching aspects were in administration and supervision-- how to administer a school, how to supervise a school as a principal, et cetera; so it was a very important area--learning situation, and very timely because right at that point is when they were opening up the new Frederick Douglass Intermediate School 10 [New York, New York], and they were seeking a principal.  And so this is at the advent of community control, so we had quite a--something, and whenever they have a school board meeting, you know, they're vying for one person or the other, and a lotta people backin' one person, a lotta people backin' another, and it was quite, quite something--political and otherwise.  But as it turns out, I was fortunate enough to be selected as the first principal of the new school--Frederick Douglass--and that's where I began, and I was there for thirteen years.
Speaker 1: Right, okay--
Story_ID: 179683
Speaker 1: Tell me how though, they decided to, to create this, this school--the Frederick [Douglass Intermediate School 10, New York, New York]--as an intermediate school.  I mean it was already increa--why do you call it the--why are saying--
Speaker 2: Well, they--it was a junior high school before; I think this is at 139 (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I think at that time--now, I'm not completely sure as to whether--I think it was still seven, eight, nine (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: So when six (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --but they, they lobbed off the--and what it include; I think because of the number of students--they wanted to include the sixth grade and they wanted to include girls as well.  So they said in this new school, there will be girls and boys, ages six--grades six through eight, and so we started off with, with two thousand--about two thousand students--sixth, seventh and eighth grades.  And they were--and that's how the new school was created.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we had quite a few classes; I had about seven assistant principals and seven--six, six or seven secretaries, and four guidance counselors, and about near three hundred teachers and other supervisors.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And the students were drawn from what area then?  Were they drawn from further (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: From basically, basically.
Speaker 1: Still within the neighborhood.  Okay, okay (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: Basically a neighborhood school.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 179684
Speaker 1: I wanna address--with Fordham [University, Bronx, New York, New York], you felt that you had learned, you know, it was--you felt it [the Instructional Administrator's Program] was a good program.
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, no question about it.  Yeah, it equipped me to, I think--what--I felt confident in handling almost any situation and, and so, therefore, that was quite a challenge to, to take this new school, but I had also a couple of wonderful blessings; the blessings were in fact that the person that I had--when I was a student, he was a teacher, and he was the one--he became a, a acting principal, was Father [Irving] Anthony, and he came to the new school; he was formally then the last principal of the old school before it became the new Frederick Douglass IS [Intermediate School] 10 [New York, New York], and I made him my administrative assistant.  And I always told people how blessed I was to have somebody of his wisdom, background and experience, as my right-hand person, to be able to turn to if I had problems in situations and questions, you see?  I was fortunate because I had a lot of people in CSA, the Counselors, Supervisors, Administrators and others--colleagues who were readily available to me if I wanted to call up and say, "How do you--what do you think about this?"  And "How do you think I should act over here?"--or whatever, so I was in a very good position.  Plus, we still had a number of the former students who went to Douglass and came back to teach who came to this new school, and were therefore--I was the principal of--some of them were made deans, like one, Dr. Ed Lilly [ph.], I made him one of my deans; he was teaching social studies, and then I made him a dean.  And, as it turns out, when I retired, he hired me as a (laughter) adjunct associate professor because he was chairman of the department when he left, and got his doctorate, and left and was at City College [of New York, New York], you know?  But we had that caliber of a person there.  So we had a good session for first eight or nine years of the school--running the school.  The last four years, up to the time I became deputy superintendent, we were faced with quite a few problems, mostly budget cuts from, from the city; they just slashed the budgets.  We lost teachers, we lost students--it was really chaotic; it shows how much damage can be done to schools that are running well, when they cut the staff.  Saying we have a--he is a wonderful, great person--maybe he just came on staff and say, "Sorry, you know, seniority"--we have to let them go.  I say, "Well, you know, well, if I have a choice, I'd rather keep that person," but I have no choice--so seniority and whatever.  So, we had some rough times in the last three or four years, but basically it was thirteen good years.  That was one of the years where, as we talked about James Baldwin.  I, I went to school at the same time-- [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York]--went to school and James Baldwin was there; he was one term ahead of me and Dr. Alexander Jordan.  We were on the Douglass Pilot together, and we could see at that time what his potential was.  Mr. Herman Porter was a person in charge, and we had Lloyd [ph.] as a wonderful teacher.  He saw Baldwin's talent, and encouraged it, too--made him editor-in-chief of the Douglass Pilot, and he went on to DeWitt Clinton [High School, Bronx, New York, New York] after that.  But we had such wonderful people there at Douglass, and to have them come on and stay on and be part of, of the staff helped to contribute to my success.
Story_ID: 179685
Speaker 1: I wanna go back a little bit to the time, you know, that you're at Fordham [University, Bronx, New York, New York] and, and I want you to paint a--the sort of picture of the circumstances within the public school system, you know, with minority teachers.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You said that there were only five (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: No, there are fewer than twelve.
Speaker 1: Oh, there were fewer than twelve, okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, about twelve.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And, and were, were teachers--I had heard at one point that people--teachers could not--that they--they were--a lot of them--and this may be earlier--could only be substitute teachers.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: Was that around that time, or was that earlier?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We, we felt--to a great extent, and we find later substantiation for it, that it was basic discrimination, and ways and means of keeping persons of color out of teaching positions, and keepin' 'em in substitute positions and relegating them to those tasks, in spite of what their talents may be.  We found that to be the case in a, in a number of cases, and so in, in Harlem [New York, New York] schools it was prevalent, too--still in Harlem schools.  But when we had more supervisors who were African American and, and Hispanic, we found that--able to deal with that more effectively, and encourage teachers to go ahead and, and even had special coaching classes for the license exams, you know?
Speaker 1: And who was leading the charge?  You mentioned about, you know, politicians getting involved; who was leading the charge on behalf of the teachers, you know, during--you know, do you remember, in the community?
Speaker 2: Well, we had a lot of individual persons.  We had a number of people who were encouraging--Dr. John B. King was one; he was--applied to been a principal, and he went to work for Fordham University, and he was on the one's encourage--encouraging; Fred Williams just recently passed away--he became the first director of Human Relations for the [New York] Board of Education, and he's with personnel as well.  And through trying to work with, talk with, be close to a lot of the things and a lot of the happenings, were able to get a little inside this, inside that, and be able to overcome some of the problems that we did face.  Plus, we became, sometimes (laughter), fair-headed boys, of some of the people who were in powered positions--you know, "I like Lionel"--and "Let's like give him a break," you see?  "He's a good person, you know."  So, all of that combined with, you know--a push, basically, to try to make sure that we got our fair share.  There were some people in the UFT, United Federations of Teachers, that were trying to assist, as well.
Speaker 1: And--but that, that whole change occurred over what period of time, you would say?
Speaker 2: Quite a few years.
Speaker 1: It started in the '60s [1960s], right?  Do you think, or--
Speaker 2: I think it was very prevalent in the '60s [1960s], or that's where you had the onset of community control and more involvement of community, more clamoring on the part of community, that they wanna see changes made in the school system, and more--unfortunately, it might have been some situations where, as a lot of people of African American descent may not feel, too--they feel, too, that we're not--the persons of color are not as capable, you know?  Unfortunately, that have been the case, and so we have to make a case with regard to them so that they change their ways and means, or at least don't enunciate it, you know?  But it was a lot to overcome, especially in the '60s [1960s]; those were some rough days, you know.
Speaker 1: Now--and people fearing, also, for their jobs--
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --where they don't--I mean if you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, if you speak out, sure (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: Right, it was the only job that people had, and then if you're working substitute--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, no benefits, okay--like that, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, no benefits, right.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And you could be--easily be dismissed, you know?  "Sorry, we don't have anything for you today."  And "Call us" you know, "Don't call us, we'll call you," (Laughter) that kinda thing.
Story_ID: 179686
Speaker 1: When you became principal [at Frederick Douglass Intermediate School 10, New York, New York], how long did it take you to assemble your--you know, you, you talk about the, the wonderful team you assembled--
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --but how long did it take you to really assemble that team?  I mean when was the--you know, how much preparatory time did you have from the time that--was it a year, or did you have--
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't a year.
Speaker 1: Was it, was it about three--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I think I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --was it the end of the school year? (Simultaneous).
Speaker 2: --I think I was--may have been appointed--yeah, at the end of the school year--somethin' like June, or somethin' like that--for September.  And so I had, actually, the summer, and it was good because I was able to talk with the people; I knew them, I was able to talk to them and, as I said, thank goodness for people like Father [Irving] Anthony and others who were there.  Well, they had a lotta things together already; they knew what we were trying to do and they knew, surely, what, what, what I wanted to do, and basic, I wanted to do what was best for the school, and then doing--tryin' to do what's best for the school.  So, many times, I would say--or based--even based on the experience--much--multitude of experiences and great experience I have, that was theoretical and practical, I would say, "Now, this is what I can perceive to be the possibilities," and have to get feedback from them.  "What do you think of it?"  You know, and they'd give their feed in, et cetera.  And so we'd come to a conclusion of--a decision as to how it should be, and we would agree.
Story_ID: 179687
Speaker 1: But, [HM] Dr. [Lionel] McMurren, what were you wanting to accomplish with the school?
Speaker 2: Basically, I wanted to make sure we had a good running school, administratively and supervisorially, that we had a good instructional program, and a good means by which we could ensure that it was a good instructional program; we would--formal observations and informal observations and discussions, et cetera, with the teachers, et cetera--lesson planning and making your objectives and whatever, and feedback from the parents and youngsters, too, because we wanted to try to get a team together, and the team would include, and which we did include, many parents.  And we had a good response from parents, and whenever we had anything, we could count on, you know, like at least five or six parents who were officers or other, always coming, and they would--if we wanted a large group, we could have twenty or thirty or forty or fifty parents, you know, and the Parents' Association meetings, they had a large group out.  And so my objective was to get us a good working school where the youngsters would come out learning, the supers--or supervisors would supervise, the teachers would teach, and the youngsters will learn--that's it.
Speaker 1: Now, it's--the reason I'm asking this--even though you were coming home--I mean, I mean, reconfigured home, okay (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, right.
Speaker 1: Even though you were coming, you had, you know, been a guidance counselor there, and being an administrator, you know, you won't--you wouldn't have the same perspective, so what I'm asking is what did you find there, you know, from an administrative point, that needed to be sort of shored up, or from, you know, from a curriculum standpoint, that needed to be shored up?
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: You had committed--you had a committed group for the most part, right?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yes, right, yeah.  We--a lot that needed to be shored with regard to teachers and, and their teaching practices, of not evaluating basically their lesson, and not having the kind of supervision with regard to the kinda lessons that they were planning and implementing, you see.  So--and one other thing was a matter of handling of behavior because we thought it was so essential that we have youngsters who wanted to go their own way or do whatever they wanted to do that they became aware of what we're trying to do--what the school is all about, and what we expect of them, and what they should expect of themselves, just say so, to instill that pride in themselves and pride in the school, that's why we had the school song; we wanted to make sure we rejuvenated and, and sang regularly, and we had the Negro National Anthem that we sung just after the Star Spangled Banner.  So we tried to instill pride in there, and--so it was a matter of pulling everything together by finding out--wherever there were any weak links anywhere, we would try to shore them up.
Speaker 1: And the teachers--how did you go about getting them onboard, you know, with, you know, making them understand that this is a certain level and, you know, and this is what the expecta--how did you actually implement that?
Speaker 2: Well, we had faculty conferences on a regular basis, and we just really lay it out there and just--and communicated what, what were the expectations and, and basically had it all in writing because we had a teacher's handbook that we spelled out.  I still have a copy of a teacher's handbook; we spell out pretty much what's expected of them.  They can be formal inspection--formal observations and informal observations, and write-ups; they had to write it up and submit it, and they--that would be part of their record, you see?--their written observation signed by the teacher and the supervisor.  And this is part of what they would call their rating, as well.  So, we--and we found that the teachers were very responsive because, you know, what teacher's gonna say, "I'm not gonna do that" when you see as plain as day, this is in the best interests of the children--I mean it's all spelled out; this is what you should do, you know, like should you not teach?  Should you not find out how well the--you know, what means do you have for evaluating whether the teachers are learning?  Yes, you think you're doin' a good job teaching, but are the children learning?  Now, how do you tell that they're learning?  Now, you got tests, well that's one way, you know?  Plus--and then, when you got to talk with them as well, you got to evaluate for them, you have individual conferences with the, with the students.  You find their problems; you know where they refer them?  If you can't handle it, send 'em to the guidance counselor, you know, who will take over from there and talk with you--get back to you and even include you as they evaluate what must be done.  But that's how we did most of the, the work with the teachers.  And fortunately, I was able to recruit a number of the teachers myself 'cause I knew a number of teachers in the area, and many of them I just said, "I would like you to come over and, you know, we're starting a new school and I'd like you to come and be a teacher."  So I got a lotta teachers from that source who were very good teachers.
Story_ID: 179688
Speaker 1: (Singing) Douglass, oh Douglass, ever shall be, forever your school and my school, give her three times three, oh fellow, long may we cherish thee, faithful we'll be, Douglass, oh Douglass, for you and for me.
Speaker 2: (Clapping). (Laughter) Okay, that's nice. Okay.
Story_ID: 179689
Speaker 1: What other things--how long do you--well, how long do you think it took you to pull your team in place, you know, of those first--did it take two years, three years of the--to get it where you felt that it was like a well-oiled machine?
Speaker 2: Oh, you mean at the new school [Frederick Douglass Intermediate School 10, New York, New York], as principal?
Speaker 1: At the new school as principal, yes.
Speaker 2: Well, as I, you know--thought I mentioned, it didn't take long at all; as I said, we had a little preliminary work over the summer.  After I'd learned that I was going to be appointed as the first principal there, and with the kind of contact I had with Father [Irving] Anthony, with Mr. Robinson [ph.], Dr. [Hill] Brindle we had, and a few others were there--Mr. Graham--it was just a matter of following up.  So, then--it's just a matter of then--in the first few sessions that we had with the teachers, because we had preliminary sessions with them, conferences, before any official conference from the school, because the first days that they were to report, where there were no students.  We talked about what we were tryin' to do--what we wanted to do; we got out our teacher's handbook, had the input from the teachers so it wouldn't be just handed down.  "This is what we expect; we'd like your feedback, and then it'll be implemented accordingly."  Then we get--somebody says, "I think this, that and the other"--we'll take that into consideration.  But basically, we didn't really have any objections or any real suggestions because they thought that things were as they should be.  So that made us feel good because it--you know, when you put something out and say, "This is gonna be the teacher's handbook, these are our expectations for our school, these are the expectations for our students and teachers, et cetera, and you find very few people say, "I object to this or that," and they wholeheartedly basically endorse it, it makes you feel good because it means you've had a--done a good job in planning.  And of course you've gotten their input as you went along anyway, so they're just givin'--condoning what basically they knew was gonna take place or the proposition that was gonna be put forth.  So we had good results.
Speaker 1: So, really--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --when you, when you came out of the, the--you came out of the gate fine.
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  I thought it--I thought you had just said that it took some time, you know, to recruit some more of your own--the teachers, and--
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have any problem in recruiting teachers; as I said, I went and got some teachers that I recruited myself, and others were recruited by persons that were in--that we knew of, and--some of the administrators.  And as I said, we had a--more-or-less a staff that was transported from the old school, you see.  It was more important to try to see if, if maybe some of the teachers that we didn't want to have come along, you know; so that was--made it a little uncomfortable, or at least persuasive that maybe they could seek some other possibility because we knew maybe that they weren't good teachers, and we didn't want them to come along as extra baggage, so to speak, you know.  So I, I think we did that very well--didn't have any major problems.
Story_ID: 179690
Speaker 1: Now what other--what other things were you proud of that you accomplished in that--you know, your period of time there?
Speaker 2: At [Frederick] Douglass [Intermediate School 10, New York, New York]?
Speaker 1: At Douglass.
Speaker 2: Well, it engendered a lot of the school spirit with regard to the students.  The naming of the various areas in honor of those persons they could look forward to and look up to, and we had a number of people to come to visit our school that would inspire them and to give some substance to what they were about and how they got to be wherever they've got to be, or were, and if they happened to be Douglass graduates, it would be even more germane because they would know, you know, "You can achieve; I've achieved and I was a student there, and you, too, can achieve."  So, it was a good (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: And you were gaining attention, also.
Speaker 2: Attention?
Speaker 1: Yeah, you were gaining attention for the work (laughter) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: That's true, yes.  One area that I have in my notes--and that's good because one of, one of the accomplishments--well, first, I wanna just speak on--we had some good fortune, too, that down the street from us we had a realty company, Webb & Brooker [Inc. New York, New York], and what they did was to adopt our school, and just, it was--it was sensible (unclear) because [HM Eugene H.] Webb's wife and my wife at the time, were in the same club called the Carrots [ph.], and that's how I knew him; and he became interested in what we were doing.  He visited the school, saw the good things we were doing, so he helped adopt--well, he adopted the school.  And through his adoption of the school, he was--he was politically oriented, too; he got--well, before--he got [Former New York City] Mayor [John] Lindsay to come; we got some pictures of Mayor Lindsay--came to the school.  You know, on the first day of school, he came one day--the opening of school--[Former New York City] Mayor [Ed] Koch, et cetera.  He also got the secretary of state at the time, Cyrus Vance and his wife [Grace Elsie] Gay [Sloane], to come to the school; they were so impressed, and we honored them at that time.  They, at the time, invited student council down to Washington, D.C.--chartered a bus down there to see how congress operated, and compared it with student council.  So, that was--those are good things that came out of the school at the time.  We had a group--we had a, a, a good project that came about as a result of my having connection when I was with the board of--with the Methodist Camp Service; I was a--it was a camp sending agency, and there, we used to send youngsters to the Fresh Air Fund, along with a lot of camps, and I met a, a gentleman by the name of Albert [A.] Edwards, and he was a fellow Fresh Air Fund worker--
Story_ID: 179691
Speaker 1: As I became principal of the school [Frederick Douglass Intermediate School 10, New York, New York]--this was another good fortune, good factor that came out of the connection and relationship--he introduced me to a gentleman by the name of Walton [H.] Marshall who was a retired Mobil oil executive, and Mr. Marshall, Walton Marshall--his birthday is on the 17th; I keep contact with him, and I was gonna ask him exactly what the total amount of money was over the years, that what he did was to say--when I first met him and what Albert Edwards had introduced me for the purpose of saying--that he had an idea that he wanted to send youngsters from Harlem [New York, New York] to this school in Mayer, M-A-Y-E-R, Arizona; it's called the Orme School.  It cost $20,000 a year to attend the school, but he wanted to send at least one based on monies that he would raise, and he wanted us to select the youngster from my school.  So, for--that began, I think, about 1977.  And during that--from that period on, until even now, he's been sending one or two youngsters to the Orme School, at about $20,000--it's gone up now, but it's $20,000 a year; they could pay all of the expenses of transportation there--three times; that is at the beginning at Christmas time, and at the end of the year, to, to go--transportation, and all the tuition there.  And we have done this for--it's about twenty-six students over the years, but some years they have had two students that they have selected.  And what we would do is we have--the guidance counselors get the applications and consult with the parents, et cetera and what-not, and then out of it would emerge a recommendation of a student to be considered, and what--or a number of students to be considered, and then the whole group--and Jean [McMurren, McMurren's wife] was included in that in the time, especially when, when--oh, when I, when I left the school, I continued.  We only had youngsters coming from my school, and we would, say, maybe have five youngsters that might have been recommended, and then Mr. Marshall, along with maybe a representative from the Orme School, and a group here in the city, would select the final youngster for--would receive the scholarship--maybe one or two.  And then when I became deputy superintendent, I extended that to the entire district; so we used all of the junior high schools, and they all sent youngsters and we selected the best youngster--one or two.  And so over the--these years, it's come to about $2,040,000, that's--I just calculated about that.  Dr. Thelma Hamilton, who was the superintendent over at District Five--I got a letter from her a couple of years ago; she's retired now, but she was commenting because I've kept in contact with--even though we're not involved in the entities anymore, but they've been sending youngsters, and that came out of [Frederick] Douglass [Intermediate School 10, New York, New York] as well.  So, Douglass--we would have a yearly--and the dis--well, this was District Five; but that's--well, out of the school, we just had so many very positive things, and I recognize the youngsters who have achieved and gone on to high school and college, and they've come back to speak to the students, and it gives them inspiration because--that they can achieve, et cetera 'cause they once sat in the same seats, you know, that kinda thing.  So--and, and the teachers themselves have moved on the greater heights.  As I mentioned, one of the deans who came as a teacher and then we made him dean of students--one of the four or five deans--and he went on to become--get his doctorate, and then become chairman of the department, as I said, and in the final analysis, when I retired, he hired me as a deputy--as a adjunct associate professor; and Dr. [Hill] Brindle as well, and a few other people.  But we've had a lot of very positive things come out of the school over the, over the years.
Story_ID: 179692
Speaker 1: So now, with--when--how--talk about the process for you becoming deputy superintendent.
Speaker 2: That was just a process of appointment (laughter).  What happened is--what I--basic--when I say appointment, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Laughter) Well, I know you're appointed but I'm just (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I think they did--they did feel, they did feel that a lot of things were bein' accomplished in this school and, and so the superintendent at the time, Dr. Luther Seabrook just decided that I should become the deputy.
Speaker 1: And this is even after you've gone through this sort of difficult period, you know, with the budget cuts.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: That's what--Okay, that's what (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: He was at the helm at the time we had the budget cuts, too (laughter), 'cause I was very upset, you know, about all the people--in the district office and everywhere else.
Speaker 1: And then you became a-- (laughter).
Speaker 2: (Laughter) That's true.  This is what--I tell you, when--I think--the four years that I became deputy, and I think my wife [Jean McMurren] can testify on--attest to the fact that--I think there were four very good years for this district.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Now, can you just des--(simultaneous)
Speaker 2: I did adopt what was called Five Alive--Let's Bring Five Back Alive.  So, five--and I've got a number of select--I have some of--clippings here they say--and then from the Amsterdam News, from the Voice, and from the CSA Bulletin, and they're saying, "Five is alive;" they say, "Coordinated by Dr. Lionel McMurren and what-not; they did this, that and the other and they're showing"--and I'm always given the credit too, because the credit belongs to so many others; I just happen to be fortunate enough to be able to, to give them that kinda leadership and have that kinda response and have that kinda input that I got from them to make it successful with students and with parents, as well as with teachers, in the whole District Five.
Speaker 1: Now, in this--I want, I want you to describe the--what District Five--what it encompassed--how many, you know, what was--the number of schools that were in the district, and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had about, five intermediate junior high schools, and maybe about twelve or fourteen elementary schools.  Let's see, I'd have to look again; I'm sure there're about--I should have prepared myself to thinking that you might ask me some questions like that; I haven't gotten to that yet.  But I don't know--say, how many thousand of youngsters--how many thousands of youngsters that would include, but it's, it's all of--I got a picture there, a diagram of the whole of District Five, and includes primarily Central Harlem [New York, New York].
Story_ID: 179693
Speaker 1: And how many low-performing, how many high-performing--
Speaker 2: At the time?
Speaker 1: At the time.
Speaker 2: We had a few low-performing schools at the time; some mediocre to middle, and a couple, only a couple, very high-performing; I think, during that time, there was an increase in performance.  We have an article there that says that the schools have improved tremendously, as we have some--so it's reported in the newspaper; it's one of the articles that I have here.  So, it means that the things we were doing were pretty effective 'cause part of it was--part of my job as deputy superintendent was to help train the assistant principals and some of the principals, newly appointed principals, and there I used a lot of the material that I had gained from Fordham [University, Bronx, New York, New York], and a lot of material I had gained from the Council of Supervisors and Administrators [CSA] which I was very active in.  I was liaison person for the Manhattan borough for the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, which is a major supervisory organization for supervisors in the city of New York [New York]--school supervisors.  So--and--so, we had a--I had a format for helping to--well, train, instruct, assist assistant principals and principals--all supervisors--in how to administer a school, how to supervise a school, and become effective instructional administrators.  And it, it was very effective, both--one 'cause I, I'd been there and I had a lotta respect because they knew I'd been--whatever I'm talkin' about I've been there and I've done that, so--and they had respect for me, and so I was teaching academically and theoretically because I would go to the schools now.  And they, they would talk about various problems they would have and we'd talk about that, and then how to solve those problems within, within the group.  And then from that, I would also go and visit the school and see, on first hand, what was happening and how to deal with it, and how that person was trying to deal with it, et cetera, and it became effective.  So, we--I gained a lot of--the supervisors were happy, they were learning, and they were--felt good about their jobs, and they felt they knew what they were doing; and if they didn't know, they know where to--they knew where to come to for help.  So I think the district at that time, in the four years that I was there, I felt--I did feel very good because I felt I was bein' effective and had made a major contribution to, to the organization.
Story_ID: 179694
Speaker 1: It also sounds--'cause I--you know, one of the questions I was gonna ask you was did you miss sort of the hands-on approach, because you had been, you know, sort of hands-on within, you know, being a principal [at Frederick Douglass Intermediate School 10, New York, New York].  Even though you were bring other resources--
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --you know, and--and I was wondering if--you, you took it in another step; you were actually getting down in the, in the trenches, so to speak--
Speaker 2: Yes, sure.
Speaker 1: --and understanding (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Sure, I would go to the schools, too, and we'd talk and find out what was goin' on and work through whatever the situation was.
Speaker 1: You know, when you--back at [Frederick] Douglass [Intermediate School 10, New York, New York] just one second--when you had--when the gentleman adopted the, you know, the school, was that commonly being done at that time?
Speaker 2: No, we didn't have that--no, you're not--I can't think of--I'm sure--I think I remember somewhere somebody might have adopted a school, but here, this is a person who was right down the street and came--he was at our beck and call; if I said, "You know, Mr. [HM Eugene H.] Webb," you know, "Gene, could you come over to do--whatever?"  I didn't--he didn't have to wait for that; I--he, he, he didn't wait for that anyway; he would always call me up and say, "I've got the mayor that's comin' over to see me," or something--whatever, "I wanna bring him over to the school; can I?"  I said, "Are you askin' me?"  Of course, no question about it."  And he would bring the mayor right on.  And did that with [Former New York City] Mayor [John] Lindsay, did it with [former New York City] Mayor [Ed] Koch, and he set it up for the [former] secretary of state [Cyrus Vance]; he made arrangement accordingly.  And he's got an honorary doctorate, so I always call him Dr. Webb because I said he should be accorded that because of his--the fact he's important, and anyway--and he's earned that title.  So I'll call him and say, "Well, Dr. Webb,"--you know, he, he's, he's, he's down to earth and he's, he's a person that finds out what the basis of whatever it is, and he goes to it and, and gets whatever it is done.  And he's one of the reasons I put in, in my book, in the beginning acknowledgements to Dr. Webb because he rightfully read the riot act to me year before, like--last year, was it?  It's about a year, and he said, "I've been talkin' about this book for the longest time, you know, but I haven't seen it."  And he'll tell it just like it is--"I haven't seen anything.  I mean where is it?  Well, did you have the book signing?  Where is it?  I haven't seen it."  And so--and he--this is with an audience; I mean he's onstage (laughter) and he's tellin' me this.  I said, "Oh, my goodness.  Well, I deserve it," I said, "I deserve it.  True, I've been draggin' my feet; yes, I've been making excuses, I have to get this done first and I gotta do that, well I'm gonna get to that and I don't get to it, you're absolutely right, I should have had it done."  And so he says, "And one thing," he says, "I wanna make sure it's done because I know my name is gonna be in it and I'm gonna be figured prominently, and I'd like to read it before I die" (laughter).  I say, "Boy, that's quite a command," and I said, "I've gotta do it."   And that's why I been--I brought all this stuff up here, I'm glad I brought some of it up because I didn't know you were gonna (laughter)--that [HM] Reverend [Calvin O.] Pressley was gonna suggest my name and I--at least I have some material here; otherwise, I might not have anything.
Speaker 1: Well, [HM] Dr. [Lionel] McMurren, the reason I wanted to mention that, you know, make note of that, is because those programs have become popular now--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and they, you know--you know, with businesses adopting--or the focus on businesses adopting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: They should--adopting--many times they're just giving money, basically, or providing scholarships; but he does a lot more than that, you know?  He's involved with the youngsters and with the parents, et cetera.  And what I'd like to see and what they're trying to do a little more of is, is mentoring programs where they adopt a school; and part of it is--and part of our mentoring program where they work with the students, you know, in whatever areas are needed to be worked with.
Story_ID: 179695
Speaker 1: Has the legacy of [Frederick] Douglass [Intermediate School 10, New York, New York] continued today?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm glad you mention that because one other area--one other organization that--because we moved down to Florida, I have some regrets that--and I feel that maybe if I'd stayed in New York, I might have been--my wife [Jean McMurren] contests that--she says, "Well, you know, things sometimes are meant to be different."  I'm still emeritus in this and that, and advisor through Association of Black Educators of New York; they have me on, on the stationery.  But I feel that there're so many things that I, I might have proceeded--continued; there was one organization called the Frederick Douglass--just formed in 19--I think it was 1986, around--the Frederick Douglass Alumni Association, and this was one of the gentlemen, Orville Walker, who was one of the former students at Douglass, and he was associated with the [Harlem] Council of Elders and a few other groups we had, in volunteering his services, and he wanted to have a Frederick Douglass alumni association to do what is called Give Back to the Students--Give Back to Douglass, the things that were imparted to us, so that we could have a hand in mentoring and trying to make sure we brought along students who needed so desperately the help of persons.  Sometimes, they got it from their parents, etcetera, and other times--and from teachers, but other times they didn't.  So, it was a, a program that needed to be done.  Now, they--to answer your question, there was a couple others, the Harlem Council of Elders, a lot of noted--[HM] Dr. Muriel Petioni, I don't--'member her, and Chief Walker [ph.], and quite a few people--I have their names up there, are part of--I think that group right there--of the Council of Elders.  We were tryin' to do something similar to that on a global sense, as far as education in the entire community, in the organizations as well as the schools.  But a lot of that, I don't think is takin' place at this point in time, and that's what I regret.  When I hear about what's happening, especially in District Five--I've got a lady that sends me clippings of what's happening in District Five, and really makes my--she says, "I know this is gon' make your heart bleed, but I'm sure you wanna know, you know."  And with grades goin' down, failures here, this is--and things are not--just not goin' right.  He was a person who was a--the deputy superintendent, along with me; he became the deputy--he became the superintendent, but unfortunately, a lotta things happened, and, and--anyway, the school--the district sorta went down-hill, and I'm just very regretful at that.  And if more organizations and group--community groups and people become more interested and adopted a school, and the schools there, I think maybe they could have been saved.

Speaker 1: Do you think with the re-development of, of Harlem [New York, New York], that there's a chance for that?  It would take some time, you're saying.
Speaker 2: Well, I'm like [HM Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, I keep hope--keep hope alive (laughter). I feel that--I've heard so many good things about things happening in Harlem; I'm wondering what's happening with regard to the children.  And whether or not they're children as well, moving there.  I don't think--I haven't addressed that with anyone else who has talked about it.  Some--a number of people are very knowledgeable.  I wanna find out if these people--if they're just older people that are moving in, which I maybe get the--I get the thought; maybe I don't have any basis for it; I think they're older people whose children are grown, or who are moving in buyin' all of these places in Harlem now, like a--my church used to own a parsonage over on 139th Street [New York, New York] that probably was about $27,000, and now it can sell for $300,000, you know?  But I'm wondering if the children are moving in, too; I don't think so--maybe they are, and if so, where are they going to school?  If they can move in there and go to school down--up someplace else private, wherever--anyplace but the neighborhood school; and that would be my thought--that's what they would probably do.  And I guess maybe you cannot much blame them; they say, "I'm gonna live here now, but I want my kid or grand kid--some of the people have their grandchildren and they're takin' care of them now, but for whatever reason, they don't want their grandchildren going there, see?  So, if you can make a transformation of the schools there, at the same time that neighborhood's transforming, then there's hope for it and, and, and that will improve the schools because the people in the houses, the parents and community people, will demand, and they have to put the pressure on the people to make sure that things change.  If you don't have anybody--where, where there's no protest, there's no progress.
Story_ID: 179697
Speaker 1: So, it's--retirement.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Would you have retired had--would you have retired at this time that you did?
Speaker 2: Would I?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you had--retirement.  You want--you retired, right?
Speaker 2: Well, they told me--when I say "they", I was, I think I was led more by what my advisors, we'll call advisors, were giving me.  I was close to the Council of [School] Supervisors and Administrators [New York, New York], downtown people.  I knew just about all the people who were so-called, somebody in a sense in the board at the time, different people.  And I knew a lot of--I was, had a good thread of connection with a lot of people.  But anyway, with regard to deciding retirement, I said, now, it was '86 [1986] and I'm eligible for retirement, and I wonder whether I should.  And I was told they can work it out on paper, and they said, "Lionel, if you work one more day beyond this day of your eligible retirement, you're working for nothing."  That's what he told me, black and white.  And he showed it to me, see, and, and said, "That's without social security," and said, "That's at sixty-two.  And you can retire and get your social security at sixty-two or you can work and wait till sixty-five too, and you'll get more money at sixty-five, but think how much money you're accumulating if you live to be sixty-five," (laughter).  I mean they were telling me just like it is.  And so I said, well, I may as well retire 'cause I can always get another job somewhere, doing something after retirement.  All these things, possibilities, community, people that I know, I can get a job here.  But anyway, that's why I retired, not knowing that years later, like now, for instance, my retirement was tied in with the stock market, see, got variable annuity, et cetera, but not "A" and "B".  Some part is fixed, some part, it varies with the stock market.  So around in 1987, '88 [1988], '89 [1989], '90 [1990], '91 [1991], '92 [1992], '93 [1993], going up the line, stock markets zoomed.  My check, compared to the others who had fixed, I'm getting like a thousand, two thousand or more, more per month than they are, see.  Great.  But at this point in time, the cost of living's going up, the stock market's going down (laughter).  And all of those things are happening, see, and no cost-of-living raise, you see.  And so, almost--as a lot of my colleagues have said, they're going back to work, some of them did, you know.  I got an offer about, what's it, four years ago, three years ago, four years now, I think.  He said, "Lionel," he says, "You got the political scene all set up.  You don't have any problems," 'cause that's important.  "We got a job for you and you don't have--you know, walk in, if you accept, you can walk right in, you know, as superintendent."  And you know how much superintendents are making now?  You know, he started telling me, "Yeah, about five times as much as you made as a principal, you're making now, you know, six figures and all.  Will you take it?"  And I said, "Thank you so much for that offer.  It's just wonderful of you, but based on what I hear, and I may be wrong, what's going on in the schools nowadays, I think I'd like to live a little longer," (laughter).  So I, I didn't accept.  But when you look back at it, you know, and, as I look now, sometimes I look at my--now, my salary pension is going up a little bit.  I lost about a thousand dollars a month in the last year or so, you know.  So, and the cost of living, you know, it's, everything come up, and they have an affair and charging seventy-five dollars a person for the affair (laughter), you know, for affairs that I used to go to was at least twenty dollars, you know what I mean.  That was big money, you see.
Story_ID: 179698
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you about, you know, your life out--you know, after retirement--
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and, you know, the things that you sort of, you know, found--you taught, you were an adjunct professor--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --you know, you--you got very involved; you were even saying that, you know, you had your--you know, you were involved with lots of active--duties--I mean groups--groups and organizations--
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and you were a tea--were you teaching two days a week?  Was that--or one?
Speaker 2: I think it was about two or three days a week, yes.  But I was working with [HM] Dr. [Beny J.] Primm, you just spoke with; he's been--we've been close for years; but he's--he's the director of--the executive director of Addiction Research Treatment Corporation-ARTC [later, START Treatment and Recovery Centers, New York, New York] a human resources institute; and so for a period of time I was co-chair of, of one of the groups he had there, and in the school one time we had the PEDAP Program--Prevention, Education, Addiction--Drug Addiction Program--PEDAP--but, and I worked with the--well, I did a lotta work with the church, as I--you may see there; I went from the time I was student to Sunday school, and superintendent of Sunday school, and went on straight up to superintendent of the church school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: St. Mark's [United Methodist Church, New York, New York].
Speaker 2: St. Mark's, and then chairman of the stewardship and finance committee, and the board of trustees, and administrative board, and all of those; and I stayed close with those organizations even after retirement.
Speaker 1: So you were there when--at--I mean in some form, when [HM] Reverend [Calvin O.] Pressley was there, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, basically (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay, for a short--he was a short-term reverend (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --he was just interim principal--interim--yeah, pastor.
Speaker 1: Right, right.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I went through--well, a long time in, I guess in '37 [1937].
Story_ID: 179699
Speaker 1: So, what does the--what does-[HM] Dr. [Lionel] McMurren, what do you want?  I know that you wanna finish your book.
Speaker 2: That's very important.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Is there anything else that you, you know, wanna do?
Speaker 2: Well, I wanna be a--continue to be a good husband to my wife [Jean McMurren] (laughter); I gotta get that in.  I wanna be a good father--continue to be a good father to my children, and a, a grandfather to my grandchildren--now, between us we have five children and seven grandchildren now, so that's part of life as well.  So, that's what I want to do.  I'm always interested in bridge, and that's one of my past-times and we've got a bridge club in social--in Sarasota [Florida] and one here [Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts] as well, and I'm happy to be able to be starting a little class with a couple of people who have now become interested in bridge, and so I like that.  I haven't played as much tennis as I used to; I used to play with [HM] Reverend [Calvin O.] Pressley and Senator [HM H.] Carl McCall, the [New York state] comptroller now--and a few other people here; but still, I play tennis with--in Sarasota we have a group comes out every Wednesday and Saturday and we play, and that's good part of retirement.  I like to--whatever ambitions I had, which I, I don't know if I'll ever realize, is--I have a number of books here, and a number of books down in Sarasota.  I said, "When I retire, I'm gonna read all these great books that I have just time to skim through before."  And then I would like to be able to read the paper, maybe the New York Times, all the way through each day, you know, without putting it aside because I find I gotta do this first; I'll say, "Let me do that first and the other," and I'll skim through or whatever, or I see a backlog of papers 'cause I'll start savin' the papers because I look and I'll say, "I don't have time to read this," so I'll tear it out and put it on the side.  "I don't have time to read this, so I'll tear this;" then that piles up on the side, and so I'd like to be able to read a lot of things that are very wonderful (unclear).  They got a book club here; we had a lunch at The Cornerway--Cornerway Restaurant; it's Jamaican-owned, Cornerway, and they got a book club there, and they read a book, I guess, and then they report on it or talk about it and discuss it on a regular basis.  I'd like to be able to do something like that, too, but more-so I'd like to be able--have time--take the time to read.  But I find it's, it's my own fault, all of it; I've just not apportioned the time for that because there so many things to do.  I got so many things just to do around this house, and then in Sarasota there's a lotta things to do around the house, and then outside; and I'm in part of a number of organizations there.  And the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] is one part.
Story_ID: 179700
Speaker 1: Can you talk about--just real quickly about your, you know, the Boule [Sigma Pi Phi Fraternity] and how--how long have you been a member?
Speaker 2: Let's see, I was just a member since about 1995 or '96 [1996].  I have--a gentleman who I met years ago, he and his wife used to play bridge with my former wife [Dorothy McMurren], and this was in New York [New York], and he was a Boule member when I moved down to Sarasota [Florida], so he sponsored me for the Boule.  As soon as I got in the Boule, about a couple of months they made me chairman of the program committee, and there I was able to get Vicky Olden [ph.], who was prominent on television and, and a couple other people who--let's see, Jim and--
Speaker 1: JEAN MCMURREN:  James.
Speaker 2: Yeah, Ed--Dr. Ed James--E. James; I got them to come to speak to the Boule, you know, about the community, et cetera, et cetera.  So I was doin' very well, then they decided they wanted to make me grammateus--that's a high-powered executive secretary; and I never worked so hard and so long and in so many things and--since I was working and earning money from working, but that was a big job.  Now, [HM Reverend] Calvin [O.] Pressley, Reverend Calvin Pressley, was once a grand grammateus of--now, he's the grand archon, but he was a grand grammateus.  But everything ordinarily went through the grammateus, and he have to work more than the so-called president of--the sire archon, and so I found myself--for five years or more, I was down there working, you know, just like I had a job.  You know, it was so much to do, you know, along with the other things that we're trying to do to enjoy ourselves.  But that's--that was an activity, and so many different activities there.
Story_ID: 179701
Speaker 1: I wanna ask you just a few more questions.  One, can you describe your, your love for Harlem [New York, New York]?
Speaker 2: Love for Harlem.  Hmm--well, outside of born--bein' born in Harlem Hospital [Center, New York, New York], and felt that all of the things that I enjoyed in my early years and later years, including one, the Savoy [Ballroom] (laughter), growing up in Harlem with the, the people that I knew, met, and became closely associated with, all of the culture that I find that made me proud of who I am and, and what I am, people who have made an impression in Harlem and made me feel close to Harlem, as such, and identified with Harlem; and the schools and the churches, 'cause not only in St. Mark's United Methodist Church [New York, New York], I was close to, as we grew up I--we used to play basketball and we played against Abyssinia Baptist Church [New York, New York] and St. Philips [Church, New York, New York].  And as we grew up, there were so many people that--and we still have connection with--say, part of the 30-Year Friends, all of them have centers in Harlem; either Uptown, Downtown; even many gangs, which I mention in the book, they had so many different gangs--the Slicksters, and the Uptowners and the Downtowners and the Buccaneers and the Comanches, and the--all kinds of groups.  But still, they made up the character of Harlem.  It used to be, and they say, that people of dispute thought that when Mr. [Robert S.] Dixon took the group over there to form [Frederick] Douglass [Junior High School, New York, New York] in 1924, across the street were canopied houses where each one of them had a doorman, you see, and that was, at that time, in 1924--139th Street--had canopies, you know, with doormen--that way--where the cars would drive up, the doormen would open the door for them and they step out and go into the apartment.  But, I just feel that I'm just enamored about Harlem because it was my home, and I still regard it very closely.
Speaker 1: Now, I want you to finish this statement, "When I look in a child's eyes, I see"--
Speaker 2: When I look in a child's eyes I see?  Well, I might say hope for the future--I'd like to see in a child's eye some gleam that will spark progress in thinking and achievement; that's academically what I would be--how I would respond to that, in a sense of that's what I'd like to see in a child's eye.
Speaker 1: And what about--and how would you define a good educator?
Speaker 2: A good educator?  Good educator might be one who is a good listener, a good learner, and a good theorist--can see what needs to be practiced and put it into effect--benefits from his or her mistakes, capitalizes on the positives, and as much as possible and diminuates [ph.] the negatives and tries to promote love--love in the sense of love for neighbor, love for learning, and respect for one another; and to generate that by example.
Story_ID: 179702
Speaker 1: And [HM] Dr. [Lionel] McMurren, what do you want your legacy to be?  And I ask this question and ask you to think about the child that was, you know, in the apartment building who saw the little--the guy being roughed up and was frightened--
Speaker 2: Umm-hmm.
Speaker 1: --and the child who Amatrotta [sic, McMurren's sixth grade teacher, Mr. Amatrano], you know, influenced and saw something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Almost what?
Speaker 1: Amatrot--is it (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Oh, Amatrano?
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--'trano, okay (laughter).  And the person who followed his, you know, father's [Noah Edison McMurren] dream of becoming an educator and went on to give back to the school that he did.  I want you to consider those things, but I'd like you to, to answer what you want your legacy to be.
Speaker 2: When you say my legacy, what I'd leave for people to--like people to probably say that here's a man that dreamed dreams and tried to make those dreams come true by positive actions in the things he's did--that he did.  So--there lies also the hope for the future because, as you perhaps try to think of what impression you've made or what legacy you've left, you want that to be an inspiration for those who come after you, and I think that may be all I can say.
Story_ID: 179703
Speaker 1: Okay.  And can we have one of your favorite poems?  Short--a short stan--I mean but can we have one of your favorite poems?
Speaker 2: Well, like 'Invictus' [William Ernest Henley], or you mean--one that--not one I've (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: I don't care; one that you wrote.  You were writing--you were penning poems.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, I was--this is--the one--I, 'Invictus' I already--
Speaker 1: Right--said a little bit (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the one, 'Invictus,' you sort of ran through, but go on.  You did--you said the last few lines, but I (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: You want me to recite the 'Invictus'?  I can.  "Out of the night that covers me, black as a pit from pole to pole, I thank whatever gods may be for my unconquerable soul.  In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud, and under the bludgeonings of chance my head is bloody, but unbound.  Beyond this place of wrath and tears looms but the horror of the shade, and yet the menace of the years finds, and shall find me, unafraid.  It matters not how strait the gate, or how charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate; I am captain of my soul."  John [sic, William] Ernest Henley--'Invictus'.
Speaker 1: Thank you.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 179704
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, tell us about this photo.
Speaker 2: That photo is a--taken of me as a child in a carriage of one year--and I was one years of--of age--one year of age.  So, I wouldn't ordinarily know, except my--that's what my father [Noah Edison McMurren] told me (laughter).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is as a youngster in knickerbockers and knickerbockers is what we wore in those days when I graduated from junior high school [at Frederick Douglass Junior High School, New York New York]; all the youngsters wore knickerbockers with argyle socks.
Speaker 1: And the next picture here shows when--taken on the roof; my father probably took this picture because every time they wanted to take a picture, they went on the roof, I don't know why.
Speaker 2: Do you know what age you were at this time?
Speaker 1: I was probably about thirteen, fourteen.
Speaker 2: And this was when I was in the service; I may have come home, and so that's in 1944--probably.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  On the roof?
Speaker 2: On the roof.
Speaker 1: Those are--are they the same?  No, it looks sort of like, but it's not.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: The one you're showing now is just--just happened to be a random shot that I put, and that was--I musta been about--maybe about sixty, fifty-five or sixty, if I was that old.

Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Okay.  I'm gonna--
Speaker 1: Here, we--Okay, here we have a picture of former [New York] mayor, John Lindsay; he's--we're having some tet-a-tet, and the gentleman on the left, my left, is Calvin Austin who, at the time, was president of the Community School Board, and was a former student at Douglass, and he rose and became president of the Community School Board.  That's Calvin Austin.

The top line, we have Bill Smith, the other--next person I know is at the--clear at the end on the top right, is Dr. Roycie [ph.] Phillips.  Just before him is Warren Morrison.  Down the lower level, the first person is Ed Levy; he's just passed a couple years ago, then we have Louis Hughes; he's been incapacitated.  He lives down in Sarasota [Florida] and he's basically in a wheel chair.  The person in the center, number eight, is myself holdin' the ball.  And the next person on, on, on the right, as we go from left to right, his name is Gene Esquarey [ph.], and he is--he was once president of the Tuskegee Airmen; he became a Tuskegee Airman, and became president of the organization.

Speaker 1: That's a picture--the next one is myself and my oldest son, Gene McMurren, and my father, before he died, Noah McMurren.
Speaker 2: The next one is--this picture is one taken of my father, who was a good boxer, and he tried to teach me how to box as well, and I did so; I think I defended myself pretty well, but I tried to get in as few fights as I could. So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--His name is Noah E. McMurren, as I said before.

Speaker 2: About 1990.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of our entire staff of junior high school or I--[Frederick Douglass] Intermediate School 10 [New York, New York], in the auditorium, with all my assistant principals in the front, sitting along with myself as chairman of departments, and the rest of the staff there at the time--that's at IS [Intermediate School] 10; it's a auditorium.
Speaker 2: And what, what year?
Speaker 1: That was probably in 1972.

Speaker 1: The bottom center, we have Congressman [HM the Honorable] Charles [B.] Rangel who is, as I've indicated before, a graduate of Frederick Douglass Junior High School 139 [New York, New York], along with Fred Woodruff, the next person there, and Dr. Luther Seabrook, who was the superintendent.  Then, we have another; I can't make her out--no, that's Mercedes Nesfield, and she was quite prominent in the [New York] Board of Education, and Dr. James Boffman, who became superintendent of schools for the whole of Manhattan--of high schools for the whole of Manhattan.  And lastly, myself there on the extreme right.

The other one is Dr. Andrew Donaldson, who was quite an educator and became community school district superintendent of District Six [New York, New York] in the 1960s, and the other one is Father Irving Anthony that we've spoken about so often--a dynamic person who was the rector of St. Philips [Church, Harlem, New York, New York] at the time, as well, and also my right-hand person as administrative assistant when I first started the, the new Douglass in the IS 10.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  What others should we do?
Speaker 2: Let's see, maybe lower right; I can remember all of the names.  I can--I can move, can't I 'cause I'm not--yeah.  Okay, okay, okay, we have--in this photograph we got some pretty famous people.  This is the Harlem Council of Elders, as we had it formed to try to do what we could to improve the conditions of Harlem and work with the different organizations and schools in Harlem, and among them were Professor Preston Wilcox; he's up from Columbia University [New York, New York], the next is myself, Dr. Lionel McMurren, and then the next person there is Judge Bruce Wright; they used to call him Bruce 'Turn-Him-Loose' Wright because he was--believed in givin' a break to a lotta prisoners who really deserved a break, so they got the connage of--coinage of 'Turn-Him-Loose' Bruce; that's Bruce Wright.  The next person is Marie Runyon who was quite active in the community; then, Attorney Galen [D.] Kirkland who organized the Harlem Council of Elders.  The next person there is a very important person in the Harlem community, [HM] Dr. Muriel Petioni; and likewise, a great dentist in the Harlem community, Dr. R. Chester Redhead.  Then, we have a gentleman whose life was too short; he was gonna be, or he was the president of the Frederick Douglass Alumni Association and quite a mover and a shaker, but he died at an early age in 1966, and that's Orville Walker; we called him Ollie Walker.  And lastly, we have JoAnne McCaster, who was the secretary for the organization of the council.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Any others on there?
Speaker 2: Yes, right here.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: That middle photo is myself, Lionel McMurren; the next person is the famous Dr. Kenneth Clark, who's a graduate of Douglass and a great psychologist, who was a person--prime mover in the Brown versus the Board of Education [of Topeka, 1954] that proved that separate is not equal in the school system.  The next person is a person who followed me as principal of Frederick Douglass Intermediate School 10, David Bluford, and the last person on the right is a famous person in the Harlem community; his name is Arlington 'Ollie' Edinboro; he was famous in recreation, and did so much for the Harlem community.
Speaker 1: If you'll pass over to the next picture on the right, you'll see Dr. Eugene Webb who adopted the school, IS 10; he was the president and CEO of Webb & Brooker Realty [Inc., New York, New York].  The next person is Norel James who also succeeded--who succeeded David Bluford as principal of IS 10; and then Ollie Walker, of whom I spoke before.  Wynola Glenn is the next person; she was the president of the Community School Board, and then lastly, myself.
Speaker 2: You might wanna focus on--well, this one first?  That's two students, former students of Douglass, who are greeting another former and famous student of Douglass, who's Brock Peters, and we had the good fortune of having Brock Peters teachin' a person who inspired him in English, and her name was Mrs. Mildred Fisher.
Speaker 1: Over here on the right, we see what we call the October Boys, and most of these people were young people, young at the time, have achieved.  Van Turner--I think he went to the Board of Education, became active in community education.  The next person is Dr. Beny Prim, who is now executive director of Addiction Research and Treatment Corporation [ARTC, later START Treatment and Recovery Centers, New York, New York]; Lionel McMurren; the next one is Livingston Dougan who is in a nursing home at this time.  Robert Clarke, who is a noted scientist who is--lives still in the Bronx.  Jerome Prim is Dr. Beny Prim's brother; he was a funeral director and he just passed away in October of this past year.  And another one is Dr. Alexander Jordan, who is one of my best friends as well; he became a physician; he's a graduate of Douglass as well, and Bill Jarratt.  Now, all of these gentlemen were born in October, and we used to celebrate every October--their birthdays.
Speaker 2: This one over here in extreme left--you've heard us refer to the 30-Year Friends.  I won't attempt to name all of them here, but they have been in existence--they all came out and went to DeWitt Clinton High School [Bronx, New York, New York], and from that formed a relationship of the 30-Year Friends, and a few years later, they had the joke about the fact that we're the 30-Year Friends because they said we've been together so long we should re-name the group the 60-Year Friends.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Here, we have a picture of renowned, famous Father Irving Anthony; next to him is a person who was a student when he was a teacher at Douglass--Brock Peters, who became a famous actor, as you know.  His real name is actually Theodore Fisher, and his teacher is Mrs. Mildred Fisher, and she came back to the school just for that occasion.  We named the auditorium in his honor, the Brock Peters Auditorium.
Speaker 1: Okay, this is a meeting of--
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: This is the occasion of the visit of a few members of our Community School Board and other activists in the community.  On the far left, we see Calvin Austin who was a former student at Douglass who became the chairman of the board of the Community School Board.  The next lady I have to remember, and I--unfortunately, I have to skip over her name at this time to introduce the next person who is Mr. Olvin McBarnett, who became superintendent of Community School District Five.  The next person standing is myself, Lionel McMurren, and right under me pictured here is a very distinguished gentleman who was in the Tuskegee--acted with the Tuskegee Airmen, and I've gotta remember--I should have him right now, but that's part of--sometimes my old age, not remembering people that I should remember.  The other person is Ed Jeffries who is right at the end; Edward Jeffries is a former student here, a student at Douglass, and he went on to become a teacher at Douglass.
Speaker 2: We're almost down to the (unclear).
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: These are clippings that were taken from the newspaper--Amsterdam News in one case, the Voice in another, and also the District Newspaper.  Primarily, the one in the extreme upper left-hand corner is an article that is indicating the importance of, of school, a Harlem School getting, as they say, real, and real, in this case, realty help from Webb & Brooker, that was a realty agency, and they was right down the street from the school, and they assisted and adopted the school and brought so many benefits to the school as a result of their interest accordingly.
Speaker 1: These next articles have to do with District Five coming alive, as a result of its Come Alive Program, which was primarily coordinated by Dr. Lionel McMurren, with the assistance of so many capable persons who gave substance to the program, and to whom he is ever grateful, and this was under the leadership of Dr. Luther W. Seabrook and Dr. Bertram Brown who was a deputy superintendent, along with Dr. McMurren.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And lastly, you have a report from the--to the community from the, from the District Newspaper that indicates for sure that School District Five is alive in Harlem, and they want everybody to know it, and they want you to find a community school board and they listed four people to read.
Story_ID: 179706
Speaker 1: All right.  On the extreme left up at the top, we have a picture of Tony Brown; you're familiar with Tony Brown because he's got Tony Brown's Journal, and I know you may--that brings some recollection to your mind.  In the middle is Reverend Robert Smith, who was pastor of St. Mark's United Methodist Church [New York, New York] at the time, and then myself.  I think this was taken maybe sometime in about 1980.
Speaker 2: And right on to the right, just to the right of that picture, you'll see an astronaut; you remember Ronald McNair, the famous astronaut--black astronaut?  There weren't too many, so he's one that you surely should remember.  And of course, captured in that same picture is a councilman, Fred Samuel, and none other than my namesake, Lionel Hampton, who was there.  You have Richard Ware, who's a son of a--a president of our Parent's Association--was in his uniform there.
Speaker 1: Just below that, I want to point out--right over here, is a very distinguished person who happened to have been my colleague at Brooklyn College, and she returned to the school and she became a congresswoman; and that's Congresswoman Shirley Chisolm.
Speaker 2: We didn't--well, we didn't want--those are hard to, to capture.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They're not good photos.
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Top left?
Speaker 2: Top left here you see--and I was fortunate enough to be able to have a photograph with someone who visited us, and that is [HM] Vernon Jordan; now everyone knows that name, Vernon Jordan, so I was very happy to be able to be with him.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Which one?
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Top right.
Speaker 2: The top right is a picture of me and--when I was just beginnin' to lose my hair, but I still like it because it--I wish I were still the same.
Speaker 1: And the one below that where you see the definitive loss of hair; that's me with my darling wife Jean [McMurren].
Speaker 2: And lower, lower right here, is just the front page of the United--St. Mark's United Methodist Church's bulletin when they were celebrating Dr. Lionel E. McMurren Day on September 21st, 1980; it was shortly after I had just received my Doctor of Philosophy degree, Ph.D., and they celebrated because I had been in the church and been active through the years in participating, and that was a glorious day that day.
Speaker 1: This top right picture is taken from a big red country; I believe it was the same issue--that was in February--I'm sorry, it was May the 31st of 1986, and this is a scene from--in an article showing my retirement, which was in May of 1986.
Speaker 2: And there we have the president of, of the--of--for many years, of IS [Intermediate School] 10 Association--of, of Frederick Douglass Intermediate School 10 [New York, New York], and Mr. Joseph Sellers who was a, a colleague, who was principal of Public School 200, and myself receiving the award.
Speaker 1: (Laughter)--Dr. McMurren, you weren't supposed to do that (laughter).
Speaker 2: What's that?  I wasn't supposed to do what?
Speaker 1: Oh, I had given you one (laughter); this one right here.
Speaker 2: Oh, okay.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--(Laughter)--Okay.  I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Jean, you're gonna have to help me with all of these.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: Okay, this is the latest granddaughter, addition to the family; her name is Raven Stanet, S-T-A-N-E-T, and she's just looking real wild-eyed, but she's a doll.  She was--so we had the pleasure of having her here for a few days.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA DISCUSSION)
Speaker 2: She's three months of age, and growing.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  And what do we have here?
Speaker 2: Here, we have Dylan Stanet, that's the brother of Raven, and he was visiting here as well; he's a little over two--two and a half, and he's one that--we have to anchor everything down because he's quite a mover; we hope that he'll grow up to be a mover and a shaker.
