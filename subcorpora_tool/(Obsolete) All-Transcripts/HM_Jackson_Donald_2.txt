Speaker 1: What is your favorite food?
Speaker 2: I have no favorite food (laughs).  I happen to be one of these people that eat to live.  And not live to eat.  So I have just anything that--that keeps you going in that pyramid of--you know, of foods. You know, the proteins, the carbohydrates and all that kind of stuff.  All of 'em are okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  Okay.  Do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: I would say blue.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Do you have a favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: Mountains.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Wherever there's mountains.
Speaker 2: (nods for yes) Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: No. There was a couple that my mother left me with that I use occasionally.  But I wouldn't say that they are, you know, particularly favorites.  One of those was, "He fasted--he travels fastest who travels alone" was one.  That's the one I could think of right off.
Story_ID: 8797
Speaker 1: Let's talk about your beginnings and your family.  And can you give us the names of your parents?  And spell them for us please?
Speaker 2: My father was Roy Jackson, "R-O-Y J-A-C-K-S-O-N".  And my mother was Viola Mae Jackson, "V-I-O-L-A".  And the middle was "M-A-E" and "J-A-C-K-S-O-N".
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now if you're looking at me funny, because you--It was a Jackson that married a Jackson.  So I kept the family name.  You know, rather than take, you know, name otherwise.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Double Jackson--.
Speaker 2: Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah. All right.
Speaker 1: Well when was Viola Jackson--?
Speaker 2: When was she born?  Woo.  I think it was something like about 1895 or something like that.
Speaker 1: And where was she born?
Speaker 2: She was born in Lexington, Kentucky.
Speaker 1: Okay. And where was Roy Jackson born?
Speaker 2: I believe he was born in Texas.  But I'm not sure.  He lived--he--there was something about Chetopa, "C-H-E-T-O-P-A" Kansas in his life that he lived there.  He might have been--that might have been where he was reared.  But he died in--at least when he died he had been working in Pittsburg, Kansas.  And that's where my mother was as well. She graduated from Pittsburg State [University, Pittsburg, Kansas] with a degree in education and history.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what year was your father born?
Speaker 2: That I don't know either.
Speaker 1: Okay.  You have a guess that you might make?
Speaker 2: I would suspect about that same time.  He might been one or two years older than she was. I--.
Speaker 1: 1891, '92 [1892], '93 [1893]?
Speaker 2: It could be.  I know he was in the First World War.  Because I have pictures of he and mom at--Fort Riley [Kansas].
Speaker 1: Fort Riley, Kansas?
Speaker 2: I can't think Camp Funston [at Fort Riley, Kansas]. I believe is the location of that picture.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now did they impart a story to you about how they met?
Speaker 2: No, they didn't.
Speaker 1: So you don't know any--have any idea how they met?
Speaker 2: No, I don't. As I--They were--they were divorced when I was very young. Before I really was age of consciousness really.  And so I was a--mom was a single parent with my sister and I until I was in about the sixth grade, at which time a auntie and her husband came to the family house.  That was a safe house.  And to look after their mother--my grandmother [Delilah Jackson] at her old age.  And I lived with them for the rest of, you know, my high school education time.
Story_ID: 8798
Speaker 1: I wanna go back some to talk about your ancestors.  Do you have any knowledge of your grandparents or your--or any of your ancestors going back to slavery days or Reconstruction or the migration period?
Speaker 2: My grandfather who was--he was a light-skinned Kentucky too, of course. And he was a dairy farmer.  And as I understand it, he died suddenly from--with a heart condition.  And I don't know how long after his death, grandmother [Delilah Jackson] came to Kansas City, Kansas on the recommendation of her older son, whose name was Robert Jackson, with five of her daughters.  And, you know, set up house keeping there.  They were directed toward Kansas City, Kansas because Robert was a professor of music out at--oh the school in Quindaro.  I'm trying to think of the name of--Western University [Quindaro, Kansas, now part of Kansas City, Kansas].  Have you heard of Western University?  Yeah. Western University was the name of it.  It was a AME [African Methodist Episcopal] affiliated college at Quindaro [Kansas].  And that's where he was professor of music, and he urged grandmother to come to Kansas.  And I--I'm sure it was during that exoduster time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So this is--we're talking about during the 1870s or--?
Speaker 2: Well if--no.  It would have been--maybe I got the exoduster time wrong.  Because if Mom [Viola Jackson] was born about 1895, and my grandmother came to Kansas, and they were pretty near high school or junior high school age.  Maybe they were pretty close to age. So it must have been some place in the early 1900s.
Speaker 1: Say around the turn of the century?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I might be a little fuzzy on that time too.  Because grandmother--I mean my mother did marry my father [Roy Jackson] in the First World War, which was 1914 to '17 [1917, sic, 1918].  So it--I need a pencil and paper to figure it (laughs).
Speaker 1: We have a general sense of it--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: People thinking about it. Yeah. But people making that migration, you know--all through the nineteenth century and the earlier part of the twentieth century.  So--did your mother's family have any stories about slavery or the Civil War or any of that? Out of Lexington [Kentucky]?
Speaker 2: I never heard any. And that would be probably in the generation before them.  But I'm not sure about that either.  And I should be more sure about it, because we have family reunions.  And we have one member of our--of our family who is a first cousin of mine who has compiled a pretty complete and serious, you know, account of the family members.
Speaker 1: What--what's his name?  And what's the name of the book that--?
Speaker 2: His name is Thaddeus Jackson, and he lives in Chicago, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And is there a name for his book?
Speaker 2: No. This is just a--just a family--just family stuff.
Speaker 1: Okay. Thaddeus Jackson in Chicago?  All right.  Well what about your father's?  Do you know much about your father's side?
Speaker 2: Don't know much about them at all.  He had some brothers that lived--or a brother anyhow that lived in Kansas City, Missouri where he went, you know, when he became terminally ill.  And one of his nieces, I believe was a teacher--Sumner High School in Kansas City, Kansas.  She was a teacher of mine.  So I ran into, you know, her more than I did the rest of his family.
Story_ID: 8799
Speaker 1: I think your first memories are of Prairie View [Texas].  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Prairie View, Texas.
Speaker 2: That's where Mother [Viola Jackson] went during the [Great] Depression, because, you know, she was a--was a teacher. And I understand now that there was a little networking involved of, you know, hiring teachers--black teachers probably in black institutions.  You know, during that hard period of time.  And things got even harder.  And after Mom was there  she was in charge of the cafeteria.  They, you know, cut down--or cut back some more.  And Mom sent my sister, whose name was Doryce, "D-O-R-Y-C-E" back to Kansas City, Kansas, and she and I went to a place that I think was probably a sharecropper place.  The name was Steel Store.  I have known a few Texans and I have sent a few of these people down to look for Steel Store, Texas [in Brazos County, Texas], and nobody has ever been able to find it.  So I think that it probably was, like I said, just a sharecropper location.  And I remember we'd--you know, going down this, what seemed like a long dirt road.  And you would--then there's this big store, you know, would be there.  And when you turn to the right, you would go down, you know, not--on a street that was our road that, you know, all the black people lived on.  And if you go to the left, you would go by the, you know, the owner's home.  And my mother and I stayed with the cook.  And so we went down the--the left side.  And Mom was there just one year teaching at a one-room schoolhouse that had grades up to eighth.  And she was my teacher when I was in the fourth grade.  She kept a strap curled on the edge of her desk.  And so I was a good boy in the fourth grade.  And she left Steel Store after one year because she would say--she said that I was becoming too much, you know, like the people there on the--you know, on that plantation--sharecropper, you know, type of place.  It was a sacrifice that I have only learned to appreciate, you know, as I have gotten older.  And I appreciate it more, the older I get.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Came back to Kansas City, Kansas at that time.  And I went to Stowe [Elementary] School in Kansas City, Kansas from the fifth grade.
Speaker 1: "S-T-O-W-E"?
Speaker 2: "S-T-O-W-E".  And then from there to Northeast Junior High School [Kansas City, Kansas] like all other black people did, including the people that, you know, lived in the very far corners of Kansas City, Kansas. You know, Rosedale [Kansas] and, you know, places like that around the packing house. They, you know, were bussed as it was.  They were given transportation, and they had to come into the northeast section where the, you know, black families--black section of town. And from there I went to [Charles] Sumner High School in Kansas City, Kansas.  That has turned out many outstanding academists and other type of things.  Because of its attitude about education probably more than anything else.  And then secondly by virtue of the staff that was recruited.  Because as you can well imagine for a black person in education--which was a, you know, high type of a field to be in back during the Depression days, they couldn't go any further.  You know, high school teacher, college teacher.  There was, you know, no place higher to go.
Speaker 1: Post office. That was about it.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You could do that.
Speaker 2: But that wasn't a educated, you know, position.  And just as soon as integration came about, that staff just disappeared.  Because they were--they were sought after by, you know, industry that was looking for what we called at that time, you know, that "demonstration black".  So some of 'em went--or at least one guy went to the patent office, chemists went to a paint company, and that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So this is in this Sumner School?
Speaker 2: Sumner High School in Kansas.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Named after Charles Sumner. Isn't it?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay. The abolitionist of--.
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Massachusetts.
Story_ID: 8800
Speaker 1: Try to think back what it was like to be a kid in Prairie View [Texas] and--in Kansas City [Kansas]?  And what was the--some of the things that you saw coming up that people wouldn't know anything about now?  And what kind of sights and sounds and smells? What was the housing like?  What was the community like, you know?  And what were--what were you like as a little boy?  You know?
Speaker 2: There were things that you got used to, because you always did 'em.  Consequently, you know, I didn't feel necessarily put upon, except that I knew intellectually, you know, that I was being put upon.  Very luckily too, Kansas City, Kansas was a place where you were not deprived.  It had everything that any middle class or upper middle class person would want or need or be exposed to.  We had role models.  We had, you know, the educational facilities.  There were sororities, fraternities. There were black businesses. There were black professional people.  You know, doctors, lawyers.  You know--these people that came to be judges.  You know, do--when that civil rights, you know, period broke down.  There was no black white strife.  So that, you know, this thing was never beat on you--or beat into you like it was in some, you know, locations probably, you know, in the unfortunate South or unfortunate North, you know, so far as that's concerned.  Because the thing that really gets to people is to have that type of thing heavily on them, you know, when they are a kid.  You know, when it gets into your mind and to your brain.  And, you know, you have to go through a period of, you know, getting over it, or you know, feeling badly about it all your life.  That was never an experience in Kansas City, Kansas.
Speaker 1: So there's no racial strife in Kansas City?
Speaker 2: Not the bad kind.  Like I said when--it was something you got used to.  You know, you knew where you were supposed to be, you know, on the--on the bus.  If we wanted to--to dress, you know, like black kids did, we'd do that.  But whenever we were going into the white part we would, you know, dress like you were supposed to in the white part.  We had segregated schools, but they were (laughs)--they were better than the white schools.  So it was--you know, it was not something that ever, you know, dealt heavy on the youth in Kansas City.
Speaker 1: Were the public accommodations segregated--segregated there?
Speaker 2: Yes they were. But we had, you know, black restaurants.  My aunt that I lived with was a cateress. And, you know, if the--any of the sororities, fraternities or, you know, church groups or other kind of clubs, you know, wanted to, you know, to have, you know, something--a catered dinner.  You know, they--that was, you know, what she did.  My uncle, her husband, worked on the--he was a waiter on the railroad.  And then there were other things he did.  He sold vacuum cleaners, you know, as times went on.  And I can't--no--can't remember any of the rest of the things right off that he did.  But--actually, if its somebody was more impacted on (laughs), it was him.  Because he was also a college graduate of Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] in Pennsylvania.  And he was a teacher and coach down at--you know, at Jackson State [Community College, Jackson, Tennessee].  And he and my aunt wanted to have children.  And she had difficulty having them.  And she couldn't go to the hospitals, you know, in-and I don't--I believe it was in Jackson, Tennessee.  But I'm not sure exactly what the--which--where that school was.  But he gave up his job.
Speaker 1: Lane [College, Jackson, Tennessee]?  Was that Lane?
Speaker 2: Maybe it was Lane.  Yes.  Lane.  And he gave up his job and went to Chicago [Illinois].  And became a waiter on the--whatever it is. Is--what is the New York Central [Railroad]?
Speaker 1: (Unclear). Whichever the one that went between Chicago and New York.  And in order--in order to be around those kind of black medical facilities that my aunt needed in order to have a child that they couldn't get in Tennessee.  And he never, you know, practiced his college education again from the standpoint of going into a school.  Now he practiced his education, you know, personally.  He was in a, you know, a fraternity man from, you know, from college and all that kind of stuff.  And he kept and stayed involved with that.  And whatever college does for you educationally, you know, other than, you know, preparing you for job skills.  You know, he had that always.  And this little bit of entrepreneurship, you know, that he had I'm sure was all part of that same direction.
Story_ID: 8801
Speaker 1: What kind of a little boy were you growing up?  And what kind of a youth were you?  You know, what were you thinking about?  And what were your--what were your perceptions of what was going on around you?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I was the best kind of a youth, man (laughs).  I don't remember, you know, anything particular.  I know that I wore out about three or four sleds, you know, in the--in the wintertime in Kansas City, Kansas.  It has beautiful hills. And you know, that was a big thing.  There must have been--I don't know how many kids in our neighborhood.  But there were, you know, a bunch of kids.  And we just had a, you know, just a good time.  We had a black Y [YMCA, Young Mens Christians Association].  I don't remember if it was a YMCA or YW[CA, Young Womens Christian Association].  So we would go there in the summer and do arts and all that type of stuff.  And, you know, we would have--didn't have organized sports back in those days.  But we used to, you know, play softball, you know, in the street.  And I'm trying to think.  What do you call that?  Was it three to catch or four to catch--five to catch?  Or something or other.  It's just however many kids you had, you know, played.  And it was on a, you know, a brick street.  And, you know, my knees were covered with, you know, scars.  And Vaseline on these scars, you know, all summer long.  And, you know, school was pretty much the same way.  You know, just a lot of fun.
Story_ID: 8802
Speaker 1: And we had--you know, like I said, we had, you know, boys and girls in ample numbers.  Until, you know, the war [World War II] started in '40 [1940]--'39 [1939].  It was--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) It was '41 [1941].
Speaker 1: It was 1941 when we--when U.S. got into it.  And I guess it was '42 [1942]-'43 [1943].  Two airmen that had just recently graduated from Tuskegee [University, Tuskegee, Alabama] came to Northeast Junior High School [Kansas City, Kansas] to a program, you know, that we had there in the school.  And I says, "Ahh.  You know, those guys look good in those uniforms."  And I had a hobby of making airplanes.  My, you know, room was, you know, just full of airplanes hanging from, you know, from string.  And so that was, you know, one of those alternative things that I wanted to do.  But then when I saw these guys in these uniforms, that sort of did it.  And then I, you know, started--started getting serious about, you know, about books and school and all that type of thing.
Speaker 2: Now this is while you were in high school, right?
Speaker 1: This was really the--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Junior--.
Speaker 1: The--this was junior high.  I was in the ninth grade, which would be the first year high school, you know, ordinarily.  And one of those guys was Pulliam.  "P-I"--"P-U-L-L-I-A-M" or "P-I-L-L"--"P-U-L-L-I-U-M".  And he was from Kansas City, Missouri.  And this other fellow.  I never can remember his name.  He was from St. Louis [Missouri].
Speaker 2: Now you--had you--did you have a chance to go watch airplanes at--when you were--are you--you said you had an interest in planes.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Oh yes.  Over at the the municipal airport in Kansas City, Missouri. We used to go there all the time. Just watch airplanes come in and go.  Of course, that was back in the days when people had to, you know, put their feet back down on the--on the, you know, on the ground.  You got on the airplane, and got off, you know, from the ground.  And, you know, the men wore suits, and the women wore, you know, dresses and fur coats and things of that sort. It's nothing like it is now.  But yeah, we used to go there and do that.  You know, there was no restrictions, you know, for that public accommodation anyway.  So--.
Speaker 2: You could go and watch and--and dream and--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Story_ID: 8803
Speaker 1: What other things were you involved in, in high school?  You were involved in football, I think.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And in other sports?
Speaker 2: Yes. I should not have been, because I was, you know, too little. But, you know, all the big boys had gone to war.  And, you know, the seniors, and I guess some of the juniors too.  So it was a matter of, you know, who's gonna make up this football team.  And my uncle, as I had mentioned to you, was a coach.  And he thought that a boy could not be a man without playing football.  And so I got, you know, involved with football. And then at that time--at that--at [Charles] Sumner [High School, Kansas City, Kansas], it was a wonderful high school.  Because the teachers really put it on the line, you know, so far as what they were trying to do.  And, you know, the message was always, "We are doing this for you.  So that you can compete when you get out of high school." And, of course, KU [University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas] was always, you know, where you were going. Although a lot of people didn't go to KU.  But it was always a matter of, you know, competing when you go to--when you get to KU.
Speaker 1: Now Sumner was a black high school?
Speaker 2: Sumner was a--was a--was a segregated black high school.  I have come to find out in latter years that actually it was a prep school.  And they--that's what they did. They prepared you for going to college.
Story_ID: 8804
Speaker 1: I was asking you about the teachers. And you said that there was a, you know, a real strong relationship between the schoolteachers and the parents because a lot of the teachers had taught the parents already and they were on a first name basis with 'em. And even some of your relatives were the teachers?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: So--you didn't have a lot of room to fool around in school, right?  You had to--(laughs).
Speaker 2: That's right.  'Cause my uncle [John A. Hodge] was principal at [Charles] Sumner High [School, Kansas City, Kansas].  And whenever I got a little too far out of line, the teacher will say, "I'm going to send you to the office.  You know, do you want to go?  Or do you want to straighten up?" I always straightened up.
Speaker 1: A wise choice I guess in that situation--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yep.
Speaker 1: That situation.  Yeah.  So a lot--there's a lot of close interaction between the parents and the--and the students and the teachers.
Speaker 2: And the parents.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: The parents and teachers who--.
Speaker 2: Plus back in those days education was a respected commodity.  And teachers were highly respected.  I don't think that either one of those conditions exist today.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Not everywhere, and that's to be sure. It wouldn't be--it would be probably unusual then for a parent to go to school and challenge a teacher about something the teacher said to their son or daughter (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Exactly.  Yes.
Speaker 1: And--and today it happens it happens quite a bit.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, but the parents don't know the teachers.  You know, the teacher is just, you know, a person out there.  They aren't a part of your community.  You know, like these people were.  And especially--and I don't think that a lot of parents look up to education and teachers like they used to because education is really sort of--or educators and education is sort of a, you know, mid-level type of a position nowadays.  You know, compared to, you know, the things that you can do with, you know, in corporate America. In technology--especially, you know, electronic technology.  And, you know, just so many other places where you can make, you know, so much more money.  It is affecting us here in Wichita [Kansas].  We used to have a number of black teachers.  But their numbers have decreased, you know, considerably as these people have retired.  And no new black teachers are coming on, figuratively speaking.  And I'm sure it's because, you know, there are so many other better job possibilities in other areas now that didn't exist then.
Story_ID: 8805
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school then you were inspired by the--then the encounter with the two Tuskegee Airmen? And you were determined to become a pilot? Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what was your senior year like?  And what was your--how did you prepare yourself then?
Speaker 2: You could almost say I didn't have a senior year.  When I was seventeen, I enlisted in the Enlisted Reserve Corps [ERC].  And of course with that expressed purpose.  And I took the physical exam and all that kind of stuff. That when I became eighteen, you know, I would--I would be subject to, you know, being enlisted.  And that happened within two weeks after I turned eighteen.  And--like I say, I had taken, you know, the test.  And passed the test for pilot training and all that type of thing.  So it was a matter of going to Keesler Field [Biloxi, Mississippi] for basic training. And then going on to Tuskegee [Alabama] for pilot training.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So how was that experience?  Was it--was it what you expected it to be?  Or what--?
Speaker 2: What experience was that?
Speaker 1: Going into pilot training.
Speaker 2: Going into pilot training?
Speaker 1: Hold on just one second. (Break in tape) Okay, go ahead.
Speaker 2: Okay. Sir, what were your impressions of the Tuskegee [Army] Air Field and training there?  I mean what--did you encounter what you expected to encounter?  'Cause you had idealized it, you know, to a certain degree.  And were things the way you expected them to be?
Speaker 1: I don't know that I expected them to be, you know, one way or the other.  But I can tell you that all of the strife here again in my life--all the strife was over, you know, by the time I got there.  Except the Tuskegee [Alabama] Air Field was a, you know, segregated airfield.  You know, the--some of the office personnel--a lot of the office personnel was black. There was, you know, some that was white.  And, of course, the--probably the main office or staff was probably white.  But there was--they--there was--were--there were one or two blacks.  One or two that had--I came in so late that some of these guys were coming back from, you know, from overseas.  The 99th [fighter squadron] and the 332nd [fighter group],  they were coming back.  And some of them, you know, got jobs there as, you know, officers on the field.  And a lot of that, you know, things that they did to those first pilots--first trainees--I could say that was all over with.  You know, by the time I got there.  Consequently, when I am, you know, confronted by people who know.  And I don't let everybody know that I am a--officially a Tuskegee Airman.  I don't portray myself off, you know, that way.  Because I didn't have to go through, you know, any of the stuff they went through.  Or those bomber guys up at, you know, the--up in Michigan [future members of the 332nd fighter group trained at Selfridge Air Base, Harrison Township, Michigan].  You know, I wasn't involved with any of that.  I just--it was really a prep school experience.  We were all eighteen, nineteen-year olders.  Came in.  Got our flight training.  And in six months, we were discharged.  I had about thirty days of leave time.  Or something like that.  And when my leave time was--or before my leave time was over I was sitting in college, you know, summer school. Taking classes to, you know, the first classes in college.  So it was really a nice, you know, a prep experience.
Speaker 2: A lot different from some of the other people that went (laughs)--.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Yes.  Very much different.  That's why I don't, you know--because I really have as much respect and look up to those guys as, you know, as these people have  that are--that would ask the Tuskegee Airmen, you know, to come in and talk to them.  And, you know, talk to the--talk to us about, you know, Tuskegee and the, you know, and the problems, you know, that you had.  You know, I didn't--I can say essentially that was all over with, you know, by the time I got there. Okay.
Speaker 2: Now that was--You got there in 1940--'44 [1944]?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Forty--I was in 45H.
Speaker 2: '45 [1945].
Speaker 1: So I got there in '45 [1945].  As a matter of fact, the war ended when I was in--the war in Europe ended when I was in basic [training], I believe.  And the war [World War II] in Japan ended when I was in advance [training].  And each time they gave all of the--the cadets a chance to be discharged.  Because you might not know or remember that you had--you--on the--when you were discharged out of the Second World War, you had so many points overseas.  You know, gave--well you got one point a month I believe. And if you were overseas, you got some additional points. And when you--if you were in combat there were some additional points.  So, you know, somebody like me with just about, you know, twelve or fourteen points. You know,  I probably would still be in the military now trying to accumulate enough points to get out.  But they did give the cadets a chance.  And consequently, my class--I don't think there were--there were more than twenty.  If it was that many of us that decided to stay. Because most everybody just took a discharge.  But I had, you know, started this thing.  And it was something that I wanted to do, you know, so badly.  And it also was one of those things that, you know, that gives you confidence for life, you know, if you do it.  I probably would have wound up a bottle case.  You know, if I had not, you know, made, you know, completed the training. But I don't think about that, 'cause I did. Yeah.
Speaker 2: And so--So it was pretty, You know, it was a positive experience for you.  And did you get a chance to get to talk to some of the guys that came back?  I mean--I mean--.
Speaker 1: Yes.  As a matter of fact, I had two guys were--as instructors, you know, later on.  That was--seem like to me it was a captain or was he a major--Turner [Captain Andrew D. Turner].  Seem like to me his name was.  I had formation flying from him.  And I think probably some bad weather flying from him. In basic, we were flying AT-6s.  And there was a captain.  Hot dog. I can never remember his name.  My sister sent up--sent me a picture of him from the Seattle [Washington] newspaper.  And he was--that was just about two or three years ago.  And he and two or three--two or three other guys, you know, from that same era were there.  And they had a picture of 'em, and so forth and so on.  So yeah.  I had--had some of those guys as instructors when they came back.
Speaker 2: And you took instruction as a bomber pilot?  Right?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Medium bomber.  B-25.
Speaker 2: B-25? Okay. Alright did--Okay.  So how long did you stay in the Army Air Corps?  Or did they change it to--?
Speaker 1: No.  Six months after that they discharged us under the Excess Officer Act .
Story_ID: 8806
Speaker 1: Then [after leaving the Army Air Corps]  you were free to go to school, I guess?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  So where'd you go to school?
Speaker 2: I went to K State--Kansas State University [Manhattan, Kansas].  Took pre-vet[erinary].  And then went into the veterinary school.
Speaker 1: Now--.
Speaker 2: And I finished--of course, the veterinary school is four years.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: I finished that.
Speaker 1: Now let me--let me ask you this.  Now when did you become interested in becoming a vet--a veterinarian?
Speaker 2: To some degree that was part of that prep school experience at Tuskegee [Army Air Field, Tuskegee, Alabama].  When the war [World War II] was over and we had graduated from pilot school.  And we were all officers.  Lived in the bachelor's officer's quarters.  And, you know, as these guys were discharged some of those bachelor's or officer's quarters turned into college catalogue libraries.  We had college catalogues from every place.  Because we had guys, you know, from east to west, north to south.  And as you can well imagine if you have, you know, fifty or seventy-five guys, you're gonna have at least, you know, fifty schools that people are interested in going to.  So we use to really hold unprofessional placement conferences. You know, "What are you gonna take?"  "You know, I'm going to engineering school."  Some guy wants to be in aeronautical.  You know, since he was in the Cadet Corps.  That was all part of his interest to begin with, etc., etc.  My--the aunt that I lived with had always had convinced me.  She always said, you know, "Go into business."  She said, "We have too many teachers, you know, in the--in our family."  Because most of--a lot of the--my aunts and uncles, you know, were teachers in different locations.  And so that was, you know, instilled into me.  And so I was looking at what I was good at in the way of, you know, subjects in school.  And what I was not good at in school.  And so I knew that it have to be biological science.  I sort of had it in mind.  Picked out microbiology, you know, bacteria and viruses and things of that sort.  But I looked at that, and says, "You know, I'll wind up a teacher."  And here again the availability of things in Kansas City, Kansas for a black youngsters without, you know, within twelve or fourteen blocks of where I lived.  There probably were three or four or five guys who had taken veterinary medicine. And most of them--as most veterinarians of that time had gone into meat inspection. And I didn't want to do that.  And, of course, if I was gonna follow my aunt's, you know, instructions, you know, that would not be the thing to do.  And so it became easy for me to transfer that biology area that I, you know, did best in, in high school to veterinary medicine.  Or something where you could do and go into your own business.  And with those role models--if you want to call 'em that, I--you know, I knew they were available.  And so it was, you know, easy to make--make that choice.
Story_ID: 8807
Speaker 1: Tell me about veterinary medicine school. The school and at Kansas State [University, Manhattan, Kansas]. And what did you have to do?  And what--when is it--a lot like going to--It's a lot like going to regular medical school, I guess. That's what--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Did you have to actually learn about more species, right?  And all of 'em are different.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Well tell me about it (laughs)--.
Speaker 2: I don't know what I can tell you.  Except that--at least I didn't, you know, consider veterinary medicine as being hard per se.  There was just such volume.  You know, that you had to, you know, to, you know, to learn and deal with.  And, you know, you just--you just did it.  After that time--because even with my interest that was, you know, cultivated by the presence of these two pilots, I still didn't have that real gung ho, you know, about education.  I did better, you know, in school after that.  But after I went to college, and even now, I have a insatiable desire for knowledge.  And, you know, curiosity that, you know, that I follow.  Consequently this last year since I have discontinued work--and I prefer that term to that retirement.  I have been in college out at Wichita State [University, Wichita, Kansas] taking courses that I'm, you know, curious about.  A lot of, you know, history of Western civilization.  Like history of Roman world.  All the U.S. histories, you know, building up to 1865.  That seems to be a breaking point. And then another class--1865 and beyond, introduction to world geography, meteorology.  I've self-taught myself astronomy.  You know, many years ago.  And I've been taking the, you know, the astronomy magazines and all that type of thing for, you know, over twenty years.  And then you just, you know, you've self teach a thing--self teach your thing about, you know, whatever you're curious about.  And I had, you know, that's a big thing in my life.  And it has been ever since college.  I really got to lovin' it.  They had--There were two--I guess I think our class had about seventy or seventy-five.  And the two of us were black.  There was another guy and myself.  And I must give K State [Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas] credit.  I might not give Manhattan, Kansas so much credit because I ran into more discrimination there than I did in Kansas City, Kansas.  And there was a question of, you know, where we would eat?  You know, many times in Manhattan.  And it--it's like so many other things in times.  The guy that would feed us was--a Chinese--you know, in (unclear).  He'd feed us but the rest of the guys wouldn't.  And, you know, there was a mindset that I created.  And I think maybe everybody else did too.  You sort of, you know, prepared yourself for going, you know, to a--maybe like going to war.  You know, the attitude that you gotta take.  But not as bad as a lot of my friends that I ran around with in Kansas City [Kansas] that went to universities in the South.  You know, Fisk [University, Nashville, Tennessee], for example.  Girls going to Spelman [College, Atlanta, Georgia], and things of that sort.  That they had to prepare themselves.  And they did that outwardly--verbally.  You know, when it came time to go back to the South.  So that they could, you know, prepare their minds for, you know, for yes sir--no sir, you know, type of environment that they would be in.  But we just didn't have very many blacks at K State.  But K State has always had black students.  And they have always treated them well.  The aunt that I lived with from the sixth grade on was a graduate of K State and she directed me to Dr. [George] Bronson here in Wichita, Kansas who was a--who was at K State the same time that she was.  K State provided masters degree locations for many of the black southern agriculture related positions, you know, for schools in the South.  You know, they would come there in the summertime to get their masters and Ph.Ds.  So the--except for some little differences.  Because you couldn't go to the swimming pool for example.  But the year that I was there, they had the first black athlete--a football player.  You know, and things of that sort. But the public accommodations weren't too spiffy.  Black people coming through on the bus, you know, had a hard time at the bus depot.  You know, getting milk for babies and all that type of stuff.  And so I guess that was 'bout the, you know, the size of K State.
Speaker 1: Did--were there any particular teachers that were mentors or who took an interest in you as a student?
Speaker 2: Not particularly. And I don't know that I can say that or not say that.  Among other things when I was a senior--it might have been a junior.  I don't know.  I had one of the jobs of keeping one of the small surgery rooms clean, you know, at the--at the veterinary hospital.  For which I got, you know, some amount of money seems to me.  I also was monitor at the men's dormitory when I became a junior or senior.  Prior to my doing that there was another black guy who was monitor.  And the dormitory, you know, housed both black and white.  The blacks were segregated within it.  But you were monitored over the whole bunch, you know, as a black monitor.  So, you know, that was the type of experience that you had at K State.
Story_ID: 8808
Speaker 1: So when you got out [of veterinary school at Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas], what were your prospects?  Were you--did you immediately seek to open a business, to set up--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) I came to work--My aunt talked with this Dr. [George] Bronson.  And Dr. Bronson had recently had a heart attack,  and he was looking, you know, for somebody to assist him.  So he could have, you know, time to, you know, relax and recover.  And so I came down here [Wichita, Kansas] to work for him.  And I did that for five and a half years.  And, you know, looked around.  And, you know, opened up my own place.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Tell me what--what would be a--what was a typical day like as a veterinarian--black veterinarian in Kansas?  Most people don't know. I know I don't mainly. What are the issues?  And the--what kind of cases are black people bringing? I guess they're like others in some ways.  But--did--were most of the animals that you treated pets of people?  Or were they--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Well that's what I was.  I was--I was--I was a--I was a small animal. I had a small animal practice.  Mostly dogs and cats.
Speaker 1: So there's a difference then.  If you work on any--you're--some veterinarians just work on farm animals and that sort of thing?  And then some work with small animals?
Speaker 2: Yes. And then they can be broken down even more.  But we don't have it necessarily here.  But if you are in the, you know, dairy country why, you know, the large animal is dairy. If you are, you know, some of 'em are on location where they have a lot of horses.  You know, Kentucky being a case in point.  Although I don't know of any black veterinarians who were down there.  You know, that would determine more or less.
Speaker 1: (Unclear).
Speaker 2: We had--.
Speaker 1: Lexington [Kentucky] was the primary horse country isn't it?
Speaker 2: Well yeah.  But I knew that I would not be, you know, welcome there.  And I wasn't interested in horses anyhow, at that particular time. Although I was interested in horses as, you know, riding them for fun.  You know, which I did in my lifetime as well.  But that was a--there's a black veterinarian--I can't remember exactly where it was he practiced in Kansas.  Wellington [Kansas] was one 'em.  Dr. [Charles] Rocquemore who was the president of the State NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  And in veterinarian medicine there was, you know, the--your clientele has a choice of coming to you, or not coming to you. And you never know whether who's not coming to you because of race or whatever.  So, you know, you don't worry about it.  You just worry about doing a good job with those who, you know, decide to come to you.  And I'm suspect like everything else.  You know, there're probably areas or, you know, some cases where maybe some of your clients will tell some of their friends who have an animal's having trouble.  They aren't being satisfied.  "You know, why don't you come and go to my vet?"  And then they might come.  You know, for--'til an animal's well.  And go on back out.  Or maybe they'll come and stay with you. But those things you never know.  So you never get--you never clutter your mind with, you know, the whos and whys, you know, from a racial standpoint.  I never did.  It's a bad thing to do.  You make too many mistakes when you do that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So people would bring you basically dogs and cats. I guess. What else other kind of pets?  Hamsters and stuff?
Speaker 2: To a lesser degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Mostly dogs and cats?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  What were some of the typical diseases in dogs and--?
Speaker 2: Oh, you know, just like with people. The communicable--the communicable diseases.  You know, like distemper and all of those.  We used to have, you know, many more cases of those when I first started practicing.  Because people didn't vaccinate.  And this was something that, you know, takes years of education to bring about.  And also had been helped by, you know, by the growth of the national economy.  You know, people do things when they have money that they don't do when they don't have money.  So you have those--and then you have all your surgeries and all the new things.  The endocrine diseases, diabetes.  You know, it just goes on and on.  And your, you know, surgical procedures you need to do for your abdominal conditions.  So--and then you do a lot of, you know, boarding and grooming type of things.  Those have become less, you know, as people have set those up in separate businesses now.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) So--.
Speaker 1: Now that's when somebody leaves town or something? And they need to--they leave their dog with a veterinarian.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm, mm-hm.
Story_ID: 8809
Speaker 1: I just wanted to ask you about the changing landscape, I guess of the pet situation in the United States.  And in poor communities, like in the black communities it is generally poor. Years ago it that seemed that people--a lot of people, you know--they didn't take their dogs to the vet.  Because they didn't--they couldn't afford it. And a lot of times no matter how much they loved the dog, they-if they try a home remedy, and that didn't work.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You just have to, you know, get well on his own. Or--or, you know, face the consequences. Have things changed since?
Speaker 2: Very much so.  As a matter of fact, when I was in veterinary school, you almost had better mention your interest in farm livestock. Because that was the economy that the state legislature would support.  You know in their support of schools.  And that's what we did.  And that's what the school did as well.  Sometime along the way, somebody came up with this idea.  And it has proven to be valid.  The human-animal bond.  And it has, you know, changed the relationship of pets in the economy.  To the place where now the veterinary schools--K State [Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas] anyway.  And I suspect other schools as well.  Are trying to do--are trying to figure out how on earth they can get farm animal veterinarians.  Because just about everybody is going into pets.  Now this human-animal bond too has been brought on by, you know, economic growth.  Where people have, you know, more money.  And they can, you know, afford, you know, a pet of their choice that they have to go and buy, you know, for hundreds of dollars.  And--so consequently even from educational standpoint, the home--the human-animal bond has, you know, has changed the way that veterinary practices take place.  And how, you know, people treat and care for their animals.  It's not at all unusual to have a case, you know, a medical case, you know, over a thousand dollars.  And to have people readily pay for it.
Speaker 1: Okay. In the past--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And--and--
Speaker 1: Past--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Go ahead.
Speaker 1: (Unclear)
Speaker 2: I bought--and course most of my--I know Dr. [George] Bronson was.  Mine was.  Most of our practices were--we had, you know, predominantly white clientele.  You know, in excess of 90, 95 percent.  Although you might--in the case--because the first small animal hospital in Kansas was started right here in Wichita [Kansas] by a Dr. [Thomas Gilbert] Perry.  And Dr. Perry of--in his later years moved on to teach at--at the Veterinary School of Tuskegee Institute [now Tuskegee University, Tuskegee, Alabama].  And he left there and opened a practice up in Tennessee.
Speaker 1: So this was a black doctor? He was the first to really open--
Speaker 2: A small animal--exclusively small animal hospital in the state of Kansas.  Yeah.  And his clientele was primarily, you know, primarily white.  Although his office--and all of the offices that I know of--short of mine were, you know, in black neighborhoods.  But, you know, people would come to them.  So it was just--it was just--just one of those things.
Speaker 1: Okay. I know in the past there were a lot of--in days gone by there were a lot more strays on the street.  And people were concerned about getting bitten by a stray dog, or they were concerned about stray cats.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: This--
Speaker 2: The leash law took care of that. And most all cities have it now.  If your animal is outside of his fence.  He's got to be on a leash.  If he's not he'll be picked up, and taken to the, you know, pound facilities.  And you have to go and get him out.  That price of going to get him out has skyrocketed (laughs).  So that--and, of course I'm sure it has skyrocketed.  Because just about every house has a fence nowadays.  You know, it used to be a time when people didn't get fences.  If you go and get a fence, you know, that was a big extra expense.  Well the growth of the economy has taken care of that too. People can afford fences.  So they, you know, put the animal in a fence.  Because if you had those roaming--well you just--you don't have those roaming dogs, because they're picked up.  And if the owner, you know, is not found or if they don't come and pick 'em up, they are put to sleep.
Story_ID: 8810
Speaker 1: I don't know if your clientele is still largely white or--or was it when you--when you finally--?
Speaker 2: Yes, it largely was. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  But I guess you could still--of the black people that came to you--well first of all in the general population, are more people cat lovers or dog lovers?
Speaker 2: Dog.
Speaker 1: Oh okay. And in the black community is it still--is it basically the same thing?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  And what--is there--and--were--have you been able to tell a difference between those who love dogs and those who love cats?
Speaker 2: (Laughs) Not really.  Not really.  But even in, you know, with the black and white issue. It's still a matter of more economic growth, you know, than it is anything else.  You know, how much extra money do you have over your basic needs to spend?  And if you do, what are you gonna spend it on?  You know, a dog or, you know, something else.  And those people who choose to spend it on dogs take care of--black people take care of their animals you know, just as well as the--as the next person.  But needless to say, you know, if you--if your income is, you know, you're below the, you know, certain federal guidelines level, you know, you--you're--you're not gonna, you know, take care of your animal.  Because you can hardly take care of yourself.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Consequently and unfortunately--and I don't know how to get around it otherwise.  You know, those who have, you know, perform.  And those who don't have don't perform.  You know, not--in regards to animal care. Or participating in the animal industry of anyway.
Speaker 1: Right. Now there's a--in the--I know--well once again, just going to the--to the past. A lot of black people--I know they had dogs, no matter how poor they were.  Sometime I mean they could still have the dog.  They still have a loyal dog.  And I don't even know if they--weren't necessarily even able to feed a dog. The dog could go out on its own and get his food. They would help the owner actually find food (laughs). In some instances.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: I know that from growing up in the '50s [1950s] that some of the dogs actually helped their owners find (laughs) food.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: And the--and nowadays we don't really see--I don't think we see as much of that kind of--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Yeah. That--that's true.
Speaker 1: --as back then.
Speaker 2: Early on when I first started practicing--And I graduated from K State [Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas] in '51 [1951].  One of the big things we did among other things that if--that you hardly ever do anymore was wash an animal through.  And that was where you would give him a high enema.  And actually wash--give him a enema.  You know, a sufficient volume, and so forth and so on.  That, you know, it wasn't a enema where you would give him just enough water to have a stool.  You gave him enough so that that water came out the front.  And you would wash all this stuff out of his stomach as well.  And we used to do that all the time.  Because animals would come in with, you know, symptoms of being garbage fed.  Or before they had fences and leash laws.  You know, they would get in the garbage cans.  And they be coming with all sorts of symptoms of, you know, indigestion, gas, food poisoning.  And, you know, you wash some of the darnedest things out of 'em.  You know, chicken feet, spoiled meat, gravy, roast.  You know, peas and carrots and all that kind of stuff.  You know, would all come out.  And, you know, had very foul odor.  I had--I don't know when I've done that during--in past years.  You know, in the--in the recent past years.  But that was a big thing to do in '51 [1951].
Speaker 1: Dogs will eat almost anything.  I mean from what I've seen from watching dogs or walking--
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) That's true.
Speaker 1: A dog would--there's hardly a dog that won't (unclear)--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah. And, of course, all of these things sort of go together when you have, you know, the requirement for fences. And then, you know, here comes along a means of garbage disposal.  Other than putting 'em in the can.  You know, you wash it down your sink.  You know, all those things, you know, come into play on, you know, this condition of, you know, the poor fed, un-housed, un-fenced animals, you know, that used to exist in poor neighborhoods.
Story_ID: 8811
Speaker 1: It seems as though recently there is a trend of ghetto youth--usually young men in the poor section of town raising vicious dogs--extremely vicious dogs--pit bulls and Rottweilers and so forth.  And actually raising these dogs for sport.  And there--there've been incidents in Chicago [Illinois]--got a big public outcry over dogfights. And where I come from in Ohio, same thing. I hear about it, you know. I met--in fact I met a young man from Kansas City [Kansas] that had a couple of Rottweilers and, you know, and pit bulls that he was raising, you know, to fight with other dogs. So what--tell me about that. Do you have any thoughts about that?  And what to do about that?
Speaker 2: You know, it happens in all racial groups.  That particular thing does.  And those guys aren't necessarily poor, you know, that do that.  As a matter of fact, they usually have, you know, pretty good incomes. You know, it's just a cruel thing to do when you have, you know, one animal fight another.  You know, even worse than boxing where you have, you know, two people fighting each other.  Especially in boxing, you know, where one has, you know, a chance to even either get knocked out or pretend like he's knocked out.  Or, you know, say, "I don't wanna do this anymore," or whatever.  Whereas animals you can't do that.  It's just a cruel thing to do.  And it--and it goes on across racial and economic lines.
Speaker 1: Have you ever had a customers that have had participated in this?
Speaker 2: Oh yes--
Speaker 1: Can you spot that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Have you ever had a instance where you've had to tell somebody--have--you've had to advise the police about something--some one?
Speaker 2: I've not had to advise the--advise the police about it.  No.
Speaker 1: Do you say anything to the person who brought--that brings in an animal that's honestly been in a fight, you know?
Speaker 2: You know, what is there to say?  You know, they come in and say, "My dog has been in a dog fight."  Or, "He's been chewed up."  Or whatever. And, you know, the admission is already there.  They don't try to, you know, to hide what they are doing.
Story_ID: 8812
Speaker 1: It has to do with fashion.  And that's the cropping of the ears and tails of certain breeds. Do you do that when you deal with small pets?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It used to be those type of things were accepted.  Some states are, you know, making laws against it.  Both the ears and tails.  And, of course--and people have animals.  You know, the states that do that, they usually--if they want it done, they usually take it to, you know, some place where they can get it done.  You know, to another state across the--across the border line or something.  You know, from one state to another.  Just whatever.  And, of course, if you can well see those things aren't showing up in the shows yet.  Which means that somebody's doing it. And that's--so it's just a matter of, you know, if you have a--live in the state that says you can't crop ears. Why then you take your dogs out of state to have those ears cropped.  You know, if you want to have it done.
Speaker 1: What are your thoughts about that?  Do you think that's a--?
Speaker 2: We didn't used to be--to look at those things as being inhumane.  But we have become more humane conscious.  And I don't know that I have a hard and fast position on that as yet.  After all, I'm a veterinarian that is, you know, coming across that line.  Whereas the new veterinarians that'll be out, you know, this year or five years by virtue of college training.  They're going through, you know, the veterinarian school where, "No we don't trim ears anymore.  We don't crop tails anymore."  You know, they--would if they come out with that training they might, you know, might continue it
Story_ID: 8813
Speaker 1: Can you tell me about a remarkable case maybe of a--of a--of a sick pet?  And--or--and the response of their owner? I mean there's gotta be something that really stands out as being, you know, the most memorable case or the most memorable case you've ever had.
Speaker 2: I can't think of any.
Speaker 1: They're all pretty routine (laughs)?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  All right. Nothing--nothing really--have you ever (unclear)--?
Speaker 2: (simultaneously)  Oh I'm sure--and, you know, but they had been, you know, cases that you are more, you know, satisfied than, you know, than others.  And I know that I've had some of those thoughts and some of those experiences.  I just can't--I can't, you know, chalk 'em up right now or this fast.
Speaker 1: Have you ever met a remarkable dog or cat that just baffled you on how they could some of the things they could do? Or--
Speaker 2: I can't give you much of an answer to that either.
Speaker 1: An educated pig or something?  Or (laughs)--
Speaker 2: No.  No.
Speaker 1: You know, a counting dog.  Or--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: You know--
Speaker 2: No.  Just routine stuff.
Speaker 1: Just routine--
Speaker 2: Just routine stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah
Speaker 2: Okay.  Yeah. I was wondering if the--I think--imagine there's got to be at least of one story like that.  And--
Speaker 1: Well, I'm afraid not. Of course even in this year since I have stopped practicing, I have, you know, had the experience of, you know, five or six people, you know, when I was, you know, out to some type entertainment or at the grocery store or something like that.  You know, would come up to you.  And, you know, they had found out that you have discontinued practicing.  And they'll come up and say, you know, who they are.  And that they had animal by such and such a name.  And, you know, you saved his life. And so forth and so on.  And, you know, how it affected me or my family.  Or I was a kid then or something like that.  And, you know, you can't do anything but draw a blank.  You know, both on the name or the incident.  Because it might have been, you know, routine to me.  But it might have been exceptional to them.  So I don't know (laughs).
Speaker 2: Did you ever get a sense of when--when people bring their animals in of how much they love their animals?
Speaker 1: Oh yes. Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Can you tell the difference between somebody that's bringing some--an animal in for somebody else?  Or that you don't (unclear) about?  You know, bring them in. Their loved ones.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That doesn't happen very often.
Speaker 2: Okay.  It's usually the person that really love the animal bring them in.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: You ever had to switch pets for the sake of the kid or something?  I, You know, (laughs) when they bring an animal.  And--.
Speaker 1: Oh you try to get the owners and yourself, you know, to be discreet, you know, when animals are brought in under bad circumstances.  You know, when there're kids.  Sometimes two owners will make arrangements to have their pet put to sleep.  With the proviso that, you know, if this kid calls, you know, you would tell him that he died.  You know, in natural conditions as opposed to being euthanized. You know, that type of thing takes place all the time.
Story_ID: 8814
Speaker 1: You've been involved in Boy Scouts [of America] for a long time.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: (simultaneously) Thirty--thirty-five years.
Speaker 1: Tell me how you got involved in that. 'Cause you--you're really devoted in that. Right?
Speaker 2: I used to take kids out of juvenile court, boys particularly.  There was a lady that was in the juvenile court, I can't remember her name right now. But, you know, she made a inquiry, you know, if I would do something like that, and I did. And I ran into a kid that, you know, was very quiet and very sullen.  And, you know, I tried to, you know, talk with him and work with him.  And he finally wound up going to prison.  And I decided this is too hard.  You know, psychologically, emotionally and mentally.  You know, what can I do to keep kids, you know, from getting to this place anyhow.  And so I, you know, through a process of, you know, what type of thing that you'd want to have kids exposed to.  You know, with all the ethical values type of thing.  You know, I ran into and remembered Scouting.  And I went down to the [Boy] Scout office.  And, you know, told 'em I'd like to be a Scoutmaster and have a Scout troop.  And I had a hard time getting that done.  Because the guy says, "You don't have enough time.  You aren't in the right job classification, you know, to be--take that much responsibility in going camping and all that type of stuff with boys.  You know, why don't you just join our board."  And, you know, I told him, "Well, you know, it's either the Scout troop or nothing."  And so they, you know, let me do that.  And I Scouted in the black community for many years without very much success.  You know, probably for all the reasons that you know.  Until one of my sons came along.  The second of three sons that I have.  And he was in my Scout troop.  And it was a strange thing.  I would have seven boys one week.  Another seven the second week.  And another seven the third week.  And then the fourth week this first group of seven would come.  And so you could--you could never get a, you know, a continuation of a program.  And so after my son made First Class [rank]--why--he was 'bout ready to get out because he said it wasn't very much fun.  And a couple of other guys were too.  And while I was getting him to--some merit badges that he had finished.  I said, "Well. You know, you might as well go on go to a merit badge counselor and, you know, finish this out."  And we went to a guy that invited us to his Scout troop. And it was a white troop.  And so we got involved with that.  And I stayed with that troop for many years.  Because I had a third son that was about five years younger than the, you know, than the--than the second son. And so he went with that troop immediately. And he stayed in long enough to get his Eagle [Scout rank] and all three [Eagle] Palms [awards].  And, it also gave me a chance to relive the childhood that I didn't have.  You know, and the--when the things that we did.  You know, camping and the other activities. Spelunking, you know, was a case in point. You know, going caving.  And all sorts of things, you know, like that, that we exposed them to.  And it was--I was the, you know, an Assistant Scoutmaster at one time.  For a long period of time I was the outdoor chairman.  You know, so I planned the campouts.  You know, locations.  You know, what we were gonna be doing.  In of the way of program and stuff like that.  And in between times I have been on the, you know, Scout Board on two occasions.  Stayed on one time for five years.  And dropped off and went back on for five years.  Another time and gotten off.  And at the present time I do--I'm involved with our district's advancement committee.  And I have the responsibility of sitting in on the Board of Reviews for boys that make application for Eagle.  And they have to--at that particular board, they have to have a district representative.  Well our district has, you know, a group of men.  And I'm one of those that do that.  And then I'm also the--a Unit Commissioner for a--for a troop.  And to do that, you know, you mostly just visit.  And, you know, try to make sure that this particular troop, you know, has continuity, you know, a good program.  Anything that Scoutmaster needs or needs to know or needs to do.  You know, you're there constantly or in and out on somewhat of a basis, you know, to be able to, you know, to help them.  And that is very good because Scoutmasters usually follow their sons.  They come in for four--and you find a Scoutmaster's been there for five years.  You found an old Scoutmaster.  You know, for the most part.  So they need somebody, you know, for that--transition period.  And that's what the Unit Commissioner works with the Scout Master and the other members of the Troop Committee. You know, to make sure that they--or to try to make sure that they have that continuity.
Speaker 1: Okay. Have you been able to fulfill at all the dream you had in the beginning of trying to do something for the black youth in the community?  In terms of that?
Speaker 2: You know, that's something that you never know.  As a--I'm--I suspect teachers can--can have this feeling more than a person like you know, me working with kids in Scouting, for example. You just never know what impact, you know, you're having, if any at all.  And it might not occur 'til many years later.
Story_ID: 8815
Speaker 1: Tell us about the young man who [went to prison]?
Speaker 2: Well--it was, you know, one of those learning experience type of things.  You know, when I discontinued getting boys out of the juvenile court. And this kid, you know, who had broken my heart.  And had, you know, wound up in prison. I got a telephone call many years later, you know, from this kid.  "Dr. Jackson, can I come by?"  And he came by and he told me, you know, what had happened to him and where he had been.  And how much I had helped him in his life to see how his life was, you know, while he was in prison.  And he wanted to come by and thank me.  And to tell me he'd never do it again (begins crying).
Speaker 1: Well, what was he in prison for?
Speaker 2: Well he was just in prison.  But it was one of those things that, you know, really broke my heart.  It had to do with, you know, a parental failure. Which is a thing that I had the most difficulty accepting.  Because his parents went in front of the court--in front of the judge says, "Do with him what you think you need to do.  I can't do anything for him."  And I'd never heard that before. And the guy has been exemplary, you know, since that time.  He's gotten a job.  He's gotten married.  He's had kids.  And, you know, when I would run into him.  He would say--tell his kids, you know, "Come over here.  I want you to meet this man.  You know, because I wouldn't be anything if had not been for him." So, like I say, "You never know."
Speaker 1: You never know the impact you have on someone's life. One thing you do can stay with them for a long time I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: When we make a difference.
Speaker 2: But that was--(crying) I would say, you know, one of the defining moments in your life.  That was one of 'em for me.
Story_ID: 8816
Speaker 1: What other civic activities have you been involved in, in Wichita [Kansas]?
Speaker 2: Oh, I ran for school board once and was defeated very badly.  You know, and all fraternity stuff that I'm not, you know, too involved with anymore.  And mostly I like to be known, you know, as the--oh, how do I put that?  Because I think of, you know, play as a big part of my life.  And, you know, thank goodness my kids weren't players as much as I would like for them to have been when they were here at home.  But they certainly have gotten to be that way, you know, since then.  And I think that play is a important ingredient, you know, in life.  And, you know, by playing means going to the mountains. And things you do at the mountains, for example, camping, you know, climbing mountain peaks, you know, skiing.  We used to go to family camps, you know, the kids and I in the summer.  You know, have a--have a horse hobby.  And, of course, when you're in [Boy] Scouting, you know, we do canoeing and stuff like that.  And a few years ago I went on a sea kayaking trip with my oldest son.  And a few years after that went hiking--four day camping in the Olympic National Park [Port Angeles, Washington], you know, another time with another kid.  And just got back two weeks ago--'bout two weeks ago from sailing around the San Juan Islands [Washington], you know, with another kid.  The point being, you know, that--especially when you in the job classification I was.  And with the other responsibility that I had.  You know, you can't sit back and close it all up.  And say, "Well I'll do that when my--have my two week vacation."  Well, maybe you don't have a two week (laughs) vacation. Because you need money for school or something another.  So it's a matter of, you know, what can you do every day, you know, to satisfy this thing that we do when we vacation?  And so I have tried to find--and it's been no trouble.  You know, find those things that I can do any time, every time, every day, anywhere to get that sense of satisfaction.  And at the present time--and it has been for twenty-five years.  I've been in the bicycle club here locally.  And so I do bicycling.  And--which is a--something I--It's a plaything, you know, that I enjoy doing.  As a matter of fact, I was in, you know, at the university [Wichita State University, Wichita, Kansas] in a class this morning.  I biked up there and biked back.  You know, rather than to drive.  And I get a big thrill every time I throw my leg over the--over the top bar and zip on down the street.

Speaker 1: Did your mother [Viola Jackson] get a chance to see you become successful?
Speaker 2: Mom died when I was first year--second year at--in college [Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas].
Speaker 1: So she--.
Speaker 2: So she did see the Air--the Air Cadet part.  But she did not see the college part and beyond.
Speaker 1: Okay. But you were basically living up to the expectations she had set for you before.
Speaker 2: Well I was in college and that was as much of expectations, you know, as any--.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --parent has--from that particular time.
Speaker 1: That's remarkable that not all parents--especially black parents had the expectations their kids would go to college. 'Cause she went to college.  And she probably certainly expected that you would go. Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It was something that was never spoken in our family.  It was, you know, expected.  There was never a discussion about, you know, what I'm gonna do if I don't go to college.  You know, it just didn't come up.
Story_ID: 8818
Speaker 1: When you look back on your life, what would you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Really nothing.  You know, just a ordinary average guy, doing ordinary everyday things.
Speaker 1: How would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Just like that.
Story_ID: 8819
Speaker 1: What are your hopes and concerns for the black community here in Wichita [Kansas]?
Speaker 2: I have no extra special ones because I think that with housing being broken down with, you know, civil rights, you know, are pretty much on line.  You have, you know, court protection now.  You know, that you didn't have before when things get too far out of bounds.  Many people aren't necessarily satisfied.  But so far as I'm concerned, you know, when you--we used to be--not be able to come to the table, you know, with our concerns.  And even if you did come, you know, they were not respected too much.  They were not acted on.  Now you can come to the table and be a real participant.  You might not get what you want.  But you can come to the table and talk about it.  You know, raise Cain about it--threaten, you know, whatever.  Insofar as voting or legal or whatever and that's all that anybody has.  You know, minority, majority or whatever is to come to the table, and present your case.  And, you know, bring to bear, you know, whatever you can bring to bear.  And take whatever you have to take.  You might come back next year and do it all over again. That's satisfactory to me.  And that I think happens right now.  The biggest concern--and really the only concern that I have--and is one of the reasons why I'm going to start--since I've sort of halfway gotten my throat together.  I had a sinus problem this past year that was affecting my throat.  And you can probably hear a little bit of hoarseness in it now.  But now that I've gotten that together, I'm going to start volunteering at one of the elementary schools to do some mentoring.  And here again it's one of those schools--one of those elementary schools--black teachers, you know, are disappearing.  It's one of those schools that has kids--black kids bussed into it.  And I don't even know the address of the--of the school.  I suspect that it is, you know, farther out, you know, from the center.  Although black people live all over town now.  So you cannot be sure just, you know, what you're seeing when you're looking.  And it's those kids and those parents who are not passing the benchmark test.  And then not doing anything about it.  You know, your kid flunks a test that he should flunk if he-you know, if he's had the year's experience in this class--in this year.  Really it's--I think it's second, five and eight grades when they take those tests. So if you're the fifth--they take the test when you're in the fifth grade.  That means the stuff that you should know, you know, from the second grade to the fifth grade.  And the--they give those things. And, you know, a kid passes it. And you have too large of a percentage of those kids' parents don't make them go to summer school, you know, for remediation.  When the schools provide transportation.  And then don't charge 'em either.  They don't charge 'em either for the transportation or for schooling.  It is accepting of a low station in life that I feel is, you know, terribly, terribly unacceptable both parentally and certainly for the child who can't--you know, he's not old enough to even make the decision for himself.  He's got parents making the decision that is going to, you know, threaten his lifelong existence.  That everybody knows that if you can't get education you're going to wind up in the prison.  Because you are going to, you know, do something illegally, you know, to get the money that you need to exist.  And our, you know, prisons are full of black youngsters.  And the common thread, you know, among all people in prison is a low education.  And that's my biggest concern.  You know, not for the--for the regular black. Because we--we're every place now.  You know, even to high government positions.  You know, that weren't there early on.  Probably have more corporate presidents than what we know.  It's not news anymore.  So, you know, so far as that--as black people are concerned, those who can help themselves, you know, by coming to the table, I'm expecting them to get in line, no question.  They'll be at the table if something happens to 'em.  But these kids and their parents that aren't putting forth the effort to give them the basic needs, you know, to exist.  That's really my biggest and maybe my only concern.
