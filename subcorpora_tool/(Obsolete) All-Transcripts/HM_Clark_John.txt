Speaker 2: The same as mine.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  John Francis James--.
Speaker 2: John Francis James Clark Sr.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you don't have to spell that for us or anything.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And what was his birth date?
Speaker 2: 1874.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was born--okay.  Now let me start with your mother's side of the family first.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: But what do you know about your mother's side of the family? Where does she come from and what do they do?
Speaker 2: They were runaway slaves.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And they ran away to West Virginia, Charl--No.  A place called Tuppers Creek. And the reason why Tuppers Creek, you can hide in the mountains and so on.  So after the war--the Civil War, her great uncle came and moved the family to Tuppers Creek, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Now how do you spell that?
Speaker 2: T-U-P-P-E-R Creek, West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Tuppers Creek.  Okay.
Speaker 2: It's out about 14 miles outside of Charleston.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  And so that was just after the Civil War or just--?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So they had been slaves in Virginia?
Speaker 2: Well one of her uncles who had run--After the war he came and brought the rest of the family to Tupper Creek.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There were originally from Virginia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any stories that they passed down about life in those days? Any stories they tell?
Speaker 2: Well hiding from the slave catchers.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And a--well I have plenty of stories after slavery.  My mother was the oldest of nine siblings.  And she was five when she came to Tubber Creek.  She went to a one room school.  But she was--such a desire to be successful, she started teaching in school.  She had bought a farm one hundred acres when she was eighteen years old.  And she helped her father Andrew Peters farm also.  Farmer--later they discovered gas.  Yet--natural gas.  And the gas wheels started pumping.  Today not as much money as it was originally.  That's how our farm became very prosperous to her.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.  That's a story--a success story there.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: 'Cause we didn't appreciate the Depression.  But it was a little better off.  We did have another source of income since dad was only being paid two hundred dollars every two weeks. Then he finished Harvard, finished Chicago U [ University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois]. That's what his salary was.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  That's in 1929, 1930?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah, during the Depression.
Story_ID: 5057
Speaker 1: Did you know your grandparents?
Speaker 2: I knew the fathers.  Never knew the grandmothers.  They died before.  My grandmother on my mother's side got TB [tuberculosis].  TB was very rampant. And she was also--four siblings with TB.  Fortunately my mother never had difficulties with TB.  And so my father's first wife died of pneumonia.  So you can see how infectious disease played a part.
Speaker 1: Now your grandparents on--your grandfather on your mother's side you knew him.  Right?  You said?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Now what was he like? And what was--?
Speaker 2: Well, he was a--he was not an educated man.  He was an ice carrier.  You know he had to--he carried the ice on his back.  He was a wonderful man.  And he told us all the stories about the country and so on and about Brer Rabbit and so on.  He would tease (unclear) quite a few.  But my mother and them--he would leave the country with a cow to sell. And mother said, "They wouldn't see papa again 'til the money was gone and the cow was gone." And he was a pseudo-minister (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So he was kind of like a circuit rider.
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  He would come back to the country two months later.  And the kids learned to all do many things.  That's why mother [Hattie Peters Clark]  was quite enterprising.  In fact, she was the first licensed real estate broker--woman in the whole state of West Virginia.  Yeah, Mama was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's your grandmother?
Speaker 2: No, my mother.
Speaker 1: Your mother was.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Speaker 2: 'Cause my grandmother pushed her to do many things.  When she bought the farm, she wanted to put her grandfathers name on the--her father's name.  Mother said,  "No, he'll pay for it.  You can't trust Dad [John F.J. Clark Sr.] all the time." So.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Hmm.
Speaker 2: But that grandmother died of TB.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now tell me about your father's side of the family.  How far back can you trace them?
Speaker 2: Alright. Yeah.  But their folks were slaves from North Carolina. He was such a good builder of barrels and so on he bought himself free and bought his wife free.  So my grandfather was born in 1850, a free man.  'Cause he--and they left North Carolina and moved to the Southern part of Ohio.  And so he had 8--my grandfather had eight brothers all through Ohio.  So it's a lot of Clarks through Ohio.  So that's where we got down to Vinton, Ohio.  That's where we migrated to.  My father was born and he went to school in Gallipolis.
Speaker 1: Gallipolis.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Gallipolis, Ohio.  Right.
Speaker 2: And he led his class in Gallipolis.
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are a lot of black people in Gallipolis.  It's been a group of black folks there since the nineteenth century--the middle of the 19th century--the early part.
Speaker 2: So that's it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gallipolis, Ohio.  Right.
Speaker 2: That's his background.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: And James is a little different.  Grandma James.  They are from Jamestown.  And they were indentured slaves so they informed me.
Speaker 1: Jamestown, Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.  And what happened with them, the master's child fell in the river and they saved his life.  So the master set them free and gave them a buggy and a wagon.  So they went to Charleston [West Virginia].  And there, they had the oldest black containers company. Anybody knew James in the United States.  The great, great [grand] son just sold the business recently.
Speaker 1: Now what kind of business was it? I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: The James.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Yeah.  But what kind of business was it?
Speaker 2: Well first it was a--he carried coal.  Then he started to have the vegetables and so on.  And eggs and so on.  Recently the grandson came--a friend of Rockefeller sent--who used to be governor of West Virginia.  He made a connection for him to McDonald's.  And he started selling medicine and so on to McDonald's.  And they sold their business recently.  And he's down in Dallas [Texas] now.  I think it's in 'Black Enterprise' say they sold at 30 million.  But that's the James I'm kin to.  I didn't get any of the money now .
Speaker 1: You weren't in on the money. But they were enterprising James.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But they've been recognized as the longest black business owned by one black family.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright--now do--Are there any other stories from that-from your father's side of the family, that you remember? Any good stories?
Speaker 2: (laughing) Well yeah.  They're all good. Well my father--I kind of lost the Clarks when I went to West Virginia.  But most of the emphasis my dad is mainly on education.
Story_ID: 5058
Speaker 1: Let's start with your mother [Hattie Peters Clark].  What was she like and what did she do for a living? You said she was the first licensed black woman--You know, realtor in the state.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Actually when you think about  it, her education was a little different my dad.  From a one room school.  Then she went to West Virginia.  It used to be called West Virginia Institute (unclear) West Virginia State.  Her great uncle was president Byrd Prillerman.
Speaker 1: How do you spell that name again?
Speaker 2: For a while.  What?
Speaker 1: Her great uncle.
Speaker 2: Byrd, B-Y-R-D, Prillerman, P-R-I-L-L-E-R-M-A, Prillerman [Prillerman].
Speaker 1: Oh, Okay.
Speaker 2: He was president.  And she went to West--Institute of West Virginia State [College].  Now but she was more or less like a poor cousin.  She lived with him and she started there in 1904 and finished in 1907 to be a teacher.  And one unusual thing she always liked to tell us about,  Booker T. Washington came to see Byrd Prillerman  and  since he--Booker T. Washington  was quite an authority--gave advice to Presidents, gave advice to Queens and he lived in Malden, West Virginia.  He--after slavery, he left Virginia--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And went to Malden where the Salt (unclear). And--but he was, always appreciated him. 'Cause Byrd Prillerman's wife wanted my mother to eat in the kitchen where she usually eat.  And the president said, "No,  I want my great-niece to come and listen to Byrd Prillerman." And she repeated  to us over and over what Booker T. Washington had to say.
Speaker 1: So her uncle brought her in to eat with Booker T. Washington.
Speaker 2: Yeah, at the table.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Brought her to the table.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So it was the highlight  of her life.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: See eventually she did many things for the Prillermans. 'Cause they  had--my mother was quite (unclear) a lawyer (unclear) to help the Prillerman estate.  But she was a realtor.  Sold real estate.  And she tried to assist--All her siblings got a house. She was given her commission and--.
Speaker 1: Don't get distracted.
Speaker 2: --they (unclear).
Speaker 1: They just came to deliver something.
Speaker 2: --but, in fact, we had no gender prejudices.  I realize women such a prominent part of my life.  I had no prejudices that women cannot do.  That's why I think that my sisters done so well.
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'Cause you have two sisters who--.
Speaker 2: (unclear) that picture right there.  That shows right there--and the here we are (unclear) this is Lucille Brown.
Speaker 1: --we sit----if you could sit back.
Speaker 2: Oh I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: He can--yeah.  Alright.
Speaker 2: Her name is Lucille Younger.  She is the first doctor in our family.  She finished in 1944.  I don't know if you knew Dr. (unclear).  Well he was quite an obstetrician and gynecologist in Chicago.  But she finished in 1944.
Speaker 1: There's a doctor Beasley in Chicago.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  But I only mentioned (unclear) 'cause of her classmate.
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) who was a gynecologist.
Speaker 2: And he was quite prominent.  You know, for--and there's my sister Harriet.  She finished in medicine in 1950.  So--and that's my brother Charles finished medicine in 1949.  So from--we had no problem with the girls doing well.  And they insisted other people be a nurse.  Dad's, "You're smart enough to be what ever you want to be."
Story_ID: 5059
Speaker 1: West  Virginia as you said earlier was the home of Booker T. Washington?
Speaker 2: Well--.
Speaker 1: It was also the home of Carter G. Woodson too.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well he came and taught.  He had taught at West Virginia State [College] for the while.  We had a very heavy history of black educators, black (unclear). Mordecai Johnson, a man name Vernon Johns.
Speaker 1: [Dr.] Vernon Johns he was the pastor of--.
Speaker 2: In Charleston.
Speaker 1: Dexter Avenue Baptist Church--.
Speaker 2: The first--.
Speaker 1: And--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  That's part of my great, great uncle (unclear)--the first Baptist Church.
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.
Speaker 2: John Francis James.
Speaker 1: Reverend Johns preceded Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] in--.
Speaker 2: Not only preceded-.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: They got rid of him 'cause he was too radical.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.
Speaker 2: If you read 'Parting Ways', that's why they mov--made him move (unclear) Johns.  Johns was so radical to the right.  In fact, that's why they left West Virginia.  He was talking about we had to be self--help, self-support.  And he'd come to church with mud on his shoes where he worked In his farm, and old ladies ran him away.  And he went to Birmingham [Alabama] and he got away from there.  That's why they got [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.].  'Cause he--They thought he was younger and more passive.  Yeah.  But (unclear) my dad insisted that Vernon Johns made some of the excellent sermons that he ever heard word through Vernon.  Vernon also went to Oberlin [College].  Vernon Johns.  And he won a scholarship for being so brilliant.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: So we had Leon Sullivan.  See we had a lot of--I think, why--West Virginia unique, was never a heavy slave state. Rocky Mountains and so on.  There was--and when your leaving, free people were looking for a place to go.  And I think that's why quite a few people came to West Virginia.
Speaker 1: Was in the mountains a good place to run away?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And the walking.  You can't walk but so far.  With sleeves hiding and walking and so on.  But I think that's what made West Virginia a little different.  Lot--the laws for segregation were not as harsh as most of the lower states.
Story_ID: 5060
Speaker 1: Tell us about your father [John F.J. Clark Sr.] now.  What was he like and what did he do? Tell us about his schooling.  You've mentioned it a couple times.  But just tell us the whole story.
Speaker 2: Well Dad's first wife died and he didn't marry again, 'til sixteen years later.  Now he was forty-four when I was born.  And he was not a man throwing the football and so on and basketball.
Speaker 1: Now how did he and your mother meet?
Speaker 2: Well, she was teaching. School teaching.  Yeah.  And--.
Speaker 1: Was she teaching in his school?
Speaker 2: She was at the same elementary school.  She was (unclear).  In fact, he spent more time with us academically.  He loved to do math.  And we loved the math.  And he went to give examples and so on.  Was in charge of the summer school.  Occasionally he didn't have enough people, he'd make us go to summer school .  Not because it was needed it, 'cause education wise.  So that's whether we--I didn't learn--well as far as sports, he was not out there throwing the ball with me.  Yeah.  I wanted to play football so bad.  But during our education, I started skipping grades. And I was thirteen in the tenth grade.  I weighed 108 pounds.  I was sixteen when I graduated and I weighed a 126 pounds.
Story_ID: 5061
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father's school days again.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I--.
Speaker 1: You say he went to the University of Chicago [Chicago, Illinois].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Now how did he get to the University of Chicago?  That's unusual for blacks to--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well his mother, who went to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio] and she established a black school for black girls in Charleston [West Virginia].  And she--you can see she was quite an educator. I think she was educated first before she went to Oberlin some at Ohio U[niversity. Athens, Ohio].  Ohio U. used to be another name in Athens.
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: I can't--I'm not sure about the exact name.
Speaker 1: Oh it used to have another name?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But it's Ohio University now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In--.
Speaker 2: Down in Athens.
Speaker 1: Which is near West Virginia.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's right across from West Virginia.
Speaker 2: She went to school down there.  And she was determined her boys would be highly educated.  And her brother was the one that started the business.  And that's why my dad [John F.J. Clark] came to Charleston.  To be with his great uncle--not a great uncle.  His uncle.  The fact that the Clarks married the James-My grandmother James-James established the business married a Clark.  So we're actually blood cousins on both sides.  So he knew--he went to school during the summer.  Teach and go to school.  And went to Chicago U. that way.  Went to Harvard [University, Cambridge, Massachusetts].  He started at Harvard early in the '20's [1920s].  But he did get his bachelor's in 1925. So-and he continued to take courses at the University of Chicago.  He was working on his Ph.D.
Speaker 1: Was he an education major?  That what it was?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  His field was education.
Speaker 1: Okay.  That's something.  That's remarkable for those days.  Because very few--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: Blacks went to Harvard or University of Chicago in those days.
Speaker 2: We all thought so.  All the siblings (laughs).  He said, "You--(unclear) get paid too much for your education."
Speaker 1: So he never really made the kind of money that he thought he would make.
Speaker 2: No, my mother made the money.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: My mother made twice as much as my Dad.
Speaker 1: But he had a big position, but no, you know.
Speaker 2: Well, I guess (unclear) respected him very highly.  He was always being start NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] late summer.  He had my oldest sister Susan, state of West Virginia purchase (unclear). State of West Virginia only had two year medical school. Other two years was accepted at University of Virginia.  But we couldn't go there even two years.  So we sued them.  And that brought on the rights of Southerners to pay when you had to leave the state.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: The other states Mississippi and so on and so.
Speaker 1: This is significant.  This is highly significant.  Because Vernon Johns from what I read in 'Parting the Waters' by Taylor Branch, had his daughter do the same thing to the state of--I think it was Virginia.  I think he--yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: After he moved from the church in Alabama.  You know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Well, he was a very brilliant man.  Vernon John--I can't think of the man's name who was the president at the University of Chicago.  Hutchinson I think [ref. to Robert Maynard Hutchins].  He went to Oberlin [College, Oberlin, Ohio].  He was a scholar at Oberlin.  But Vernon Johns, that won the scholarship over here.  And so that's what my Dad told me.
Speaker 1: Now did you know Vernon Johns? I mean did you talk to him?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well he was a minister.  I didn't know all the history.  I--'til I started, you know,  reading about him. [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and so on.
Speaker 1: Vernon Johns--they describe him as being able to quote long passages of poetry and Shakespeare.
Speaker 2: Not only that.  They asked him, "Why should he come to Oberlin?"  And he said that something you had to have a foreign language.  He started speaking German (unclear).
Speaker 1: Hmm.  What this?  A person I guess you would call him a genius (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Well yes.
Speaker 1: Alright.  And your father.  Now he's not a lightweight either.  You know.
Speaker 2: No, no.  We all admired him for that being able to help out (unclear). We appreciate more and more how he directed--didn't force-directed our curriculum.  At the--all these little small schools you have a lot of trouble registering to take the right course and so on.  Dad already had written it out for us.  We had envious.  Most teachers they'd say, "Here comes those Clarks.  Their schedule is already written out."  Well it proved to be  right. I finished Ohio State.  Didn't have to repeat anything.  My sister finished Smith College [Northampton, Massachusetts].  When she went to Smith, only five black students went to Smith at the time.  That's the same school Miss [Barbara] Bush didn't (unclear).  She would drop out (laughs). I can't say (unclear) but Regan's wife did finish Smith (laughs).  So I joke with the people in Ohio State (unclear).  They ask me, "Did you finish high--?"  "Nah, she even had to go to Smith for the first (laughing) (unclear)."  But I'll say Susan didn't lose anything from Howard [University].  She (unclear) Southern Cal.  So Dad had an unusual knowledge of education.  And especially (unclear) to his children.
Story_ID: 5062
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, mainly I was not born in the ghetto.  I'm not using ghetto (unclear).  I was born one block from the new capitol in Charleston [West, Virginia].  In fact, Charleston capitol was moved down to where I was born.  And we were all born at home.  And the place where we were all born now is a big 7-11 store. And not only that--I told the woman from the local paper--I still own 7-11.  Land lease has been twenty years or something now.  So mother predicted, "The capitol to move to you."  And it has.  And I own several other pro--pieces of property.  But the point, it was not too many black family there.  I learned to play by myself.  I had sport with my siblings.  But I guess that's I went into track.  'Cause I could get a lot of practice and visualize I was at the Olympics.  And I was impressed with Jesse Owens and so on.  And the sad thing about it, Jesse Owens was still at Ohio State when I came there.  He was a hero in 1936.  I'm there in '43 [1943].  Jesse Owens never graduated.  That's a blight for (unclear) to me it is.  He spoke very well.  I think made a mistake either start running for [Alf] Landon instead of [Franklin D.] Roosevelt . Yeah he did.  But it's sad. It's sad. But that's one of the things I think I became-I had a sport I could participate by myself and practice.  I would get up about 4:00 in the morning and practice jumping. I did the same thing about studying.  If I had a problem, Dad [John F.J. Clark Sr.] would tell me, "Go to bed."  He'd wake me up at 4:00.  I'd get up and read my Latin or whatever problem I had.  It helped me later to be a good student and to be an obstetrician.  I can go to bed, get up any time.  I was educated well and made it matter.  I was--at Ohio State I was housed with eight boys.  (unclear) waste time.  I would always go to bed, get up when (unclear) decide I couldn't sleep and study. So I was a habit I developed and developed very well.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  Okay.  Now what kind of a little boy were you when you were--?
Speaker 2: Well I guess I told you I wanted to play football.  And--but in Charleston at that time, they had no age limit.  See in most public schools, an eighteen year old can't play any more.  We'd go somewhere like London (unclear) game couldn't start.  'Cause coal miners.  We had to wait on players to come out of the coal mine.
Speaker 1: So you're playing against grown men--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Well they--yeah.  Well it took some men eight years--eight years to finish high school and work and so on.  So what Dad would do, he'd tell the coach, "Don't put that boy in."  I would sit on the bench so.  Occasionally I'd get in.  But I was playing against grown men.  Leon (unclear) played football.  He was my age.  But that's why (unclear) send me a coach (laughing).  So I never got much of being a football player.  But I enjoyed the track thing.  'Cause I got a book.  I read.  'Cause my coaches wasn't interested in track.  And I--that's why one thing I'm proud.  I taught myself.  And what had happened about track, at West Virginia State I joined the fraternity--Alphas [Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity].  When I went to Ohio State the Kappas--captain of the track team was an Alpha. And they had a contest for all the fraternities.  He insisted on me going down to compete.  And the high jump was about over.  And I went in, picked up where the boy left.  He had thought he had won.  And the track coach of Ohio State saw me jumping.  "You come out for the track team."  And so I did.  And I could beat enough to win it and earn a letter.  And I graduated in March. And medical school didn't start 'til June.  So he wanted me to compete as a graduate student. And I said, "No, I've had enough."  'Cause they had to--I stayed and attracted people-at Ohio State did.  Jesse Owens, Dave Albritton who won the Olympics--high jump.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he lives in Dayton [Ohio] now.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Milwaukee got second in Olympics. So I was never that great.  I got--shanging the high jumping changed with the flop.  When I was jumping, the head went first said diving.  A flop is seeing a man can jump eight feet now.  The world's record is eight feet. I could jump six-three or six-four.  But I was very proud I taught myself.  I had no-- wasn't a bad long jumper.

Speaker 1: Where did you go to high school?  Well grade school and high school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: What were the names of your schools?
Speaker 2: Garnet and my Dad was principal there --.
Speaker 1: Garnet it was called?
Speaker 2: For forty-six years.
Speaker 1: Was it Garnet?
Speaker 2: G-A-R-N-E-T
Speaker 1: Yeah, Garnet.
Speaker 2: It was named after another man that had two "T's".  Who had named (unclear).  But they ran out-The stone cutter (laughing) forget to put the other "T" on it (laughing).  So it was just named Garnet.
Speaker 1: Was it named after Henry Highland Garnett?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Amb--His son was Ambassador of Haiti or something wasn't he?
Speaker 1: Yeah, to Liberia.  He died in Liberia.
Speaker 2: Alright.  That where it was named.
Speaker 1: Henry Highland Garnet. He was a Reverend in the--.
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: They executed a reverend.
Speaker 2: Black (unclear) (Laughs). But he was president for forty-six years.  They let him graduate all his siblings.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So Garnet--it was both grade school and high school ha?
Speaker 2: Well grade school was William Boyd.
Speaker 1: Board?
Speaker 2: B-O-Y-D.
Speaker 1: Okay, Boyd.
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (unclear).
Speaker 1: Alright.  Boyd Elementary School and Garnet High Hchool [Charleston West Virginia].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I just wanna get that established.  So you went to West Virginia State first, then Ohio State [University, Columbus, Ohio].
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And then when you finished--.
Speaker 2: West Virginia State from 1939 to 1941.  And then '41 to '43 [1941-1943] I went to Ohio State.
Speaker 1: And then you went to graduate school for --?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Howard [University Medical School, Washington D.C].
Speaker 1: Howard. Alright.
Speaker 2: I can tell you a long story about that.  I knew they only accepted black students at Ohio State Medical School if you were from the state of Ohio.  And I knew that.  I registered from Vinton, Ohio. But they wouldn't let that fly.  They saw I lived in West Virginia (unclear) grade school and so on.  So the dean told me I was a colored boy he told me.  They weren't gonna accept.  Well I had to get this registration trade.  I was too young to change residents.  I would finish--the law-I had a lawyer.  I had to be twenty-one.  I would graduate at twenty.  So--then  Ohio State had their on draft board.  So they gave me three months to get into medical school somewhere.  So I could not go to Ohio State.  I couldn't change my residence.  And my dad took my grades over to [Howard University president] Mordecai [W. Johnson].  He looked at them.  He called the dean and said, "John Clark II.  I  wish my own sons grades were this good."  So I received a notice and a telegram from Howard (unclear) my birthday in 1941.  So that's why I was designed to go to Howard.  I'm glad I did.  I made many friends.  It's the easiest school I've been to in life.  No.  (Unclear) I'm not showing off.  If he was putting me in Lincoln [University, Lincoln Pennsylvania] school I would've probably flunked out.  But medicine was made for me.  And another thing. I had an older sister when I came to Howard that was two years ahead of me.  What made it easier for me.  Which (unclear) which subjects and so on.  So I'm--I feel it was a handicap I thought at first.  But it was the best thing that happened to me.  And for Howard.  I made a lot of friends.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now who were some of your teachers at--.
Speaker 2: Drew.
Speaker 1: Howard--?
Speaker 2: --Drew.
Speaker 1: Okay.  [Dr.] Charles Drew?
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.  He was a very--he wanted me to go into surgery. But I was determined that I wanted to work with women.  And, in fact, I was the youngest clinical head at Howard. I was made chairman at 35.
Speaker 1: Let's get there slowly.  Let's see.  Now--.
Speaker 2: Alright.
Speaker 1: Now you said the--How did you decide to become an OB/Gyne doctor?
Speaker 2: Well I always liked women (laughs).  There was no question about it.  I thought I had the personality for it and I enjoyed my work (laughs).
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  So it wasn't a hard choice.
Speaker 2: No, no.  It wasn't a hard choice.  And actually coming from West Virginia to Washington, I hadn't seen too many pretty women.  Washington had so many pretty women (laughs).  It like throwing the--spitting in the river. (Unclear).  West Virginia as a (unclear), only about 100,000 black people.  And Charl-- our high school was the largest high school for blacks in West Virginia.  Total number from 10 grade to 12th only 400 students.  They have that many in one class here almost. So it was quite a change.  And even at Ohio State when I was there, was not too many blacks going to Ohio State.  You know, blacks could not play basketball in the Big Ten when I was there.
Story_ID: 5064
Speaker 1: When I was on the track team, I would occa--we would occasionally go to--I went to Indiana.  And we stopped in Indianapolis overnight.  I could not eat with the team. Bill Willis threw the shotput.  And he said, "Well we'll fix the coach." He'd ordered 50 eggs. I ordered so many eggs.  And went to Bloomington.  Sat down to the table in Bloomington.  He said, "Well since you boys like eggs so well I'm bring--buy you some more eggs."  Willis told him, "Coach, if you don't order me two steaks, you're gonna hit the floor."  And (laughing) that's why I remembered Bill so.  The same thing when we went to Ann Arbor [Michigan].  I stayed in a hotel named Roosevelt.  We couldn't eat with the team.
Speaker 2: Not even in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  All the way up in --.
Speaker 1: We stayed in Detroit and took the bus.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: I remember all these hotels.  One was named Lincoln in Indianapolis.  Another one was Roosevelt in Detroit [Michigan].
Speaker 2: Now wait a minute.  You couldn't stay in the Lincoln hotel?
Speaker 1: No, I stayed in Lincoln.  I couldn't eat in the dining room.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And I know what to do.  And see we stayed over night in Indianapolis.  The bus in Bloomington.  In Bloomington we couldn't eat with the team.  We couldn't eat with the team in Indianapolis.  Couldn't eat with the team in Detroit--Roosevelt.
Speaker 2: Probably [West] Lafayette [Indiana] either, I guess.  Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: And pretty much--.
Speaker 1: Well only 'cause I wanted (unclear).  I was only on the indoor track team.  Michigan State I don't remember.  But I wasn't impressed with those things.  Well anyway I'm glad I came to Howard [University].  I thought Washington [D.C.] would be a--I was always bashful (laughing).  child.  I didn't know how I would survive this big city and so forth.  But having a sister was the best thing that happened there.  Like a design to come to Howard.  In fact, (unclear) when I came to medical school, I was elected president of my class in medicine here.  And I was all four academic years president of the class.  But one school calendar was a war zone.  See '43 and '46  [1943-1946] (unclear). And I was very vocal (laughing).  Changing the curriculum and doing certain things.  It was an enjoyable time for me.
Speaker 2: Okay. Was it--it was never a tough time when you (unclear)?
Speaker 1: (simultaneously) Not academically.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Actually--Well I say a few things in life not important. It is a fact.  Two P's, either political or propaganda.  And actually when I applied for a resident--well an intern, you only have a few choices.  Freedman's Hospital [Washington D.C.] when I graduated, Harlem Hospital [New York, New York]or (unclear).
Speaker 2: Homer [G.]  Philips [Hospital, St. Louis, Missouri]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, Homer Philips.  All those are small little hospitals. So I wanted to do OB/Gyn [obstetrics/gynecology].  And I stayed at Freedman's.  I accepted Harlem and so on.  Harlem was a very prejudiced.  You interned at Harlem, but very few people at that time got to do a residency in OB. Italians and Jewish people were very strong and they were graduates.  And when I applied at Howard for a residency in OB/ Gyn, Dr. Ross thought I was too radical.  I talked too much.  I asked too many questions and he gave several sermons.  He gave me about--a sermon about Peter (laughs) and what Paul--What was the Lord had changed the name?
Speaker 2: Oh Peter.  Yeah he was--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: No. No, Paul.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: He changed his name from Saul to Paul.
Speaker 1: (unclear) Gave me that lecture.  He said, "Clark you need to--."  See I would ask questions.  'Cause I'm raising questions.  "What are you doing?  Or why are you doing this?"  He was always being the (unclear).  And he gave me a lecture about Peter.  "You need a real change."  And he asked me, "Where'd you go to school?"  I'd say, "Ohio State."  "Well I'm glad you didn't go to Lincoln. Cause you never see a freshman talking to a sophomore.  And I said, "Well I'm glad I didn't go to Lincoln too."  (laughs).  That didn't help it.
Story_ID: 5065
Speaker 1: I just wanted to go back to that discussion about you causing trouble asking too many questions.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So they thought you were kind of an agitator (unclear).
Speaker 2: Well I was a little agitator.  See, I was president of the class and I knew I was not having trouble flunking out.  My dad [John F.J. Clark Sr.] said, "Any a time you're in the class, 50 percent of the people below you, you're in good shape."  Not only that, I was third in medical school.  So I did kind of agitate a little bit with my questions and so on.  (Unclear) and so on.  So--but Dr. Ross was one conservative man.
Speaker 1: Now he was the head of the heart clinic?
Speaker 2: No, head of OB/Gyn [obstetrics/gynecology].
Speaker 1: OB Gyn.
Speaker 2: Dr. Charles Drew was head of the hospital (unclear).  He liked me a lot.  He said, I could have a residence surgery if I ever wanted.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I didn't want surgery. And not only a doctor in psychiatry named Hope.  He went to school with the chairman of Howard [University] of--when he was an undergraduate.  He was a man who became head of the department in OB [obstetrics] at Howard.  He said, he'd couldn't take me this year.  He'd take me next year.  I didn't wanna wait that long.  And he was also just OB,  I wanted both.  So I did feel good.  I had a lot of people on my side.
Speaker 1: Now you said the first choice of Dr. Ross was Dr. Steptoe.  Right?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Frank Lloyd. He turned out to be--he was really my partner.  A schoolmate.  But he had learned how to handle--he had more women voting for him to get the thing than me.  He convinced Dr. Ross that I was young and can wait.  But I had to--Frank's dead now.  Frank did a tremendous job in Indianapolis [Indiana].  And he was well known for his work in Indianapolis.  I can't think of the hospital.  A big hospital he became head of, yeah.  So I probably wouldn't have made it--became a head if I didn't have--work with Dr. Jason with the dean who appointed me.  Funny thing.  His first choice is Steptoe.  But I did such a good job, Steptoe came back for a job later.  And Dr. Dean Jason said he had to come under me (laughs).  I never heard another word from Steptoe.  But I can sometimes (unclear) friends at Cook County.  He was chairman at Cook County [Hospital, Chicago, Ilinois] at one time.  He went to Northwestern [University] undergraduate.  He's dead now.  He taught (unclear) was his last thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Alright.  Now so you were eventually selected to be the head of OB/Gyne.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I made some radical changes.  At that time I only had three people.  He only had three people for residents.  I think it was wrong. We need (unclear).  I increased the residents from three to thirty.  That's when you had to get other hospitals for patient training.  First attack was DC General [Hospital, Washington D.C.].  When I was at--would go to DC General--City Hospital, it was like you were going to (unclear).  You couldn't touch, you couldn't talk.  I said, "This is ridiculous."  So I took the District government on and told them, "I must have part of the patient load from DC General."  Georgetown and George Washington fought me hard.  Decided I was too young.  I just said, "Ridiculous."  I said, "As far as I'm concerned, I have just as much authority as you do."  George Washington, Georgetown.
Speaker 1: George Washington who?  What was his last name?
Speaker 2: George Washington Medical school.
Speaker 1: George Washington Medical okay.
Speaker 2: And Georgetown [University] Medical school.
Speaker 1: Georgetown.  Okay.
Speaker 2: They had all the patients.
Speaker 1: All the patients from DC General Hospital that you would be--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So you're fighting to get those--your share of the patients.
Speaker 2: I want--to be-wanna share.  I got the one share.  Boy, George Washington got so upset they could only stand me for a figurehead and  left and went out to Virginia.  I also increased DC General and (unclear) whatever.  I think it's on the Southeast.  (Unclear).  I had residents there.  I had residents in Norfolk [Virginia] and the rest at Trinity  and Providence Catholic Hospital.  So that's why I was able to increase the number from three to 30.  All the time I was in charge, we had the accreditation.
Story_ID: 5066
Speaker 1: After the war [World War II] a lot of the black soldiers came back.  People who had served as officers or higher-ups and they wanted to go to medical school.  And there are only a couple places they can go.  Right?  To Meharry [Medical College], Howard [University School of Medicine], and--.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: In those days that's about it.  They might be able to get into another one but--.
Speaker 2: Well they could--they were (unclear) at Ohio State and Michigan too.  So about three or four.  What's unique about Michigan, they didn't take undergraduates from Michigan.  The boys from Michigan came from Wayne [State University] and Morehouse [College].
Speaker 1: That's interesting.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I never did understand that.  Well, I understand it in a way.  But if you're doing--if you're going to an  excellent school in Michigan, you seem likely to encourage your own undergraduates to get in your medical school.  But--in fact, Michigan did--one of the girls--I can't think of her name--finished number one in the class from Michigan.  And they the  number one person gives a speech.  She's a neurosurgeon now today, yeah.  She was from Flint, Michigan.  But no, I didn't (unclear) at Ohio State.  Well mainly (unclear) I did more work and my grades spoke for itself other than (unclear).  I didn't have time to joke.
Speaker 1: Now but at Howard [University School of Medicine, Washington D.C.] when you were head there, you brought on--you increased the residents from three to thirty.
Speaker 2: From three to thirty.
Speaker 1: And so your goal was to train as many black doctors as possible.  Right?
Speaker 2: --As possible as a specialist.  I did.  That's why I'm honored.  I got an end--they have an endowment for me.  I guess that I trained probably more obstetricians and gynecologists that were black than anybody there were.
Speaker 1: Now what impact has your training head on the quality of life of black women in this country?  As you said--you said before we started talking and before we got on camera that black women suffer more from infant mortality and--well I mean they--well the infants suffer too.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But the women were dying in childbirth at a higher rate because of a lack of adequate care.  Medical attention.  Right?
Speaker 2: Well, I think it's made a difference.  There is no question about it made a difference.  (Unclear) the United States think of things.  In 1970, the obstetricians and gynecologists in most big schools like Harvard [University] ans so on, the brighter students were not going in that field--in their field. So people were taking place was about say 3,000 people in training in OB/Gyn [obstetrics/gynecology], about one third of them were coming from India, Korea, England, Canada.  Out of those 3,000 , always wondering why twenty-one blacks and half of those blacks from the West Indies and so on.  Only a third from Howard--not Howard were African--.
Speaker 1: Were African American.
Speaker 2: Americans.  So I agitated the people.  I said, "It ought to be a damn shame.  Want me to--you talk about maternal death and so on.  You're not taking any action to solve the problem."  I said--next year there were 130.  I said, "I have 30 of the 130.  You're taking people India, anywhere other than American blacks.  So quite a few got it.  I walked out of the big (unclear) started taking more and so on.  So--but I thought (unclear). So if you wanna help us, train us.  And I guess I made an impression.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We only had endowed chairs--two at first.  J. B. Johnson first at Howard[University School of Medicine]  He's dead.  Charlie Drew was second endowed chair.  He dead.  And the third endowed chair John F. J. Clark.  I'm not dead yet.  And, and fourth is--that's all.  I'm the first living chair.  And so--.
Speaker 1: That's quite an honor.  Did you--what was the hardest part of trying to I guess actualize your dream at Howard for the medical school and the training of black doctors?  What was the toughest thing you had to face?
Speaker 2: The toughest thing I had to (unclear) black doctors after they trained come (unclear).  It's wonderful all these doctors trained help hospital centers, hospital center, Columbia Hospital. Fine.  All through where we couldn't leave--where we couldn't go before not a hospital would not accept a well trained obstetrician generally.  And Virginia and Maryland and so on and so on.  I feel that when (unclear) men are trained very carefully and  the hospital accepts them very well.  I can't get them to help poor Howard (unclear) since I left. That's the sad thing.
Story_ID: 5067
Speaker 1: When you look back on what you've been able to do, I mean what would you consider as your legacy at this point?
Speaker 2: As a teacher.  Evidently I was a good teacher. 'Cause I convinced so many students, where the white schools had trouble getting--in the early '70s [1970s] getting people to go into OB/Gyn [obstetrics/gynecology].  I didn't.  See that's why people--Philippines, Korean, Indians--. So evidently, I was able to convince students it was a wonderful field.  It's a sad field now.  The lawyers got us now on malpractice.  Not so much being sued, you have to pay so much.  I have a son in OB/Gyn--at one time in New York City,  I had to pay $100,000 premium for insurance.  That's more than my poor dad made in a lifetime almost.  I mean think about it.  I'm not against a doctor being sued that's wrong.  But it--man!  Lawyers hurt us so.  When you're wrong, you're wrong.  But when you think about you have to make $100,000 before you take any food home, it's--and malpractice now is quite a problem all over the country.  But obstetricians, neurosurgeons and orthopedic people I don't know what's the answer.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.  Now you've been involved in the Civil Rights Movement here in--.
Speaker 2: Ha?
Speaker 1: You've been involved in the Civil Rights Movement here on some levels in DC.
Speaker 2: Yes, in a way in a medical way really.  Integrating the medical society, integrating the hospitals--the March of Dimes for example.  The March of Dimes used to directly give all the money to Children's Hospital all the time.  I said, "That's wrong.  If you do it citywide--." So, the man from New York made me chairman.  So I gave the money to the DC General [Hospital, Washington D.C.] for projects for a while.  And when I quit being chairman, Georgetown [University Medical School] took over.  But I think--I'm not against Children's Hospital.  But it was always one-sided thing.  And I was very glad to help in doctors being sued as an expert and so on.  I think (unclear).  What I did when [Ronald W.] Reagan came to be President, he ripped a lot of people.  I guess he tied up the air [traffic] controllers and so on.  And they're caught without insurance.  Some.  So I sent a DC government government give free living, free care and that's why be District government honored me.  In Columbia Hospital and (unclear) hospital center did help this (unclear) .
Speaker 1: Now you published a great deal too.
Speaker 2: Well yeah.
Speaker 1: I see a list of about a hundred publications or more.
Speaker 2: I tried to (unclear) helped (unclear) I did adolescent and teenage pregnancy.  I came to the conclusion it was a problem with education.  Because even here in Washington [D.C.], where abortion is illegal, but it still a problem of education.  And I see recently, teenage pregnancy in the United States has gone down.  I gave a talk to the International College about teenage pregnancy and so on.  And then the other subject I worked is things kill you if you if they don't diagnose ectopic pregnancy and abdominal pregnancy.  That's where the pregnancy doesn't get where it's supposed to go.  So I wrote quite a bit on that.
Story_ID: 5068
Speaker 1: Have the problems of black women changed over the years in terms of what a major problem with these days?  Or----?
Speaker 2: Yes it's improved some.  But still not a lack of prenatal care, earlier detection can take it down.  The same with knowing more about diabetes.  Diabetes is a blight on black men and women and so on.  And it's very important for you to learn how to eat and what to do.  We used to think having a baby that weighed nine and ten pounds.  When you investigate, t they were probably pre-diabetic.  And I weighed nine pounds.  I--well I'm black.  We don't realize how important it is to find out whether you're a diabetic. And I'm diabetic, hypertensive, had a stroke.  But I think one thing has helped me,  I stopped drinking milk.  Now your dairy (unclear).  But my mother loved milk. Coming from the country and so on.  But in 1943, I  stopped milk because of diarrhea--lactose intolerance.  I didn't know that then. But the ice cream, milk heats the vessels.  They won't talk about it.  But cream all this, bad.
Speaker 1: Not good for you.  You're saying so (unclear).
Speaker 2: No.  The ice cream and the--But anyway, I can't attack that now.  But I think that's helped me not to have a heart attack.  Because I can't eat cheese.  I can't drink milk.  Predisposed to I think in the arteries.
Speaker 1: (pause) Okay.  What are some of your hopes and concerns for the black community today?
Speaker 2: Oh I have a lot.  I just finished--I may try to get my book published.  I just finished it.  A memorial from Clark from West Virginia to Washington DC.  I've met with Presidents--emphasizing how important Truman was in my life.  Made the military acceptable.  That's why you see these black generals.  They all bless [President Harry] Truman. Why Truman did it, I don't--well I know why he did it.  But it turns out to be a good thing.  'Cause Colin Powell (unclear) Charge of Westmont (unclear). The last thing I'm gonna tell you about me is that the Army was so disgusting to me when I graduated. They didn't want me.  So I--they asked me to resign, I resigned. When the war came on, they needed a career, so they passed a doctor draft and said, "If you have any type of (unclear) you had to serve. I didn't--I wasn't against serving.  I didn't wanna go back and serve the federal army.  So they sent me a telegram.  "When you receive this telegram, you're in the Army.  You're gonna be a corporal, if you don't wanna volunteer or a captain."  So I volunteered naturally.  And I went to Germany.  Had a lovely time.  Learned the people (unclear).  I was the first black to be in a German hospital.  The women was nice to me.  When I left, the foreign people came to see me off leaving Germany. So I do appreciate what Truman did as a person.  And it made my impression on the military (unclear).  It's the only real integrated society in the country now.  The Navy, the Army.  So (unclear).  After we get this book published, I'm gonna talk about the mountains I had to climb.  And one mountain was dyslexia.  I'm gonna put down what I did and help--might help other people with dyslexia.  I don't wanna feel ashamed. Since I know all the [Albert] Einstein, [Winston] Churchill, [Woodrow] Wilson was dyslexic.  And other mountain was my stroke.  About what to eat.  You're too fat and so on and so on, and so on.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Now what--?
Speaker 2: And very fortunate.  And nothing wrong with my mind.  I do have trouble talking at times.  But I remember quite detailed.  And I'm talking about the stroke.  The last mountain I'm trying to climb is racism.  And I--and I'm glad I was born in West Virginia.  'Cause I saw a small amount of racism was too harsh.  I can't stand a picnic today.  You know why?  I drove through the South and I could only get out and eat at a picnic and I couldn't stop anywhere.  Mother didn't want us to be embarrassed.  I got sick of picnics.  So I can say personally I can't stand a picnic. That's why I can't.  So those things I think I hurt--not reached the mountaintop.  And I think I fought racism here in the District [of Columbia, Washington D.C.]  to integrate the hospitals for the residents.  Trained more people and so on.  And the other thing really I tried to convince Howard [University].  I talk too much at times.  So it's very difficult for an old man to go in a new man's try and lead their program.  So I stand back (unclear).  But I think it should be something for the prison situation.  Almost half the prison population is black.  Educators have to face the prison system--
Story_ID: 5069
Speaker 1: You were talking about the prison system.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Prison system.
Speaker 1: What are your concerns--?
Speaker 2: Well it's the most rapid growing population of the prison section are women. And they're black women.  And so I think--well I haven't been able to convince Howard [University] they should be involved some where in the prison system.  The education more.  You're looking for your infectious diseases or looking for carcinoma of the cervix, cancer of the cervix.  They think it's an infectious disease, we can learn more about that.  You can help the women.  You don't have to worry--trying to worry about where you're gonna find them next week.  'Cause they'll be in prison.  I think a school like Howard could do something about education.  [Benjamin] Banneker [Academic High School. Washington D.C.] here is the--what?  The honors school.  It's one door from Howard.  They send 100 percent of their kids to college.  Banneker does.  And I think seeing young doctors, young men and women, come down there help tutor or help by being--to see you as a role model would be wonderful.  And I think Howard should carry it one step further.  I think these--not force teach it---all young college kids about health (unclear), foods they're eating and things like that.  We're so behind on nutrition. We're making too many fat people.  I think (unclear).  And I told them nobody want to-Well I didn't say that.  But I think there are some things that you can do in the future with the health education (unclear).
Speaker 1: You think there are too many big people now?  I mean they're--?
Speaker 2: I don't know.  I probably might be reaching there.  You know, I have to be careful.  I get so involved.  I don't want another stroke.  So maybe I'll reach somebody listening.  You know, everybody loves [President Bill] Clinton.  Well I love Clinton I guess.  But Clinton has put more black people in prison than anybody.
Speaker 1: Hmm.  That is true.
Speaker 2: 'Cause what he's done is leave the economic--you put a prison in a little rural suburban community needs money.  And those people are using (unclear).  A book on the-Randall wrote, Robinson wrote on this.  Now nobody want to talk about it.  It was actually a second (unclear) slavery.  The prison system.

They aren't a bit more concerned are animals.  Using animals.  They were poor people.  And the right--people-animal lovers were not always (unclear).  Yes, that's why these large-The city hospitals were very important.  Train (unclear). Doctors had to train on somebody.  LA County does 30,000 (unclear) a year.  Look at all that experience.

And when you're (unclear) do you have the control when you are a young resident and wanna operate."
Speaker 1: Now some people have casually observed--Not--I don't mean their attitude.  But just generally observed that a lot of their friends-a lot of young women in the '90's had hysterectomies.  I mean a lot of black women all of a sudden were having a lot of hysterectomies.  Right.

Speaker 1: I personally know of five.  And I never heard of that before.  Is this-What was going on in the '90's [1990s]that was causing all these hysterectomies?  I mean-and it may still be going on.

She was not gonna get a uterine out 'cause her husband worked in a big packing company there (unclear) or something.  And the man kept saying (unclear).  He said, "Look liked a twenty-year-old."  Yeah.  She had twenty-year old money behind her.  So I laughed.  And said, "Well I knew what he was saying to me."

I was in the hospital--one hospital observing.  And I heard (unclear) hospital-I had the money to stay in a hotel.  But it was a Catholic hospital.  I can't--they moved out to a suburban.  And (unclear) and the woman died.  She had an ectopic [pregnancy].  The boy came over, "Well mister, she was too fat."  I said, "Fat people don't like to die."  And made an effort.
