 Finchum Today is August 19, 2016. My name is Tanya Finchum. I   m with Oklahoma State University. Today I am in Sallisaw, Oklahoma, which is in Sequoyah County, and this is to interview Karen Robbins as part of our Cowboys in Every County project. Thank you for having me today.  Robbins Thanks for coming.  Finchum Let   s learn a little bit about you, beginning with when and where you were born.  Robbins I was actually born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, on Valentine   s Day, February 14, 1953, at a hospital that   s not even there anymore. The ACH Hospital in Shawnee, Oklahoma, sixty-three years ago.  Finchum On Valentine   s Day.  Robbins On Valentine   s Day, yes.  Finchum Did they do anything special for your mother?  Robbins No, but they really   my mom and dad tell the story. They really debated on naming me Valerie or Valentine, or something like that, but they didn   t. Thank goodness, I   m glad they didn   t. (Laughs) It   s been a very fun birthday. People don   t forget very often. It   s not like being Christmas that you have to share it with some major holiday. It   s a romantic holiday, but it   s a fun birthday. People don   t forget very often.  Finchum You get candy for sure on your birthday.  Robbins Yes, that   s right, and flowers, usually. (Laughter) 5  Finchum Were you an only child, or brothers and sisters?  Robbins No, I have two sisters, one a year older and one a year younger. My sister, Lynn, is thirteen months older than me and lives in Oklahoma City. Then I have a sister, Beth, that is eighteen months younger than me, and she actually lives in Stillwater.  Finchum Neat, three of you...  Robbins Three girls.  Finchum    and you   re in the middle?  Robbins Instead of    My Three Sons,    we have    My Three Daughters.    My dad said he could   ve tried ten more times, and probably would   ve had ten more girls, so he just quit. (Laughter)  Finchum And what did he do for a living?  Robbins He was in the savings and loan business. I think our whole OSU heritage was based probably on him. He was an avid OSU fan, and was president of the Alumni Association. We were trying to figure out before you came. I talked to my mom, she   s still living, my dad is not still living, but he got Alumni of the Year, and we can   t figure out   we have a picture, but we can   t see the year that it was on the picture. He was president of the Alumni Association    82,    83. It was sometime after that that he got Alumni of the Year.  My daughter   we were talking about stories last night, and she said she actually can remember being there at that ceremony. It was in the Student Union. Anyway, he was in the savings and loan business his whole life. Dad, he went to OSU out of high school and actually was a walk-on for Coach Iba to play basketball. He said he was just a grunt, kind of wrenched out the team, but he always talked about, they all call him, Mr. Iba, how much he respected him, and how he really influenced his life. Then the war came in there, and I can   t   I know we   ve talked about it but don   t really remember all the details, but Dad had to go.  He went for a few years, and then came back and finished at OSU, but towards the end of his OSU time, his dad got real sick. His dad had the savings and loan business in Shawnee before him, so he left college, and his professors and people at school helped him to finish. He lacked one semester, and he had to go, and take over the savings and loan from his dad. He was a business major, and so just really out of college. My mom is from Shawnee also, but they didn   t date until OSU. They dated there and then got 6  married. She never finished, she never got her degree, she left before she got her degree.  Finchum And what was she majoring in, probably home ec. or education?  Robbins Yes, I think something like that. Probably getting a husband, I don   t know, she   d kill me for saying that. She never said, I don   t know. I need to ask her that, I don   t know what her major was.  Finchum And what were their names?  Robbins Nancy and Haylor Fisher. Fisher was my maiden name.  Finchum Just F-I-S-H-E-R?  Robbins H-E-R. Yes, and his name was H-A-Y-L-O-R, Haylor. It   s a real unusual name. His dad   s name was Haylor, and he was Junior, Haylor Hillman Fisher Junior. I have a picture actually of his dad and him. His dad had the first automobile in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and there were pictures in the paper of that. He was a Purdue grad, his dad, so I don   t really know. I never heard the story on how Daddy got so enamored with OSU, but even   they have in Shawnee one of the biggest, biggest things. He was a Kiwanian, and one of their big things is they put on what they call the Little Olympics. He was the starter for all the races on the track and field, and he always wore an orange coat. They actually have it in the museum in Shawnee, this coat that Daddy always wore.  He even   I don   t know if they still do it, but they used to wear orange jackets as president of the Alumni Association, but he had that one too. He had two of them. The one, his starting jacket, it didn   t have OSU on it, and then his OSU jacket that he wore, of course, about like Coach Budke, anytime we played OU or he went to an OSU event. He was the basis. We, all three of us girls, are graduates of OSU. My sister, Beth, has two girls, and my sister Lynn has a daughter and a son, and I have a daughter and a son, they   re all OSU graduates. Then my son went to OSU Medical School and is a general surgeon at OSU Medical Center in Tulsa, so it   s just all in our blood and     Finchum Did they have a choice of going there or somewhere?  Robbins You know, maybe? (Laughs) I don   t think if it had been OU, it probably   we might not have paid for it. My daughter, the one that you   ll get to talk to later, she looked at Baylor a little bit. We took her down there, and she looked at Baylor a little bit, but her heart just wasn   t in it. When that   s all they   ve known, they feel comfortable there. We went there a lot for games and different activities. Stephanie was even saying she remembered, and I 7  didn   t remember this until we talked about it last night. When she was a junior in high school, I don   t even know if they still do this, but they recognized outstanding juniors and brought them to OSU, I guess to try and get them interested in going to college there. She got to go with two other students from Sallisaw. I don   t really remember, are they still doing that?  Finchum I think they still do.  Robbins You think they still do that, but she said that really made an impact on her. It   s just in our blood. We love it, and have had season tickets for forever. I know a lot of people make sacrifices to go to games and different sporting events, but you drove here today. It   s not an easy drive to go up there and come back in one day for a football game, or a basketball game, or something like that. It   s a pretty big commitment. I think there   s probably a lot of places in Oklahoma it   s like that. For years, we   ve sat by some people at the football games who were big OSU fans and lived in Oklahoma. Then he got transferred to Houston, and they would drive up to football games from Houston.  Finchum That   s a little   .  Robbins It is a long trip, but it   s amazing how dedicated I think OSU fans are, and loving, and caring, and giving. We   ve maintained contact with those people in Houston. We send Christmas cards, and their kids are grown-up. We knew them when they had little bitty ones, and we had little bitty ones, so it   s been fun.  Finchum Let   s back up. When did you graduate from high school?  Robbins I graduated from high school in 1971.  Finchum Then started OSU     Robbins Immediately.  Finchum    the fall of    71?  Robbins Yes, and that   s kind of an interesting story. I didn   t really know what I wanted to do, was leaning towards nursing. Of course, OSU at that time did not have a nursing program, and my dad was all about us girls getting degrees. I actually think OSU might have had maybe like an associate degree or an LPN program or something in Oklahoma City. Maybe it was just   I really don   t remember because my dad wasn   t   we weren   t going to do that. I was going to have a degree. My freshman year I pretty much decided that   s what I wanted to do, and we started looking at where I was going to go, and what I was going to do, and how I was going to pursue it. 8  At that time, about the only nursing program was at OU, and of course that was a very hard pill for any of us to swallow because I really wasn   t   but I really, really wanted to be a nurse.  I applied and got accepted, and about April of the year that I was going to start in the fall, there was budget cuts in the state legislature. OU said they were not going to take any transfers from any other school. They would only take the nursing students that were already enrolled at OU. It was going to be summer, and I didn   t know where I was going to go. We started doing some research, and TU  University of Tulsa  had just started a nursing program. My mom was trying to help me with it because I was going to school and in class. She called, and the secretary at TU graduated with my mom from high school. They knew each other, and she pulled some strings and got me in TU. I transferred from OSU to TU after my sophomore year, and then I graduated with a degree in nursing from TU.  Finchum Not OU?  Robbins I mean, unfortunately, I don   t really claim TU. I probably should, I got a great education there and have been able to be a nurse for a lot of years and enjoyed that. I still say I   m an OSU grad, (laughs) although my degree   s from TU.  Finchum You went two years, that counts.  Robbins That   s right, and all my kids, all my money went there, so you think that   s got to count for something, right? (Laughs)  Finchum Where did you live while you were at OSU?  Robbins I lived my freshman year in Kerr-Drummond, and then I pledged a sorority, and I moved to   I was an Alpha Chi Omega, and I moved to the Alpha Chi house my sophomore year and lived there my whole sophomore year. That   s a whole wonderful experience too. I know it   s not for everybody, but when you   re from a smaller town, and you don   t know a lot of people, and you go to a college, it gives you a group of people to be a part of, that you recognize when you walk across campus. And you have people looking after you and giving you advice on how to do things when you don   t know a lot of people. It was a great experience for me.  Finchum During that year, did you have to pomp?  Robbins Yes, we did, (Laughs) and did Spring Sing, and what was the other one besides Spring Sing   there   s one in the fall, and one in the   .  Finchum There   s a Revue, something Revue. 9  Robbins I look back   and of course my kids were both, one of them was in a fraternity and one of them was in a sorority, and they did all that. You watch them and you think,    How do you do all that? How did we do that?    No sleep, and trying to study and keep your grades up, and have to do the hours you have to do with all of that. Then you look back, and it   s such a great memory. There   s so much camaraderie, and you get to know people in other houses, fraternities, and you probably get to know your sisters better. Everybody stays up half the night putting those little things in the chicken wire. (Laughs) Now, it   s changed so much. We always try to go to Walkaround, and how they do all the shading and looking 3D, and we didn   t   it is amazing  We didn   t do any of that. It was just pretty basic.  It was back then just like it is now. The AGRs  Alpha Gamma Rho  were always the best. You always wanted to be with them because they were so good at it, but it was a great, fun experience. Just how excited you get about Homecoming, and what such a major production it is, and everybody being together and cheering. Then you go to the game, and you all sit together, and you find out who wins. It   s just great memories. When I was at OSU though, football was not very good. I can remember going to some games, but I know today, like my kids being there, they never missed a game. It wasn   t as big a deal when I was at OSU as it is now.  I do remember my sister, Lynn, she was a sophomore when I was a freshman. I don   t even know what made us decide to do it, but we took a bus to an OSU-Kansas football game. They picked us up at like six o   clock in the morning at the dorms, I think in the dorm parking lot, and you got on this bus, and I think we stopped and ate lunch somewhere. I think we were going to like Manhattan. We went to the game, and everybody sat together. They had gotten us tickets, and then you got back on the bus, and we came back to OSU. It was a fun, fun time, but I don   t know that I   d do it now. (Laughs) It was a long day, but it was a fun time. I don   t remember that as a major memory from my time at OSU, the football, and basketball even wasn   t as big a deal then as it is now. As an adult, we go all the time. I think we   re here, we   re making all this effort, and we didn   t do it that much when I was there.  Finchum Had other priorities, I guess.  Robbins Yes, I guess. I don   t know.  Finchum Well, and with your dad having played, I   m surprised you didn   t   .  Robbins Basketball was always a bigger deal than football because he had played basketball. As a matter of fact, my mom and dad lived in Shawnee forever, their whole lives. In about probably fifteen years, twenty maybe, my dad 10  had pretty bad diabetes and heart disease, and had to have one leg amputated. They still had season tickets to the basketball games, and he wasn   t driving anymore, and my mom would drive them. It   s twice a week during basketball season, and she finally said,    Haylor, I just can   t keep driving that road.    It   s a two-lane between Shawnee and Stillwater. They decided to move to Stillwater, so they could continue   I have a sister that lives there, so that made a difference too.  Then he ended up having to have the other leg amputated, so it was a really good move because my sister was there. They were able to continue going to all the basketball games because they moved. They now live in Stillwater, or she does, my dad is not living. Anyway, it was hard for   I think it was harder for him to move there than it was for her because he was so active in the Kiwanis. Men would come get him and take him places, and then he didn   t   moved to Stillwater and didn   t really have any friends. The Alumni Association was good. They would include him in Alumni Association meetings, and I served on the Alumni Board for four years. I would go up for meetings, and go pick him up and take him to the meetings. Then they also had   they   re building some kind of an assisted living     Finchum The Ranch?  Robbins    in Stillwater. Is that what it   s called, I couldn   t even remember what it was called.  Finchum It   s finally getting off the ground, ground-breaking.  Robbins He   s been gone five or six years, but before he died, they asked him to serve on a committee that was trying to decide what they needed and what it was going to look like. It was pretty much, I think, in the planning stages, so it   s been planned for   .  Finchum Seems like about ten years, doesn   t it?  Robbins Yeah, that   s probably about right because I think he served on that two or three years before he died.  Finchum I think it   s actually broke ground.  Robbins It was good, it   s just nice that we take care of our own, I think. They knew it was harder for him to get around, so people would come pick him up. He made new friends there, but I think it was always harder for him. My mom has done very, very well. Met a lot of new people, and she lives in assisted living now, but people have been really good to her there.  Finchum They both had a closet full of orange? 11  Robbins Yes, still do, still do. (Laughs) She does. We   re all pretty avid fans. My sister, Beth, that lives in Stillwater, she   s married to an OU grad. He   s the only one in the family, and he will not be around us when there   s a football game. When OU-OSU plays, he goes to one house, and all the rest of us are at another house. I was telling Steph and my husband last night, one of my greatest memories, or saddest memories, or baddest memories was when I still lived in Shawnee, and I guess I was in high school, probably, or maybe junior high. We played OU, and we got beat sixty-six to six, and we     Finchum Football?  Robbins    in football, and I was devastated. I   m highly competitive, so it   s very, very hard for me, and especially to ever get beat by OU. (Laughs) Somebody got spray paint, and spray painted it on our sidewalk and  that score  in the front of our house. Big, big letters, like three-foot or so   numbers. (Laughs) I told Steph and Rick, I cried, and cried, and cried. I didn   t want to go to school. It took forever for that to come off that sidewalk. Is that not   people are just not very nice, but we aren   t very nice sometimes when we win either. Anyway, a lot of your memories, I think, have to do with sports and people you meet along the way.  A girl from here in Sallisaw went to OSU and dated, who was then-center, Tony Wilkins, OSU football player. He played with Coach Gundy, and Barry Sanders, and Hart Lee Dykes, and what   s the other runner, gosh, my mind just went blank. Anyway, Hal was probably four or five, my son, avid OSU fan, avid sports fan, was at all the games. Tony asked Hal to go in the locker room with him, and he had gotten him a program and had them all sign it, and    I   ll take you in there, and introduce you to all of them.    He got scared and would not go. We still give him a hard time about that thinking,    Why, you had a chance of a lifetime, and you would not do that.    He would not go in that locker room with Tony Wilkins, but if he had it would   ve been a great experience if he had ever said,    I could   ve met all those people,    but he didn   t ever go. Now, he regrets it. (Laughs)  Finchum Your sister Beth, when did she graduate from OSU?  Robbins She graduated   she was one year behind me, so she graduated from high school in    72, so she would   ve graduated in    76.  Finchum With what area?  Robbins Business, yes.  Finchum Then the other sister?  12  Robbins She graduated one year before me, so she would   ve been    74, and she   s education. She   s a teacher in Oklahoma City. She teaches at a private Catholic school, she   s actually a librarian. Then my sister, Beth, is CFO at Meridian Technology. She used to be president of Stillwater Bank. I think it went under.  Finchum It switched names. I   m not sure what it is now, but I think it switched names.  Robbins Yes, anyway, but now she   s CFO at Meridian Technology, and she loves it.  Finchum When did you meet your husband? Was he from   .  Robbins No, he   s not. He grew up in Stilwell, Oklahoma, which is thirty minutes from here, up the road. He went to Northeastern School, went to medical school at Kirksville. He   s in family practice here in Sallisaw. I went to TU and graduated from nursing school, and at Kirksville   . OSU Medical School, you do rotations in the state of Oklahoma, go to different hospitals, and you   re going to practice with different doctors in the state. In Kirksville, they had so many doctors all over the nation that you do your rotations all around. At that time, OSU Medical Center was Oklahoma Osteopathic Hospital  OOH , and that was one of their rotations. OSU didn   t have a medical school yet, so they didn   t have any students.  He rotated to Tulsa because his family was from Stilwell, and he was thinking about coming back here, so he wanted some experience in Oklahoma. He rotated here, and I had actually just graduated from nursing school and taken the boards when he started his rotation. I think it was like June. I had a job, was going to go to work in Denver. I really thought I wanted to become a pediatric nurse practitioner, and I was going to work at the Children   s Hospital in Denver, Colorado, but I had to wait until I got my nursing boards back. I was working at what was then OOH because I   d done a rotation there. We met, our first date was Fourth of July. We got engaged in August and married in December.  Finchum Wow   Robbins The night we got engaged, I had an orange Volkswagen. We called it the Cowboy Mobile. The night we got engaged, he was working twelve-noon to twelve-midnight, I think or something, and he walked me out to the car. I got off at eleven, I was working three to eleven, and he asked me to marry him out there, and gave me the ring. On my way home, a car ran a red light and hit me, totaled my car, fractured my skull, broke all my ribs, so I was in the hospital for, I don   t know, two or three weeks. He had to call my mom and dad, and they didn   t know we were engaged. They had barely met him. They were not very happy about it, (laughs) and they walked in the room, and I held up my hand. 13  They took him to dinner that night and gave him the degree. We   ve been married since 1975, so    85,    95, 2005, 200   forty-one years. This year, it   ll be forty-one years, so it was meant to be, I think, but they really had a hard time because it happened so fast. Just sometimes you know it   s the right thing, but he is an avid OSU fan now. His family were all   he was raised, pretty much, an OU fan. I think a lot of people in Oklahoma, if they didn   t go to school one or the other, they are more OU-leaned instead of OSU because they win more than we do. Anyway, he grew up an OU fan, but now he   s an avid OSU fan. He probably gets more excited than I do, and that   s saying something. His blood is now orange also, so it   s great.      Finchum You   ve been     Robbins Married forty-one years.  Finchum    married forty-one years, and you have two children?  Robbins Two children.  Finchum A boy and a girl, and they both went to OSU.  Robbins They both went to OSU. My daughter married an Arkansas boy, and he   s a big Arkansas fan. They were both in ministry. Lived in   she met him in Conway,  Arkansas  they were doing K-Life Ministry, and got married, and he   s a big Arkansas fan. They did ministry for their first couple years of marriage, and then decided that they wanted to move away from that. She decided to go back and get her master   s, so she actually got her master   s from University of Arkansas. She went there and was in a program where they let her work, and they let her have free tuition while she was working, so     Finchum Hard to turn that down.  Robbins     they lived there for a while. Had my first grandbaby up there, they did, but she has a master   s from University of Arkansas, but a degree from OSU. She now teaches at Carl Albert, teaches comp I and II, and creative writing, and then a remedial reading class, here in Sallisaw. They live here in Sallisaw now. Her husband is a policeman, and he   s actually the resource officer for the Sallisaw Schools. His degree   s in education, so it   s a real good fit for him. He   s really good at it. My son married a girl from Arkansas too. My daughter and son-in-law introduced them. She was in ministry too. He   s an OSU physician in surgery, a surgeon.  He is the   whatever they call it, liaisons between OSU and surgery, or director of students, or something. He heads up the student surgery 14  department with the students at OSU. He teaches a little bit, and then he comes here one day a week, and does surgery on Tuesday mornings. Then sees patients in our office on Tuesday afternoons. It   s a good fit, and he loves coming back here, and seeing people he knew growing up. It   s great for a small community hospital to be able to offer surgery to people, where they don   t have to drive an hour, hour and a half away, and then have to get back in the car and come home after you   ve had surgery. It   s been a good fit for him, and I think a good fit for our hospital also.  Finchum Plus, he gets to see Mom.  Robbins That   s right. He used to come and spend the night, but now he has four children, and my daughter has four children. They   re pretty busy with families, and don   t have a whole lot of time to get away.  Finchum Then maybe half of those will go to OSU.  Robbins Hopefully, I   m having to fight my son-in-law, the one that lives here in town. He wants all his to go to Arkansas, but that   s out-of-state tuition, so maybe I   ll have a little pull there. (Laughs) I hope so. Those four are big Arkansas fans, but my son   s four, they   re big OSU fans.  Finchum As long as they go somewhere, I guess.  Robbins That   s right, go to college. That   s what you got to pray.  Finchum Would you go to campus for like Mom   s Day, and Parents    Day?  Robbins Yes. Always was there for Mom   s Day, even Dad   s Day. Dad   s Day is always for a football game, and so we   d go, and he   d spend the time with the daughter and son. Usually moms and daughters go shopping, so we   d always go shopping and take care of everybody. Yeah, it was fun, and always try to do Spring Sing. I think it was Mom   s Day usually in the spring, I think, usually they had that around that time, Spring Sing. That was always fun. My kids both sang, so they were always in that, and that was always a fun time.      Finchum We were talking about visiting campus as a parent. What about graduation for both of them? Do you remember any details about that?  Robbins Yes, they both walked. Stephanie graduated in the actual springtime. The neatest thing I can remember about that was   you know how they video them walking down whatever street, is that Hall of Fame, Hester or whatever, yes. She was on the big screen, and we all thought that was so cool, that we got to see her up on the big screen, walking down the street to come to graduation. Then Hal graduated, actually, in three and a half years 15  in biochemistry and molecular biology, so we were extremely proud of him. He graduated in the fall semester, December, I think it is, so it was totally different. It was held in Gallagher-Iba.  It was much smaller, so it was intimate. It was a fun time because there weren   t a lot, and in his major, I think they do it by schools or whatever. He graduated early because he wanted to work some at a hospital, and get some experience before   he had been accepted to medical school in the fall. He graduated, and then moved home, and worked at our hospital just as an orderly, but they let him do a lot of stuff back in ER. He learned really a lot, and I think it was a good experience for him as he became a physician to have done, because he gave baths, and     Finchum Did it all.  Robbins    did some of the not-so-pleasant things. Now, I think he has more respect for people who do that, and I think it was good for him.  Finchum As youngsters would you take them to games? Like were they   I don   t know if they had Pete   s Posse back when they were younger.  Robbins No, they didn   t. Like I say, we weren   t quite as good, so getting tickets weren   t as hard, but my mom and dad always had season tickets. A lot of times, if they wanted to go, Daddy would just get more tickets or whatever. Rick was talking about one game that he, and Hal, and my dad went, and he said,    There must   ve been three feet of snow on the field. We were playing Kansas.    It   s the coldest he   d ever   he said,    You could barely,    it was snowing so hard,    you could barely see the field,    and those players played. He said they left at half, but yes, we went to games.  The first one we ever took Hal to, or my dad took Hal to, he took him a lot. He got so scared when they shot the guns that Daddy said here he   d done this big deal, got him a hat, and everything and took him. Then he started to cry and wanted to go home because he didn   t like the guns. We also have been, as a family, to two Final Fours. We went to Seattle and San Antonio, I think. Is that where it was? I think and we   ve been to almost all of the bowls as a family. We have had a great experience, just the last few years.  My niece works for Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys, and the last two times we   ve gotten to play at the new Dallas Cowboys stadium, she   s gotten us a suite. We   ve been to two games and got to sit in the Dallas Cowboys suite, and I   m telling you what, that   s the way to watch football. (Laughs) That   s nice. You have all the food and drink in there and you   re sitting. Those suites are so nice because you   re down pretty close to the field. It   s not like you   re way, way up high. We   ve gotten to do a lot as a family, and most of the trips and great things we   ve gotten to do had to do with OSU. 16  Finchum Seattle, that would   ve been when Big Country was playing.  Robbins Yes, Big Country.  Finchum He   s from this county, right?  Robbins Yes, he is. From Gans, Oklahoma. You could   ve interviewed him, he would   ve been a good one for you to interview  He   s a big name. He lives, actually, I think, I   ve never seen his house, but he built a pretty big house out on the lake. He   s pretty active, I think, in the Gans community. He doesn   t do a lot here in Sallisaw.  Finchum I see him at halftime. Sometimes they   ll introduce him at basketball games.  Robbins Yeah, and the other thing is Scott Pierce. Do you remember    Toothless in Seattle?    He played in that  1994-95  Final Four, and he got his teeth knocked out in the previous game, it was New Jersey or something. When Hal was a senior in high school, he was hired as the head basketball coach in Sallisaw, so Hal got to play for Scott Pierce his senior year. It was a really, really neat experience. He was a big OSU fan, and Hal was a pretty good basketball player, so that was a great   . They got to   he   d come over here and hang out, and he wasn   t married at that time. He is now, lives in Fayetteville, they have kept in contact, but that was a neat experience too. We got to meet him and got to spend time with him. He was a fine young man.  Finchum Sports have been a good     Robbins Yes, it has been. Education too   you think about Hal and him being a physician, and Stephanie being an educator. I think they   ve provided a great education for my kids and for myself.  Finchum When you were there, did you have a favorite place on campus that you liked to spend time?  Robbins No. I drank a little bit in college. It wasn   t the Library, sorry. (Laughter) But you know there was a really good place, and we still talk about that, down on Washington, across from the AGR. How long have you been in Stillwater?  Finchum Since    96.  Robbins I think it was called The Library. It was a hamburger place, and you walked in, and you walked down the steps, and it was sunken down, and it had a big fire pit in the middle of the restaurant. They had the best hamburgers you 17  have ever eaten in your life. It   s not there, they tore it down. Then they had a place called the Gray Fox, which was where everybody went to drink beer. (Laughs) We spent quite a bit of time there. (Laughs) Oh my gosh, I look back and think,    What was I thinking?    I think I drank too much when I was in college. I don   t drink now. (Laughs)  Finchum You would attend dances, I would think, with being in a sorority?  Robbins Yes. I was thinking back, a guy that   I met a guy that I thought I was going to marry, that I didn   t, when I was at OSU. I was thinking about that, how they did the sororities and fraternities. Do they still do that? Like a date night or Coke night, or I can   t even remember what they called it, but you would line up. It was a pledge class of a sorority with a pledge class of a fraternity, and they lined you up by height. The shortest person got the shortest person, and I was always the tallest, so I was always the very end of the line. I met a guy on one of those. I dated him the whole time I was at OSU, and even my first year that I was at TU, and then we ended up breaking up.  There   s a lot of those kind of things. It wasn   t like it was   when my kids were in school, they did a lot of kind of major, maybe two or three each, I guess, fraternity or sorority would have a major dance. They would go away and stay in a hotel. The guys, if it was a fraternity thing, not together, but they would get the girls a room, and they   d go on a bus away, but ours weren   t that major. It was always right on campus, and you didn   t ever   I can   t ever remember driving anywhere.  Finchum Did you have a housemother, or a couple, or is it just a woman?  Robbins Yes. Well, I just lived in the Alpha Chi house one year because I transferred to TU, so I don   t remember her name. I remember more Hal and Stephanie   s housemothers, because you keep in contact with them when your kids are there. I don   t remember her name, I don   t remember who it was, but we did have a housemother.  Finchum How would you do meals, mealtime?  Robbins They have a big dining room   in the house, you mean? They have a big dining room, and they always set the tables. We always talk about it   s not really reality in the sorority house because you have people that work for the sorority, and they pick up the plates. You don   t have to clean the kitchen or anything, but you do have to have manners. You had formal dinner on Monday nights, and then the other meals, they give you a time, and you have to eat during that time. If you don   t eat at that time, they always had like peanut butter, or bagels, or something out that you could eat if you couldn   t make it to the dinnertime. 18  It was always in   you have this formal dining room that had tables like this that they had set, and you   d go in and sit down. On formal dinner night, you always   they really worked on teaching you manners and good etiquette. If you sat with the housemother, they teach you how to take from the right, and pass to the left, and how the forks are supposed to be. My mom was   I guess because she had been in a sorority when she was at OSU, she was a stickler for all that anyway. She made us learn that growing up, so that wasn   t real hard for me, but it was fun.  Finchum Did you go back and forth home very much those two years?  Robbins I did, I don   t think a lot though. We only had one car, my sisters and I shared a car. Back then, you didn   t have cell phones. We were able to call home once a week, and we called collect on Sunday nights. When we were all three there, we needed to be together, so we could all talk, and I think that was pretty expensive, so we got to call. It wasn   t like today, when you talk to your family everyday on the phone or whatever. I don   t think we   we did go home, but it was more for if you had a long weekend.  I think my mom and dad would come up to OSU for football games, so sometimes they were there for that. No, I don   t think we went home a lot. I don   t think it is like it is today. Of course my kids didn   t come home a whole lot either when they were at OSU. They   re so busy, like you said, with doing the pomp and getting ready for different activity things that they have to do, playing in intramural sports. I don   t remember doing that either. I don   t know if they had intramurals. I   m sure they probably did when I was there, but I don   t remember doing that.  Finchum At holiday time, like Thanksgiving and Christmas, did you have any family traditions that involved OSU or anything like that?  Robbins Just if OSU   not so much my family, my mom and dad, my two sisters, and I. A lot of times, when my kids were growing up, if OSU was going to a bowl, that was part of the holiday tradition. That was something they got as a Christmas gift, we would go. We always made plans to go and attend it. Of course you have OSU ornaments on your tree and I have the, I don   t know if you   ve seen them, O-S-U yard  decorations ? They make the O-S-U, the snowman, the Santa Claus, and elf is what mine are.  They were some of the first ones that were made. Mom and Dad gave it to me for Christmas one year, and I still have them. They   re looking really bad. I need to get new ones, but not anything more than just trying to get to a bowl game or attend something. A lot of times, they have an exhibition or some OSU basketball game, and if it would be in Tulsa, sometimes they   d do one   they   ve done them before at ORU, that we try to go to over 19  Christmas break or something, but not any big OSU tradition, like doing a meal or something. (Laughs)  Finchum Whole tree orange?  Robbins No, we don   t do that. I do have OSU ornaments, quite a few, and I love them, but not the whole tree. (Laughs)  Finchum Do you know the alma mater, or do you have to read it?  Robbins Yes, I think you read it when you   re singing it, so then you don   t really   I know it   s    loyal, and true,    or whatever. (Laughs) If you hadn   t asked me right this second, I might have come up with all of it.  Finchum    Herald your fame    or something.  Robbins    To our alma mater, OSU.    I can   t think of it right now. (Laughs) Yes, you would think I would as many times as I sang it at OSU football games.  Finchum You   d be surprised how many can   t, so I read it.  Robbins Yes, you do read it because it   s up there, so then you don   t put it to memory, I guess. No, if I could maybe come up with the first line   I can   t come up with it right now. I   m sixty-three. (Laughs) I   m starting to lose brain cells a little bit. (Laughter)  Finchum I doubt that.  Robbins I think so. (Laughs) Steph might could, she   s pretty good at that.  Finchum We   ll ask her, I   ll ask her.  Robbins Okay, I   ll let you do it. Maybe she   ll get it. I   ll be mad at her if she gets it and I don   t. (Laughs)  Finchum When was the last time you were on campus?  Robbins Like for an OSU event or for anything?  Finchum Just for anything.  Robbins Well, I   m going this weekend to stay with my mom, and I   m taking my daughter and her four kids. We always go to Theta Pond. They want to go see the ducks. I   ll probably be there this weekend, but I also probably was there   . A lot of times I go down to the student store to shop when I   m there, and I was there in June, and went to the student store in June. 20  Finchum Around Theta, did you see the new carving?  Robbins No, I haven   t.  Finchum There   s a new carving, you   ll have to   the kids will love it. It   s a stump and a little boy fishing.  Robbins Oh, really?  Finchum One of the trees.  Robbins Like all around on the edges, where they have   .  Finchum One of the trees died or whatever, and they carved, at least that   s   .  Robbins Who did it?  Finchum I   m not sure. I watched a little bit of it because you use a chainsaw to do it.  Robbins Oh really? Now, I know you know this because I know he gave you my name, but we   re so excited about campus and how it looks. I always have to drive my mom through because she   s a master gardener. Steve Dobbs is from Sallisaw, who is now the head of, I don   t know what you call it, landscaping or groundskeeper at OSU. It   s so beautiful, everything is so   the pots he   s done.  Finchum It   s great, and the topiaries, the boot and the hat, and the OSU  Robbins We   re so excited that it   s him, and he   s such a neat guy, and of course grew up here.  Finchum I   m going to interview him later about campus, but since he didn   t live here, I couldn   t do him for this project.  Robbins No, but he had for a while. They   ve got quite a bit of land between here and Vian. For a while, he had a greenhouse out there, and you   d go and get your summer plants there and all that.  Finchum It looks great.  Robbins It is beautiful.  Finchum In the last ten years, it   s just   .  21  Robbins That   s about how long he   s been there, maybe not quite ten, but yes, he   s amazing. We always drive through there and look, and try to see what he   s done different. Then I always try to email him or something, and tell him how pretty it looks. He   s a neat guy.  Finchum It looks great, and your mother likes to go too?  Robbins Oh yes, she   s a master gardener, so she loves   . She is on oxygen, she has pretty bad congestive heart failure, is on oxygen all the time, can   t really get out and walk, but I   ll drive her all around. We try to drive in nooks and crannies, and let her see. She always will say, if we   re going somewhere, even to the bank,    Will you drive me through campus?     Finchum From Monroe, you should be able to see the carving. It looks like a person at first, because it looks pretty real from the road. She   ll like that.  Robbins I   ll drive her down there and see. I don   t know if she knows about it yet. She was telling me that tonight, they   re having some big thing downtown with food trucks and music.  Finchum I have not done that, but they do have   .  Robbins Is it to raise money for something?  Finchum They just have gotten into food trucks. I don   t know if it   s every Friday or once a month Friday, they bring them in. I don   t know, I haven   t been. (Laughs)  Robbins I don   t think we   ll go either with four kids. She said it   s always really busy, and just keeping up with all of them is hard. They   re ten, seven, five, and six months. (Laughs)  Finchum Hands full.  Robbins Yes, we do.  Finchum From Shawnee, to Stillwater, to Sallisaw, all Ss. Where do you consider home now?  Robbins I consider Sallisaw home. Although, we talk about that too. When you think about when you die where you   re going to be buried. I   m sure we   ll be buried here. You start being where your family is, even though I still consider Shawnee, I really don   t consider Stillwater. I   ve never lived, except college, in Stillwater. I actually lived in Tulsa too, and then Kirksville, Missouri, when I got married, but I consider Sallisaw home.  22  Finchum You   ve been here   .  Robbins Not quite forty-one years, because I married Rick, and then we went back to Kirksville, and he finished medical school two years. Then he did his internship at OSU Medical Center, and then we came here. We   ve been here about thirty-eight or something like that, but I consider   yeah, more than half my life, so Sallisaw is home for me.  Finchum You could have gone anywhere, but you chose to stay in Oklahoma?  Robbins My husband   s brother, Barry, was in practice here in Sallisaw. He asked Rick to come back and go into practice with him. We moved here for Rick to go into practice with Barry. We got here in June, and Barry decided in August he was going to go back and do a neurology residency. He left and has not come back here. We   ve had the practice by ourselves since then, but that   s what brought us here. Stilwell was home for him, so it   s only about thirty minutes for him. Then at that time, my parents were living in Shawnee, and we   re just about two hours, right on I-40. It was a good place for us, and I love eastern Oklahoma, it   s so beautiful here. You have the green trees and hills.  Finchum And hills, yes.  Robbins It   s so pretty, yes.  Finchum And you can get to Stillwater     Robbins It   s different from where I grew up.  Finchum    in about two and a half hours.  Robbins Yeah, it   s not too bad. The only bad part   s going through Tulsa and the traffic, but it   s not too bad, if you can hit it not at rush hour.  Finchum No, and I guess you could go I-40 through 177     Robbins You could.  Finchum    take a little longer, maybe.  Robbins Yes, it does.  Finchum You   ve tried it all?  Robbins Anyways, but I   ve done that. Yes, I   ve done that a lot, especially as you get older. You start worrying about   I worry more about   one time, Rick and I 23  were on our way to an OSU football game, and I was driving, and a deer ran in front of me. I should   ve just hit it, but you try to avoid it, and I lost control of the car, and we hit those concrete barriers and flipped over it. It was a really   I mean, we both walked away and lived, but it makes you a little more aware of   . I don   t really like to drive now at dusk or early because I think the deer are out. You just get more cautious, I think, as you get older.  Finchum We do. (Laughter)  Robbins This is the first year in probably twenty, twenty-five years, we did not renew our tickets this year. It   s just getting   it   s hard as you get older to get home at one, or two, or three o   clock in the morning.  Finchum Basketball and football?  Robbins We never had basketball. We could get...we just couldn   t take off work enough to go twice a week, but we   ve had football for probably twenty-five years. This will be the first year, I   ll be sad, but you have to start thinking about your health.  Finchum You can watch it on TV.  Robbins That   s right. Now, almost every game   s on TV.  Finchum You   ve been big supporters and still are.  Robbins Yes, and we still will probably go some, and if they go to a bowl or do anything like that, we   ll probably try to go. It   s just too hard, the drive, just getting to where we can   t do it anymore.  Finchum Special times though.  Robbins Yes, it is. Lots of good memories.  Finchum I think that   s probably a good place to stop.  Robbins Okay, great.  -------  -------
