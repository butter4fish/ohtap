 Paustenbaugh  It is Friday morning, October 17th. This is Jennifer Paustenbaugh and I  am here with Ed Dobson. We are doing an interview for the O-STATE  Stories Oral History Project at Oklahoma State University. Ed is a  former Pistol Pete and he is back here for a reunion this weekend for all  of the Pistol Petes. Thank you so much for you willingness to participate  in this interview, and welcome back to campus. When was the last time  you were here?  Two years ago, for the same football game, Homecoming.  Oh, okay.  We lost to Texas A M when we had a kick blocked.  Oh, that   s right. That was a terrible game   An extra point blocked.  Well we   re hoping the outcome is going to be a lot better tomorrow.   Knocks on wood   That   s right. (Laughs)  With what happened to BYU yesterday, we   d better be ready for upsets.  Yes, and Baylor has a pretty good quarterback.  Robert Griffin   Yeah, they showed it against Iowa State last week.  Yeah, he   s pretty exciting. So at least we have that little confidence  builder of having gone against a really good quarterback and come out  5  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  on top last weekend.  Oh yeah, on national TV in their house.  October 11, 2008 OSU vs.  Missouri   (Laughs) That   s right. That was really great. Well, can you remember  the first time you saw the Pistol Pete mascot?  Well, it would have been the first football game probably of the 1961  football season. It was my freshmen year. I can   t remember who we  played first that year. But all of a sudden I was involved with the  Homecoming events later on and I got to see how the fellows were  handling this mascot role and got interested in it. During the course of  the year, our residential assistant at East Bennett Hall on the fourth floor,  Randall Acton, started talking to me about how they were going to have  interviews for Pistol Pete later on in the spring and that if I was really  interested I ought to try out because the fellow that was doing it that year  was not going to be doing it again. In those days they never had anybody  do it twice. That was early; Pistol Pete as a mascot was only a few years  old in 1961. I guess    58 was the first year we had anybody actually  represent themselves as Frank Eaton and the head came along right after  that.  So at that point, was there just one Pistol Pete and they didn   t select two  Petes?  Right. I don   t know when they actually began selecting two fellows to  do it, but for quite awhile it would just take one.  Where two fellows  show up in the early years, replacements were involved.   So it must have been a big job then to take that on?  Actually, not near as much as today because not very many events  invited the Pistol Pete mascot. I mean I was the first one to take Pete to  wrestling matches.  Okay.  I think the guy before me actually did basketball games but I can   t swear  to that. I might have been the first to do basketball, too. And I was  definitely the first to do baseball. There was a little ridicule going on.  You know,    What do you think you   re doing showing up in that big  head at some of these events?    I was way ahead of my time for that.  Not just here, but maybe in intercollegiate athletics altogether?  6  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Nobody went from collegiate mascot into the professional ranks in those  days.  (Laughs) Okay, so what was your first impression of the Pistol Pete  mascot when you saw him?     Wow, that   s cool     (Laughter)  So I guess moving back before your time as Pistol Pete, can you tell us a  little bit about yourself before you came to OSU? And what it was that  brought you here to this school?  Well, to make a long story short, between my junior and senior year in  high school, I went down to Bo Belcher   s Chandler Baseball Camp in  Chandler, Oklahoma and played there for a couple of weeks that  summer. I just fell in love with Oklahoma at that point. I thought,    I   ve  got to get back out here.    So the best way to do that would be to go to  college. So I started looking into OU and OSU. The head of the  Radio/TV Department at that time was a fellow by the name of Bob  Lacey. He used a little reverse psychology on me. He interviewed me for  whether or not I should come down to enroll in the Radio/TV  Department because that   s what I was looking into. When we got done  he said,    Ah, you ought to go to OU. You   re from New York. You  wouldn   t like it out here in the western country. You need to be among  them city slickers. Why don   t you just go down to Norman?    I said,    Oh  yeah? I   ll show you     (Laughter) So I showed up out here.  The first thing I did on KVRO my fall semester, freshman year, they put  me on as a newscaster with disc jockey Ed Turner, who was a senior  about to graduate with a commission in the Air Force from his ROTC,  and he was getting his degree in Radio/TV and his program was    The  Southern Indoctrination Show.    Here he had this Yankee newscaster. So  one of the things he set out to do was to convert the Yankee into an  Okie, at least voice wise. I played along with it and we had a good time  and by the end of that semester I sounded like I do now.  So you got rid of that Yankee accent, huh? (Laughs)  Sure did.  in heavy New York accent   (Laughs) So what part of New York are you from?  Long Island  in heavy New York accent .  Well, he really did a convincing job.  7  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Yeah, that   s what they said, too.  in heavy New York accent   That   s pretty funny. So it was the experience in a baseball camp and the  interview that really got you to come to Stillwater?  Yeah.  That was quite a distance away to go to school.  Yeah, I had this idea that Oklahoma was the place I wanted to go. So  going to college out here was the best way to get here.  Can you tell us a little bit about your OSU experience apart from your  Pistol Pete activities? What other things you were involved with?  No, can   t talk about any of that. (Laughter) Oh, let   s see what else. One  of the things that happened   I don   t know how it will be on sequential  stuff here, but around the time I got here, they were going to build some  new dormitories. They started out   they were called Dorm A and Dorm  B.  How creative   I moved into Dorm B from East Bennett Hall. Then we started trying to  figure out how we   re going to name these dorms and we had a little  council there in the dorm and some of the fellows thought we ought to  reach back into the Native American connection in our history. So who  could we name this dorm after? We settled on Quanah Parker. There was  a lot of argument about whether or not we should go that way. Not just  Parker himself, but with choosing the Native American person   s name.  After it was all said and done that   s the way we went.  Well, I didn   t know that that was the Parker in Parker Hall.  I don   t think much is said about it these days   where that comes from.  But that   s true probably with most of the dorm names. If you ask some  of the students living in the dorms now,    Where   d that name come  from?    They   d probably say,    I   ll look it up and get back to you.     Right, if they would even do that  So you mentioned that you had seen  Pistol Pete first at football games and you thought that he was pretty  cool and that     Probably saw him first at the pep rally before the first game and took it  from there.  8  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Tell me about the try-out process was like at that point. How many  people tried out and what did you have to do?  As I remember, Randall Acton might have been the president of the  Residence Halls Council at that time. I may have mentioned him earlier.   Randall was senior class president in 1962-63, graduated in January  1964.   Right, you said he was your resident assistant.  He was our R.A. and the try-out was really an interview process with the  committee from the Student Senate. I don   t think that they actually  asked us to wear the head and go out and try to carry it around and  perform anything. The Pete position was not really considered part of  the cheer squad, pep squad or any of that. King Casey was the Director  of Student Activities. He was determined that the person under that hat  would be totally anonymous. Nobody would know who it was. It would  not be in the O   Colly. It would not be anywhere, who got chosen to be  Pistol Pete   very secret process. And Pete would just be out there as the  mascot and that   d be it. Nobody would know who was under there. I   ll  get to some little variation on that later, but   so when I went into this  process that was the presumption. They made a big point of it.    Now  how are you going to be able to handle this? You going to be able to  handle being totally anonymous? Now don   t tell anyone on campus that  you   re Pistol Pete. Think you can do that?    So I said,    Yeah, I think I  can.    I don   t know if anybody else actually got that far in the interview  because I eventually got the job, and I didn   t think I was going to get it.  So were you able to be anonymous? I mean that sounds like a pretty  difficult challenge, even if you   re very determined that you   re going to  be.  Actually, it was easy on campus because I would always come out of a  closed room and go back into a closed room. I remember there was a  back door or whatever, how I got out of there without anybody putting it  together that,    Oh yeah, you must be Pete.    But I   m sure a lot of people  knew who Pete was, but the idea was not to make a big thing out of it.  Almost anybody that found out was sort of told,    Don   t spread it  around.    And that went on very well here on campus. But then later in  the football season in 1962, we played Army and Pete got to go. Being  from Long Island, Pete got to stop off at my house. So the neighborhood  figured out, obviously, if somebody is carrying around that head it must  be the guy. But that didn   t get in any publicity back here.  At the game, everything was fine until the end of the game. It was a  great game. Army had a, as I remember, winning streak going at Michie  9  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Stadium. They hadn   t lost for awhile. We came in there as a big  underdog and beat them, twelve to seven. After the game, my folks were  up in the stands; we got crosswise on some communications about how  we were going to reconnect later. So about a half hour after the game  was over, I wound up taking the hat off so that I could communicate  with them and most everybody was gone, the stands were pretty empty,  but there were a bunch of kids hanging around who were just fascinated  with the mascot Pistol Pete. Then as soon as the hat came off, I got  engaged in conversation, had to tell them all about it. There was a  newspaper there and so here came all the pictures of Pistol Pete in the  local paper the next day.  Now, that didn   t have any effect back here in Stillwater, but King Casey,  Director of Student Activities, was just horrified that that had happened.  So he called me in on the carpet when we got back and said if I ever let  that happen again he was going to see to it that I got removed from the  position and all that. We didn   t have any problems with it after that. It  was just that isolated event. But then I didn   t try out for the position my  junior year because I wanted to pursue sports casting.  You did this as a sophomore?  I did it as a sophomore and     Which today would be really unusual?  It would. It was also unusual that somebody from Long Island   but I  had gone through the    Southern Indoctrination Show    with Ed Turner,  so that kind of cut the ice    And Frank Eaton, the real Pistol Pete, was  from Conneticut.   Did you learn how to swagger, too, as part of that whole process or was  Pete not so much of a swaggerer at that point?  Oh, sure. We did a lot of swaggering. In fact, under that hat, I don   t  remember what it weighed total, it was probably about 45 pounds   it  was hard not to swagger.  (Laughter) Yeah.  Just moving around, you   re going to do a little of that.  You served as Pete during the 1962-63 school year?  Yeah, and then in    63-   64, I was following the team around, calling play  by play for KVRO and went down to Texas in Austin and called the  10  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  game on a telephone line from there. We weren   t really trying to  compete with KSPI and Bill Platt, but we were trying to get our own  students experience with the play by play. In those days KVRO was a  ten-watt local station, but we had established an antenna by running  wires through the steam tunnels all over campus. So putting a ten-watt  signal through all of that wire spread all over the campus gave us an  incredible reach. People were picking us up in Perry and all on the  radios going down toward Oklahoma City and all of a sudden we got in  trouble with the Federal Communicates Commission because a ten-watt  local student station wasn   t supposed to have that kind of reach. But we  dealt with that and had a pretty good year. I was the first person, as far  as I know, to actually broadcast play-by-play wrestling on the radio. I  don   t think KSPI had done it yet in 1962      63-   64.  Okay.  But I took the microphone to Old Gallagher Hall and set it up there in  front of the mat and broadcast the wrestling matches on KVRO.  So was wrestling a sport you were pretty familiar with before you came  here?  I hadn   t wrestled, but my high school, Wellington C. Mepham High  School, I wrote it down the on the form   actually I just put W.C.  Mepham. But that school had a coach by the name of Sprig Gardner who  is in the Wrestling Hall of Fame over here. He built quite a program in  that high school. The school opened around 1938. My father and mother  were in the first graduating class at Wellington C. Mepham High School.  My dad didn   t wrestle. He was in the band, but he had a lot of friends  that did, and that program over the years really made a name for itself.  So I had friends that wrestled, and I went to all the wrestling matches at  Mepham. So I was quite interested in the sport. I hadn   t known much  about Oklahoma State, but then I got here and found that this is a  national power. I was just excited about who can I get from Mepham to  come here. That never did play out, but we had a lot of fun thinking  about it.  So had you heard play-by-play of wrestling matches before you had set  out to do it yourself?  Nope.  I had never heard it until I came here, and not having seen a wrestling  match before but having heard it on the radio, I knew all of this  terminology but I had no idea what any of it actually looked like   11  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  It   s kind of like listening to hockey on the radio. You don   t really know  what   s going on until you go to a game.  Yeah that is certainly true. So when you were Pete, did you receive any  compensation for being Pete?  Oh, no.  But my senior year the C.H. Hyer Boot Company donated a  pair of boots. Hyer had made boots for Frank Eaton.   No? Okay.  My first year and then after my junior year I heard   I can   t remember  who told me, whether it came from Randall Acton who was a graduate  by then and got back to me,    You know, you ought to think about trying  out again because they   re having trouble.    They had a guy who was  going to be Pete in    63-   64 and for whatever reason, that didn   t work  out. And then they got Gene Doris to fill in the rest of it. His father, I  think his name was Troy Doris, was a professor in the biology  department here. But then Gene didn   t want to do it or he was leaving  the next year. For whatever reason it wasn   t working out and they were  not happy with the prospects that had applied for it in the spring of    64,  so I got this phone call and said,    If you can see your way clear to try  that again, why don   t you go do it?    I figured,    Well I   ve gotten my year  of sports casting in, let me go try that and see. If they really need another  Pete, I   ll do it.    So I wound up with it again. I was the first person to  have done it twice.  Well, and to have a space in between; that year where you didn   t do it,  that   s kind of interesting too. So you mentioned one of the don   ts of  being a Pistol Pete was,    Don   t reveal your identity under any  circumstances.    Were there any other dos and don   ts?  That was the big one. The other one was    don   t shoot anybody.     Okay.     Even though you got blanks, you can   t point that gun at anybody.     (Laughter)    I don   t care who it is, from Norman or from Lawrence,  Manhattan or wherever they   re from, you can   t point that gun at them.     But we did have some fun. There was a game here, OU came to town  and they had an Indian mascot. I don   t know if they still run an Indian  around on the field or not. I don   t think they do.  No, they   ve got that Sooner Schooner.  Well, they had something like that. I don   t think they took it on the road,  12  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  but they had something like that in Norman. But they had, I think the  fellow   I don   t know if I   m remembering things mixed up or what but I  would say that there was a fellow named Kirk Kickingbird who was the  Sooner mascot in the Indian costume. And when they were here we set  something up at half time where he got a call to go to the Field House to  take a phone call and then we ran out our own person dressed up like  him. He went around like he was going to do some damage on Pete and I  shot him (Laughter) and he laid on the field there for quite awhile and  you could hear a pin drop on the OU section of that stadium, Lewis  Field.  They thought you had really taken care of that, huh? (Laughter) So as  far as I   ve ever heard Pete has never talked. Was that part of the whole  concealing the identity?  Sure.  Okay. I didn   t know if there was anything else behind that?  I couldn   t say for right now, but back then, yeah, Pete wasn   t to talk to  anybody.  As far as behavior expectations were there different   I realize that there  were certain behavior expectations while you were portraying the  mascot, but as far as other behavior expectations when you weren   t  appearing somewhere as the mascot, were those different for the people  that were Pete?  Well, I don   t know if it was part of the idea of being anonymous but  they really didn   t care about the things we did as long as we stayed  sober.  Sort of kept your nose clean?  Yeah. Don   t get totally out of line even though nobody knows who you  are. And of course, you needed to keep your academics up. The second  time I did it, though, the rules got a little looser. I think there was a point  where it changed where King Casey   s rule of anonymity went by the  boards. We had a game where one of the alumni decided that Pete  needed a new pair of boots and he was donating them to me, not to the  school. These were boots I would take with me when I graduated. He  wanted them presented at halftime and he wanted me to put them on at  halftime. I had to take the hat off to do it.  Oh, gosh.  13  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  So that all happened at halftime. The head came off. I was on the ground  pulling the boots on. There were pictures in the Daily Oklahoman and  the Stillwater News Press.    Ed Dobson gets boots from C.H. Hyer Boot  Company.    That was sort of the end of the anonymity.  So do you still have those boots?  Wore them totally out.  They are not in the storage locker in Montana? (Laughs)  No, unfortunately, if I had known when I was disposing of those boots  that they might be of interest to anybody, I   d still have them. But in  those days, probably by 1980, I   d totally worn those things into a nub.  Anybody who knew me said,    Why don   t you toss them?    (Laughter) I  could not tell a lot of the people the history of it and make any sense out  of it. So, they eventually got tossed.  So was there anything special about the way they looked?  They were orange.  Orange, okay.  Oh yeah. (Laughs)  Well, I   d assume so, but I just wanted a clarification on that.  You bet. I am sorry I did not bring that right up.  That   s fine. So you mentioned that the original Pete   the first two or  three years of the Pistol Pete mascot, he appeared at football games  only, and then, possibly, basketball, but that wrestling and baseball were  new sports that you introduced Pete at.  As far as I know. Now Bill Smith may want to say something about that.  He is being interviewed     Tomorrow.  Good. Be sure to ask him where he went. What he did as far as the  events, the games that he went to and if he went on the road, because I  had the impression that me taking Pete to Army might have been the  first serious out-of-state road trip.  Okay. So did you appear at anything other than athletics?  14  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Pep rallies.  Pep rallies.  Yeah, and in the Walk Around. They were things that we were trying  out. Where would Pete show up? Once I started saying,    Pete is going to  more athletic events.    Then they started thinking,    Where else?    At the  same time, they were thinking about where Pete could go in   62-   63     they were still constrained to the idea that we cannot blow the cover. So  a lot of things Pete might have gone to didn   t happen because it was too  risky.  Then, after the dam broke in the football season of    64, it was a lot  easier. Everybody knew then. Then, everywhere I went around campus,  I   d get picked on. And there were a lot of ways to take the name    Pistol  Pete    and turn it into an epithet. I got to hear all of them. Not from other  schools but just people around campus who wanted to pick on the guy  that wore the hat. That was strange.  Yeah, I would say almost unexpected.  It was.  At least in my mind.  It was at the time.  Yeah. The next question I have for you is sort of answered with what you  just said. Was your Pistol Pete experience anything you that you thought  it would be? I guess so, maybe more your first   going into the first year  that you did it because, obviously, the second time you did it, you had a  set of expectations of what it was going to like.  It was, yeah. I can   t remember right now whether I was sitting there at  the first interview thinking,    Wow  Pete   s going to Army. I want to be  that guy     (Laughter)    I   m gonna get to go home that weekend.    It  probably was going through my mind, but I just can   t remember right  now. So the expectations were that,    This is gonna be great traveling  with the team, traveling with the pep squad    or whoever it was. I  remember going down the road to Kansas in the backseat of a  Volkswagen with a couple of cheerleaders in the front and another  cheerleader sitting in the back with me. I can   t remember all of the  cheerleaders    names but it seems like one of their names was Charlie  and he was driving. I don   t think we ever made it past a rest stop. One of  us had to rest every time   we never had to go all out at once, but one of  us would have to go in every town when we got to a town.  15  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  So was this a Volkswagen     Bug. Charlie   s.  Bug? So what did you do with the hat?  Oh, that hat got to go on the bus with the team.  (Laughter) Oh, okay. Perfect. So what was a typical week like for you as  a Pete?  Typical week?  I mean was it pretty much like any student week, and then on Saturday  you had a totally different experience than everyone else did, pretty  much?  Yeah. Nobody else had 40 pounds of cover. (Laughter) But one of the  things that happened   I can   t remember if I started doing this at the end  of the first football season in    62 or if I didn   t start this until    64, but I  would run out ahead of the team and I would run straight at the team  bench. You can see straight ahead pretty good, through the head, but  then you lose vision as you get closer to something if it   s low. So I  would have to guess at my footsteps and I would run straight at the team  bench  knocks on table  and jump up on it and jump over. And I did that  every home game.  You never missed?  Never missed. I don   t have to worry about jinxing myself now because I  ain   t doing it again  (Laughter) But one advantage was that the hat did  not sit flush up against my chest, so I had this little window of vision  where I could see straight down, so when I got to the bench,  knocks on  table  I knew what I was stepping on right at the last second and I could  get up over it. But a lot of people in the stands were watching for that  just expecting that Pete was going to run head over heels and     Wipe out?  Wipe out.  (Laughter) So how did you build yourself up to be in more run with the  45 pound hat on your shoulders?  Well     16  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Anything special?  No, it was just a matter of being halfway coordinated, I guess.  Well not everybody has that going for them  What was it like to step out  on the field for the first time as Pete?  That was a long time ago. I   m not sure I remember other than   I was  probably numb to the experience because it was just all happening and I  was in there and everybody else was out there. It   s kind of a muffled  situation, so you don   t get to hear a lot of things that are going on. If  people want to talk to you they   ve got to come up and holler into the eye  socket, because there   s all of this background noise in the stands, and  between the muffling of the hat and the background noise it was really  hard to hear what anybody was saying.  Now Pistol Pete   s movements are really sort of, I guess, choreographed  by the person that is in charge of the game day experience. I   m  assuming at that time that there wasn   t this organization about the game  day experience like there is now.  Exactly. There was none of that.  So you really were barely autonomous as far as what you chose to do?  Oh, sure, if a couple of guys got together and said,    Hey, we   re gonna  pull a fast one on the mascot from Norman   ,    we didn   t have to clear it  with anybody. (Laughter) We just pulled it off.  You talked about the stunt where you sent a double out for the mascot.  Were there any other memorable stunts that you did as Pete?  No, not really as far as skits in that sense. No, that   s the only one that  really sticks in my mind.  Is there anything in particular that you remember about Frank Eaton,  upon whom this caricature was based?  I think he was dead when I got here in    61.  I think you   re right.  But not by much.  No, I think he died in    59 or    58.  17  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  That is sort of coincidental with the establishment of the mascot that we  know today because until Frank passed, he was here.  Right.  And so there was no need to portray him and then the first guy that got  the idea of doing it, didn   t wear a mask or anything, he just dressed up.  Then the next year they said,    Well, let   s do something with this.     So were there any of his personal characteristics that you tried to  portray when you were Pete?  Tried to learn how to spin pistols (Laughter). And I got halfway decent  on it.  I wondered if that was something that was harder than it looks.  Well it   s a little bit harder under that head when you   re starting out. I  hadn   t done anything like that before. So trying to learn it I had to spend  a lot of time just spinning pistols without the head on to make sure I  knew what I was doing and getting them into the holster properly and  not looking like an idiot.  When you can   t see.  Yeah. So when I took the position when I got back on campus in the Fall  of    62, the pistols were issued to me. It   s not like I had to go to a locker  and check them out every Saturday. I kept them in my room so I could  get handy with them.  So how much did you practice?  Well as they used to say,    Ed was eaten up with it. He spun those guns  in his room a lot.    (Laughter) And my roommate at the time knew who  Pistol Pete was and he wasn   t supposed to tell anybody   he told a lot of  people.  (Laughter) It was too good of a secret to try to keep, huh?  Yeah, there was too much fun to be had with that information.  So, in your mind, how does the Pistol Pete mascot differ from other  school   s mascots?  Firearms is the big thing.  Okay.  18  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Even now, there   s more pressure built in to remove the firearms and the  guys who play Pete are going to have to be real careful that they don   t  upset the apple cart. Nobody better go jumping up and down on  somebody else   s dugout anymore because that would be an excuse for  taking a gun away.  Yeah. Well, and even now sometimes at games you hear that gun go off  and it   s really alarming.  Yeah.  I think the way we respond to that is a lot different than when the whole  Pistol Pete mascot started out.  Oh yeah. And there was no shot gun when I had it. It was just a couple  of pistols   38s.  Okay.  And sure, you could hear them go off but it wasn   t a big noise. Shot  gun? That   s loud.  That   s a big noise. Yeah, it really is. So did you ever participate in any  kind of a mascot competition as Pete?  No.  No? Okay, that must have come later on.  They couldn   t do that with Pete and retain the anonymity.  So do you have any strong opinion about whether Pete captures the  spirit of this university better than other mascots capture the spirit of  their university?  Well, that   s a tough one. I mean if you asked anybody from another  school that has a lot of school spirit, they would all stick up for their  own mascots. At least most of them as far as I can tell. But Pete really  can represent an individual spirit and it   s important to remember that  other schools wanted that caricature.  Right.  When we went up to the University of Wyoming and they had the  NCAA wrestling tournament up there they had Pistol Pete   s face all over  everything with the UW under it   University of Wyoming. When they  19  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  saw me show up with that head, a lot of students up at Wyoming  accused us of stealing their mascot. Then there was this big education  program that went on about Frank Eaton and where the idea came from  and they didn   t know any of that. I think New Mexico State University  down in Las Cruces had the same problem.  Right. Yeah, I remember when I came here that there was a big dispute  over the Pistol Pete trademark and even though we had been using it  longer, the University of Wyoming had registered their use before ours,  so they have all of these rules about how the mascots have to be  identified and even special rules in competition with each other. It   s kind  of interesting how the law got involved in a mascot issue.  Oh yeah, it   s a little bit like the precursor to the big argument today over  whether or not there should be any Indian caricatures at all.  Right. And was there any moment that stands out as a really  embarrassing moment of being Pistol Pete that you want to share on a  recording?  For me, personally? Or for the mascot?  Well, for you personally, but if there are other incidents that you can  think of     Well, I felt horribly embarrassed at West Point when I had to take the  hat off because I knew the repercussions were coming. But other than  that, no.  So because you were able to step on that bench every time we don   t have  to hear a story about how you missed once     Right.  And had a big wipe out   Nope, there   s no broken bones related to that effort.  Did you feel any special sense of responsibility of representing the  university as Pistol Pete?  Oh yeah. My regular hats were all too small, my head got so big.  (Laughter) I was swelling up to try to fill Pete   s hat.  Well, obviously at the time it meant a great deal to you to have  portrayed Pistol Pete, I mean in the retrospect, I guess, of 46 years. How  20  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  do you rate that experience now? Is it still something important to you  as part of who you were or are?  Well, finding out that it was significant enough to get back here to get  interviewed. That sure put a new spin on it.  Well it   s been pretty interesting to us to talk to people and to see the  whole evolution of Pistol Pete. I think one of the things that may surprise  you, I did service in the university archives for the OSU library, and  about two months before Homecoming the Pistol Pete questions would  start coming fast and furious, so everyone that works in that department  became a de facto Pistol Pete expert and knows all of the history with  Frank Eaton. But some of these stories the mascots themselves are  sharing or the people that were the mascot are really interesting to us.  We   re trying to create a Pistol Pete website in part so we don   t have to  answer the same questions day after day after day.  Well, over the last few years   I was here in    04 and was in the  Homecoming parade on the float and all that. It was the first time I had  come back and done that. At the same time I was looking at the list, I  didn   t realize it, somebody had put the list together. I think Lance Millis  was the first one to go back and build the list of Pistol Petes and he had a  lot of blanks in there. He didn   t have me at all. He had other people in  my years and a blank in one of the   somewhere where I was   and then  there was Mitch Dobson who was Pistol Pete a couple of years after me.  Any relation?  No. But Mitch knew I had done it and he got the idea    Well, if one  Dobson can do it       so he went ahead a couple of years later and got it.  But I went in and started to do some research to try to straighten out the  list. So if you compare Lance Millis    list, which is now gone, I don   t  think it   s up on any website anymore. It was under okstate.com.  There used to be a list of Petes under a category of traditions. I   m not  sure that category is even there now. It   s all under pep squad and all that.  So they may have gotten down to one list, but if you could compare that  list from say 1958 to 1970, Lance   s old list with the list we have now,  the differences are the things that I found out. I went ahead and  researched all of that and got those names straightened out.  My updates  disappeared in October 2008.   Lance   s list is back up, replacing the  Spirit list, but not merging the 1960s updates.   Well, thank you for doing that because I think that   s an important part of  properly documenting this tradition. I know Lance did a lot of work  when he spearheaded the nomination effort for Frank Eaton to be in the  21  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  National Cowboy Hall of Fame back in the early    90s.  Great.  So I think that   s when his interest in this became really pretty strong.  Yeah, he can   t get enough credit for what he   s done. It was a great job  getting that thing going.  Well, and your help, obviously, is much appreciated in getting the early  years right. Is there a special bond between the former Petes?  Sure, amongst a lot of them. I can   t say that every former Pete is bonded  to every other former Pete. I mean there are some of them that we  haven   t seen that didn   t make it back, like I started coming back. We  don   t know among quite a few of the early ones who is still alive and  who isn   t.  Dave Davis showed up for the first time at this Homecoming,  October 2008.   Right.  But with things like this happening, whatever bonds there are, are going  to get stronger for sure.  Is there a collective legacy of the Pistol Petes?  Of material?  Well, I mean as a group, is there any legacy that you offer as former  Pistol Petes?  Well, you know, I   m thinking that the legacy is going to be what we  make of it. And if you had asked that question in 1980 it probably would  just have drawn some blank stares.  Right.  What kind of legacy could have possibly, from those guys who were just  mascot representing   working under the hat. But all of a sudden we had  things come along where people could be considered for All-American  mascots and we had some All-Americans. So there is some national  recognition that   s happening along with the local recognition and that   s  building a great tradition and really legacy is all about   tradition is all  about legacy. They   re interchangeable at that stage for what we   re  doing.  22  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Right.  I was just thinking that where we finally laid anonymity to rest, now and  forever, was probably in the    65 Redskin. I don   t think anybody was  identified as having served as Pistol Pete in the Redskin until    65 and  there   s a picture of me with a stupid sign that we had.  What was the stupid sign?  Well, you really have to get the context. We had this great basketball  team with Gene Johnson and Larry Hawk and James King. We lost Bob  Swaffar because he had stuck his arm down in the washing machine  when it was in the spin cycle and got his arm caught on some clothing  and it just spun his arm off. Lester Berryhill was, I think, studying pre-med  and he knew what to do. They packed his arm all up in ice and  rushed him off and got his arm sewed back on, but that was the end of  his basketball for Oklahoma State, and Bob has been asked a lot of  times,    Well don   t you think you would have won the nationals if you   d  have still been playing for them when they won the Big Eight, went up  to Wichita and should have gone on to the national title game?    Bob just  says,    Oh they would have went on if they would have played better.     (Laughter) But yeah, losing Bob was a huge impact on that team and I  think they would have gone all the way if Bob would have still been  around. But, where was I going with that?  With the sign.  The sign, yes. That was the year I had this sign and there was a sense  early on that this team could be great. So they needed some kind of a  slogan, the fans wanted a slogan and different things were happening  and I said one time,    Hey we don   t mess around.    Somebody said,    Why  don   t you make a sign out of that?    and I said,    Well that   s too clunky a  sign. I mean, am I gonna carry something around with all of those  words? That   s nuts     And they said,    Well, if you think about it you  could make it counter point. You could have a messed up sign where all  of the messing up is left on the sign.    So this sign is in the yearbook and  it says,    Hey we don   t mess around.    The    d    is kind of squished right  in there right at the end like the sign was made without enough space.  (Laughter) Okay.  So that was the counter point.    We   re leaving all of our messin    around  on the sign.    But a lot of people never got it. Some of the players on the  team didn   t get it and they were hollerin       What the hell is that sign  doin    out here?    (Laughter) But the sign made it all the way to the Big  Eight Championship.  23  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Well great, now we have that context for that photo in the yearbook, too.  Yeah and seeing the guy   me   the one that was Pistol Pete. Oh well,  King Casey finally laid it to rest,    We   re not going to worry about  anonymity anymore.     So are there people, I mean maybe this isn   t something that comes up in  casual conversation with your friends. When people learn that you were  Pistol Pete or the university mascot, are they surprised?  Oh sure. Especially if they see Pete out on the field and I say,    I used to  do that.       What?    (Laughter)  That   s interesting. Are there any life lessons that you learned from being  Pete? Not that I want you to necessarily feel like you have to act  philosophical but     Well, a lot of people like to quote Satchel Paige as saying,    Don   t look  back    cause somethin    might be gainin    on ya.    I didn   t look back at  Pistol Pete for a long time. Then, all of a sudden I found out that all  these guys who were doing Pete after me were organized enough where  somebody was looking for me. (Laughter) So, it ain   t all bad what   s  gaining on you.  Sure. I guess, maybe   did that make you feel it was a more important  experience than you had thought it was at the time?  Sure, oh yeah. Not that I thought that Pete, the mascot, was more or less  any important, but my doing it seemed like a lot more   it was a lot more  important after I found out that Pistol Pete   s were supposed to come  back to the Homecoming parade and ride back on the float together. I  didn   t know that for a long time.  And then there at the collective parade marshals tomorrow, where you   ll  be on the float again.  Not just on the float, but in the front  (Laughs)  That   s right. It will be big time. Well, that   s exciting. Reflecting back,  would you do it again?  You bet. Absolutely. Probably try for all three years instead of going  back on the sports beat  (Laughter)  So just as a follow up, your career when you left here, were you  involved in sports broadcasting and journalism or     24  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  Dobson  Paustenbaugh  I went from here to Ohio University to grad school and no, not at all, at  that level. And I didn   t finish my master   s degree. I went in the Peace  Corps from there.  Where did you serve?  India. That was before the Peace Corps got kicked out of India,  obviously.  Okay.  In    66 and    67. But I got real sick over there and didn   t finish my two  years. When I came home, I was all excited about the social service  aspects and decided to try my skills that I had picked up in the Peace  Corps in a situation here in this country where I might be able to make it  work. So I wound up as a Head Start teacher on the Seminole  Reservation at Big Cypress Florida in the late    60s. This was before  there was any Alligator Alley. So this was pretty remote back in the Big  Cypress swamp in those days and social service has been my life ever  since. I wound up going to law school and served nine years in the  Montana Water Court as a judge. They called us    water master,    but we  had all of the powers of the district court. And now I   m a lawyer for the  Navajo Legal Services on the Navajo Reservation.  Alright. And that explains your location in southeastern Utah.  It does.  Excellent, well is there any question that you wish that I had asked you  about your Pete experience or anything else that I didn   t ask you?  I   ll think of that as soon as I get fifteen minutes down the road  So like I  was saying before, I better reserve the right to revise and extend my  remarks. (Laughter)  Well, we will certainly allow you to do that. Thank you so much for  being here today and agreeing to participate in the interview.  Very proud to do it.  It was a pleasure.  -------  -------
