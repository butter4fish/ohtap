David Cline: So today is May 25, 2010, and this is David Cline for the Southern Oral History Program.  I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee with Bill Murrah, and Bill, if you could introduce yourself, tell me what year you were born and where, and we&#8217;ll start from there and sort of start with childhood history and move on.
Bill Murrah: Okay, Bill Murrah.  I live in Knoxville.  I was born in Chicago, believe it or not, because my parents were living in Chicago.  My dad is from a small town, a rural area between Birmingham and Montgomery, Chilton County.  It&#8217;s the peach county of Alabama, and so he grew up on a twenty-acre little farm.  My mother is from Plains, Georgia and her dad was a sharecropper, so that&#8217;s my family roots.
DC: How did they come to be in Chicago?  And what year were you born?
BM: 1945.  I was born thirteen days before Japan surrendered.  My dad served in the army as a meat inspector in the stockyards.  That was his foxhole.  So he came home every night to my mom and my older sister.
DC: Right.
BM: That was his--.
DC: That was his war.
BM: That was his war.
DC: Yeah.
BM: So I was born right at the end of the war, I mean, you know, right when it ended, and then when I was eight months old they came on back down to Alabama and I grew up in Alabama, and all my life I&#8217;ve been going to Georgia.  My roots are in these two rural areas.  On my mom&#8217;s side my sister was the first person to finish college and I was the second, in our family history, and then on my dad&#8217;s side he went to college and so did his two sisters and his brothers.  And so, then I grew up--.
DC: And you said it&#8217;s a very small town that you--?
BM: Where I grew up?
DC: Yeah.
BM: Well I grew up outside of a small town.
DC: Okay. [Laughs]
BM: [Laughs] So about two miles from Scottsboro, Alabama.  We lived on ten acres, where my dad still lives, and raised most of our own food and raised hogs.  My dad worked in town.  He had a regular paying public job, as people say, and so he had a regular, steady paycheck and we owned our own house, a little house.
DC: I haven&#8217;t heard--.  So public job is--?
BM: Have you not heard that expression?
DC: No, as opposed to working on the farm?
BM: On the farm.  That&#8217;s a public job.
DC: That&#8217;s great.
BM: Yeah, mostly working on a farm, so he took a public job.  So I grew up working a lot, and we worked on our place, and so I always felt a little--.  I rode the bus to school.  I always felt a little bit like an outsider in town.  I was a little uncomfortable in town because after all there were like five, six thousand people there.
DC: Right. [Laughs]
BM: But I went to church in town and went to school in town, and so we rode the bus home and that made us different from the town kids, and we had to work.  The town kids didn&#8217;t have to work like we did.
DC: What was your church affiliation?
BM: We were members of the First Baptist Church.  It was the biggest church in town.  I didn&#8217;t feel like an outsider there. But I think the reason I said that about feeling like an outsider, I think that has given me from the get-go a little bit of a sense of what it feels like to be an outsider. And I&#8217;ve often said that no matter where I go and no matter how I dress up, which I can -- if I dress up and I look in the mirror I think nobody can look at me and tell that I&#8217;m not like some rich lawyer or something.  I can look that way.  But I&#8217;ve always felt like I always carried the faint smell of hog shit, just a tiny little [bit], so that whenever I try to, quote, &#8220;get above my raisings,&#8221; you know, close quote, I always feel like you can sort of almost see somebody&#8217;s nostrils open up and thinking, man, that guy, I can smell the hog shit on him.  He&#8217;s putting on airs.
DC: [Laughs] Right.
BM: So I graduated from high school in Scottsboro.
DC: Right, and was that an all white high school experience?
BM: Oh, yeah.
DC: Yes.
BM: Oh, yeah.  It was an apartheid environment.  I grew up in an apartheid environment.  It was racially totally segregated.  I remember no incidents of violence, although my hometown, of course, is notorious for trying to murder or lynch nine African American young boys--they were teenagers--but that was never talked about, even though it only happened--.  We moved there in 1950.  It happened in &#8217;31, the incident.  That&#8217;s only nineteen years.  I used to think that was a long time but nineteen years is not--.
DC: No.

BM: For something that was an international incident.
DC: And it wasn&#8217;t discussed.
BM: Not at all.  I only heard of it like maybe twice growing up.  My sister didn&#8217;t even know about it until she went to Auburn to school.  She didn&#8217;t know anything about it, this international incident where people were marching in Sweden, you know what I mean, but here we were.  So I think growing up my class background had a heavy imprint, I think racial dynamics had a heavy imprint, and my religion, and of course my family, but those are external things outside my family that have a heavy imprint.  There were two rattletrap buses that came down our road.  Both of them stopped out in front of our house.  One of them was number seven, we rode that one; the other one was number twenty-seven, and the people across the road rode it.  They were African American and my parents wouldn&#8217;t let us associate with them.
DC: And they had their own farm?
BM: They farmed for another guy.
DC: Right.
BM: Ran his farm, but they were kids our age, and here we were out there and we didn&#8217;t have anybody to play with but my parents wouldn&#8217;t let us associate with them at all.  So all those stories that people tell about, &#8220;Yeah, up until we were twelve years old we were friends with the black kids, or we were friends with the white kids, we all got along, but then when we got to be twelve we couldn&#8217;t do it anymore, blah, blah, blah&#8221;; that didn&#8217;t happen to me.  It was from the get-go segregated, racial jokes, the mean comments, and then in the church it was all about why the religious underpinnings for why blacks and whites had to be separated because it was God&#8217;s will.
DC: You do remember that being discussed in church?
BM: Oh, yeah, the curse of Ham and on and on and on.  I mean it was everywhere.  It was in school, it was in church, it was at home, it was in the playground, it was in the air.  It was what you breathed, it was what you ate.  It was the environment that you lived in and it wasn&#8217;t like there was anything different.  And I often hear people who are Southerners, they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, you know, my parents, I would see things and at home they would say, yes, honey, but that just isn&#8217;t right.  You have to stand up.&#8221;  Or they may not say that, they may say, &#8220;Yes, but I had a minister who stood up and talked about racial justice and he got fired.&#8221;  Well that didn&#8217;t happen to me.  None of that happened to me.  I didn&#8217;t know any of those people. [Laughs] No white people stood up and made a stand that I knew, even through college.
DC: So when was that first disrupted for you then?  When did you first get the inkling that [Laughs] there was another way?
BM: Well, as soon as I sang, &#8220;Red and yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight,&#8221;--.  See, I was a real religious kid, and there were certain things that, you know, it&#8217;s like over and over, it&#8217;s like one is, you never follow the crowd.  Don&#8217;t follow the crowd.  You think for yourself.  You should stand up for what is right, even if you&#8217;re the only one, okay.  Then there was the, &#8220;Red and yellow, black and white, they are precious in His sight,&#8221; and then there was the way black people were treated around there.  Well my brother and I, he&#8217;s twenty-one months younger than me, we&#8217;d go in our room and it was like, &#8220;Why did Mama say we&#8217;re not supposed to say, &#8216;Yes, ma&#8217;am&#8217; and &#8216;No, ma&#8217;am&#8217; to her?&#8221; because I said, &#8220;Well, Mama, what&#8217;s Sally&#8217;s last name?&#8221;  Because one of the rules was you always say, &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; and, &#8220;No, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; to every adult woman, and you say, &#8220;No, sir,&#8221; and, &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; to every adult man, and you say, Mr. So-and-so and Mrs. So-and-so, and if you didn&#8217;t you would die.
DC: Right. [Laughs]
BM: You just did it.  And so, &#8220;What is her last name so I can call her something other than Sally?&#8221;  Well, Mother said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to call her by her last name.  You just call her Sally, and you don&#8217;t have to say, &#8216;Yes, ma&#8217;am.&#8217;&#8221;  So my brother and I were back there in our room, we&#8217;re like nine, ten, eleven years old, eight, seven, whatever it is.  It was like, &#8220;God, Wayne, what is that about?  I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;  So it wasn&#8217;t like anybody was helping us figure it out really, except unintentionally they were because they were sowing the seeds of the conflict.  The contradictions were there, in spite of the fact that they were trying to give you this picture of some kind of monolithic culture where whites are on top and blacks are on the bottom.
So I left high school.  My civics teacher was a right wing John Bircher and taught it and so, segregated, went to a segregated college at a segregated Baptist--.
DC: Which school?
BM: Samford.  The dean of women was publicly a member of the John Birch Society, Dean Sizemore.  I mean it wasn&#8217;t like, I wonder if she is really sort of right-wing; it&#8217;s like she was a member of the John Birch society.  She tried to get me, when I was in the spring of my junior year I think it was, to spy on--.  She tried--.  Well, anyway, she tried--.  She had me talk to an FBI agent to try to get me to be a spy for them, with a meeting of a communist student organization called SDS,--
DC: Right. [Laughs]
BM: --that were organizing in Birmingham.  So, anyway, we had right--.
DC: She wanted you to go underground.
BM: And be a spy, and I actually talked to an FBI agent.  She had me do that.
DC: But you--
BM: I didn&#8217;t--.
DC: --chose not to.
BM: I had to decide whether to or not because I thought maybe I should go and give them the names of some of the conservative students on campus.  That&#8217;s what I really wanted to do.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: But I thought I better not mess with these people.  I mean I don&#8217;t know--you know, they&#8217;re mean.
DC: Right.
BM: So I don&#8217;t want to play with them so I just said I don&#8217;t want to play with you.  We had speakers coming in.  There was a guy named Tom Anderson, or somebody.  These are Christian right wing preachers, like Swaggart-y or Swaggart and them, and all those guys, like these big evangelists that are right-wingers, so there was a heavy environment there.  I went to Samford--.  I even hate for the words to come out of my mouth, but I went to Samford in August or September of 1963, in Birmingham.  Well, what happened in Birmingham in September of 1963, anything of any particular importance?  Oh, yeah--four girls get bombed and killed in a Baptist church downtown.  That didn&#8217;t happen at Samford.  It didn&#8217;t exist.  That event didn&#8217;t happen, at all.  I mean--.
DC: Not discussed at all.
BM: Not discussed.  I was in Birmingham from 1963 to 1967 in this cocoon.  I would like to say I wasn&#8217;t.  I would like to say, oh, golly gee, I was out there, I went on the Selma march.  I didn&#8217;t go on the Selma march.  I didn&#8217;t know what it was about.  I didn&#8217;t understand it at all, you know.  I was a backwards--.  I mean I was in an educational institution.  I was scrambling to try and educate myself.  I was reading; we formed our own discussion groups to try to educate ourselves; we brought in our own speakers.  I became the president of the student government association my last year so I controlled the damn budget and we could pay people to come and educate us, and we did, you know.  But we didn&#8217;t march.
DC: Was it difficult to get news, to even find out what was going on?
BM: Yeah, I could have watched TV and read the news--.  Well the newspaper and the TV news, they&#8217;re not going to tell you anything.
DC: Right.
BM: Other than it happened, and then put a twist on it about some kind of communist plot.
DC: Right, outside agitators.
BM: Yeah, outside agitators, communist plot, I mean how would you find out, unless you got in your car and drove over into the black community and say, tell me what&#8217;s really going on--and people did that.  I&#8217;m not saying that people--but I was chicken shit or I just didn&#8217;t.  I didn&#8217;t know to.  I didn&#8217;t know how to.  I was a backwards kid from northeast--.  I was a hillbilly from northeast Alabama, one more outsider thing, by the way.  Hillbillies, we came from the mountains down to Birmingham to the big city and we talked funny.  Of course I thought all of them talked funny, but they looked--.
DC: That marked you as well.
BM: Yeah, they kind of looked down on us, but most of them, especially like the south Alabama people, who talk funny to us, they were more conservative, I think, now that I look at it, and us from north Alabama, most of the kind of student leaders by the last year were from north Alabama, because we were used to--.  I think culturally we were always outsiders.  We were rednecks, you know, to the planters and to the big city people.
DC: Sure.
BM: And so we were populists, with the ambiguities of all that.  So I think at Samford that&#8217;s where I really started--.  I mean I was a fundamentalist Southern Baptist ministerial student when I was eighteen.  I was licensed to preach when I was seventeen.  I preached my first sermon when I was seventeen.  I performed my first wedding when I was nineteen.  I was preaching in churches all over Alabama when I was eighteen and nineteen, because we would go out on Sundays and preach in Baptist churches, and so I was kind of on track to be like a Southern Baptist leader or something.
DC: So do you need to be formally ordained to preach like that?
BM: I was licensed.
DC: Licensed.
BM: There are two stages.  One is being licensed and one is being ordained, and I wasn&#8217;t ordained yet; I was just licensed.
DC: Okay, so you need the training first?
BM: You don&#8217;t have to be trained at all,--
DC: No, that&#8217;s just another step.
BM: --in fact in the Southern Baptists back then, and they still to this day, in a lot of rural churches, the rural churches were very suspicious of anybody who had been to seminary or even had a college degree.  Or if you went into one of these rural churches and you had notes to preach from that means that you weren&#8217;t being led by the spirit.  So I would kind of like hide my notes, you know what I mean?
DC: [Laughs] Right.
BM: I would put them in my Bible and I would open it up or something.
DC: Right.
BM: That&#8217;s the world I was in.  It was all white, it was all Southern Baptist, and they gave you the way to think about everything and punished you if you thought differently or acted differently.  But by the end of my sophomore year I was questioning a lot of the basic tenets, religious tenets, like who&#8217;s going to hell kind of thing.  Somebody who&#8217;s never heard about Jesus is going to hell?  What kind of God is that, and all that, so I began to really work on all that.  Just to make a long story short my religious views began to change and then I finally concluded that there wasn&#8217;t any such a thing as hell.  There was either a God or hell.  If there was God there couldn&#8217;t be hell and if there was hell there couldn&#8217;t be God, or a loving God.  So that was pretty radical.  So then I began to change and question a lot of stuff, and students--.  But I was still--.  I mean I wasn&#8217;t like a--.  I wasn&#8217;t seen by the students as a radical.  I was seen by the college, the president of the college, as sort of a radical, but I wasn&#8217;t at all.  It&#8217;s amusing when I look back and see what I was being reprimanded for.  I remember once being called to the president&#8217;s office and the dean of students coming out and saying, &#8220;Dr. Wright wants me to reprimand you for an article you wrote in the paper.  Consider yourself reprimanded.  I&#8217;ve got to go back in and tell him I reprimanded you.&#8221;
So, I was hungry, and a lot of us were hungry.  We were just hungry, hungry for learning.  There were no books written by any black authors in our bookstore.  There was nothing about African American history.  As far as I knew there were only two important black people in the history of America, and I&#8217;d never heard of W.E.B. DuBois.  So by the time I graduated from college I considered myself to be somewhat of an educated person.  I was trying to, you know.  And so then I was going to seminary and I had to make a decision about where to go to seminary and I prayed about it, and all my professors, of course, they wanted me to go--.  Like I said I was president of the student government.  I knew everybody, I was popular on campus, and all that stuff, you know, and of course they all wanted me to go to a Southern Baptist seminary, and I was thinking, God, I don&#8217;t know if I want to go to into this--you know?  I don&#8217;t want to be in this all my life.
DC: Where would that have been?  Would that have been--
BM: Louisville.
DC: --Louisville?  Yeah.
BM: The more, quote, liberal one.
DC: Okay. [Laughs] Right.
BM: Of course now they&#8217;ve taken to chopping the hands off of women and stuff like that.
DC: Right. [Laughs]
BM: I mean figuratively, not literally.  But so, I talked to a guy--.  There was a guy--and I know nothing about this man, I just remember his name.  His name was Dr. John Killinger and he taught at Vanderbilt, and I really didn&#8217;t learn who this man, I mean if he&#8217;s still alive.  I don&#8217;t know anything about him.  I should just Google the man and find out.  He came and spoke at an event at Samford and in his little bio it said he was a graduate of Union Seminary.  So I went up to him afterward and I said, &#8220;Dr. Killinger, can I talk to you just a minute?  I&#8217;m trying to decide what to do about seminary and I&#8217;m trying to decide about whether to go to Southern or to Union,&#8221; and he looked at me and he said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to go to Union.  You just have to.  You can&#8217;t go to Southern.  Go to Union.&#8221;  And that was the only person telling me to do it.  Of course, I&#8217;m reading this stuff--.  The books we had, you see, were by Neibuhr, or Tillich, and all these people.  I had a course on politics, systematic theology, reading Moral Man and Immoral Society by Niebuhr and stuff, and I&#8217;m thinking all these guys, so many of them are from Union.  None of them are from Southern Seminary, unless it&#8217;s something like a tract on why you shouldn&#8217;t dance, or something.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: So I made a decision, which was pretty stupid.  Every year Southern Seminary would give one scholarship to a student from each Baptist college.  I&#8217;m pretty sure it was each Baptist college, I know it was at Samford, but I&#8217;m pretty sure each one.  And so, they were looking for a certain kind of student, and I said to myself if Southern Seminary is looking for me then I may go there, because it&#8217;s pretty clear what I&#8217;m about, you know what I mean?
DC: Mm hmm.
BM: They&#8217;re going to contact the school administration and they&#8217;re going to say, what about this guy.  But I wasn&#8217;t a great student.  I wasn&#8217;t like a 4.0 student.  I was a good student.  I made As and Bs, I didn&#8217;t make any Cs, but I wasn&#8217;t one of these, you know.  So they decided to give the scholarship to this guy named Vesey, who was like an A student, a straight-laced guy, and I thought, okay.  All right.  That&#8217;s good.  That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re after, a straight-laced guy who makes all As.  They&#8217;re not after me.  That&#8217;s cool; I&#8217;m going to Union. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] Right.
BM: As I said earlier, the only way to explain to anybody now--.  Young people just go--.  They get in their car and they drive to Chicago or something, you know what I mean?  I mean people fly all over the world.  This was 1967 and people from Alabama did not go.  I mean in 1967, [for] people from New York, it was risky to drive through Alabama with a New York tag, and here I am going [there]?  It might as well have been Shanghai, Beijing, or something.
DC: Right.
BM: I mean, they spoke a different language, everything, culturally, all this stuff, and people just thought, well, we&#8217;ve lost that guy.  He&#8217;s dropped off the face of the earth.
DC: Do you remember talking to your family about going?
BM: I do.  I do, and my parents were--.  My dad&#8217;s still living and my mom is dead.  My parents were funny because they raised us to be independent, to be independent people.  They wanted us to be independent.  They did not want us to live at home.  They never even considered that we would stay in Scottsboro or look after them or whatever.  My dad is still that way.  He&#8217;s ninety-four and he doesn&#8217;t want help from any of us.  He lives alone, raises his own damn garden.  He busted his head last Monday because he went fishing by himself and fell and cracked his head.  Had to drive himself to the doctor with his hand over his eye because the blood was pouring into his right eye and he had to drive with his left eye.  Well, that was a little difficult, but by God he got there.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: Got sewed up and he&#8217;s doing better now.
DC: He&#8217;ll go fishing next week.
BM: Yeah.
DC: Right.
BM: So, they raised us like that, so when we made decisions they didn&#8217;t go like, well, okay, now wait just a minute here.  They just didn&#8217;t do it.  The only thing I remember--and this is a testament to my parents, who are these rural people from these little rural agrarian places--I was getting in the car with Bingham.  She was going to Penn State and I was going to Union and we were driving up together.  My mom came out to the car to say goodbye and she started crying and she said, &#8220;Billy, you take good care of yourself up there in that big city, and write when you can.&#8221;  What about that?  You can&#8217;t beat that.  You can&#8217;t beat that.  So, you know, I have this gratitude toward my parents for that.  So, anyway, that&#8217;s how I got to Union.
DC: So when did you and Bingham [his later wife] get together?
BM: We entered Samford at the same time.
DC: Okay.
BM: So we were there four years together.  She was a star.  I was a nobody redneck when we got there.  She put her toe on campus and people started throwing flowers at her.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: I mean really, it&#8217;s amazing.  It was amazing to everybody, but by the end of her sophomore year she&#8217;d won every honor that could be won.  By the end of my sophomore year I was still a redneck [laughs] who didn&#8217;t know shit from Shinola.
DC: But you went north together; she went to Penn and you went to Union.
BM: She went to Penn State and I went to Union and after a year we got married.  So I went to Union in &#8217;67.  So is this the way you want to--?
DC: Yeah, this is great.  Oh, absolutely.
BM: I can just talk about it if you want, but I want to make sure we&#8217;re going in the direction you want to go in.
DC: Absolutely on that.  I will definitely jump in.
BM: As soon as I got to Union, I mean, I was out of my element.  I really wanted to know how, I mean, there were several things I wanted to know.  One is I wanted to know how smart I was.  I was pretty sure but I wasn&#8217;t sure.  I knew there were a lot of people smarter than me at Samford, just smart, IQ smart.  I knew there were people that no matter how hard I tried I couldn&#8217;t be as smart as them.  But, I thought, I knew I was pretty smart too, you know what I mean?  And I was smart about figuring stuff out.  My dad, to this day if you were in a car with him riding down the road, he&#8217;ll look around and say, &#8220;Wonder why that guy built that fence that way?  Why didn&#8217;t he do it that way?  Why didn&#8217;t he put a big corner post right there and brace it instead of a little corner post and put his brace on the next post?&#8221; and he&#8217;s doing that all the time, so I&#8217;m doing that all the time.  So one of the things I wanted to know was how smart I was, and I kind of found out.  I found out there are a shitload of people smarter than me [Laughs] and a lot of them were at Union.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: And I learned that I had limited language ability, especially in writing.  I have a very, very poor writing background, and people who could just write and say what they wanted to say, put it in words--.  I spoke more in work pictures because of where I grew up.  I was used to--.  I mean you&#8217;d see people standing there and nothing in their entire body would move, and not even hardly their lips, just their tongue, and they&#8217;re speaking right there and all their words come from right at the front of their mouth, between their tongue and their teeth, nothing from their throat let alone from their gut.  And then everything they said was totally outlined and totally structured, not one single word picture, and I&#8217;m sitting here thinking, shit, I&#8217;m in China, you know?
DC: Well you&#8217;re a Southern Baptist preacher already. [Laughs]
BM: Oh, I know how to do it, you know, in the South.  You talk in pictures and you talk with your hands and you talk with emotion, and it comes out of your gut and your body and your eyes and everything, but this was an intellectual environment.  Not everybody was intellectual but there were a lot of intellectual people there.  I mean I survived; I didn&#8217;t fail or anything.  But it was a great experience.
DC: So what was, say, a homiletics class like for you?
BM: I didn&#8217;t have homiletics.
DC: You didn&#8217;t do that.
BM: Mm mm, because I--
DC: I was wondering if they would--.
BM: --didn&#8217;t think I was going to go into preaching at that point.
DC: Oh, okay.  I was wondering what that would have been like. [Laughs]
BM: Yeah, it would have been interesting.  They would have tried to probably mold me.  They wouldn&#8217;t--.  Up in there it was very rare for seminary students to preach.  It was like a big deal if on a special day a seminarian was preaching at one of the churches.  Well, God, I&#8217;d been preaching since I was seventeen.  It seemed weird to me.
So, some big things that happened as far as my development, I guess you&#8217;d say, was right off the bat I wanted to intern in East Harlem.  I knew there was important things about the world that I wanted to know about that I could not learn in the South, and that was about what had happened with African Americans and what was happening in the South.  So the church bombing happened to me in 1967.  It happened to the girls and to the church in 1963.  But historically it didn&#8217;t happen in my life, you know, consciously, of course emotionally there was upheaval in the society and all that, but it didn&#8217;t happen until 1967.  So I started working in East Harlem.  A couple of the guys I got to be friends with, they were working in black communities.  I was opening a gym in the basement of a church, so I was hanging out--.  While some students said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a community organizer,&#8221; with this or that--I didn&#8217;t learn until later that that was bullshit because they didn&#8217;t know how to do community organizing in the black community.  They were just arrogant.  I was not arrogant, I guarantee you.  I didn&#8217;t have anything to be arrogant about.  I just thought I&#8217;m going to try to take what I can chew here, so it turned out later that the guy who hired me, the minister there, he told me at the end that he&#8217;d had doubts whether to hire me because he wasn&#8217;t sure, with me coming out of Alabama and with my background, how I could handle it.  What happened was I got over there and it turned out, shit, these people talk like me.  They eat the same food I do.  Then with the kids they would say, &#8220;Where you from?&#8221; and I would say, &#8220;I&#8217;m from down South.&#8221;  I&#8217;d start out saying I&#8217;m from Alabama, and then they&#8217;d say, &#8220;Alabama, ain&#8217;t that down South?&#8221; and I&#8217;d say, &#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s down South,&#8221; so then I&#8217;d just say I&#8217;m from down South.  They&#8217;d say, &#8220;Well all my people are from down South.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a place, you know, &#8220;down South.&#8221;  It&#8217;s right outside Birmingham.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: Or whatever.  To them it was.
DC: Right.
BM: And so all these seminarians that were the intellectuals and went to, say, Yale or Oberlin, and came in from Ohio, and they&#8217;re from Detroit or whatever, they were like a lost dog in high weeds, you know.  I mean certainly it was a radical experience for me but I clicked with the people and they took care of me.
DC: You said you started working there right away, after you got to Union?
BM: I started working there right off the train, you might say, so that was a pretty big deal, because I&#8217;d never worked in a black community, but I was ready for it.  I was looking for this.  Around that same time there was a black professor, his name was Eric Lincoln.  Are you familiar with that name?
DC: I am.
BM: He went to Duke later, right?
DC: Mm hmm.
BM: Eric Lincoln at that time had written a book called Black Muslims in America and--.
DC: He was probably Larry Mamiya&#8217;s mentor.  I think he definitely was.
BM: Well Lincoln, I don&#8217;t know if that was his first year.  It may have been.  So Mamiya would have hooked up with him right--
DC: The same time.
BM: --around that same time.  So I go into Dr. Lincoln. I&#8217;m this redneck kid from north Alabama, and I go into him and I say, &#8220;Dr. Lincoln, I am from Alabama.  I went to a segregated school.  I want to learn.  I want to read books by and about black people, because this was not available to me.&#8221;  Well that was a little bit hard for me to do because of who I am.  I like to try and portray myself as being together, and I was clearly betraying myself to him right off the bat as totally not together.  Basically I was saying I don&#8217;t know my butt from third base and are you willing to help me.  Well this man--did you meet him?  Did you know him?
DC: No.
BM: This man could have laughed me out of the room.  In fact what he said was, &#8220;Where are you from in Alabama?&#8221; and I told him I&#8217;m from north Alabama and he said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m from north Alabama too.&#8221;  And he said, &#8220;Where?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Scottsboro.&#8221;  Of course any black person, especially older people, you say you&#8217;re from Scottsboro, [exhales loudly], you know.  So for a double reason he could have easily said, would you please leave my office.  I mean, you know.
DC: Right.
BM: And yes, was my family living in Scottsboro in 1931?  No.  Would they have been in the mob downtown on the courthouse if they had been?  Some of them would have been.  So he could have so easily said, you know, I&#8217;ve got too much baggage here.  I can&#8217;t deal with this.  He told me a story about being a kid and being cheated, I think it was picking cotton, and being cheated out of the weighing of the cotton by a white guy, and he talked to me some about his experiences about being a black kid in Athens, and then he says, &#8220;So what do you want to read?&#8221; and I told him.  He said--I will never forget this--&#8220;Well do you want to read books by black philosophers?  Do you want to read books by black sociologists?  Do you want to read books by black psychologists?  Do you want to read books by black poets?  Do you want to read books by black novelists?  Do you want to read books by black scientists?  Just exactly what--?&#8221;  And I&#8217;m sitting there going like,--
DC: What? [Laughs]
BM: --there are those?  I mean I didn&#8217;t know this.
DC: Right.
BM: Because all this had been removed from me.  A person who was hungry to be educated in Alabama, all that whole realm of the world had been totally censored out of my life by the people who were trying to train me to be a young racist.  And so I began to read. I did a paper on lynchings, and I didn&#8217;t know anything about all that.  They were naming these towns that maybe I&#8217;d preached in, maybe some of my family lived in, or whatever.  The Freedom Riders bus was burned in Anniston.  My sister lived there, not then but right after that, and she would talk about, oh, Anniston&#8217;s such a great place, it&#8217;s so open about race relations and everything, and it was like, oh, okay, well then why did they try to cook all those people in the bus?
So all this I&#8217;m learning.  I&#8217;m going to the Schoenberg Collection and reading about stuff and I was just hungry for it because it was like, God, look at all this!  I was just eating it up and it was just, you know, changing the way I saw myself in the world and where I grew up and everybody I knew and every place I&#8217;d been and every institution I&#8217;d been a part of.  It was just revolutionary in my life.  So I began to come to an understanding that for there to be a racist structure it was built certainly on the oppression of blacks, but on another level, and not similar in any way in magnitude or type, there had to be oppression of the young white kids.  We had to be lied to about who we were.  It was psychological--.  I mean it was oppression of us and, excuse me, but it pissed me off.
DC: Yeah.
BM: At my religion professors--.  We had a course in Christian ethics, this marvelous Mabry Lunsford who was such a warm and friendly--.  We never talked about race, and here we were in Alabama in 1965, 1966, in Birmingham, in a Christian ethics course, and nothing is said about race?  Good grief!  Or the KKK or lynchings or people just trying to exercise their rights to vote.  So, you know, I developed some real anger about that and I began to understand that this same structure that oppressed black people oppressed me.  I to this day feel that way and so I see myself as somebody who part of who I am is to try to unravel that.  That&#8217;s off the Union thing, but that&#8217;s a big strain in my--.
I was working in East Harlem when Dr. King was killed.  There were riots across 125th Street.  They called me and told me not to come to work that night.  I think he may have been killed on a--I&#8217;m not sure--maybe a Thursday or something, but they told me not to come the next time I was supposed to open the gym.  Then one of the kids--he was a sixteen-year-old drug dealer--he called me and said, &#8220;Bill, have you heard about what happened over here?&#8221;  We were on the edge of Harlem anyway, Union is.  [I said,] &#8220;Yeah, yeah.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;s a mess.  You ought to come see it.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Ruben, are you crazy?  Some white guy go walk down 125th Street the day after a riot?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I tell you what, I&#8217;ll come and get you and we&#8217;ll walk down 125th Street and I&#8217;ll guarantee you nobody will bother you.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;All right,&#8221; so we did that, and that was pretty big for me.  I was twenty-two years old, something like that.
Another thing that was big for me was a couple times I walked to work, because instead of being inside a bus I just wanted to be out there a little bit, just to sort of smell and feel and whatever, so I walked down 125th Street, and there was a guy, I believe his name was Charles &#8220;X&#8221; Kenyatta, if I remember right.  He would stand on top of a car near the corner of I think Lenox and 125th, but it was near 125th, and he was trying to be the successor to Malcolm X, because Malcolm X had only been killed a couple years before, right, &#8217;65, I think.  So this guy would stand on top of a car and wave a machete, that was his thing, and he would talk about death to the whities.  Here I am walking down 125th Street with this guy waving a damn machete [Laughs] talking about whities and Brother Malcolm and all this stuff, and I&#8217;m thinking, so this is what it feels like.  This is what it feels like.  Any people here could come up to me and spit in my face and slap my face and tell me to get down on my knees and kiss their shoe, especially if there's a group of them, and there would be absolutely nothing I could do, and then I thought, I&#8217;m beginning to get the picture.  This is what it feels like to live in a tiny little way, just a tiny, tiny little snapshot, of what it feels like to be black and live in a white environment where every day is like that, but where people actually are making you do that.  Nobody did that to me.  In fact after King died the first night that I went over to open the gym and then I closed the gym and all the kids hung around afterward and they said, &#8220;Hey, man, we&#8217;re going to wait around and walk you up to the bus.&#8221;  I said, &#8220;No, that&#8217;s okay.  Y&#8217;all go ahead.&#8221;  They looked at me and they said, &#8220;Bill, we&#8217;re walking you to the bus and we&#8217;re waiting with you until the bus comes.&#8221;  So, those are just things you never forget, you know?  Anyway, very emotional to me.
DC: Yeah.  Did you continue working in that community?
BM: I worked there for the year, and at the end of the year--.  Back to the rest of the story about Dr. Lincoln: At the end of that year in the spring Dr. Lincoln said, &#8220;You know, Bill, I&#8217;m on a board of a foundation that makes grants to students.  They make grants to students who are black and Indian and Puerto Rican and from&#8221;--I remember this--&#8220;from Guam and Samoa and Appalachia.  Why don&#8217;t you apply?&#8221;  I had never applied--.  I mean I had scholarships in college but I never had filled out like an essay.  I had to write something, I don&#8217;t remember what.  And he got it for me.  That&#8217;s another one of those experiences that I&#8217;m very emotional about because I think how did this man do that?  And it was part of my growth.  It was an important moment in my growth that this guy was able to do that for this redneck kid, trained to be a racist, who grew up in Scottsboro, Alabama, of all places.  So, anyway.
That was the end of my first year [at Union.]  The next year I worked just a sort of innocuous job with some young people down in the lower East Side.  There was anti-war activity all that time and at Union there was--.  Oh, no, then there was Columbia in the spring.  See there was King&#8217;s death, and Columbia and Kennedy&#8217;s death all came real close.
DC: Right.
BM: I went over with--.
DC: So within a month, yeah.
BM: Yeah, and so I went over there to rallies and heard Phil Ochs sing, &#8220;The War Is Over!&#8221; and stuff like that, and heard the SDS people and heard the speeches and the music and the power of it.  And there was the challenge about the gymnasium being built at the edge of Harlem and it was all bound up in this, as well as the war contracts.  But I didn&#8217;t go occupy a building or anything, you know, just going to stuff.  And then we had an agreement that--.  I don&#8217;t know how this was reached but we all understood that if the police were to come we were all going to be caught, and I guess there was a list of us or what, I don&#8217;t know, but the understanding is that some of us would go over there to be supportive if the police came, so that call came and we went.  I remember my roommate and I went and we were out in the big quadrangle at Columbia and the police came streaming in from Amsterdam.  We later understood there were twenty buses with fifty cops in each, a thousand cops, and they started wading into people, slinging their clubs and horses running people down.  I ran out down to 116th Street gate there, these big iron gates.  I don&#8217;t know if you know that place?
DC: I do, yeah.
BM: The entrance to the quadrangle there, and I was able to climb up that thing and hang up at the top of it while the police were running people down.
DC: Because they were coming through--.
BM: Coming through from Amsterdam, from the other side, running people through and horses running down the street, running people down, and there I was, clinging up here in this, you know, place.
DC: When you got that call were you all supposed to be there as Union students or as--
BM: I think we were just--.  I don&#8217;t think we were playing any--.
DC: --seminarians?
BM: I don&#8217;t remember us being asked to play any particular role.
DC: Okay.
BM: I think we were just there--.
DC: Just to support.
BM: I mean my memory is just to support, right, or at least me.  I was not involved in any of the leadership of that.  I was just a participant.
DC: Okay.
BM: And as well as the anti-war stuff, I saw maybe Bob [Hall] and Ron Phillips and some of those guys.  My earliest memory of them is getting on the elevator, and I always say this to Bob: It was like they were wearing army jackets and the collars were turned up and they would be growling at each other, &#8220;Grrrrr, Grrrrrr, war, revolution, revolution and oppression.&#8221;
DC: [Laughs]
BM: And then one of them would say, &#8220;Yeah, yeah, war, revolution, and oppression to people power,&#8221; you know, and the other one would growl back, and I&#8217;m sitting here, this kid from Alabama, and I&#8217;m going--whoa!
DC: [Laughs]
BM: So all that was huge to me.  I got married that summer.  The next year was maybe a little more--.  I don&#8217;t know when all--the black church manifesto and all that.  That may have been that next year.
DC: &#8217;69, yeah.
BM: Was it &#8217;69?
DC: Mm hmm.
BM: Spring of &#8217;69.
DC: Mm hmm.
BM: So that was when we had a strike ourselves in the rotunda and had different people teaching.  As I said earlier some of us Southerners were meeting together during that time to talk about the unique oppression of the South.
DC: Now were there many Southern students at Union?
BM: There were probably--.  We would meet sometimes and we had sort of an informal--.  Willie Morris, the guy who wrote--.  He was from Mississippi, from Yazoo, Mississippi.  He became editor of--Esquire, or something?  No, no, not Vanity Fair--Harper&#8217;s or something.  So anyway, he came and met with us and he&#8217;d written a book about growing up in Mississippi, and so basically we were just supporting one another in an environment--.  I mean it was nice to get together with people who didn&#8217;t talk with an accent, you know.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: So, anyway, we would eat together and stuff and then maybe read a book and talk about it.  Then--.
DC: Can you tell me a little bit more, because we were talking off tape about those kinds of discussions that you would have.
BM: With the Southerners?
DC: Yeah.
BM: Well we would talk about the corporate oppression of the South, coal mine companies, lumber companies, steel, the carpetbaggers, and there was a touch of sort of Southern nationalism in it, a little bit, kind of militant Southernism, I guess you&#8217;d say to a degree.  It was sort of like affirming who we were, but the fact that being from the South at Union Seminary in the late &#8217;60s was probably the most un-cool thing you could possibly be.  In an intellectual environment at that time there was nobody that it was cool to be prejudiced toward except white Southerners.  I mean that was just totally, totally okay, and happened.  People would make fun of the way you talked.  I remember talking with some people one time and they talked about, &#8220;What was it like growing up in Alabama?&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Well you know we were real poor, Daddy never could find a job, we didn&#8217;t have a mule so we had to pull the plow ourselves, I didn&#8217;t see a pair of shoes until I went to school and saw other kids wearing shoes,&#8221; and the more people believed what I was saying the more pissed off I got at them.
DC: [Laughs] And you just kept piling it on, right.
BM: Because I thought--.  I mean I got mad at them.  Here I was lying and they were believing what I said and I was getting mad at them.  I remember getting so mad at them because it fit so much their stereotype.
DC: Sure.
BM: So we were in an environment where we were just trying to affirm who we were as Southerners and what&#8217;s positive about that, and we were all white.  I don&#8217;t think there were any black Southerners.  There was a guy from Texas and a guy from Oklahoma.  Sam Roberts was from Oklahoma.  He was a friend.  But I don&#8217;t remember anybody from the South.
DC: Was Willie Smith there?  You may--?
BM: Yeah!
DC: [Laughs]
BM: From Georgia?
DC: He had been in Texas.  I don&#8217;t know where he was raised.
BM: Willie Smith.  Willie--.
DC: J. Smith.
BM: A real gentle guy.  Wait just a minute.  But he wasn&#8217;t there long, was he?  Who is he?
DC: Well, I can tell you a little bit more about him, if it&#8217;s the same guy.  I think it&#8217;s the right years.
BM: It was Willie, his name was Willie.  He was not a close friend but we had some really significant conversations together.  If I remember, if it&#8217;s the guy, he was a very gentle, very gentle-speaking guy.  I really liked him a lot.  Unpretentious.
DC: The Willie that I met, which is obviously many years later, was not a gentle speaking guy, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not the same guy.
BM: He was slim.  Gosh, that&#8217;s amazing.  I hadn&#8217;t even thought about him.  Yeah, because he was from--.  Did he say if he was from Texas?
DC: Had gone to school in Texas anyway.
BM: Okay, okay.  Wow.
DC: I can tell you more about him later.
BM: So anyway, being married and -- you know, that was a whole other thing -- so I was like, you know, but still I was a part of this--.  There was still a lot of change going on in my life.  I was not a leader.  I mean I was sort of a little bit of a leader in that Southern group but I was not one of these people that was negotiating with the faculty and all that stuff.  I was just a student.  I took off a year and went--.  Because I felt like I was getting so wrapped up in war, and oppression, and international this, and Vietnam, and racism, and I was like losing touch with what was happening to real people.  So I took a year and I went and did what&#8217;s called clinical pastoral education.  I went and worked in a hospital basically doing counseling in their chaplain department in Houston.  And that was my first time to cross the Mississippi River.  And while I was there I would, once a week or so, go down and volunteer to work on what was called an underground newspaper, the Space City News.  By then I was outside of New York so it was like I was beginning to--.  How can I say this?  In New York my identity was shaped by the fact that I was in this intellectual environment that was very, very activist, [a] very highly charged activist environment, and I was not one of the main activists.  Yeah, I mean I would go on the marches or I went over to Columbia.  I was a participant.  But then when I left Union and went to Houston it was like all of a sudden I began to realize--how can I say this?--that I&#8217;d taken a lot of that with me, that I was an activist, and that I was beginning to identify with the New Left.  I began to identify as somebody who wanted to see revolutionary change.  I didn&#8217;t consider myself as a revolutionary in terms of I&#8217;ve got my AK-47 in a closet and I&#8217;m ready to use it any time, but I certainly was supportive of the Cuban revolution and stuff like that, internationally understood and was identifying more with the Vietnamese than with the US government&#8217;s policy in Vietnam and &#8220;Ho Ho Ho Chi Minh&#8221; and all that.  And so all that had had more of an impact on me than I knew until I got away from it and realized that I didn&#8217;t leave it.  I was carrying it inside of me, with me.  It was a part of me by then.  And so, at Space City News I wrote a little bit but not much and then I was hanging around those people, just helping out a little bit, and again I wasn&#8217;t trying to aspire to be the editor of the paper or anything; I was just trying to help people out.  And in the chaplaincy department, it was a big program there and they began to see me--.  I was the Leftist, you know.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: You know, come on people.  You got to meet Ron Phillips and Bob [Hall].
DC: Right. [Laughs]
BM: They eat babies for breakfast.  They don&#8217;t talk, they growl.  So, but I went on a couple marches there, and so it was real educational, and I don&#8217;t think I got involved in anything other than Space City really, that I can think of there, and a march or two.  But then I went back to Union for my last year.
DC: Okay.
BM: And then James Cone [the &#8220;father&#8221; of Black Theology] was there.
DC: He had just arrived, right.
BM: And I think Lincoln had gone, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, or maybe--.  I don&#8217;t know.  Anyway, I didn&#8217;t stay connected with Lincoln.  He was having an affair with one of my friends anyway, but that&#8217;s--. [Laughs] That was interesting.  What?  She was a skinny little Italian girl.  He was this big giant--you know he was real heavy, and I just thought, Prudence?
Anyway, so then I take a black theology of liberation course.  There&#8217;s a guy named Henri Mottu from Switzerland.  He had a course on the theology of hope.  And then there was this guy named Rubem Alves from Brazil.  He was the one that probably--.  Cone&#8217;s stuff was, I thought, kind of pop theology a little bit.  He had sort of one idea that he pushed, at least at that time, and I haven&#8217;t kept up with it, but basically he said to be Christian you have to be black.  That&#8217;s what he said.  Wow.  Golly, you know, the white students were, &#8220;Whoa!  Whoa!  You mean I can&#8217;t be a Christian?&#8221;  And he was like to be Christian you got to be black; deal with it.  It&#8217;s sort of like the thing about only white people can be racist, kind of thing.  All of them are talking about, you know, liberation theology and they were rooting it in the Bible and whenever you ask the children of Israel, who are you, who are the Jews, or who is your God, and they would say, &#8220;We were slaves in the land of Egypt and we were delivered, crossed the Red Sea--.&#8221;  They&#8217;d tell this story, and it&#8217;s like, wait, wait, wait.  I want to know what your God is like.  &#8220;We were slaves in Egypt;--
DC: [Laughs]
BM: --we were delivered; we crossed the Red Sea; we came to the land of milk and honey; we wandered forty years in the wilderness.&#8221;  It was all about what had happened to them in history, and so I began to come to this real clear understanding from my point of view that what God was, was whenever you saw love happening, whenever you saw justice happening, whenever you saw freedom happening, that was God at work.  You want to know what God is like, there it is right there.  See that woman taking care of her baby?  See these people marching down against the war?  There&#8217;s God, right there.  That&#8217;s who God is.  And so God was basically this force that actually moves through history and we can be a part of that or not, and a lot of times we&#8217;re part of it even when we say we&#8217;re not, but if we say we are and we&#8217;re intentional about it we can be more a part of it.
So that&#8217;s sort of my simple theology in ninety seconds, and it is to this day, and so I guess I kind of got saturated that last year, because there was Wink and Alves and Mottu and Cone, and then, as if that were not enough, why don&#8217;t we parachute over into East Harlem where the Young Lords Party had just seized a Methodist church.  Well, they didn&#8217;t really seize it.  They explained it as having a revival.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: They were reviving the Methodist church.  So I was with a group of people, of students, that were doing support work for the Young Lords Party.
DC: Wow, yeah.
BM: And we would go over there to the church and on at least one night we were at--.  They tried to have ministers and seminarians spend the night in the church every night.  This was a bit of a learning experience, a bit, because what they did is they told the police, okay, we know you&#8217;re out there--and they were.  We got real people.  One hundred percent people are in here, not just Puerto Rican young people, like sixty percent human, but one hundred percent human, real white people.
DC: White seminarians.
BM: White seminarians, and not only are they in here but we are sitting in front of the barricaded door, inside the barricaded door.  The Young Lords guy is sitting there with a carbine and right beside him is sitting a real one hundred percent seminarian, and if you come bashing through this door with your guns blazing you&#8217;re going to kill the seminarian.  And we did that.  I did that.  I sat there, talking with the dude and all this stuff.  Well that was educational.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: That had not happened on Old Larkinsville Road in Jackson County, Alabama before.
DC: Right.
BM: The Puerto Rican community [in Alabama] was quite small. [Laughs]
DC: [Laughs]
BM: So, anyway, and what happened out of that, there was a small group of us--.
DC: So--.
BM: Go ahead.
DC: Yeah, I don&#8217;t want to let you go.
BM: No, that&#8217;s all right.  I won&#8217;t lose that piece.
DC: So how do you process that at that time?  How do you make that part of your theological education or your growth experience?
BM: Well they had breakfast programs for kids, they were teaching kids about Puerto Rican history; they were teaching people about US imperialism, about liberation.  They were tying together international oppression, you know.
DC: So it fit?
BM: Yeah, it fit me.  Theology of liberation: That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re studying.  The dude from Brazil [Leondardo Boff], you know, this was it in practice here.  And so I saw what they were doing was they were trying to create revolutionary change.  They weren&#8217;t trying--.  Of course they wanted independence for Puerto Rico, but in that place right then what they were doing was running programs out of there for the community and people were responding.  There were two parts to that.  One was there was a big effort I think to get the Methodist Church to give them the building, or at least to call the police off, and so there was negotiations with the Methodist Church.  I was in on one or two of those, just in a minor role.  Then there were people in another denomination, Presbyterian, that like sent a group of the Young Lords Party to the--.  As I recall the annual conference of the Methodist Church was in California and they actually paid for--.  Some Presbyterian, one of the Presbyterian guys at the &#8220;God Box&#8221; paid for them to fly to California, the Young Lords reps, so they could deal with the Methodists and stuff.
But one of the most important pieces of that is that the Young Lords party saw us as being important people, and I think it was once a week we had a study group and they sent a representative, one of their smart people, and we would talk ideas.  If I&#8217;m not mistaken his name was Juan Gonz&#225;lez, but again my disconnect with that now, it&#8217;s like when I left there I really left, you know.  But later I picked up a book--I wish I could remember the name of it--about the experiences of Latinos from different countries, like the unique experiences of the Dominicans, their unique experience in this country, and how differently they see one another, and class wise the Columbians are here and the Haitians are there--of course they&#8217;re not Latino, but--.  Or say the Columbians are here and maybe Puerto Ricans are a class difference, and stuff like that.  I thought, I recognize this name, and I looked on the back--.
DC: It was him.
BM: It was him.  He&#8217;s an intellectual and he was the guy that was meeting with us.
DC: Right.
BM: I can&#8217;t even remember anybody who was in that group other than Rick, the guy that worked with NACLA, the North American Congress on Latin America--Rick Edwards.  I think Rick Edwards was in that group.  So by this time now, I mean like, okay, my education had been put on fast forward.  I was just like [Sound effect], you know.  All this was coming at me.  All that I mentioned was in the space of nine months.
DC: What year was that?
BM: That was &#8217;70, &#8217;71.  Then that fall I went to Bossey Institute.  The World Council of Churches had this institute in Switzerland and I went there and there were thirty-five students from sixteen countries, or something.  It was a very kind of conservative environment.  In fact the guy that ran the place was Greek and his wife was like from some rich Greek family.  Well this was during the time of the colonels, so one time I organized some people, Greek resistance types, to come out and talk. [Laughs] They hated it.
DC: [Laughs] Right.
BM: They just hated it, because this is Europe.  Everything&#8217;s done properly.  Well, hell, I was this redneck kid from--.
DC: This is in Geneva?
BM: Well it was out in the rural area, yeah, near Geneva.
DC: Yeah, okay.
BM: And so at Union there&#8217;d been a paper written like, &#8220;Who Rules Union?&#8221;  There was a paper written about who rules Union.  It grew from a paper called, &#8220;Who Rules Columbia?&#8221;  It was like the corporate world, and see at Union there were these big Rockefeller people and all this, so he was raising the question of: Who are we serving?  We think we&#8217;re revolutionaries and whatever, but how do we fit into their big plan?  So, who rules Union, who rules the &#8220;God Box,&#8221; the Interfaith Church Center, and all that stuff.  So I get to--.
DC: So this was a paper that was distributed--?
BM: Yeah, around Union.  I&#8217;ve probably got a copy.  I should have a copy of &#8220;Who Rules Union?&#8221; upstairs somewhere.  I didn&#8217;t do it.  But then when I got to Switzerland and we&#8217;d go visit the World Council of Churches I thought, there are these same daggone names on these buildings and auditoriums and stuff.
DC: Right.
BM: And I thought, wait just a minute.  What&#8217;s the deal here?  So then I found out these are the same people that found the World Council of Churches and the UN, and Union and Columbia, and it&#8217;s like, wait, what&#8217;s the picture here?  So then I began to learn about this internationalism thing, you know, with corporate America.  I had this whole big picture of internationalism and how this was sort of [like] liberal corporate America.
DC: The liberal world order, yeah.
BM: Not the rich people in Houston. [Laughs]
DC: Right.
BM: No, not those guys.  They were funding the militias, you know what I mean?
DC: Right.
BM: I&#8217;m talking about the ones that kind of had the bigger picture.  So funding the new world order and making sure that churches were out there and their people were in the churches and, whew, boy I mean it was like, Whoaaa buddy, you know?  So I started doing research on the World Council of Churches and hook or crook I got into the archives.  I mean it was through being a student, so I wrote a paper on the World Council of Churches and about who all these people were, and I found different kind of tidbits of information.  Meanwhile, well during my last year at Union there was another dynamic.  I was hanging out at Liberation News Services.  You know who that is, LNS?
DC: Not really.
BM: Okay, okay.  All across the country--I mentioned Space City News--it was called an underground newspaper.  Every city had an underground newspaper.
DC: Right.
BM: Jackson, Mississippi had Kudzu.  There was--oh, God, I should remember all these--Austin, I mean, you know, San Francisco, they all had the underground newspapers, and they were serviced by a news service that sent a weekly packet with graphics and news stories, and that was Liberation News Services, and they were located in a basement on Claremont Avenue, which was out the back door of my apartment building where I lived at Union.  And so I started going over there and I would hang out over there, because I&#8217;d been at Space City News, I mean I&#8217;d hung around Space City News, and so it was like, &#8220;Well, I was at Space City News a little bit, and do you all know them?&#8221;  &#8220;Yeah, we know Judy and--.  Yeah, yeah.&#8221;  &#8220;Well I used to hang out with Judy and them,&#8221; and stuff.  And so like--.  [Telephone rings] Let&#8217;s see what this is.  [Break in recording]
DC: Okay.
BM: [Telephone rings] So really again--. [Answering machine picks up] They won&#8217;t leave a message.  Again I wasn&#8217;t trying to be the leader of LNS.  I was just hanging out there.  I was helping them out.  In fact I remember they wanted me to organize all their papers they got from all around--they had stacks of them from all over the country because what happened is they would reciprocate. So they said we&#8217;ll send you LNS if you&#8217;ll send us your paper so they had to file all the papers. And then they were throwing a bunch of them away. Well, I got some of them, and now that I look back, I mean I wish I had gotten all of them.  I mean, what a treasure. So I tried to get one from each city. So I&#8217;ve got them here somewhere, I mean I probably only have a dozen or ten or so. So that was a part of my education because then I was seeing what was going on all around the country, you know, stuff that wouldn&#8217;t be in the national news would be in Liberation News Service. So they liked me and I liked them personally, we got along, and I was helping them out just doing grunt work or whatever. So when I went to Europe, guess what, they sent it to me. I got LNS at Bossey Institute out in this rural area of Switzerland!  And I kept them for a long time.  The graphics were fabulous.  And so here I was reading the LNS out there in this chateau in Switzerland and then doing research in the archives and then going to these really innocuous, stupid classes that really weren&#8217;t very good. But it gave me a view looking back at the US, literally. It is amazing how being in another country, and talking to other people, you begin to see it how they see it. Especially the war in Vietnam and U.S. imperialism and all this kind of stuff and stuff that other people just assume.  I mean, heck, it might take me five years to get to some conclusion and they were born with it, because they knew it all along.  And so, that was a big education for me.  After that.
DC: Was that a one year fellowship?
BM: It was about four-and-a-half months and then Bingham and I traveled around Europe for about six weeks or something. And then came back to Switzerland while I finished up my research on that paper.  And the deal was that NACLA &#8211; North American Congress on Latin America &#8211; was going to print a book and that was going to be a chapter.  So I went back to New York and finished. We lived on the floor of some apartment &#8211; I think it may have been Rick Edwards&#8217;s apartment, I&#8217;m not sure &#8211; for like a month while I finished writing it. By then I was totally exhausted.
So then Bingham and I, we wanted to come back to the South, but we didn&#8217;t know where to go.  To make a long story shorter, we basically traveled around the South talking to people, because we&#8217;d both been gone from the South and a lot had happened.  Besides, the contacts we had were totally worthless.  &#8220;Oh yeah, this preacher at Dawson Memorial Baptist Church in Homewood, Alabama, let&#8217;s go see him! I mean, what good is that going to do?&#8221; Any contact we had before we left the South was totally worthless.
DC: Right. Where was she from?
BM: Talladega, Alabama.
DC: Okay. Oh, wow! Alright.
BM: Where Talladega college is.
DC: Yeah. The very first year of the Student Interracial Ministry, that was one of the places they went, in 1960.
BM: To Talladega?  DC: To Talladega.  BM: To a church?  DC: Yeah.  BM: Wow!  DC: Yeah, there was a white seminarian who served with a black seminarian from Gammon who had either one or a couple of circuit churches in Taladega.  BM: Wow! Wow! How &#8216;bout that!  DC: So I have stuff on that, too.  BM: Oh God. So, Bingham needs to know that.  DC: Because that&#8217;s where the Grand Dragon of the [Ku Klux] Klan lived, in Taladega, Alabama.  BM: Robert Shelton?  I don&#8217;t know.  It was an ugly place. I mean, her dad was a working class guy.  Her mom was from &#8220;the Bingham family&#8221; and grew up, I guess, at Binghamwood.  Which was a big house with a bunch of acres, within the city limits. It was woods by that time and the house was empty, but this big house with all this land in the city limits of Talladega.  I mean, I had not been close to southern aristocracy. Scottsboro didn&#8217;t have southern aristocracy!  And as Daddy and I were talking about last week, even rich people in Scottsboro, they&#8217;d be driving an old beat up pickup and live in a little house.  You just didn&#8217;t do that. Y ou just didn&#8217;t show off your wealth.  Now in South Alabama, they built palaces and wore silk shirts and drove the biggest cars and all that stuff, but you didn&#8217;t do that in North Alabama. It wasn&#8217;t acceptable behavior, you know?  And now I&#8217;m around, these are these big houses, with the columns a little bit, and their family and her mom&#8217;s attitudes.  And I wasn&#8217;t quite good enough.  Well, where I was from it was who you were, really, that made you whether you were good enough or not.  What were you doing with yourself?  Well, I mean, yeah, who were your people? But, were they bank robbers?  No.  They worked every day.  I mean did they paint their house and the paint wasn&#8217;t peeling?  Yeah.  Did they go to church?  [Yeah.]  Well then, hell, marry the guy!  Has he got a decent job?  Yeah.  Fine.  Well, it turned out there was this question about whether I was good enough because I wasn&#8217;t from the right stock or whatever.  Well, I had been president of the student government association at my college, you know!  I mean, I thought, this was of course, I mean I thought I&#8217;d done pretty damn good for myself growing up where the things smell of pig shit on me!  So, I began to learn.  So her uncle, Uncle Archer, he took me out to eat at the country club before we got married.  He wanted to have a little &#8211; he fancied himself to be an educated man &#8211; so he kind of wanted to impress me with his thinking.  So one of the things he threw out there as he was being all genteel, was, you know, Bill, something about modern medicine, on of its flaws.  &#8220;One of the great things about modern medecine was that it has added to our longevity and it&#8217;s helped us to live healthier lives, but I bet there&#8217;s one thing you&#8217;ve never really thought about.&#8221;  And I said, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s that, Uncle Archer?&#8221;  &#8220;It also extends the lives of black people, of niggers.  They live longer too! So we got more of em. Bet you never thought of that!&#8221;  And I&#8217;m sitting there going, [laughing] &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re right, Uncle Archer, I never have!&#8221; I mean I was totally speechless. I mean, I just like&#8212;whewww! Wow. That, and I&#8217;m going to plug this in like a little sidebar, when I was in college &#8211; something that I didn&#8217;t mention &#8211; I had a course in Anthropology where the teacher taught us, what do you call it, the racist anthropology?  DC: Oh, yeah.  I know exactly what you&#8217;re talking about.  BM: It&#8217;s not eugenics, is it?  DC: Yes, eugenics.  BM: Yes, eugenics.  She taught us that by the skull shape, all that, how black people were genetically and physiologically inferior to white people.  DC: Right.  &#8220;Related to apes&#8221; and like that.  BM:  Yeah.  And so that was at one of my college courses.  But anyway, that was Bingham&#8217;s background.  Bingham was the only granddaughter on both sides of the family.  So here she was marrying this guy. Anyway.  So we come back to the South and we&#8217;re trying to figure out where to live. And we talk to people all over and there was a process to that.  And we decided to move into this neighborhood in 1972.  DC: Now did you have sort of a network, maybe from Union, of other Southerners doing the same kinds of things? No. You were on your own?  BM: We were on our own. And what had happened iss that we were going from town to town, city to city, Atlanta, or here, or somewhere in North Carolina. We were trying to figure out how to do this.  And we&#8217;d kind of decided that what we wanted to do was to associate ourselves with something already going on, rather than trying to create something.  And then use that, you know, stay there for a while until we kind of get the lay of the land.  That was what we had decided to do.  We looked at a Quaker school in North Carolina called Ceelow.  And then we had some people that we knew from Union that were in Greensboro.  We thought about that very seriously.  We knew some people in Atlanta, [but] didn&#8217;t want to live in Atlanta.  We weren&#8217;t going back to Alabama!  Knew people in Asheville[, North Carolina.]  And every place people would say, go see them, kind of thing.  Well then here, we came through here on our tour.  And people in Nashville had told us to meet Bill Troy and Jim [Sessions] and Fran [Ansley].  And we did.  And we talked with them and they told us what they were thinking about doing.  And it wasn&#8217;t what I was thinking about doing, because I was more interested in-- I mean, really, what I wanted to do long term, I wanted to work with low income white people. I mean, I had heard that enough: &#8220;Go! Deal with the white people, man!&#8221; So, all right. Go deal with the white people..  DC: Because that was the message you were getting at that time?  BM: By African Americans. There are still, why are you working in the black community?  Go deal with your people.  So I had this idea.  And I had done some thinking and some writing about utopian thought, and comparing that to the Kingdom of Heaven.  And sort of how true utopian thinking can, it is not just an isolated, idealized place but it actually shatters, comes back in and shatters the present. You know you imagine [it] and then it comes back in and shatters the present, or rearranges it.  And then that leads to new imaginations &#8211; that dialectic &#8211; it leads to new imaginations about, you dream about it, and it comes back and affects it.  And so I was thinking a lot in that time about people who lived in communes.  And I had friends who were in New York, they had a group called the People&#8217;s Church Commune and we partied them and knew them.  And some of them moved to Greensboro, so that was an idea, a possibility.  DC: Did they have a community in Greensboro?  BM: Well they were just in one house, there were like five or six people that came down there. That was a possibility, going and being a part of that. But Knoxville, see, this neighborhood was a poor white neighborhood and there was an old building down here that was being used, sort of used, as a neighborhood center.  Some of the churches, four of the churches around here, had hired a part-time worker to work with you down here.  DC: What was this neighborhood called.  BM: It wasn&#8217;t called anything then, but it&#8217;s called Fourth and Gill Neighborhood. So, we, after a lot of deliberation, decided to move to Knoxville and take a real leap of faith because we weren&#8217;t going to be affiliated with an organization, and we were just going to parachute into a neighborhood.  And we decided that what we would do is try to get part time jobs and work half-time at a job and work half-time doing the community stuff, community work, and trying to lead toward community organizing.  DC: Did you use that language? Or did you have a name for what it was you wanted to do? Did you say community organizing at that point?  BM: Yes, I guess I did use those terms.  What I was thinking about, the concept was, kind of, still the idea of building the Christian Community.  I was just having problems&#8212;I had studied this socialist colony down in Louisiana, I had written a paper about it, and I had done the original work on that.  I had done more than anyone else had ever done on that, maybe still, I don&#8217;t know.  A fantastic thing, there used to be six hundred and fifty people lived there and it lasted for twenty years and had twenty thousand acres.  It was a socialist colony.  Explicitly socialist.  DC: What was it called?  BM: Llano del Rio. L-l-a-n-o del Rio. Plains of the River. It started in California. I had done this work on that.  I was interested in this idea of the human community, the intentional community, and then the utopian community and all that.  But I really came to the conclusion that what we are really called to do, the real task, is building that community in existing communities.  Not like getting you and your buddies to go somewhere and groove on each other.  I mean that is &#8211; I mean it&#8217;s hard, it is hard &#8211; but  DC: It&#8217;s relatively easy!  BM: It&#8217;s relatively easy compared to parachuting in somewhere when you&#8217;re by yourself and trying to figure out to build community inside of what&#8217;s there.  And that&#8217;s what we did.  That was the work I did for ten years.  We did that.  I mean we were successful.  And I say we, because as soon as I started working, the &#8220;I&#8221; drops out of the picture.  It was a collective thing.  And we built a little collective of people that were people that, me, and this woman that was from Knoxville that was that youth worker that the churches had hired, Jamie Harris, you all have her name.    DC: Right, right.  So from the beginning?  BM: She and I were partners for ten years, work partners.  And we totally trusted each other and do to this day.  If I were to say something about something that happened and Jamie was to say, &#8220;Well, Bill, I remember that differently, then I would say, &#8220;then Jamie&#8217;s right.&#8221; I trust her as much as I trust myself, you know what I mean, especially about anything that happened.  We had an idea of trying to build&#8212;and Bingham was here for two years and then we split up.  She went to China, and then we split up.  But I worked here for ten years. We worked out of the neighborhood center building, the old building down there.  And we worked with people where they were at, which was poor white people.  And they were concerned about a park for the kids to play in.  We always did youth programs because it always came back to a concern for the kids. If you didn&#8217;t have a youth program then you&#8217;re S.O.L. [shit out of luck]. Because that was what we wanted to do anyway, but&#8212;It was a combination of organizing and explicitly being caring people about other people, building a social network, and taking care of each other.  There was a time for years that I thought, I&#8217;ve got he best insurance policy in the world, because if I was to lose my job, lose my health, you know, people would take me in and they would take care of me.  They would have two pieces of bread and I&#8217;d get one.  There&#8217;d be five people living in a two bedroom apartment and they would make room for me, that&#8217;s just the way it was. I mean, people were already doing that with each other, but we wrote about it, we reinforced it, we talked about it. We helped build it.  We propagated it.  We identified it.  We had a newspaper.  We started it in around 1975.  It&#8217;s a great newspaper.  DC: A neighborhood newspaper?  BM: Well, it started as a neighborhood newspaper and then it went inner-city-wide. And at one point we were printing like ten, twelve thousand copies.  DC: You&#8217;re kidding.  BM: Oh yeah, we got to the point, I&#8217;ll tell you what, we got to the point where basically our community organization was a subset of city government. City government didn&#8217;t do anything in this neighborhood without talking to us.  There wasn&#8217;t any sense in it.  For one thing, we were people of good intent.  We weren&#8217;t raising hell or causing trouble. [Phone rings] This is my wife. Hey babe.  [Break in recording]
-- [I don&#8217;t want to] romanticize it too much because there were many problems.  There were people peddling their own kids, there were kids losing consciousness from huffing paint, there were fights and domestic violence--I mean there was all that stuff.  But inside of all that there was this core group of people who were intentionally working together.  We met every Monday night for years--years!--and the meetings would go two or three hours.  The core group started out to be about like six or seven people and it never was probably more than ten, and we were the most feared community organization in East Tennessee, certainly in Knoxville, in Knox County.
DC: Right.
BM: Because we had smart people and dedicated people, fiercely dedicated people, fiercely believed in what we were doing, and we tried to do what was right, and we researched it, and the city government knew that we&#8217;d go tooth and toe nail, so they thought it would just be so much easier to cooperate with these people.
DC: [Laughs] Mm hmm.
BM: So whenever they wanted to do a zoning change or anything like that they&#8217;d call us and say, &#8220;We&#8217;re thinking about--.  What do you think about this?  Oh, well, okay, then we won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;
DC: Were you able to get powerful allies, whether funding or otherwise, on board at any point?
BM: We did coalition building a lot.  We started--.  The first coalition, which was an important one, was not one that we did; it was one that Urban League put together, and it was all black organizations and ours.  We joined together because--.  This was about 1975.  There was a community development act of 1974, which was the Housing and Community Development Act, the big CDBG block of grants, community development block grants, big chunks of money coming into cities to be used to deal with poverty.
DC: 1974.
BM: Mm hmm.  I think it&#8217;s called the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, if I&#8217;m not mistaken.  So the city decided they wanted to spend the CDBG money on renovating an old L&amp;N depot and a historic theater downtown.
DC: Okay.
BM: Oh, well that doesn&#8217;t sound exactly like what the regs said it had to be used for, so Urban League looked for people to sue the city and we joined in on that.
DC: What would they have used this for?
BM: It was supposed to be used for things like substandard housing.
DC: But they were going to make a--.
BM: They were going to renovate a historic--
DC: --cultural center, or something.
BM: --theater downtown and a historic train station with our money.
DC: Right.
BM: So we joined with Urban League and sued, so we went to meetings with Urban League and so this was like these poor white people in the room with these well educated black people, and us playing a supporting role but into it, and so our people are starting to get educated and understanding that to have power--.  We were a small neighborhood, you know, really we are, so to have power we needed to build alliances, so we did that.  We were constantly building alliances over things.
DC: Across race and class.
BM: Across race--not class, really.  It was all poor people.  We had a slogan which was, &#8220;Poor and working class people can have power by working together.&#8221;  That was on our newspaper, &#8220;Poor and working class people can have power by working together.&#8221;  And so sometimes we would go to churches and speak to try to raise money or some business people would say, &#8220;Well,&#8221;--in our newspaper, they&#8217;d say in our newspaper--&#8220;Well you&#8217;re just giving one point of view.&#8221;  We&#8217;d say, yeah, you&#8217;re right; we are.  We&#8217;re only giving one point of view, we&#8217;d say, like the News Sentinel and the Journal.  They give one point of view.  They give the business point of view, but they don&#8217;t say that.
DC: Right.
BM: We&#8217;re a voice of poor and working class people, and how do you possibly figure that out?  We say it right on the top of the page.  We&#8217;re not even trying to be the voice of anybody else. [Telephone rings]
DC: Right.
BM: You know?  I&#8217;m going to let that one go. [Referring to telephone] And so Jamie Harris was the editor of the newspaper.
DC: Okay, yeah.
BM: Then now the union connection comes in because one of the guys in the People&#8217;s Church Commune over in Greensboro, he moves over here, Mark Thompson.  He&#8217;s a hippie, a hippie plumber.
DC: And they were all union folks, or some of them.
BM: Well Mark Thompson came over here from Greensboro and they were union folks over there, a John Devries and Maggie Devries.
DC: I know John.
BM: Do you know John?
DC: Yeah.
BM: Where is he now?  John Devries, D-e-v-r-i-e-s.
DC: I didn&#8217;t know about the Greensboro thing.
BM: Where is he?
DC: Where is he now?  I have to think about it, because I did an interview with him.  Chicago?  He&#8217;s in Chicago now.  He&#8217;s had quite an interesting career in community development.
BM: Okay.  I think at one time he was running for city council over there, in Greensboro or something.  I don&#8217;t know.
DC: I don&#8217;t remember the Greensboro piece--
BM: We lost--.
DC: --but that&#8217;s--yeah.
BM: I don&#8217;t know if he and Maggie, if they split up or what, but they were--.  And then there was another couple, David somebody and Dawn Streeter, I think was her name.  Now they got into the RCP, or something, Revolutionary Communist Party, or something.  They got real heavy into the heavy ideological stuff.  I was recruited for some of that stuff but I never did do it.
DC: Well there&#8217;s the, yeah, Communist Worker&#8217;s Party folks in Greensboro later.
BM: Yeah, but there was another group out of Atlanta.  Who were they?  There was the RCP and who was the group--?  Anyway, I should remember but I don&#8217;t, because it&#8217;s just--.  I don&#8217;t know.  I don&#8217;t have a great memory either.
DC: I don&#8217;t either. [Laughs]
BM: So, it&#8217;s been thirty-something years.  A woman named Mary Joyce Johnson, the last I knew she was a lawyer with the [NORB].  She was an organizer with one of those groups and she would come through and we would spend a little time together.  Anyway--.
DC: The radical plumber comes. [Laughs]
BM: The radical plumber, Mark, comes and he moves in and he becomes a member of our group.  Then this guy, David Massey, he came from Georgia through--.  What did Rhodes College used to be?  Southwestern.
DC: Okay.

BM: In Memphis, and he came up with this group of crazy guys from Memphis.  They were just nuts.  They had a good time.  So Massey was up there my last year at Union.  He came in in &#8217;70, my last year, when I was all into the serious stuff.  Those guys were just cutting up.  So I met Massey and so then Massey goes later to Whitesburg, Kentucky and works on the Mountain Eagle there--that&#8217;s Jamie Harris&#8217; husband.
DC: Okay.
BM: Okay, so Massey comes down to visit us, right, and so then he meets Jamie and then he marries Jamie and then he moves into the neighborhood.
DC: Okay.
BM: So now we&#8217;re getting to your kind of idea of the union collective kind of thing.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: So now we&#8217;re on into the last half of the &#8217;70s, maybe.  I don&#8217;t know when Massey comes.  So now we&#8217;ve got this really great community organization that&#8217;s based on--.  It&#8217;s all about poor and working class people, and we&#8217;re taking on stuff.
DC: Now you mentioned that the initial idea was to get part time jobs--.
BM: Yeah, yeah, well I couldn&#8217;t--.
DC: How did that work out?
BM: Well I can tell you exactly how it worked out.  Bingham got a part time job; I tried to get a part time job.  The minimum wage at that time was a dollar and fifteen cents an hour, in 1972.  I think that&#8217;s right.  I went to work for Manpower because I couldn&#8217;t find anything for awhile, and I got a temp job in the summer unloading a freight car of lumber.  I worked eight hours at a dollar and fif--no, maybe it was a dollar thirty-five.  It might have been a dollar thirty-five.  I think it was a dollar thirty-five.  It could have been a dollar sixty-five.  It doesn&#8217;t really matter, but I worked all day for thirteen bucks.
DC: Right.
BM: Something like thirteen bucks, unloading a freight car of lumber in August, and I&#8217;m thinking this ain&#8217;t going to work.  Now we&#8217;re paying fifty dollars a month for rent and our utility bill was four dollars and eighty cents because they paid the heat.  We just paid the lights, so our rent and utilities was like--no it was sixty dollars.  It was less than sixty-five dollars.  That first year we--.  Well, what happened was, okay, there was a guy that had an organization he was putting together called Knoxville Urban Ministry.  He was a Methodist.  He was interested in urban ministry and so I met him, I think maybe through Troy and them.  I think they may have known him already.  He was Methodist, they&#8217;re Methodist.
DC: That sounds like something they would have been into, yeah.
BM: Yeah.  And so they were I think working out of the same building, so they may have hooked me up with Vaughn Nave, so Vaughn says--.
DC: I&#8217;ve heard that name.  Vaughn--?
BM: Nave, N-a-v-e.  Vaughn is from here.  He&#8217;s a Knoxville guy.  So Vaughn was trying to do this thing called Knoxville Urban Ministry and he wanted to include me in it, so he said, well let&#8217;s go talk to the district superintendent of the Methodist Church.  Guess what?  I&#8217;m not Methodist, right?  I&#8217;m not anything at this point.  I mean being an ex-Southern Baptist was just not the best thing to be.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: So anyway, we go see this guy and he says, tell me about yourself; where have you been; give me your credentials.  My credentials at that time, to be twenty-five, twenty-six years old, it was pretty impressive.  It was a pretty impressive list.  I&#8217;d done it all, right down to, you know, and so he said, &#8220;Well what do you want to do over there?&#8221; and I told him, and he said, &#8220;Well you know what?  To tell you the truth, the Church doesn&#8217;t know what to do in the inner cities, and what we really need is young people like you trying to figure it out.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;How much do you think it would take for you to be able to work full time?&#8221;  I said, &#8220;Well, I can do it for two hundred dollars a month.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get the two hundred dollars a month together for--,&#8221; I think it was like six months, &#8220;You go see what you can do over there.&#8221;  And that continued.
DC: Wow, yeah.
BM: So I worked full time for two hundred dollars a month.  Bingham was working for two hundred dollars a month, and we saved nine hundred dollars that first year.  So that&#8217;s where the support came from, was mostly from the Methodists and through Vaughn and then eventually I was paid three hundred dollars a month, four hundred dollars, you know what I mean.
DC: And the Knoxville Urban Ministry was a Methodist project, or was it ecumenical?
BM: Yeah, really I guess it all was.
DC: It really was, okay.
BM: I don&#8217;t know--.
DC: Was it ecumenical in spirit?
BM: It was supposed to be ecumenical but I think it was mostly--.  Yeah, it was ecumenical, because I think there was some Presbyterian money in there.
DC: Okay.
BM: So we were doing, I mean I had Vaughn&#8217;s support, and churches sometimes would raise questions because we were radical, but he would support us, and to his credit he stood up for us.  I was on the payroll of Knoxville Urban Ministry until I left here, until I left and went to work at legal aid.  But I&#8217;ll tell you a story or two.  We were into racial justice; we wrote articles; we were against police brutality.  What we would do is if somebody had a story we would say--.  Like I remember some guys were beaten up by the cops over in Mechanicsville, a couple of black guys.  One of them had just gotten out of the army or something.  So we just, instead of just going over there and just writing it down, or something like that, or even writing it and having them read it, we&#8217;d say, look, write the story; we&#8217;ll print it.  We&#8217;ll have to look at it, but our goal is to print it exactly like you write it, so you get your own voice.  You want your voice?  You want it printed in a paper where ten thousand people will get it?  This is your voice.  When we say a voice of poor American people we mean it.
DC: Yeah.
BM: We did labor support, and I mean we were explicit about it.  We weren&#8217;t like, well, it seems like they&#8217;re a little pro-union in this anti-union town.  Oh yeah?  Well guess what?  I mean we were just straight up and down about it.  Somebody was on strike, a bunch of Teamsters were on strike, people would say, eh, Teamsters, blah, blah, blah; we would go over there and meet with the guys on the picket line and we&#8217;d say, you want people to know your story?  Write the story.  Write it yourself and we will print it.
We would take on big issues, and in community organizing you never know how big it will get.  We took on community development because of the policies after that lawsuit.  We fought them because of their--.  They thought our neighborhood was too far gone to put community development block grant money into it.  They used a triage approach and they said, well, we&#8217;re not going to put money over there because we punched it in the computer and the computer told us you didn&#8217;t qualify.  It wasn&#8217;t us; we would love for you to get the money, but the computer--.
DC: You&#8217;re too poor, right.
BM: So we told them, we said, guess what?  That computer was made by a human being and the person who punched stuff in there was a human being.  We&#8217;re going to tell you what: Why don&#8217;t you just go over there and put something else in that computer and you make it tell you that it says our neighborhood is going to be a target area of a community development block grant or you&#8217;ll never hear the end of it.  And so we kept at it, and we kept at it for two or three years, and finally the mayor came out one day and we had a bunch of people gather around him and he said you&#8217;re going to be the next target area.  We went back and told his staff what he had said, and they said, oh, no, uh uh.  No, we&#8217;ve already chosen the target area.  And we said, I&#8217;m sorry; the mayor announced it in our neighborhood and we got it on tape, and we played it for them, so we were this target area, and we eventually got two or three million, or something.  That was a pretty big deal.
DC: So it sounds like the newspaper and that kind of ability to get the story out and apply pressure was an important part of what you guys did.
BM: It was, and there was a guy working for the city who would call us every now and then before the paper would come out and he would say, hey, are you guys writing anything about us in the paper?  Just curious; we&#8217;d just like to know in advance so we&#8217;re ready.
DC: Right.
BM: Isn&#8217;t that cool?
DC: Yeah.
BM: Oh, no, we haven&#8217;t got anything this time. You better call next month.
DC: [Laughs] We&#8217;re gunning for you, right.
BM: And we got to be friends with the city government.  It took us a while but we came to a common understanding, you know what I mean?  We had an understanding.  I was going to tell you about labor.  We had one issue of our newspaper that was just called &#8220;Labor in Knoxville,&#8221; or something, and it was all about labor support.  One of the more interesting stories was there was a meat processing plant right up here on Broadway--it&#8217;s gone now--called Huttenbauers, so we were approached by some guys working in it.  They&#8217;d been trying to get the union in there and the company had been fighting them tooth and toenail.  And the guy said working conditions in here are terrible, it&#8217;s really unsafe.  They said, &#8220;We got a guy, a friend of ours, who had his finger cut off in one of the machines.  And you know what?&#8221; they said.  &#8220;They didn&#8217;t even throw the meat away.&#8221;
DC: Ooh.
BM: Oh, okay.  Well you know what?  Let&#8217;s talk with some people about this and let&#8217;s write these statements down.  Let&#8217;s have you guys sign these, you know?  So we got these statements and we had people sign them and I wrote this article about Huttenbauer, about their efforts to get a union, about working conditions, and then what this guy&#8217;s statement said.  I quoted it.  That&#8217;s what he said, and other people said it happened too.  So then I call Huttenbauers.  I said, look, we&#8217;re going to write this article, but I tell you what, we&#8217;ll give you a chance to make a statement if you want to, and they said, oh, my gosh.  We sell this to Arby&#8217;s.  Oh, Arby&#8217;s?  Okay.  So I called Arby&#8217;s, the local Arby&#8217;s.  The local Arby&#8217;s said, we don&#8217;t buy from them.  So then I get a call from Arby&#8217;s headquarters from some vice president in charge of public relations, saying, look, you can&#8217;t write that article, it&#8217;s just a few people&#8217;s opinion, blah, blah, blah.  I said, the article is already written and we&#8217;ve got signed statements from these guys.  They flew a woman in here at the Hyatt Regency to negotiate with me about the article and I took June Rostin--I don&#8217;t know--?
DC: Uh huh.
BM: I mean she should be on y&#8217;all&#8217;s list.
DC: Yeah, she is.
BM: I think June went with me because I wasn&#8217;t going by myself.
DC: Well you need a witness. [Laughs]
BM: Oh, yeah, who knows, and so we hemmed and hawed around, and finally I told them, I said, well, we&#8217;ll print whatever you want to say.  I said here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d suggest: I would suggest that you say something like, &#8220;We abhor bad working conditions where anybody could be injured.  We will insist that any place that we are doing business with have safe working conditions and treat their workers fairly, and if they want to join a union that is their right.&#8221;  [They said,] &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll work on it,&#8221; and they worked on it, and then they finally gave me this statement, which was a little watered down, but it wasn&#8217;t bad.  We printed the whole thing.  They got the union.
DC: Wow, so alongside of everything else, the story and the statement.
BM: Yeah.  So I mean I think our people were--we had a good group of people, and people weren&#8217;t afraid and they were clearly dedicated to trying to work for the--.  Our slogan was, as I said, a voice--.  The paper was a voice of poor and working people, but then we had another slogan which was, &#8220;Poor and working class people can have power by working together,&#8221; and so then we shortened it later to just say, &#8220;People have power by working together,&#8221; or something like that.  Oh, no, and then later for a little slogan we put, &#8220;Together we are strong.&#8221;
DC: Together we are strong.
BM: Together we are strong.  That&#8217;s on the neighborhood center now, &#8220;Together we are strong.&#8221;
DC: Okay.  So the neighborhood center still exists?
BM: The building is there.  It&#8217;s kind of run down.  It&#8217;s being rented by like a group of artists and stuff.  The neighborhood organization doesn&#8217;t run any programs out of there now.  So anyway, we did that and then I left there and started working for legal aid.  Well while I was at Fourth and Gill we did a coalition--oh, Jesus!--we did a coalition called Inner City Neighborhood Coalition.
DC: So did your organization have a name, or was there an organization?
BM: Yeah, it was Fourth and Gill Neighborhood Organization.
DC: Fourth and Gill Neighborhood Organization, okay.
BM: Everybody knew Fourth and Gill Neighborhood Organization because, like I said, it was the strongest community organization in the city, and people respected that, black community, white community, everywhere, city government; they respected that organization, so we built a coalition.
DC: And the coalition again was called--?
BM: It was called Inner City Neighborhood Coalition, so we had named the neighborhood Fourth and Gill and then we named this area of the city the Inner City because that term was not being used, so we called it the Inner City Neighborhood Coalition, and then we started working together with a coalition of groups.  I was the president of that, chair of it, whatever, so, after time we decided we were going to work on tenant rights, so we built a relationship with the legal clinic at UT.  They would handle the cases and we would do the organizing, tried to.  So the CAP agency, the [C-A-P], CAP agency, community action agency, federally funded group, when Carter was in the White House they developed this plan.  Actually Joe Kennedy developed it, Joseph Kennedy, Robert Kennedy&#8217;s son, this idea that under the CAP agency--.  CAP agencies used to do organizing but they strayed to where they were basically an arm of the government.  They wanted to try to encourage the CAP agencies to get back into organizing, and the way to do that, they thought, was to get the CAP agency to link with a community organization, have them do a joint project and proposal, and then the feds would fund it.  So that offer was made to us that the Inner City Neighborhood Coalition would work with the CAP agency here and we would do this project.  So I met with their staff and we talked it over and we decided to do tenant organizing.  Well we get underway and we start working on this proposal and people in Washington say sounds like a great idea.  Then all of a sudden the guy I&#8217;m dealing with, who&#8217;s like a regional town--he&#8217;s from a district in Knoxville, one of the neighborhood centers--I&#8217;m not dealing with him anymore.  I&#8217;m dealing with the director and the assistant director and they&#8217;ve got lots of questions, lots of questions, in fact that&#8217;s all they&#8217;ve got, is questions, no answers.  They&#8217;re very smart, especially the assistant director.  She&#8217;s the director now, and they were very smart people, very politically savvy and very politically hooked up, wired.  They were not about to let this thing happen because they were dealing with the tenant council, they were dealing with the housing authority, the housing authority had power, and so they started opposing it in different ways.  Finally the people in Washington got tired of dealing with them.  Actually Joe Kennedy came here and sat down with us and said, &#8220;Are you guys going to play ball or not?&#8221; and they said, oh, yeah, yeah.  We&#8217;ll be good.  Then Joe Kennedy said, &#8220;Okay, good.  We want to see some product in two weeks.&#8221;  Well they dragged their feet so Joe Kennedy told his people, cut them off and just get the proposal from the Inner City Neighborhood Coalition.  So we sent in--.  Well I flew to Washington and I worked on the proposal with them and they liked it.  Of course they helped write it.  So all of a sudden I get a call from Washington and they said, &#8220;We got problems with this proposal because the Congressman has opposed it.&#8221;  Seventy-five thousand dollar proposal and the Republican Congressman opposes it.  Why?  Why is he wasting his time?
DC: Exactly.
BM: They said, &#8220;That&#8217;s a problem.  Can you do anything?&#8221;  We said, well, we&#8217;ll work on it.  So we contacted Senator Sasser&#8217;s office, a Democrat, so Helen Jacobs called me and said, &#8220;Hey, Bill, guess what?  Things are looking good.  We got a call from Senator Sasser&#8217;s office and he kind of trumps the Congressman.&#8221;  I&#8217;ve never seen anything like this before, getting a Congressman and then a Senator involved in some little tenant organizing proposal for seventy-five thousand dollars, so looks like it&#8217;s going to work.  Then she calls me back and she says, &#8220;Wait just a minute.  We got a problem.  You&#8217;re not going to believe it.  We got a call from Senator Baker&#8217;s office, and even though he&#8217;s a Republican he&#8217;s the Senate Minority Leader, and President Carter has to deal with him all the time and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything we can do about this.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just floored this proposal has reached to the level of the Senate Minority Leader, but unless you all can figure something out I think it&#8217;s dead.&#8221;  So I&#8217;m thinking, God, who&#8217;s more important than a Senate Minority Leader?  Well there&#8217;s my second cousin, her husband, Jimmy Carter.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: You know, I&#8217;m glad Mama&#8217;s first cousin is Rosalynn&#8217;s mother, so maybe when I&#8217;m down in Plains staying with my uncle I can walk across the street and talk to Miss Allie.  So I&#8217;m down staying with my uncle and I walk across the street and knock on the door and say, &#8220;Miss Allie, I&#8217;m Cat Wise&#8217;s boy,&#8221; and she&#8217;s in her bathrobe.  &#8220;Come on in here!  How is Cat?&#8221; you know.  So I tell her what&#8217;s going on and I also tell her that my aunt had given me the family photograph of mine and Rosalynn&#8217;s common great grandparents, which is hanging upstairs.  I have the family photograph.
DC: You have the copy of it, yeah.
BM: My grandmother gave it to me.  So I said I&#8217;d like to give Rosalynn a copy of it and also I&#8217;d like to talk to her about this, you know, write her about this project.  It&#8217;s just amazing what&#8217;s happened.  So anyway, Miss Allie said, &#8220;Well, Bill, if you send that to Washington she&#8217;ll never see it.&#8221;  But, she said, &#8220;You send it to me and I&#8217;ll put it in a special envelope and I&#8217;ll put a little number on it, a special number, and when she see it&#8217;s from Mama, I&#8217;m not promising that she&#8217;ll do something about your project, I&#8217;m just promising you she&#8217;ll read it.&#8221;
DC: Right.
BM: So I said, okay, so I made a print of the photo, sent it to Miss Allie; didn&#8217;t hear a thing, didn&#8217;t hear a thing, didn&#8217;t hear a thing.  I don&#8217;t even think I told the people in Washington.  A couple months later this woman, Helen Jacobs, called me.  She said, &#8220;We got a phone call from the Congressman against it.  We got a phone call from the junior Senator for it.  We got a phone call from the Senate Minority Leader against it.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to believe this.  We just got a phone call from the White House.&#8221;
DC: For your seventy-five thousand dollar grant, right.
BM: She said, &#8220;The check&#8217;s in the mail.&#8221;  So we did tenant organizing.  Mark Thompson--from Union, right?  He didn&#8217;t finish but he&#8217;s the one who came over.  He was the director of the tenant self-help project, so by now we&#8217;re in the late &#8217;70s and Mark is head of the tenant self-help project and David Massey is working with Jamie on the newspaper, so I&#8217;m giving you this union kind of connection.
DC: Got it, yeah.
BM: And so Mark--and I&#8217;m still chair of the Inner City Neighborhood Coalition and all that stuff.  We&#8217;ve got a staff of like five or something.  I don&#8217;t know how many people we&#8217;ve got working because they were this, this, and all this stuff, and we formed tenant organizations in every public housing development.  And then we got a promise that these HUD officials that were supposed to come and meet with us, and they wouldn&#8217;t come and all this, so a bunch of tenants went and had a sit-in at the HUD office and shut the HUD office down and said we&#8217;re not leaving until we get a promise from the HUD officials that they&#8217;re coming and having a hearing with us.  So finally they were able to get a hold of them and they promised and it was set up and then a big meeting with like two or three hundred people [and all the issues popping out].  So anyway, it&#8217;s a neat story.
DC: Yeah, amazing.  And then when did you start working with legal aid?
BM: Worked with legal aid in &#8217;82, so I&#8217;ve been there for twenty-eight years.
DC: And that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re doing still?
BM: Yeah, I work part time now.  And then I worked with grassroots groups and I worked with--.  I did kind of like a little coalition called Solutions, and that&#8217;s floundering now but it started in about &#8217;82 or &#8217;83.  It was a poor people&#8217;s voice, basically poor people.
DC: Out of legal aid, or is this separate?
BM: Well I was doing my job at legal aid and so legal aid had wanted to do more work with community organizations and they were working for somebody that knew how to do that, so that&#8217;s what I know how to do so they hired me.
DC: So what were your specific job duties?
BM: Well the idea was they wanted--.  They were dealing with individual cases so they&#8217;d have a case of one person who couldn&#8217;t get service at a hospital and another person who couldn&#8217;t get service at a hospital and another person who couldn&#8217;t, but they had no way to do anything other than represent individuals, so they wanted somebody who&#8217;d worked with people as a group and helped them to be self advocates.
DC: To form coalitions, yeah.
BM: So I did that.
DC: That&#8217;s really interesting.
BM: But they weren&#8217;t sure exactly how to do it.  They were lawyers but they said well we don&#8217;t really--.  Here&#8217;s the idea.  There&#8217;s this indigent healthcare program, four million dollar program that the county has, and they have ended it, but they have the legal right to have it or end it.  There&#8217;s no requirement on them that they have it.  They said we need somebody who can figure this out.  I said, well, I know how to do that.
DC: Bring some pressure, right.
BM: Yeah.  So I pulled groups together and pulled the first meetings together and I just said [to] ten people, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening.  Y&#8217;all all know this.  Do you want together on it?  Yeah, heck, let&#8217;s do, you know, so these groups come together and build this coalition and they gave themselves a name and they started dealing with the county and dealing with the hospitals and holding their own hearings, and if people wouldn&#8217;t show up they&#8217;d put a jacket on the chair and dress it,--
DC: [Laughs]
BM: --and finally they figured--.  It took a while for us to figure out that it was one of the hospitals that was holding the program up.
DC: The whole thing up, yeah.
BM: The county was now willing, or will continue it, if we&#8217;re dealing with a group of hospitals, and there&#8217;s one hospital holding it up.  We forced it out of one of the county commissioners as to which hospital it was, because we found out there was one but we didn&#8217;t know which one it was, so then we find out, so then we&#8217;re meeting over in Mechanicsville at this woman&#8217;s house trying to figure out how to deal with this.  We decide what we&#8217;re going to do is write them a letter, and I know I have that letter somewhere.  It was such a great letter.  It explained the issue, explained now what we knew.  I mean we knew it was them, right?  And we said--this phrase I remember--&#8220;And we would like to have you come to a community meeting to discuss this matter.&#8221;  And then it said, &#8220;However, if you&#8217;re not able to attend our community meeting, meeting with you is of such importance that we&#8217;ll be glad to have our meeting at your hospital.&#8221;
DC: [Laughs] Right.
BM: [Laughs] So this is the Southern way of doing it, right?
DC: Yes.  I got it.  I see it, yeah.
BM: And so delivered it--this is true.  This was like a Wednesday, as I recall--this was in 1983--delivered the letter that day.  The morning newspaper the next morning said, &#8220;Last evening hospitals in Knoxville finally reached agreement with the county to reinitiate the four million dollar indigent healthcare plan.&#8221; [Laughs]
DC: That&#8217;s great, yeah.
BM: &#8220;Meeting with you is of such importance--.&#8221;  I&#8217;ll never forget that.
DC: We will be at your front door, right.
BM: So that group did some, you know, it was all about issues and so it&#8217;s a little harder when you&#8217;re just an issue organization because you&#8217;ve got to have the next issue coming, and we got hooked up with National People&#8217;s Action out of Chicago, Shel Trapp and those people, National Training and Information Center.  We went to some of their stuff and some of their annual things.  That was really the only national connection we had.  And we did organizing over telephone rates, and tax reform, and the city wanting to close fire halls, and rerouting hazardous waste trucks around the inner city.  It was a real good group.  It was a very tough group and we had an excellent leader, an African American woman who was totally fearless.
DC: This is legal aid that you&#8217;re talking about?
BM: I mean the coalition.
DC: The coalition, because it&#8217;s still--
BM: I was basically--.
DC: --a part of that work?
BM: I was basically their staff person.
DC: Okay, yeah.
BM: I mean that&#8217;s what it was.  That was mostly what I was doing, was working with this coalition of groups, and legal aid was happy about it because we were dealing with poor people&#8217;s issues, and besides by that point they were probably afraid to mess with it, you know what I mean?
DC: [Laughs]
BM: I mean it was working.  They wanted people to be advocates for themselves and we were doing it.
DC: You did it, yeah.
BM: I mean we were taking on prenatal care for women on Medicaid.
DC: It wasn&#8217;t a single issue.  It went on to other things.
BM: No, we just kept--we had eight or ten of them.  So then finally after like two or three years I wrote a grant to get enough money to hire their own organizer and helped them incorporate so they were independent of legal aid.  So then they hired their organizer, so I&#8217;m basically just helping, and then he and I write grants and they hire a couple more organizers.
DC: What&#8217;s the name of the coalition?
BM: It was called--.  Right now the name that it&#8217;s become known as is Solutions.
DC: Okay.
BM: It started out as Solutions to Indigent Care in Knoxville, SICK, then it changed to Solutions to Issues of Concern to Knoxville, and it continued to be called SICK.  Then after years people said, let&#8217;s make it sound nicer; let&#8217;s just call it Solutions.
A; Okay, got it.
BM: So that was a multi-issue--.  Probably--.
DC: That&#8217;s really interesting how it adapted.
BM: Yeah, and that&#8217;s hard because you&#8217;ve got to be scoping out the next issue and you got to do social networking too, but if you&#8217;re just an issue group that&#8217;s hard because you&#8217;ve got to have the new issue coming in, you know what I mean?
DC: Right.
BM: But you also can&#8217;t be splitting your power.
DC: Right.
BM: It was the strongest voice for black people and poor people&#8217;s issues.  It was not just a black organization, it was probably about half and half, but probably most of the time the most visible leadership was African American and this one woman, she was street smart, savvy, and she and I had the kind of working relationship where most of the time we completely trusted each other.  She would be asked to do something, like speak at a hearing or something.  The first thing she&#8217;d do would be call me and we would get our heads together and figure out the right strategy to use, and of course then I&#8217;m sitting in the back of the room but she knows I&#8217;m there for her.  She knows I would die for her, do whatever.  My job is to help her to be successful, and she knew that.  I was clear about that.  She was clear about that.  And so we were a good team.  It was a whole group but I really felt like she and I most of the time were a real good team.  We respected each other&#8217;s abilities.  She would take it to the jaws of the monster, man.  I remember one time we were over there in her office and the phone rang and she picks it up, and I laugh and I said before she answered it, I said, &#8220;Hey, tell the governor I said hello.&#8221;  She talked a little while and then she hung up and she said, &#8220;That was the governor.  He was calling from the airport.&#8221;
DC: Right. [Laughs] That&#8217;s great.
BM: So it was an organization that people in Nashville knew, that around the state people knew.  It was probably the strongest community organization in the state.
DC: Is she still around?
BM: No, she died.  She died.
DC: She passed away.
BM: She was just--I just had such respect for her.
DC: What was her name?
BM: Nettie Ballinger, N-e-t-t--.  Nettie Sue Ballinger.  Yeah, that was a real loss.  She had some of the--.  I mean she had the street smarts which took her sometimes, you know, in kind of a hustle direction every now and then but mostly she was a fighter and fearless and smart about it.
So after that work I got more into working on--.  They had their own staff and everything and I did less with that, got more into coalition building around reinvestment stuff, Community Reinvestment Act stuff.  Then we did some coalition building on fighting the banks, and that was a real exciting effort because we built a thing we called the East Tennessee Community Reinvestment Coalition, [C-R-C], community reinvestment coalitions, and so we decided we were going to take on the banks.  So we were like, okay, how do you fight banks?
DC: Right.
BM: Well we had some assistance both from--well mostly out of National Training Information Center in Chicago, you know, in CRA and training how to deal with CRA and looking at Home Mortgage Disclosure Act information, research.  We had a guy who was real good on research.  Our core group was about half black and half white but really the main core group was--I mean the main movers were three of us white guys from Fourth and Gill, and sometimes people kind of called us the three white guys from Fourth and Gill.
DC: [Laughs]
BM: Because we were.
DC: [Laughs] Right.
BM: But our steering committee was about half black and half white and we worked to be as accountable to everybody as much as we could.  Taking on the banks was a whole other level of work, and we were trying to figure out how to do it, so what we decided was our strategy was to go after one bank.  Try to find the worst bank and go after them and then talk to the other banks on the sly, basically say, this could be you, you know?
DC: Right.
BM: So we went after First Tennessee Bank, which was the biggest and had the worst record, and we went after them with a rusty meat ax, I mean just went after them and went after them.  Well the newspaper was on our side and I think for one year we had like sixty-something articles in the newspaper.  Basically they would print whatever we asked them to.  If it was good stuff and we had something to say they would print it.  First Tennessee just dug in and dug in and fought back and looked like assholes, to the public, and so anyway it took I forgot how long but one of the other banks said let&#8217;s make a deal, and they came up and announced this twenty-million dollar reinvestment program for the inner city.
DC: They saw a way to look good by comparison.
BM: Oh, yeah.  The other banks were furious with them, but by then it was too--I mean they&#8217;d [broke and run].
DC: Right.
BM: So we praised them for this stuff.  It wasn&#8217;t that good a program, but you know.  So then there was a creative guy in city government and he said, hey, hey, wait.  Let&#8217;s all see if we can identify our common goal.  The city&#8217;s interested in reinvesting in the neighborhoods, the banks have a legal requirement, the neighborhoods want it; let&#8217;s see if we can identify what we have in common.  So we built a partnership and part of that became the Knox Housing Partnership and it still exists.  It came out of that.  There were other kind of partnership efforts.  We had a microloan program for awhile and a Center for Neighborhood Development for awhile.  Both of those are gone.  Well, the microloan program still exists a little bit at Urban League.
DC: Did you ever consider yourself, or people from the community, running for political office?
BM: For office?  People asked me that over the years fairly often and I&#8217;ve always pretty much answered the same way, and that is that my nightmare is the phone ringing in the middle of the night and answering it and somebody saying, &#8220;Bill Murrah, this is Ms. Johnson, and I&#8217;ve got a bunch of dogs running loose in my backyard and I want you to do something about it.&#8221;
DC: [Laughs]
BM: And that&#8217;s my answer to that question.
DC: Right.
BM: You know if I were I would do something like city council or something.  There was one guy I remember one time he [kept saying], &#8220;You need to run for mayor.&#8221;  I&#8217;m just not interested, at all, not at all.  I like being able to speak with more of a clear voice.  When you get in that arena you got to build alliances with all these ultra conservative whatever and then you&#8217;ve got to stay in relationship with them and in the same room with them.  Anyway, that&#8217;s too much like the Baptist Church.
DC: [Laughs] So you found another way to operate.
BM: So after the reinvestment stuff, and I worked on into the &#8217;90s with some of that reinvestment stuff, trying to make that happen, trying to work with the bankers and the city and other neighborhoods trying to make that [happen.]  And then late &#8217;90s and early 2000s and all I worked on putting together a coalition of community organizations from all over East Tennessee, and that&#8217;s the Community Economic Development Network of East Tennessee, and that&#8217;s the one that has three task forces, African American and Latino and our rural task force.
DC: Community Economic Development--
BM: Network--
DC: --Network.
BM: --of East Tennessee.  That&#8217;s a real good group.  It&#8217;s multiracial and works on issues related to those three constituencies, and I&#8217;ve been working with them for about ten years, a little more, putting it together and raising money for it.
DC: What are the communities that you all cover?
BM: The ones that are most active reach from Maryville, Blount County, Knoxville, and then up to really about Greenville, Tennessee.  We pull a little bit from Johnson City every now and then, on up in the upper east end, Cocke County, Newport, Morristown, Jefferson City, Jefferson County, Sevier County, and people come from those counties.  They come.  We have quarterly meetings of the main group and then each task force has meetings.  The African American, they call themselves, as I mentioned earlier, the African American Heritage Alliance.  There are people active in that from probably about six or seven counties.  Their plan now is to work with East Tennessee Historical Society and have, in 2011, an East Tennessee African American heritage conference and celebration.    DC: Oh, good.  BM: I mean it&#8217;s like, guess what, they&#8217;re black people.  They&#8217;ve done great things and we want to tell you about it, and let&#8217;s party meanwhile.
DC: Right, [Laughs] the best way to do it.
BM: Then use that as a stepping stone to 2013 to have the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of recognition of the 8th of August, when Andrew Johnson freed his slaves.
DC: So that&#8217;s the hundred and fiftieth, okay.
BM: 1863.  And then the Latino group, they&#8217;ve done some significant things.  They dealt with banks back around 2000 and all over trying to get them to change their practices toward Latinos and allow Latinos to open accounts without social security numbers and hire Latinos and stuff.  SunTrust Bank did that hook line and sinker, adopted everything that we proposed.  We had five proposals and they said, sure, we&#8217;ll do them all.
DC: Really?  Great.
BM: And then we went from that to helping form a Hispanic chamber of commerce.  It exists now; it&#8217;s running.  Then we&#8217;ve been working on a--.  We did a bilingual legal manual, English/Spanish, sort of basic legal rights, and then we&#8217;ve been working more in the last year or so trying to establish a Hispanic center Centro Hispano..
DC: Where is your Hispanic population from for the most part?
BM: Mostly Mexicans.  I don&#8217;t know.  I&#8217;d bet it&#8217;s eighty percent Mexican.
DC: Okay.
BM: But the leaders are from all over the place, Venezuela, Bolivia, Columbia, Mexico, Puerto Rico especially.  So anyway, that&#8217;s a lot of talking.
DC: I know, and we could--.  Well, we might do another one at some point.
BM: I don&#8217;t know if this gets at what you were interested in.
DC: It does, it does.  It may not feel like it but it does. [Laughs]  And Jessie and you will be in touch, I think to talk more specifically about African American women.
BM: The Union connection has gotten nonexistent, so.
DC: Right, and that&#8217;s just my interest, getting that part of your background.  It&#8217;s more this community organizing piece that I wanted to get on tape.  But Jessie will be in touch with you about the women&#8217;s piece, I think.
BM: Yeah.
DC: Well thank you very much.
BM: Well and thank you.
DC: It&#8217;s really been a pleasure.
BM: I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever told all that in one--phew!--
DC: Right. [Laughs]
BM: --&#8220;swell foop,&#8221; you know.
