Speaker 1: We're going to move on and the early part of the interview will deal with your family background and I'd like to start with your mother.  Would you tell me her name and tell me a little bit about your mother.
Speaker 2: Her name is Maggie [Nichols Comer].  I wrote a book about her called 'Maggie's American Dream[: The Life and Times of a Black Family,' James P. Comer, M.D.] which describes her part, along with my dad [Hugh Comer], in helping the five children gain thirteen college degrees despite the fact that my mother was born into extreme poverty, her family.  Her father [Jim Nichols] was a good man in rural Mississippi, a sharecropper, and he really cared about his family but he was killed by lightening when she was six years of age.  And because of--the children were small and there were no programs to help families and they couldn't work the farm, and as a result of that, a cruel stepfather came into their lives and he was a very abusive man in every way and he would not allow the children to go to school.  But my mother decided when she was about eight years of age that the way to a better life was through education and when she was sixteen, she ran away to a sister in East Chicago, Indiana and, hoping to go to school, but the sister did not think there was any future for colored girls in getting an education, it wouldn't support it, and she had to drop out of school, but when my mother dropped out, she declared that if she ever had children, she was going to make certain that all of her children got a good education.  And then she and my dad, together, made it possible for us to.
Speaker 1: Okay, where was she born, did we--
Speaker 2: She was born in Woodland, Mississippi.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what year?  Do you recall her birth?
Speaker 2: In 1904.
Speaker 1: Nineteen oh four [1904], okay.  What do you know, in addition to what you've just shared with me about her growing up years, as a child, as a early teenager, what do you know about her growing up years?
Speaker 2: Well she said all together, she probably had two years of school but not sequential.  She, from time to time, they would go to school.  She said all of that would amount to about two years.  They moved from place to place.  The father was kind of a ne'er-do-well, stepfather was a ne'er-do-well.  He would run off from the family.  He had other families across town.  He would come back and was totally unpredictable and they lived under just horrible circumstances but the mother [Maude Nichols] was a warm type who got to know people wherever, and they kind of lived off the land and the people.  The people would help them out because the storekeepers would give them food that they were going to throw out they couldn't keep, they would give them food.  People she worked for would help them out and they kind of lived off the charity of other people all the time because he never really provided a living.  He was there sometimes and when he was there he provided a living but most of the times he didn't.  But the children, she and her brothers [Leroy and Nichols] and sisters [Carrie Watkins and Susie Cossey] had a warm, supportive relationship and she was kind of a leader of the group, although she wasn't the oldest and they, they had a good relationship and helped each other but, you know, she was a--not a privileged experience.
Speaker 1: Okay--
Story_ID: 210150
Speaker 1: Are there any special stories that you remember at this point in time that your mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] told you about her experiences or about her ancestors?  Any special stories that came from her that talked about past generations of your family?
Speaker 2: Eh, not, not really.  She really didn't know past generations of the family.  She knew that once her father [Jim Nichols] died, the, his two or three children in the family, their parents came and got them and took them away.  She knew that she had a, an aunt who was possibly Indian [Native American] and that she had long hair that she could sit on.  She knew some of the white families that lived around who were helpful to her and the family and that was where she first got an impression that there was a better way to live and she went into their homes and they were kind to her and she decided that there was something else.  And there was also two black school teachers who lived around the corner from her and I think she decided that she wanted to be like them and she wanted to be the opposite of her stepfather and I think that's where her desire to be successful grew out of those relationships.  Also, her father loved her and she described him, picking her up and calling her "Doll" and he loved her so much.  She recalled that and I think those factors made her feel that she was somebody of worth.  She identified with people who cared about her and she made a negative identification with her stepfather, the opposite of whatever he was, that's what she wanted to be.
Story_ID: 210151
Speaker 1: Tell me about her [Comer's mother, Maggie Nichols Comer] personality.  What was she like as a person and when you were growing--when you were a child?  What was she like as a person--what was her personality like?
Speaker 2: Well, she was outgoing but a part of it shy and you never, I never knew that really and I never realized that she had any fear of anything because she would take anybody on if they were wrong but she was always pleasant and caring and supportive but she was also funny and she was tough and in the right situation, but she didn't, she wasn't tough in an aggressive kind of way.  You just didn't walk over her and whenever she had to confront people in school or wherever, she did it by marshalling the facts and presenting the case and challenging their arguments but never raising her voice, just the facts, and just funny, you know, and she said things like, if you did something stupid that, like teenagers or young children would do, she said on one occasion, "Use your head for something besides a hat rack," and so, you know, this vision in my mind of, my head, as the hat rack and nothing else in it.  But she was, she could be tough but warm and caring.  One--I remember that every Sunday evening, the four younger children, I had an older sister [Louise Comer] who's my father's [Hugh Comer] child, the four younger children, every Sunday evening she'd gather us around and read us the funny papers.  Funny papers weren't great literature and she had second grade reading level and, but that wasn't what was important.  What was important was being close to her and every, each one of us had a favorite column that we wanted her to read again and again till she had read the paper, two, three times.  And what was important about that was the closeness, the warmth, the kind of nurturance that we received from that and at the same time, you had a positive, emotional charge from reading and inquiry and we loved it but there were, many experiences like that with my mom and dad.  They would take us out to the, to the lakefront and let us play while they'd sit and talk or they would play with us and interact with us from time to time.  We had popcorn, warm popcorn on summer evenings on the porch.  Malted milk popsicles, all of that she made and it was cheaper, it was better and it was more personal and we had great times together as a family.  We would always eat at the same time so that there was regularity.  We had discussions about everything that went on during the day, went on in school.  You understood that you were expected to speak and report but you were also expected to listen to the others.  You couldn't talk too long.  All the rules of conversation were learned in that experience.
Story_ID: 210152
Speaker 1: Tell me about your father.  What was his name?
Speaker 2: It was Hugh Comer and he was from Comer, Alabama, which is the name of the slave master and there was a huge plantation [in Barbour County, Alabama] and they were the, lived on that plantation as slaves, as freed people.  They bought, were buying, the plant--part of the plantation when the boll weevil struck and that's what caused my father to leave and go to East Chicago [Indiana] to find work in the steel mills, trying to save the farm, and that was my father.  He was the reliable, tough guy who's also very easygoing and very warm but he, he was from the old tradition.  My mother [Maggie Nichols Comer], my mother ran the family and the kids raised the kids, although my father provided and was absolutely reliable.  Every day he got off from work, we knew that we would expect him at a certain time of day, would come around, Gargas Coal Company, was down the street from us, and we'd all go running, the four of us, to jump up in his arms.  He's a very important person in our lives--
Speaker 1: His birth year was what?
Speaker 2: Nineteen, 1892, I believe.
Speaker 1: Eighteen ninety-two [1892].
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Is that right?  My mother, '04 [1904], that's, he was twelve years older.
Speaker 1: Uh-hm.
Speaker 2: That's right.
Story_ID: 210153
Speaker 1: Now, who was your [paternal] ancestor who was enslaved then, on the Comer plantation [Comer, Barbour County, Alabama]?
Speaker 2: I don't, it was my great-grandfather.  That's as far back as I know anything about him, and then my grandfather, I didn't, I didn't know him at all.  He died before I was born.  My father [Hugh Comer] and his brothers and sisters, I knew some of them and, but I know that my father's, my grandfather was a minister and they were from a poor, but well-functioning family and they were, my father had maybe sixth, seventh-grade education at an academy, Alabama rural, but, you know, he was a very, both of my parents were very religious people--
Story_ID: 210154
Speaker 1: He [Comer's father, Hugh Comer] was religious but he was very practical, determined, education-oriented, wanted to get ahead and yet he was easygoing, but a tough guy.  One of the favorite stories we remember and my, this is the--
Speaker 2: I was just going to ask you about stories that he told you.
Speaker 1: Well the culture of our family was, you know, be nice but don't let anybody walk over you and both of my parents expressed that in their relationship with everybody.  They were nice people but they were tough people and I remember the story I heard in the family was about the time after my father became very ill, he was a steel mill laborer and they had him as the head of the janitors gang just so he could be there because he couldn't, he couldn't do much anymore, and a tough kid out of Chicago [Illinois] thought he'd take on the old man.  Well, they had to pull the old man off the kid because he was, he was tough, even sick he was tough, but he was a nice guy, would never bother anybody.  He tried to get, this kid tried to get my dad fired and the union people laughed at him because Hugh Comer would never start a fight with anybody but was a tough guy--
Story_ID: 210155
Speaker 1: You told us a little bit about his [Comer's father, Hugh Comer] personality, what he was like, but say a bit more about his personality.
Speaker 2: Well, you know, I, my dad had to leave when, he left the steel mills when I was ten years of age because he had a disease related to the dust that he--so it was, related to his job, and lived in Arizona for the last ten years of his life and died before, when I was twenty.  So, I didn't get to know him the same way I know my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer], and I never got to interview him in the same way that I interviewed my mother but I remember him as a deeply caring person who wanted us to be very successful.  Remember, my middle name is Pierpont that was Pierpont after [John] Pierpont [J.P.] Morgan who they believed to be the richest man in America, at the time, certainly one of the most powerful.  They believed in the American dream.  They believed in striving and so that's what that naming was really all about.  The, the, he was highly respected in church.  When we walked down the street with my dad, the thugs tipped their hats to my dad because my dad was the kind of guy who respected everybody, they knew he was tough, he was charitable, he gave to people who were poor, who had less than us, and we didn't have a lot.  He was churchgoing, law-abiding.  He was there on time.  He was the head of the Sunday school, the head of the Baptist Young People's [Union (BYPU)] Training [sic. Union] Unit.  When people see him going, they would start running because they know it was time, he was very conscious of time.  He, when I was rejected from the Boy Scouts [of America], or Cub Scouts or something, when I was a kid, my dad went with me to the Boy Scouts and he, I remember him standing outside talking to the leader a long time, and then finally the next day, the next week or so, he got a person in our church to establish a Boy Scouts because there was a national rule that wouldn't allow the scouts to integrate.  So my dad made sure that we had that kind of experience.
Speaker 1: The name of the church that--
Speaker 2: It was Zion Baptist Church [Zion Missionary Baptist Church, East Chicago, Indiana].
Speaker 1: And that was located?
Speaker 2: In East Chicago, Indiana.
Story_ID: 210156
Speaker 1: How do you remember your time and your life and experience in the church [Zion Baptist Church; Zion Missionary Baptist Church, East Chicago, Indiana] as a young man?
Speaker 2: Well there was, the church was very important.  I remember it as a warm place.  I remember the, both emotionally and environmentally, because in the wintertime, those little, those heaters were pumpin' and the, you could hear the noises they pumped and but I remember the sermons.  I remember how, I said they touched my young soul even though, you know, I wasn't that religious, I was always skeptical, but I've come to appreciate the value of religion but I was skeptical, even as a youngster.  That was one of the interesting things in our family.  Also, one of the things our family valued was expressing your viewpoint regardless of whether you differed, at the same time, we were supposed to be respectful of adults, and particularly, my father [Hugh Comer].  I remember my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] felt that our, the questions I raised about religion, we raised about religion, bordered on not being respectful, but my dad insisted that we raise those questions, allowed us to raise those questions because he felt that it was very important to express your viewpoints and have discussions about it and so, that was a family value, it was expressions, in expressing your viewpoint.  I just remember the church as a place where all of those sisters and brothers were people you respected, you cared about, they cared about you and it made it a very supportive place so that whenever rejections in the real world, or the bigger world, later on, the church was a place where you could feel accepted and supported.  And a powerful and important example was that, an experience I had once as a student at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] where I had a professor who graded the papers anonymously, was reading my paper as the best paper, and I was the only black in the class, it was a big class, and I was, he was reading it as an A paper.  He got to a question, a point that he wanted to question, and he said, "Whose paper is this?"  And I raised my hand.  From that point on, he ripped it apart, line for line, when he realized it was my paper.  That whole year was tough for me, going from being a highly successful high school student [at Washington High School; East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana] with very few racial problems in high school to a place in Southern Indiana that was racially tough and a number of experiences, not only that one, just destroyed my confidence and I made almost all Cs that first year.  That wasn't good enough to go to medical school.  I went home that summer and without being aware of it, I went back and touched base, went to meet all the sisters from my church and that touching base with the church, that place that I felt acceptance and warmth and good memories, I went back the next year, ready, and I was able to make the grades necessary to go on with my career--
Story_ID: 210157
Speaker 1: Staying with church life, church, the ambiance of the [Zion Baptist] Church [Zion Missionary Baptist Church, East Chicago, Indiana], were there any songs and music in the church that you felt very special at the time for you or that you recall?  Was there any--
Speaker 2: I recall my father's [Hugh Comer] favorite song was 'Life is Like a Mountain Railroad and in my own head, I'm sure I was thinking about real life and how that song represented real life and I, that, so that was an important song.  It stayed with me all my life.  Another was, 'Amazing Grace' and the senior sisters' group used to sing that song and that has been a very important song for me for that reason, but also there were just many, especially the spirituals that were very powerful, very important, and I, I happened to see the play '[The] Mahalia [Jackson Broadway Musical]' and I was just, you know, it took me back to the songs of my childhood and the memories of my childhood.  I could just see those people pouring down the aisles at the intermission and those songs they were singing and that had great meaning then and touched me greatly when I saw 'Mahalia.'  I remember, when we went to church on Sunday morning, walking down the street, all the homes had Mahalia [Jackson], the Five Blind Boys--
Story_ID: 210158
Speaker 1: When we went down the street on a Sunday morning, on our way to [Zion Baptist] Church [Zion Missionary Baptist Church, East Chicago, Indiana], all the homes on the street had Mahalia Jackson, the Five Blind Boys, the best-known gospel singers of the day, and I remember there's just something special about that that stays with me today.  Also those, the breakfast on Sunday morning, you know, my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] always had bacon and eggs and it was just a wonderful affair.  I always remember my dad [Hugh Comer], and my dad prayed and he prayed a lot on Sunday morning, but in the closet I could hear him praying and so on, but I remember on one occasion he was praying a long time and, you know, you could smell the bacon and you could see the eggs and so, and my brothers [Norman Comer and Charles Comer] and I were a little concerned and we started moving around and acting out, acting up, and we, we looked up and my mother opened one eye and looked at us (laughter).  That eliminated the acting up.  We closed our eyes but we thought it went on a little long there, praying, you know, for, "The seens, and protect us from the seens and unseens of life," and so on, but that was my dad.  He was deeply religious, deeply caring and religion was very, important part of his life.
Story_ID: 210159
Speaker 1: As you look back and think back about your time in the [Zion Baptist] Church [Zion Missionary Baptist Church, East Chicago, Illinois], is there any one individual that influenced you in any particular way that stood out in your life (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, Mrs. Johnson.
Speaker 1: Who was Mrs. Johnson?
Speaker 2: Mrs. Johnson, I opened my latest book with the discussion of Mrs. Johnson, my book, 'Leave No Child Behind[: Preparing Today's Youth for Tomorrow's World,' James P. Comer, M.D.].  I talk about how Mrs. Johnson came in one day all excited in church, and she said, "I had a vision about you.  I saw you as a little minister going all over the country to preach the gospel," and I--that wasn't my vision of my future but I thanked her respectfully and went on.  Now, every time I get on a plane or go anywhere to talk about child development, I said, you know, Ms. Johnson was right.
Speaker 1: Uh-hm.
Speaker 2: Ms. Johnson was in the right church but she was in the wrong pew.  I am not a minister, I am a child psychiatrist, preventive child psychiatrist but child development is a gospel of sort and the importance of it, anything for the good of mankind or humankind is really a gospel and she was right, but she was deeply concerned--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --always about us and being successful of our future.
Speaker 1: I read the beginning of that chapter (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --this morning, having breakfast--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and so I know what you're talking about.  Anybody else besides her?
Speaker 2: Mr. Lackey was a deacon with my dad [Hugh Comer] and my dad was so religious that he would never go to a ballgame on Sunday and yet the time that those men worked in the steel mill could go to the ballgames usually on Saturday or Sunday, Mr. Lackey used to take the four of us, sometimes the three boys, but the four of us to the Chicago Cubs ballpark [Wrigley Field, Chicago, Illinois] and we went often.
Speaker 1: How do you spell Lackey?
Speaker 2: L-A-C-K-E-Y.
Speaker 1: L-A-C-K-E-Y.
Speaker 2: Right, and there were other people in the church who did special things for us but I remember as I was watching '[The] Mahalia [Jackson Broadway Musical],' the play, I remember Mrs. Wilson [ph.] was our Mahalia and I remember her singing and I remember Ms. McCorkle [ph.] and those ladies who were in the front of the church.  I remember my dad, we used to have to sit right behind my dad on the deacon's row and I remember my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] sat two seats back and she could watch the back of our necks, you know, so if we turned, and we played around, she knew it, that we'd hear about it later, but it was, it was a very structured and important and powerful and warm experience overall.
Story_ID: 210160
Speaker 1: --Are you a church member today or do you go to church regularly today?
Speaker 2: I've started going again after many years.  I had some trouble in thinking about, hypocrisy bothered me and there were a lot of hypocrites, not only in the church, outside the church.
Speaker 1: So when did you start going?
Speaker 2: I started going again in the last ten years.
Speaker 1: And the church, where?
Speaker 2: I usually go here on the [Martha's] Vineyard [Massachusetts], I go regularly when I can.  When I go, I go to the chapel at Yale [University Church in Yale, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut].
Story_ID: 210161
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [James] Comer.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What is your earliest memory of growing up?
Speaker 2: I can just remember the walks in the, in the park with my dad [Hugh Comer], the lakefront [Lake Michigan] with my mom [Maggie Nichols Comer].
Speaker 1: How old were you about this, this time would you say?
Speaker 2: Four, maybe, about four.  There's an interesting story about four that I don't think I remembered it, I remember my mother talking about it and describing it.  When I was four years of age, around that, the doctor came to treat me and when he left I said, "I'm going to be a doctor when I get to be a big man."  My parents responded to that by going out and buying me a doctor's kit and playing with me and reminding me that the pills in there, the candy pills, were for the patients, not the doctor (laughter).  They played and encouraged and a neighbor came by from right around and she listened and watched and she said, "Why are you all encouraging him to be a doctor?"  She says, "We're poor people.  You know he will never be a doctor," and my mother's response to that was, "you can't say that, say that again, you will have to leave."  And so, not only was it an environment where you could have aspirations and they would be supportive, but they would be protected against the doubts that people were carrying within the neighborhood, and that was a black woman and doubts that came from outside of our own community.  And so they were protected always and we were always expected to succeed and protected against the doubts that we would succeed.
Story_ID: 210162
Speaker 1: Tell me about the street that you lived on [in East Chicago, Indiana] and tell me about your neighbors.  Who were your neighbors?
Speaker 2: You know, my street had at one end of it, Gargas Coal [and Oil] Company [East Chicago, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Would you spell that?
Speaker 2: Gargas, G-A-R-G-A-S, Gargas Coal Company and the railroad tracks were on the other side of Gargas, and on my street were steel mill workers and domestics like my parents [Hugh Comer and Maggie Nichols Comer], and right across the street but down just a little bit was Flickinger's Truck Company [sic. Flickinger Motor Service].  That's where they stored their trucks.
Speaker 1: Would you spell Flickinger's for us?
Speaker 2: F-L-I-C-K-I-N-G-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we used to play ball in the street and when the drains would fill up, water would rise, we'd float boats down the street.  And we played basketball in the alley behind the, our house, and we lived on a street where we had a duplex and my father and mother rented the downstairs and eventually the house in the back above the garage.  So all that was on one lot and my family had the next lot, they had a little store that they ran, five, six, seven, ten years maybe.  And it was a, you know, we were probably no better off but they managed very well so that we lived a little bit better than a lot of people around us but we actually earned no more money than most of the people around us.  But my parents got ahead by, they built the house we lived in with their own hands.  They, my mother and father pulled the bricks in there and then built that house with just minor help from professionals at one point.  So that they were enterprising people.
Speaker 1: Did other neighbors construct their homes also?
Speaker 2: No, nobody that I know of in that street constructed their own homes.
Speaker 1: How many houses were there on the street?
Speaker 2: There were only about ten houses on the street that, it was a short street between two more used streets and, but it was a good warm community, you know.  Everybody looked out for everybody else.  My mother described a time earlier before our birth, there was a storm that blew the house, blew the roof off of one of the homes and all the people came together and by nightfall, they had put that roof back on all by themselves.
Speaker 1: Is the house still there and the street still there?
Speaker 2: No, we went by.  The house is not there anymore, it's torn down, and there's a picture of it in my book about my mother, 'Maggie's American Dream[: The Life and Times of a Black Family,' James P. Comer, M.D.], but the house isn't there anymore, but fond memories.  It's interesting, when I look at the lot, I can't imagine that two houses were on that lot and that there was a little store next door, but that's where we used to play and, play sports and dug holes and I remember on one occasion we really got into it from my mother.  We dug a whole cave, and started living down there, you know.  We thought it was terrific and she was furious.  "Don't you know that that cave could, it could cave in and you'd be--" it never occurred in our little six-year old minds that you could get buried down there but we lived there.  So, we had a lot of fun and I remember it as a nice home and a nice street.  Most of the times it was great times.  There were some worrisome sad times.  I remember a family rented from my parents, rough kids, they were poorly socialized, they'd eat out in the street, and we couldn't, we weren't allowed to play with them because they were, they were just mean, tough.  And my parents, one, did not want us to pick up the habits that they had, but the kids were tough--
Story_ID: 210163
Speaker 1: What was the broader community like just outside your immediate neighborhood [in East Chicago, Indiana] (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, yeah, yeah--
Speaker 1: What was going on in the community as you recall?
Speaker 2: Let me say one more word about the community (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) All right, sure.
Speaker 2: My, on that street, there was, across the street from me, there was a man who, who, a young, at the time a young man who was a basketball player and an outstanding student, went on to become Phi Beta Kappa at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] and very next door to me there was a family with ten children and I think five or six of them became professional people, if not eight or more.  And yet on the other side of me was a family that had great difficulties and several of the other families were, but all of them were hard-working people who worked every day and, and most of them took care of their families well.
Speaker 1: Was the basketball player somebody whom we should know or would remember?
Speaker 2: No, no.
Speaker 1: Not particularly, okay.
Speaker 2: He did not play.  He went on to become a physician but he did not play professional ball or anything.
Speaker 1: His name?
Speaker 2: Andy Spencer [ph.].
Story_ID: 210164
Speaker 1: But there's a white family that lived across the alley [in East Chicago, Indiana], in back of us, who had less than maybe any of the black families and on the one occasion I went there, I was just shocked to see that they didn't really have a floor.  There was a dirt floor that they lived in.  The other thing was that the, around the corner from us, there was the Lakota Hotel [ph.] which was a flophouse, white, derelicts really, and they would stagger down the street, one at least, and he always wanted to play with us, you know.  My dad [Hugh Comer] would not let him play with us because he was drunk.  But what I came to realize from that experience was that I never had this notion that white people were better, smarter, lived under better conditions because we were in the middle.  We probably were better off than all of the white people on that--prior to the time I went to school and I lived in a neighborhood where black families were functioning very well, all except that one family, and they were good people, but that was the community that I remember.

Speaker 1: Before we move into your schooling, would you give me the names of your siblings and their birth order (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yeah, yeah my brother, Norman [Comer], I'm the oldest of my younger, of the younger four, my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] and father's [Hugh Comer] children.  My older sister [Louise Comer], my father's daughter, is twelve years, seventeen years older than me and I'm, I'll be seventy in September of '04 [2004].  My brother, Norman, is a year, about a year apart.  My brother, Charles [Comer], is next and my sister, Thelma [Comer Morris], is the youngest and I think she's a year and a half to two years younger than my youngest brother.

Speaker 1: The story about my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] and father [Hugh Comer], my father is twelve years older than my mother and they met in Sunday school and my father as the teacher and my mother as the student.  And my mother, because of her own experience, was very suspicious of my father in the beginning.  And when she discovered that he had a daughter [Louise Comer], had been married once before, she didn't want anything to do with him but he did seem like a nice guy.  So she insisted that he get a letter of recommendation from his ex-mother-in-law before she would go out with him.  And the ex-mother-in-law wrote him a very strong letter and they began to date and a year later they were married.  But it was twelve years before they had children and they reared my older sister and my mother continued to work as a domestic during that period and my father worked in the steel mills [in East Chicago, Indiana].
Speaker 2: So you had two sisters and two brothers?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right, okay.

Speaker 1: What sights, sounds and smells do you recall growing up or remind you of your growing up years in this neighborhood [East Chicago, Indiana], in this community, go ahead (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The railroad trains and the noise that they made that after a while they weren't disturbing noises but the sound of a train blowing in the night still catches me because that's what I remember.  And I remember it in particular because we loved our older sister [Louise Comer] and she was much older and she went back to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana] and we, I remember, we used to pray and during our prayers and we'd say, "Good night, Lou, and send this kiss all the way to Indiana University on the train."  That was the idea.  So the trains have a special meaning passing by.  I remember the hot tamale man or, yeah, hot tamale man coming by.  "Red hot, hot tamale" he'd--but we never bought anything because my parents always prepared the snacks for us at home (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: I worked on a fruit truck that used to come through.  I think I was twelve years old or so.  One of the important, and he used to yell when he came into, and he, from the time I was a little boy, and then when I was twelve or so, I worked on the truck.  It's one of these interesting experiences, I remember, that has stayed with me as an analogous situation.  I was a small kid and I had all these big buddies who were standing on the sideline, you know, and they wanted to take the fruit off the truck when he drove away.  My job was to protect the back of the truck but they were my buddies.  So, you know, I was in a bind.  And they'd all run after the truck.  So what I'd do was pick out one peach and I would throw it as far as I could and they would all dive after that one peach, and by the time they got up, the truck was gone.  And so, I watched, I watch political leaders and people distract people by throwing them one peach and they all dive.  Everybody fights over that one peach.  The truck's gone.  They, they were not entitled to the peach but people are entitled to rights and opportunities and so on.  Political leaders distract them from that with programs and things that aren't useful and helpful but everybody dives after that and forget that the real opportunity is being denied.
Speaker 1: That's a good analogy.
Story_ID: 210168
Speaker 1: Any other special memories of growing up [in East Chicago, Indiana] that we haven't, you haven't shared?
Speaker 2: Well, I do remember playing football in the street with my buddies and I remember the first young woman who played with us.  And I also remember Mrs. [Bertha] Bozeman in particular and her boys and girls, the young woman.  Ms. Bozeman was like my second mother and anything that I was, disagreed with my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer], I always tried it on Ms. Bozeman, and she always said the same thing but seeing that when you're a little bit removed, it, it's easier to accept and so, and that was the other thing, all of the adults around you were saying the same thing, reinforcing the same set of attitudes and values and ways of working.  But I remember discovering that Doris Bozeman was faster than me and how difficult that was and you begin to realize how early boy children learn to believe they're better than women at everything, you know, and I, Doris Bozeman ran down and caught a football over my head and that was disturbing, you know, that she could do that.  But I, but I eventually came to accept the fact that women are good when given the opportunity, they can do almost anything that men can do.  Men can't do everything women can do.  And so, but I do remember that.
Story_ID: 210169
Speaker 1: Elementary school, did you attend (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Let me tell you a story about my childhood just before you move on.
Speaker 1: Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: It's very important.  You know, the same Mrs. Johnson that I mentioned, one Sunday at Easter, I might have been four or five, six, we were all in line waiting for a Easter egg hunt, you know, Easter egg to be given to each child, and Mrs. Johnson came over and pulled me out of line because they were running out of Easter eggs and she knew that we had Easter egg hunts and eggs and everything at home that my parents [Maggie Nichols Comer and Hugh Comer] had prepared and that some of the children there would not receive an Easter egg at all if they didn't receive it at [Zion Baptist] Church [Zion Missionary Baptist Church, East Chicago, Indiana].  So she pulled me out of line and I didn't get an Easter egg and I'm sure she gave an explanation but, you know, I remember that all of my life, and I remember the kind of hurt and not getting that Easter egg with the group at the time.  Now she was right to do that I always point out but, you know, I wasn't a missionary yet, I was a six year old, and I wanted my Easter egg.  And so that I always remember about children, that children want to be like everybody else.  They want to receive the same things that everybody else receives and yet I would encourage the Ms. Johnsons of the world to do that, but also remember what children are like.

Speaker 1: What year did you start elementary school and what was the name of the school that you attended?
Speaker 2: I think it was 1939. I went to kindergarten at East Chicago [George] Washington Elementary School [East Chicago, Indiana].
Speaker 1: Okay, and what are your memories of the elementary school experience?  And tell us about some of the teachers that you remember.
Speaker 2: Well one of the most important memories was, my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] gave us a, gave me a party either in kindergarten or first grade.  She had the teacher buy--and she bought the ice cream, the teacher, and all the goodies, whatever we had, and it was my party.  It was very special.  Two things happened that really were very important.  One, a black woman who knew my family, saw me and didn't, in the first day a friend invited me to go by his house, I refused, and she told my mother and was proud of that but she didn't see me the second day and the kid insisted and so I went by his house and his mother was upstairs, this was a white kid.  Most of the kids in the class were white.  There were only three black kids in the class that I remember at the time.  The mother was upstairs and she leaned over and she says, "Are you the boy that had the party?"  And I said, "Yes."  And she was surprised and she says, "I didn't know," I think she said, colored people, but I'm not sure what she said, "did anything but fight and something all the time, you know.  Drink and fight all the time."  And I remember clinging to that fence, hurt, deeply hurt, which is why my mother didn't want us going any place else.  She was always protecting us against the racial insults and other kinds of things that could happen, but it happened.  So that there was the pride and the satisfaction of having this party and being the party boy and then having it challenged, or cancelled or diminished by this comment by this lady, and that is what black kids are up against all the time.
Story_ID: 210171
Speaker 1: Tell me about your teachers that you remember in elementary school [George Washington Elementary School, East Chicago, Indiana], though.  Are there any that stand out in your mind?
Speaker 2: Oh yeah, oh yeah.  Ms. Furmark and Ms. Walsh, the important ones, most important.
Speaker 1: The first name?
Speaker 2: Ms. Furmark and Ms. Walsh.
Speaker 1: Would you spell--
Speaker 2: Ms. Furmark was my kindergarten teacher.  F-U-R-M-A-R-K, I believe, and Walsh was W-A-L-S-H, and they were good friends and I remember years later when I was on the track team, eighth grade I think, track team, I remember stepping out with my uniform on and saw them coming down the street and I stepped back in because I wanted to step out just as they came back because I wanted them to be proud of me, and they were, you know.  And I, Mrs. Furmark had a tragic acc- well she was mugged years later and I was, let me stop, is that showing up because I'm tearing for some reason.  Ms. Furmark was mugged and I guess she's at, was in a nursing home for many years after that and I lost contact.  Mrs. Walsh, many years ago, maybe fifteen, I went back to visit my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] who was in the hospital at the time, and Ms. Walsh was a, maybe eighty-plus year old volunteer at the hospital, and when she saw me, she threw her arms about me and said, "Oh, my little [HistoryMaker Dr.] James [Comer]" but I was fifty-five years old but you're always my little James to your first grade teacher.  And she hugged me and then she stepped back and she says, "Oh, we just love the Comer children."  She said, "You came to school with those bright eager smiles and you got along so well with other children and you were so smart," and she went on and on, and I always point out that what she was talking about was the, the developmental experience that allowed us to go to school, elicit a positive response from school people and then school people will join with family to support our development in school and that's what made success in school and an opportunity for success in life possible and that many children, my friends, three friends in that class, all went on a downhill course, just as bright as anybody in my school.
Story_ID: 210172
Speaker 1: My school [George Washington Elementary School, East Chicago, Indiana] was made up of working-class white children and also professional class and managerial class, white children.  The sons and daughters of doctors and lawyers and managers of the steel mills and so on were all in that school and that's what made it such a great school and a great place is that the whole range was there.  There were fifty-some different ethnic groups in my high school [Washington High School; East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana] and there were mostly white and black and, you know, maybe by the time I finished high school, it was two-thirds to three-quarters white, and when I started there were, in elementary school, there were very few blacks.
Speaker 2: The elementary school went from kindergarten to what grade?
Speaker 1: To sixth grade and then seventh and eighth grade was in the high school but kind of separate but in the high school and it was right next door to each other--
Story_ID: 210173
Speaker 1: Before you moved into the high school building [Washington High School; East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana], okay, grade seven and eight, what kind of a student were you in the early grades?  How do you, how would you characterize yourself (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I think I made from C to A in the first three years and I think it was fourth grade where I made all A's and probably was mostly A's.
Speaker 1: Were you still thinking about medicine and being a doctor at that point?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were?
Speaker 2: Yeah, all the way through.  I never stopped thinking about being a doctor.  There were times when I flirted with the idea of being a lawyer and social justice.  [HistoryMaker] Dick [Richard] Hatcher, the first mayor of Gary [Indiana], was my classmate at Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].  I remember talking with him, he was thinking about changing to medicine, I was thinking about changing to law, but we both went back to law and medicine as our first goals.  I, I flirted with social work but I also realized that doctors had more power and I also understood growing up in East Chicago [Indiana], which is a politically tough place and, you know, there was corruption and so on, and I realized that doctors had more power and so I had this social interest and interest in medical care and I wanted to be well-off enough to be able to contribute in, in the same way that my parents [Maggie Nichols Comer and Hugh Comer] contributed even though they had very little money.  And so medicine turned out to be the way to do all those things and it turned out that, you know, I could get to psychiatry and address all the social issues that I had an interest in while still being in medicine.
Story_ID: 210174
Speaker 1: As we kind of wrap-up your [George Washington] Elementary School [East Chicago, Indiana] experience, K [kindergarten] to six [grade], what was your favorite or best subject during those early elementary grades?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure.  I know that the reading and writing were probably the most important to me.  In elemen- in [Washington] High School [East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana], it was the social behavioral sciences.  There was a course in propaganda in government that was my favorite course, ever, all the way through medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], undergraduate school [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana].  That propaganda course served me well because that was the first time I began to realize that you can't pay attention to what people say and that you have to examine it very carefully.  And I think everybody ought to have a propaganda course early.
Story_ID: 210175
Speaker 1: Would you give me the name of the junior, senior high school complex that you attended?
Speaker 2: Yeah, East Chicago Washington [Washington High School; East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana] and I went from elementary school [George Washington Elementary School, East Chicago, Indiana], I went to elementary school there, middle school and high school and it was all in the same area.
Speaker 1: I see, okay.
Speaker 2: The elementary school is right next door to the middle and high school.
Speaker 1: Okay, as you moved into the middle school grades, seven and eight, were you departmentalized in subject matter or did you begin to have more--
Speaker 2: Yeah, we were, we were departmentalized and we were also tracked, although I didn't realize at the time that it was tracking but it, you know, I remember one occasion I was accidentally put in the second track because I dropped out of a course and they were trying to fit in typing.  At any rate, I remember walking into the math, the only math course that was available under those circumstances, and all of the students that, which were many more black students in that said, "What are you doing in our class?"  And, you know, I realized then that it was the second track.  So I turned around and got it rescheduled.  So there was tracking and a disproportionate number of black students were in that second track and I was primarily, I was in the first track--
Story_ID: 210176
Speaker 1: What was your best subject in the middle school grades, seven and eight?
Speaker 2: Probably the same but I developed an interest in, I was good in the sciences and I enjoyed science and one of my favorite teachers, Ms. McCullough, and Ms. McCullough, I remember the time she had a, this was in high school [Washington High School; East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana], well actually, Ms. McCullough had a George Washington Carver film.  All my teachers were white from elementary school [George Washington Elementary School, East Chicago, Indiana] through, and first time I had a black teacher was Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] but Ms. McCullough had this film about George Washington Carver and it was totally out of context with what we were studying and I noticed that every time I kind of looked up, she was looking at me and her, her message was, you can, you can achieve like George Washington Carver and similar, I had Mrs.--
Speaker 1: Before we go on, would you spell McCullough for us?
Speaker 2: M-C-C-U-L-L-O-G-H [sic. McCullough], I believe.
Speaker 1: Thank you.
Speaker 2: And Ms. Murphy [ph.], I was head of the student body, she was the English teacher.  I was head of the student body and first black, and I was in her homeroom and there was a, some kind of privilege, speaking privilege that the head usually had that she thought was being denied to me.  She was a fiery red headed Irish woman and she tore out of that office and out of that room, down to the office and she was, she was gonna confront them, she did.  And then she came back and she asked me a question that clarified it for her and then she says, oh, okay.  So clearly, you know, there were teachers who, who were on my side and they were going to prevent racial discrimination.  On the other hand, I had one teacher who gave me a B, a person thirty points behind me a B, and the two people, one and two points ahead of me, an A at the end of the first grading period.  I, after a half an hour of talking with her, she finally said, "Well, you know, I just don't think you're capable of making an A."  That was the first ten weeks.  The second ten weeks, I was ahead of everybody but I didn't take any chance, I took her my book and I had, I told her that I had left my book and that was the first hour.  So I went around and collected all of my grades and went back, all A's and gave it to her.  She gave me my A.  That was, you know, I learned to do that at home from the way my family solved problems.  I didn't jump up in anybody's face, make a lot of noise, I just work hard and produce something that she could not reject.  That next year, or semester even, I saw her in the hall and "Just come here," she said. "There's this boy", and it was a black youngster, she says, "he's very smart but he is not working up to his ability.  You give, you tell me how I might be able to help him."  Very interesting.  I think the way I confronted her with her own racism in that incident with me caused her to examine her own behavior and respond differently.
Story_ID: 210177
Speaker 1: What kind of student were you in [Washington] High School [East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana]?  How would you characterize yourself as a student as you moved into grades ten, eleven and twelve?
Speaker 2: I was a good student.  I was one of the best.  I had areas that were really very important to me and areas that weren't so important but I was very good in the sciences and we didn't have composition very much but I think I was good in composition but we didn't have very much of it.
Speaker 1: What were the areas that you weren't as interested in and perhaps didn't--
Speaker 2: Math.  I was not interested in and not as good in.  I'm reluctant to say that because I, you know, children imitate what's said.  My older sister [Louise Comer], I love very much, didn't like math and I am afraid that I accepted that as okay because she didn't like math and so I'm reluctant to say it because young kids will pick up on what they hear and make that okay.  Because I say, I say that because later on I did very well in math but I needed to do well in math to get into medical school.
Speaker 1: I assume you took chemistry and physics in high school?
Speaker 2: I did.
Speaker 1: And were, was it a qualitative approach or quantitative?
Speaker 2: It was, actually it was both.
Speaker 1: But how'd you overcome the math then?  Was that a problem for you?
Speaker 2: I, actually it was much more qualitative than quantitative of the kind that I had when I was in college but the, I could do the math--
Speaker 1: So math didn't pose a problem to you then in chemistry and physics?
Speaker 2: No, no.  Chemistry and physics in college, I did because I had to and, and didn't come as easy but once I had to do math and the math and chemistry and physics, I did it because I wanted to get into medical school, but I didn't like it.  I liked things that had to do with people and biological things.

Speaker 1: Staying with the [Washington] High School [East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana] for just a minute, you said you were president of the student body.
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: What other extracurricular activities were you involved in in high school?
Speaker 2: Everything, everything.  The choral club, sports activities, I was very active and I used to always take, student government was the, kind of my main thing and I always took one or two courses in the summertime so that I could take the minimum amount of courses during regular school.
Speaker 1: This is during high school years?
Speaker 2: In high school, so that I could be active in everything and I just loved, you know, politics and government and sports.
Story_ID: 210179
Speaker 1: Tell me about your friendships in high school [Washington High School; East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana].  Who were your friends?
Speaker 2: Well I had a range of friends.  You know, there's a--in [George Washington] Elementary School [East Chicago, Indiana], my friends were largely the white kids and some black kids but, you know, my friend, my good friends that I went off to elementary school with, remain my good friend, black friends, we remain friends outside of school but, you know, they were already peeling off academically.  They were not doing well, academically, and they were not getting along well in school, they were, the troublemaking kids in school.  We remain friends but I didn't do much with them except, you know, play ball in the street.  By the time I got to middle school and high school, there were black kids coming in who also were doing well, academically, and had future orientations for college and professional careers, and so on, and they became my major friends.  I always got along well with everybody and that was, in part, because of political interest.  At the same time, I, you know, I was a good dancer.  I, good ball player, loved sports, and I was respected for that by the kids in the street and at the same time, I did well academically--
Story_ID: 210180
Speaker 1: Any particular sport that you were outstanding in or--
Speaker 2: No, I was never outstanding in any of them.  I played (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Well which one would you consider to be--
Speaker 2: --but basket- but I loved basketball most of all.  Too small for football, but basketball was my sport.

Speaker 1: You moved on from [Washington] High School [East Chicago Central High School; East Chicago, Indiana] to Indiana University [Bloomington, Indiana].
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: How do you recall your entry into the university?  What--
Speaker 2: I was scared to death.  Indiana was the first time, you know, outside of an admiring and supportive community, family community, school community.  It was just the first time that there wasn't acceptance as a--
Speaker 1: How far away were you from home [East Chicago, Indiana]?
Speaker 2: I was, it's about five hours' driving time to Indiana and you had to go through Indianapolis [Indiana] to get there so, on the bus, so it was even longer, but the difference was in the social environment.  East Chicago [Indiana], blacks, whites and the growing number of Hispanics--but when we started there were very few Hispanics--we all got along well.  People remember that, the people talk, there was a time when East Chicago was one-third white, one-third black and one-third Hispanic and I met the head of one of the foundries recently.  He was talking about, what an amazing town it was in the way the groups got along with each other, you know, and worked things out.  When I went to Indiana University, that was a segregated town and it was the first time blacks, whites didn't interact in--
Speaker 1: How'd you feel about (simultaneous)--?
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) respectful ways.
Speaker 1: How'd you feel about that?
Speaker 2: I was scared, scared, and came to doubt myself and whether I belonged there, whether I could make it there, and I acted out, and this is something I thought about a lot and I was glad Claude Steele, who eventually did the work that showed the impact and the rumor of inferiority and so on because that's what I was struggling with.  And I remember acting out, on one occasion, I made the lowest score in the room, in zoology.  Now this was a course that you either do well in or you change your major, you know, and I had all these questions about whether I had a right to be there, whether I was as smart as all the other kids there, mostly white kids.  They had their cars and they had their, you know, fraternity houses and sorority houses and we were marginalized on the campus and so you doubt yourself.  And I was asking a question through behavior, do I belong here?  Lowest score, and fortunately, I talked with the laboratory assistant in zoology, and he came around and he took a seat on the bench next to me in the lab, and he looked at me, looked me right in the eye, he says, "You know, I've talked to you," he says, "you can do better than this."  Now, on the next test, I made the highest score in the room.  The reason is that somebody with authority at the, at the university, had answered my question.  Do I belong here?  Yes.  Can you do better?  Yes.  I expect you to do better, was what was said, and he did.  That's the same message my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] gave me years before when a young woman came to our school who had--fifth grade maybe, and she said, "I know your mother."  And I asked my mother how she knew her.  My mother pointed out that she had worked for her mother years before.  She could see that that bothered me a little bit because, you know, ten years of age, status issues and you're trying to figure out where you fit in the scheme of things.  My mother said to me, "You're just as smart as she is, you're as clean as she is and you could do just as well and you had better."  Now, same message, years later, from that laboratory assistant turned me around and enabled me to do well.
Speaker 1: That was a major turning point for you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yup.
Speaker 1: --as you entered the university--
Story_ID: 210182
Speaker 1: Any other major turning points during your college years [at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana], your first four years of college that you recall?  Any incidents or things that were dramatic in your life for you as a college student?
Speaker 2: Well I remember some questions about interracial dating that really caused me problems and I really avoided it.  Actually I was going against the wishes of my parents [Maggie Nichols Comer and Hugh Comer] but I was a curious type, I was defiant also, quietly defiant.  I never made a lot of noise about it but I, I often explored areas that were forbidden, you know, and so a white woman asked me to, to go to the library.  So we had a library date.  And I remember that it was so difficult, so difficult.  Everybody's watching and I think, I'm not sure, that I actually stopped going to that class and didn't do well in it as a result of that experience.  I didn't want to have contact with her.  I just remembered but I, you know, you can't, I can't even dig it up what actually happened but I remember that was a traumatic experience and I struggle with the whole issue of race during that period.  Emmett Till was killed during that period and I came very close to being a hater at that, and did go through a short period.  Before all my prior experiences with my white friends in [George Washington] Elementary School [East Chicago, Indiana], middle school, high school [Washington High School; East Chicago Central High School, East Chicago, Indiana], many in college, forced me to, to confront that there was much more complicated, and even at Indiana University I had professors who, who went out of their way to be supportive and, I remember an incident where one professor knew that in sociology and he knew that I was a good student and he, he deliberately went all around, asked everybody this question, I was, just one other black kid in the class and everybody's question came back to me and I got the right answer.  And he was deliberately showing white students that there was a smart black kid.  Another one did something very similar to that, but my point is, is that I finally had to come to grips with the fact that it wasn't all about race, it was something else going on here which is why understanding the role of race became central and what, that eventually led me away from a plan to become a general practitioner.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Understanding race and understanding poverty and trying to do something about it grew out of such situations.
Story_ID: 210183
Speaker 1: Were there any organizations or activities during your years at Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that further developed and nurtured your interest in medicine?  Anything that happened, undergraduate that propelled you into medical school?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't medicine, it was, it was my fraternity that provided the kind of place of belonging at Indiana University.
Speaker 1: What fraternity was that?
Speaker 2: That was Alpha Phi Alpha [Fraternity] and I became president of the fraternity and, and went back to the fiftieth anniversary because it was that fraternity that saved me at that time, all my brothers eventually from that fraternity, but the fraternity life and the mutual support in a place where you weren't accepted even, let's say across the board you weren't accepted, there were many people who were accepted and supportive but the fraternity played a very important role and that confidence that I got there is what enabled me to go forward.
Speaker 1: I had the identical experience when I went to Boston University [Boston, Massachusetts].  It wasn't Alpha Phi Alpha--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --it was Kappa Alpha Psi [Fraternity]--
Speaker 2: Right.

Speaker 1: Tell me about your admission to medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  How'd you feel about that?  Tell me about the beginning of medical school.
Speaker 2: Well it's interesting because Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana] had a program that admitted people at the end of their junior year and I should have been admitted at the end of the junior year.  They also had a quota system and I was not admitted because there were seniors who had, who had to be considered and they were admitted.  My father [Hugh Comer] died the summer before and lived all of his life to see me become a physician and see me into medical school and it was so important to him and important to me that I was so angry about that that when I was admitted in my senior year, I was also admitted to Howard and a couple other places and I had decided that I had been in predominantly white settings long enough that I needed to go into a black environment and I decided to go to Howard because of that.  It was the best decision, one of the best decisions I made in my life in that I needed the black experience and I needed to begin to understand also that all of the problems of the world are not due to race.  That there were personalities, that there were anxieties, there're all kinds of reasons that people behaved inappropriately and that black people could end up behaving inappropriately, they could be very supportive and I established roles and relationships at Howard that I might not have established anywhere else and social roles--

Speaker 1: Tell us about your four years at Howard medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].  What was that like for you being a medical school student?
Speaker 2: Well, again, I was struggling to find, to find my place and the thing I wanted to do because I had these competing concerns.  I had the social issues and social justice concern, I had the medical school because medical school for all the reasons I mentioned were, you know, that was going to solve a lot of problems and I wanted to do something, contribute something but I wasn't sure it was medicine and so these competing interests meant that I wasn't always concentrating on my medical school activities and so my grades ranged from Cs to A's, top of the class sometimes depending on where I was at that period, and, and sometimes I just did average work but my mind was always struggling, always afire with trying to understand all of the issues, the class situations at Howard, the race situations at Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana], the race class in the world, poverty, all those concerns were there and struggling with them all the way through and, and so I had times when I was an A student and times when I was a student of the world and it shows in my performance.

Speaker 1: --The first wave of the Civil Rights Movement, as I call it, from '55 [1955] to '65 [1965], you were in medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], you were in Indiana [University, Bloomington, Indiana], how did the larger Civil Rights Movement affect you and the students at Indiana and at the medical school?  Did you get caught up in any of that?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I, I didn't get caught up in a large way.  I was, I walked in the protests at Indiana University, protest segregation of the bars and restaurants right off the campus but I wasn't greatly involved in it.  I'm also not a confrontational person.  I liked to get to the key decision makers and have discussions and work things out and bring out and bring about, change their minds, that was basically the way I operate, but I did, and also when I was at Howard, I think, maybe it was not, well I remember trying to get classmates to join the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] and various activities.  I had a consciousness about race but I also had my priorities straight.  I knew I had to finish medical school and I had to concentrate on making it.  Later on I marched in the, March on Washington in Washington [D.C.], not the larger one [March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom].  At that time I was moving to Michigan and I had to receive my supplies so I couldn't, I couldn't be there, wanted to be there, but couldn't.  But I always had, I was in it and with it and I remember with boxes stacked that had arrived unpacked.  I unpacked the only box, the television, and listened to [Reverend Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and just screaming at him, "You tell 'em Martin," you know.  I'm in that room all by myself.  So that I had great concern, always, but varied involvement and also I always had this feeling that the confrontation was not going to get it, that structures had to change and that I was more about changing structures than confronting people.
Story_ID: 210187
Speaker 1: It was like with school integration.  I was in school integration before there was school integration in that they tried to, they did, integrate my elementary school [George Washington Elementary School, East Chicago, Indiana] in fifth grade, sixth grade, and I watched what happened and it was problematic in that the black students were marginalized, students who had not been there and yet my teachers and my white friends were not deeply racist.  There was an interactional problem that nobody addressed and often I was the one who addressed it because my older sister [Louise Comer] had been the much loved teacher of the students who were brought over and I had been in the school for a long time and I was often the person who could interact with both groups and make it possible for us to get along.  I still remember one incident where I was fifth grade, sixth grade, where we had selected, and there was, every week a different chairperson and the white students were forever selecting white students and, and finally I stood up and complained, you know, and that changed things.  They began to select blacks also.  Now, when I sat down, I was a little worried because, you know, twelve years old maybe and my, and I'm worried about my teacher's reaction.  I looked around and she's sitting in the back, needlepointing, you know, and she winked at me and, and she was supportive.  So that's my point.  They were not deeply racist but there was nobody to bring them together and that was the problem with the way the Brown versus Board [Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954] was carried out that there was no infrastructure.  There was no way to bring people together and it was all about reaction and not about trying to promote the necessary understanding, getting the leadership in place that could make things happen without a fight.  Now, some, maybe it had to happen the way it happened but I'm not sure because a lot of the feelings and a lot of the problems that I saw early, we avoided.
Story_ID: 210188
Speaker 1: Who were the medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] faculty that you remember today that may have influenced you?  Were there any particular people at the medical school that were important to your medical school years (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I remember the chaplain and I don't remember his name, but he was the uncle of a classmate of mine and we went to visit him at his home and that was one of the first and very positive experiences at Howard, you know.  My doctor at home, the one I wanted to be like, my family doctor, was a model and a good model, he and his wife, and their son, we played together.  So, he was a good model but I had never been around a number of well-educated black people and thoughtful and contributing and involved in all the activities of the mainstream.  That's what happened to me at Howard and mostly through the chaplain and my classmate (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) And his name?
Speaker 2: I can't remember his name but he was very important and very smart and very thoughtful and that was the other thing is there're very smart and thoughtful black people all around, thinking about the same issues I was thinking about but had nobody really to think with because most of the kids weren't thinking about those things and that was the thing that I enjoyed about college, also, is that you could think about all kinds of things but particularly at Howard you could think about all kinds of things with very bright people and very involved and very accomplished people.  So there were lots of role models.
Story_ID: 210189
Speaker 1: I'd like to pursue a little further some of the medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.] faculty who were special to you, who influenced you, that you remember. You remember their teaching techniques, their methodology.  One that I knew well, not as a medical school student, was William Montague Cobb--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --but tell us who your favorites were.
Speaker 2: Well he was one of my favorites and I remember a procedure that he taught us and he said, "You know, you look like a hero if you're able to do this," and he says, "and it's all about knowing your anatomy," and that's where there's a dislocation or the jawbone comes out from under the, so it's the cephalo- mandibular dislocation, it's called, and I walked, as an intern early on, I walked in and there was a guy with this rare problem, just as he had predicted, and I was the only one in the hospital [St. Catherine Hospital, East Chicago, Indiana] who knew how to reset it, and reset it.  And it, they thought I was a genius but I always remember Mordecai [sic.] saying that as a way of demonstrating the importance of anatomy and he was a spectacular teacher.  But we had a lot of spectacular teachers.  Moses [Wharton] Young was a neuroanatomist and Jack [E.] White was one of my favorite, urologist, and--
Speaker 1: Why did you like Jack White?  What was special about him?
Speaker 2: Well, for one thing, Jack was, Jack liked me and we were both short and spirited and, and I thought he was very bright and I, I just liked him.  He asked, he had a way of teaching, also in raising questions that, that I enjoyed.  Lester Young [sic.], [Walter] Lester Henry [Jr.], he was everybody's doctor.  We all, I don't know how he made any money because all the medical students thought he was so good.  We all went to him with everything we had or thought we had.  Dr. [Samuel] Bullock and, there was a surgeon, can't think of his name right now, but any rate--
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  [Burke "Mickey"] Syphax?
Speaker 2: No, there was another surgeon, but I liked Syphax also but his name starts with a B, E.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  [Erman] Edgecombe?
Speaker 2: Edgecombe, Edgecombe, was really my favorite in the clinical years.
Speaker 1: What was his specialty, do you remember?
Speaker 2: I think it was gastroenterol[ogy]--I'm not sure, I'm not sure, but I just remember him being a very impressive teacher and concerned person.  He, he died of a heart attack in the [sic. when leaving] [Washington National] Airport [Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Washington, D.C.].  I always remember being saddened greatly by that because he had so much to contribute and was a fairly young man.  There were just many good teachers in the medical school and there was a good spirit and it was, it was important to me to be in an environment with so many outstanding blacks and black males also and I, it was just very important.
Story_ID: 210190
Speaker 1: At what point in the process did you decide that psychiatry was going to be your medical specialty?  When did that happen?
Speaker 2: Well, it's interesting that all through medical school [Howard University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.], I didn't think much of psychiatry.  As a matter of fact, I used to, I had derogatory names for, called it "witch doctor," I think, okay.  So, it was only after medical school when I began, really, to get very interested in social problems and began to think about how I could deal with the social problems.  It was, I was in the [United States Public Health] Service in Washington [D.C.] and it was in the United States Public Health Service, as a way of doing my [U.S.] military time, and during one of the initial interviews, one of the psychiatrists that I went to see as part of the orientation, she listened to my interest and things I was concerned about and she says, "Oh you'll be a psychiatrist."  I said, "What's the"--
Speaker 1: Now was this after your internship?
Speaker 2: This was after my internship.
Speaker 1: Well, where did you do your internship and how long was that?
Speaker 2: I did my internship back in my hometown, East Chicago, Indiana.  I did it at St. Catherine Hospital [East Chicago, Indiana] planning to become a general practitioner in my hometown.  It was watching my three friends go on a downhill course at that point.  They had been on a downhill course for a long time but me observing it and also observing many bright black, bright able black people, not doing well, and so it was a question of, what is this?  Why aren't they doing well?  And going to homes where people were just depressed much more than any medical problem.  I did some moonlighting and would go into homes and see these people.  It was social depression.  It was not that they had any real mental illness or, that's real also, but it was not biologically based primarily or caused.  Observing that made me not want to go into practice but to give myself time to think about what was going on and that led me into service, into the public health service.  And while there, I did some volunteer work--
Speaker 1: But you completed an internship now before you went into public health?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: How long was your internship?
Speaker 2: One year.
Speaker 1: And where did you go from the internship?
Speaker 2: From the internship, I went to do my military service time in the United States Public Health Service rather than do it in the Reserves [Reserve Components of the U.S. Armed Forces], as I had planned and go right into general practice, and so I changed my mind and went in to give myself time to think about what was going on, what was happening to me also because I could see that my interest in medicine and practicing medicine was dwindling and that I had much more concern about the social issues and social problems around.  That year, during my internship, I probably read more about slavery and social problems than I did my medical books.  Now, I had to--I was still doing well as an intern and everybody expected, I got invitations to join the predominantly white medical groups in the suburbs, invitation to practice with some of the biggest practitioners in my hometown but I wanted to examine things and reflect and had time to think about things and so I went into the service.  And while there, I did some volunteer work with the bootstrap operation called Hospitality House [Washington, D.C.], helping people who had been thrown off the welfare rolls and there, again, I saw bright children and able people who wanted their children to do well and watched them unable to help their children, schools that weren't serving their children well.
Speaker 1: Now where was this happening?  Where--
Speaker 2: In Washington, D.C.
Speaker 1: In Washington, okay.
Story_ID: 210191
Speaker 1: I remember on one occasion in this Hospitality House [Washington, D.C.], I was a volunteer sitting reading with the kids, and these kids were bright as anybody and yet, you know, they're in trouble.  I remember on one occasion the, it was Easter season, one kid was crying in the corner, quietly, and it turns out that he had been told by his teacher that, "If you can't bring a dime back for the Easter egg hunt, then you should not come back yourself."  That got to me.  His mother couldn't help him because she literally did not have the dime.  I gave him the dime, he went back to school, but I said, what is going on in the schools?  You know, why would you do that to a kid?  And that made me, began to realize, that these kids were in trouble.  I remember sitting reading to them and they were bright, able, good kids and then going around the corner and there were these day-labor camps almost, or places where men lined up to get jobs and here are these big, able black men all lined up yelling, for, it was a scene out of slavery, you know, where the, the employer or his agent was standing on the back of a truck and he's picking, this one and that one and the other one, you know, and these guys, with their shirts off, it looked like slaves and I said, these kids are going to be in that same lineup in just a few years unless they get an education and the schools not serving them.  So, that led me to raise the question, why aren't our institutions serving our kids well and where do you learn more about that?  That led me to the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan].  I wasn't sure public health would serve me well but I needed more time and it was also an opportunity to get some more training that I could use at home if I wanted to practice but also explore the question of why the institutions aren't working the way they should.  And I remember Paul [B.] Cornely, who was another one of my professors at Howard [University College of Medicine, Washington, D.C.].
Speaker 2: Would you spell the last name?
Speaker 1: C-O-R-N-E-R-L-Y [sic.].
Speaker 2: Thank you.
Speaker 1: Yeah, C-O-R-N-E-L-Y, I think, Cornely.  I remember him saying once that the improvement of medicine was due more to the work at public health than any physician, than all the physicians put together, he said.  And I think I resented that as a future physician at the time but it did occur to me that prevention was needed in this situation because you could never, on a one-to-one basis, help all of these kids and that something had to be done with the institutions.
Story_ID: 210192
Speaker 1: And so that led to public health and it was in public health, and my time there at the University of Michigan [Ann Arbor, Michigan], a year, and courses and administration and ecology and then it was about environment but, you know, you could see the connection between the interactions of the environment on, on environmental conditions in the society and the human interactions and it was that connection that made me begin to think about how the school could give children the experiences that they should receive at home and involve the home in ways that could make it possible for them to be successful in life, and that led me, you know, I needed then to know more about people.  So that led me into psychiatry and child--and adult psychiatry first and in adult psychiatry.  I realized that most of the problems started with--in their childhood, and so that led me into child psychiatry.  So then I had public health psychiatry, child psychiatry but also the diagnostic skills and mindset that medicine provided me and that eventually led me into schools when, I left the training in psychiatry, child psychiatry, and went back to Washington [D.C.] planning, because there was no, nothing for me to do.
Story_ID: 210193
Speaker 1: Well, where did you get your training in psychiatry now?  You left the School of Public Health [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan].
Speaker 2: Public health, I went to Yale [School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut].
Speaker 1: For your--
Speaker 2: Training in psychiatry, yeah.
Speaker 1: --psychiatry training.  And what year was that that you went to Yale?
Speaker 2: Let's see.  I went to Yale in '64 [1964] and from '64 [1964] to '67 [1967], did my training, two years in adult, one year in child, finished my training in child, in Washington [D.C.], because the [U.S.] Public Health Service called me back.
Speaker 1: Would that have been considered a residency then?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Your three years at Yale?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 210194
Speaker 1: Then I went back because the [U.S.] Public Health Service, by that time, the Civil Rights Movement had really heated up, that was '67 [1967], '68 [1968], it was the long hot summers.  And so, I was very dissatisfied because they were not interested in the Civil Rights Movement or what was going on there and that's all I was interested in by then.  And so I couldn't understand why they weren't interested in these conditions and their interest was only about doing research, you know, and not about action research.  And so, I got an offer to come back to Yale [School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut] to work in schools in a project [School Development Program] that Dr. Albert [J.] Solnit, who actually was my chief mentor at Yale and the important supporter of my career and whose idea of the school work, it was his idea.
Speaker 2: Would you spell his name for us?
Speaker 1: Albert, A-L-B-E-R-T, Solnit, S-O-L-N-I-T, and he brought me back to run this program and we went into the two worst, lowest achieving schools in the city.
Speaker 2: And what were those schools?
Speaker 1: The [Simeon] Baldwin [Elementary School, New Haven, Connecticut] and [Martin Luther] King [Jr. Elementary School, New Haven Connecticut] schools, and they were thirty-second and thirty-third in achievement out of thirty-three schools, and we eventually turned it around and--
Speaker 2: Well tell me about that going in, that, that intervention, getting in--
Speaker 1: Well, it was absolutely chaotic in the beginning because, you know, nobody really knew how to intervene at that point and there was still a question of whether we should try and integrate the schools or not.  My previous experience with integration told me that that was going to be a waste of time and that we really ought to concentrate on creating vital communities where the adults could work together and support the development of children and that was, in part, because that had been my experience.  I knew that's how I made it and my friends were just as bright as me, anybody in my family, anybody in our school, and yet they went on a downhill course.  If you--and they were in integrated settings.  So just integrating the school wasn't going to make it.  The question was, how do you make it a vital setting?  And that's what we began to focus on and we were on, it was so chaotic, we were almost thrown out the first year.  It was chaotic because it wasn't put together properly, it wasn't planned properly and nobody was at fault, nobody knew how to do it.  And we gradually realized that there was no leadership group in there and we gradually brought together a framework that created a good environment and that environment permitted support for development from all of the adults in the school for all of the children in the school.  And with support for the development, the kids could learn and that's what happened, and went from being a chaotic setting to a very good, warm relationship, supportive setting, and then they could teach and the kids could learn.
Speaker 2: Now was this your Yale [University] Child Study Center [New Haven, Connecticut]?  Was this--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, it was, okay, and that was for about a year and then you went back--
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: No?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: Go ahead, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: The, I was at the child, at Yale for two years training in psychiatry, then I had one year of training in child psychiatry, then I went to the [U.S. Public Health] Service, they called me back, and I finished my training in child psychiatry while in the service and that's when Al Solnit, from the Yale Child Study Center, where I had done my training in child psychiatry, called me back to run a program that was funded by the Ford Foundation and it was, he was the head of the program.  He was the head of the Child Study Center and he appointed me as head of the school program and that's where we started the work in the school from there.
Story_ID: 210195
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-seven [1967], '68 [1968], Hillcrest Children's Center; [Hillcrest Children and Family Center] Washington, D.C.--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --what was that?
Speaker 2: That was the year that I was back in Washington after my first year, after my three years at Yale [School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut].  Sixty-seven [1967], '68 [1968], I was at the Hillcrest Children's Center and that's where I finished my child training while in the [U.S.] Public Health Service.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And that was my [U.S.] military service time as well.
Story_ID: 210196
Speaker 1: Would you tell us now about the flourishing and the growth and development of what is known as the Comer Process and your [Comer] School Development Program?  Would you kind of lay that out for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And tell us where it is today, 2004.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I made a, I made an error.  The two years of [U.S.] military service came right after my internship [at St. Catherine Hospital, East Chicago, Indiana].  Then I did the two years training in, then I went to School of Public Health [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan], two years training in adult psychiatry and a year training in child psychiatry at Yale [School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut].  Then I went to the Hillcrest Children's Center [Hillcrest Children and Family Center, Washington, D.C.] for a year and then I was recruited back to Yale to run the School [Development] Program [Yale University Child Study Center, New Haven, Connecticut], and that's when we went into the schools [Simeon Baldwin Elementary School and Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School, New Haven, Connecticut] that were thirty-second, thirty-third in achievement out of thirty-three schools.  They were chaotic, they were the worst in the system.  And I remember in that chaos, and kids can't learn in this environment, and I knew that environment was important based on development, based, what I knew about child development and based on what I knew from my own personal experience and so we set out to try and change the environment.  Now I say, it makes it sound like we deliberately did that, we knew what to do.  We were really trying to survive because the parents wanted to throw us out of there.  It was so chaotic and it was chaotic because nobody know what to do, and also everybody was trying to exploit the situation, some to do good, some to do bad, some to run for office and some, and so all of the adult interests were at play and the child's, and the children's needs were being ignored.  They were using the traditional method of teaching and with the understanding, and the traditional understanding, that the children with the best brains will get it and those, the others, you know, too bad, they won't get it, and they're not able and, you know, they'll go to steel mills and somewhere but there weren't any steel mills left.  So they're going to go on a downhill course because they can't get the education needed to get a job and take care of family, take care of themselves and they're going to transmit to the next generation the problems that they had.  So we had to interrupt the cycle in some ways and yet what we were really thinking about, how do you survive here?  So what we did was to create a governance and management team that was made up of parents, teachers, administrators, all the adult stakeholders in school.  We had to keep it small enough so that, you know, we could work and so it had to be representative and we created other components as we realized it was necessary.  For example, what does the governance and management team do?  Well you need to have a comprehensive school plan and that's what I realized, schools didn't have any plan, at least the poor plans, poor schools.  People just came in and they taught and, taught what they were told, and they didn't expect the kids to get it anyway and there was no plan.  There was no direction.  And so we realized that not only did you need an academic plan, you needed a social plan.  How do you make this a good place?  And what kind of activities do you have?  And so we created a comprehensive school plan that was both academic and social and there were subcommittees to deal with various parts of that but the governance and management team representative of all the adults had the authority in the school and that's what was missing before and you had, now it could direct activities and create activities as needed so that the comprehensive school plan, people worked on that and that gave them a sense of direction, you know.
Story_ID: 210197
Speaker 1: And then we [Comer School Development Program] developed a staff development program that helped them gain the skills necessary to carry out their comprehensive school plan.  And then we had assessment and modification on an ongoing basis so that you looked at both your social program and your academic program and then began to make adjustments on an ongoing basis that brought about gradual improvement.  Now, so that those were the three operations of the school and, what we call the school mechanism, was the comprehensive school plan.  There were two other mechanisms.  One was the parent team and they had their people serving on the governance and management team and they also helped carry out, particularly the social program of the school, and the social program addressed all those things.  It took all those things that schools were doing, willy-nilly in the school, you know, maybe there was a Christmas program, maybe there was a Thanksgiving program, maybe, and we took all those things and we also looked at periods when there were problems, like after Christmas, everybody had the blahs, you know, so you schedule the Spring Fling during that but we created a calendar that picked up the, the rhythm of the school and needs of the school and needs of the people and put a social calendar in that was as important as the academic program.  Now that comprehensive school plan carried out by the parents, by the governance and management team, just began to create a different spirit and, in the school, and reduce behavior problems.  Now, we also had the other third mechanism was then called the Mental Health Team, now it's called a School Staff Support Team.  What they did was to bring, now this is social workers, psychologists, special education teacher, any helping professional in the school, was on that team, and at times they called in people from outside who had special expertise when to address needs of children.  They did two things, one was to address the needs of individual children, or small groups of children, but also to help everybody think about how you'd make the school more child-friendly so that all the things we were doing that created problems for children, they would help us think about how you change that.  And all of their colleagues then began to think and understand that troublesome behavior among children is caused by the conditions in the school and the interactional problems that they create.  For example, we had a child who was about eight years of age who was brought up from rural North Carolina and dropped in New Haven [Connecticut] by a parent, by an aunt, that he was living with, and she kept on to work and he was taken directly to the classroom.  Well, the child was frightened.  He had been in a warm, tight-knit community on a Friday, and on a Monday, he's up here among all these strangers, you know.  The teacher had had three transfers the week before and with a nod of her head, she conveyed frustration and rejection to that child.  That child panicked.  He kicked the teacher in the leg and he ran out of the classroom.  Now we thought that was a fairly healthy response but for an eight year old but it's the kind you get sent to the principal for, punished, scolded, sent back.  If somebody laughs at you, you punch 'em in the mouth, you get sent back.  It goes around and around till your labeled disturbed.  Then you're sent off to somebody like me to have your head fixed.  Rather than doing that, we said, you know, we had the teachers think about what it must be like to be eight years of age and to be in a strange place without the support of your community, parents and so on and all these strange people.  How do you make it?  The teachers began to understand what happened to them when they went to Europe and there's this funny money and they felt insecure and angry and so on when they thought they were cheated and so on and they could empathize with the child.  They began to think of all the things they could do in the classroom and help the child make it.  And then we thought of all the things you could do in the school to bring about change.  You have orientation, preparation of students, class, the student, newcomer, and so on, and we reduced the number of behavior problems as a result of that.  And so, prevention then of problems rather than trying to correct or change a child, or blaming a child, understanding that this was normal, desirable behavior on the part of children, and that you had to channel it and you had to create structures that channeled that frustration and aggressive behavior.  That aggressive behavior grew out of the threat that the child was experiencing and so by reducing the threat, the aggressive behavior went away and the energy was channeled--
Story_ID: 210198
Speaker 1: All of the theory, the development, the structures, the frameworks, the interconnections that you've just described, including the experience with this young man from the South, this was all within the New Haven [Connecticut] public schools, is that right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And there were three other parts [of Comer School Development Program].  I've really given the six of the nine components, basic components of the part.  There are three others.  One, was no-fault problem-solving, consensus decision-making and no paralysis or collaboration behavior.  So that you can't paralyze the principal, authority figures, when you're on the governance and management team, but, and you have to work collaboratively and everybody started working, particularly the governance in management and it spread through the school where you don't concentrate on who did it, you know, you concentrate on how do we solve it.
Story_ID: 210199
Speaker 1: If I understand the framework of the structure [Comer School Development Program], you looked at the adults that were in the school, including the principal on down, looked at the parent population and then you had a mental health team.  This seems like a triangle to me.  You had a no-fault policy.  You were concerned about the involvement of the stakeholders, the parents, the teachers, the mental health team, and I think you were saying something about consensus and about decision-making by consensus--
Speaker 2: Right (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) so, we can either stop there or you can realign that.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mentioned that problem-solving, the focus was on solving the problem rather than blaming, so no-fault.  Now I'm told by many people that that's the most powerful and important part of it, it's most difficult but it, it frees people from being defensive or angry or so on and you can really analyze the problem rather than fight with each other.  The second is consensus decision-making where you ask, what does the child need?  And every decision you make is based on what children need to grow and develop as opposed to what this powerful adult in the school wants and what this parent wants and so on.  If parents disagree, you have to help them understand the developmental implications of what they want, and generally, because they want the kids to be successful, they buy into that.  Now, also no paralysis, you can't paralyze the people who have to make the decisions and you promote collaboration, everybody working together to figure out what works for this child in this school.  Now, this framework, nine elements, so that you have the three mechanisms, the three operations that we carry out, and the three guidelines, the three guidelines really make it possible for adults who, prior to the program, didn't know each other, didn't like each other, didn't trust each other and were always fighting with each other so that the guidelines that they buy into and the mechanisms and the operations then create a good school context, a good environment in the school, social environment.  That then makes it possible for all of the children to identify with all of the adults to imitate, to internalize their attitudes, their values, their ways of doing things.  Now you remember I mentioned Mrs. Walsh, my school teacher, my first grade teacher, and when she stepped back and talked about, "We just love the Comer children," what she was describing was the development I received at home that prepared us to go to school and elicit a positive response.  What we did through this program was to help the school understand that many of the children didn't receive that at home.  Therefore, you have to understand it not as bad behavior, not as dumb behavior, but as a reflection of their under-development in certain ways and we thought about the ways, their developmental pathways, that all children must grow along in order to be able to perform.  There is the physical, including your brain development, there is the social interactive, the cycle emotional, the ethical linguistic and the intellectual cognitive and you have to grow along all those pathways, and so everybody in the school now begins to think of the behavior and think about how you help these kids grow at every incident, every problem, every good activity, every desirable thing that happens, are all ways to want to help the child or praise the child and hold up possibilities for the child that make children responsible for their own development.  And so, they're not fighting you, they're not fighting that situation, they're not even fighting each other, they're trying to succeed in that environment and you model what is necessary for them to succeed and that's the basic program.  And we started it at the building level, we eventually moved to the district level and we'd really like to see everybody in the country think child development because that's what's wrong with our educational system, that people do not think child development.
Story_ID: 210200
Speaker 1: One of your major achievements in American education and in mental health and psychiatry, is that you took this model [Comer School Development Program] from New Haven [Connecticut] and you took it nationally to the nation.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us how you moved from New Haven and how you grew this nationally and how many schools and school districts you're in at this point and how that all happened because that's a major achievement.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we've been in at least a thousand schools over the years.  You can't maintain it in a number of places for a great variety of political, economic, other reasons, but we maintained it in a number, we're in five hundred and some schools right now but right now we're really trying to work with districts as opposed to working with individual schools because what we've learned is that you can work with the school for five years, bring about great changes and you get a new superintendent or a new principal or a group of new teachers who aren't trained, is gone in five months, what it took five years to create.  And so you have to try to get the entire district, the entire community to buy into support for child development and the application of the principals to everything you're doing in the school and in the district and when you do that, you can get some very good outcomes.  This past year, four of the five districts we were working with, had just excellent gains and outstanding achievement.  One, and I mention it only because I don't know the exact achievement of the others, but one district in Asheville, North Carolina, all of the schools using our model achieved the designation of excellence or distinction.  Now distinction was 80 percent of the children, at or above grade level, and excellence was 90 percent of all the children, at or above grade level.  These are schools where nine housing, they serve nine housing projects so that the children are basically poor kids and yet these are state standards that they are meeting and at this high level.  What it means is that the kids can, you just have to put together the structures and organize and the adults in ways, and help the adults to function in ways that they can help the kids grow and these schools, in some of these schools, a hundred percent proficiency in some of the classrooms in these schools.  It also closed the gap between blacks and whites by the fifth grade.
Story_ID: 210201
Speaker 1: Going back to New Haven [Connecticut], if I can for just a minute, what were the achievement measures that you used to say, well, I think we've got this model [Comer School Development Program] fairly fine-tuned now and the model seems to be working.  What measures did you use to say, hey, this is all kind of working in New Haven?
Speaker 2: Well, it might have been the, from the academic standpoint, it might have been the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, I've forgotten which one it was, but it was one of the nationally standardized tests that we used and for eight years there was almost no movement and we couldn't figure out what, but in the meantime, the schools changed dramatically.  The, they were good places by the third year, they were excellent schools but the test scores weren't going up and we couldn't figure out what was needed.  We really realized that the staff needs time to gel to buy in fully, to understand and fully implement the program and also the, the parents and the staff working together to be supportive and involving the kids in activities, mainstream activities that excite them, give them a sense of the future.  Now that also, involving the staff in that way, also made the staff begin to see that these kids had potential and they weren't the dregs of the earth with no potential, no future and that you were just earning a living.  These were kids that you could prepare to participate in the mainstream of the society successfully and that, I think, that spirit eventually turned the staff around and helped them to work in ways and that they emphasized the academics.  You know, they weren't sure that the kids could learn either and they weren't sure they could teach the kids in ways that they could achieve at a high level and gradually they realized that they could and that the kids could and it just came together.  Now, part of that, we didn't know how to do it, it took us time to learn.  Today, I would say that it takes about a year to change the climate of the school, the average school.  It takes about three years to get academic gains but we've had schools that in one year have gotten both dramatic climate change and dramatic academic gains.  Now, I'd say about, over the years, about a third of the schools do very, very well, about a third do well, and about a third, don't do anything.
Story_ID: 210202
Speaker 1: One of the problems, and you're going to get that until all the way back to the way you select teachers, the way you train teachers and the way you support them in the field, they are helped to understand that it's not about your intelligence and your will alone, and that it doesn't take great intelligence to perform adequately, it is about your development and that when you can create an environment that supports the development of kids, they can achieve at the level of their ability and most of them have the ability to achieve at an adequate level and to behave well and to interact with other people well but you have, our teachers, through no fault of their own, are not prepared in that way.  They are not prepared to participate in a way that they are involved in creating the climate of the school.  The focus and traditional education is on curriculum, instruction and assessment and that's it.  Now, it's beginning and there are people who are beginning to understand that development is important but we were singing in the wilderness for a long time because very few people accepted that notion, and even until just very recently, I had an amusing incident.  I got an e-mail from a teacher in the Midwest, or somewhere, and she said, "Keep writing, keep talking," she says, "because I'm in a school and I'm an experienced teacher and I'm a good teacher," she says, "but I have a principal who is greatly critical," and she says, "you are a humanist, a developmentalist and there's no place in education for a developmentalist," okay.  So there are lots of people who still don't believe that development is critically important.  Development and learning, academic learning, are inextricably linked and you can't do one without the other.  It's like trying to go to the bank, get your bank vault opened with one key.  You need two keys and we're not doing that.
Story_ID: 210203
Speaker 1: So in 2004, as we sit here, how would you summarize the overall status of your Comer Process School, [Comer] Development Program today?  Where are you right now, nationally?
Speaker 2: Well, I think that many people know about our work today.  A growing number of people are beginning to agree that development needs to be emphasized but we're still a minority, that there's huge resistance to making a change.  Many people in education think it's, you know, going to take more time, it'll be more difficult and, you know, it's hard to change, and I understand that but it's got to change because the children have no future unless the adults and the institutions change.  In turn, the children, as adults, become a burden on society, they become a problem for themselves and their own families and society pays.  So it's got to change if the society is to remain economically strong, socially functioning well, and a good democracy.  So it has to change.  The place to intervene, I believe, has to be where we prepare teachers and administrators and you also have to help parents and you also have to develop community organizations that are supportive of development.
Story_ID: 210204
Speaker 1: One of the great problems that is hidden, gets missed, is that society changed very dramatically after World War II [WWII] and science and technology influenced everything in a way that broke down communities and put stress on families and in the absence of support, you know, like Ms. Johnson and all those, Ms. [Bertha] Bozeman, all those people who helped me grow, they don't have much influence in communities anymore and the music that is negative and all the children see today that they didn't see before, influence them in troublesome kinds of ways.  There's nobody there to help them.  As I said, I was a defiant little kid in my quiet way but my adult friends, neighbors and people concerned about me, helped me, even the guys who were in trouble themselves.  I remember going down in the basement one day, in a dive, you know, and they were using drugs and, before people were using drugs, and one of my deacons, church deacon's son, was down there and he saw me and, "Get out of here, what are you doing? Now, get out of here," and sent me back upstairs.  He didn't want me to end up the way he had ended up.  That doesn't exist today.  Now somebody has to provide support for desirable, mainstream behavior.  It doesn't mean that the mainstream is right, it means that the mainstream is our reality, that's where you earn a living.  That, what you have to do is gain, if the mainstream isn't functioning well, you have to gain the skills, the attitudes, the values ways of working, that allow you to participate in going there and change the mainstream, make it right, but as long as you can't function, can't earn a living, can't take care of yourself and your family, you're a part of the problem as much as whoever isn't developing the proper policy and the mainstream is a part of the policy, part of the problem.  And so, we've got to provide the kind of education that the children need that will allow them to be successful.  We're not there yet but we're very close and if we get the right kind of national leadership, we can turn the corner and we can get people to realize that children who are not performing well can, in an environment that supports their development.
Story_ID: 210205
Speaker 1: Changing the direction now a little bit, how do you feel about the way that you've lived your life?
Speaker 2: Well, I've been very, very fortunate.  I grew up at the right time, in the right place [East Chicago, Indiana], with the right parents [Maggie Nichols Comer and Hugh Comer], you know, it was the right neighborhood, it was the right school community, and it was the right period of history.  When I went to Yale [School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut], it wasn't that they had not had qualified blacks around before, it was that the timing wasn't right and so I may have been the first black faculty member because the timing was right and I had the training and preparation necessary and I had that because I had parents.  My father used to say, when we raised questions about, you know, "What's our possibility, you know?"  My father always said, "Prepare yourself, your time will come."  Now, the time could have arrived and we would not, and we could have been underprepared if we had not listened but we believed him and we prepared ourselves and so when the time arrived, we were there.  I've had that opportunity, I've been fortunate.  I've also been fortunate, you know, being able to do what you believe in, what you care about passionately, is very important.  That makes you feel good about getting up in the morning, even though what you did and what is difficult and stressful sometimes, but I've been able to pursue a question I ask about my friends and about the community and people who were successful who could have been successful, who have gone on a downhill course, I said, "What's the matter?  What happened?"  And I was able to pursue studies that allowed me to begin to understand that and to take actions that began to address that, the very question that I asked as a little boy, as a youngster and as a growing adult, asking it more and more.  I've been able to pursue it all my life and to be able to do what you believe in, is very important, and also at the same time, medicine did all the other things I hoped it would do.  It provided me with a decent living, of being able to take care of a family and being able to participate and influence the mainstream of the society.  I'm very fortunate in being able to do that.
Story_ID: 210206
Speaker 1: You have influenced the field of psychiatry, public education, mental health--all the things you've described to us--in writings, in books.  Your books have been very, very important and your most recent book is "Leave No Child Behind[: Preparing Today's Youth for Tomorrow's World,' James P. Comer, M.D.].  Would you just say a little bit about that book and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, 'Leave No Child Behind' is really an encapsulation of my thirty-five years of work and I describe that work but I put it into the, the context of today where, and I don't attack the Leave--No Child Left Behind [(NCLB) Act of 2001]; legislation, I make the point that, that legislation is probably the first time in history that some, the law says, you've got to educate all the children.  We expect you to be able to educate all the children.  That's a good thing.  The testing done properly, that's the problem.  It's not being done properly but testing done properly, or assessment of some kind, is a good thing.  The problem is that it doesn't call for the kind of preparation of staff and the, a new conceptualization of what it is children need to be able to learn and that is what my work has been about all this thirty-five years.  That's what it needs and that's the point of the book and that book grows out of the spirit of no child left behind, started by Children's Defense Fund.  I was a part of that group that came up with that concept and [HistoryMaker] Marian Wright Edelman took a group of us to Italy and Barbara Sobol [ph.], that came out of her mouth, as we were all searching for something to, to describe what it was we thought was needed to make it possible for all children to be successful, searching for a slogan and it's from there that the "No Child Left Behind," the "Leave No Child Behind" really came.  And so, it's "Leave No Child Behind" and what do we do?  What must we do to leave no child behind as opposed to simply testing children and punishing people for not educating the children?  You know, one of the things we learned when we went into the school, we heard all these things about unions and about teachers don't care and about parents don't care and the custodian doesn't care, and everybody in the school cared.  Everybody wanted it to be successful.  They simply didn't know what to do and they were trapped in a structure that didn't allow them to do what was necessary.  What we did was to provide the conceptual understanding and to provide a framework that allowed them to create the conditions that enabled them to act in a way that supported the development of children and we got good outcomes.  That's what needs to happen across the country and it needs to happen so that every school, every place can, can help children grow so that they can learn.  You know, it is not fair, it is not right, to create little settings here, little settings there, where some of the children can learn.  We just cream a few, keep creaming a few and leaving whole bunches of kids behind, bright able kids, some of them very reactive who are going to be problems down the line if you don't make it possible for them to participate in the mainstream of the society.  Given a choice, they would be constructive citizens.  Not given a choice, they will be destructive citizens and we all end up paying for it.  And so, my book, and what I talk about in development, 'Leave No Child Behind,' is really about how we provide the structure, the framework, at every level, that will enable the children to be successful, and schools to be successful, children to be successful, parents to be successful, everybody to be successful.  Schools of education or wherever we prepare teachers, can play a very important role but they have to change first in order, or they have to be changed in order for them to play that role and they have to begin to think development and help all teachers, every parent, place, and all administrators, think and understand development so that they can integrate curriculum instruction, assessment, into the developmental concepts.
Story_ID: 210207
Speaker 1: We cannot leave this discussion without having you comment, briefly, on one of your earlier books, 'Maggie's American Dream[: The Life and Times of a Black Family,' James P. Comer, M.D.].  Would you just say a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Well that's my favorite book--
Speaker 1: I thought so.
Speaker 2: --although I like my new book ['Leave No Child Behind: Preparing Today's Youth for Tomorrow's World,' James P. Comer, M.D.], also, but 'Maggie's American Dream' really, you know, the first part of it is an oral history of my mother [Maggie Nichols Comer] and I interview her.  And it's in that book, there's one interesting place, and one interesting incident.  You know, my mother barely reads and so later on I was asking her about the book, how she felt about it and she described how she felt better after her friends liked it--
Story_ID: 210208
Speaker 1: --About your mother's [Maggie Nichols Comer] reaction to the book ['Maggie's American Dream: The Life and Times of a Black Family,' James P. Comer, M.D.].
Speaker 2: Yeah, but it was something about, it was, what was it, the point? Oh, there was a place in the book where I was talking to her about her childrearing, you know, and she, she began to say these things, you know, I've written the booked called, 'Raising Black Children[: Two Leading Psychiatrists Confront the Educational, Social, and Emotional Problems Facing Black Children,' James P. Comer, M.D. and Alvin F. Poussaint, M.D.] with [HistoryMaker Dr.] Alvin Poussaint and we were and, it sounds like she was reading from my book, you know.  And I said, "Did you read it?"  And then I realized that I had read her book.  That in fact, much of my understanding of child development and what children need to succeed grew right out of the training and preparation that we received at home.  Now it got polished and elaborated and saw by my own training in child psychiatry and public health and the like, but the basic understanding came from what she had to say.  At one point in the book, she said, she said, you know, we, talking about she and my dad [Hugh Comer], she said, "We were able to chastise you guys when you didn't do the right thing because we had good times with you and the good times and good things we did with you made it possible for us to chastise you and you knew that the chastise was in your own good."  Well I thought about that many times.  That's basically it.  You don't need to say more about childrearing, that's it.  It is that relationship with caring parents provide good times for children, help them grow and at the same time, hold them responsible for irresponsible behaviors that that's what enables children to grow and be successful.  That's what has to happen at home, in the community and in schools and you can prevent many, many social problems if you do that and you can make it possible for many kids to succeed.  So that, that first part is the oral history.  The second part is my, is the really kind of a, my own personal experience in trying to make it, using again, what I received at home and the third part is what I did in schools.  And I took, really, what I learned from my own experience, what I gained from my profession and used in the schools and that book gets it.
Story_ID: 210209
Speaker 1: Select just one more of your favorite books, out of the number that you've written, and tell us a little briefly about that book.
Speaker 2: Well, one of my favorites is 'Waiting for a Miracle[: Why Schools Can't Solve Our Problems--and How We Can,' James P. Comer, M.D.] which is my least well-known book and least well-received.  It is, and yet, people I respect very much, liked that book very much.  I think the problem with 'Waiting for a Miracle' was that I said many a things that I've said in this book but I said them in a way that societal responsibility received great attention and we really, as a society, don't want to take responsibility for the under-development of any group of children, minority children in particular, and so we don't want to talk about it and we try to ignore it and that's too bad because we could learn a lot from understanding slavery, understanding the effects of exclusion from the mainstream of the society, understanding what happened that led the economic changes that, that were problematic because we didn't prepare large segments of the society to participate in the mainstream and I guess in that book, it was so head on, straightforward, that people didn't want to hear it, but when you develop it and make those same points in the context of what it need, what we need to educate all of the children, then the emphasis isn't so much on the, how the system works but you still see how the system works.  That, that's what I did in that book.  And I pointed out, and went into detail, showing how the black experience is very different from every other group in the country and it is for that reason and the failure to address certain problems, that we have the problems that we have today, race problems and social problems, general social problems.  We need to learn from it because we can't afford to keep losing so many kids.  We need to develop the capacity to talk about race and race problems without blaming people and understanding what happened and how we can overcome that problem and those problems.
Story_ID: 210210
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [James] Comer, how do you want to be remembered?
Speaker 2: He tried (laughter).  I, you know, I have always worked because I'm concerned and worked because things could be better and I don't worry about being remembered, actually.  You know, that question reminds me of something and something from my childhood.  And one of those three friends that went on a downhill course came to see me when I went off to college [Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana] and, you know, he stood on the outside of the screen and I was on the inside as we were leaving, and in my, as we left, I kind of knew that was the last time we were going to be seeing each other and he knew it also.  And he was one of the tough kids and as we left, there was a little tear coming down the side of his eye, you know.  It stuck with me for life.  We were like the caboose of the train, many people won't know the caboose because they don't exist anymore, I don't think, but you could stand on the platform at the end of the train, and it's like I was on this train on the caboose and he was on this train on the caboose and they were going like that, you know.  He knew it, I knew it and it was the breaking of a lifelong friendship and, that caused the tear.  Now immediately I didn't think much more of it but over time I really came to realize that we lost a kid that we didn't have to lose as a society.  We lose many kids and it's, to make a difference for those kids, was what was important to me but in so doing, I am being gratified, I am gratified, and so that's all I need, that's all I want, is the gratification of having made a difference for a lot of kids.
Story_ID: 210211
Speaker 1: Putting it another way, perhaps, what do you want your legacy to be?
Speaker 2: Well, a major thing is that I would like to be involved in helping my profession [child psychiatry] and many people think differently about children and that's been my goal for a long time, once I realized that that was the underlying problem for many children who were being left behind, was to get people to think differently and if I can do that, that I will have achieved and that would be the legacy.

Speaker 2: That's with, a picture with MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts], the president of MIT, and Bill Cosby.  Bill has supported our work.  He gave the twenty-fifth anniversary talk, or served as a master of ceremonies for that.  Been very interested and as we now know, very, very interested in problems of children who were closed out of the mainstream of the society.  It's interesting here that he was making the point that the mainstream institutions had to do more to help such children and that was the discussion we were having at MIT.  I noticed he's come under attack for blaming the victim, but he does more than that.  He has, he points not only to what the oppressed can do for themselves but he's talked what the institutions can do to help the children and families that are being closed out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One part of the training activities of our program [Comer School Development Program] is something called, the [Comer] Kids [Leadership] Academy.  We train young people to become leaders in their schools and we have children from all over the country.  About ninety come in the summer with chaperones during the Principals' Academy so they're with their principals and parents and the like.  And this year, we had, this year, 2004, we had thirty children from Dublin, Ireland who come from difficult family, community conditions, and they heard about our work and their government arranged for them to come and participate in our work and we may be working with them back in Ireland, and we have five different school districts within the United States that are involved as well.
