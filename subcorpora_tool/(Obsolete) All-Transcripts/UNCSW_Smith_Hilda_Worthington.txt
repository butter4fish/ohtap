 Marion Roydhouse: When you first were thinking of the school, in the beginning in 1921, and when you wrote the statement of purpose, it seems at one point that one of the aims was for help in the coming social reconstruction. Hilda Smith: Well, in the first place I did not found that school. That was founded by President Thomas. (It describes it in that yellow pamphlet.) She was abroad in 1920.  She went to England, and she found in England there were workers' schools in every university. And so she got the idea. She proposed this.  I was Dean of the college at the time, and I was called in just with some other people to talk about it. But she was the founder of the school. And I think that that statement of purpose was sort of a joint effort we worked out. I don't think I really composed it. It came out of a group conference with some of the trade union women that President Thomas had the sense to call in, at the very beginning. And I think I tell in that book about those early meetings, where the trade union women who were there helped us in planning the course list, and advised us as to what kind of thing we should teach. But they had no ideas on recreation; they said we never had time to play. And also at that point, as this chapter brings out, they were the ones that suggested the course in the appreciation of music; that was their idea. So it was a joint effort, and that statement of purpose also came out of that conference with the trade union women. MR: When you were thinking about the social reconstruction, was that because of the World War? Smith: I think that's rather an old-fashioned term, social reconstruction. You can call it whatever you like, bringing about necessary changes, not only in industry but in community programs. The fact is that a great many things are needed, and these schools at least tried to reach a group of women who 2 had very limited formal education and yet a great desire to learn. And from what we found out afterwards, of course, all over the countryas I bring out in that chapter, I thinkthey were taking an active part in whatever was going on in their own communities. They felt terribly responsible and wanted to reach other workers. So they were the ones that organized local classes. They were the ones that caught the interest of other colleges when they went home, and kept talking about it until things began to happen all over the country. So social reconstruction, I think, is a very bad term, and I don't think we probably use it now; it's a little bit out of date. What, would you call it? MR Well, I wondered if that's what you meant. You meant that it was to help in changing what was wrong. Smith* Yes, and you know at that time this was a recent thing and quite shocking, I'd say. At our local 181 of the Teacher's Union-I was one of the early memberstwo years ago a group of the head university directors of workers' education (about 25 of them) were there. And they gave me quite a shock because they actually brought up this question: should controversial subjects be discussed in workers' education? Well, my goodness! And they call themselves directors of workers' education. I just wondered how they thought/workers' class was going to start or go on without immediately getting into controversial subjects. But at the time of this school, I remember, we had a long discussions should we dare use the term "social action" as one of the purposes of the school? Those were dirty words, they really were. Everyone was very suspicious when you said "social action." Very upsetting, you know, to think things were going to be changed. Well, I don't know whether that's answered your question. 3 MR: I was just watching television the other night, and they were having another actors' project in Hollywood. And that was something that they said they were going to make sure, that none of the drama that they were going to put  on was going to be political. Smith: /laughter/ Well the controversies, you know, are not only in the political field. They're in the labor field, they're in the community field, they're everywhere all over the place. And how they thought they were going to conduct workers' classes and avoid these controversies /laughter/ I was fascinated, I asked for a chance to speak to that subject. And later we broke up into small groups for the afternoon workshops of this Teachers' Union. And the director of the afternoon session just put a lot of big cardboard pieces on the floor, all labeled with what they were about. So I picked up the one on controversial subjects. And we had a long discussion that afternoon; and of course everyone agreed that these university professors were back in the kindergarten stage if they really meant thatbut apparently some of them did, MR: When your group started talking about it then, what do you think was their aim as far as workers' education was concerned? Did you think they had any clear idea of what ought to be workers' education? Smith: In local 181? MR; No, back when you thought about the Bryn Mawr School. Smith: No, as I've said in this, the one person that knew what this was all about was Ernestine Friedmann, and we brought her in. She was in the Y.W., and that was a very progressive organization, and still is. She had been in charge of a program at the Colgate factory, soap and perfumes factory in Jersey City, and she had several years there working with those industrial workers. She knew 4 very well what we were getting into by saying this was going to be a workers' school. The President didn't know. I didn't know, although I had a vague idea because I'd worked with industrial workers in New York for several years. So I knew what they were thinking about, but I did not really understand the implications of a labor school closely related to the organized labor movement. I didn't put it in thisI wish I hadbut the thing that happened when that school first opened was a violently suspicious group of students. We had several conferences of labor leaders the first year; they all advised those students not to trust the college. They said this was only capitalistic propaganda, don't trust Bryn Mawr College. They came in through Rockefeller Hall; their first question was: "Does Mr. Rockefeller own this school?" The only thing that really caused a place where we could go ahead with the conferences with students was the fact that they brought in a resolution that first year that one half of the Board of Control should be labor people. We had a meeting in the Board and, as I said, President Thomas had5 had the sense to bring in some of the Trade Union leaders in that first meeting. But they weren't fifty-fifty by any means, there were just two or three of them on that Board. Then this came up, and those of us who had lived through that first summer knew perfectly well that unless this resolution from the students passed there wouldn't be any school the next year--they would not have gone back and recruited for it. They had been taught by these labor leaders not to trust the college. So it was a very dramatic meeting. At first the Presidentand of course they all had great respect for President Thomas because they knew that she had really had the idea of the school, and they felt very appreciative of the fact there was a school of this kind. ... And as I've the said in there, I think, in 1916/Women's Trade Union League had brought in a resolution that the women's colleges should open for industrial workers. Nothing 5 happened until Bryn Mawr really did it. And Miss Thomas had never even heard of that resolution when she suggested this. She was basing her suggestion on the British movement. So this was a very tense meeting. And Miss Thomas got upshe was a very dynamic person and very sure of herselfand she said: "Well, this is an educational adventure, and I think the educators should always be in the majority on the Board of Control." Well, those of us who had lived through this summer knew that was the end of the school. There wouldn't be any school; they wouldn't go back and recruit for it. Then we stopped for lunch and something very dramatic happened. Miss Thomas happened to sit next to Sadie Dresner, who was a laundry worker from Baltimoreno, she was a member of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers from Baltimore. They evidently had a talk at lunch. We got back into the meeting and Miss Thomas got up in a very dramatic way and said; "I've changed my mind. I've talked with Miss Dresner, and I see that what the workers want is not propaganda. They want straight education, and I'm willing to have them come on the Board in equal numbers with the college group." This happened immediately. And from then on it was fifty-fifty. And everything I've had anything to with in other universities with new schools starting, I've made this same recommendation; fifty-fifty, college and labor. And it works. And what really happened was that the group never split off into those two sections, Any question that came up there were usually some college people and some labor people standing for the same thing, and some college people and some labor people opposing it. But it never broke down into those two groups for a controversy. You got this feeling of cross-sections. But it worked, and it saved the school; actually, nobody realized it was being saved at that moment, but I did! And so did everybody who'd been there for that summer, because the students were so suspicious. And they were not prepared to fight Miss Thomas on it, ultimately, 6 because they appreciated what she'd done. So that was a turning point; that was a crucial meeting. MR: When the students came in and they were suspicious of the staff, what do you think made them get out of that suspicion? Smith; Well, my chapter will tell you, I think. One thing that made them get over it, I think, was the fact that they knew everything about the school. They knew where the money came from. At first they were suspicious of that; they talked about "tainted money." And we had a long discussion of "Where did the money come from?" We finally concluded that it was more important to know where it went then where it came from, because if you come down even now, you know, to tainted money all money is tainted with something where it comes from. But it's much more important to know where it's going and how it's being used. So they got around that hurdle. And then, of course, the thing that surprised me was their extreme timidity about doing anything on their own those first weeks, because they had been working under foremen and employersusually pretty hardcoreand they didn't dare take any initiative. I told it in here some of the things they asked me: could they go to another building after dark without someone going with them? And some Russian-Jewish girl I met in the hall said: "Miss Smith, have I your permission to take a little wash?" They didn't dare do anything. They were scared. They were terrified of the dark campus at first. They'd never slept in rooms with less than four or five people in a room, and finding themselves in a single room was terrifying. Well I've put in all these episodes. So that the way they were reassured was by getting acquainted. I remember one girl who the first week went to bed when the sun went down and put her head under the blankets. And the only reason that she came out of her little cocoon was the fact that she got interested in the stars 7 and the telescope, and the science teacher told her that she could have a look at Jupiter through the telescope. So finally she came out. But she had never slept in a room by herself before, she'd never been on a dark campdsshe'd come from a light town. It took quite a long time for them to get reassured and find out they were free to do these things. MR: In the Southern Summer School they say that they were never concerned with workers' education just for women, but just that that was easier. For example, do you think that from the beginning they taught   that women needed a separate kind of workers' education? Smith: Well, the women's colleges weren't prepared to take men, actually. They didn't have the facilities for men. They would have had to open new buildings for men. That was one reason we moved the school in 1939, because the men wanted to come in. And by that time we had this little school up on the Hudson at my home, Vineyard Shore, where we had just women for those four years until we ran into a financial crisis and we had to close it. But we left Bryn Mawr for two reasons. A new president was coming in, and the general feeling in the Bryn Mawr group was that it wasn't quite fair to ask a new president to take on the whole college and then take on a problem workers' school along with it. And the other reason was that men wanted to come in. And I tell in that about the early days of the Depression when we had visitors to the students, men and women. They were hungry and we weren't prepared to feed hungry people who came to visit their relatives in the school. Once I quoted the fact that a brother came to see a sister. He'd come up from the South looking for work, and he was planning to spend the night in the railroad station. These hungry, homeless men were a real problem as we got into the Depression. And I rashly fixed him up in the guest room for the night, which was very much opposed to the house- 8 keeper's idea. She said* "You know, we can't run a home for homeless men." And I agreed we couldn't. But up on the Hudson where we moved we had as many as a thousand students, men and women, from May 'til October. We didn't have the money to run it in winter because of the heat, but we did run from May to October, anything from one-week courses to six weeks, men and women. Did I tell you what happened one day that Mrs. Roosevelt invited us over for a picnic? Did I tell you about the simple cotton dresses? MR* No. Smith; Well, the night before I was up there. Of course, I was working in Washington, but we had an office in New York at that time. I used to go up to the school for weekends. At supper that night somebody said to the director; "What shall we wear to Mrs. Roosevelt's picnic tomorrow?" And the director said: "Oh, just simple cotton dresses." So the next morning at breakfast the whole school, including twenty-five men, came down in simple cotton dresses, which they'd borrowed from the girls. We got over to Mrs. Roosevelt's and she met us in a bathing suit /laughter/, and produced thirty bathing suits and everybody went swimming in the pool. And then she cooked lunch for us, hot dogs out in the garden. And then she spoke to the students. You know, she had very little confidence in herself, so she came to me and she said; "I wonder if those students really understood what I was talking about. I wish you'd find out if they understood." So when I got back to the school at supper we discussed her talk; and of course they understood every word. She was just a remarkable teacher, but she never thought she was. So I wrote her that of course they understood the talk and very much appreciated the day with her. But I always remember the simple cotton dresses! MR; She was at Bryn Mawr much earlier on, wasn't she? 9 Smith; Yes. Well, I met her first in Women's Trade Union League in New York, and she was very interested in the League. Those leaders of the Trade Union League were really very great friends of hers; Rose Schneiderman, Elizabeth Christman, those early leaders. And they often went up to Hyde Park to see her. Well, as you probably know, Hyde Park is just opposite our school there, so that we were within hailing distance of Hyde Park. MR* So that from the beginning it was just that there wasn't room for men. It wasn't that you thought that women needed education more than men. Smith* Well, they did at that time. They were hardly ever given any recognition in the unions. I found this later, just this last August, in Michigan. I was invited to come out and open a new school for women workers at the University of Michigan. And we had eighty-five trade union women there. Mr. and Mrs. Kornbleu were directing it. They were immediately under fire because they said* "Well, this ought to be for men and women, not just women." Well, I took the stand, and so did a great many other people, that women had a right to their own school. They had problems that were different than men's. So that the University, I think, has decided that next summer they'll have one school for women alone again, then they'll have one for men and women together. Normally that would be right, to have them together. But I still think women have some problems. You see, they hardly ever get to the top positions; you see them as secretaries of the local unions, but very, very few are ever presidents or even vice-presidents in a local union. They do all the routine work of being secretaries and keeping records, but they still are at a disadvantage. And they have some special problems, in their work, in their workshops, in their trades, that are different from the men's. MR* Did you deal with those, do you think, in the school? Did you talk 10 about them? Smith* Yes. Well, you mean, in Bryn Mawr? MR* Yes, in Bryn Mawr. Smith* Well, not directly, because these were women, and we knew they were women, and we knew what they'd come for. We had lots of men visitors; we had all their relatives, which created a problem. And when we found that, as the Depression grew worse in the later years, they were hiding their little sisters and nieces in their rooms and taking food from the dining room for them the school council finally decided to raise some money and give them very limited permission to take their guests to the dining room. Because we were on a very limited budget, and all their guests who arrived for Sundays or just passing through, of course, got hungry, and it was really very difficult. This was toward the end of the school, actually; this was thirty-two, I think, the year before I came to Washington. MR* When you were writing about Vineyard Shore, and you just said that the women wanted music, the women themselves. . . . MR* . . . and later on you talk about when you visited Sweden. . . . Smith* Yes, and there I saw this development of the arts and all kinds of artistic ventures. In Germany, too; murals, you know, done by industrial workers; volumes of poems by industrial workers. They're way ahead of us. What's happening in your country in this field? /.New Zealand/ MR; They do have workers' education programs that people go to 11 Smith: Through the universities? MR: No. They're usually connected, but they have whole staffs of their own, I'm not sure where they get the money fromit must be government money. Smith: Well, I've found that Europe was way ahead of us in this field of the workers' arts. And that lead us to start what we call the Art Workshop in New York. At Bryn Mawr that one year we had what I call a "Putter Porch." We happened to have somebody that knew how to do charcoal drawings, another person knew how to do clay work. So we just said; "Well, this is the putter porch. Come and try these things out." And then when they went back to New York there was nothing but very expensive art schools, you know. Did I tell you what happened which lead to a whole new movement up there? MR; No. Smiths Well, I was in the subway one day. I don't know if you know the name of Mary Van Kleeck, but she was right across in the subway from me. At that time she was chairman of a settlement down on the lower East side, the Rivington St. Settlement. And she shouted at me over the subway train* "What would you do with eighty thousand dollars?" And I shouted back* "Don't ask me unless you mean it." And she shouted back* "Come and see me." So I did, soon afterward. And I found that the Rivington neighborhood house had been advised by the social workers to go out of existence. All their clients, the neighborhoods there, had changed, and most of those clients of theirs, the neighbors, had moved up to the Bronx. And so they were practically left there with old buildings and no people coming to the activities in the settlement. And then I discovered that they owned a forty-acre farm up in the mountains, the Ramapo mountains, Mt. Ivy. They didn't know what to do; they didn't know what next. These were mostly elderly women. So I remembered that these girls from Bryn Mawr who felt interested in the arts had nowhere to go in New York City because all the art schools were so expensive and they mostly were in the daytime when they were working. So some of us got together and it just happened at that moment there was a former Trade Union woman, Mabel Leslie. She'd been an electrical worker and she had a family up in New York State, I think she had an uncle who offered her job in his factory. He said* "Would you rather go into the office or would you rather go into the factory?" He thought she would say* "The office." She said* "No, the factory." She went into the electrical factory and was leading a picket linethe Trade Union League came around and helped them organizeshe was leading a picket line when her uncle came along and saw her leading the picket line. Well, we got her a scholarship, as it happened, for a year of study in Europe, She'd been on the staff of the Trade Union League, and I got to know her very well at that time. So she had a year in England, and I think she went to Germany too. But anyway, in England she discovered this outburst of workers' art and she got very much interested in it. So, to go back to the Rivington St. Settlement, they decided that they would sell those buildings and we cooked up this plan for an Art Workshop in New York City in the garment workers' area, open at night and over the weekends. And we put Mabel Leslie in as the director. And she was just the person, because she not only had the background with the industry and with the labor movement, but she had become interested in the arts and was very knowledgable about what was being done in Europe. And she brought us back samples of workers' art from Europe. So then we discovered, to my disappointment, that this mythical eighty thousand dollars was all tied up in those old houses, and until the old houses were sold there was no money. But we scrambled along and we got a new board of directors and we put in Mabel as 13 director. And eventually we had two hundred women workerssome men, but mostly womenwho were interested. Then we found this forty-acre farm up in the Ramapo Mountains in New Jersey had always been used as rather a money-raising venture by the Settlement for children's fresh air work. So for two years, in order to hang onto that place and get the money that had been coming in from fresh air children, we had to run it as a fresh air farm, along with everything else. And Mabel directed this. I think she said once, very prophetically* "Do you know that there are twenty hours every day when children are not asleep?" /laughter, Miss Smith and MR/ And then we gradually turned it into an adult education art and science center. And then when Bryn Mawr evicted the summer school once, and for two years, we went up there and carried on there. That eviction: I wrote it up several times, but it was entirely a misunderstanding. MR: I did read what you wrote about it. Smith: Yes. You see, we had agreed with the Trustees of Bryn Mawr the first year that the school would not take part in demonstrations as a school. We never said individuals; they could do what they wanted. But as it happened that year there was a strike in a Cannon factory nearby, and two of the faculty went over and took a look at it. As it happened the employer had been using tear gas against the strikers. And as it happened also, one of the members of the faculty happened to know the employerhad met him in Russia on a trip (she said she'd given him Castor Oil once). Anyway, she had a connection with the employer, and she persuaded him to bring in a doctor and a nurse, because there were some pregnant women in those dormitories. And that was all that happened. BEGIN SIDE II, TAPE I MR; But actually what I was interested in was that it seemed, to me at least, a change there in the sorts of things that you began with and that you 14 were more concerned with as a whole. Smith; We learned a great deal. We learned what workers wanted and what they expected to do, and what preparations we had to make for them. I remember one Baltimore laundry worker who came to me and said; "I don't think I'm getting anything that's going to help those laundry workers in Baltimore." So we got hold of her teachers and we revised her whole course in terms of what those laundry workers could use. Now this was a process that went on all the time, and we tried to find out what they thought they could use. And of course they were so already ignorant of elementary things like the universe that it was a difficult question in teaching. And when these Trustees begged us to come back they realized that they had evicted us on a misunderstanding, and that what we were talking about was really what they wanted, but they didn't know how to express it. But fortunately they were good Quakers. They had a liberal traditionthey always haveand those good old Quaker Trustees were people that were very sympathetic, eventually. I mean, they were always sympathetic, but they were not talking in terms of what the workers were talking about at all. MR; Before the school evicted you, before 1934 or whenever it was that Bryn Mawr evicted you, you talk about the controversy that surrounded the school in your book. But could you tell me a bit more, because it's not really clear exactly what things it was that caused this   at Bryn Mawr. Smith: Yes, the neighbors. It was a wealthy community. They'd never heard of such a thing, and they began inviting the whole school to these parties. Well, we tried out one or two, and the first one was extremely elaborate, I noticed the students went in and they all shook hands with the butler because they thought he was our host. They gave us a very elaborate out-of-doors supper 15 just overwhelming. I mean it was so elaborate, so rich and so overdone that nobody felt comfortable about it, and we said goodbye and went home. So the next time we had another invitation, but this hostess went to the other extreme. She used paper plates; it was like a very poor picnic, you know, I forget what we had, but I think it was bread and sausages or something, and maybe coffee. But that didn't go down at all well after all. So we decided in the school, and the Council decided, not to accept any invitations from the neighbors unless we knew them very, very well. And the one family we did know very well was right across the street. One daughterwell, all the young peoplehad been friends of mine, and the mother of the family had been my chairman in a previous job at the community center. The father was a very liberal employer. He was way ahead of his time. He was a paper box manufacturer. I went to his factory and saw what he was doing, which was years ahead of what other employers were doing. So he used to have parties for the college, but we didn't go the rounds. And then another controversial subject was the press, reporters who immediately came around and wrote up these sob stories about the girls. Well the girls were outraged. And then we were fortunate to find a woman who had been associated with the college, but she wasn't a college graduate, Carey Collins. And we realized we needed someone to handle the papers for us. I didn't know what to do with them, and these reporters were all over the place, at first. MR: And you let them come in? Smith; Well, we had to let them come in. We'd have been in much more trouble if we'd said they couldn't come in. But their articles, I think I quote it in that book, were regular sob stories; "Wealthy college opens for poor girls" and that sort of thing. Well, Mrs. Collins had the sense to talk 16 with the newspaper people, and she recommended to me that we should line up a series of interviews with the students and back up the idea of their being interviewed. And then the publicity began to change. The reporters would come out of these interviews quite thrilled, because they had no idea that these students were speaking so seriously about what they wanted from the school. And they got away from this sob story stuff, and gave them some very good interviews. But the press was always in my mind, because I think I told about the summer school newspaper that was always a bone of contention: first, as to what it should be named. I felt I had to take the responsibility of making sure that the final issue of that little students' paper should give a true interpretation of the school. So I read it carefully before it was actually distributed in the school, because I knew there were reporters around. I knew there were critical people all over the place. I never really had to censor it, because it had a very high standard, really. The Board of Editors were five students, and two English instructors who helped them. But the thing that caused a great deal of uproar was the fact that some of those contributions were rejected, and I had all these weeping girls whose contributions were not accepted. /laughter/ I think I told the story of one of them. I suggested that she write an article for her own labor paper, and she did. MR: Well, what about trade unionism and the alumnae? How did the alumnae of Bryn Mawr feel about communists coming to the school, and socialists. Smith* Well, they always realized we had a small group of communists and we wanted them in the school, because they were very stimulating. We didn't have quite so much trouble with them in Bryn Mawr: we knew exactly who they were. You see, at that period there was nothing secret about being 17 a communist; they put it on their application blanks. And I remember one episode that showed what really happened in these crises with the communists. We had a speaker, and he was very much on the radical side. Two of the communist girls rushed up to me afterwards and said: "Oh, wasn't he wonderful? We'd like to have him for the fourth of July." Well I said: "You can't invite him and I can't invite him. This has to go through the Council." They rushed back to the speaker (I saw them doing this in the crowd), and then they rushed back to me again and said: "He can come. He can come." I said: "You can't invite him. You'll have to consult the Council." So they looked wildly around and said: "There are two girls from the Council here; let's ask them." I said* "%. You have to give notice of the agenda for the Council. There has to be a quorum. You have to give them a week's notice that this subject is coming up." daughter/ Well, they were quite taken aback, but they had to go through this routine. And when they got to the Council and they were given a hearing, the Council members said: "Well, of course this was all decided way back in June. We have our speakers." And that was that. And then at the Vineyard Shore school we had several very active communists. The minute that school was organized and the girls elected their own board, these two girls resigned. They said: "We are not members of this school; we are members of the communist party." And all the rest of them resigned; they all walked out. /laughter/ This was over a weekend, and they came to me and told me what had happened. Well, I knew what had happened. And they asked if I would call a meeting of the whole school and talk to them about this. So we had a long, very tedious meeting. The communist girls said: "We're not members of this school; we're members 18 of the communist party." And then the others said: "Well, then you shouldn't be here." This went on for two hours. Well, finally they voted to have another election, because there wasn' t any board by that time, they'd all resigned, /laughter/ So they had another election, and this time the same girls were elected. This time they served, and they did a very good job of taking their part in the school government. But this was the process we had to go through. And then every little episode. . . . I know at Bryn Mawr the faculty wanted after-dinner coffee. Well, they couldn't serve after-dinner coffee to the faculty without serving it to the whole school. /laughter/ So, another meeting on that. And then the undergraduates who were in charge of the swimming pool got a bright idea. And after the swimming pool was closed at 10*00 at night or half past ten they all wanted to go swimming, which the students were not allowed to do. That was another crisis. And the students were outraged that here was a special favored group that went swimming at 11:00 at night /laughter/ and nobody else could go. We lived through these, but the only reason we lived through them was the students had full understanding of everything about the school, including of course the finances. They'd come by that time to care so much for it that they were not willing to do anything so violent that the school would have been closed up. But they knew they were free to do it. And, as I think I've said in this chapter, I officiallyI mean by the first agreement with the collegehad the right to hold up action until I could consult the Board of Directors. But the Board of Directors, by that time, were fifty percent labor people and representatives of the students. Well, in the thirteen years I directed that school I never felt it was necessary 19 to suspend action to consult the Board of Control, because usually with a very free discussion and a long, tempestuous meeting the whole school voted for some rather moderate action which would not endanger the school. But they knew they were free to take extreme action if they thought the issue merited it. MR* I wanted to ask about southern women at Bryn Mawr in particular. From   book it tells that the southern women had a lot of problems when they came to the school. First of all, did you have trouble recruiting women in the South? Smith: Well, I don't know. I read something recently . . . oh, I know, it was Esther Peterson' s talk at the Women Workers' Week. She quoted the year we opened for Negroes, The southern white girls got rumors of this, and they almost boycotted the school. They would have been accepted, but at the last minute they found out that there would be Negroes in the school that year, and they almost withdrew their applications. But they finally got upand I'll give you this thing by Esther Peterson which describes this incidentand they did decide to come, and finally got acquainted. And Esther mentions the fact she saw a black and a white student walking together across the campus, finally, But I got into trouble once when we opened for the Negro students. Jca, And that was several years afterward, because at first nobody even suggested it. There were no black students in the college, and all our alumnae who were recruiting were recruiting white students. And by that time the Southern School had started, and they were recruiting white students. So, but at this point . . . what did happen? Anyway, an Italian girl came to me and said* "Our Negro students are very upset," And I looked out 20 of the window and I saw this little group, about seven of them, on the campus. And I went out, and I found they were upset. It was partly my fault too, because I had thought at first as they were coming into a new situationthey didn't know the school, we didn't know themI thought they'd feel more comfortable to be in a corridor by themselves perhaps, the seven of them. And this was what upset them, because they said: "Well, we were told at home and we were told in the Y.W. that we'd come up here in order to make friends. And how are we ever going to do it if we're off in this separate corridor?" Well, I got their point, and before anybody knew what was happening I distributed them all over the school. I found roommates for them, mostly with the Russian immigrant girls. They were willing to room with them, because the white girls were not. But they adjusted themselves to that situation that was from a very bad start, because I didn't realize that this would isolate them, I thought it would make them feel comfortable to be by themselves. MR: Were there any blacks from the South? It says in the book that they were mostly recruited from the North. Is that true? Smith* Mostly, yes. Well, the Southern Summer School was starting at Sweetbriar for the students there. They had black students, eventually, from the South. I don't remember that we had a black student from the South, but I do remember. . . , Have you seen that little book of poems that the students wrote? MR* Yes. Smith: Well, there' s one thereit was written by a white girlabout this subject. I've got it right here; I saw it yesterday. This really gives their attitude. This is by Ruth Collins, as I remember, who was a southern 21 white girl. "Prayer," by Ruth Collins, I think that's the one. MR: Yes, I saw that. You don't remember who Ruth Collins was? Smith: She was a southern white girl, I know. MR: Oh, that's good. What about when you first went down South to get girls to go to the school? Did you encounter any more opposition getting women to come to the school in the South than anywhere else? Smith: Well, by that time we could direct them to the Southern Summer School if they were interested. Oh we had some girls with very tragic backgrounds. I remember Laura Ketchie from Georgia. She had a terrible experience at home and in the factories, Well, I remember one thing a little bit later which had its roots in this early period. When we had classes in the Depression when the government program was on I was on Harry Hopkins's staff. The southern workers, men especially, said: "Lady, you don't know what you're asking. If we come to your classes we'11 lose our job the next day." Which was true. And I happened to be out in Denver the day after the Supreme Court confirmed the National Labor Relations Act recognizing the unions. Did I tell you what happened that night in Denver? Very dramatic. All the union offices were kept open all night printing union contracts, and the employers were sending for union organizers to come and organize their shops, to get back in a period where they could produce without all these controversies. And at breakfast the next morning the waitresses all came in with union buttons and wouldn't take any tips. Well, after that gradually the workers felt they could go to those classes in the South, and they did not lose their jobs. But this was a long, long struggle. And one of our former students, Elizabeth Nord, I remember very well, 22 was employed for a while by the Women's Trade Union League, and they sent her down to Virginia to organize. And she told me this story. She was a silk weaver from Providence, Rhode Island. She said her mother was a weaver and her brother was a weaver. She said* "You know, it takes just as long to be a weaver as it does to be a lawyer, and that's nine years." Her mother taught her to weave; she taught her brother to weave. And then she was in the school. She was a very quiet little person; a very good mind, but she didn't stand out at all. When she applied for a second year we didn't take her, because we didn't feel that she had done any more than just passively accept everything, you know. But she went back, and Mr. Green was president of the A.F. of L, thenthis was before the merger with the C.I.O. He used her to speak about workers' education, and was so impressed with her that he , . . what did he do? Oh, he published her talk on the Bryn Mawr School in The Federationist, the magazine of the labor movement, and she became quite well known as a speaker on workers' education. Then she applied for a second year and we took her back daughter/ that next year, and she's been one of the most remarkable people, , . . Well, on this trip into Virginia she found that she was being followed. She was driving her own car, and she was being followed by two really thugs, employer's spies, all over the state. So she was on a country road once and she stopped. She went back and talked to these two men in this following car. And she knew very well that they were tracking her down. She said: "You know, you don't have to follow me around the state. Here's my schedule; this is where I will be all week, /laughter/ You can find me in these places." But even then they escorted her out of the state and saw her over the border before they left her. So this was quite typical of that time. 2) MR: The women of the South, did they have less education than the people from the other areas at Bryn Mawr in the early years, like before they went to the Southern School? Smith: Did they have less education? MR: Yes. Did they have more problems with the classes than anyone else? Smith: Yes, they did. Well, I remember several of them very well. I have written up the story of this Southern Summer School and Louise Leonard. I was going to get it published. And this is what I told you before, that the Southern Educational Conference asked me to write something. They gave me the title: "Workers' Education in the Souths Then and Now." Well, the then was very easy because we'd all lived through it. But when I came to the now, as you know, I was stuck. And this is where I met Dr. Scott for the first time. But in that earlier period, the girls from the South who came to Bryn Mawr had very little education. I rememberwho was itBessie Frith. She was showing the school what she didand I wrote that up, I thinkusing a little machine and tying threads on the loom. She was in a spinning factory. This was what she did. And even then, when she came to the school she was working eleven hours a day; and this was all her job, walking up and down and moving her thumb to tie the knots on the spinning frames. And, I remember, she had had fourth grade education only. And then there was Ollie McDonald, who was really a remarkable girl. She was from Tennessee, She was very, very ignorant; she was a mountain white girl. She had her first shoes when she went down to the factory when she was eleven years old. And she was a product of child labor. But she got fascinated with the science courses in the school.  I remember she came in one day to my office with a huge armload of leaves that she'd picked, and was thrilled to pick these. And then she was a real fundamentalist. She got a terrible shock with the study of evolution in the school. That really did shock her. She' d been brought up in a Baptist church, you know, and evolution was a terrible thought. I think she was the one that said: "If the earth is codling off, as you say, what's going to become of hell's fire?" /laughter/ Well, did I tell you what happened to her afterwards? Well, somebody, I don't know how, at Antioch offered us a scholarship. She was free to go on, she said; she had a mother down in the South and a big family, but she was on her own. I had corresponded with Antioch about a number of girls, and thinking of Ollieshe was such an interesting personality, and so keen about her classes and so absolutely ignorant, that I thought she ought to go into the House School at Antioch. Well they made a mistake and they registered her as a freshman, if you pleaseway beyond what she was ready for. And then I began to get letters from her, and this went on for two years. Her first letter said: "Will you please send me a book on etiquette. All I can find is something on balls, banquets and weddings."But," she said, "I want a book that will tell me how to get through a plain dinner of meat, potatoes, beans and dessert without a mistake." Well, I excerpted some books on etiquette for her and put them in simple terms and told her what to do at dinner. She really was quite a sensation at Antioch. She went to a football game, and she saw the whole crowd getting up and cheering for the football team, and she sat still. They asked her:  "What's the matter? You're not up; you don't show the proper school spirit." And she said: "Well if 25 this is the proper college spirit, I'm glad I don't show it." She said: "All the money goes for the football team, but I'll tell you the weaker men need the exercise twice as much." /laughter/ And then she went to the president (she always went to headquarters); she walked up to the president's house and told him that she wanted a course that would tell her why she was what she was, where she'd come from and where she was going. And she wrote to me: "I think he's going to let me take that course." /laughter/ Well, I don't know what she got into. Then her next letter said: "What do you think of being engaged in college?" Before I could even answer it she wrote and said: "I am engaged." Then she said: "What would you think of being married in college?" And again, before I could answer she said: "I am married." And she'd met a graduate student, if you please, and they were married. And, of course, the college dismissed her; they didn't keep married students. So she and her husband were on their own. And he got a job ._. .  /Her husband died quite soon after and left her with a small boy to support/ BEGIN SIDE III, TAPE II Well, then this little boy grew up, and I still was in touch with him by telephone. He joined the police force. He'd been in the Army, but he had a dishonorable discharge because he took two days off to go and see a girl. No, I guess it was the Navy. And up in the Hudson valley I knew a family of whom the man had been an officer in the Navy, I appealed to him. I gave him the story of this boy and his mother and the whole background of the family, I don't know what he did, but he cleared the boy. He said he was so young and he just went off to see a girl without getting permission to be absent, you know. And so he is now, as far as I know, on the police force in Los Angeles. And his mother, our former student, had a lot of illnesses for a while, but 26 sheshe' s of course a middle-aged widow by nowhas become interested and has had training in occupational therapy. And as far as I knowI haven't heard from her recently, but I still hear from her. ... She was one of the southerners who. . . . MR: She left the South, though. Smith: Yes, she left the South. But she kept saying to the people at Antioch: "Well, I know a lot of workers down in Tennessee that would make a lot better use of this college course than some of the freshmen I see around." /laughter/ Well, I published her letters. I got her permission to publish them, and they were published in that old magazine The Survey years ago. And they really were fascinating letters. Well, I don't know. I haven't heard from her recently, but I think she's still in California. No, the southern girls on the whole had had less education. And when it came to the science courses they had, really, shocks, because they had been brought up in this very fundamentalist type of religion. So evolution just upset them. MR: Did they all go to church still when they all went to the Summer School? Smith: Well now,                                                                                    on that subject. What we found was that people always said: "Well, what do you do about religious observances?" Well, I explained that in that school we did not have any formal religious observances; people were free to go where they wanted. The Russian Jewish girls preferred at first to go to the Friends Meeting, and they seemed to like it. They went back there quite often. With the Roman Catholic girls we had to get them, of course, out to Mass. And then the Southern Baptists and fundamentalists usually wanted immediate help in 27 finding a Sunday school, because a lot of them had twenty years' records of never missing a day in Sunday school, and so unless we produced a Sunday school for them the first Sunday they were at Bryn Mawr they were very much distressed. So we decided that everybody should be free to do whatever they wanted for the services, but the school did not have religious services as such. We thought the whole purpose of the school was really a long-range spiritual purpose of education and social change. I remember the Catholic girls once. They were so upset by evolution that I took several of them out to Villanove College, which is a Catholic college, and asked for an interview with some of the nuns. The nuns talked very straight to them. They said:  "You are here to learn. Keep an open mind. Don't shut your minds. You are here to learn." And that really did help them. It helped me, because they were awfully upset when they got into the science courses. MR: The Southern Summer School, when they started. . . . From what I can gather from these papers they never really affiliated. Smith: No, they never did. Louise Leonard and I _        We went around trying to raise money for both schools.  I never /they did not affiliate/ knew really why. J . . They never said: "We won't be affiliated," but they never did affiliate. We had perfectly friendly relations with them. MR: You did? Smith: Oh yes, we always did. The staff they employed, several of them had been on the staff at the Bryn Mawr Summer School, and so we had constant relationships with them whenever it came to the South. I'11 find my article on the Southern Summer School, if you'd like, and what Louise Leonard did. MR: From their papers it seemed that one thing they objected to was to 28 having to have college women. Because right from the beginning they had had more . . . Smith: More labor . . . MR; . . , more union, more labor people, Smith: Well, their relation with Sweet Briar, which organized that school, was quite different from our relation with Bryn Mawr, Sweet Briar lent them the buildings; Bryn Mawr helped to run and control the school. The basis was quite different. But then, you know, they moved around. They were in North Carolina; they borrowed a Baptist school. Then they moved again. I thought that was a very good idea, because they reached different groups without too much traveling. They moved the school to where the workers were. And they did a very good job. We had no friction, no controversy; they just didn't affiliate. When they said they weren't going to, we just let it go at that.  I think they were stoic, MR: I wonder. Do you think because they didn't belong, because they didn't have the help of a college alumnae that it made their job more difficult? Smith: No, because the Bryn Mawr committees were all through the South too, and they became joint committees with the Southern Summer School, So it was all perfectly friendly and normal, but we never got over this hump of affiliation. I don't know who advised them; I think maybe some of the southern labor leaders who warned them not to do it, you know. It didn't really make much difference, except I think they lost out by not having the broader association with the other schools. But as I said, Louise Leonard and I were old friends, and we often went off on joint finance visits in New York and divided up the money. MR: Louise Leonard, from the papers, seems to have thought the work of education was more important to educate workers for action rather than have things like music or creative drama. Smith: Well, she went on the same plan, I think, of trying to find out what those workers wanted. And I don't doubt they had just as much. I remember they put on some very good plays. I would say that the objectives were practically the same. The methods were slightly different, but not very much, because it was a very easy interchange with them always. But yes, I didn't think you' re right. I think they/go into the arts as much as we did, and we only did it when the request came from the students. Their pattern was pretty much the same, except I thought it was pretty difficult every couple of years to move to another state or another place, and they had to start all over again with that community, you see. But they had good leadership and they had very good teacherssome of them from Bryn Mawr. /laughter/ So there wasn't any friction at all. MR* Mrs. Dexter Otey, Elizabeth Otey; she was a northerner, wasn't she? Smith: She was a southerner. And we appointed her when the college evicted us. We borrowed that farm up in the mountains and Mrs. Otey was-the director then for two years. She was an older Bryn Mawr woman, but she was a southerner from Virginia, MR: She went to Bryn Mawr, then, as a student. Smith: Yes, she did. She was older than I was. So she directed the school for two years while it was up there, before the Trustees begged us to come back /laughter/. MR: What was she like as a person? Smith: A lovely person. Quite conservative, and a very good teacher. 50 She was one of our tutors at first in Bryn Mawr, But a very fine teacher; she taught English, as I remember. And her daughter worked with me later  the whole family was interested. But she represented the older alumnae of Bryn Mawr. I got up there once the two years the school was up there; I visited it once when she was director, I remember. And I thought she did an excellent job; the students all liked her very much. She was very friendly . . . and very southern. /laughter/ MR: Very southern. You said she was conservative; do you think that she approved                        of the trade unions in the South? Smith: Oh yes, she was a very strong trade unionist. She was very divided about relations with the colored people. She tried to overcome this typical southern attitude, and she never discriminated against them, but I don't think she enjoyed them. /laughter/ She had an apartment in the same house with my aunt and me for a couple of years; this was after she ran the school up at  . Ivy. She was a lovely neighbor. She was just delightful. She was a wonderful person. And I kept in touch with her; she died two years ago, I think. She lived with her daughter down in Virginia after that. MR: What about Lois McDonald? Smith: Well, she was another first-rate teacher. She started with us as a tutor, and then the Southern Summer School took her over. She rather reflected Louise Leonard's attitudes; I don't think she wanted to affiliate. She was one of the very good English teachers. I haven't kept in touch with her as much as the others, but when I was writing up some of this stuff I remember I hunted her up and got her to verify some of the facts that I was mentioning. 51 MR: How do you think Louise Leonard felt about raising money, you know, from the South? Where did the money came from? Was it from Bryn Mawr? When it came to getting money from the alumnae, did you have any problems in the South? Smith: The Bryn Mawr alumnae? MR: The Bryn Mawr alumnae. Smith: Well, we had from the first year of the Bryn Mawr School. . . , And this was Ernestine Freidmann's work: she organized fifty local committees, mostly headed up by Bryn Mawr alumnae. And they raised the scholarships, they recruited the students. They were supposed to follow them up afterwards and help them                                           And they were all through the South too, you see, when the school first started. So the first southern girls that came to Bryn Mawr were recruited by those district committees for the Bryn Mawr Summer School. Then there was one person down thereI don't think she was on a Bryn Mawr committee, but she was a powerful force in the South__ and that was Lucy Mason. And she was on Louise Leonard* s board at Sweet Briar, and was one of the leaders in the South for years in this field and in every liberal movement. I knew her, but I didn't know her very well. She died in her middle years, I think. But she helped organize these southern committees too. MR: I wondered about the southern girls going back into the South, what problems they had. Because at one stage I read that they were told that one of the ways to get into the community and one of the ways to get money was to go to the League and to go to the Rotary  Clubs, the Kiwanis Clubs and those. ... Smith: What league are you talking about? 52 MR: The League of Women Voters. Smith: Oh. MR: But it seems that they didn't ever do it very much, and I wondered. , , . Smith: The meetings were never at times when they could go if they were working. As I was saying, I struggled with the League and with those organizations to have some meetings on Saturdays or Saturday nights or when the workers could go. But it didn't happen very often. Well, we followed them up as best we could, just as we followed up the rest of the alumnae. I've got some material I think would help you, but I'll have to find it, because the story of the Southern School I know I've written up. MR: That would be helpful. I wondered how Louise Leonard felt about getting money from liberal southern women. I mean, did you find it easy or difficult to go to those women? Smith: No, she didn't, because she knew some of those leaders and worked with them. But I wasn't in direct touch with her, you see. She was organizing in the South, and I kept in touch with her, but I didn't attempt to advise her. I knew she knew what she was doing, and she did. She was a southerner herself. MR: Yes, that's true. Smith: Then I had a great time with her husband in later years, because he was very insistent, and, as I remember, he had become a mental case. Mr. McLaren. And the other day I found some letters from him. He finally just dropped out of existence; I suppose he died. But he was very insistent that nothing had been done to recognize Louise's work. And I said: "Well, I have written it up, and I'm trying to get it published. This is what I'm trying to do right now." But I met him once, and I think he was a great 55 problem to Louise. I think he was a sick man; he was mentally sick. He was in New York; he never joined her in the South at all. I don't think so. I had an address up in the Bronx for him. I don't know; I never went into these relationships. But I remember very well the finance trip I took with her in New York, where we both got almost hilarious laughing because we were turned down wherever we went. And I produced from my bag a few chocolate bars. And Louise said: "Oh, thank goodness you have something to eat'." I said: "Oh, I always do. I know what you go through on these trips; we probably won't get any lunch. And we probably won't see these people. And if we did see them we wouldn't get anything from them." And we got so hilarious over this daughter/ finance trip we sat down on the stairs somewhere, I remember, and ate these chocolate bars /laughter/ and sympathized with each other. MR: It must have been very depressing, Smith: /laughter/ It was hard. Yes, this finance work was really tough. You see, I wasn't an experienced executive, and I didn't realize, actually, that whatever you said (and I said it several times, and the board agreed: "No, you won't have to do money-raising; we'11 get a finance chairman" and so onwhich was entirely fallacious), every executive has to be responsible for money. I was ignorant, really, about administration at that time, and I said: "Well, I'll take the job if I don't have to do the money-raising," "Oh yes," they said, "you won't have to touch it. We'll get a finance chairman," Never found a finance chairman, a national finance chairman. He just didn't exist. Nobody was going to tackle that job for a problem school that was under fire all the time, or be associated with me. And I was in headlines in the Depression: "Federal funds used for red schools." Always with my 54 picture. So the executive had to do money-raising, or get out. And so I tackled it, and I had to learn how to do it. Not too successfully, especially as we ran right into the Depression. MR* Do you think that anyone would have been able to carry on during that period? Smith: As I look back on my work, and you' 11 see in that thing I gave you that it's a rather broad field, I had a sense of constant failures. One school after another had to close. We had to close that Vineyard Shore school after four years. We merged the Barnard School with the W.P.A. The Bryn Mawr School was moved up to the Hudson valley, and then after twelve years there we had to close and Rutgers took it over. And if you look back it was a series of failures. But what actually has happened is that, one way or another, not all through Bryn Mawr and certainly not all through me, we have forty-five colleges and universities right  now with this kind of a program. Not all alike, as you probably know. They send out extension teachers in the winter to union hallsnot only to unions, but to any group of wage earners. And in summer the unions borrow college buildings for institutes. And I think I may have told you, I think it was last year that the steel workers alone borrowed twenty-five university buildings just for the steel workers, MR: So it really wasn't a failure, Smith: It' s a national movement; it has become a national movement. We still have not got those federal funds that I worked with for five years, to try and get that money, to get a plan through. Did you read about the Labor Extension Bill, or did I tell you about it? MR; You told me about it, but then I read a little bit about it. 35 Smith: Well, it was killed in that hostile House committee. But now, you see, they' re getting state funds. They' re getting many more funds from the labor movement, I think. Federal funds will still go ahead, if they ever get around to it. I think it was four or five years ago, I was asked to come to a meeting at the A.F. of L./C.I.O. And the man that invited me said: "We want to discuss this question of federal funds again." So I listened to these very well-informed people. Three of them were on television the other night at twelve o'clock midnight: Larry Rogin, who was our treasurer for years; and Walter Davis, the director of education of A.F. of L./C.I.O,; and Jack McKenzie, who' s heading up the Workers' Education Program in Federal College, Nobody knew that that broadcast was coming at twelve o'clock. I didn't know it; I was surprised to see these three old friends suddenly appearing at midnight, /laughter/ But not a mention of federal funds from any of them. This is a dead issue, really, unless suddenly they revive the idea. But in the meantime, they are getting state funds; they are getting university funds. And now the criticism that I have of them is that the unions aren't pulling their fair share. Because in everything I had anything to do with we recommended this fifty-fifty control which worked so well at Bryn Mawr. And I knew it would work. And the first ones that came out after Bryn Mawr, the first universities, they did have the fifty-fifty, and the unions sent fifty percent. But in the last meeting in Cornell, last August when I was one of the panelists, this came up what the unions are doing* And I said: "Well the last report I've had is that they weren't bothering to send representatives to these joint boards of control in universities." But it's become sort of an established pattern, and they probably don't see why \ they should bother. And what I recommended years ago was that they don't try to get the top people in the unions to sit down with those university people, because they never have time to go to meetings. They ought to try and get the educational directors, or committees from the education departments of the unions to represent them. Well, it' s out of my hands, certainly. They're on their own, and they' re struggling along. And now it's thoroughly an established movement. They may not think they need participation, but I think they should. I think they're losing out if they don't.
