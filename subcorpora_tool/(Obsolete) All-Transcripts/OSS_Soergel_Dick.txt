 Gill. Today is March 24, 2009. I   m visiting with Dick  Soergel here in the  Angie  Debo Room of the OSU library on the  campus of Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. This  interview is part of the O-STATE Stories Project which is part of the  Oklahoma Oral History Research Program. Dick, we   re delighted to  have you with us today. Glad you could take time from Oklahoma City to  come down and visit.  Thank you. It   s always a pleasure to be here on the campus.  Dick, could you start off with where you grew up and tell us about your  family and early life?  Be glad to, Jerry. I grew up in Oklahoma City. My father was on the  Oklahoma City Fire Department and we lived in several different places  in Oklahoma City. We moved around quite a bit. I had two brothers,  both of them are older. My oldest brother was six years older than I am.  He was seriously afflicted with cerebral palsy and he lived quite a life,  and passed away. He must   ve been about 63 or 64 years old, which was  very old for his affliction. He also was able to earn both a bachelor   s and  a master   s degree from, I hate to say it, from the University of  Oklahoma, and I was quite proud of my brother, Johnny.  My other brother I am also quite proud of, he   s four years older than I  am. His name is Don and Don ended up coming to Oklahoma State and  participated in athletics here, but he had a little different route than I had.  When Don finished high school he was an outstanding athlete and had a  baseball and basketball scholarship to Oklahoma University. He started  attending college there and went out for the basketball team. He decided  he didn   t like school very much so he left and joined the Navy. He was  in the Navy for four years, played sports in the Navy and when he got  ready to get out I was in school here at Oklahoma State. He was  5  Gill  Soergel  determined to join me here and he came here on a football and baseball  scholarship. He was always a semester behind me in school so he  became my little brother.  But that was kind of our family. Then, as I was growing up, sports were  always very important to us. My dad had been an outstanding athlete.  He   d been a three sport athlete at Oklahoma City Central High School.  He   d been All-State in all three sports, and upon graduating from high  school, he attended Oklahoma A M College for a brief time. He was on  a football scholarship here at Oklahoma A M and I   d say he probably  was here maybe six weeks and as he said, he didn   t like the smell of ink,  and he was also in love with my mother so he returned to Oklahoma  City. Upon returning to Oklahoma City, OCU had an outstanding  athletic program at that time. Part of OCU   s methodology was that  they   d find athletes that would play in the sports program, but they   d  also get a job on the Oklahoma City Fire Department. So that   s how my  dad became a fireman. He loved the fire department and stayed with it  for 35 years, before retiring.  He attended OCU briefly and was on the OCU football and basketball  teams, but again, the ink didn   t agree with him so he left and became a  full-time Oklahoma City fireman. But his influence in athletics was very  significant in our family and Don was an outstanding athlete, my brother  Johnny helped coach some of the athletic teams in high school and in  college. We attended Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City, which  at that time was one of the strongest sports programs in the state and had  an outstanding record and reputation in sports, so that   s where we  attended high school. My brother Don played football, basketball, and  baseball and was an All-State baseball player. Then I came along and I  played football, basketball, and baseball there. I was an All-State and  All-American high school basketball player and I determined that I  definitely wanted to go to college and continue my education. At that  time I felt like the thing I wanted to do was to go to Oklahoma A M  and play basketball for Mr. Iba and then following basketball, go to  work for Phillips 66 and try to play basketball for the  amateur  basketball team  66ers. That was my goal when I started to think about  going to college. I was recruited by several other universities, but I had  my eye on Oklahoma A M, primarily because of Mr. Iba.  Do you recall some of the other schools that were recruiting you at the  time?  Well, OCU had tried to recruit me. I had letters from Kansas and  Pennsylvania. There were a number of schools that had contacted me.  Probably the most serious was OU. At OU Bud Wilkinson had me down  to Norman and they romanced me a little bit about the football program,  6  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  but Doyle Parrack had just taken over the basketball coaching job and he  was a lot more interested in me coming there and playing basketball. Of  course, OCU also tried to recruit me. Abe Lemons was coaching there  and tried to recruit me to OCU to play basketball. But Iba   s background,  he had known my dad, and in fact he coached Classen High School in  Oklahoma City when my dad was at Central High School. Then, later  Mr. Iba played sandlot baseball and my dad played on some of the same  teams, and so they had known each other and that relationship was there.  Plus, the first college basketball game I ever saw, I was at the All-  College tournament in Oklahoma City at the old municipal auditorium  and watched the Oklahoma Aggies play and I also used to listen to them  on the radio. Curt Gowdy was the voice of the Aggies at one time, and  then Bob Murphy came along afterwards. I just kind of fell in love with  Oklahoma A M. I still hadn   t really committed to anything, and Cliff  Speegle got the head football coaching job here the year before I was  planning to attend. He talked to me about playing football. He wanted  me to play football. I really didn   t intend to play football, I intended to  play basketball. But he really did encourage me to play and then he got  together with Mr. Iba and Mr. Iba encouraged me to play, too. They told  me that I could come to Oklahoma A  M and I   d have a four-year  scholarship in either sport. If I wanted to quit one of them, I   d still have  a four-year scholarship in the other sport. That kind of sold me, so  unintentionally I went out for football.  Just a clarification, Cliff Speegle is your high school coach?  No, Cliff was the brother of my high school coach. C.B. Speegle was my  high school coach. Cliff was the younger brother. And Cliff was a great  guy. C.B. was also. They were really, really super people.  Dick, can I ask you, while we   re still on high school just before we get  into college. There   s a game, a historic game that you played in. At that  time we were just beginning to segregate schools, hadn   t really quite  done that yet. So there   s Douglas High School and Capitol Hill that had  never played against each other, because Douglas being an African  American school, and the white school. Was that your senior year that  you played each other?  My senior year.  Can you share a little bit of background on that?  Well, that   s a game that really has made history; something you  wouldn   t have thought of back at the time. But that was during the  integration time, and that   s when the blacks went to the black school and  7  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  the whites went to the white school. There wasn   t any competition  athletically between the blacks and whites. However, our high school  coach, C.B. Speegle, had become acquainted with Moses Miller who  was the coach at Douglas at the time. We always used to scrimmage  Douglas before we played an actual game. So when I was a sophomore  and when I was a junior, Capitol Hill would suit up over at Capitol Hill  Stadium and we   d go over to Douglas and Douglas would just beat the  dickens out of us. They were very, very physical. But we   d go over and  scrimmage them anyway every year. Then my senior year, integration  was starting to form and C.B. Speegle and Moses Miller got together  and they agreed to schedule a football game. And so they did.  Douglas at that time was a powerhouse. They   d won 46 straight football  games. They had a tailback named Prentice Gautt, who went on to play  at the University of Oklahoma, was the first black football player at OU,  and then played for the professional Cardinals for a number of years. He  was an outstanding player. He was Douglas    tailback. So the contract  was made to play, and it was somewhere in the latter part of November  when Douglas came to Capitol Hill Stadium. The ballgame was  televised, which again was amazing. It was a sellout completely, there  were people standing all around the fence at the ballgame, both blacks  and whites. And it was a bitter, bitter football game. It was hard-nosed,  hard-played football. We were fortunate to end up winning the game. I  think we won it 13-6. Both teams were beat up after it was over, but that  was a major occurrence. And the crowd   there were no problems  whatsoever with the crowd, it all turned out good. That was the  beginning of integrating sports in Oklahoma.  And what year was that?  That was 1955. And people are still writing about it  They   re still talking  about it. We celebrated 55 years, something like that.  Did you have a reunion of both teams?  Well no, not both teams, but some. You know they   re not that many still  around  That   s what happens when you get older, Jerry  There are a lot  of them that are gone. But we did get together and we met at Capitol Hill  Stadium when Capitol Hill and Douglas played this past year. And it  was   it brings back a lot of memories.  Well, I didn   t mean to interrupt your conversation. You were talking  about Oklahoma State and giving the background. And I   m sort of  interested in baseball. You were talking about football and basketball  here, but you also played baseball. Had you had any thought about  playing baseball at that time, before you enrolled at OSU?  8  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Not really. I played baseball all my life. In fact, you   re talking about  historic games. Capitol Hill had one of the greatest baseball programs in  the country. In fact, my brother played on the team that started it, and I  played on the game that ended it, a 63 game winning streak. Capitol Hill  won 63 straight baseball games. Before we lost, I was on the team and  we went down to a little town of Friendship, Oklahoma. We played  Friendship and they had a pitcher named Eddie Fisher and Eddie went  on to the big leagues and probably pitched for 12 or 15 years in the big  leagues, but Friendship beat Capitol Hill down there and that stopped the  winning streak.  But then as I progressed in baseball, I was an infielder and right prior to  my senior year I was playing American league in baseball. We didn   t  have any pitchers, so I told them well I   ll try to pitch. So I started  pitching and I had some success. We went on and our American Legion  team won the state championship. Then we won the regional  championship and then we went to the sectionals in Bismarck, North  Dakota and got beat there by the team that ended up winning the Little  World Series, a Cincinnati team beat us up there. Then I went on to pitch  my senior year in high school and I didn   t lose a game. We won the state  championship. I think I was 14 or 15 and 0. So that was kind of my  baseball go, but I really didn   t think about it much in college and really  had never met Toby Greene, the baseball coach at Oklahoma A M. I  had never met him, never talked to him. I did get to know him because  he helped coach football. He was an assistant football coach too so I  knew who he was, but I really had never had a conversation with him.  One day I was walking down the hall of Gallagher Hall, just walking  along and Coach Greene walked up to me and he said,    Why don   t you  go in the equipment room and check out some baseball shoes?    That   s  how I was recruited to play baseball. And I did, I went in the equipment  room and checked out my baseball shoes when baseball season came,  and started playing baseball. And fortunately we got to play on the team  that won the national championship. We finished third my senior year. I  didn   t get to go to the tournament, I had a knee injury. I made first-team  All-American in baseball. So that was kind of ironic that things  happened like that, but you never know.  Going back a minute talking about just your student experience, not as a  student athlete, but your student experience. First of all, what was your  major?  I was a business major. I majored in General Business.  What were some of the buildings that classes were held in at that time?  9  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Well, the Classroom Building was new. We had classes in the  Classroom Building. Morrill Hall is still there, that was the Business  Building and that was where we had most of the business classes. Then  Old Central, I   ll never forget, we had English classes and psychology  classes in Old Central. I had an English class down in the basement, and  every time it rained that basement would flood. I can remember that, and  then we didn   t have to go to class on those rainy days because the class  was flooded. But those were some of the main buildings and, of course,  the library was here. I used to spend a lot of time in the library, because I  studied a lot in the library. I don   t think I   ve been back in here until now  from the time I left college.  Dick, do you remember some of the professors that you had?  Oh very well, yeah. Very well.  Can you share your thoughts on some of them?  Well, Eugene Swearingen was one of them. He was a wonderful,  wonderful teacher. Dr. Swearingen became a dean of the business  school. Then he became vice president of the University and almost  became president of the University. Then, he left here and became  president of the Bank of Oklahoma in Tulsa. What a neat guy he was.  Dr. Jewett was an accounting professor. Joe Klos was an accounting  professor. One I   ll never forget, if anyone ever took Oklahoma History  here, they would never forget B.B. Chapman. If you ever had B.B.  Chapman, he was quite a teacher. And I can, me and some of my  friends, still recite the thing that he taught us that we   ll never forget. He  would teach us, he   d say,    Students, your information is no better than  your source.    And he   d drill that into us and how important that is and  how true that is. Your information is no better than your source. So you  remember that when you hear things from me here today, that your  information is no better than your source.  What about hangouts on campus? You mentioned the library. The  Student Union, and then maybe some off-campus hangouts?  Oh, I used to spend probably more time in the library than anywhere  because I was pretty busy when I was in school. I was married. I lived in  an apartment and I was playing sports. My freshman year, I   d practice  football in the early afternoon. I think we   d start practice at 2 o   clock  and then when the basketball team would practice that night, I   d go  practice basketball. So I was pretty busy, and fortunately I was able to  study in the library in the mornings. I   d come in early in the mornings,  come to the library and I   d bring my books in here and I would study.  The Student Union, I   d spend some time there, but I really didn   t have a  10  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  lot of time to spend with college hangouts. I just didn   t have the time.  Dick, what about any student activities, organizations, leadership  opportunities? I know you said you were busy in athletics. Did you have  a chance to participate in student activities at all?  I did in some. I   m a member of the Sig-Alph  Sigma Alpha Epsilon or  SAE  Fraternity. I   m a member there. The only sport I got to play there  was volleyball. I really enjoyed that. It was a neat group of guys. I got to  participate some in some of the social activities, not a whole lot. Again,  our budget was tight and we just didn   t have extra money to spend on a  lot of social things. Other clubs, of course I was a member of the O  Club. And back when I was in school, the O Club was pretty active. In  fact, it was very active. First of all, we had some fundraising projects  that some people may remember. One of them was we sold freshman  beanies. When you came onto campus as a freshman, the O Club would  really strong-arm you into paying a dollar for a freshman beanie. We  raised money that way. Then also, the O Club was in charge of  Homecoming. We sponsored the Homecoming dance, so we sold tickets  to the Homecoming dance. We had the Homecoming queen and all that.  So the O Club was much more active during that time than it is today.  You were talking about being married at the time. Did you get married  before you came up to OSU?  No, I got married my freshman year.  And you said you lived off-campus. Did you live in married student  housing?  I lived in several places. The first apartment, Jerry, and I can remember  very vividly, it was over on Scott Street; 115 West Scott. That   s just a  little bit east of Bennett Hall. We rented a three-room, furnished  apartment, and we paid  35 a month and no bills. That was our first  home, and then we lived in some other apartments, right there near that  area. Frank Martin,    Papi    Martin, used to have some rental property in  there. A lot of people remember Frank. He was very active in the band  organization. He was the head of that. We rented an apartment from Papi  Martin there for awhile. Then later they started building the new   well  we called them the new university married student housing out on the  north side of the campus and we moved in there. Prior to that the  university had some married student housing, but it wasn   t too good.  They had Vet Village, it was one area. Then they had the College Courts  over on Sixth Street and those were old Quonset huts that had come out  of World War II and they rented those to married students.  11  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Do you remember how much you got paid per month being married, part  of your scholarship stipend?  Yes, when I came to school on an athletic scholarship, you were entitled  to room, board, books, tuition, and  15 a month. The  15 a month was  supposed to be for laundry money and incidentals. A little later on, the  NCAA did away with that  15 a month and I still think it   s a travesty.  But what a married student would get, they would get the equivalent of  what the athletic department would have to pay for their room and  board, and then the  15 a month. In my recollection, that would total  about  85 a month,  85 or  86 a month. And that was my paycheck. Of  course, the athletic department went ahead and bought my books and  paid for my tuition. But that was my scholarship. We   d have to save  enough money in the summer to subsidize that. And that   s what we did.  We were talking earlier about being a three-sport letterman, and the  background there. Did you have a favorite sport out of those three? I  know you played football, basketball, and baseball at Oklahoma State,  was there a favorite one for you?  Not really. Again, I didn   t intend to play three sports. My intention was  I   d probably find something that I liked better than something else and I  would quit. But I started playing football and I really enjoyed it. We had  a good team, we had good teams. We had winning seasons all three  years I was there. In 1958, we beat Florida State in the one and only  Bluegrass Bowl. Had some success and I really enjoyed it. And  basketball, I came along right in between the time when Oklahoma  A M or Oklahoma State was in the Missouri Valley conference and  changed to the Big Eight Conference. So I got to play in the Missouri  Valley in basketball and some of the football schools too, and then got to  play in the Big Eight when I was a junior and a senior. My first year  here, the basketball team was successful and we made it to the Final  Eight in the NCAA basketball tournament. Kansas State beat us out, but  that was a successful team. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Then in baseball, baseball was a lot of fun and the guys I played with  were really a neat group of guys and we had a lot of fun and we had a lot  of success. We won the conference championship two years. We were in  the Big Eight in baseball three years, but we still are angry over that first  year. We were tied with Missouri for the Big Eight championship and  we went to Columbia to play a three-game series with Missouri. We had  a real strong pitching staff. Missouri had one real good pitcher. Missouri  beat us the first game. And then it started to rain that night. It rained  some; we don   t think it rained that much. But about 8 o   clock that next  morning, John Simmons,  who  was the Missouri coach, called Coach  Greene and said,    Coach, it   s too wet. The games are rained out.    So we  12  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  didn   t get to play Missouri those last two games. We think we could   ve  beaten them and won the Big Eight Championship that year  1958 , but  it didn   t happen. But then the following year we won the Big Eight  Championship and we won the National Championship  1959 . Then the  following year  1960  we won the Big Eight Championship and we were  in the National Tournament in Omaha. I had a problem with my knee. I  don   t know really what caused it, but my knee was swollen and they put  me in a hospital. So I didn   t get to go to the nationals. But the team still  played well and, I think, finished second or third in the national  tournament.  You mentioned earlier playing in the three sports and taking your class  work. Did it take some particular time management and discipline to  make that all work?  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, I can just imagine all the hours you were putting in.  Absolutely. Jerry, in between classes, if I had an hour in between  classes, I had to find a place to go hit those books. I was fortunate I had  a pretty good educational background. Some people may not realize but  at Capitol Hill High School we got a good education if you were willing  to want the education. Now, if you didn   t want it, you could probably  get by without. But I really appreciated my teachers. I had good  teachers. Then, when I came to college, I thought it was really going to  be hard. I thought it was going to be just awfully hard and I wasn   t going  to be equipped for it. Well, mid-semester my freshman year, I think I  had about a 3.6 grade point average  GPA  and then I decided, well it   s  not that hard. Then I kind of got lazy. (Laughs) I ended up making  adequate grades but I got lazy. And then my last two years I was on the  Dean   s Honor Roll. I found out if you applied yourself and you went to  class   that was another thing, I didn   t miss class. I went to class, that   s  what I came for, an education. And that was important to me because I  really ended up being the first one in my family to graduate from  college. The others had gone, but none of them had graduated before I  did. So I had to make use of my time.  Dick, do you know for sure? My understanding is you were the last  three-sport letterman we had at Oklahoma State University.  That   s correct.  And I think people really don   t understand the magnitude and the hours  in a year   s time that that takes and that requires. It just is incredible.  And this is in a fairly modern era of sports. It   s not back in the    30s or  13  Soergel  Gill     20s when we had some of them that did that. Does that give you a sense  of pride for having been able to do that?  Well, it does. It does. I   m proud of the fact that I was able to do it. But  I   m also proud of the fact that I have made so many friends through the  various teams that other people aren   t able to. When I played three  sports, there weren   t many other people doing that in my era either. So it  was very rare. Very rare. And it would   ve been impossible had it not  been for my coaches. Cliff Speegle had played football and basketball at  the University of Oklahoma. Mr. Iba played football, basketball, and  baseball at the college  Maryville Teachers College (now Northwest  Missouri State) , he went to in Missouri. They appreciated all sports,  both of them did. And they encouraged me. They let me have that  opportunity. They didn   t give me anything. They made me make the  teams. But they allowed me that opportunity. Mr. Iba, to allow you to  miss practice for a certain period of time   that was just almost unheard  of. You see he believed in practice. But he let me go through the football  season and then come out right after football and start playing  basketball.  In fact, Jerry, and this is something that was another thing I   ll never  forget, we won the Bluegrass Bowl in 1958 and we played in Louisville,  Kentucky. It was on national television. It was five degrees at kickoff.  They   d had a blizzard hit the week of the game. They had to scrape the  field off with bulldozers. It was ice. We played Florida State. Both teams  wore tennis shoes because cleats wouldn   t go down into the turf. The  national television had a rookie television color man named Howard  Cosell who did the color for the game. We were fortunate enough to beat  Florida State. And I want to say that was early December  December 13,  1958  when we played that bowl game. Well, less than two weeks later,  I was back in Kentucky. I was back in Lexington and I was playing  basketball.  I made the basketball team and I made the trip. We were playing in the  Kentucky Invitational Tournament in Lexington in less than two weeks.  In that particular tournament, West Virginia was there and they had a  guy that turned out pretty good named Jerry West. We played Ohio State  University. They were in that tournament also. At that time John  Havlicek and Larry Siegfried and  Jerry  Lucas were all part of that  team. Then, Kentucky had their usual great basketball team, so we got to  play some really top teams. But I   ll never forget running up and down  that floor. Basketball conditioning is different than football. I was ill-prepared  but they took me anyway, and I   m most grateful that they did  because that was a wonderful experience.  You were part of the 1959  baseball  championship team. I guess that  14  Soergel  was a pretty special year for you  I want to ask you some specific  questions later about that. But could you share some of your highlights  in all three sports, some things you remember, maybe some significant  players, events that you recall?  Oh, I   ve got so many memories, things that happened. You know in  football, golly we played a lot of different schools. Many times you  remember the games you lost more than the ones you won. They stick  with you. We got beat in 1958 by the Air Force Academy out here in  Stillwater. Air Force went on to play in the Cotton Bowl that year, but  they beat us 33-29. We were ahead of them and they had a quarterback  named Richie Mayo and he threw a touchdown pass with nine seconds  to go in the ballgame. Oh, it was just frustrating. And then that same  year, we played OU out in Lewis Field and it was a defensive  knockdown drag out. They beat us 7 to nothing. And we let Bobby Boyd  run a keeper about 30 yards for the only touchdown of the game. And I  think I had a shot at tackling him, but I missed him. I   ll never forget  those things like that.  I also remember going up to Kansas   I remember a lot of things about  defense, you know you played defense, well I had to play defense, too.  We had to play both ways while I was there. I can remember playing  defensive safety and we were playing the University of Kansas up at  Lawrence and it was one of those cold, cold grey days in Kansas. Kansas  had a real good football team. They had John Hadl who was playing  with them, and they had a big halfback named Curtis McClinton and  McClinton weighed about 220lbs and was a Big Eight hurdles  champion. He went on to play in the National Football League for a long  time. I can remember I was playing defensive safety and Kansas had the  ball down on about our five yard line, and they ran a sweep. I can  remember going up and laying my helmet across McClinton   s numbers  like you   re supposed to and that   s the last thing I can remember.  (Laughs) He liked to knock me through the end zone  I knocked him out  of bounds, but that was the only game I ever came out of. He really put a  lick on me and I   ll never forget it.  I can remember going to Milwaukee. We played Marquette in  Milwaukee one year, and I can remember we were behind with about  three minutes to go and had the ball on our own three yard line. We took  it down the field, run the little sideline passes and stuff and scored a  touchdown right at the end of the ballgame and beat Marquette. It was a  memorable game. I have a lot of memories. Those are football  memories.  In basketball, the one I   ll never forget, we beat Kansas in Lawrence  when I was a senior. And we weren   t that good of a basketball team. But  15  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  we got ahead of Kansas and we could take care of the basketball. And I  was one of our centers, believe it or not, I had to play inside. So the guy  that I was guarding, the guy that guarded me was a guy named  Hightower, Wayne Hightower, and he was about 6   8   . He ended up  going into the pro   s and playing pro ball, was a good basketball player.  But he was trying to guard me and we went into Mr. Iba   s famous delay  game, and I   m telling you, trying to defend that, it would wear you out.  Gosh that poor old guy that was guarding me, before the game was over  he wanted out of the game so bad. And since Hightower was so tall, Mr.  Iba would have me bring the ball down the court. So I   d take the ball in  as a guard at the opposite end. Hightower ended up fouling out because  he wanted out. He was just grabbing and holding on. And we went on to  beat the Jayhawks in Lawrence. You don   t do that very often.  Did you play in the famous game against Wilt Chamberlain?  No, I was a freshman.  Did you see the game?  Oh, absolutely. What a thrill that was.  Beating Kansas and Wilt Chamberlain in a last-second jump shot     Yeah, Mel Wright hit that shot right about the top of the circle. And I   ll  never forget it, it was tremendous.  Did you play basketball with Eddie Sutton?  Yes.  Was he a senior when you were a sophomore?  He was a senior when I was a sophomore.  What do you remember about Eddie as a player?  Oh, Eddie was a good player. Whether people know it or not, Eddie was  a real fine offensive player. He wasn   t necessarily that much of a  defensive player, although you had to play defense if you were going to  play for Mr. Iba. But Eddie could really shoot the ball. In the Kansas  game, Mel hit the winning shot, but Eddie knocked in a bunch of baskets  from outside. If they   d had the three-point shot   they didn   t have the  three-point shot at that time   Eddie would   ve scored a bunch of points  because he could really shoot. And he was a sound player, Eddie was  always sound. He didn   t have the greatest speed, but he didn   t make  16  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  mistakes, could shoot the ball well, and played good defense. And was a  good team member. Eddie was a good guy to play with.  Was he a graduate assistant coach after he graduated for a year or two?  Yes, he was.  So he maybe helped coach you later?  Yeah, he did. He helped coach the next year. We had a fair team then.  Arlen Clark was our main player and I was our number two scorer, and  that was bad when I was the number two scorer. But Arlen was a good  player. He was an All-American here. And Eddie was a graduate  assistant.  Dick, were there some other players that stand out in your mind in any  of those sports that you played with? Not that they weren   t all good  certainly, but some that you recall especially?  Oh yes, we had some really good athletes. I think maybe the best athlete  I ever played with anywhere was Jerry Adair. Jerry Adair was a fantastic  player. He had played football, basketball, and baseball at Sand Springs,  but he came to Oklahoma State and didn   t play football. He played  basketball and baseball. In basketball, he was a terrific basketball player.  He was about 6   2    or 6   3   , a guard, and quick, and could really, really  play. Then in baseball he was our shortstop. He was an All-American  baseball player, he was a leading hitter. We   d have had a lot better  basketball team the following year if Jerry hadn   t signed a professional  baseball contract. He signed a pro baseball contract and went on and  played. I bet he played 12 or 13 years in the major leagues. At one time  I know he held the record for the most consecutive chances at 2nd base  without an error. He was a gifted, gifted athlete. In addition to Adair,  Tony Banfield was a football player I played with. He played halfback  and was a defensive safety. Tony went on to play in the pros for the  Houston Oilers. He made all-pro down there. Outstanding athlete and a  super guy. Other basketball players    Arlen Clark was an outstanding  basketball player. He made All-American here and then went on to play  for the Phillips   s 66ers. But a lot of good athletes, we had a lot of good  athletes.  What do you remember about your coaches? I guess let   s start with Cliff  Speegle in football, and of course Mr. Iba in basketball, and Toby  Greene in baseball. Could you share your stories about those coaches?  Well, our coaches were all good. Cliff was a sound, really a sound  football coach and a true gentleman. I don   t believe I ever heard Cliff  17  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Speegle say a swear word at all. He was just a very clean cut, super nice  gentleman. Some people would say he was too nice to be a coach.  Perhaps that   s true, but he was a good coach, he was very sound. He had  good assistants,  Neil Armstrong was also one of ourfootball coaches  and Neil went on to be an assistant football coach for the Houston  Oilers, Minnesota Vikings, Dallas Cowboys and was the head coach of  the Chicago Bears . Harry Buffington was an outstanding line coach. I  think we had five assistants and they were all good. Jim Spavital was  good   most of them, most all of them were Aggies. They played here.  Dorsey Gibson,  Henry Buffington, Jim Spavital, Otis Delahart and  Davey Gibson were all outstanding coaches. Toby Greene did the  scouting and Jack Baker coached the freshmen.   It was an Oklahoma A M group that coached us in football. We had  some good schemes. I would say that we were far too conservative on  offense. We tried to play defensive football and we had some athletes  that could   ve done better, I think, offensively if we   d been a little more  aggressive. Another outstanding athlete we had was a guy named  Dwayne Wood and Dwayne was a super halfback from Wilburton and  went on and played for the Kansas City Chiefs. In fact, Dwayne may be  one of the only guys I ever heard of that played a full year in the  Canadian Football League and they finished their season earlier, then he  went right on with the Chiefs and played their full season. So Dwayne  was truly a gifted athlete. But you know, they could catch the ball and I  could throw the ball. But we didn   t loosen them up quiet enough. Jerry,  in my senior year I was the tenth leading passer in the nation and I  completed over 60  of my passes, but we just didn   t throw it enough.  We could   ve spread them out a little bit and throw the look-ins and  sidelines and the corners and the posts. We had the people that could   ve  done it, but the coaches determined that we were going to run the ball in  there. I   m sorry we didn   t try to throw it more. All of my coaches were  sound coaches, their schemes were good. Mr. Iba, nobody ever had  sounder schemes than he did. Of course he was defensive oriented, too.  You didn   t shoot the ball a lot for him. If you did, you better hit it or you  weren   t going to be playing. He didn   t mind you shooting if you hit it.  Well, he was legendary for his discipline. Was he as tough as everybody  said he was?  He was. That he was.  And did you participate in any of those three-a-days they had during  Christmas?  Absolutely, and it was awful.  18  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Can you share a little bit about that?  Oh, you used to hate the holidays because we   d practice three times a  day. And if you taped your ankles, you didn   t have time to take the tape  off, you   d just leave it on until the next practice. You   d go out there and  start practicing. And Mr. Iba, I grew to be very, very close to him in later  years. We worked together and he was a really tremendous friend. We  talked a lot about his philosophy and he didn   t think hard work hurt you.  He didn   t believe you got stale. But he did believe that you needed to  change your drills. He said as long as you keep changing your drills, you  can just work    em and work    em and work    em. I can remember he did. I  also can remember, and I do believe this, that sometimes when we   d go  on the road and play out of town and we   d have a shoot-a-round the  morning before the game, some of those shoot-a-rounds would end up  being full-time scrimmages. That night when we   d get ready for the  game, we were a little bit tired-legged and I think that wasn   t always  good.  But I   ll always remember Mr. Iba. He made sure he had your attention. I  love the way today you watch basketball teams come over to timeouts  and maybe they bring a bunch of chairs out on the floor and you just  watch the players and they   re looking around, gawking around. Well,  when you came out for a time out with Mr. Iba, he had you lay down on  your stomach, facing him. He had five players gathered around him, he  was sitting on the bench, and you couldn   t look around. He had your  absolute attention. You weren   t going to be looking at the girls. You  were going to pay attention to what he said. And he had great ideas, he  was just so sound.  Then, Toby Greene, baseball coach, he was another sound coach, but  Toby never said much. But when he did, you better jump, because he  meant it. And I was fortunate enough to really play for good coaches.  Your favorite Henry P. Iba story. Have you got a favorite one, Dick?  Oh, I   ve got so many of them. He loved to go mushroom hunting. He   d  grown up hunting mushrooms up in Missouri. After I was working for  him, he used to just love getting me, Buel McElroy and Sam Aubrey and  we   d go mushroom hunting. If you   ve never hunted mushrooms, you go  down on a riverbank. You go where all those briars are there, and you  wade through those briars and you look for mushrooms. You   d have to  find them there kind of in a shady place. We   d find the mushrooms and  we   d pick the briars out and you were kind of afraid to eat them anyway,  but if Mr. Iba said they were good, they had to be good. But he used to  get the biggest kick out of that. He   d come up and he   d say,    You ready  to go mushroom hunting?    I says,    No, Mr. Iba, I don   t want to go  19  Gill  Soergel  Gill  again.    And,    Oh yeah, let   s go mushroom hunting.     Then, I remember he liked to fish too. He had an old fly rod. He liked to  catch frogs on that fly rod. He   d see a frog sitting out there on the lake or  the pond and he   d take that old fly and he   d flip it out there and that frog  would grab it and you had something on there when he got that frog. But  I remember we went out to  Lake  Carl Blackwell one time and I  drove   he had a pickup truck and, of course, Mr. Iba was retired and I  was driving his truck. We went out there and we fished for awhile, and  then we decided we were going to go look for another place. We got on  one of those roads and I got that truck stuck on high center. (Laughs)  There we were and, of course, there are no cell phones or anything,  you   re just out there. And we laughed about that. He said,    Here I am an  old man, and you don   t know what you   re doing.    So we ended up, we  put enough stuff under the wheels to get it out and we got it off high  center. But we used to laugh about that. Lot of good things. Lots of good  things about Mr. Iba.  What do you remember about the facilities that you played in? Could  you share a little bit about  them ? Not anything like they are today, but  what do you remember about them?  Well, we really didn   t have the best facilities. It was kind of sad.  Football, particularly. In football, our dressing room was down in the  basement of Gallagher Hall, and Gallagher Hall leaked when it rained  and it was kind of like Old Central. When it rained, our dressing room  would be flooded and you   d have to stand on the benches to put your  equipment on. So that wasn   t real good. The atmosphere wasn   t real  good either, it was dark and dreary. It just wasn   t real conducive to  building up your enthusiasm. But the football field itself, the practice  fields were good. They had good turf on them and they worked out fine.  Didn   t have any lights, and we were glad of that. We had one old flood  light and that was down at the southwest corner of the practice field.  We   d be practicing down there and it   d get late, we could kind of move  under that one old flood light. It was dark, it wasn   t very good. But then  also, about every day, when some of those football players would be  going to school, they   d go knock that flood light out so we wouldn   t  have to practice (laughs) late. I can remember some of those things.  Then the football field itself was fine. The stadium wasn   t the greatest,  but it was adequate. The baseball park was adequate. Gallagher Arena  was a super place to play basketball. That floor, and I   m glad they still  have it, it was the best floor I ever played on. It was really, really good.  And the atmosphere and everything was good. The basketball situation  was the best.  What do you remember about down under Gallagher?  20  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Oh, that   s another thing, down under Gallagher was the basement. It was  dirt, an all dirt floor. It had the concrete pillars that were in there in  between, and that   s where we   d practice football sometimes down there  when the weather would get bad. Of course, there wasn   t a lot of room  in between those pillars and you could do one-on-one blocking down  there pretty good because there wasn   t any place to escape. Then the  baseball team practiced down there. We had a batting cage and it was a  rope batting cage and room for a pitcher and a catcher. You could put a  batter in there and the pitcher could throw batting practice to him. Toby  Greene was a detailed-oriented person. He   d sit behind the screen and he  would chart every pitch, and he would chart the hitters, whether you hit  the ball solid or fouled it off, missed it or what. He   d have a book on  you. He used that as part of his basis for how you made the team.  I   ll never forget, oh gosh, one day I was down there   I never got to go  down there very often because I didn   t get out early enough for baseball,  but I did go down there and I was pitching batting practice and we had a  protector screen that would go up about waist high in front of the pitcher  so you could duck behind it and dodge those line drives coming back.  They use them all the time and they still use them today as protection for  the batting practice pitcher. One day I was down there pitching and the  catcher caught the ball and he was throwing it back to me. Well he hit it  and ricocheted right off the top of that protector screen and hit me right  square in the head. (Laughs) Oh, I thought Toby was going to kill that  catcher. And he was scared to death, he was a freshman catcher, he was  scared to death. Well, it hit me in the head and fortunately it was the best  place, didn   t hurt me much. But he was scared to death and I walked  down to him and I grabbed him around the shoulders and said,    Can   t  you throw any harder than that?    And everybody just laughed and went  on and that was the end of it. But he didn   t get in any trouble after that.  Did it ever get a little dusty down there?  Oh, it got dusty and dirty and the balls would get dirty. That old red dirt  down there. I can remember Toby sitting up in the equipment room and  he   d use a can of Pet milk and he   d wash those old baseballs with Pet  milk so it would whiten them up. I remember him sitting there doing that  so we could take batting practice down there.  We were talking earlier about the Douglas ballgame with Capitol Hill,  the period of integration, this is also the time of integration in  intercollegiate athletics. I wanted to ask you if you remember some of  the early African American student athletes enrolled at Oklahoma State  University, and if you do, could you share some of your memories about  that?  21  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Absolutely. We had the first black athletes that came and played here at  Oklahoma State. Of course, the first one was Orlando Hazley and he was  a track man. I wasn   t on the track team, but knew Orlando and what a  fine gentleman he was and truly a great sprinter. He was a 9.4 sprinter  for real and he ran with the greatest sprinters of that time. He was also a  guy that could get along with people. I am in awe of those early athletes  because of some of the things they had to go through because it wasn   t  easy. Many restaurants wouldn   t serve them. They couldn   t stay in some  of the hotels. It was just difficult. Orlando, I believe he came the same  year I did. I think he was in my class. I think he came here in    56.  Then, in    57 we had the first black football player that played here. A  guy named Chester Pittman, and Chester was a little halfback from  Wewoka. What a nice guy Chester was. He was a good teammate and  just a good guy to be with. I   ll never forget some of the difficulties he  went through. We used to always play Arkansas in Little Rock and when  we took Chester over to Little Rock with us we stayed in the hotel in  downtown Little Rock. When we drove the buses up to the hotel Chester  didn   t get off and we didn   t know what was happening. We soon found  out that Chester couldn   t stay in the hotel with us. Had to take him to a  hotel for blacks. And we really felt bad about it and we were trying to  console Chester and I can remember he laughed at us and he said,     Guys, don   t you worry about me, you know I   ll have a lot more fun  than you will.    He just could handle things like that. I   ll never forget  how bad it was when he went out on the football field. I think he was  the first black football player that ever played there in War Memorial  Stadium. The crowd booed him. It was just awful. Old Chester just  endured it.  Then we used to play the University of Houston, too and we stayed in a  yacht club down near Galveston Bay and Chester wasn   t allowed to go  into the dining room with us. His roommate was Tony Banfield and  Tony would just eat in the room with Chester. But it was just tough for  those guys. The first black basketball player we had was a guy named  L.C. Gordon. L.C. was from Memphis. Another really, really nice guy.  He could get along, I mean those early pioneers. They had to take a lot  of abuse. I remember going into a cafeteria in Kansas City. Our  basketball team went in and we lined up with our trays on the counter  and they came over and said,    Well, we can   t serve L.C. in here.    We all  just got up and left. But that kind of thing went on and they had to be  able just to turn the other cheek and keep going to make it work.  Was there a black baseball player that you played with?  There were a couple of black guys that came out for the baseball team,  but I don   t   none of them really made the team, so I don   t really  22  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  remember them. I never got close to any of those guys.  Were there some special honors and recognitions you got? First as a  student, you said you made the Dean   s Honor Roll a few times. Any  other honors, recognitions as a student you recall?  Oh, I was one of the, what do you call them, Redskin Congratulates?  Something like that. That recognized some of the students at OSU. I  received an award from my fraternity that was a significant sort of an  award, more academically and athletically, it was kind of a combination  thing. That was about it. I wasn   t a great student, don   t get me wrong. I  could go to class and if I worked hard I could pass. I wasn   t a great  student, but I could make my grades.  You mentioned some of your athletic honors. Can you tick off some of  those? I know you started in all three sports for three years, isn   t that  correct?  Yes.  Some recognition, conference, national recognition in any or all of those  sports that you recall?  Well, of course, I made All-American in baseball. In football I didn   t  make All-American or All-Conference. I never got to play in a  conference in football. We were in between conferences. We didn   t have  a full-schedule of Big Eight teams and we   d just gotten out of the  Missouri Valley. They put me on the All-Academic Big Eight team. But  I was either the leading passer or the second leading passer in the  conference even though we didn   t play a full slate of Big Eight games.  So I didn   t do that well there. And then my junior year I made the  Honorable Mention on the All-Conference basketball team as a junior.  Didn   t play that good as a senior. But those were some of the things that  happened when I was in college.  Well you graduated in 1960, is that right?  1960.  With a bachelor   s degree in general business?  General business.  Can you share some about your professional career in your life? Just  kind of hit some highlights after you left OSU?  23  Soergel  Well, when I graduated from OSU I first tried to play professional  football and I signed a contract with the Boston Patriots in the American  Football League. It was the first year of the American Football League.  The Green Bay Packers had tried to sign me and at that time, they didn   t  pay professional athletes like they do today, particularly football players.  And the top quarterbacks in the NFL at that time were probably making   25,000 a year, and that was about the tops. So they didn   t pay that  much and I ended up getting, I think I got  500 more to sign with  Boston than with Green Bay. But I always remember Green Bay trying  to sign me. The coach there that was trying to convince me I should go  ahead and come with Green Bay, he said,    Now you know, we really  need a quarterback here. We   ve got an older quarterback named Lamar  McCann who   s kind of about over-the-hill and then we   ve got some  young rookie named Bart Starr that you know he   s not there either.     Bart Starr ended up having a pretty good career so I probably made the  good choice anyway and went to the Patriots. I stayed there for two  months, got through the exhibition season. The first year of the  American  Football  League was kind of an interesting time because you  didn   t have any nucleus, you had to build a team from scratch. I wasn   t  ready to be a pro-quarterback my first year. I really hadn   t ever thrown  drop back passes to speak of. They kept me around for quite awhile. But  I really wasn   t ready to start as an NFL quarterback. So right before I  left they brought in a guy named Babe Pirelli and Pirelli had had a lot of  experience and had been an All-American at Kentucky. They also had  another older guy from Boston College that had played in the Canadian  League named Butch Songin. So those were the two quarterbacks they  kept. They kept me around so long that it would   ve been difficult for me  to go somewhere else.  Another significant thing at that time, very few of your football players  had what are called no-cut contracts. In other words if you signed a  professional football contract you might get a bonus, whatever kind of  bonus you signed for, but your contract really didn   t take effect until you  were on the team when the season started. So they could wait right    till  the end to cut you and they didn   t have to pay you. I found out that  professional football, as all professional sports, it   s a business. They kept  me around until the end and they said,    Well Denver and a couple other  teams would like to have you.    Well I knew if I went somewhere else  it   d be just such a quick look it wasn   t worth my time. And I had a  family to support so I needed to go to work.  Then, after that didn   t work out, I went into the life insurance business  and was trying to make a living there. I was kind of struggling along  there, working in Stillwater, loved Stillwater. Was working for Bob  Fenimore and I found out that Cliff Speegle wanted to hire me as OSU   s  24  Gill  Soergel  freshman football coach. Well, that would   ve really helped me. It  would   ve given me a chance to make a few extra dollars and also  continue in the insurance business. But just prior to things happening  there, the Athletic Cabinet here at OSU determined that the business of  athletics was growing and they needed somebody to be a business and  ticket manager for the athletic program. One of the people that was  instrumental on that athletic cabinet was Dean Swearingen, who had  been one of my professors. He was touting me for that job. At that time,  Mr. Iba had another gentleman that was working for him, had been hired  as his secretary really and his name was Harry Dolman. Harry served to  some degree in that function as a business and ticket manager, but not  really. But Mr. Iba was really, really loyal to all his people. He wasn   t  interested in replacing Harry, but Swearingen and the Athletic Cabinet  kept working on him. They recognized they needed to have somebody  and Mr. Iba agreed on me. So they ended up hiring me as OSU   s first  athletic business and ticket manager.  What year was that?  It was 1962. I worked for OSU for 16 years. It got into a period of time  during the Floyd Gass era that there was a lot of controversy regarding  the athletic program. I determined that I needed to get out. It might   ve  been a mistake, but I determined that I needed to change professions.  Well, I was about 40 years old, a little old to start changing professions.  But I had the opportunity to join a bank. I was hired as a vice president  of a small bank here in Stillwater and learned an awful lot in that small  bank because you had to do everything. Then, I determined again that I  needed to move on to where there were more opportunities, and I had  some friends at the Liberty National Bank in Oklahoma City. Gordon  Greer, a lot of you OSU people will know Gordon, well he was the  President of Liberty and I knew Gordon. So I asked him if I could  interview there for a job. I was thinking about the lending field, because  that was kind of the direction I was going, to be a loan officer in the  bank.  I happened to go to Liberty and had lunch with Gordon and while I was  there another fellow named Ken Brown saw me. Well, I didn   t realize  that he had seen me there, but I had known Ken   I played baseball with  Ken at Cherokee, Oklahoma in a semi-pro league and Ken remembered  me. He went to Gordon and he said,    What   s he doing here?    He told  him I was looking for a job, and Ken had a job open as a division  manager in the investment department. Well, I didn   t know anything  about investments. I knew a little bit about loans and a little bit about  banking, but not anything about investments. But Ken asked Gordon,     Would you mind if I talked to him?    So he called me and had me come  down and interview, and visited with me a little bit, then he had some  25  Gill  Soergel  Gill  other people talk to me. I told him,    Ken, I don   t know anything about  investments.    And he said,    Well, you know, you can learn.    I said,     Well yeah, I probably can.    But anyway, they ended up hiring me as  the manager of the government investment division of the Liberty  National Bank. Well, I didn   t know a treasury bill from a treasury note. I  just remember I got a bunch of books and I went into my office and shut  the door and I started reading. And I started learning. And I learned a lot.  I managed a group of people there and they were good to manage, and  went on and took over the investment department completely, helped  manage the bank   s portfolio, did a lot of trades, travelled to a lot of  banks here in Oklahoma. I probably have been in more than 100 banks  here in Oklahoma calling on different bankers, selling investment  services. So I stayed in the investment area.  The Liberty  Bank  in Oklahoma City ended up buying the First  National Bank of Tulsa and they merged the two banks. When they  merged the two banks, my area went to the Tulsa office. So that offered  me an opportunity to move into the Trust Department. The Head of the  Trust Department at Liberty asked me if I would be interested in coming  to work there. So I started to work in Trust and again a new learning  experience. I didn   t know anything about trusts. But I ended up in the  Trust Department and I worked with employee benefit plans, pension  plans, profit sharing plans. Did a lot of work with government  regulations. But then eventually had an opportunity to come back to  investments, which I truly loved. And I ended up being the manager for  trust investments for the Liberty Banks of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. We  managed a lot of assets. We had over  2 billion in trust assets, I was  responsible for that. We had I don   t know how many accounts. We also  had the safekeeping of probably somewhere over  6 or  7 billion of  assets that we were responsible for. That   s what I ended up doing and  we were doing real well up until the Bank One of Columbus, Ohio came  in and bought Liberty. Well, Bank One was a large national bank and  my job was going to go to Columbus. I didn   t want to go to Columbus.  So I retired. And that   s what I am right now, retired and I   ve enjoyed it.  I had a very enjoyable working career but I   m enjoying retirement now.  The Bank One of Columbus ended up being purchased by J.P. Morgan  Chase. That   s who they are now. So that bank consolidation was quite a  time.  Dick, can we go back a little bit, I guess nearly 16, 18 years you spent at  Oklahoma State University?  Yes.  And I know you moved into the assistant athletic director and business  manager position. Can you talk a little bit about some of the people,  26  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  staff, coaches, you remember during that period? This was from 1962 to     80? Somewhere along in there, is that correct?  Yeah. It was amazing the number of staff and coaches that came through  this university. There were so many football coaches and so many that  went on to be very successful. The first one I remember that became  very successful wasn   t here when I was working here, but was one of  my freshman coaches, a graduate assistant, Buddy Ryan. Of course,  Buddy went on to fame with the Chicago Bears and so forth. And then  after I went to work with OSU, the famous one that I remember working  with that was such a character was Sammy Baugh. Slingin    Sammy  Baugh became the freshman football coach here one year. And Sammy  was a real character. Of course, he was a legend in the National Football  League, maybe the greatest passer of all time. Ended up doing a lot of  different things, ended up coaching the Houston Oilers. I think that was  his last coaching job, but we had him here as our freshman coach one  year.  I can remember Bowden Wyatt. Bowden Wyatt, oh man, what a  character he was. And Bowden, he had a great football reputation. He   d  been the head football coach at Wyoming and he left the Wyoming job  and went to Arkansas and was very successful at Arkansas. They won  the Southwest Conference. Then he went back to his alma mater,  Tennessee, the University of Tennessee. They hired him and he coached  there and had a great deal of success. I think they were the number one  team in the nation at one time. They had Johnny Majors as their tailback  and Bowden was very successful but then he kind of dropped by the  wayside and he ended up coming to Oklahoma State. And Jerry, as you  say, you remember him, he was a tough old boy but a real character.  And of course Frank Gansz went on to coach Kansas City. Golly, just so  many. Jim Stanley, he was on Phil Cutchin   s coaching staff, Willy  Zapalak, Elwood Kettler. Just many, many, many coaches who   ve been  through this school and have done well and been successful. Many of  them have gone on to other places. And, of course, I left, I retired or  resigned here at Oklahoma State just when Jimmy Johnson came along.  So I was here more through the Jim Stanley, Floyd Gass, Phil Cutchin,  Cliff Speegle era.  What about athletic directors that you worked with? Of course, Mr. Iba,  obviously. And you worked with Floyd Gass?  Floyd Gass. Mr. Iba, you know, I just can   t say enough good things  about him. There never was a man that was more loyal. If you were his  staff and you were with him and you were   I mean he might get on to  you about something, but he was loyal to his people. Maybe even to a  fault. But what a great guy. And his management philosophy was  27  Gill  Soergel  different. I don   t believe we ever had any staff meetings. He didn   t  manage that way, he did it one-on-one. He   d get you in his office and  he   d talk about things with you. You knew he was in charge. There  wasn   t any doubt about that. But he could handle people. He was a great  people person. And the people that he had were all very loyal to him.  They were very, very loyal. Sam Aubrey was his assistant basketball  coach. Nobody was any more loyal than Sam. Ralph Higgins was the  track coach. Labron Harris was the golf coach. Cliff Speegle was the  football coach. Toby Greene was the baseball coach. They all were loyal  and worked together. It was really a family. Otis Wile was the Sports  Information Director. All the people got along. We got along with each  other. It wasn   t a selfish organization, and that   s what made it good. We  helped each other. I can remember Higgins and Labron, they took care  of the scoreboard for the basketball team forever. They didn   t get paid  for that, they just did it. They   d run the clock and take care of the  scoreboard. I can remember when Higgins would have a track meet  some of us would go out and help him mark the track off and put the  hurdles up. We just worked together. It was a good situation.  Then things started changing a little bit. Mr. Iba left and a lot of politics  got involved. It got very, very political here for awhile. Floyd Gass came  in, and Floyd was a nice guy, but Floyd came in with a lot of the politics  attached to him. He was very close to the Board of Regents, and the  Board of Regents really supported Floyd in becoming the athletic  director here. I worked with Floyd and got along with him very well. He  just kind of left me alone and let me run my shop and we got along  good. But Floyd had a lot of controversy, and again there were a lot of  people taking shots at people. It got to be where it was kind of  frustrating with all the politics that were going on. People were going to  the Board of Regents and trying to get this person fired or that person  fired. It wasn   t the family situation that Mr. Iba had initially.  Dick, what were some of the main issues at that time when you were  working?  Well, of course, when Cliff Speegle got fired and they brought in Phil  Cutchin. Phil   s attitude, Phil was a nice guy too and a good coach, but  Phil   s attitude was completely dominated by football. He thought  football ought to be it and that hadn   t been the way it was at Oklahoma  State and it created some difficulties. Phil went ahead and did some  good things. He brought the football program up. He got the facilities  improved. They built the football dressing room down there on the  corner. He got the offices improved. He did a lot of good things. But I  think he didn   t lend toward the camaraderie that we   d had previously.  Then when Floyd came in there was a sentiment around that, the reason  that Oklahoma State   s football program wasn   t good was because of Mr.  28  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Iba. And that   s not true, Mr. Iba loved football. He wanted football to be  successful. But a lot of the controversy stemmed around our football  program wasn   t as good as we   d like to have it. And Mr. Iba took a lot  of that blame and consequently all the people connected with Mr. Iba  took on some of that blame. I took on a bunch of it. It wasn   t all that  much fun. Floyd didn   t indicate to me that I was on shaky ground, but  the Board of Regents was out there and they were trying to micro-manage  this university at that time. Dr. Kamm could attest to that if he  were still around. It was difficult.  He had a different idea in mind I think, didn   t he? Selection process.  Yes, yes he did.  We won   t go there. Dick, one of the things that was beginning to emerge  in your time was fundraising. And of course, it   s huge now. Can you  remember some of the early beginnings of fundraising?  I remember very well, Jerry. Mr. Iba   s mentor was Dr. Henry G.  Bennett. I never knew Dr. Bennett, but I felt like I knew him because  Mr. Iba had talked about him so much. I used to spend hours talking to  Mr. Iba about all kinds of philosophy and how to operate and different  things. He used to talk a great deal about Dr. Bennett. He would tell  stories that Dr. Bennett wasn   t real interested in going out and raising  money from the alumni because once you start getting money from  them, you also get their input. And first thing, they   re trying to run your  program and they   re trying to run the university. Dr. Bennett didn   t want  that. But Dr. Bennett was so strong politically that he felt like he could  get things done through politics rather than going out and raising money  through alumni. That   s what he was able to do, but unfortunately he was  killed in a plane crash in the early 1950s. He was at that time head of the  Point Four Program and was on a trip in Ethiopia and was killed in a  plane crash. Well, that didn   t help Oklahoma A M   s political power, so  the financing got to be more and more of a problem.  Frankly, the university used to provide much of the financing for the  athletic program here at Oklahoma State. We began to get pressures  from the legislature and I think OU was one of the main reasons   they  couldn   t understand that we could compete with them and we didn   t  have near the money they had. Part of the reason we could compete was  because the university helped fund athletics and there was a lot of  juggling done in the early days here at Oklahoma State where the  university could pick up a lot of that funding. But when the legislature  started taking looks and they began questioning the funding, it became  evident that the athletic program was going to have to fund itself. And  the only way you could do that was to start raising outside funds.  29  Gill  Soergel  I remember the first athletic fundraising group that I was associated  with. A separate corporation was formed here called the Oklahoma  Educational Foundation. A man named Lee Gilstrap was a retired  colonel from the military and was a speech professor here on campus  and really a neat guy. They assigned Colonel Gilstrap the responsibility  to go out and raise money for athletics. I remember my first year I think  we raised a little over  2,000 and thought that was just absolutely  wonderful to raise that kind of money through outside donations. But  that   s what Colonel Gilstrap did. Then more evolution came along.  Howard    Moose    Johnson was assistant to the athletic director here and  he took over some of the fundraising aspects of athletics and another  corporation was formed. It was called the Oklahoma State Athletic Fund  Incorporated and it was designed to raise money for athletics. People  would make checks out to Oklahoma State Athletic Fund and they   d  send them to Moose. Then he   d get them to me and we   d deposit them  into a banking account.  Also at that time, a lot of people don   t realize it, but the athletic program  didn   t operate as a department of the university. It was a separate  corporation. It was called the Oklahoma A M Colleges and Universities  Athletic Association. We had our own bank account down at Stillwater  National Bank. We wrote checks on that bank account. We deposited  our money into that bank account. We didn   t function exactly as a  university department. But again, things began to change and it became  more evident that we needed to become a true department of the  university, and we needed to raise funds. The university was also getting  more into fundraising and the OSU Foundation began to function. I can   t  remember exactly what the name of it was to begin with, Jerry, you  might remember. But I remember Bob Irwin was the director initially of  the foundation.  I think it   s called the OSU Development Foundation.  I think that   s right. I think that   s what it was called. Bob Irwin, in fact he  had been one of my instructors. He   d been a marketing professor before  taking over the head of the OSU Development Foundation. They hired a  couple of guys to raise money for athletics because people would give  money to athletics. They might not give it to other things, but they  would give it to athletics. They hired a guy named Merlin London.  Really a nice guy. And Tom Turvey. Tom had been a football coach,  and Merlin had been a football coach up at Tonkawa at Northern Junior  College. They were very much in tune with athletics and they worked  for the foundation but they primarily were out raising money for  athletics. We developed procedures where the money would go directly  into the Foundation. There were some other fundraising things that  probably went on, but basically we determined that the need was to  30  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  make sure everything went through that OSU Foundation. So that was  the beginning of it as I remember. And now, my goodness, how it   s  grown and what a wonderful thing.  Can you share a little with us about your family, Dick?  Oh, I   m just so fortunate. My wife, we   ve been married for 52 years  now. She   s just a wonderful lady. We were high school sweethearts.  And her name is?  Her name is Gwen. Last name was Howard. She   s still working. She  works for a dentist in Oklahoma City. She loves it. She loves people.  And so that works out real fine. When our children were growing up she  never worked outside the home. At that time, she raised our children.  We had a son, Rick. Rick passed away in 1995 from lymphoma. At that  time, he was a banker at the Bank of Oklahoma in Tulsa. Quite a sad  thing in our lives. But we also have a daughter. Her name is Sandi  Warner. Sandi has five children, she has triplets. We have triplet  granddaughters. They   re just a joy. She lives in Edmond, Oklahoma and  she   s a housewife there and a wonderful mother. That   s basically our  family. My brother, Don, is still living and he lives a little north of  Edmond, he and his wife. They   ve been married about 50 years now. My  mother and father are deceased and my wife   s are deceased. But that   s  our family.  What about community activities, church activities?  Oh, I   m telling you what. I belong to the most wonderful church you  could ever imagine. It   s Crossings Community Church in Oklahoma  City. I   ve been a member there for about five years now. Prior to that,  we were members of a Baptist church there in Oklahoma City for about  20 years and I was very active in it   probably got too involved in it and  it became a good time for me to move on and we joined Crossings. It   s  such a delightful place and such a joy. I belong to, we call it a  community group. We meet together in people   s homes every Sunday  night. I belong to a bible study group, we meet every Tuesday morning  at 6:45 in the morning. I just thoroughly enjoy it. It   s been a real  blessing to us.  Involved in any civic clubs, organization?  Not anymore. I used to belong to a lot of them. Of course, I was a  Rotarian for a number of years. I belonged to the Rotary Club here in  Stillwater. Then I moved to Oklahoma City and I belonged to a group  club called the Oklahoma City Executives Association. It was a  31  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  wonderful organization, belonged to it for a long time, served in every  capacity from all the officer   s chairs to directors to whatever. I   ve been a  member of the Oklahoma City Downtown Optimist   s Club. I was on the  board of directors of the Stillwater Country Club at one time. Was a  member of the   oh, another organization I   ve been very involved in is  the Jim Thorpe Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. I   ve been on that  executive council forever. I   m not very active anymore in it, although I  was inducted into the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame. Just a lot of  different organizations. The Olympic Festival, I was on the executive  committee for the   I believe it was 1989 Olympic Festival that we had  in Oklahoma City. I   ve been involved in a lot of different organizations,  a lot of different groups like Pension   Benefit organizations, Banking  organizations; again, there   ve been a lot of things. Anymore, my church  is very, very important and that   s basically it. Plus my tennis, I belong to  the Greens Country Club and I play tennis about three days a week and  thoroughly enjoy that. Play a little golf. We don   t hardly call it golf  anymore, we call it a social, because it really doesn   t look like golf the  way we hit it anymore.  (Laughs) As you viewed the university, gosh you   ve been affiliated since  the mid-   50s with Oklahoma State University. How do you feel about the  direction of the athletic program?  I think they   re doing a wonderful job. I think recognizing that you   ve got  to have the funds in order to compete. There   s a direct correlation  between the amount of money that you have and the success that you  have. That   s been true. Mr. Iba   s program might   ve been the one that  was a little different because he had so much success. Not in football  though. And I think not having the funding hurt the football situation. I  think the fact that we had to rely on outside guarantees from other  schools to provide a lot of the financing for OSU   s athletic program, I  think that hurt us. I remember one year Jerry, and you were probably  playing when Cutchin was coaching and he had to play the Big Eight  Conference schedule, which is rough enough, and in addition to that, he  had to play Arkansas in Little Rock, he had to play Texas in Austin, and  he had to play Houston in Houston. Well, that   s brutal. Your football  team, if they can go through that kind of a schedule, and win, then they  really are something. That wasn   t a good situation to force all that on the  team, having to compete that tough.  Which I think I hear you saying is one reason we play Arkansas every  year, for example, a lot of people ask why wasn   t that a home and home  series.  Was the revenue. We needed the revenue.  32  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  They would guarantee us a little more than we could make playing here  in Stillwater. Is that correct?  That   s right. Very much more. Yeah, they   d more than double what we  could make at a home football game.  Well, speaking of arenas, what do you think about the facilities that have  been developed lately? Gallagher-Iba Arena and now the football  stadium and the proposed athletic village.  I think they   re terrific. They   re just wonderful. I   m so proud of the  facilities. Gallagher-Iba, it   s as fine a place to play basketball and to  watch basketball as there is in the country. Of course, it   s always been a  great facility, but not like it is now. And that football stadium, I am so  pleased to see it dressed up and look like it looks. You know, when  Terry Don Phillips was here he was advocating the Gallagher-Iba project  and I was trying to  advocate doing something to the football stadium .  We needed to do something with that football stadium, it looked awful.  And right now it   s a showplace. I   m so proud of it and proud to see it. I  hope we just continue. I   m pulling for this indoor practice facility  coming on. I think that would really be beneficial to football and all the  athletic programs to have a facility that you could practice when the  weather   s bad.  Dick, are there some special memories you have of your time at OSU as  a student-athlete? I mean you   ve had a long history, a long relationship.  Were there some special times that you recall?  Oh I   ve had so many special times.  Any of them stand out in your mind?  Oh gosh, I remember winning the Bluegrass Bowl. I remember very  significantly winning the National Baseball Championship, although we  didn   t realize how significant that was at the time. You know our  philosophy was we liked to play. We liked the game, we liked the  competition.  Bring    em on.  Bring    em on. We didn   t care who we played. And we had a saying, old  Bob Andrew was the one that coined it, when you thought about this  little old Stillwater, Oklahoma gonna go play Southern Cal or UCLA,  and we played all of them, we   d always say,    You know, there ain   t  never been a horse that ain   t been rode. There ain   t never been a rider  that ain   t been throwed.    If you line up against them, they put their pants  33  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  on the same way you do, then you got a chance to whip them. And we  whipped a lot of them.  (Laughs) You did. Well speaking of whipping a lot of them, I understand  that this is your 50 year reunion?  Fifty, yes. Fifty years since the 1959 National Championship.  Coming up here, is that exciting for you?  Oh, it   s very exciting, yeah.  You were a pitcher, correct?  Yes.  When you weren   t pitching did you play a position? Were you a position  player at all?  No, I didn   t. None of us did. I did in high school.  Now obviously you started, did you relieve some in those days? Did you  do both?  We had a pitching staff so we didn   t need much relief. We really had a  good pitching staff. Joel Horlen, he went on to pitch for the White Sox  for a long, long time. Joel was a terrific starter. Roy Peterson was  another right-hander that was a terrific pitcher. I come along and would  hold up my end. And we generally played a three-game series on the  weekend   that   s kind of how we played. We didn   t play nearly as many  games then. Thirty games was probably the tops that we played.  Where did you pitch in the rotation?  I was the third game. I pitched the third game.  Do you remember that season what your win-loss record was?  I don   t know. I hadn   t lost a game until we got to the College World  Series. I remember that very vividly. I was probably 7 or 8 and 0. I was  undefeated. We   d been beaten a couple of times, but I had never lost a  game. In fact, I didn   t lose a game my sophomore year nor my junior  year. In fact, the first game I pitched they took me up to Manhattan  against Kansas State. I didn   t know what was what up there and I think I  shut them out and I hit a grand slam home run.  34  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Do you remember what your ERA was in the    59 championship season?  Well, that was what was so significant. The three pitchers, the ERAs  were all under three runs a game. So we didn   t give up many runs and  that   s the reason we didn   t need a lot of relief pitching. When you went  out there you were usually out there. But we had good defense. We had  good defense behind us, we had good pitching, and we didn   t need a lot  of relief. And that was one of the things that really, really came home to  roost in the College World Series. We   d won the first couple of games  and I was pitching the third game against the University of Arizona and I  hadn   t been beaten, and OSU hadn   t been beaten in the tournament  either, and I got beat. Oh, I sure didn   t enjoy that.  What was the format? Obviously it was double elimination tournament?  Double elimination.  And how many teams made it to the college world series?  I don   t know whether it was eight or ten. And it was double elimination.  Did you come out as two separate pools and then the winners would  play?  Yeah, that   s kind of how it was set up. But Arizona beat us. You had to  play several games in row coming up. And we played our way back  through the loser   s bracket. I believe San Jose State was the West Coast  champion or the team that represented the West Coast and then Arizona  was also in there and they were both undefeated. And then I don   t know,  somehow or another they met and knocked each other out and we  worked our way back through the loser   s bracket. We were about out of  pitching and we were going to play Arizona in the finals. We had a little  left-hander named Toby Bensinger. I   ll bet Toby hadn   t pitched ten  innings all year. He was a good pitcher. We had some other good  pitchers, but they never got a chance to pitch because we didn   t play that  many games and the pitchers that were the starters just didn   t lose,  hardly. But we were out of pitching. It was about two nights after I   d  gotten beat. So Toby  Greene  had to start Bensinger. And what a great  job he did. Toby went in there and pitched I think the first three or four  innings and we were just nip and tuck. I forget what the score was. But  then it was either the fourth or fifth inning, they put me back in to  relieve. And again, Arizona had beaten me, the only loss I had in  college, and I really hadn   t lost a game in high school either come to  think of it. So I got a chance at Arizona again.  You had a little motivation? (Laughs)  35  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  I shut them out. I shut them out the rest of the way.  Did you get the win?  I got the win.  You were the winning pitcher in the national championship game?  I got the win, but Toby deserved it. You know, bless his heart, he did a  wonderful job.  As I recall, you lost 5 to 3 against Arizona the first time and then won 5  to 3 in the finals, does that sound about right?  I believe that   s about right. When I came in I think we were tied. I think  it was 3 and 3 when I came in and we shut them down the rest of the  way.  Who got the winning RBI, do you recall?  No I don   t. I should recall, but I don   t.  I   m sure somebody at the reunion will know, right? (Laughs)  Oh, they   ll know  Yeah. Well,  Roy  Peterson will know. He   ll know  everything, Roy was our captain and he was     At that time you didn   t have post-season terms. You just had to win the  conference. How did you play your way into the World Series?  Oh no, now, we had a playoff. That   s another story. There   s too many  stories, Jerry. You know, we won the Big Eight. And we had to play the  champion of the Missouri Valley, and that was Bradley. So we had to go  to Peoria. The way we travelled was in cars. We had some of the  players, if they had a car that didn   t have bald tires on them, who would  drive. And, of course, Coach Greene would drive his car. And I don   t  know, we   d take four or five cars, and that   s the way we travelled.  Coach Greene would give us meal money. I think we got  3.50 a day  and that was our meal money. You   d go eat wherever you could go buy  a hamburger or whatever. But we had to drive to Peoria and we had to  drive by way of St. Louis. We drove to St. Louis and stayed all night in  St. Louis and then drove to Peoria. Well, we got there and played  Bradley and we beat them in a double-header.  Was it best out of three?  36  Soergel  It   s two out of three, yeah. We beat them double-header. So we got  ready to come home and we drove back to St. Louis. And, of course, we  were all pretty happy. We were all kind of celebrating. Some of us went  down to some of the local establishments in the downtown St. Louis area  and we were celebrating a little bit. Well, my celebration didn   t last very  long, because I didn   t have enough money to celebrate very long. I  decided I   d go back to the hotel room. Well, I went back to the hotel  room and went to sleep. I was awaiting a wake-up call the next morning  because we   d always get up early and we   d always be on the road by  about 7 o   clock. My brother was my roommate. Well, he was one of the  celebrators, and he and a carload of them decided they   d go over to East  St. Louis. Well that   d been one of the places that Coach Greene said,     Now whatever you do, don   t go to East St. Louis     Well, they went to  East St. Louis. While they were there they got their tires slit.  So I   m in the hotel asleep and my brother, and I don   t know, there were  three or four of them in that car. They were trying to get their tires  repaired so they can get back to the hotel so Coach doesn   t catch them  being out late. Then they   ve got to drive home the next day. Well, to  make a long story short, they never got back to the hotel. They just  basically took that group and left and went home. Well, everybody  thought I was with him and there I was asleep in the hotel room. I woke  up about 8 o   clock and got up, thought man it   s late, what   s going on, I  don   t know where everybody is. I called the hotel desk and said,     Where   s the Oklahoma State baseball team?    They said,    They left  about 7 o   clock.    I said,    No, they wouldn   t leave me.    (Laughter) I got  dressed and I went down to the hotel lobby and started talking,    Oh  yeah, they left about 7 o   clock.    Jerry, I didn   t have a nickel in my  pocket and there I was in St. Louis. I didn   t know anybody in St. Louis  and I was kind of shocked. So I talked to the hotel manager and I said I  need to make a telephone call. So I called back to Stillwater and tried to  call Mr. Iba, probably glad I didn   t get a hold of him, he wasn   t home,  but I did get a hold of Cliff Speegle. He kind of laughed about it and he  said,    Well, I   ll wire you the money and get on a plane. Fly in to  Oklahoma City.     So he wired me the money there and I got a plane ticket and I got on a  plane and flew into Oklahoma City. Well, all the baseball team arrived  at Gallagher Hall after their drive back from St. Louis and they started  counting noses. And they said,    Well, where   s Dick?    and they said,     Well he   s with you.    And they said,    No, he   s with you     And to make  a long story short, they didn   t know where I was. And my wife didn   t  know where I was. She was with her folks in Oklahoma City. Byron  Bird was our trainer, you remember Byron. Byron called Gwen and said,     Have you seen or talked to Dick?    No, she hadn   t talked to me. I hadn   t  called anybody. I was in the process of catching that flight and coming  37  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  on to Oklahoma City. No one knew where I was. I can remember my  wife ended up calling Byron back and saying,    Well you know, you  guys better find him  You took him up there     And Byron, in his  congeniality, said,    Well, who do you think I am, the FBI?    It ended up  being kind of a funny story and it all turned out good because when I got  into Oklahoma City I called my wife and she said,    Where are you?  Everybody   s been looking for you.    And I said,    Well, I had to catch a  plane home to Oklahoma City.    But anyway, that   s another one of those  trivia stories that took place.  We   re talking about what we call the Road to Omaha, nowadays.  Uh-huh.  So you beat Bradley in a double-header. Did that get you to the College  World Series?  That got us to the College World Series.  So there   s eight different regions of the country? You cut them on your  district or your regional?  That   s right.  Now what was the atmosphere like at Omaha? Was it like now? Was it a  big deal in those days?  It was a big deal in those days. People in Omaha really did support it.  They would assign some group to take care of each team. And they were  more or less your sponsors. They would take you out usually to some  kind of a feed one night and really treated you good. The crowds, they  absolutely supported that tournament. That stadium was Rosenblatt   I  believe was what it   s called   Stadium was packed with people and they  loved that baseball. The baseball was good. You know, college  baseball   s good to watch. It was really well-supported.  Well, do you have some special memories of the College World Series?  Of course, you were talking about the games you pitched in, obviously  we talked earlier about the two Arizona games and the championship  game winning was big. Are there other things you remember about the  College World Series?  Not really specifically. I just remember how we always hung in there.  We would maybe be behind in a ballgame and our team just never ever  gave up. There would always be somebody come through. It wouldn   t be  the same guy. As we used to tell, somebody   s got to pick it up.  38  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Somebody   s got to pick us up. And I can remember Grayson Mersch  was our first-baseman, maybe as good a glove man as you   d ever find,  but not a good hitter. A couple of ballgames I can remember where he  hit one out of the park. Bruce Andrew was always a dangerous hitter.  My brother was an outstanding hitter. He had a whale of a College  World Series. He did really a good job of hitting. We just had different  people that came along. It was a true team. James Dobson, he had a  phenomenal series. He was voted the outstanding player in the College  World Series. I don   t know what he hit up there in that series and he  played third base and made every play. It just fit together. But again, it  was a team that played together. Ray Bond was our catcher, a fine,  terrific catcher. Bennie Bancroft played center field and, boy, he was a  terrific center fielder. And Connie McIlvoy was a walk-on. And Connie,  he played left field and just did a superb job. Tim Green was another  outstanding player. Tim and my brother would alternate quite a bit or he  and Connie would alternate. They were all outfielders. Somebody would  always come along and pick up the team when they needed them. It  wouldn   t be the same person.  So now you pitched two games and in those days the pitcher hit for  himself, right?  Yes, oh yeah.  How did you do, did you get some hits in the College World Series?  I don   t remember whether I got any hits in the College World Series, but  I was a good hitter.  What was your batting average, do you recall?  I don   t recall what it was, but you know I could hit. My first year in high  school I hit .400. The summer after I graduated from high school, I went  to Liberal, Kansas to play in the Ban Johnson League in the summer. I  started out being a pitcher and we didn   t have enough hitting so they  moved me to third base and I had to clean up for the Liberal Ban  Johnson team. So I was always a pretty good hitter.  Did you jack any out your senior year?  You bet. I could hit one out. (Laughter)  Okay, how special is it for you to be part of the only OSU baseball team  that won a NCAA championship?  Well, I think it   s very special to be a part of it. I   m just amazed that  39  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Oklahoma State hasn   t won more championships with as good of  baseball teams as we   ve had. But everything has to work right. And  that   s what I   m saying, our team had the chemistry. It fit together and  things worked out, just really worked out right.  You think about Chet Bryant, he got to the finals one year as a runner-up.  Of course, Gary Ward got there two or three times and runner-up,  he got into the finals but never got there. So out of all those years and  the great teams that we   ve had, the great players, the Robin Venturas, et  cetera, the 1959 team was the only team that made it all the way.  I know it. I know it. You know, I pitched   I played for another team, a  semi-pro team, and we won the National Championship in 1964 in  Wichita. I got to pitch the final game in that one too, got the win.  Two national championship game wins   So, it was chemistry again. We had a team there in Wichita and I was  living in Stillwater at the time and almost everybody on that team played  in the big leagues. We had a great semi-pro baseball team. But I was  fortunate enough to get to pitch the final game.  Well Dick, speaking of different eras and teams, how do you think the  1959 team ranks in relation to some of the outstanding teams in the  Gary Ward, Frank Anderson eras?  Oh, I doubt if the    59 team would stack up on an individual basis. But on  a team basis they would, because they pulled together so much. Athletes,  on an individual basis, I would say Horlen would stack up with any of  them. Because Joel, I mean he had a slider at that time that was really  good, and he also kept the ball down. And that was one of the things that  we worked at. You didn   t give hitters a good pitch to hit. Make them hit  it on the ground. Keep that ball down around the knees. It was also a  different era in baseball where we didn   t mind intimidating hitters. It  was pretty much a given that if you got two strikes and no balls on that  batter, you were going to knock him down. That was just the way the  game was played. If a guy hit a home run off you, if he came up the next  inning, he was going to taste the dust. You were going to back him up.  That   s the way we played the game and there wasn   t anything wrong  with it.  Also you didn   t have helmets. Nobody wore batting helmets, just had the  old baseball cap. The hitters knew. They knew it was part of the  intimidation of the game. You   d get some hitter and you   d watch him.  He   d get up to that plate and he   d start digging in and trying to dig those  spikes in there and making a big hole he was going to stand in. Well,  40  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  you   d loosen him up a little bit. Didn   t mind dusting him off. It was just  that was part of the way the game was played. All of our pitchers, they  didn   t have any fear about knocking batters down. Generally, if you   d  knock a batter down and he   s up there and next pitch you   d throw that  curveball low and away, he has a hard time chasing it.  He   s leaning back a little bit, isn   t he?  It   s not easy. It   s not easy. And we had pitchers, all of our pitchers had  good control. We didn   t walk a lot of people, didn   t put people on. And  had good defense behind us. But as far as if you   d take individual  positions,    59 team I doubt if it, there   s not a Robin Ventura or there   s  not a  Pete  Incaviglia on there. But they were all good. See we had a  number of guys that signed professional contracts.  Which ones were those?  Well, Dobson signed, Bond signed, Mersch signed, Peterson signed. We  had a lot of them that signed contracts. Probably the guy that   and I  don   t know what happened to Dobson, because when he was a junior or  a sophomore in college I mean he was absolutely terrific and all through  college, but something happened to him later, might   ve been football.  He tried to play football, might   ve been that he got his shoulder hurt in  football. But I thought he   d make it to the big leagues because he was  really gifted. That   s another thing, Jerry, we had four guys on that  national championship team from Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma  City.  Really?  Yes. See, I was from Capitol Hill, our catcher Ray Bond was from  Capitol Hill, James Dobson was from Capitol Hill, my brother Don was  from Capitol Hill. Then we had two from Stillwater, Bob and Bruce  Andrew played short and second, they were Stillwater guys. Connie  McIlvoy, he was from Southeast in Oklahoma City. Toby Bensinger was  from Midwest City. Grayson Mersch was from up around Grand Lake.  We were Oklahoma kids. Bancroft was a Texas boy. And Horlen was  from San Antonio. But the rest of us were just little Oklahoma kids that  just liked to play. And we played hard.  Was Horlen the only one that made it to the pros?  Made it to major leagues. Yeah. He   s the only one that made it. Bond  had a good chance, he signed with the Cardinals and was doing pretty  good but he happened to come along right at the time Tim McCarver  was playing in front of him and he couldn   t push McCarver out. And  41  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Dobson, now I don   t know what happened to him, something happened  that he just didn   t hit like he did as a youngster.  Did you ever think about baseball as opposed to trying pro football?  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I wasn   t sure what I was going to do,  whether I was going to sign a baseball contract or a football contract.  Did you get an offer?  Not really. I wasn   t going to sign a baseball contract unless they paid me  good. And I told them that. Because I didn   t want to kick around in the  minor leagues. It wasn   t worth it to me. If you had a chance to go right  to the big leagues it   d be fine. But I had too many friends that played  class D league, class B league, class C league, and that wasn   t any kind  of life, and again I had a family. I was interested in my family, interested  in supporting them. I wasn   t going to do that. I didn   t have the greatest  speed. I could throw fairly hard but I wasn   t just overpowering. Old  Mickey Cochrane told me one time, Mickey Cochrane was a long-time  Hall of Fame catcher, he was a scout, I forget who, I used to talk to a lot  of scouts, he said,    You know, you need to develop one more pitch.    I  never had the time to really work on developing another pitch. I was  always doing too many other things. And he was right. I had a good  fastball. I had a couple of curveballs that I threw, but I needed one more  pitch. I needed to learn how to throw a knuckleball, or a slider, or a  sinker. Sinker would   ve been the pitch. But I never worked on it.  And so I really thought I   d make the football team, because I could  throw the football even though I hadn   t thrown drop back passes and  such. I could throw the ball. I thought I could make that football team  and I was disappointed that I didn   t. In fact, the coach, when he cut me, I  was very disappointed because I   d talked to him earlier, I said,    You  know, if you   re going to cut me I need to know early because I   ve got a  family. I need to take care of them and I   d like to go someplace       and  he said,    Oh no, we   re going to keep you.    Until we played the last  exhibition game and that was right before the season started and if you  played, if you were there during the season then they had to pay you  what your contract said. So that   s when they cut me and that   s when I  said,    You know, professional sports is a pure business.    And that was  it.  Have you followed the baseball programs in the years since here at  OSU?  I followed them certainly when Chet  Bryant  was here because I was  still part of the university and then when Gary Ward came in I followed  42  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  Gill  Soergel  them some. Not nearly as close. You know they play so many games  anymore, I don   t know how they go to school. See that   s one of my  concerns about baseball. I   ve always been an advocate of trying to move  college baseball to the summer. I think it should be played in the  summer.  Gary Ward felt that way too, didn   t he?  I think to some degree he did. To play enough games, you need to play  in the summer. And there needs to be some way to finance it. I think  Gary had a plan as to how to do it, but he couldn   t get enough support to  get it done. But I don   t know how these kids can play 50 and 60 games  in the spring and go to school and make their grades. And to me,  education is just too important. That   s the reason I came to college. I  wanted an education. Again, I   m grateful that I had that opportunity and  that Oklahoma State did give me a good education. I felt like I got a  good education here.  What do you think about Frank Anderson and the team nowadays, the  program? Have you had a chance to watch some of the games under  Frank?  I think he   s going the right direction. I think their pitching is getting  better. That   s the disappointment that I   ve had with OSU   s baseball is  their pitching. They give up too many runs. With Gary, when Gary Ward  was here, their hitting, they could score runs, but their pitching was  suspect. And then when  Tom  Holliday took over, same thing. I thought  when Frank came in, he was touted to be such a fine pitching coach at  Texas, I thought we   d really, really do a lot better pitching. Last season  they started doing better pitching, and I hope that continues this year.  Because I   m a great believer that if you don   t give up many runs, you   re  going to be in the ballgame. And there   s something about that pitching  and defense, that   s just absolutely important to me.  It is. Kind of winding up here, I   m thinking of Dick Soergel the football  player, the basketball player, the baseball player, the student athlete, the  business manager for 18 years. A lot of people know you and through  the years, how do you want people to remember Dick Soergel? How do  you hope they   ll remember you?  Oh, that   s a hard question. I would probably say I   d like to be  remembered first of all as someone that kept his word. I don   t know of  anybody I   ve lied to, and that may be to a fault. I   d also like to be  remembered as being a friend. Someone that takes care of their friends.  I   d also like to be remembered as a husband and a father. I think those  43  are the things that I   d like to be remembered for.  -------  -------
