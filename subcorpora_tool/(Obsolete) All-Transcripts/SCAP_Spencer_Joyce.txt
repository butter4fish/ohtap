SPENCER:		Here, support my bad knee—wait a sec here.

DUNN:	This is Sarah Dunn, and I’m conducting an interview with Joyce Spencer, Class of 1961, on May 21, 2011, for the Smith College Alumnae Oral History Project.  Thank you for agreeing to be a part of this project.

SPENCER:	It’s fun to be here.

DUNN:	So we’re going to start out talking a little bit about why you decided to come to Smith.  It sounds like your mother was a Smithie.

SPENCER:	Well, since I just mentioned my mother, who was certainly an influence, and had a couple of really good Smith friends all her life.  One of them was from Hannibal, Missouri, and her family was very active in preserving a lot of the things related to Tom Sawyer and the whole, you know—that part of the Twain tradition and heritage.  And then I went to a small private girls’ school in New Haven.  The heads of the school were two Smith graduates, and my favorite teacher was the Math teacher and she was another Smith graduate.  She was [Amy Alvord Borst?], and I have no idea what class she was in, but I would say she died about ten years after I got out of high school, so I think she was fairly elderly when she was teaching us, although now that I think about it, she was probably under 70, and I’m 71 (laughs).  So, anyway, that was a big influence—having those teachers, and the heads of the school were, you know, very good examples.  And I think my mother—well, we lived outside New Haven, so Smith was very close.  And I had never been away to school, and I think I thought it would be fun to go to a college that wasn’t too far away.  And in those days you really didn’t apply to many colleges; you applied to maybe three schools, and got into all of them or two of them.  And I’m sure that my mother definitely was pushing me a little bit.  And in those days you did what your parents told you, more or less.  (laughs)  Or if you thought they’d enjoyed it you tried it too.  So—

DUNN:	What was the campus atmosphere like here, during that time?

SPENCER:	Ah, atmosphere.  I don’t know, just very congenial.  I think we were all pretty serious students, as Jules said today in that wonderful talk she gave us, You come from a school where you’re the top of your class, or second or third, and then you get here and find you’re just maybe in the middle because everybody else has been the top of their classes, and they might have been in much more difficult high school environments.  I think we studied hard on weekends when we were here.  We didn’t go away and date that much—at least not as much, maybe freshman year.  We had restrictions on getting off campus, the parietal restrictions—I think you were allowed maybe two weekends a semester.  When I think about it now, it just seems, you know, our daughters would never have stood for that.  And I think what I really enjoyed were the singing opportunities.  It was always a strong college in promoting the Arts.  I knew the Art History program was wonderful, but I tended to take a lot of Music courses.  I studied Voice—one of my favorite teachers was my Voice teacher, and [Adrienne Auerswald?] and I used to visit her every reunion, and unfortunately she’s passed away since my last reunion.  And I think, I think it was—well it would be what I would imagine a girls’ boarding school atmosphere would be now.  And I think all of you who have graduated more recently are more citizens of the world than we were, really.  It was much more cloistered, you know.  You had hours you had to be in early on the weekends—I don’t know, eleven, twelve o’clock.  Say goodbye at the door.

DUNN:	(laughs)

SPENCER:	There was a lot of protection; it wasn’t all bad.

DUNN:	You had House Mothers–

SPENCER:	House Mothers who were very diligent, were on the spot.

DUNN:	What house did you live in?

SPENCER:	I started in Ziskind.  It was brand new, we had—they put in a very good senior class, so that it would get off to a good start.  I guess they made it sort of an honor to come into Ziskind for your Senior year.  And a very nice House Mother.  I had lived in a 250-year-old house, so to be in a modern dorm was kind of fun.  Now it looks to me a little bit rundown—I mean, the architecture from that period doesn’t always hold up.  But it was great.  But actually after a couple of years I got very friendly with a girl I met freshman year.  We were each head of a freshman choir.  Do they still have Choir A and B?  They had two freshman choirs then, and then they had a sophomore chorus and then the Glee Club.

DUNN:	You know a lot different singing groups.

SPENCER:	Yes, yes—well, aside from the small groups.  So I got friendly with the girl—I was Choir A; she was Choir B—and after two years, two of us decided to move to Laura Scales, and we had more friends there so—and that was kind of fun to move.  I think now they move almost every year, or not?  Am I wrong?  Or do they stay in the houses?

DUNN:	Some of them—depends on the house community and how they feel—yeah, they’ll move around a little.

SPENCER:	I did feel, one of the reasons I moved—and I’ll just be frank about that—I thought there was a rather clique-y group in Ziskind in my freshman year.  They were primarily girls from Boston (laughs) who always sat together at meals.  And if you came into the dining room and there was an empty chair and you might think you’d go there, and then you’d look around and say, Oh I wonder if they’re expecting so-and-so.  So I’d go sit somewhere else.  But I found a very welcoming group over at Laura Scales, and was very happy there the last two years.

DUNN:	How did you feel as the (inaudible)?  Did you feel accepted very easily?

SPENCER:	Oh yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody’s very friendly.  We always said hello—you know, pass on the—I don’t know if people still do that, but, yeah, when you’re—it’s nice.  In fact, I find that in Maine—we’ve retired to Maine, from Connecticut—I’ve spent my whole life in Connecticut until the last five years.  And people say hello to strangers in Maine on the street, and it’s very much like being back at Smith.  (laughs)

DUNN:	Did you notice any tensions around religion, class, race, sexuality?

SPENCER:	Not really about sexuality, we were all before that.  One of the things I was thinking about last night—I mean, we were naïve.  And, and if there were people who felt that they preferred other women, we just, I don’t think, knew about it.  And they probably didn’t understand it.  The two women I was talking about—who were head of my girls’ school—lived together, and I think probably had a pretty serious relationship.  And one was quite a bit older than the other.  She was actually the Headmistress, and her partner, her friend, was the Assistant Head.  And when Julia Thomas died, Edith Blakely—who was the Assistant—she hung herself in the cellar stairway.  And—I mean, it really just, you know, it got—and I don’t think she was sick, I think she was just so lonely without Julia.  And they were both Smith graduates, and I wonder what their life was like at Smith.  So there are many things that I think have improved.

DUNN:	Yeah.  Was there a lot of issues around class or race or–

SPENCER:	We had so little—I don’t think around class.  And maybe girls who were here on scholarship might have said something different.  But I think since you all had jobs in the kitchen—and some of the girls had scholarships had jobs like working in the music library or something of that sort—they, I don’t know, I don’t think, I don’t think we did.  And as far as race, we were very homogeneous.  Florence Mwangi was our only black classmate.  I have another very good friend from the class—we were both freshman song leaders—and she’s light, lightly dark-complected.  (laughs)  And her background is Cape Verde.  And my grandmother lived in New Haven, and I used to go down occasionally for dates for football weekends, and I’ve have friends come with me.  And I asked Laura [Pyrees?] if she’d like to go with me.  And I got her a date with a black football player.  And it never occurred to me that she really didn’t have anything in particular in common with him, because their backgrounds were totally different and I was so naïve I just sort of assumed, Dark complexion–dark complexion.  I mean, and I’m embarrassed to even bring it up with her now because it just seems so (laughs), so naïve, and—I don’t know.  I did ask her once if she knew what happened to him, or, you know, what he did in his—and she sort of said, “Oh, no, like, I wouldn’t have followed up!”  And then I realized the blunder I’d made, probably.  I don’t know.

DUNN:	It was a different time.

SPENCER:	And as far as religion goes, I think probably the Jewish girls felt a little different.  You’d have to interview—I’m sure you have interviewed some of them.  I don’t think we treated them any—you know, I mean—or they treated us—whatever.  I’m sure we could have filled the whole class with smart Jewish girls just as, you know, future generations could fill the whole class with smart Asian girls.  I’ve heard since then at reunions from some of the Jewish girls in our class that they think there was a quota.  I don’t know if there was.  I was from New Haven from a university community, and my father was a faculty member at the medical school, and we had, you know, Jewish family friends and stuff, so I never really thought much about it.  But I think they probably did.

DUNN:	Could you talk a little bit more about the clubs and organizations you were a part of?  You mention singing–

SPENCER:	Singing was fabulous, and what I didn’t realize is the effect it would have on my future.  Because I married a fellow who is a good tenor, and about 13 or 15, maybe 15 years ago, Yale started an Alumni Chorus, and their first trip was to China, and I said, Oh Jim—he’d got something in the mail because he’d been in the Yale Glee Club, and they were only taking people—at that point they didn’t even take Whiffenpoofs, because some of them hadn’t been in the Glee Club, because the Whiffenpoofs was such a, you know, a big commitment.  So, you know, the price was right, it was fairly reasonable, and just exciting—a chance to go to China.  And I think he was still working but he had enough vacation time.  So that has turned into, every three years, a major singing tour.  And we sing with the symphonies in their countries—it’s a very big deal.  We do a lot of rehearsing—a lot of rehearsing with discs at home, and then we have to go to New York for rehearsals once a month when we’re approaching a concert tour.  We’re going in about four weeks to Turkey, Armenia, and Georgia.  But the China trip as followed three years later by a trip to Mos–, to Russia, to take part in the White Nights thing in St. Petersburg, their summer program in Moscow, and we went—before we went to Russia, we started out in England.  And we went to Wales and participated in the [Ystedftd Clangocchlyn?], where I had sung as a chamber singer after my freshman year with Iva Dee Hiatt’s chamber singers.  And after I graduated from Smith I kept in touch with a family—we all stayed with families in Wales—and I got somebody in the community where we were singing to drive me to her house—she had lost her husband in the meantime—it’s a little mining town.  And she didn’t know I was coming, and it was incredible.  Winnie Pemberton.  And she died two or three years later; now I’m on email with her daughter, who travels a lot, comes to America a lot, but she doesn’t want to come to Maine yet.  She goes to places like Florida, Disney, Las Vegas.  They did go out west and see some of the National Parks last year, but I know I’m going to meet her soon.  And she was a cute little girl of about four or something when I was singing.  But anyway, so this singing groups has taken us also to South America, to South Africa—it’s fabulous.  And that was all because of singing seriously at Smith, in the Freshman Choir and on.  And then with Ivadi who was incredible.

DUNN:	So did you just mainly do the choir each year?

SPENCER:	Yes, I tried out for one of the small singing groups.  I had sort of hoped I’d be tapped for the Smiffenpoofs, and it didn’t happen.  So in my Senior year I tried to get into one of the others, I can’t remember what it was.

DUNN:	Was this the a cappella groups?

SPENCER:	Yes, I mean, I would have done that along with the Glee Club.  And they kind of like to take sophomores and, you know, progress.  And I tried out and thought, I think I’ll get it.  But they said, Joyce, your voice has too much tremelo, you’ll stick out.  So I didn’t (inaudible) (laughs), but I survived.

DUNN:	(inaudible) Glee Club, and Chorus, and all those–

SPENCER:	Oh yeah, and occasionally I had a small solo in the Glee Club, so that was fun.

DUNN:	What’s happened since Smith, and since you graduated, other than the lots of traveling you’ve gotten to do and see?

SPENCER:	I started out as a teacher, you know.  A lot of people have talked about how—I mean, I was really the end of that generation where you sort of worked until you had children, and then you maybe became a volunteer, and that’s pretty much what I did.  I taught English and some general Science, and then I ended up having three daughters, and did a lot of substitute teaching.  And I ran a program at the Audubon Center in Greenwich.  Studied Chinese brushwork.  Did a lot of Smith stuff, you know, Secretary–

DUNN:	Of your class?

SPENCER:	Yeah, not, yes—or, for the Greenwich/Stamford Smith Club, which was about 300 people, very active.  And, I think I was their Secretary, their Treasurer, their, you know, whatever.  Never was their President.  By the time I might have been President, I had a feeling that my daughters were tired of hearing about Smith, and I may have ruined it for them, because I couldn’t even get them to come for an inter–, or to look at the campus.  At that point, one of them—the oldest one—had been in a girls’ school, and she said she wanted to go to school with men for college.  And the other two had gone to Andover, and they were very used to being in classes with boys, and they said, We’re going to have to go out and compete with the other half.  So they sort of wanted to go on to co-ed schools.  And I’m sure it probably broke my mother’s heart, and I was disappointed, but who knows?  I have a granddaughter, maybe she’ll come.  (laughs)

DUNN:	We’ll get her.  (laughs)

SPENCER:	There was one in the parade today who’s in fourth grade, and was with her mother from my class.  It was really cute.  But, so I would say my life has been, you know:  homemaker, try to be a good mother, try to be a good wife, do my community service.  I miss teaching, and I thought seriously of going back to teaching after the third child.  There was a ten year gap between the second and the third child.  I really sort of wanted to have a boy, because we lost boy twins—the reunion of my, my fifth reunion was the only one I haven’t (inaudible/break in audio) for getting emotional—the only one I didn’t get to.  Anyway, so in my fiftieth reunion book, I put a picture of my middle daughter, who had twin sons.  And I always said, Kate, you’re having my babies (laughs).  Anyway, so we had the third daughter, and she has turned out to be terrific—she’s a doctor, she’s a doctor in Western Alaska.  She’s married, she’s only 32, she has three little boys.  I don’t know how she does it.  I know she doesn’t keep a clean house (laughs) and she’s gone down to four days of work a week, but I’m so proud of her.  And I think one thing I’d like to say is that, I had a doctor father and I was quite interested in Science, although I majored in English and I didn’t take much Science here.  And my father knew that there were really only one or two women in medical school each year at Yale.  And even in my husband’s class, and he would have graduated in about ’62, I think.  And my father said, You know, Joyce, it’s a hard life for a woman.  If you want to have a family, you’re just—you know, you’re good at English, you’d enjoy teaching or whatever—which I did.  But boy, I married a husband whose mother was a PhD from Yale—that’s where she met her husband—and God knows when she graduated, a long time ago—she was born in 1898.  And she had a sister who was a doctor, and she was a PhD in English, and her husband was in Philosophy, so she had a teaching career.  And so I married a husband who was very open to women doing whatever they want to do.  And after we had the third daughter—and as I say, there was a ten year span from the first one—I didn’t know really whether I wanted to go through cleaning up the floor with all the food (laughs) after two- and three-year-olds’ dinners.  He said, Joyce, if you’d like to go to medical school, I really, I’ll support you.  You know, you can—but I figured I would need so many difficult courses at that point.  The Chemistry, and I was 32 or something when Margaret was born.  And, so then I thought of going back into teaching, and when I looked into that, by the time I would have to pay childcare, you know, to somebody at home or to put Margaret someplace—and the taxes—I figured out I would have made $3,000 a year for, you know, a teaching job.  And I just decided even though I would enjoy it, it wasn’t worth it.  So I would keep on with the substituting and the Audubon work, which I really enjoyed.  But I’m so glad that things have changed, and when Margaret went to medical school, women were more than 50% of the class.  (emotional)  And she’s in family medicine, and that’s what’s going to get us through Obama’s Medicare, Medicai–, whatever (laughs).  His program.  And women are also now, I think, the majority in law school.  Excuse me, I’m very emotional.

DUNN:	That’s OK.

SPENCER:	Smith has a way of doing that to you.  I think of opportunities missed (crying), and I’m glad you’ve all had more chances.  But I’ve had a wonderful life.  I don’t regret any of it.  But I definitely was at that—I think, I think I would have enjoyed being a doctor.  Or being a teacher, more full-time.  But I didn’t want to get—I thought if I got an au pair, it would be like having a daughter in high school, somebody I’d have to look after and make sure she was okay emotionally and having a decent time, if she was from another country, which she probably would have been.  And I didn’t want to have an American helper in the house who might boss me around.  You know, sometimes you get help, and the mother’s hardly the mother anymore, because she has to do what the help wants her to do, or whatever.  So I just decided I’d stay home.  And actually my daughters now say, You know Mom, we miss the sit-down dinners.  One of them is—well, the doctor daughter—I think actually in Alaska, because they live in a 5 or 6,000 people town—but it’s very interesting, it’s a native [Yupik?] community, 85% Yupiks.  And they don’t have a huge social life, so their family unit’s very important.  And her husband is a very, very good house-husband.  He’s a teacher now, but he was home for a year with their first child, and he’s a great cook, and he does almost all of the cooking, which is a big help for Margaret.  And then the middle daughter is a teacher at Choate, and she was sought-after by a lot of, like Andover and Exeter and blah blah blah.  I was very proud of her.  She taught at Lawrenceville first, and then wanted to move closer to where her family were up north. And she and her husband, the only place where they could get a job together was at Choate, and they’re very happy there.  But it’s not quite—well, you know what the Andover atmosphere is.  It’s a great school.  And they had gone to Andover so that’s kind of why she wanted to teach there.  But they try to have a sit-down dinner,  And the only daughter who fails at that, pretty much, is the one who doesn’t have a full-time job and is at home in Westport, Connecticut.  But her husband works in Armonk, New York, and it’s a long commute, and so, you know, before he gets home—but I think that’s a real loss, and I find that happens in a lot of families, that sit-down dinners just don’t happen much anymore.  And, anyway, so, I mean, I’m not a mover and shaker, but, you know—

DUNN:	That’s OK.

SPENCER:	And I wasn’t going to do this until I came here to hear Susan Van Dyne, and I thought well, I’ll do this for my mom.  (laughs)

DUNN:	We appreciate it.

SPENCER:	Thanks.

DUNN:	Thank you so much.

SPENCER:		Thank you, Sarah.

GEIS:			Very original. (inaudible)

SPENCER:		Oh, thank you.  (laughs)

DUNN:		You know, people don’t–
