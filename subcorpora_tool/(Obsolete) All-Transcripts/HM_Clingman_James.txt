Story_ID: 260396
Speaker 1: Now this section of the interview focuses on your family background.  And first, I'd like to ask if you would please tell us about your mother.  What was her name and where was she born?
Speaker 2: My mother's name is Verline Clingman--well, Greene at the time.  She was born in Salem, Virginia, and left there at a very young age and moved to the Beckley, West Virginia area, lived in a small town called Helen, West Virginia, which is not even there anymore.  It's a coal mining town, and they called it the hollow, one of the hollows that they lived in.  And she grew up there with her uncles and grandmother [Minerva Dow] and, and siblings in that coal mining town.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, was there a very large extended family there?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, aunts, uncles, cousins, siblings, mother [Mabel Greene], father [Charles Greene]--the whole, the whole deal.  Back then, coal mining was the occupation that, if you wanted to make a living, that, that was it in West Virginia.  And all of the people lived in this one small town--of course, working for the mine, and dealing with the company store, and living in the company's houses, and the whole, the whole ball of wax.
Speaker 1: Did your mother ever tell you any stories about growing up in West Virginia?
Speaker 2: Oh, yes (laughter), a lot of stories.  One that sticks out of my mind is that even though they lived in Helen, West Virginia, a kind of a remote place about--I guess it would be about 20, 25 miles [sic. 15 miles] south, I think, south of Beckley.  Quite interestingly, bands and orchestras used to come through there and play at this big music house or, or banquet hall that they had there.  And she told me that she saw Cab Calloway.  I think she said Ella Fitzgerald came through once; Fats Waller, people like that.  So, she had a pretty interesting childhood in that regard.  She also had a very, a very close relationship with her uncles who, I'm told, spoiled her and, and gave her pretty much of everything she wanted.  She was the oldest of her siblings and she had a good relationship with her uncles.
Speaker 1: Now, did your mother have a lot of brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: She had two brothers.  One died in child-, well, he was, he was young, I think, five or six years old, and three sisters--
Speaker 1: Do you remember their--
Speaker 2: --so, there were five of them.  My uncle that's still alive, his name is James Greene, and her three sisters, two of whom have, have died, Arlene [Greene Ames] and Rometta [Greene Griffin].  Rometta lived in Cleveland [Ohio] when she died, and Arlene lived in Los Angeles [California].  And her youngest sister, Lois [Greene Burks], is still alive.  She lives in Richmond, Virginia.
Speaker 1: And so, all of them, then are coming of age in that coal mining town--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in West Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes, except for my uncle.  He said he wasn't about to work in the coal mine, so he left at an early age to join the [U.S.] Army 'cause he just was afraid.  He said he was afraid to, to work in the coal mines 'cause my great-grandfather had his leg cut off working in, in the coal mine.  A car ran over his leg and he had a peg leg, so my uncle was deathly afraid of going into the coal mine, so he said he left.  He got out of, out of Beckley, and went into the Army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your mother attend the public schools in West Virginia?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, graduated from a high school that is still having its reunions.  The name of the high school is Byrd Prillerman [High School, Amigo, West Virginia], and I understand, historically, Mr., or Dr. [Byrd] Prillerman ended up being the president of West Virginia State University [sic. West Virginia Collegiate Institute; West Virginia State University, Institute, West Virginia] and Institute, West Virginia.  It has a significant history--that high school does, and they still have reunions.  My uncle still goes to their reunions.  They're only a few of them left, but the school's not there, but they still have their reunions.
Speaker 1: So, is that a historically black institution?
Speaker 2: Yes, it's, it's a high school and, of course, it was, it was primarily black--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --back in those day.  You know, it was segregation and all black.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Was that true of the demography of the town as well, or was there a racially mixed population--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --and just segregation in the school?
Speaker 2: --oh, yes, it was basically separated by poor, by the haves and have-nots, for what I remember going down there.  There were whites who lived there, as well in the hollow, but they worked for the mines and everybody was, you know, on the same level.  But, of course, in the education system, it was different.  But from what I remember, the, the community was a mixed community.
Story_ID: 260397
Speaker 1: Do you remember your maternal grandparents?
Speaker 2: Yes (simultaneous).
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Did you ever meet them?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  My grandmother's name was Mabel [Greene] and my grandfather's name was Charles [Greene], and they lived in Beckley [West Virginia].  And I remember going down to their, to their house in the summertime.  And I remember all the chickens running around the yard, and how we would eat, have chicken, even for breakfast, you know, and how my grandfather used to pray these long prayers before we could eat (laughter).  And I'm sitting there (laughter)-well, when is he going to get finished, you know, I'm ready to eat.  And my grandmother--I'm told by my mother [Verline Greene Clingman]--was, was very, what can I say?  She was special, especially in her relationship with us as children, as her grandchildren.  Unfortunately, she died at a young age, about forty-eight years old, in West Virginia around 1953.  So, I didn't spend a lot of time with her, but we used to go down in the summers.  I remember at least two or three summers, we went down to spend with them.  So, it was, it was, it was a good time.  They had their own home, a lot of land, and this was in the early '50s [1950s].
Speaker 1: Now, when you say, you used to go down, was that for a family vacation or would you spend the entire summer?
Speaker 2: My brother [Charles Clingman] and I would go down--my oldest brother would go down, and spend the summer in West Virginia and in North Carolina sometimes with my father's [James Clingman, Sr.] parents [William Clingman and Sarah Clingman].
Speaker 1: Now, when you were on the farm in the summer, did that mean you, you became a farmer for the season or how'd that go?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, I guess you could call it that.  I used to pick apples and plums off the trees, used to feed the, the hogs that my grandfather had on my father's side, feed the chickens, go in the chicken coop and get the eggs, collect the eggs.  I did whatever they asked me to do--chop wood, go to a well, and, and draw the water out of the well.  So, I did, I did a lot of things, yeah.
Speaker 1: So, it sounds like both of your parents then came from rural backgrounds (simultaneous)?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)  Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, or small town at least--
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right, right.
Speaker 1: --farming communities.
Story_ID: 260398
Speaker 1: What was your father's name?
Speaker 2: James [Clingman, Sr.].  He was the oldest of eight, and born in Clemmons, North Carolina, small town again, outside of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.  And his father and mother, of course, had a farm as well, and we would stay there sometimes in the summer.  His father grew peanuts.  He had a smokehouse.  He had the well, he had the chickens, and the hogs, and the cow and, you know, it was--and fruit trees, and it was just a country experience.
Speaker 1: And you said your father is the oldest of eight?
Speaker 2: There were eight, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: There were one, two, three, four--four boys and four girls.  One of the brothers died at an early age, but the rest of them lived to be quite--matter of fact, his sister, one of his sisters is still living.  She's ninety-six years old.  And the rest of them died like 95, 93, and they lived, they lived to be at least in their nineties.
Speaker 1: Now, you said you were able to spend a substantial amount of time with your grandparents in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Um-hum.
Speaker 1: Do--you remember their names?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Will was my grandfather--William [Clingman], they called him Will.  And my grandmother's name was Sarah [Clingman].  And we would go down in the summer to spend time with them, then they would leave us there.  My mother [Verline Greene Clingman] and father would take us down and leave us there for a couple of months.  And it was quite an experience to grow up and to see, to remember now--look back now to see how they lived with the, you know, the coal, the stove that you have to put the wood in, and to cook the food, and take the bath in the, in the tub on, on Saturday night, and the lanterns.  And the well, we had to get the water, and of course, the outhouse (laughter), that you had to go outside to use the bathroom.  I mean, it was--I, I experienced that and I thought it was fun.  My brother [Charles Clingman] didn't like it too much.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I thought it was a lot of fun.
Speaker 1: Well, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], for the students of history who view this video, they may not know--
Speaker 2: Oh, okay (laughter).
Speaker 1: --about those (laughter), those innovations.
Speaker 2: Yeah, what--outhouses (laughter)?
Speaker 1: I mean, how much detail would you like to share since this is your story?  Do we need to go into details so students will know what an outhouse was for?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, an outhouse was a, a bathroom--well, it wasn't a bathroom.  It was just, it, it was a toilet, and it was nothing but a hole in the ground with, you know, the seat and everything where you had to go, and that's where you had to go.  Of course, at night, they would have this container that they would bring into the house if you had to relieve yourself if you didn't want to go outside.  And that's, that's, that's basically what it, it was--no flusher, no anything (laughter), you know.  And every now and then, they would come and put lime--I think they would put lime in it to keep it functional.  The, the other thing, the smokehouse thing, people may not know what that was, but my grandfather had a smokehouse.  He would kill hogs, and in order to preserve the meat, they'd pack it in salt and, and to preserve it.  And then they'd hang it in, in the smokehouse, and leave it there.  I, I don't know how long he left it there, but I remember going in there and see these hams hanging up.  And apparently, that cured it and, you know, it was country ham then.  So, they, they were very innovative.  Of course, people had to be back then.  They didn't have the refrigeration.  They didn't have the electricity and things like that, and the running water, so it was a lot of innovation going on back then. And I remember my father telling me once about when he was chopping wood and he cut his toe.  And he went in the house and the toe was bleeding and, and I mean, split open.  And his grandmother--I mean, his mother, my grandmother, put spider webs on it, cob webs on.  I said what?  He said, yes, she reached around and grabbed, you know, and put in there.  And when I got older and I took biology, I--oh, that, that made sense because I learned that the blood clots like a web, and how would they have known that?  I don't know, but as he said, that's what she, what she would do.  And they, they were very, very smart back then, you know, a lot smarter probably than we are today.
Story_ID: 260399
Speaker 1: Now, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], you've described, with a smile on your face, experiences in the rural South in the absence of electricity and indoor plumbing.  And I take it, they were very pleasant for you--
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --in the middle of the 20th century?
Speaker 2: Yes, I--like I said, I, I thought it was fun 'cause I grew up in Cincinnati [Ohio] and, of course, we had all those things.  And so, it was kinda--well, it was a different experience and it was fun to me to be in, in a place where you had to use all those other kinds of things--the stove and the wood, go outside, chop the wood, bring it in to cook.  And the ice cream, we used to make ice cream on the porch.  My [paternal] grandmother [Sarah Clingman] and she would cut up the fruit, and we'd sometimes have bananas and sometimes have pineapples, and make our own ice cream with the churn, you know, the thing you had to turn with the ice and the salt on it and all that, so it was, it was fun for me, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm wondering then if, if life in the South was, if not easy, at least pleasant, or a lot of the times, why your parents [Verline Greene Clingman and James Clingman, Sr.] chose to migrate north.  Did they ever share those stories with you?
Speaker 2: Well, my father left--he left home when he was nineteen years old.  I think he said about nineteen--eighteen or nineteen years old.  And he just wanted to get away, and he moved to Cincinnati to stay with one of his uncles who lived here.  And he never went back home.  He was the oldest, like I said, and I guess he just felt like he wanted to just get away.  And he had an uncle living somewhere so he, he struck out on his own, and stayed here since that, that time.  My mother met my father--it, it was really a strange relationship because my father's sister married my mother's uncle.  And they got married before my parents did, and they introduced my mother and father, took him down to West Virginia because my mother's uncle, obviously, was from Beckley [West Virginia].  And they took my father on a vacation with them down there, and that's where he met my mother.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So, when did the family actually establish a permanent home in Ohio--your parents?
Speaker 2: I think they moved here in 1943, 1943.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's just before you were born?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And did they ever say what it was about Cincinnati that really attracted them and, and this is it?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the big city--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --it was the big city.  I remember my father telling me about how he used to take my mother--he wanted to take her on a date, and he couldn't wait to take her down to the train station.  I don't know if you know anything about Cincinnati, but Union Terminal [Cincinnati, Ohio] is a famous train station.  And he, he told me about the first time he took her down there.  I was driving around one day.  It was, it was later in his life and he was telling me some things.  He said, yeah, we--I took her out and we went down there to the train station.  I said, to the train station?  That was his date, you know, and but it, back then, the train station had a lot of activity.  It had a lot of things to do there and you just watch people.  And, and I remember they had some, some arcade games in there as well.  So, I guess that was a big date for them, and but it was just a big city.  He, of course, had, had to find work and he, he worked at a dry cleaners, a huge dry cleaners--I remember as a night watchman when we were growing up, and just did whatever he had to do, you know, to take care of his family.  And I remember her telling me back then that he made thirty-five dollars a week, and there were four of us at that time--four siblings and my great-grandmother [Minerva Dow] lived with us.  She lived with us until she died.
Story_ID: 260400
Speaker 1: So, what are some of the earliest memories that you had then of growing up in Cincinnati [Ohio] with the other siblings in the household?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Well, people may find this different being in Cincinnati, but there were five of us.  Four of us were born at home in, right, right in our, in--where we lived.  And my great-grandmother [Minerva Dow], who's my mother's [Verline Greene Clingman] grandmother, had a hand in delivering myself and my older brother [Charles Clingman].  And I remember when my second youngest brother [Anthony Clingman] was born.  I remember seeing my mother in the bed, and them handing the baby to her.  And I didn't--I thought the doctor brought the baby and, and gave, and gave it to her, but I remember seeing that, and he, laying there with her.  And I was about five years old at that time.  But those are, you know, memories that stand out because I, I think--well, I know that it, it provided a closeness, a family closeness, in that regard, and we were primarily raised by our great-grandmother.  She died at age ninety-two in 1972, but she lived with us and took care of us while my mother and father [James Clingman, Sr.] worked.
Story_ID: 260401
Speaker 1: And I remember my older brother [Charles Clingman] and I would, you know, just be out in the streets playing, going places, discovering things, and doing things we shouldn't do, and all of that.  My sister [Mabel Clingman Turner] primarily stayed at home and, 'cause there were four boys and one girl, and just did the things that, that kids do, you know, living in the West End of Cincinnati [Ohio], which is primarily where most black people lived back then in the last '40s [1940s] and early '50s [1950s].  Going to school, getting into trouble, getting into little fights at school, you know, what we thought were big time things.  But we were just normal, you know, just what we considered normal--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --living on the block, and all the kids on the block knew each other.  We knew all the families.  We'd go to eat at different people's houses in, in the afternoon and the evening or whatever, and we looked out for each other.  We had our, our little arguments and spats, but it was, it was basically a good, a good time.  I mean, we never looked at it as it's-oh, I can't wait to get away from here-- and that kind of thing.  I, I never remember, I don't remember any time that we ever did that.  It was just--we did what we did, we had what we had, which was not much, but we didn't, didn't really have any, any problems when it came to money.  And, you know, we don't, didn't have it, so you don't miss what you didn't have, you know, what you, what you don't have, so it was just a good childhood.
Story_ID: 260402
Speaker 1: There were some, I think, I wouldn't call them problems, but what's another word?  I don't know. The relationship that we developed with my great-grandmother, of course, caused us to be different from the way it would have been had our mother [Verline Greene Clingman], my mother and father [James Clingman, Sr.], you know, would just stay without her 'cause she had a great influence, not, not only the children, but on the whole family--my great-grandmother did.  So, it was a lot of things that she brought from her thinking and her upbringing, which she was born in 1880, and--
Speaker 2: And what was her name, please?
Speaker 1: Minnie--Minerva, really, but they called her Minnie, Minnie Dowe.  And quite, interestingly, her married name was Taliaferro, which is the middle name of Booker T. Washington, and she married a Taliaferro out of Virginia, which is, which is where Booker T. came from.  So, I always tell people I may be related Booker T. Washington.  But her name was Minerva Dowe.  Her first husband died.  I think he got, he got killed by an accidental shooting and when he was hunting or something.  And then, she married a Taliaferro, and adopted two, two boys.  And she and my mother were real close because my mother was the first sibling of her daughter, Mabel [Greene], and she kind of took my mother and raised her.  You know, back then, they would--oh, I'll take that child-- you know, that kind of thing so.
Speaker 2: So, informally adopted then?
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.
Speaker 2: Okay, by her grandmother.
Speaker 1: So, my mother moved here.  She came with her and stayed until she died.  We all lived together.  She lived in my mother's and father's house until, until she died.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  And you said your great-grandmother was a mid-wife?
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: Was any formal training for that or just other women in the community?
Speaker 1: No, no, that I, no, just there, yeah.  We have a cousin, my mother's sister, Lois [Greene Burks], had her first child in West Virginia.  And I remember them telling me about this that, of course at home, the baby was born.  He was real small--I mean, premature, and they said you could hold him right in the palm of your hand.  You put a handkerchief on him for a diaper--that kind of thing.  And the doctor told her, he's not going to make it--just, you may as well just put him over there and just let him, you know, go to sleep and, and die.  Right now, he, he lives in Beckley, West Virginia, and he's my age.  He's about a year younger than I am.  He's retired--a fire chief of Beckley, West Virginia.  And my great-grandmother told him, told the doctor when he was born, when the doctor told her was there's no hope.  She said, now give me that baby.  And she took care of him, nursed him, and, and like I said, the rest is--he's still, he's still living, you know.  So, that's the kind of, I think, I don't know, intuitive, intelligence, raw knowledge about life that our, our ancestors and elders had that we should appreciate.  They knew a lot of things back then that some people are struggling with today.  So, that, you know, I have a lot of memories about, you know, having grown up with her, her telling us the stories about her young age, and how she dated guys.  We used to sit around and listen and laugh about that, you know, so it was, it was a very interesting, interesting childhood.
Story_ID: 260403
Speaker 1: Now you said there were--you had four siblings?
Speaker 2: Yes, one sister (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)  Growing up in the household with you?  And--
Speaker 2: --one sister, three brothers.
Speaker 1: And their names, please?
Speaker 2: My oldest brother is Charles [Clingman], and my sister came after me.  I'm second, and she's third.  Her name is Mabel [Clingman Turner]--they call her Candy.  She's named after my grandmother [Mabel Greene].  And then, my brother, Anthony [Clingman], and then the youngest brother, Curtis [Clingman].  He was the only one that was born in a hospital 'cause he came along.  We call him the accident 'cause I was almost fifteen when he was born.  I was fourteen years old, going on fifteen, and we all understood what was going on then, you know.  But my father [James Clingman, Sr.] was fifty-seven years old when my, when my youngest brother was born.
Story_ID: 260404
Speaker 1: I wanted to ask also about other institutions.  You, you already talked about the role of the extended family and mother wit for medicine and other matters--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --that had to be dealt with in your home.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: But I'm wondering also about schooling, and perhaps involvement in the church.  Was that also important?  Was education a priority--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --for your parents [Verline Greene Clingman and James Clingman, Sr.] and great-grandmother [Minerva Dow]?
Speaker 2: --yes, yes, yes, we could not miss school.  We got up every morning, and my great-grandmother was there, and she fixed us cereal, breakfast, whatever, and it was off to school.  I hated school.  I didn't want to go.  I remember going to kindergarten and wouldn't take my coat off.  The teacher had so much problems and she had to call my mother, and I didn't want to be there because I wanted to be in my brother's [Charles Clingman] class.  He was a year ahead of me.  And I remember a recess.  We would come out, and then you had to line up, and go back into your class.  And I would always get in his line, and try to sneak back in his class and go with him.  I just did not want to go to that school, didn't want to be there by myself.  And they had a rough time with me in the kindergarten, but as I progressed, you know, I kinda got a little more independent.  But, yeah, we had to go to school, and it was, it was--I mean, no question about that.  The church, yeah, we had to do that, too.  Every Sunday morning, you know, we had to go to church.  We were going to a church close to where we were, so we walked.  And Sunday school, we had to participate in the little activities that the kids did--my brother and I primarily--'cause my sister [Mabel Clingman Turner] was much younger at that time.  But we had to do the speeches, you know, Easter and Christmas, that kind of thing, stand up before everybody, and give your little speech.  And it was, it was--we had the full experience.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the name of that church?
Speaker 2: Revelation Baptist Church.  It's still in Cincinnati [Ohio].  It's about, oh, maybe nearly a hundred years old now and it's still, still here.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And how about that school that you hated so much in the early years?
Speaker 2: Heberle [Elementary] School [Cincinnati, Ohio], it's still here.
Speaker 1: And I'm sorry --
Speaker 2: Heberle--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --H-E-B-E-R-L-E, one of the oldest elementary schools that is still open here in Cincinnati, but I went to kindergarten there in 1949.  And the kindergarten teacher, Miss Jones [ph.], she was there up until about 1980, '79 [1979] or '80 [1980], and many, many kids went through her class.  And it's, it was, it was quite an experience, but after I got out of the kindergarten and went to first and second, third grade, I, I was okay.  But I hated to go into kindergarten--I remember that today.  I remember it, I didn't want to go into that school (laughter).
Story_ID: 260405
Speaker 1: Now, you said you became more independent over time--
Speaker 2: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: --and separated at least from your brother [Charles Clingman]?
Speaker 2: From my brother, right, right.
Speaker 1: Do you remember what kind of student you were in elementary school [Heberle Elementary School, Cincinnati, Ohio]?
Speaker 2: I, I--up until, I guess, the last twenty years or so, I remember seeing my report cards.  I got good grades.  I remember getting A's and Bs.  I don't remember a lot of S-minuses.  That's what they used to give us--S's and S-minuses and S-pluses.  I remember a lot of that.  In elementary school, I did great.  When I got to junior high school, it was, oh, it was quite different (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh.  So, what happened in junior high to change things?
Speaker 2: I was--I guess rebelling or rebellious--didn't want to go to school.  Seventh and eighth grade was okay.  New experience when I got out of sixth grade, did well, got into the ninth grade--oh, didn't want to go.  All I wanted to do was work 'cause I had worked ever since I was ten or eleven years old.  I had something that I was doing for--to get paid, 'cause if we needed, if we wanted money, we had to do that.  And when I was in the ninth grade, I worked two jobs.  I got up at three-thirty in the morning and delivered papers.  When I got out of school, I had another paper route in the evening.  On the weekends, I worked at this grocery store, and it was always--I was trying to find something to do to make money.  And, of course, I had to buy my own clothes, my own shoes, and things like that.  And it got to the point, that's all I wanted to do.  I said, I don't want to go to school, you know, I didn't know what I was talking about back then, but I, I was out more than I was in.  And I would get in trouble, rebellious to the teachers, you know, they wanted to disciple me.  I know you're not going to discipline me.  I would leave, you know.  It was, it was rough, it was rough times.  And I got expelled from, from school in the ninth grade, and I spent more time out than I did in.  And they held me back in the ninth grade.  So, they called it back then, you know, I stuck in the ninth grade.  So, I, I had to get it together after that.
Story_ID: 260406
Speaker 1: All right.  [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], at the end of the last segment, you began to tell us about your entering the world of work--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --in junior high school.  What do you think was the inspiration for that?  Did that come from your hard-working parents [Verline Greene Clingman and James Clingman, Sr.] or your hard-working [maternal] great-grandmother [Minerva Dow]?  Where did that come from?
Speaker 2: Well, it, it came probably more from necessity.  There were things that I wanted and if I had, if I, if I were to get them, I, I knew my parents couldn't give me everything I wanted.  But, you know, so I, I worked, and I didn't enter it then.  I, I really worked as early as about ten years old.  I used to load trucks, you know, Cincinnati [Ohio] is famous for breweries.  There were a lot of breweries.  And there was one down the street from where we lived, when we lived in the West End [Cincinnati, Ohio].  And I used to go down there in the evening and, and just ask the man if I could help them.  And we'd load these, these cases on, on the, on these rollers and push them into the truck.  And they'd give me thirty cents or something like that.  And, of course, I'd go down to the train station [Union Terminal, Cincinnati, Ohio], and put it in the arcade so, you know.  But I've, I've been used to working virtually all my life.  In the ninth grade, though, it--I was being paid a little bit more, five dollars a week, nine dollars a week, you know, paper routes and grocery stores, and, and cutting grass and raking leaves.  And anything I could do, I would go out and, and try to make some money.  And it just got to me to, to, it got to the point where I said, I, I could do this, you know.  And I'd wash cars, detail cars, and, and I just, I just liked to work and liked to have my own money, and liked to buy my own clothes and things like that. So, it kinda overtook me as far as, you know, the balance between working and going to school.
Story_ID: 260407
Speaker 1: So, I would just not perform well in school and 'cause I always wanted to be somewhere working.  And that's kind of how, interestingly enough, that changed my life for me.  And I, I, I had to do the ninth grade twice.  I had to go to summer school 'cause I didn't finish my algebra class.  And it was just, it led to a lot of other issues in my life, you know, a lot of hanging out on the corner with the guys and doing things and being involved in some, in some juvenile delinquency things.  And even to the point where a friend of mine and I, my best friend and I even call ourselves running away from home once when we were fifteen years old.  I turned sixteen on the road, on a bicycle trying to ride from Cincinnati [Ohio] to St. Louis, Missouri.  We packed up and had backpacks, had saddle bags on the bike for a little food, canned goods and stuff.  And we were going to leave because, you know, the--we had been, I guess I could say this on, on the t- video that we used to go to this car lot, this used car lot on the weekends, and just walk around, look at cars 'cause everybody wanted to drive then, you know.  We were 15--14, 15, 16.  And we'd go to this car lot, and look at these cars on Saturday.  And then Saturday night, we would go and take whatever car we wanted and, and we would start the car with chewing gum paper 'cause back then, you could just take some foil, and stick it under the starter, and the car would start.  And we would just drive it off the lot and keep it for that next day, that Sunday, and take it back Sunday night, and just park it right back where it was (laughter).  And, of course, nobody would call that car theft back then (laughter).  We were just using the car, you know, but we did that and, finally, it caught up with us.  And we got in trouble for it, of course, and we knew we were going to get in trouble because we had to go to juvenile court for it.  And he and I decided--well, we have to run away (laughter), so we got our bikes and, and left.  We stayed for about two and a half days and spent two nights out in the woods sleeping and, you know (laughter), came back home.  And the police were looking for us and everything.  And his mother turned him in, and my mother [Verline Greene Clingman] turned me in.  My mother and father [James Clingman, Sr.] took me up there the next morning to juvenile, and had to go to court with the juvenile court judge and all of that.  And I was, again, rebellious.  I wasn't going to call him sir and I wasn't going to speak properly.  And he--I remember that morning, he brought me out, and they were going to have my little hearing, you know.  And I wouldn't call him sir.  He, he said, "Take him back in there, put him back in there, leave him there until I tell you to bring him out."  He said "You're going to stay in there another ten days."  So, I was actually in a, in a juvenile detention facility here in Cincinnati.  And he was just angry with me 'cause I was just, I would just not give him, you know, the respect that he, he deserved as a judge.  So, he told me, he told my parents, he said, "I'm going to send him to," what they call back then, "Boys Industrial School [Lancaster, Ohio]."  He said "I'm going to send him there until he's twenty-one."  That would have been five years in reform school.  And my parents talked with the minister at that time, and it just so happened that the minister--his nephew was my probation officer.  And he talked to him, and they talked to the judge, and they brought me back out.  And, and they had arranged that I could leave--rather than go to boys' school, to leave and go to Winston-Salem, North Carolina to live with my aunt, my father's sister.  And that was the best thing that ever happened to me (laughter) in my life.  From that negative experience came this positive experience, this turnaround point that had I not taken advantage of that, this--I probably would not have finished high school.  I don't, I don't know if I'd even be alive because three of my best friends got, got killed, you know, out there in the streets and doing things.  So, that was a negative experience going into a very positive experience--moving to North Carolina.  And they didn't allow me to go home, say goodbye to my brothers and sisters, or nothing.  They picked me up from the juvenile detention center, had my little suitcase, took me right to Greyhound [Lines] bus station (laughter), and I got on the bus.
Speaker 2: And your parents--
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had to do it that way.  And he said, you cannot come back to Cincinnati.  You cannot come back to Ohio for a year--couldn't even come home.  Of course, I sneaked back six months later (laughter) for Christmas, I think it was.  It wasn't six months, but I came back for Christmas just briefly.  But went to live with my aunt in North Carolina.  And my life turned around from there and started going back up again (laughter).
Story_ID: 260408
Speaker 1: So, you attended high school in North Carolina the year you were away?
Speaker 2: Yes, went to high school at [John W.] Paisley High School in, in Winston-Salem [North Carolina].  And this was in 1960 when I went down there.  It was five--three months after the, the Greensboro [North Carolina] sit-in restaurant, Woolworth['s; F.W. Woolworth Company] sit-in.  And, of course, I didn't, I wasn't aware of that.  I wasn't active in that.  And then, I was only sixteen years old.  But I went to high school at Paisley, the tenth and the eleventh grade.  And before I left, this is an interesting story as far as education goes, especially based upon what, what I'm doing today.  I left the high school [Winthrow High School; Winthrow University High School] here in Cincinnati [Ohio] that had probably three thousand students in it, and went to a high school in Winston-Salem that only had, in the entire high school, 225 students.  And I'll show you some photos of--I still have one of the albums.  But that experience caused me to, to do more and to be better because here, in Cincinnati, all I did in high school--I mean, in junior high school, was play basketball.  That was it.  I was just a number and another student, you know.  But when I went there, you know, your teachers, the teachers cared--I mean, they were not going to let you fail.  My math teacher lived across the street from me.  And I was not only playing basketball, but ran track, played other sports--student council, honors, National Honor Society, Spanish club president, all kinds of, then science club, all kinds of things I'd never been involved with.  I did it and, and it was, it was just the beginning of, of a very positive experience for me that saved me really, saved my life.  I came back to graduate from high school here.  And that, that decision was made, you know, for various reasons.  But when I got back here, I went back to the high school that used to put me out all the time.  The principal was still there.  And when I came back, of course, they had to take my transcripts and everything.  And he--I remember him walking up to me one day in the hall and said, are you the same guy that left here in the ninth grade?  And, of course, he knew I was, but he was just asking.  I said, yeah.  And he said, with these kind of grades, 'cause I, I had, I was in the honor society and everything.  I never--it wasn't that I never could do the work.  It was that I just didn't want to be there.  And, and so, when I got back, he was impressed with that and I graduated top ten percent of the, of the class.  And, and I--it was kinda like me saying, I could always do this, you know, but I just, I just didn't.  So that was a proud, a proud moment.  I, I know from my parents [Verline Greene Clingman and James Clingman, Sr.], too, 'cause they, they probably thought I never would even (laughter) grad-, you know, graduate from high school.  But I came back to graduate.  And then, I went right back to North Carolina to go to college.  I went to college at North Carolina College at Durham [North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] for one year and that was a great experience as well.  I got, I sang in the choir, the college choir, which had a national reputation 'cause they would go on tour all the time.  And I sang in the choir with Maynard Jackson, and he was a first year law student and I was a freshman.  I didn't know what he was going to end up being then, of course, but I know I was very impressed with him 'cause he sang bass.  And he had this, this voice, and he used to read when we, when we would do our concerts, he would do all the reading parts and the narrative parts.  And I remember being so impressed with his, with his voice.  And he and I--I remember got stranded once in Washington [D.C.].  The bus left us.  We were on tour going up the East Coast to sing.  And he and I were in this restaurant 'cause he liked to eat, too (laughter), and I remember that experience with him.  There were a couple of other people in the choir.  One, Leon Pendarvis, he's the, he's the guy who has been on 'Saturday Night Live,' the pianist for 'Saturday Night Live,' for probably twenty years now.  If you ever see a guy playing, a little guy playing the piano, his name is Pendarvis, Leon Pendarvis, and we were in the choir together, too.  And he was a very, very good musician, even back then in the '60s [1960s] in North Carolina.  So, I, I met a lot of soon-to-be (laughter) famous, famous people, and I was very proud of that experience.
Story_ID: 260409
Speaker 1: Well, before we talk in detail about your experiences during the college years, I would like to go back to your high school years [at Winthrow High School; Winthrow University High School] in Cincinnati [Ohio], and, and especially the entrepreneurial activities--
Speaker 2: Ahh (laughter).
Speaker 1: --that you began to dabble in at the age of ten.  When you came back from North Carolina, did you go back to working--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and going to school?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did, yes, I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, you, you struck a balance--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --and excelled in school as a--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: How were you able to achieve it?
Speaker 2: I worked at a grocery store every day after school.  I had more than enough credits when I, when I was a senior.  I didn't have to stay in school all day.  I would get out at two o'clock because I had enough credits.  I would leave school, and go to work at this grocery store every day and on Saturday all day long.  And I would work, say, from three to seven during the week and then all day on Saturday.  And that's how I earned money, help, helped to help our family, too, because it was a grocery store that had produce and meats, and everything in it.  And, of course, I would get discounts, and I would like buy produce, greens and stuff to bring them home on the weekend to, for us, you know, to have dinner.  And it, it worked out well, it worked out well.  All--well, my brother [Charles Clingman] was work--no, my brother, I think, at the time had gone to the [U.S.] Air Force.  But I was working, and just trying to help out, and, of course, get the things that I wanted as well.
Speaker 1: So sounds like it's a very busy group of people in that family.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You said your mother [Verline Greene Clingman] is balancing, raising the--with five, four or five children?
Speaker 2: Five of us.
Speaker 1: Five--finally--
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: --children?
Speaker 2: Yeah, finally (laughter), right.
Speaker 1: And working outside of the home?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kind of work did she do?
Speaker 2: She worked at, at Good Samaritan Hospital [Cincinnati, Ohio] here in Cincinnati.  Before that, she worked in different people's homes taking care of their, their houses.  I remember one man that she worked for.  He was a rich guy--I mean he, and I remember going to his house sometimes.  Unfortunately, he was real short and had small feet, so we couldn't wear the clothes that he would, that he wanted to give to her to give to us (laughter).  But I remember going out there several times.  But she worked in several homes doing domestic things.  And she worked in the hospital, too.  Sometimes she worked two jobs.  I remember working, her working in a laundromat after she got off work from the hospital as well, just, you know, sitting there in the laundromat, making sure that everything's taken care of.  But, primarily, she worked at, at Good Samaritan Hospital for twenty-eight years.  She started out in the, in the kitchen making fifty cents an hour and moved--evolved through that, over the years, to make a whopping $4.10 an hour.  I remember that.  And she retired from there when she, she got sick, took on like, as her mother [Mabel Greene] did, became diabetic in her forties.  And it caused a lot of problems, so she had, she had to stop working.  But then, after she got back on her feet, she went back to work there, and then took a job at Sears [Roebuck and Co.] as a sales clerk.  But through the hospital, she worked in the kitchen, she worked in X-ray department, and then the last job she had was what she called cisto [ph.].  She worked as a, as an assistant in this department where they would do testing on internal kinds of testing in X-rays and things like that.  She put in twenty-eight years at the hospital, and worked other jobs as well along the way.  And my father [James Clingman, Sr.], at that time, worked at a place called NuTone which is still here in Cincinnati.  They make chimes, bell chimes, and alarms, and things like that.  And he worked in maintenance and janitorial, and retired from there.  He had a heart attack in 1968 and had to, had to stop working from there.
Story_ID: 260410
Speaker 1: So you're graduating from [Winthrow] High School [Winthrow University High School, Cincinnati, Ohio] around nineteen--
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-three [1963].
Speaker 1: --sixty-three [1963]?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Landmark year.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, you better believe it (laughter).
Speaker 1: And African American history, oh, and your history, too (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --but certainly--
Speaker 2: Yeah, '63 [1963] was, yeah.
Speaker 1: --for, for the larger African American community.
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: And did you have a sense of all the history was being made at that point in time?
Speaker 2: Not--
Speaker 1: March on Washington, any of that?
Speaker 2: --not really.  I was supposed to meet friends of mine from North Carolina because when I went back to North Carolina, it was, it was 1963, of course, before the march.  And I knew people there, of course, from high school who were at the North Carolina College [at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] a year ahead of me.  And I remember talking to a good friend of mine.  Said we're going to meet in Washington [D.C.]--you gonna go?  Yeah, I'm going.  I was back in Cincinnati [Ohio] for that summer.  And, unfortunately, I didn't get to go--couldn't afford it, didn't have the bus, you know, trip, and money and all of that, but didn't get to go to that.  But I remember it well--people going.  And then in, later on in that year, of course, I went down to, to North Carolina to go, to go into college at, at, in Durham [North Carolina].  And I didn't, I didn't make the march, but I certainly remember people going.  And, and, like I said, I was supposed to go, but wasn't able to.
Speaker 1: Do you remember in '63 [1963], so that would been end of August '63 [1963]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the reaction to the I Have A Dream speech by [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.]?  Was it immediate, or is that something we've given to the speech and--
Speaker 2: No, yeah, I think over the years, of course, we, we can look back and, and see how it has been elevated to what it is today.  But back then, the significance of it, as far as my age group was concerned, we really didn't--it really had no impact on us.  I mean, it just, it was a big time.  All the people were in Washington.  We wanted to be there just to be together, you know, it was more of a social kind of thing for us in my age group.  But I'm sure the, the people who were older, you know, they, they knew the significance.  It, it, it was certainly, like you said, a year, of course, the year that President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy got killed as well.  I remember walking across campus at North Carolina College when that happened.  I know exactly where I was, like everybody does if they, if the remember it--going to my French class.  And people were saying, the president got shot, and that was in November, of course, of '63 [1963].  So it was a significant year.
Speaker 1: I'm wondering, too, about another event from '63 [1963].  In September of '63 [1963] was the bombing of a church [16th Street Baptist Church] in Birmingham, Alabama--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and the four little girls.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And now, again, the young people--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --increasingly being caught up in the violence.  Did you recall the reactions since you were in the South--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --to that event?
Speaker 2: No, I don't remember a lot of conversation going on about it.  Of course, I was in North Carolina in Durham--they had, they had issues.  I remember the students going on marches, marching to Chapel Hill [North Carolina], marching to downtown Durham, and protesting, and doing all those kinds of things.  I never did participate.  They told me, based upon my attitude, that I probably should stay at the, at the school because they asked me to go once.  I remember they were going on a march.  And, and I said, what happens and what do you do?  They said, we're going downtown to go to this restaurant and they don't want us there.  And they told us everything to expect.  And they say, well, they may spit on you, they may pour some ketchup on you, or something like that.  I said, well, if anybody does that to me, I'm gonna fight--simple as that.  They said, well, you, you stay here (laughter).  I said, I'm not going to take that.  They said, well, you shouldn't go, so I didn't go.  I never did go on any of the marches--living there.  And as far as the, the incidents that took place, the church bombing, at that time, the impact was very minimal for me.  I was nineteen in North Carolina, first year in college, and you know, down there in, in September trying to get situated and everything.  And as I think back on it, I don't even know if we did anything--I don't remember.  You know, they would call you together, have an assembly, and talk about things--the president of the college would, but I don't remember that we did that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And we may have, but it's been a long time ago (laughter).
Story_ID: 260411
Speaker 1: Well, if we can turn our attention once again to your development as a young college student--well, outside of the Civil Rights Movement, but, again, you're eighteen, nineteen years old--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --and, and in college.  Are you working and going to school at that time?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't work in Durham [North Carolina].  I wasn't able to find anything to do.  And I, I certainly would have if I could have--I didn't know people there.  I knew people that I went to [John W. Paisley] High School in Winston-Salem [North Carolina], but that was it.  It was a new experience for me.  I, I just, I was there on campus, stayed in the dorm, in a room with two other guys in Chidley Hall, Chidley Hall, it's still there.  I went back a few years ago.  And I just got involved with the choir, did not join any of the fraternities or anything.  Again, because of my attitude, I, I remember seeing the morning after one of the initiations back, you know, back then, they had real initiations for fraternities.  And everybody would ask me, oh, you, you gotta go Kappa [Alpha Psi Fraternity].  No, you gotta go Que [Omega Psi Phi Fraternity], you know.  What is this, you know?  And one morning, I saw this guy walk down, walk across campus, and, and his eye was black.  And I said, "What happened?"  "Oh, I went through initiation last night."  I said, "What?  They, they did that to you?"  He said "Yeah."  And I said, "And you had to pay for that?" 'cause you have to pay like, back then, two or three hundred dollars to be, to get in-, involved.  I said, "Well, I will not be doing that (laughter).  If I had to go through that, I'm not going to stand, and let anybody beat on me."  I was just, I was just like that, you know.  And so, I ended going to the choir.  We had a one-day initiation.  It was a little thing where you had to do something for the upper classmen or something but, and stand on, in the quad, and sing for all the, the girls, you know.  And I said, I can handle that, you know (laughter).  So, that's what I, I, I did at NCC [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  Again, it was, it was a good experience--a small college about twenty-five hundred students and all black.  I think there was one--I remember there was one white girl on that campus.  She came from Iowa--I remember that.  She was the only white person on, on, on the campus.  And but that year, I, I only stayed there a year, but it was, it was just one of the best years in my life.  I, of course, loved to sing, and made the honor roll the first semester--five A's and one B.  And my aunt paid my tuition.  I didn't know how I was going to pay.  My, my parents [Verline Greene Clingman and James Clingman, Sr.] couldn't pay, but my aunt, my father's sister paid.  And the second semester, spring came.  And I took a lot of courses in what we used to call "railology"--sit on this rail, and just watch the women go back, girls go by (laughter), you know, and hang out at the canteen, you know.  And I said at the end of that quarter, after I dropped out of class and everything, I said, well, maybe college is not for me right now.  So, I, I left there, and eventually went into the [U.S.] Navy a couple of years later.
Speaker 1: But you said there were some pleasant memories.  Still are--
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: --I suppose, that you have of that first semester at least?
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah, oh, yes, yes, yes.
Speaker 1: --in North Carolina and college.
Speaker 2: Most--yeah.
Speaker 1: So, what are some of the sights, and in addition to the, the women (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --the sounds and the smells--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that remind you of those pleasant experiences in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Well, there's a place on Fairview Street.  We used to call it the canteen, I think, where we used to, to gather.  It was like a restaurant and everybody would go there.  You know, in every small town where there's a college, there's some place where people go.  I remember those times, walking up and down.  I remember going, you know, not having any money, or not having a lot of money, and going to the, to the produce store on Fayetteville Street to buy potatoes.  And we would bring them back to the, to the room, and cut them up and make fried potatoes, French fries.  That's, that's what we had to eat.  And we just had to fend for ourselves and do the best we could.  I remember walking around--I mean if I had a dollar in my pocket, that was--hey, I, I thought I was okay.
Story_ID: 260412
Speaker 1: I remember, of course, the, the choir.  We--I went on tour with the choir, and it was the first time I got to go to New York [New York], and I remember the first time seeing New York.  And I was just overwhelmed at the fact that I was in New York City looking at, you know, the Empire State Building [New York, New York], and that kind of thing.  So, I got that opportunity from being there [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].  And, of course, meeting, meeting people and, and it was just good to, to be there.  In a way, you know, I was homesick, wanted to get home [Cincinnati, Ohio], but couldn't come home.  It was just too far, but it was, it, it was a time that I had to adjust to, to being even more independent, and standing on my own two feet.
Speaker 2: May I just ask quickly about the choir's repertoire?  It, it's a black college in the South.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Is it primarily African American music that you're performing or just broad range of music?
Speaker 1: Primarily, we sang--I shouldn't say primarily--we did do a broad range of music.  We did, of course, the old gospel spiritual songs, "Keep your hands [sic. hand] on the plow, hold on."  But we did huge pieces.  We did [George Frideric] Handel's 'Messiah.'  It was recorded on, on a record.  We did 'This Christmas,' and I've forgotten what they called it--a four-movement narrative kind of thing that Maynard Jackson read the words and we sang.  I mean, we did a wide range of music.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Classical music, as well as gospel music and, and music that was en vogue at that time.
Story_ID: 260413
Speaker 1: And I also remember the food.  I would never miss a meal (laughter).
Speaker 2: With the choir?
Speaker 1: I intentionally--no, it, it--when I was at, at NCC [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: I would intentionally take classes, 8:00 in the morning, so I'd be up for breakfast.  I mean, they had the best food--breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  I remember that.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I had a good relationship with the people who worked in the cafeteria (laughter).
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, you remember the smells of the food--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --the sounds of the music--
Speaker 1: Yes, yes.
Speaker 2: --and the sight of the women?
Speaker 1: That's right, that's right (laughter).
Speaker 2: All right, okay.  I just want to make sure that we had that accurately recorded.
Speaker 1: That's right--not necessarily in that order (laughter), but you're right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Story_ID: 260414
Speaker 1: All right.  Now, you said you left college [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] at the end of that first year and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and where did you go after that?
Speaker 2: Came back to Cincinnati [Ohio] and got drafted that summer.  And this was in '65 [1965] and went down to take my physical.  Of course, [the] Vietnam [War] was going on, just started a few years prior to that.  And I remember this guy at the draft board telling me, oh, in July, you'll be in Vietnam.  And this was in April, I think, when I got drafted.  And I had to take the physical.  And I, I was like Muhammad Ali--Cassius Clay at that time.  I didn't have no quarrel with those Viet Cong.  I didn't want to go to Vietnam.  And I came back home, and I was talking to a couple of friends of mine.  And I said, we ought to, you know, we ought to go join the naval reserve [U.S. Navy Reserve], which was right here in Cincinnati, and they had a big reserve--I don't know, I don't know what you call it--a building where they, where they would meet and everything.  And we went down there and talked to them.  They say, "Yeah, you can join.  And you, you'll, you won't be drafted.  You won't have to go into the [U.S.] Army."  So, I say, hey, sign me up, 'cause they said if you come into the reserve, you only have to do two years active duty.  You go to boot camp for only two weeks, rather than thirteen weeks, and we'll give you a year deferment.  You don't have go until next year this time.  I said, "Hey, where do I sign," you know (laughter)?  So, I signed up for that--ended up going into active duty in the [U.S.] Navy in 1966.  I went to Norfolk, Virginia and got a ship called the USS Shenandoah, which is still there, I think, a destroyer tender.  And two months later, I was on my way to the Mediterranean.
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Had a good time over there, but I hated the Navy.  Being in it, I just didn't like it.
Speaker 1: Now, what was it--the discipline or the--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the--well, part, the discipline.  I, I still had my, you know, rebellious thing going on.  But during that time in the '60s [1960s], with all of the civil rights stuff, and all the racial strife and everything, the Navy was the last of the services to adjust and to change its traditions.  I was, I took all the tests before I went in, and I was recommended to be in personnel to do some administrative work because all of my tests showed that.  And I remember the first day walking on the ship, and giving the guy my folder, thinking he's going to, you know, look at your grades, your scores, everything's up.  He didn't even, he didn't even open the folder.  He just looked at me and said "Deck force."  And I said, "What's that?"  He said, "Deck force, that's where you're going to be working."  And I said, "You didn't even look, and my tests" said, you know, I should be on administrative whatever you said. He said, "I said deck force."  From that day on, my attitude was like, when do I get out of here, you know?  And going through that experience was--it was, it was, it was bad because, like I said, at that time in the '60s [1960s], it was still this racial thing going on.  And I was on a ship with 750 men--only fifty, about fifty which were black.  And we had issues going on from person to person sometimes.  And the authority over me--I, I, I was twenty-one at that time.  And a lot of the other people on board were younger than I was.  And they had tendencies to call us out of our names, and to say things that I wasn't going to take.  So, I was always in trouble, I was always in trouble.  I was on--they call it report, put me on report.  Almost the first day I came on, I was on report.
Story_ID: 260415
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], you were saying at the end of the last tape that you were in the [U.S.] Navy--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --during the Vietnam [War] era.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And that your ship [USS Shenandoah] went to the Mediterranean.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Now, exactly, what kinds of activities were you involved in there?  I know you mentioned deck duty--
Speaker 2: Yeah, deck force (laughter).
Speaker 1: --or deck force.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, what did that entail?
Speaker 2: It entails wh--swabbing or mopping (laughter), every day, five or six times a day, whether it needed it or not.  It involved painting and chipping, chipping and painting, where you chip the paint off the ship with a hammer and, and a little tool, and then have, we paint the ship.  And we would do that whether it needed it or not (laughter), and then we would take care of all of the infrastructure on the ship, the anchors and everything else, make sure that all of the things were working properly on the ship.  There was one gun on the ship.  We didn't have to do too much with that because the gunnery people did that.  But we just basically took care of the maintenance of, of the ship on the upper decks.  Down beneath, in the hole where, what we called the snipes, it were the engineers.  They never saw the light of day.  They'd be down there making sure the ship was running properly and taking care of the boilers.  But that was what I did initially.  I hated it--didn't feel like I was supposed to be there because my qualifications said I shouldn't be.  But I, I served for a few months in the deck force.  And then I was able to get a job as a baker and I learned how to bake bread.  I made bread for 750 men every night--loaves of bread, and we made cakes and rolls, and everything else.  And that was good duty, what they called good duty, because I worked at night and got to sleep all day if I wanted to--didn't have to go to work until, until night.  So, and from there, I worked in the laundry and the dry cleaner.  We had a dry cleaner on the ship as well, but laundry was good duty as well so, you know, I made out okay after I got off the deck force.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So, it's during the era of the Vietnam War, but you're not seeing host- or involved in the hostilities--
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: --on the battlefields of Southeast Asia?
Speaker 2: Right, right.
Speaker 1: But I'm wondering, was there any risks, any danger associated with being in the Mediterranean on that ship at that time?
Speaker 2: Being in the Navy and being on a ship, period, is dangerous.  If you don't watch what you're doing, you could, you could get hurt, or you could get killed.  We were on alert to go to Vietnam once but, unfor- fortunately, we didn't have to go, but just being in the Navy was a dangerous thing.  You had to pay attention to your surroundings, especially when you were in a storm, of course.  If you were tied up and there was a storm, you had to be careful because those lines that we use to tie the ships up were about this thick.  And when we tied the ship up, they would stretch and be about like that, and if they broke, and you were anywhere around, you could get cut in half, and you had to be real careful about that.  We were in the Mediterranean, there was a big storm, we were tied up, and there was a, a cruiser next to us.  And one of the, the men on that cruiser got his legs cut off because a line snapped, and he happened to be there.  They would tell you never to straddle, never step over the lines because they were stretched.  And you could get hurt with the anchor if you were doing anchor duty.  You could get hurt, of course, if you fall off the ship, playing around on, you know, on the side.  There was one sailor who, who was caught between what they call LS--LSD [landing ship, dock] or ship that would take us--a little boat that would take us into the shore.  He got caught between there and the, and the docking point, and was crushed.  So, it's very dangerous to be in the Navy and, and to be aboard ship, and you had to deal with the psychological issues as well.  There were suicides.  There was a ship that was tied up to us in Naples [Italy] where a sailor committed suicide--just couldn't take the isolation and, and the, the regimen that, that we had to go through.  It was--most of the time when you're at sea, I mean, you're just bored.  I mean, you don't have anything.  It's just water, you go to bed, water, wake up, water.  I mean, it took us two weeks to get over there, and a lot of people couldn't deal with that.  And so, there were a lot of issues mentally that we had to watch out for, physical things we had to watch out for, so it was dangerous.
Story_ID: 260416
Speaker 1: And how long were you in the [U.S.] Navy?
Speaker 2: Two years active duty, and then I had to do three or four years [U.S. Navy] Reserve when I got out.  I only end up doing two.  They didn't want me--I didn't want them (laughter).  So, you know, I was always in trouble when I was on the ship [USS Shenandoah] doing active duty.  I even did fifteen days in the brig once for being AWOL.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I would just leave.  I--oh, I don't, I can't, I'll just leave.  We were docked in Norfolk [Virginia] of course.  And if you don't come back in time, you'll on report.  So, one weekend, I just didn't come back, and I had to do fifteen days.  And it was no big deal, though, just, you know, get up, and want do exercises--march, that was it (laughter), no, no big deal.  But I was there for two years, and then when I got out, I did--I went to some meetings in, in the reserve, and then got my honorable discharge though (laughter).
Speaker 1: That was my next question.
Speaker 2: That's right--honorable discharge, right.
Speaker 1: So, you're a civilian again in what year?
Speaker 2: Nineteen sixty-eight [1968].  I got out earlier, two months early because my father [James Clingman, Sr.] had a heart attack, and they didn't expect him to live.  And they called me down there.  And you have to get up the [American] Red Cross to contact if you're in the service.  And they didn't want to let me go.  We were on our way back to the Mediterranean and, again, the--some of the people in the Navy at that time were just mean.  And this, this officer says, "Oh, you're not going home.  We'll gonna to take you to the Med--we'll fly you back home."  And the Red Cross, I called, I had my mother [Verline Green Clingman] call the Red Cross.  And she called them and they said, let him out now.  So, I got out in March.  I was supposed to get out in May to come home because my father was sick.  And they hated that.  They, they hated to let me out early because of my reputation and, you know, they know I didn't want to stay there anyway.  But I came home in, in--I got out in March, came home, and then had to go back, you know, 'cause I had an apartment there by that time.  And I had to get furniture and everything and come back home.  That's when I got out.
Speaker 1: Okay, in 1968?
Speaker 2: Right.
Story_ID: 260417
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned earlier that you remember exactly where you were when President [John Fitzgerald] Kennedy was shot and killed in Texas.  How about that--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: --day in April?
Speaker 2: --April 4th.
Speaker 1: Okay, when [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was assassinated?
Speaker 2: I know where I was.
Speaker 1: Yeah, where were you then?
Speaker 2: I was on my way from Norfolk [Virginia] down to Wilson, North Carolina, driving.  And I was, I stopped at this restaurant in Kinston, North Carolina.  It was a seafood restaurant, and I remember getting back into the car and hearing that.  That's where I first heard it on the radio.  And that's exactly where I was--1968.
Speaker 1: I know there were lots of riots in the--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in the urban North in the wake of his assassination.  What was the reaction in the community or various communities in the South that you recall?
Speaker 2: Well, I, I came home the weekend of the riot here in Cincinnati [Ohio].  And I remember seeing the National Guard troops on the streets and in the neighborhood where I used to live and everything.  I was just home for a weekend.  And in '68 [1968], you know, of course, we heard everything that happened and, and saw things going on in different cities.  It, it was, it was a bad time and we were all angry.  I remember my friends here in Cincinnati, you know, the anger that we expressed to, to one another, and how we wanted to just strike out and do something, and strike back, you know.  What we did, though, was start a little organization.  And I guess that was the beginning of my economic empowerment thing.  And we started a little organization just to, to kind of vent and, and blow off some steam by getting together.  But we put together a group and raised some money to try to help, help families and things with food and things.  That was one of, one of the things I did when I came home.
Story_ID: 260418
Speaker 1: What are some of the other things that you're starting to do now in the late '60s [1960s] to sort of maybe recapture that spirit of entrepreneurial (laughter), entrepreneurial activity--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --that possessed you as a child?
Speaker 2: Well, before I went into the [U.S.] Navy, I didn't tell you this.  I was working for the post office.  And that was, oh, I just loved to work there because of making $2.40 an hour, most I've ever made, but unfortunately, they had me working the night shift.  Can you imagine a nineteen-year-old having to go to work at twelve o'clock at night and get off at seven--can't go to the parties on the weekend, can't do anything?  And, but when I got out of the service, they had to hold my job for me.  Back then, they had to hold your job over a two-year period.  So, when I got out, I went right back to work, to work at the post office.  At night, they had the new machines and I had to learn all that.  And about six months into that, I said, there's no way I can do this the rest of my life 'cause some of the guys that I knew before I went into the Navy, I, I came back, they were still there doing the same thing--putting boxes and bags and putting the bags on the trucks, and sending where they--every night, you come in, this big mountain of boxes.  I, I worked in parcels, and you had to reduce that down and mail it.  I said I can't, I'm not going to do this.  So, I went looking for a job.  I quit.  I went looking for another job and, you now, was able to get a job as a management trainee for a bank here in Cincinnati [Ohio].  And that was unheard of--a black person in Cincinnati being in management in, in banking.  And I got into the program and worked my way through, and that's where I worked in banking and credit.  I hadn't even gone back to college at that time, but that's what started my--I guess you call my business career at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what program or bank was that?
Speaker 2: It was just a management trainee program.  They were looking for--as I look back on it, I think, doing, you know, in 1968, companies were starting to, you know, look for black folks to, you know, to work in management positions, or to try to, you know, at least have one.  And as I look back on it, I was their one because they moved me around to various branches.  I remember that.  And I thought, you know, hey, I get to put on a suit and tie and go to work, and I've never done that before.  And I was sitting behind a desk and that kind of thing, you know.  And it--oh, you're going to this branch this, this month.  You're going to do two months here, then you're going to go--and I'm sitting in front of these big windows where people walk by and see me, you know.  I'm sitting at a desk and wasn't making any money but, you know.  And as, as I thought about it later on in life, I said, they were showcasing me (laughter), you know.  I was the one they had, but probably people thought that--oh, they have a lot of black people working at that bank because I saw one downtown.  Oh, I saw another one out, you know, so it was all me.  And but, you know, I was, I guess, it, it was--I was fortunate to, to get into that and to learn about business, and to be with some of the people that, that I met then. And, and I, I moved.  I didn't stay there.  I, I moved through there to Westinghouse Credit [Corporation], worked there for a little while, did floor planning and, and credit management.  And I really didn't like that.  I didn't like the, the banking and, and the credit work.  I really liked to work with people.
Story_ID: 260419
Speaker 1: This is strange, not strange, but it's different.  Do you remember I told you about my probation officer--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --who was the nephew of the minister where my parents [Verline Greene Clingman and James Clingman, Sr.] went to church.  He, at that time, in 1969, '70 [1970], he was the, the executive director of the social work organization, here in Cincinnati [Ohio], called the Citizens Committee on Youth.  And I called him one day and said, I got to get away from--I need a job, you know, what can you do.  He said, come on down.  He gave me my first job in, in public sector work as a counsellor, and that's how I started in public sector and worked there for twenty years probably, the same, the same, and he's still alive here in Cincinnati as well.  But I, I had an interesting, interesting journey through the world of work.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: And you probably don't have enough time to hear all of the jobs that I've had and all of the different things I've done (laughter).
Speaker 2: Oh, we have lots of tapes, so we'll see how long this takes.
Speaker 1: Right (laughter).
Speaker 2: But, well, who was that, that individual who played that special--
Speaker 1: Henry Christman--
Speaker 2: Henry Christman.
Speaker 1: --Henry Christman, yes, yes, he helped me a great deal and, you know, I have him to thank for discipline, for his discipline as my probation officer, and helping me to go to North Carolina, and then for giving me my first position that I really valued 'cause I got to work with people.  I was a counsellor helping young, young kids who dropped out of high school and everything 'cause I could share with them my experience then.  So it was, it was a good, a good time and, you know, I owe that to him.
Speaker 2: Okay.  Now, you said you, you worked in the public sector for about twenty years.
Speaker 1: Yes.  Now I started in '72 [1972] and worked continuously until about 1980.  Eighty-one [1981], [President] Ronald [Wilson] Reagan came in and he cut these programs and, fortunate--unfortunately, the program I was working for, that I was managing at that time, was cut.  And then, I got back into it.  I managed the Head Start program for about three years--the whole county program here.  And then I became a consultant in public sector work as well, worked with [Mayor] Harold Washington in Chicago [Illinois] in his employment and training division as well.
Story_ID: 260420
Speaker 1: Did you ever decide to go back to college in all those years?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And when did that happen?
Speaker 2: Went back to college when I was thirty years old around 1973 after I started working with Henry Christman at the Neighborhood Youth Corps--took some courses at the University of Cincinnati [Cincinnati, Ohio] at, at night.  They had evening college there, and I decided to go full time, went four straight years, sixteen straight quarters, worked full time, and graduated magna cum laude at the time in 1977, four years later.  I had, I had to start all over.  They wouldn't give me credit for the year I had at North Carolina College [at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina], but I worked and went to school, and graduated in four years.  And Barbara Jordan spoke at my graduation--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Barbara Jordan, I'll never forget that.
Speaker 1: All right.  So now, so working and studying, you'll no stranger to that?
Speaker 2: Oh, no.
Speaker 1: By the 1970s and so--
Speaker 2: --no, no, no.
Speaker 1: --four years.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I graduated in '77 [1977].
Speaker 1: Piece of cake.
Speaker 2: You're right, yeah, yeah, did what I had to do.  I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't easy.  I, I took courses in the summer.  I went to school all summer.  I took these accel-, accelerated courses.  In the mornings, I would get up and go from 7:30 to 9:30, and then go to work, and then go to class after, you know, whatever I had to do.  I didn't want to be there ten years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some people, when they go to evening college, it takes ten years to get out.  But I was determined just take as many as I could, take a full load every, every quarter, and graduated in four years.
Speaker 1: All right.  And that was the University of Cincinnati?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: And your degree is in what field?
Speaker 2: Administrative management--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and personnel administration.  And I graduated, like I said, with honors and, and they gave me a full scholarship, academic scholarship to, to go to grad school in the school of economics.  I went one year and I just couldn't take it anymore.  I stopped.  I never did finish even though it would have been completely free.  I just stopped (laughter).
Speaker 1: Oh, any reason for that, that you wanted--?
Speaker 2: Just tired, and really didn't like the, the area of study that they wanted me to take.  They wanted me to take--they had a degree called the M.A.I.R.  Was it management--it had something to do with union work and industrial relations.  That, that's what the "IR" was for--industrial relations, master's of arts in industrial relations, and had to take a lot of labor law.  And we had to, to stay in the law library.  And I just--that wasn't me, I didn't like that.  They were paying for it, so they said this is where we want you to be so I, I didn't like it.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I stopped (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right.  So, with that bachelor's degree in hand, though, does that get you a promotion at work or a different kind of employment?
Speaker 2: Not really.  I was--I have, I think, virtually, everything I took, I'm not using, I didn't really use when I graduated.  I mean, some of the things that I learned in college, obviously, helped me in my work.  But you know how people go through college, and they become a this or a that.  I didn't, I didn't do that.  I had certain skills in business that I, that I knew about and accounting and, and administration, and things like that.  But I was working in the public sector.  I was a counsellor.  I worked for the board of education, vocational counsellor for high school kids, and I just, I liked to do that and, and that's where I stayed for a long time.
Story_ID: 260421
Speaker 1: So, when did you--you make the leap then from the counselling position to this focus on economics?
Speaker 2: Well, I worked as a counsellor, and then I moved to a contract administrator, learned a lot about it doing that.  I used to write training program, contracts for different schools that had, had, that offered training.  I worked for the CEDA [Community and Economic Development Association] program back then.  And then, I moved to an organization where I managed, actually managed a program.  I was program director and kind of graduated through different stages of, of management in the public sector.  And when I was Head Start director, I managed a $5 million budget back then in 1982.  And that kind of got me, made me even more aware of, of business and, and how it's, how you have to, to be accountable.  I worked there for about three years and, and became aware of spending $5 million in this community with businesses.  And one day, I called one of my assistants and said how much money are we spending on food?  And she gave me a figure and I said where are we spending it?  And she gave me this one company that we were spending all this money on food for--the Head Start centers.  And I said, are they doing anything for our families?  Are they giving anything back?  She said no.  I said what do you mean?  I said, they're not doing anything?  She said no.  I said, well, we need to contact them and get some reciprocity for this.  There's no rule that says that they have to get this money.  There are other options.  We have other people we can use.  If they're not going to help our families by giving them something, I don't know what, what it could be, they could help these children in some way.  Then we don't have to do business with them.  And from that point on, I became like a--known as the militant person, you know.  Even in board meetings, it was--Jim [HistoryMaker James Eugene Clingman, Jr.], you're too militant.  I said, why should we just give--if you, if you're in charge of millions of dollars in the public sector, that's leverage.  So, after I, I made that, we sent a letter to this food company.  And they started giving the families turkeys at Thanksgiving, helping the kids with other things.  That's the way it's supposed to be--not just to give somebody all your money, and you get nothing back, whether you're in the public sector or private sector.  And that was kind of the beginning of my foray into this whole economic empowerment thing.  And, and from there, it was dealing with this program that I was also over at the time called HEAP [Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP)].  It was--had to do with energy, or they would pay your gas and electric bill, and it was two hundred dollars a month.  And we had people back then who had electric bills, gas bills of twelve hundred dollars and, and I said, what is two hundred dollars going to do for these?  So I said, all we are right now--I was talking to our board and our agency--I said, we're just pass-throughs for money, for two hundred dollars.  What is that?  We need to design something that can help people in the long run, not just a Band-Aid kind of thing.  And then, our, you know, again, "Ohh, why do you think like that?  "Why do you," you know?  I said, we, we can't, we're not doing the proper service to our clients by just being pass-throughs.  And that kind of pushed me even further into more things that I could do or more things I, I thought I could do to empower people and, and not just to, to settle, you know.  And I haven't looked back from, from that point (laughter).
Speaker 1: So, you think it was that militancy that, or the streak of militancy (laughter) that ultimately--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --forced you to start your own businesses--
Speaker 2: Yeah--
Speaker 1: --or encouraged you to do that?
Speaker 2: --yeah, partially.  The company that I worked for, before I started my own business, moved and downsized.  And it was a small company to start with.  And so, I had to get out there and do something.  I knew, after all this time I've out here working, I can do something to sell it to somebody.  I know a lot of things.  I know the public sector like the back of my hand, so I could do some consulting or something.  And that's how, that's why I started it [Greater Cincinnati African American Chamber of Commerce], but the whole empowerment issue that I, I got into--it's just out, out of the need and the recognition of the fact that, especially among black people in this country, that, you know, we have to own something.  You can't just rely on, on the largess of, of corporations and public sector programs.  We have to own something.  We have to be entrepreneurs and that, I just worked on that and worked on it and, and it grew from my knowledge of, of and awareness of history.  I did a lot of reading and, and at that time, and my knowledge and awareness of history just said, hey, this is the logical step.  We can't just sit here and not use whatever resources we have, intellectual and financial to empower ourselves.

Speaker 1: So, with that skill set that you had in leaving the public sector employment, were you very successful when you struck out on your own?
Speaker 2: Well, before I struck out on my own, I worked for a marketing firm in Chicago [Illinois].  I left Cincinnati [Ohio].  The, the president of the company called me and said, I want you to work, come up here and work full time.  And I said, I don't know anything about marketing.  I have never worked in marketing.  She said, I want you because of your public sector experience.  I want you to start a public sector division of, of a marketing firm.  And she said you have good people skills and I want you to do that.  So, I had done some part-time work for, for her for a company.  And I went up there, quit the agency here, went to Chicago--oh, completely mind-blowing experience, a cultural shock, you know, with all the changes and everything.  But I went there and did start a public sector division for the company.  And our first big contract was with the employment and training division of the City of Cin- City of Chicago when Harold Washington was mayor--very successful.  So, I increased that business of that company by more than $650,000, and it was a small company.  But we had that much in contracts from the city, and from a private sector entity in Chicago called Chicago United [Chicago, Illinois].  And we were in charge of the summer youth employment program where we would get the kids, help the kids to, to find employment and everything.  We doubled their previous year's placement by doing a public-private partnership between Chicago United, the major companies in Chicago, and the Mayor's Employment and Training Division [sic. Mayor's Office of Employment and Training].  And it was very successful.  I still have pictures and, and, you know, videotapes of promotions that we did.  So, from there, when the company downsized and moved, decided to move, that's when I said, well, I, I've got to do something on my own 'cause I didn't know anybody in Chicago enough to--I did look for employment, talked to people that I, that I knew, the few people that I knew, but wasn't able to find anything.  So, I started doing consulting work, doing market research programs, did focus groups, did promotions.  I worked for The National Bowling Association as a market, as the market director, as a consultant for about fiv- no, about six years.  And, you know, just pieced together an income based upon what I, what I learned in marketing.
Speaker 1: So was that a period of sacrifice and starvation, or are you doing (laughter) okay as a consultant?
Speaker 2: No, I was doing, I was doing okay--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah, I was eating, I wasn't missing any meals.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  It wasn't steady.  I mean, you know, you had to go out and earn your keep, but I never had a problem where I said, oh, I don't know how I'm gonna, you know, do this or do that, so it worked out okay.  It wasn't the best of times but, hey, life is full of peaks and valleys (laughter).
Story_ID: 260423
Speaker 1: Now, you've already introduced the subject of blacks and economics and ownership.  All right.  When are you able to take all of those various elements and combine them into this--you get this principle of Blackonomics that I've heard you mention.
Speaker 2: Well, I moved back to Cincinnati [Ohio] in 1990 and I had to get back into the swing of things.  And I knew people here--comfort, you know, comfortable here, got back involved and did some volunteering.  I got on some committees and everything.  And this one group called Operation BootStrap--it was put together by Cincinnati's health director at that time, Stanley Broadnax.  And I would go to meetings, and then they started breaking up into smaller committees and economic development committee.  I said, that's where I want to be.  And I wrote a position paper on why we should have an African American chamber of commerce here.  In 1991, I wrote that paper, gave it to him.  "Oh, this is great, Jim [HistoryMaker James Eugene Clingman, Jr.]."  No-, nothing ever happened with it though.  Eventually, Operation BootStrap went out of, of existence.  And I started working for another program where I was working with ex-offenders, young men who had been in prison, helping them get, get jobs.  And the chamber of commerce thing was like put on the back burner.  But at that time, I was still doing a lot of volunteer work in, in the community, became active in different issues and things in, in Cincinnati, and worked for the agency with the young men.  And then, I went back as a consultant to work in the employment and training division with Henry Christman again.  He hired me to write some proposals to, to get grants, to start new programs.  And with the Ford Foundation [New York, New York] and other, and other foundations, so I did that as a consultant.  And along came the Million Man March in 1995, which I attended.  And a year later, I founded the [Greater Cincinnati] African American Chamber of Commerce after presenting the idea to a group of people at a meeting, and they said yes, and we started that night.
Story_ID: 260424
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], at the end of our last segment, you mentioned that you attended the Million Man March on Washington [D.C.]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and then came home to Cincinnati [Ohio] and, and launched the [Greater Cincinnati] African American Chamber of Commerce.  Was there something that happened in [Washington] D.C. as part of that march that really inspired you to do that?  Was there a connection?
Speaker 2: Yes, there was certainly a connection.  Of course, my commitment was there before I went, my commitment to do something in economic empowerment.  And, like I said, I wrote the original paper for the chamber in '91 [1991].  But it just wasn't hitting--I guess it just wasn't, it wasn't taking legs back then with people in Cincinnati.  But after I went to the march, of course, we stood there all day long, participated, and heard all the speeches and everything.  And, and when I came back, I was, I was enthusiastic even more than I was before I left and saying, hey, we gotta do something, you know.  We can't just go and stand all day, and talk and feel good, and come home, and do nothing.  I'm about doing good, rather than just feeling good, or in addition to feeling good, 'cause it was a good feeling to be there.  So, I talked to different people after I got back home and said, we gotta do this chamber.  We have to have a chamber.  We don't have--we're 43 percent of the population that don't have a business organization that advocates for black businesses.  So, the more I talked about it, the more it, you know, people--the word got around.  And I was finally able to, to get this guy who had these meetings with entrepreneurs on a monthly basis, to agree to let me come and address them.  And I gave them a little spiel.  And that night, and my--before I sat down, I said, how many of you in here would be willing to pay, say, a hundred dollars a year to have your own chamber of commerce?  All the hands flew up and everything.  And little did I know that they would bring their money up to the table that night.  And about forty-two people came up, gave cash, gave checks, and they said, we'll start it tonight.  That's how it got started, June 14th, 1996, about nine months after the Million Man March.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yep.
Speaker 1: Is the organization still active?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, it's still active.  During the time that I was there, I worked as a volunteer, the executive director, the president for about eighteen months.  And then, I was finally able to get a salary.  And I left my job with the Career Resource Center in public sector to go and work for the chamber full time.  And doing that, during my tenure, we were, we moved to about five hundred members, and went from a budget of about twenty-five thousand dollars a year to over a million.  And I left in May of 2000.  And it's still--we, I managed to get a building for the chamber.  We have our own building and it's still here in Cincinnati.  You may see it before you leave, but it's there, and still up and running.  I'm not involved with it anymore but, you know, I know what role I had in it, and that's good enough for me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, where is that building located?
Speaker 2: It's on Gilbert Avenue.  Matter of fact, it's right across the street from the Harriet Beecher Stowe House [Cincinnati, Ohio] in a very historic part of Cincinnati where a lot of black entrepreneurs used to be.  And I was happy to get a building right there where people--you won't know these names probably--Horace Sudduth, who owned a hotel right down the street from the African American chamber building.  A guy named Wendell [P.] Dabney, who had a newspaper [The Ohio Enterprise], he lived right down the street on, around the corner from the building.  And it was all kind of, all kinds of entrepreneurs there in the, in the '30s [1930s], '40s [1940s], and '50s [1950s] in that one section of Cincinnati called Walnut Hills.
Story_ID: 260425
Speaker 1: Now, again, getting back to the, the idea of the Million Man March and the inspiration associated with that--why did you feel that was something you needed to participate in?
Speaker 2: Well, if there were 999,999 men there (laughter) and I made that million, I wanted to be--make that million.  It, it was just something I, I just always said if, if they're going to be there, I, I have to be there.  If this is going to happen, I have to be there.  And, like I said, I missed the March on Washington, but--
Speaker 1: In '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: In '63 [1963].  But I was determined to, to go to this, not for reasons that people would think most men went.  I think, initially, people thought, aww, they're just going because Mr. Farra-, [HistoryMaker Minister Louis] Farrakhan called.  And people are gonna go because somebody's going to be there.  That wasn't my reason for going.  My reason for going was to, to be with a million black men, standing up for principle and, and, and creating what I envisioned to be closer relationships, relationships that would evolve to strategies that would--not only bring us closer together, but maybe stop some of the violence that was going on among and between black men, and give us more pride.  And, you know, the whole ball of wax is why I went.  I didn't go because of any personality--who would be there.  I went just to, to soak in the, the relationships.  I met people and, you know, it was just the hugging-- I never hugged anybody before I went to the Million Man March.  I wasn't a hugger.  It was a stand-off thing.  But when I came back--now, you know, it's, it's a natural thing with men.  So, all of that was, you know, went into my reasons for going.  I just, I just knew I had to be there.  Something inside that you--there's no way, I mean that, I never said I'm not going to go.  I just had, I had to go.
Speaker 1: Do you think that was true for a lot of the men who you had a chance to meet with there, that it wasn't really about Farrakhan and the call for a day--
Speaker 2: Right, right--
Speaker 1: --day of atonement?
Speaker 2: --right, right.
Speaker 1: Is this the coming together of the, the men of the community?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  There were surveys done, of course, among, among the people who were there.  I know one, I know two, two men who did that, and we may get to that in the interview.  But a lot of people came because they wanted to express, as an individual, be a part of a collective expression of unity, of standing together, and making a statement.  I wrote my first little book on the Million Man March which I'll share with you.  But they said they came because they wanted to make a statement.  Others said that they came because they wanted to look for ways to deal with economic empowerment, to create ways to empower us as a people, and to set the examples as men to lead the way to do that, to be examples for our children.  So, all of those things were reasons for people coming.
Story_ID: 260426
Speaker 1: I'm glad that we were able to introduce this topic because this is the tenth anniversary year for the [Million Man] March--
Speaker 2: Right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --and, of course, [HistoryMaker] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan calling for another march now--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --in the fall of 2005.  Do you think you might be a part of that?
Speaker 2: It depends.  When I got back, I did a television interview here in Cincinnati [Ohio] on one of the programs.  And they were asking me about the Million Man March.  And the host asked me, well, suppose they have it again.  Do you think it should be an annual thing?  You know, what I said?  I have it on tape today.  I said, we can't do this again.  That's what I said.  I said, this will never happen again.  We may do another march, but we're not going to do this again.  This is once in a lifetime thing.  That's just how strongly I felt about it then because one thing that took place there was the passing of the money.  I wrote an article in February of 1995 in the, in, in black newspapers that said, I hope that when we go to Washington [D.C.], we will raise some money, collectively, and do something, start a collective fund or something.  Something has to come out of this march that has an economic basis.  And when they called for the donations, you should have seen all of that money just--it was like a wave.  It was just being passed from hand to hand--just here, pass it down.  They had these big boxes--collect.  That was one of the best feelings for me because I'm thinking, we have to do, we can't have all these people here, and not do anything with some money, you know.  Unfortunately, it didn't lead to anything nationally.  That's a big issue that I have with what took place at the march, and what did not take place at the march.  I know the expenses had to be paid.  You, we couldn't go there free.  We had to pay for that--all the sound equipment--everything had to be paid for.  But from that point, the fact that we mixed our--we pooled our money.  Millions of dollars [sic. $245,000] was raised, right then and there in an instant.  The fact that we did that should have had some impetus for us to come home, and to create local funds, which Jim [HistoryMaker James Eugene Clingman, Jr.] stuck his neck out and did it again in Cincinnati.  But I was very disappointed because there was no sustained effort to continue that.  Anything you do in this country, you're going to have an economic base.  And I was very impressed with that, and I was proud to put my little donation in, too.  But that was a disappointment.  So, I said we can't do that again on that, on that program.  I said, you can't do this again.  This was so, this was bigger than life.  This was something that you'll never see it again.  They may do another march, but it won't be this one.  So, now you ask if I'm planning on going back.  I have some thoughts about that.  And I'm thinking, if it's in Washington, I don't think I'm going.  I hope, and I plan on writing something about this, maybe a letter to Mr. Farrakhan, or somebody to suggest that it be in Detroit [Michigan].  If we would have a Million Man March in Detroit, I'm there.  Why Detroit?  Eighty-seven percent black.  Why Detroit?  No business, no economic enclave control managed by black people.  Of course, the history of Detroit, its, its central location is, is also good.  But the fact that--I don't know if you've been keeping up with the news.  But a few months ago, there was plan put forth to, to city council and to the Mayor [Kwame Kilpatrick] to develop a black business enclave in Detroit.  And I just think that, symbolically, going to Washington, to me, going back ten years later, would, would suggest, symbolically, that we're going back to Washington to ask the government, to ask the establishment for something.  Now people say, well, we go back to apologize and atone and all that.  That's not why I went, and that's not why I would go this time.  Symbolically, going to Detroit, to me, would be saying to us, as a people, that we're asking ourselves for something, something that we have, but we haven't been willing to give.  So I don't even know if, if anybody's talked to him about Detroit or not.  But I plan to write something about it because I think that's where we should be.  If I had to choose, I would pick Detroit.  So, like I said, if it's Washington, I, I probably won't go, not because I have anything, it's a negative thing or anything.  I just probably won't go because, like I said, we can't do the Million Man March again, can't do that one again, but if it's in Detroit, I'll be there.
Story_ID: 260427
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], I guess there, there is certainly a lot to be said for what individuals can do when they're acting collectively--
Speaker 2: Collectively.
Speaker 1: --for, for something like a Million Man March--
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: --and even if one dollar is passed--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: --from every hand.  It's a million dollar venture--
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right, that's right, that's right, yeah, that's right
Speaker 1: --before the day is over.  But I wanted to ask also about this, this idea of leadership, you know, of an individual who can act as a power broker.  And I know you said you were in Chicago [Illinois] for a time, and you had the opportunity to work in that city during the tenure of Mayor Harold Washington.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And so, can you just help me to understand that someone who's lived all of her life in Ohio, what it was about that man (laughter)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --that made him such a leader at the national level--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --not just for the blacks who were concentrated on the South Side of Chicago?
Speaker 2: That's right, that's right.
Speaker 1: Yeah, what was that about?
Speaker 2: He had a personality, not--I, I can't, I'm not going to sit here and make you think I have, I was a personal friend of his.  I knew him.  I met him.  I worked, I did work with his staff.  But from what I can see, from my vantage point, his personality was such that, first of all, he was very strong, strong-minded.  And he knew what he had to do, and he was determined to do it.  But his personality was such that he, he reached out to all the people in, all of the people in Chicago, and did the things that led to empowerment among the marginalized, traditionally marginalized groups, namely, African Americans and others.  He made waves, especially among the counsel, you know, and the aldermen that, that they had there.  And I remember [James] Dvorak.  He used to be always at odds with Harold Washington.  And I think he's still there on, on the city council in Chicago.  But Harold made waves, and if you're going to change, especially the Chicago machine, you have to be willing to take some risks.  And you have to understand that, that, that there are a lot of people, there were a lot of people who didn't like what he did.  He knew that going in, saw it, but he heard the call of the people, and responded to it, and stood up like man and, and did what he was supposed to do as the leader of the City of Chicago, and opened up many doors to people that had been traditionally closed.  And I admired that about him.  I admired him for that.  And you're right, he, he brought that city together in a way that has not been done since, probably hadn't been done before, and I think that's what made him larger than life, and put him on the national scale and everything because Chicago's a tough town (laughter).  You know, Chicago's a tough town, but he made significant changes and opened up a lot of doors for a lot of people who would not have normally had those doors opened for them.
Story_ID: 260428
Speaker 1: As someone who was written about, and lectured about, and encouraged other people to think and act with their own economic interests in mind (laughter), do you think that government will have a major role to play, government policy especially, in invigorating businesses in the black community, or is it going to have come from the grassroots level?
Speaker 2: Well, I think both.  But the initiative has to come from those of us who are out here on, on the grassroot level, the activists.  We have to, we have--there are certain things we have to do, certain sacrifices we have to make to show people that we are serious about what we say we want and need.  Of course, the government can play a role in it, but I wouldn't want the government to, to be the sole provider of the things that we need.  I think Thomas Jefferson said it a long time ago that a government large enough to give you everything you need is also large enough to take away everything you have.  So, we must participate in the political system to shape public policy that's going to advantage us as black people.  And the politics is about self-interest.  Unfortunately, over the last forty years, although we've had some twelve thousand black people elected to public office, we're still economically at the bottom of every economic category in this country.  And there, there obviously was a disconnect somewhere in the last forty years.  And I say it took place around 1965 to 1970 or 1975.  So, while we do need the government to some degree, the government helped major corporations if you know your history.  Major corporations got subsidies from, from the government.  That's how they are what they are today.  So, I'm not saying that we shouldn't get--we pay taxes.  I'm not saying we shouldn't get assistance from the government.  But certainly, we should be serious enough about our own economic destiny that we're willing to make the sacrifices as Frederick Douglass, admonished us, you can't expect to have crops with no rain and thunder.  So, we have to make some sacrifices and take on some, some struggles sometimes to make people know, to let them know we're serious about this.  We're serious about our children's future and we're going to build an economic legacy, and leave it here for them.  And we're going to do our part.  We expect you to do your part, and if you don't, we're going to, to implement some kind of sanction against you.  The problem with black people in this country, collectively, number one, is that we don't stick together to a great degree, to demand certain things.  We know power concedes nothing without a demand as Frederick told us.  But the other issue is that we won't pool our, our resources, both intellectual and financial, to create a base, a foundation.  When I started the black chamber [Greater Cincinnati African American Chamber of Commerce], I insisted that, that the way we would start would be with our money.  And, traditionally, in Cincinnati [Ohio], when people want to start things, they got to run downtown to Procter & Gamble [Cincinnati, Ohio], got to ask Kroger's [The Kroger Company, Cincinnati, Ohio], got to go--I said, no, we're not asking anybody for any money.  If we don't put our money down to start this chamber with our dollars, we don't need it.  We don't deserve it.  We obviously don't want it.  So, the foundation was laid with black dollars.  And then, as we progressed, the corporations came in.  Oh, we'd like to help out.  That's fine, but the foundation was there with our money.  And I think that's true, and it should be true on a collective basis to move us forward in terms of economic empowerment, collectively, in this country.  But we have to show that we're serious about it.  How do you show you're serious?  You put yourself in the position to be able to reward your friends and punish your enemies.  How do you do that in this country?  With dollars, with dollars.
Story_ID: 260429
Speaker 1: I was in Tulsa, Oklahoma last--about three weeks ago, went to the Greenwood district, which you know is flourishing in the early 1900s.  Some six hundred black businesses had everything from, from restaurants to, all the way up to an airline.  Everything black folks needed, they had it right there in the Greenwood district.  In 1921, it was destroyed, burned to the ground, burned to the ground because of an angry white mob came in and, and, and destroyed it.  And three hundred people were killed.  You look at those kinds of things, and even though it was back then during segregation, it shows you what can be done among people who are collective in their struggle, among people who are committed to being economically empowered.  And we could do the same thing today if we would just use our resources in a collective manner in support of one another, as other groups are doing in this country every single day.  You look at the Vietnamese.  They've only been here for thirty years.  They control the nail industry now.  Koreans control the distribution of black hair care products.  The, the people who came from India and Pakistan, two-thirds of the hotels and motels in this country owned by them.  There is no way we should have dropped the economic ball in 1965, and just went and to play the political game alone.  We should have stayed on boat.  Nobody abandons their economic base.  We did, and now we're paying dearly for it, trying to get back to where we were to where our brothers and sisters were, to where our elders were in 1921 in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  So, you know, I have some real deep feelings about that and major concerns about where we are versus how long we've been in this country, been here since it started.  And, and there is a lot of work to do on the economic side, and that's why I'm so committed to it.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So, is that the message we're going to read when we visit your website--
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.
Speaker 2: --or columns in the newspapers--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --letters to the editors?
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 2: It's the same message?
Speaker 1: It's the same message.
Speaker 2: Economics--
Speaker 1: Economic empowerment--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --economic empowerment.  The only way we can fight in this country to make an impact is with our dollars.  All we say that the, the new battlefield is the marketplace and the weapons are dollars.  If we don't use that, use the $723 billion, collectively, that we earn, and it's rising that we don't use that in some way to leverage the things that we say we want and need and to build an economic foundation for our children, we're being, we're not being good stewards of what God has given us.  We're just being slothful as it says in the Bible.  We're just squandering our resources.  How can you have that much money, and tremendous amounts of intellectual capital, and not be further along, and not be higher on the economic scale in this country than we are today?  And even further back, relatively speaking, than our elders were back during the days of Tulsa and Durham, North Carolina, which was a flourishing business enclave for black people and many other cities around, around the country as well.

Speaker 1: Now, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], I know you said you, you lecture, in addition to the writing.  You teach--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --at the university level?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you find that your students, the members of the audiences where you lecture, that they are receptive to the message that you deliver and are they acting on the information?
Speaker 2: Now, you just asked the right question (laughter).  They're very receptive.  I speak all over the country and I tell people right off.  I didn't come just to make you feel good.  I came to say something to make you do good.  And it's, it's, it's a message that is very well-received because I didn't make it up.  It didn't just start with me.  Our ancestors put forth this message years and years and years ago, and they showed us what to do.  My latest book called 'Black-O-Knowledge[: Stuff We Need to Know,' James Clingman] reconnects us to the knowledge that our ancestors passed down to us.  They're saying, look, we showed you guys what to do.  Why don't you just do it?  And so, I'm not--I don't have any proprietary claim over this economic empowerment message.  I'm just one in a long time of, of griots really that continue to pass it down.  So, the message is well-received, but now the acting part, the doing, you know, (laughter), that's where we have, where I have issues.  It's not enough doing.  We know what we must do in this country.  You can't tell me that as, as intelligent as we are, that we don't know what needs to be done.  It's just the doing that seems to get in the way.  And until we change that, we're going to find ourselves going, I think, further and further down on the scale as other groups continue to build up their economic base, surpassing us in a lot of ways.  We, you know, it's just, to me, it, it's, it's an embarrassing, insulting, unconscionable legacy that we will leave to our children if we don't do more around economic empowerment.

Speaker 1: Yes, yes.  And the business, and all of the wonderful work that you do here in Cincinnati [Ohio] and across the country.  But I wonder, does it leave you any time for family, if you have family?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  I was just talking about that about a week ago.  And I was in New York [New York] in Brooklyn [New York, New York] doing some workshops on stewardship in a church there, Flatlands Church of Christ [New York, New York], and was talking about it with my minister who went--we went together.  And I was saying, you know, I have to learn how to say no a lot more than I, than I have been.  Every time somebody calls, when you speak here, can you do this, can you do that?  And I would be, I will do it, I will do it.  I have a real good relationship with my daughter and my wife.  My wife supports me in what I do.  She understands it.  Sometimes I'll be gone and, you know, doing things out of town, everything.  My daughter, as she's growing up now, is a little more--what can I say--resistance to my leaving, but we have an excellent relationship.  They're supportive--both of them are very supportive of what I do, but I have to make a change.  I have to say, I can't do this, you know, I have to start saying no a lot more than I, than I used to because that relationship is real important.  And, you know, we all know that time is, is fleeting, and I have to pay more attention to that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And just for the record, would you say their names, your wife's name and your daughter's name?
Speaker 2: My wife's name is Sylvia [Barfield Clingman] and her maiden name is Barfield.  She's from Chicago [Illinois].  And my daughter's name is Kiah, K-I-A-H, Kiah Clingman.

Speaker 1: Now, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], this has been a wonderful discussion, a lot of history--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --here on these tapes.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: But you mentioned the idea of legacy.  And, and now, you've mentioned Kiah [Clingman], I'd like to ask, what do you hope that your legacy will be to her, and to other African American children?
Speaker 2: Well, I consider that I am living my legacy before her very eyes.  I'm, obviously, much older than the normal father of an eleven-year-old.  And I started very early, even before she was born, writing things to her and about her.  And I put it into a book and gave it to her when she turned--I think, five years old.  And then, I wrote a book called 'Fathers and Daughters' [James Clingman] which was some poetry, some musing, some thoughts about relationships, father-daughter relationship, some pictures of herself and myself, and that was a published book.  And, and she and I, you know, have shared a lot of good times.  I've taken her all over the country.  She's been everywhere, even out of the country a couple of times.  So, I'm living my legacy before her.  I try to live in a way that will provide example, the example to her of someone who is, who is honest, someone who cares about other people, someone who's responsible who would do what needs to be done to take care, and to contribute to the, to the care of our family.  My wife [Sylvia Barfield Clingman] works.  I can't take all the credit.  She's a nurse, a registered nurse, pediatric nurse, and, but I try to live my legacy.  When I'm no longer here, my, my daughter will have, obviously, all the things I've written, both for her and other things that I've written.  She'll have videotapes to watch.  She'll have all kinds of memories and things that we did together.  And she will have the [Greater Cincinnati] African American Chamber of Commerce, and she can drive by and say, my father started that.  She'll have an entrepreneurship high school [The Entrepreneur High School] here in Cincinnati [Ohio] that she can see that I started in 2001 which is still going.  And that's the legacy, and she'll obviously have the memories at, at church that I have done sermons at church.  I'm not a minister, but I've done sermons.  And she'll have a lot of things that she can look back on, remember, read, videotapes, and things like that, that she can look back on, and see who her father was.
Story_ID: 260433
Speaker 1: All right, [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], at the end of the last segment, you were beginning to tell us about this idea of legacy and, and the things that you would like to--well, you're living your legacy--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --you said before your daughter's [Kiah Clingman] eyes, your eleven-year-old daughter.  But I want to ask also, as part of this segment, is there anything in Cincinnati [Ohio] among your many accomplishments, but anything of which you're most proud--one thing?
Speaker 2: One thing would be the entrepreneurship high school [The Entrepreneur High School, Cincinnati, Ohio].  I think that's the culmination of--to, to a great degree, of the work that I've been doing to instill in our children, and our young people, the notion that they can own a business.  They can run a business.  They can start a business.  Even though they may choose to go to, to work for a corporation, they will still know that if they, if that corporation says it's time to give us our job back, they will have the skills to, to start a business.  And that high school was started after a year of haranguing the, on my part, of haranguing the board of education president and the Cincinnati Public School[s] superintendent.  I was able to finally get an opportunity to put together an organizing team, got some, some funds from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation [Seattle, Washington] in 2001 to start down this road of designing a high school for entrepreneurs in Cincinnati.  And I would think that, among all the things that I've been involved with, that would be my proudest (laughter) moment to have accomplished that, and to be there the first day when the students came in, not knowing what to expect.  Some couldn't even spell entrepreneurship, but to see that in less than a year, a couple of the ninth graders started their own businesses, and competed in business planning contests, and won on a national level, and a local level.  The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship [New York, New York] last year awarded our--two, two of our students, the top award for their business plan.  Our teacher got the teacher of the year, entrepreneurship teacher of the year from that foundation as well.  So, we're in our third year right now.  And next year, I'll be even prouder when I watch the first graduates come out of that school after four years.  So, it, it's an amazing accomplishment, not on my behalf so much, I was the, of course, the visionary, and insisted that we must have it, but there were other people who participated in the organizing team.  I had parents.  I had teachers.  I had students.  I had administrators, all on this team to design this school, and we actually designed it ourselves.  That was one of the criteria that the Gates Foundation laid out in its Small Schools Project.  And it, it's, it's been just a wonderful thing to watch the school progress, and to watch the students who came in, in the ninth grade, and who next year will be seniors to see them progress through this, and to stick it out because we kinda, you know, we had to make up things as we went along.  It's a small school, one hundred students per grade.  And they'll be moving into their own new building next school year.  And it, it's, it's just been a wonderful experience.  I still work with the school.  I don't work at the school, but I, I'm on the, what they call the Local School Decision Making Committee.  I chair that, so I still have contact with the school and the teachers and the staff and, and the students especially.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Mr. [James Eugene] Clingman [Jr.], this has been a wonderful discussion.  I, I thank you for sharing your history--
Speaker 2: (Laughter).
Speaker 1: --with The HistoryMakers, but I've come to the end of my list of questions.  And I'd just like to ask before we conclude this portion of the session.  Is there anything else that you would like to address that I haven't asked about?
Speaker 2: Well (laughter), I, I guess I, I could end this by just saying something about my transition.  I can call it from the world to, to God.  I could not have done all of the things that I have done, and still am doing, without the faith and, and the strength that I get from, from God.  I didn't--I went to church a lot, but the church--I was in the church, but it wasn't in me (laughter).  I didn't really commit to being in the church until 1998.  And from that point, I haven't looked back.  I mean, my feet hit the ground running.  And I've been doing all kinds of things and, and teaching classes, doing sermons, and things like that.  I, I figure I, I have to run faster than everybody else 'cause there was lots to, to try to make up for.  But without that, I wouldn't be doing, I'm sure, the things that I'm doing.  I wouldn't have the same attitude about what I'm doing because what I've done has taken some sacrifice, personal sacrifices.  I've took some risks.  I've, I've made some waves, said, and done some things that make people kind of uncomfortable, but I stand on the truth.  I stand up for what's right.  I stand against injustice, especially to people who are, who are needy.  And, and I've seen some things happen in, in Cincinnati [Ohio], of course, that I've spoken out against and stood up against.  And it kind of makes people uncomfortable, but in my writing, I do the same thing.  But I do that based on the strength that I have that has been given to me from God and the blessings I've been, I've been given from God 'cause there were times when I was doing some things.  I didn't know where I was going to get another contract.  I know people in Cincinnati, for the most part-"Uhh, don't bother with Jim, you know, he's, he's too radical, he's too this."  So, I just started going out of town to, to make my living.  But I'm still here--never missed a meal.  We pay our, our mortgage and, and I'm blessed for that.  And I, I really count that as a blessing.  I'm not looking for more.  I'm not just running after money and trying to get this and get that.  I'm not affluent.  I make it from month to month like a lot of people do, but I count it as a blessing.  I'm physically able to do the things that I do.  I still ride my bike.  I still compete in cycling and you have to be thankful for those things.  I've learned to be thankful for the things that many people take for granted and I used to take for granted.  So, I have to say that, that all that I've done and all that I continue to do, I couldn't do it without the strength that's given to me from God.
Speaker 1: Now, you mentioned that your family was active in the Baptist church when you were a child?
Speaker 2: Yes, early on.
Speaker 1: Are you still Baptist?
Speaker 2: No, no, we go to the Gray Road Church of Christ [Cincinnati, Ohio].  My father [James Clingman, Sr.] always went to the Church of Christ.  My mother [Verline Greene Clingman] was going to a Baptist Church.  Early on, when I was young, my, my mother  decided to, to come, and to attend the Church of Christ.  This was back in the late '50s [1950s] when she came.  And she, she stayed there until even my great-grandmother changed [Minerva Dow].  She was eighty years old and went back and got re-baptized at eighty years old.  And so, we've been in Church of Christ since then and, of course, my father's family, all of his history comes out of Church of Christ.
Speaker 1: Well, thank you so much for sharing with us again today.  And, at this point, I'd like to take a look at some of those photographs.
Speaker 2: I don't know if that's--if I can say that.  Richard Rose [Sr.] is our minister and he's been with our church now for twenty-five years.  And I'm proud to know him, and he's played a significant role as well in my growth in that area.

Speaker 1: This is a picture of, obviously, me and Gladys Knight.  I'm sure you, you recognize her.  That was part of a celebrity bowling tournament, believe it or not, that we had in San Jose, California in 1993.  I used to be the marketing director for The National Bowling Association, which is a black organization that was started in 1939.  At every year, we would have a, a major tournament and a celebrity bowling tournament.  Of course, she's not dressed, nor am I, for bowling at that particular time, but that, that was the banquet that we, that we had the night before the celebrity bowling tournament.  And Gladys Knight is an excellent bowler.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Here, you cropped it.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm sorry.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me at one of my proudest moments in Chicago [Illinois], meeting and, and talking with [Mayor] Harold Washington at a breakfast that we did for the summer youth employment program, a program that we designed, called Hire the Future.  And, of course, we were very privileged to meet and to work with Harold Washington during the time he was mayor of Chicago.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right, all right.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me and my daughter, Kiah [Clingman].  We were on a date that night.  We went to the Urban League gala.  My wife had to work at night and I decided to take Kiah out on a date.  She was about five years old then.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  Are you ready?
Speaker 2: Once again, a picture of Kiah and, and myself, and my wife, Sylvia [Barfield Clingman].  We were at some function during that time.  It was about 1999 or so.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, okay, ready.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my mother and father, James [Clingman, Sr.] and Verline [Greene] Clingman.  That picture was taken probably around 1946 or so.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Ready now.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my father and, and me.  I'm the little one (laughter).  That was taken probably in around 1951 or so.  We were in North Carolina at my, at my father's sister's house.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And straight about that.
Speaker 2: And then, when my daughter was about three--two or three years old, I decided to take her to that very same spot where my father and I stood, and to take a picture of, of her and, and me.  And that's the picture, and I cherish that picture as well because my father and I stood in the same spot.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of my father and me again.  This picture was probably taken in around, at around 1948, 1947 or so.
Speaker 1: All right.  And Easter Sunday yet or is that Easter (laughter)?
Speaker 2: Yes (laughter).  Believe it or not, we were at the zoo on this picture.  A friend of my father's, I remember his first name was Frank [ph.].  He's holding me and my father is standing there.  And my brother is standing on the bench--my brother, Charles [Clingman].
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: All right.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: This is a picture of me, of course, when we lived in, in the West End of Cincinnati [Ohio].  I was probably about eight years old and very proud to have my first suit (laughter).  I think it was on Mother's Day.  I had the flower on--yeah, that was Mother's day.
Speaker 1: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 2: On the left, there's my older brother, Charles.  And the little girl is my sister, Mabel [Greene Turner]--they call her Candy.  And the other little guy is me.  It was on my fourth birthday for a birthday party we had.

Speaker 2: That's a picture of our family.  Of course, my great-grandmother, Minnie Dow [Minerva Dow], is on the left.  My younger brother, Curtis [Clingman], was not born yet, so that's why you only see four children.  My mother and father, of course, the sibling that my mother is holding is Anthony [Clingman].  And, of course, my sister, to, to his right.  And I'm in the back.  And the reason I look the way I'm looking 'cause I was mad because they put me in the back of the sofa to stand by myself (laughter).  And I wasn't at the front, so I was mad (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of my great-great-grandmother.  Her name is Laura Anderson [ph.] and she lived in, in West Virginia, born in 1854.

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: All right.  That's me, about age twenty-two, in the [U.S.] Navy, of course, on ship.  I was over in Malta, the beautiful island of Malta in 1966.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.  And--
Speaker 1: I got that one.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Let's get this.
Speaker 1: You took that one the last time.

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right, okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture, obviously, with the Afro, in the, in the 1970s.  I think this picture was taken around 1978.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right.  For any special occasion?
Speaker 1: No, just one of those photography sessions where you go and get your picture taken every now and then-
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: --and this was, this happened to one that I took that year.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me doing what I love to do and that's riding.  This was taken on a ride, a two thousand-mile ride from Florida up to Virginia.  And, of course, I was out front on that particular occasion, leading the paceline.  I used to love to ride out there.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, ready.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of some of the brothers at the Gray Road Church of Christ [Cincinnati, Ohio].  I'm in there somewhere.  But one day, we had a meeting, a men's meeting and a men's program, men's day program.  And we took this picture of all of those who were there.  I think I'm right there in the middle.  Yes, I see it.  There I am, right above the man in the black.  That's our minister [Richard Rose, Sr.] right up in the middle, too, right up over the lectern.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  All right, all right, okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me at [John W.] Paisley High School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina when I was a junior.  The "Cool Papa" came from my emceeing the talent show and they gave me this, this nickname, "Cool Papa Clingman" (laughter), 1963--1962, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of a singing group that I started when I was in, in high school at Paisley called the Diablos, went on to be named the Untouchables [ph.], I think.  But, but the person in the middle, Clarence [Tex] Walker, went on to continue to singing with the, to, continue to sing with The Coasters and The Drifters.  And we were in our heyday then.  That was taken, again, in 1962.

And the one next to Clarence is William Scott [ph.] and he lives in Winston-Salem now.  And the one on the far end is Frank Thomas [ph.].  He was our bass singer.  He still lives in Winston-Salem as well--not that old, though.  I think he took that--yeah, in '99 [1999].
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay, good.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of me, obviously, on the cover of African American magazine.  I did an article in, in, in a newspaper.  And a man who publishes this magazine saw it in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  He came down to interview me here in Cincinnati after having read that article.  And he said, I'm going to put you on the cover of my magazine.  And little did I know, he was true to his word (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay (unclear), okay, ready.
Speaker 1: Oh, this is a picture of--now, I can't think of his name.  But he was the top, he won the top honors in, in grades, and I was second.  And we got to marshal, we were marshals for our graduating class.  That's why we have on red robes instead of black robes (laughter).  That's why he got to carry the flag (laughter).
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  He seems very happy to me (unclear).
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: This is a picture of four members of the five members of the organizing group that worked on putting the legal structure together for the [Greater Cincinnati] African American Chamber of Commerce in 1996.  That's me on the left and Loretta Allen sitting down, Steven Reece standing there, and Wenona Johnson who was our accountant, our CPA [Certified Public Accountant], at that time.

Speaker 2: (OFF-CAMERA VOICE):  Okay.
Speaker 1: Oh, we all know who that lady is on, on the right there, [HistoryMaker] Susan Taylor, my wife, Sylvia, and myself.  We took that in 1995 at a Black Expo that I was a part of managing here in Cincinnati.

And we had two friends, we made two new friends there, and they stood with us when we got, when we got married.  I'm trying to think of--is it Dothan [ph.] and can't think of the lady's name.
