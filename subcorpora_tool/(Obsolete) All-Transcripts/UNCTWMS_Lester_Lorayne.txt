Joey Fink: This is Joey Fink. I&#8217;m with the Southern Oral History Program. It&#8217;s May 11, 2011 and I&#8217;m in Knoxville, Tennessee at Club LeConte with Lorayne Lester. So, Dr. Lester, you started telling me a little bit about the early years of your career. Can we start just by you telling me when you were born and where you&#8217;re from?
Lorayne Lester: I was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on November 4, 1935, which means that I will be seventy-six years old come November, and I&#8217;m feeling every day of it, I might add. I started telling you about my experience at the university. Initially I was hired as an instructor in the English department. At that point I had very recently finished a master&#8217;s degree in English. Actually the English department housed also the speech communication faculty and the theater faculty as well, so my master&#8217;s thesis was on speech communication actually, rhetorical works. But as I have mentioned to Joey earlier ending up as an instructor in the English department was sort of the official landing place for the wives of faculty members so I became an instructor.   One can only remain an instructor at the university for seven years without applying for candidacy in a PhD program or in fact simply being terminated, so at that point I began working on a degree in the college of education and thought of myself as headed toward a career teaching high school and community college speech and theater faculty members how to manage their classrooms and in fact not damage high school and community college students as they prepared for a life in the public arena, for example. I finished the doctoral degree in 1975 but in fact through a kind of oddity I had already been hired permanently as an instructor in the&#8212;at that time&#8212;college of liberal arts, simply because the [university general counsel] decided that since I had been at the university more than seven years on a continuing appointment that in fact I had already earned tenure&#8212;  JF: Wow. [Laughs]  LL: &#8212;which I always found an odd circumstance but I wasn&#8217;t about to argue with anybody at that point. [Laughs] So upon completion of the degree I just automatically became an assistant professor in the department of speech and theater.   At around that time the university, in an attempt to beef up its theater program, had hired someone they thought of as a real rising star in the theater world. He also turned out to have an absolutely, phenomenally&#8212;how can I say it?&#8212;enhanced view of his own career. He was a very difficult man to work with but I think he landed on me as an associate or an assistant head because one, he hated administrative work but also I&#8217;ve always been convinced he was trying to recruit my husband into the theater program. I think my husband was probably one of the best actors around Knoxville at the time, so in order to demonstrate his own desire to connect with the community I think he really wanted to bring my husband on board. That didn&#8217;t happen, I might add.   But at any rate as this person, Dr. Ralph Allen, became more and more enmeshed in the theater program I ended up pretty much running the rest of the department, the academic program. At some point he decided that he didn&#8217;t really want any administrative responsibility any longer and at that point I guess I was appointed department head of speech and theater by the then dean of the college of liberal arts, Alvin Nielsen. As it turned out, Dr. Allen didn&#8217;t want to have any responsibility for what was happening but he still wanted to run the whole theater program and the result was a really strenuous divide between the people who had been on campus before he and his colleagues arrived and of course Dr. Allen and his colleagues. They made the whole affair so very unpleasant for me that I resigned as department head. I might add my husband was very disappointed in me. He wanted me to stick it out but it just got to be more than&#8212;. There were no tradeoffs in it for me.   After a year or two the faculty of the speech communication part of that department decided to petition a brand new dean coming into the college to separate the departments into a department of speech communication and a department of theater. At that time I guess there must have been some kind of quasi-official search but I became head of the department of speech communication and a new colleague, Dr. Thomas Cooke from the University of South Carolina, was hired to chair the department of theater. I&#8217;m trying to remember, I think that was probably about 1985, &#8217;86, somewhere along in that vicinity. But at any rate I became a department head again at that point and invariably these things just sort of seem to happen without much planning or forethought on my part. I seem to fall into these kinds of administrative tasks, and I will admit I&#8217;m good at that kind of detail work. I never was much of a scholar but I was always a very good researcher and generally pretty much knew where I was.   At any rate I served as department head of speech communication until 1990 and at that point was asked by Dean Larry Ratner, dean of the college of liberal arts, to apply for a vacancy that was to occur eminently in his office to become in effect an associate dean of the college of liberal arts. I accepted the job and in effect moved to the dean&#8217;s office in 1990 and almost immediately had to go back to Dr. Ratner and tell him that I thought I really couldn&#8217;t accept the job or stay there, my husband having been diagnosed just shortly into the new year with degenerative bone disease and bone cancer, so I didn&#8217;t feel that I could really pull my weight in the college because he did require a great deal of care. But Dean Ratner simply said just forget it; families come first up here and we will see that the work gets done, so do what you have to do.   At that point, starting in 1990, the university began to go through a series of budget reductions. I&#8217;m talking about reductions in the base money we got from the systems administration to run the college with. The college of arts and sciences at that point comprised, I want to say twenty-four to twenty-six departments and ten or eleven interdisciplinary programs. The college supplied all of the general education courses for all of the undergraduates throughout the university so we had an enormous responsibility and yet began to see a systematic reduction in state funds over succeeding years. The first task I had when I moved to the college office was to try to figure out how to get an increasing number of first time freshmen taught with a decreasing amount of money. So we sort of went through that year after year, the legislature having determined it would not increase the sales tax, and Tennessee has no income tax of course.   In about 1995 the current dean at that time, Dean Larry Ratner, decided to retire and the university started a national search for a new dean. In the middle of that search we had another budget reduction and the university in effect froze all searches and said there would be no national searches anywhere in the university, so again I just sort of fell into the job. There were three associate deans, I was the only woman, and was chosen by the provost, Dr. John Peters, who is now president of the University of Southern Illinois, to become interim dean. I learned shortly after my appointment that the department heads in the college&#8212;I guess there were twenty-six of them&#8212;had petitioned Dr. Peters to appoint me as dean without the interim, just appointed as dean. I was really very much surprised by this but I also knew that my colleagues, regardless of my degree path, really appreciated the work I had done in trying to help them through these successive budget reductions. I was an associate dean and had, I don&#8217;t know, something probably in excess of several million dollars to shepherd and distribute to various departments over the period of a semester.   At any rate I did become dean in 1996 until I retired in 2002, and I will have to admit that I really eventually decided to retire because I simply could not think of any more ways to cut the budget without substantially injuring the academic programs of the college of arts and sciences. We had changed our name by that time from liberal arts to arts and sciences. Of course shortly after I decided to retire the state legislature then did pass an increase in the sales tax so we got some new money coming into the college, but I was absolutely worn out. I don&#8217;t think anybody in a stressful academic administrative position really understands what a toll that kind of anxiety and pressure and working fourteen-, fifteen-hour days really does to you physically until you get out of the job, and then you realized you were falling apart all along, I&#8217;m afraid. So that&#8217;s where my professional career ended. I&#8217;m trying to remember how old I was when I decided to retire, but I know I was past sixty-five so I thought I deserved to retire at that point.   Okay, now it&#8217;s your turn. [Laughs] What else do you want to know?  JF: [Laughs] You&#8217;ve seen UT go through so many changes.  LL: I have.  JF: I think maybe if we just start at the beginning and I&#8217;ll ask you for your perspective on some things and if you have no opinion that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll start with what brought you to Tennessee. Did you choose to&#8212;?  LL: All three of my degrees are at the University of Tennessee. This is a result of coming to the university as an undergraduate and marrying a faculty member, so you&#8217;re kind of stuck at that point. I grew up in Chattanooga, Tennessee and actually decided to come to the university because my three best friends from high school were also coming here, but that&#8217;s how I ended up in Knoxville.   I think coming to the university and staying at the university for almost fifty years as student, faculty member, and then administrative personnel, really gives me an extraordinary view of what happened to the university during the course of that long period of time. When I was an undergraduate and even I think up through the time when I was an instructor the university was segregated. We had no black students and very, very few women at all in any kind of administrative position at the university. I mentioned earlier that my colleague, Faye Julian, and I kind of grew up together at the university. [Break in recording]  JF: Well we left off and I had asked you for your perspective on some of the changes that happened at the university and you started to talk about when the university was desegregating.  LL: Right. The president of the university at that time was Dr. Jack Reese, who is deceased now. He presided over, first of all, the desegregation of the university, and he pretty much said this will happen without incident on this campus, we don&#8217;t have to have any federal marshals coming in to escort students to class, and in point of fact he was right. I don&#8217;t think after he made a strong stand that anybody, regardless of personal views, would have dared to make a public protest. Shortly after that of course Title IX came into effect and Dr. Reese was responsible for bringing the university&#8217;s athletic programs into the mix and he in effect was the person who hired Pat Summitt as our women&#8217;s basketball coach when she was newly graduated from the University of Tennessee at Martin, and I think she was only twenty-two years old.   He pretty much said we are going to start hiring more women faculty, but more importantly he was president of the university at the time of the Geier Consent Decree, which doesn&#8217;t mean anything to you, but the Geier judicial decree, which the university had to accept, was based on the premise that the university was not doing enough to ensure the diversity, literally talking about African Americans. That decree was in effect, as nearly as I can remember, for about thirty years. While I was a department head and a dean I was trying to hire faculty with the understanding that I had to go to extraordinary length to find some African American candidates, and there was no question about bringing in somebody who was weak because all searches had to go from department head to dean to provost and then through a commission in the president&#8217;s office. They weren&#8217;t going to let you hire anybody who was not going to make it and really scrutinized every search throughout the campus with great detail. I remember this particularly vividly because I was trying to hire a debate coach, and if there was a predominance of African American debate coaches anywhere in the United States it had escaped my knowledge, but our search was turned down. That one in fact I did have to hedge on. I had to go find somebody, a strong scholar in another area, to pad the search so that we could hire the person, anybody, who could coach debate for us. That&#8217;s a very narrow discipline and it is very hard on any faculty member. They didn&#8217;t have time to earn tenure; they were taking these debate teams all over the country weekend after weekend. But in effect diversifying the university, for about thirty years, meant hiring African Americans. That&#8217;s just all there was to it.   At the time I first moved to the dean&#8217;s office the other brand new associate dean was an African American, a guy from the chemistry department, and he and I became great friends because we could commiserate, he dealing as an African American and my dealing as a woman, and we&#8217;re still very good friends in fact. We thought of ourselves as each other&#8217;s support staff for a long while because there just weren&#8217;t many of either of these classes of faculty members.   Okay, then with Title IX, that happened. The largest event, or the most important event, to my mind, apropos hiring women faculty, was the hiring of Dean Larry Ratner, and I&#8217;m thinking he came into the university probably about 1984 or &#8217;85. I think when he decided to retire in &#8217;94 or &#8217;95 it was because he&#8217;d been ten years on the job. He had been at the University of Wisconsin and I don&#8217;t think it ever occurred to him coming into the South and to the University of Tennessee that hiring women was not a priority. He just assumed that was the way you went, and in fact it got him into trouble on occasion, but he took the university&#8217;s guidelines about diversity absolutely at full face value. Most of the time he had great success in bringing in women faculty members and paying them in accordance with national scales, which got him into serious trouble because often we would bring in a woman assistant professor in a given discipline and we would bring her in at a salary probably commensurate with full professors who had been here forever and ever; a lot of problems.   I do recall one instance when he really got in a lot of trouble. The search was in the English department, which like half a dozen others considered itself the best in the college, but they had one female tenured faculty member.  JF: And this would have been in the mid &#8217;80s, if he came in &#8217;84 or &#8217;85.   LL: Yeah.  JF: Wow.  LL: I&#8217;m pretty sure I was already at the dean&#8217;s office so it would have been 1990 or a little bit after that.  JF: That&#8217;s amazing that they didn&#8217;t&#8212;. Wow.  LL: It just boggles the mind. [Laughs] Maybe that&#8217;s why I was so oblivious to women support groups around campus. I was so busy looking after my own hide, I suppose. But at any rate, the English department was authorized to do a national search for a new department head, and English and physics always decided they were the best creations that God ever put in the middle of a campus, neither of which was accurate, I might add. But at any rate the English department came up with five finalists, I think. Only one was a woman and she was head of the English department at I&#8217;m thinking Old Dominion or Richmond or one of those universities right there around the Richmond area. Two of the other candidates in the final pool were men who were already on the faculty. If they had anybody else on the outside I can&#8217;t remember. I was not involved with searches when I was an associate dean. At any rate, Larry decided that the way he read the university&#8217;s guidelines he was pretty much obligated to hire the woman. If he&#8217;d been given say five candidates, all of whom the English department search committee had verified were capable of doing the job, then his choice was absolutely clear. He had to go with the woman. So he hired a woman named Dorothy Scura&#8212;that&#8217;s S-c-u-r-a&#8212;and Dorothy and I became very good friends.   Dorothy had her own faults, I will admit to that, but she was just plopped down in the middle of a senior faculty&#8212;. As I said it was a very large department and only one woman on the tenured faculty. The English department&#8217;s position was&#8212;later I learned this&#8212;that Larry should have known that they really preferred one of their own men faculty members to be the department head. I remember in years afterwards trying to defend what he had done and they were just, no, he should have known that they wanted one of their own. Well they made Dorothy Scura&#8217;s life miserable, a concerted effort to drive her out of the job. I mean it was vicious. A letter writing campaign to the dean&#8217;s office talking about, I don&#8217;t remember the specifics even, but the dean had a file. I read through it one afternoon. Maybe twenty to thirty letters just describing this woman as nothing short of a she-devil, and this was a little kind of mousy woman who was an absolutely brilliant scholar and had been a fine department head in Virginia, but they just were not going to have it. That&#8217;s all there was to it.   So Larry in effect had to ask Dorothy to step down, and she did. She was just really battered by the whole process. But Larry thought he sort of got vindication in a way. Larry had a habit of hiring external department heads and he would bring them in at absolutely the top level of the salary he thought he could get from the provost&#8217;s office. Dorothy, of course, came in as the highest paid faculty member in the English department and the department faculty had all decided well Larry will reduce her salary appropriately, and he didn&#8217;t. Until she retired she was always the highest paid faculty member in the college, so that really galled them. In addition to that when Larry had to hire the second candidate, who was a member of the faculty, he brought that guy in at only a temporary ten percent increase in his base salary and just refused to budge. So when I left the college there was still this enormous discrepancy between this one woman on the faculty, full professor, tenured, one of the best researchers in the whole college, and the rest of the male faculty in the English department. I guess they got over it after awhile but I didn&#8217;t suggest to any of them that I intended to change that situation at all. It did get him into trouble.  Okay, so we got to trying to bring in more women in initial hires, and I&#8217;ll repeat that it was the dean&#8217;s insistence when I was in the college office and later when I became dean that we bring in the best women faculty we could find and we bring them in at nationally competitive salaries. The result is that now the university in effect has a coterie of associate professors, women at the associate professor level, who are paid as well as their peers nationally. But it still leaves a lot of male faculty members in the lurch and in some instances it was unfair and it&#8217;s still unfair because the university&#8217;s been able to do very little apropos somehow repairing&#8212;I think that&#8217;s the term the former dean used&#8212;repairing the salary budget of the college.   I don&#8217;t know what else I should mention. The university increased enrollment. I can&#8217;t remember what it was when I first&#8212;. Well when I first entered the university probably the freshman class was maybe six hundred students. When I left the freshman class, incoming first time freshmen, was at forty-six hundred students.   JF: Wow.  LL: I&#8217;m not sure how they&#8217;re managing to get that&#8212;. Well, I do know that the university is in very serious trouble right now trying to cover general education, simply because the enrollment has to stay up and the funding continues to disintegrate, especially after TARP funds were withdrawn. So the size of the university has increased dramatically over a period of say forty years. It often described itself as something of a cow college initially, which is one of the reasons my father wondered why I wanted to come here, because the University of Chattanooga at that time was considered just an absolutely nonpareil liberal arts college but it also cost about the same amount that coming to UT did.   So the university in the course of that period also developed a very strong relationship with Oak Ridge, especially with the national lab. It&#8217;s [K25X10]&#8212;. I don&#8217;t know what the current designation is, but at any rate that was a mandate of a former governor of the state who wanted to be sure that the University of Tennessee took advantage of all of the research that was going on at Oak Ridge and consequently created distinguished professorships which are funded directly from the governor&#8217;s office, but they are joint professorships. Those folks are paid half from ORNL&#8217;s budget and half from the University of Tennessee&#8217;s budget. The premise of course is that they&#8217;re coming to the campus and teaching, and that almost never happens, but rather they do see to the wellbeing and appropriate education of most of our graduate students in chemistry, physics, geography&#8212;I&#8217;m trying to think of&#8212;biochemistry, and evolutionary and environmental biology. All of the big science departments in the college now have some liaison with Oak Ridge National Lab, including, as I mentioned, a comparatively soft science, which is geography. They also do a good bit of work at Oak Ridge.   So the university has certainly expanded its science oriented mission, it has welcomed African American students and women students, and it&#8217;s painfully very much aware that its funding is going nowhere. I have to put it that way. That&#8217;s probably the best I can do. [Laughs]  JF: Can I take you back to the &#8217;50s? I was just curious, when you came to Knoxville to go to college&#8212;I guess this would have been in &#8217;53 or &#8217;54?  LL: &#8217;53, yeah.  JF: What were your expectations for what you would do with your degree, or what path your life would take?  LL: When I first entered the university I was in the college of business administration in the journalism program. I was interested in writing and thought that was going to be what I would do. Then of course I went home at Thanksgiving and I think that&#8217;s when my father said well I want you to have a teaching certification, so I did have to come back and change colleges and move over to the college of education. So I expected to do a lot of work in classroom management, communication with students, I don&#8217;t know, something along those lines, but what happened was an introduction to the college of liberal arts. The college of education at that time offered teaching instructional courses only at the junior and senior levels so I was pretty much a gen ed student for two years. I had had Latin in high school so I signed up for French; I thought that would be an adventure. We ended up having to take a single quarter&#8217;s work in physics, chemistry, and biology, and I&#8217;m not a science person, although I will have to admit I had to learn to look the part when I became dean. But I was just enamored of these kinds of things that I had never been exposed to in high school. I went to a very large, very good high school in Chattanooga but we didn&#8217;t have any courses in biochemistry or molecular biology or certainly not in any kind of&#8212;. Well I guess they did have geometry and probably one course in Calculus but I had avoided those in high school, so having to come into admittedly beginning level courses in so many different disciplines, it&#8217;s no wonder I think that I finally ended up in arts and sciences, because their stuff was a lot more interesting than what I was running into in the college of education. So I expected one thing and ended up being exposed to a lot of other things.  JF: So did you think you would get your degree and go on the job market and get a job?  LL: Yes. That&#8217;s what I thought. After the degree I was offered an assistantship in speech and theater, really to work in the theater backstage, and my mother and dad were not quite sure what that was going to amount to but it was a full ride assistantship so I thought well why not, but of course that&#8217;s when I met my husband and I never went home again, back to Chattanooga. It&#8217;s sort of the way it turned out, I guess.  JF: And how were you able to balance family and career?  LL: That was tough. Initially I guess it had probably occurred to me and to my husband that after our oldest child, our daughter, was born that I would probably become a stay-at-home mom, but I stayed home with my daughter I think for one quarter and I thought I was ready to blow my brains out. I think I had cleaned every closet and polished all the&#8212;. I just said I can&#8217;t do this, and of course finding daycare for children back in those days was really quite a problem but I didn&#8217;t think I had any other choice. I couldn&#8217;t be a stay-at-home mom; I just had to do something. So that&#8217;s when as I said the university kind of shoveled all these faculty wives into these various positions.   The most trying time, I think, came when I was working on the doctoral degree. We had two children by then and I was teaching freshman English I remember, three sections of freshman English and one section of English literature at the sophomore level, and trying to finish graduate course work and write the dissertation and take care of my kids and my husband all at the same time. I heard my daughter one time say, &#8220;When mom was working on her dissertation we didn&#8217;t see her for days on end,&#8221; and I said that was an exaggeration and she said, &#8220;Yeah, you took us to school, as I recall.&#8221; [Laughs] That was the most stressful time.   I don&#8217;t know what&#8212;. I think parenting involves something miraculous. Somehow your kids turn out to be marvelous, accomplished, gifted people and it&#8217;s not anything you do; they just sort of turn out that way. But my children still tease me a little bit about on given days sort of having to sit down with my husband: Now who&#8217;s going to get this kid to ballet and that kid to the boy scouts and who&#8217;s going to pick up&#8212;? And I will admit there was one occasion when we both forgot to pick up my son at his grade school and when I finally raced back to this little private school where both our kids went, there sat one of the custodians with my lone little boy, waiting for the parent to show up. [Laughs] But that only happened once. But that&#8217;s a real challenge and women in my generation didn&#8217;t think that there was any other way to do it. You just coped with doing all those things together.   But probably I guess the worst time was actually when my children, happily, were grown and out of the house, but trying to juggle the very demanding job in the dean&#8217;s office with my husband&#8217;s illness, which was lingering and really awful. I remember telling Dean Ratner, I said I will have to hire a practical nurse to stay with my husband all day, which means that she will be there from 9:00 to 5:00, I&#8217;ll be here at 9:30, and I have to leave at 4:30, and he said no problem; go for it. So happily we were at the beginning of the computer age and there were lots of things I could do at home, but that was a bad time and I&#8217;m sure that any woman who&#8217;s working full time who has to deal with trauma like that, it will take a toll that you may not realize at the time but it certainly is there. What else can I say?  JF: You said your husband was always very supportive of your career.  LL: Yeah.  JF: Do you think he was exceptional in his willingness to negotiate household responsibilities?   LL: I guess I didn&#8217;t&#8212;. I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t think so at the time. My own family&#8212;I grew up in Chattanooga&#8212;I guess my mother and father, they wanted you to be prepared but you could do anything you wanted to. I thought all families were like mine, they supported each other, were kind to each other, and I learned later I think that probably the majority of families in this country are dysfunctional to one degree or another. But it never occurred to me to question my husband&#8217;s support and I guess it was only after a number of years that I realized there were a lot of men in this world who didn&#8217;t want their wives involved professionally in anything. As I look back on it my brothers were in that number, I think, although eventually all of them had to give up and let their wives, or even encourage their wives to go back to work.   JF: Because their wives demanded it or because economically it made more sense?  LL: I&#8217;m really not sure, but they all married college graduates and women who eventually just went back to work. I never delved very much into that aspect of their lives. I think there were a lot of men who would not have been comfortable with working wives.   JF: You talked a little bit about being a woman in leadership over men, that a lot of men were uncomfortable with a woman in a position of leadership.  LL: Well I think that&#8217;s certainly the case. There were times when&#8212;. I do remember one time where a professor in the math department, a senior full professor, made an appointment with me, and my office was such that I was at one end of a kind of corridor with a lot of work stations lined up and actually my secretary was all the way at the other end. When somebody would come in to keep an appointment she would meet that person at the door, take him or her to a kind of waiting area outside my office, and then come in and tell me that so-and-so was here and I&#8217;d say, okay, tell them I&#8217;ll be right out. But there&#8217;s only one occasion where in fact I went out and said, &#8220;Dr. So-and-so, please come in, how can I help you?&#8221; and this guy took one look at me and said, &#8220;I made a mistake,&#8221; and turned and left the office. He apparently still thought Dean Ratner was the dean. That&#8217;s the only time that happened. Otherwise I guess I was aware that some people resented me but I just decided I&#8217;m not going there. That&#8217;s their problem; I&#8217;m not going to deal with that.   There were times when the way I was treated would bother me when I could in fact conclude from a certain series of behavior that I was being treated differently. I was always very much aware that if&#8212;. I really don&#8217;t know how to say this. To departmental secretaries who called to make appointments or called to speak with me, I was always &#8220;Lorayne,&#8221; but they referred to their bosses as &#8220;Dr. So-and-so&#8221; and &#8220;Dr. This.&#8221; This is really the pits, but just, you know, let the little stuff go. But when I became dean I made it my business to get to know every senior secretary in all the departments and I&#8217;d call them by their first name and they called me by my first name. But you learn really quickly that those are the sergeant majors out there and they know a lot more than the department heads, generally, which I resented deeply, that they were having to do work&#8212;. I remember one department head, I asked him to do something and he said, &#8220;My secretary doesn&#8217;t have time,&#8221; and that just flew all over me. I said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask your secretary, I asked you, but I will not ask again. You will do this.&#8221;   I got a lot of raised eyebrows, but I don&#8217;t know. It just never occurred to me that people could disagree when I was obviously right about something, I don&#8217;t know any other way to put it, and if they did that was their problem, not mine. I guess I probably came across as a very smartass woman but the workload was massive, there was never enough lead time to be thoughtful about a lot of decisions. I tried to have regular meetings with all the department heads, always there from dawn until midnight sometimes, so I will admit that I was more than once taken aback by a faculty member&#8217;s or a department head&#8217;s getting absolutely irate at hearing the truth about something. Honestly, I still don&#8217;t understand that. If somebody gets a ton of bad evaluations or somebody is turned down for tenure by the faculty in his department my attitude was: Suck it up. That&#8217;s the way the world is. Well, I&#8217;ll have to admit, they were always men, I think. But that surprised me then and I guess it still surprises me now, that there are people who just: I know what I believe; don&#8217;t tell me anything different. So that, I think, was hard coming from a woman [52:09 often].   JF: You mentioned this a little bit over lunch but I&#8217;ll ask: Why do you think you were able to assert yourself as a leader, even when you were getting indications that&#8212;?  LL: I think it just has to do with support. If you know your boss is&#8212;. John Peters told me on one occasion, he said he&#8217;d been around the United States as a provost, as a chancellor, as whatnot, and he said, &#8220;You&#8217;re the best dean I&#8217;ve ever worked with,&#8221; and I didn&#8217;t know what he meant but eventually came to realize that I guess I was always aggressive in getting the task done. Whatever had to be done no matter how unpleasant I just went ahead and did it. But mostly I think it was knowing that you had the support. I was always very good about communicating, to let my boss know what was happening and why I needed his help or didn&#8217;t need his help or needed another million dollars or something. But I think that basically was it, just knowing that somebody had your back.   JF: You mentioned that the provost, John Peters, and your husband and your mentor, Paul Soper, and having that unqualified male support.  LL: Yes. Well, maybe it&#8217;s not necessary now but certainly back then you just knew you couldn&#8217;t do it by yourself. I&#8217;m quite sure with respect to Dr. Soper, whom I just idolized, marvelous teacher, that part of it was I was doing about half of his job at the salary of an instructor. I do remember that when I first started teaching at the university we were on the quarter system, and as I said as an instructor you did three sections of freshman and all the kids wrote twenty-five essays a term.  JF: Oh my gosh.  LL: And teaching a class of from thirty-six to forty sophomores European lit. My salary was slightly in excess of three thousand dollars annually. [Laughs] Now that I think back about that it&#8217;s preposterous. [Laughs] But interestingly enough I remember when I&#8217;d been teaching as an instructor for three years and got a letter from the systems administrator that you&#8217;ve been at the university three years, you&#8217;re vested if you want to join the retirement system, this is your opportunity. My husband was out of town, he was in the reserves so he may have been gone to summer camp or something, but I didn&#8217;t know what to do. What do you mean &#8220;retirement?&#8221; I&#8217;m twenty-something years old. So I went to the associate head of the English department and he said, &#8220;Lorayne, take everything the university offers you because nothing will ever compensate you at this university for the amount of work you do.&#8221; Okay, I&#8217;ll do it.  JF: [Laughs]  LL: And in point of fact the state employees, who came in about the time I did, really had the opportunity of being a part of a retirement system that collapsed probably about ten years later so that people who were hired after that time really didn&#8217;t get quite as nice a deal. At one point apparently the state was embarrassed by the fact that they couldn&#8217;t offer faculty members a raise so the state began picking up the total cost of your retirement, whatever you were contributing to, and most universities still it&#8217;s half and half, but from that time on the state put the totality of every monthly payment into the retirement system for faculty members. They got over that after awhile. [Laughs]  JF: You also mentioned that you grew up with brothers.  LL: Oh yeah, and I think there is first the element that this was a very tight knit, strong family, but I also realized at a later date how competitive my family was. My brothers were all very much involved in athletics. Three of them went to college on athletic scholarships. But I realized that growing up, through high school, I thought you had to be good at athletics to compete with my brothers and I got to college and realized I don&#8217;t like that stuff at all. [Laughs] But a lot of built in competition, and probably we all became slightly aggressive people, I&#8217;m convinced of it, so I just thought that was the way of the world, sort of depending on your family but if you thought you were right you just went ahead and did what had to be done. I&#8217;m still very close to my brothers. One of my brothers is deceased, but I probably talk with them&#8212;one&#8217;s in Chattanooga, one&#8217;s in Huntsville, and one&#8217;s in Charlotte&#8212;probably once every two weeks at least. We still talk and try to get together at least once a year, and as I said I thought that&#8217;s the way all families were but learned that&#8217;s not the case, not certainly in my husband&#8217;s family. He denied it years later but when we were first married he said he couldn&#8217;t stand his father, and of course years afterwards he said, &#8220;I never said anything like that.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, you did.&#8221; [Laughs] But we were very close, very supportive. I think you grow up then expecting that the world is going to support you, and just don&#8217;t look back. [Laughs] Go forward. What else can I tell you?  JF: Well you mentioned that as an associate dean you organized, or there were monthly luncheons for women?  LL: That was when I was dean. Especially in the sciences, the life sciences and then in physical sciences, a lot of the men department heads had women associate heads, and I was pretty sure they were doing most of the work. I think there was one woman in all of those sciences, one woman department head, and I just became aware that she was putting up with a lot, so I just started having these luncheons and I talked about the need to do something with the human resources guy at the university at that time. He&#8217;s retired, I think, since, but he thought it was a good idea and suggested that I also invite a woman who was in the central administration to come and meet with us so that these women in my college would have my perspective as dean but then a central administration person as well. I think, even after I retired, that that went on for a bit, but what I wanted to do really was especially to let these associate heads, these women in the sciences, know how to deal with very demanding, domineering men, and a lot of them have done well, they really have.   JF: What were some of the strategies or some of the advice that seemed to work best?  LL: Well it was not so much advice as giving them information. That&#8217;s always been my premise, is it&#8217;s your job to know more than everybody else. If you&#8217;re going to nail somebody, if you have to, then you&#8217;ve got to know more than that person does. I never could know as much science as anybody in the sciences but I knew more about administrating a science program than many of these guys did so that was the basic strategy, to tell them how something actually worked. I got interested in that when I was associate head in speech and theater. We couldn&#8217;t figure out what this formula was that the university was supposedly funding under, what got you a new faculty position, how did you get enough specially equipped classrooms, and you really just ended up trying to figure out a lot of this stuff because your department head didn&#8217;t know. That was my first concern, just be sure these women have more information than whomever they&#8217;re dealing with who is in a position to wield power. They&#8217;ve got to know more than he knows.   So that&#8217;s how it started, just trying to tell them about how things work. A lot of the issues came down to dealing with junior faculty members, their needs, their research space, their research funding, how the university figured those formulas, what kinds of strategies worked in competitive venues like for research funding, travel money, writing grant applications, all those kinds of things, just try to see that they had more information or that they knew anything that very often department heads didn&#8217;t know. I guess that&#8217;s probably the sum of it. Then the administrative person from the central administration who met with us was a very good friend of mine, but she could tell them how decisions were made at that level: This is the way you write this kind of proposal to see to it that it&#8217;s going to be better than anybody else&#8217;s. So that&#8217;s it mostly, just information, but I&#8217;m proud of the fact that a number of those women have gone on to do really remarkable things as administrators. Two ended up at the National Science Foundation in Washington, so I felt good about it.   JF: That&#8217;s great. I wish somebody was doing something like that at my school.  LL: Well it&#8217;s not happening now. As a former dean you can offer only so many suggestions. I know there are women in my college and in other colleges around the campus who really could use some kind of support but I&#8217;m not in a position to go there anymore.   JF: As dean did you deal directly with female faculty members if they had issues or complaints in their department around sexual harassment or gender equity?  LL: I don&#8217;t think I&#8212;. If there was an instance of that I can&#8217;t remember it. I did have to deal on two occasions with male faculty members who had been accused, both of whom came very close to crying in my office, asking me to stop this investigation, this is not true, blah, blah, blah, but the university was really under a very serious mandate. If you accept federal money then this is how you&#8217;re going to deal with these kinds of gender or racial or whatever situations, and all I could do was say I&#8217;m not in a position to be your judge in this matter. I am in a position to tell you that you have created a situation that is intolerable for your colleagues. Both of these guys in effect were denied tenure, they were both in science departments, and there were things they did that I probably could have told them they shouldn&#8217;t do, but I didn&#8217;t feel I could really get involved. There is a member of the central administration whose business it is to look into these kinds of issues and I wasn&#8217;t going to go there but I was not going to cover anything up either, so it was sad.   One of the guys&#8212;I&#8217;ll tell you this now&#8212;one of the things he did, which I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t realize at all, but one of my areas of research was nonverbal communication for awhile, but this guy moved into your space, just to carry on an everyday conversation. This would have been uncomfortable for him. He would have had to pull his chair right over to the corner. I spoke with him at a number of public occasions, receptions or something, and in every instance I was aware that what I wanted to do was step back. He was too close.  JF: Did he do this to men and women?  LL: I don&#8217;t know. The men never complained; I&#8217;ll put it that way. The other guy was in one of the sciences and took groups of students every summer to do research in the Everglades. I don&#8217;t know what they were doing but they lived in these kind of, I don&#8217;t know what, quasi-dormitories that would house&#8212;. There would be a big meeting room and then sort of a sleeping gallery on either side. The facility was owned by the University of Georgia and we were just able to rent it sometimes. But he would walk around in his underpants. It was not air conditioned, they were there in the summertime in the middle of a swamp, and I guess I could understand that, but it really made the women uncomfortable, but I didn&#8217;t say it. I just said some things are happening at that camp which have got to stop, and he didn&#8217;t know what I was talking about and I said you&#8217;ll have to deal with committee; they&#8217;ve got the report. But what I had to do in order to satisfy the tenure committee was to see to it that he was not in any kind of situation for the year he had when he knew that he was not going to be tenured. No women graduate students were assigned to him and no small seminar groups. All he could do was teach big lecture sections.   They were uncomfortable situations. Both of them said they didn&#8217;t know what they were doing but in hindsight they had some inkling. Both of them happened to be married. I think one had no children, the other had one son. This is awful: They were both married to really unattractive women. They were women in the same discipline, and this was before the day when you hired somebody, the trailing spouse is coming through, you&#8217;ve got to find a tenured position for her too. But I thought if you&#8217;re both in the same discipline and you&#8217;re both alike politically, philosophically, what do you talk about at night and what are your lives like? I realize now I was just looking for ways of rationalizing their behavior, but you really couldn&#8217;t. They knew what they were doing. Both of them, I&#8217;ll have to admit, got jobs at good universities elsewhere, but nobody at those hiring universities ever called to ask me why the person was leaving either, so we just didn&#8217;t go there.  JF: It brought something up in my mind that maybe deep down inside they knew what they were doing but professed, probably very persuasively, that they didn&#8217;t mean to, they didn&#8217;t know what they were doing, versus when I talk to women, especially women who came into universities in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s when there weren&#8217;t a whole lot of women faculty, how conscious they were of their bodies, of how they looked, of the way they were looked at, and I just wonder it that rings true with you.  LL: Oh wow, yeah.  JF: I mean I can tell you personally even now, in 2011, if I have to lead a discussion section as a TA I spend time thinking about what I&#8217;m going to wear: Is it too short? Is it too low cut? Is my hair too wild? Is my makeup too much?  LL: Absolutely. I learned from a friend after my deanship that all the women administrators at the university were called &#8220;suits&#8221; because we all wore suits, period, and the men would come in in slacks and shirtsleeves but the women administrators did not. You reminded me also that last summer I had varicose veins repaired and when the physician first came in to look at the sonographs, or whatever they were looking at, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you were a teacher,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Yeah, this is forty years of standing on your feet in high heeled shoes,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a story I hear [1:12:19 every day.]&#8221;   Now, of course, I mean Suzanne doesn&#8217;t wear high heels to class, but you just did. In the classes you went into, you were put together. I don&#8217;t think I ever wore slacks to class until, I don&#8217;t know, probably the &#8217;80s, sometime in there. You wore dresses, you wore stockings and high heeled shoes, and what a fool we were to do those kinds of things. [Laughs]   JF: But I think there&#8217;s&#8212;. It&#8217;s a shame it has to be that way but&#8212;  LL: No, you know&#8212;  JF: &#8212;there is something to it.  LL: &#8212;I shouldn&#8217;t have said that because I really don&#8217;t believe that. Having a granddaughter, I&#8217;m mightily distressed now with women on television. You look at male newscasters, they&#8217;re all up there with suits and ties and looking all put together and you see women newscasters and they&#8217;re in all kinds of revealing clothes, skirts up to here, and I don&#8217;t get it. I don&#8217;t know what this means or how one is supposed to think of these women. There was a situation on the news not too long ago; I think it was in Boston, up east someplace. A woman was raped and somehow managed to survive. It was intended to be a homicide. One of the newscasters, like an idiot, asked the sheriff, how can women protect themselves from this kind of random violence, and he said stop dressing like sluts. And of course the national media, CNN, went bananas; here we go, blaming the victim again. He apologized and retracted his statement, but there was a kernel of truth there which he should have figured out a better way to talk about. There is an element of you&#8217;ve got to stop dressing provocatively if you&#8217;re going into a bar in a seedy side of town.   I&#8217;m very conscious of the fact that my granddaughter, she wants to be a princess. She idolizes these popular singers, these women who could just as well be standing up there stark naked as far as I&#8217;m concerned. So I have mixed feelings about it, and yes we did always look put together when we went to class, but I&#8217;m not entirely comfortable with women&#8217;s fashions right now. I&#8217;ll put it that way. Of course I&#8217;m sure my granddaughter will win when it comes to any argument. [Laughs] But I would have to admit that I guess I grew up in a pretty conservative household because I&#8217;m beginning to remember my father wouldn&#8217;t let me wear those short skirts that we used to wear to the roller rink and roller skating was a really big deal when I was growing up and I just thought that was terrible. I just wouldn&#8217;t go if I couldn&#8217;t dress like everybody else. Then of course you become aware of how much young people want to be just like everybody else. They don&#8217;t want to be different.   But I&#8217;m uneasy about modern fashion, I will say that, and I&#8217;m not blaming the victim; I&#8217;m just saying be smart. On the other hand, being smart means knowing how to take care of your self I think, and I won&#8217;t go any further. [Laughs]   JF: Another thing you mentioned, you said you thought that your height might have given you a little bit of extra confidence or advantage?  LL: I don&#8217;t know. I never thought about it except that two of my colleagues, women teachers, said that to me on occasion. One of them was a fellow graduate student in the English department. We were both teaching sections of freshman English, I guess, and she talked about having real difficulty with a really smart alecky student and I said you&#8217;ve got to stand this guy down. She said that&#8217;s easy enough for you to say; you&#8217;re taller than he is. Then another was a woman faculty member when I was department head in speech communication who came in and again tried to deal with a male student and she said I can&#8217;t go back into that classroom; that man frightens me. Well he frightened me too [Laughs] but I just said I&#8217;ll come to class with you for the next few times. This guy really was scary. He was a veteran and it was a public speaking class and one of the assignments that they had to do was&#8212;. The first speech they did was to be a demonstration speech, tell us how to do something, and this guy brought an AK-47 into the classroom and showed us how to dismantle and clean this weapon, and I didn&#8217;t blame her for being scared out of her mind. But he was in bad shape; he didn&#8217;t finish the term. But she said, you can do this; you stand up there on the side of the classroom and you&#8217;re taller than everybody in there. Okay. [Laughs]   So I don&#8217;t know, but there are certain nonverbal things that I realize that I did take advantage of. At department heads&#8217; meetings while everybody was seated I was up as if I was teaching a class, in my stockings and high heeled shoes. You learn a lot from teaching courses in nonverbal communication about things to do and things not to do. There was another guy in biochemistry and he told me that he was going to retire but he wanted to meet&#8212;. This was probably the beginning of the winter term, winter quarter, winter semester, whatever. He was going to retire but he wanted to meet with me regularly to tell me what was wrong with the department of biochemistry. So I met with him, probably once every two weeks for the rest of the year, and just listened to him spew out this poison about all the rest of the faculty. He also said if you tell anybody in that department that I&#8217;m retiring I&#8217;ll stay. I will change my mind; I won&#8217;t retire. Okay. So I listened to all this. Well interestingly enough he left and then the department head and a group of their senior faculty came to my office and chewed me out for not letting them know that this guy was leaving because it just made it appear that their department head didn&#8217;t know anything. Well I just let them run down and I finally said this is what the situation was: If I had told you he would not retire. Now, if you want me to get on the phone and call him to come back, be my guest. I was holding a pencil in my hand and I broke it in two [Laughs] and they all just kind of went like that. I was so angry but I did not lose my cool. I did get up at that point and they were all seated and I started kind of pacing around my office and the apologies just poured out of that bunch. But they actually blanched, I mean turned white, and I was just sitting there trying to control myself and the pencil broke in two. They probably never got over that either. [Laughs]   But those were some of the things that I guess I had known but they were things we learned in nonverbal communication. Get up and move and you have everybody&#8217;s attention. I&#8217;m telling you about bizarre things that happened. They didn&#8217;t happen all the time. [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] So the women&#8217;s movement of the &#8217;70s, did you feel at all connected to that&#8212;  LL: No.  JF: &#8212;or did that have any influence in your life?  LL: Well I guess it just sort of verified what I already knew, that women were at the bottom of the totem pole. I didn&#8217;t feel empowered as a result of that. [1:22:00 It kind of bypassed the South, I guess is&#8212;].   You&#8217;re reminding me of another occasion that had nothing to do with academe. I mentioned that my brothers&#8217; families and mine, we try to get together once a year. We were at some state park, all the families and the kids, and one of my brothers remarked&#8212;. One of the banks in Knoxville had failed. I mean the feds came up here from Atlanta in a fleet of black SUVs and just&#8212;. It was in this building, not the First Tennessee Bank at that time but a bank, which the government took over. But one of my brothers was arguing about the president of this bank was just vilified and made to look like a scoundrel, and I just blew up. I said he&#8217;s a crook. [Laughs] He stole all of this money. He kind of stepped back and he said, &#8220;I never thought I would hear my sister use that tone of voice,&#8221; and I said, &#8220;Charlie, you&#8217;re wrong.&#8221; [Laughs] But I guess that&#8217;s reminding me that my brothers were pretty conservative. We all grew up with a little bit of this, you know, woman&#8217;s place is in the home. But my mother was a very strong woman as well. She was not afraid of anything. But that really caught me right between the eyes: I never thought my sister would address me that way. But you&#8217;re wrong, [Laughs] and if you&#8217;re wrong you ought to acknowledge it.   That&#8217;s neither here nor there. Got any other questions? [Laughs]  JF: [Laughs] [Pause] Well just looking over some of the online research I did, looking over your career, you&#8217;re just a bit of a path breaker: The first woman who was appointed dean to the college of arts and sciences and one of the first five women to reach full professorship in the college.  LL: I never thought of myself that way but on two occasions where I was asked to come and talk about the university, two civic groups, one in Oak Ridge and one here in Knoxville, in both instances whomever it was that introduced me spoke of me as having broken the glass ceiling, and I never thought of myself that way at all. I was just irritated that women had to work so much harder than men did for the same thing, so.   I think they probably want us&#8212;. They&#8217;ve got an event up here at 4:00.  JF: Thank you so much, Dr. Lester. I really enjoyed talking with you.
