Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.  A very historic building.  Has always been in the hands of a physician since the turn of the century.  And the building was built in 1880.
Story_ID: 10892
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Juanita, J-U-A-N-I-T-A, Elizabeth, Jackson, Mitchell. Jackson, of course, is spelled with my name--middle name and Mitchell which I spelled with my last name.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Hot Springs, Arkansas. And I just--I should know that.  But I don't off the tip of my tongue.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Her birth date you mean?
Speaker 2: Yeah, her birth date.
Speaker 1: Approximate year?  You have that?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I think 1916. But I'm not certain on that.
Story_ID: 10893
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about her [mother, Juanita Elizabeth Mitchell Jackson] side of the family?  How much do you know about her ancestors and--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Quite a bit.
Speaker 1: --your ancestors?
Speaker 2: Quite a bit.  In terms of her side of the family, her mother Lillie Carroll, C-A-R-R-O-L-L Jackson was a relative of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, the signer of the Declaration of Independence.
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.  So this is--.
Speaker 2: And that lineage comes on her father's side.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And on her mother's side, Bowen, B-O-W-E-N was an African chief from East Africa, who went to England and married an Englishwoman and brought her here in the eighteenth century, so none of his children would be slaves.
Speaker 1: He brought his wife here.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: So that his children would not be slaves?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Well--.
Speaker 2: Because they were married in England.  And they weren't native Marylanders to be considered enslaved.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Right, but in England he made--the laws were such that he could have--his children could've been enslaved, had he stayed there or--?
Speaker 2: I'm not certain as to what the laws in England had as it regarded to slavery.  But as a free person coming from another country, they wouldn't automatically enslave you.
Speaker 1: I see. Okay.  All right.  So he settled in Baltimore [Maryland].  And he was--.
Speaker 2: Well he settled in Montgomery County [Maryland].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And his progeny contributed to my mother's mother's genealogy.
Speaker 1: Okay.  How do you spell his name?  Bowen?
Speaker 2: B-O-W-E-N.  In Africa it was spelled B-O-E-N, but later was changed to B-O-W-E-N in this country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  And so on that side you have a history of freed men of color, I guess? Or free people of color--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: From the eighteenth century.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Going forward.
Speaker 2: And on her father's side, her ancestor Daniel Carroll was born on the Darragon (ph.) plantation of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, sired by Charles Carroll of Carrollton.  And in recognition of this child, when he became of age, Charles Carroll Carrollton deeded land to him which was a significant measure at that time to own up to parenthood.  And Daniel Carroll then went on to buy more land and establish thriving land business.
Speaker 1: That is significant 'cause quite a few of the--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: --signers of the Declaration [of Independence] had offspring--black offspring that--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sure.
Speaker 1: They did not recognize.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sure, sure.
Speaker 1: That's right.  And so on both sides of your mother's family there are free people of color--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: With land and--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And position I guess on some level.
Story_ID: 10894
Speaker 1: Can you tell us about your father's side of the family.  Can you give us his full name and spell it for us.
Speaker 2: Clarence, C-L-A, C-L-A-R-E-N-C-E, Murice, M-U-R-I-C-E, Mitchell, M-I-T-C-H-E-L-L,  Junior.  And he was the product of Clarence Mitchell Senior and Elsie Mitchell.  And his lineage comes from Montgomery County, [Maryland] of free African Americans.  And her lineage comes from Enoch Pratt of the Enoch Pratt [Free] Library here in Baltimore, [Maryland].  A wealthy donor who contributed to establishing the library system in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: So this is a--this is a wealthy white Baltimorean--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sure.
Speaker 1: --on side as well.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now were her ancestors free too?  Freed by the Pratts or freed in some other way?
Speaker 2: Yes, they were.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But another generation.  Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  So,  all right.  What--Tell us about--Are there any stories about these ancestors that are passed down that would be interested to people, you know, looking at this biography?
Speaker 2: No.  Other than the documentation of lineage.  And that was very important in my grandmother's generation.  To really knew--to really know who your ancestors were.
Story_ID: 10895
Speaker 1: Tell us about your mother [Juanita Elizabeth Mitchell Jackson] first though.  What was she like and what did she--what did she do for a living?
Speaker 2: My mother was brilliant.  She was the first African American woman to practice law in Maryland, who finished University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania] at the age of sixteen.  And had her master's at eighteen.  And then went to law school at night, raising four sons. And graduating number two in her class.  Was prohibited from taking bar review courses due to racial segregation laws and organized her own bar review course.  And everyone passed.  She then joined the civil rights battle to eliminate apartheid in Maryland.  And through her efforts, integrated public schools before the [Brown v. Board of Education Topeka, Kansas] 1954 Supreme Court decision. Was instrumental in preparing the briefs to integrate University of Maryland [College Park, Maryland] systems that included the law school, medical school, the nursing school, the school of social work.
Speaker 1: Okay.  She was quite active and quite effective apparently.
Speaker 2: Sure.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now is there a story about how she and your father met?
Speaker 2: My father was on the debate team of Lincoln University in [Lincoln University] Pennsylvania.  And participated in a debate against Howard University [Washington, D.C.] here in Baltimore.  And they met at that time.  And organized Young Peoples' Forum to serve as a means of addressing the issues of the day that were related to apartheid in this country.  And thereby, with close interaction fell in love and married.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So the organization was Young Peoples' Forum.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.  Does that still exist in any form?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you know how long it lasted?
Speaker 2: It lasted for about five years.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Was it associated with NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] or anything--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) No.  My mother traveled all over the country shortly after finishing University of Pennsylvania, for the NAACP, organizing youth branches.
Speaker 1: Right.  Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And the NAACP Youth branches were very important in those days.  They were the--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 1: They generated a lot of the first sit-in activities and so forth.
Speaker 2: Well they didn't generate the sit-in activities at that time.  This was in the '30s [1930s]
Speaker 1: Mm-hm.
Speaker 2: But they generated protest movements against lynching in this country--,
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 2: --that was rampant.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well it wasn't until the late '50s [1950s] or early '60s [1960s] that the sit-ins started.  Right?  But the youth branches were involved in Wichita [Kansas] and other places.
Speaker 2: Well that didn't start with NAACP.  That started with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee [SNCC].
Speaker 1: Oh.
Speaker 2: And my brother Clarence Mitchell III was a part of that organization.  And met to develop strategy with [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] to begin that process.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There're a couple of story about how that started.  And one is that it started with the NAACP youth group in Wichita [Kansas] with Ron Walters's group.
Speaker 2: Well I think it was spontaneous throughout the country.  But I think that this is why from a historical perspective it's very important to document what different component groups of the Civil Rights Movement did so that revisionism doesn't take over in history and incorrectly identify the evolution of the Civil Rights Movement.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now in the '30s, did your mother have any stories about organizing the anti-lynching campaigns that--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh yes.  There were rampant lynchings in Maryland on the Eastern Shore. Shortly after college, my father [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr.] worked as a reporter for the 'Afro' ['Afro-American Newspaper', Baltimore, Maryland] and covered a lynching on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.  And so that changed him to commit his life to the struggle for equality in this country.
Speaker 1: Now does the Eastern Shore, that's the birthplace of Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.  Does it--Is it more rural than the rest of Maryland?
Speaker 2: Yes because of its isolated aspect.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Can only be reached by boat.
Story_ID: 10896
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about your father [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr.].  What was he like and what did he do?
Speaker 2: He grew up in poverty in a family during the [Great] Depression that knitted themselves together to survive economically.  Was able to achieve academically while working three jobs, frequently at night. Finished Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] as valedictorian of his class.  Wrote the class poem, gave the class speech.  And armed himself with academic excellence to make a difference as did my mother, to bring to bear on the problem of apartheid in Mary--in America.  The resources that were necessary to conquer it.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: And you said he was a reporter for the 'Afro-American [Newspaper]' [Baltimore, Maryland] or a while?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) Yes.
Speaker 2: And what other things did he do in terms of occupation?
Speaker 1: (Simultaneously) He then worked for the War Manpower Commission during World War II.  Prior to that, after my parents' marriage, he was director of the Urban League for St. Paul, Minnesota.  Then he came to Washington [D.C.] with the War Manpower Commission.  And then was named as Director of the Baltimore--of the Washington Bureau of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].
Story_ID: 10897
Speaker 1: I want you to tell us about growing up.  And you said off-camera that you grew up in this neighborhood [in Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Can you give us a sense of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: The sights and sounds and smells of growing up in a family of revolutionaries was to be exposed to all enriching experiences.  We had no down time.  We were challenged to involve ourselves with creative activities.  And our parents worked very hard at doing that.  To ensure that we were enriched to prepare us for our life's avocation.  And that's a fascinating focus that they had.  Now some of the current medical research suggests that this is one way to starve off Alzheimer's [Disease]. If you start being challenged intellectually early, less likely to develop Alzheimer's.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: If you don't use it, you lose it.
Speaker 1: I see. If you don't use it early enough you might lose it.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So what were some of the--what were some of the--what did--what was the neighborhood like?  What did it look like?  What did--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The neighborhood was well preserved.  This was a ghetto.  And segregation laws didn't allow purchasing of houses beyond a boundary of our ghetto. And because of that, it was well maintained.  Certainly not like it is today. Sure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it looked a lot better in those days than it does now.
Speaker 2: Sure
Speaker 1: And who were some of the I guess the other residents of the neighborhood that you remember--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Professionals.
Speaker 1: Mostly professionals?
Speaker 2: A mixture.  And I was born at home.  Actually I was delivered in my grandmother's house in this block.  And there were medical practitioners readily available.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now what did your household consist of?  I mean who did your household consist of basically?
Speaker 2: My mother [Juanita Elizabeth Mitchell Jackson] and father [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr.] and three brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what are their names?
Speaker 2: George Davis Mitchell, Michael Bowen Mitchell and Clarence Mitchell III.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what kind of--what were you like when you were a little boy?  What did you like to do?
Speaker 2: I was creative.  I enjoyed art related activity.  And I was enrolled in classes at the Baltimore Museum of Art. And a lot of effort was expended to enhance my interests in art.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Would you mostly draw and paint or?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you have any of your work?
Speaker 2: All displayed in the hall.
Story_ID: 10898
Speaker 1: Now where did you go to school here?
Speaker 2: I went to school at Henry Highland Garnet Elementary School [Baltimore, Maryland], and Booker T. [Washington] Junior High school [Baltimore, Maryland].  The elementary school was behind the block of row homes in which I grew up in. And the junior high school was in the middle-in the front of the block.  But in 1954, when the [Brown v. Board of Education Topeka, Kansas] Supreme Court decision came down desegregating schools, I was given the opportunity to integrate a predominately white middle school in a section of Northwest Baltimore.  And I went to that school and integrated that school.
Speaker 1: What was the name of that one?
Speaker 2: Gwynns Falls Park Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: Gwynns Falls Park.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Junior high school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You need a pen?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Thank you (laughing).  I'm (laughing) making a deep impression hoping that will--thank you.  But--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Okay.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about elementary school in this neighborhood first. And what was--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) It was a very enriching experience in that you had very qualified teachers with advanced degrees, who could not be employed in a broader educational system because of segregation.  The Baltimore school system was divided into black school administration and a white school administration.  And teachers were paid unequally.  White teachers made more, black teachers made less.  And so you had teachers with masters degrees who were--only had the opportunity in the segregated black schools in Baltimore.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now the name of your school, Henry Highland Garnet School.  Can you tell us who it was named for?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Henry Highland Garnet was a famous abolitionist.  Okay.  And I'll leave that to the readers to determine exactly what he did.  To challenge them to research it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: I don't want to serve it up.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: A black abolitionist Henry Highland Garnet.  Okay.  So well were there any particular teachers that took an interest in you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) All of them did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: One in particular in the second grade recognized my art ability, and encouraged my parents [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr. and Juanita Elizabeth Mitchell Jackson] to nurture that.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Do you remember the teacher's name?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I should, but I have resources archives.  And I have that readily available.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.  What were your favorite subjects in school other than art?  I mean do you--.
Speaker 2: Science.
Speaker 1: Science.  All right.
Speaker 2: Right Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. There--Any stories about Garnet School that you can tell us?  Any particular things happen there that--?
Speaker 2: No.  An enriching experience.
Speaker 1: Just a good school.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Story_ID: 10899
Speaker 1: Now what about Book T. Washington Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland]?
Speaker 2: It had a disparity of materials for education and was crowded. And after going to Gwynns Falls Park Junior High School [Baltimore, Maryland], that I integrated, I saw quite clearly the disparity in terms of smaller class size.  We had a larger supply of materials and a broader exposure.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was a big difference between the two.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You were the first generations to actually be able to--one of the first generation--among the first in a generation to see the difference between the two by attending both.  Right?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well my mother [Juanita Elizabeth Mitchell Jackson], she spent her first year at Morgan State College [Baltimore, Maryland, became Morgan State University in 1975] which wasn't accredited then. And my grandmother [Elsie Mitchell] enrolled her at University of Pennsylvania [Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]. And there she saw the difference quite dramatically.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now were there any particular teachers at Gwynns Falls [Junior High School] that took an interest in you?  Or did you--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The art teachers for the most part.  That was a safe haven to combat the racism that protested my presence.  I was beaten up by a mob of neighborhood toughs.  And they weren't ready to accept the idea that--of integration.
Speaker 1: Well how did all that make you feel?  I mean did you--did you miss Booker T. Washington?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well at the time it was very--No.  At the time I didn't miss Booker T. because it was very crowded and life had significant opportunities.  But the hostility wasn't as great as it was in that school.  But the thrill in going through that experience is that almost forty-five years later, my son represents that neighborhood in the Baltimore City Council. So in a sense I was paving the way for that process.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I mean did the school step in and try to protect you at all, or--?
Speaker 2: No.  My father [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr.] walked a one-man picket line in front of the school, a sign that said, "I am an American too."  And I invite the viewers to read the autobiography of his life entitled 'Lion in the Lobby', by Denton Watson.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) In that book, you'll see pictures of his one-man picket line protesting the neighbor, the neighbors around the school who were directing invectives at me.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now were you there as the sole representative of your family or the--?
Speaker 2: Sole African American.
Speaker 1: Okay.  In the whole school.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now your--the age differences with--where do you fall in the order of--in your family in terms of the sibling--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) My brother Clarence III is the eldest.  He's two years older.  I am next.  My brother Michael is four years younger.  And my brother George is ten years younger than I.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So I mean how--did you--was it difficult going to school every day under those circumstances?
Speaker 2: Quite difficult.  You know, We were in apartheid.  Very challenging experience.
Story_ID: 10900
Speaker 1: Let me ask you about the block busting again. So we can--,
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: --have that full, I guess, statement on tape. What about block busting in Baltimore [Maryland]? You were talking about the situation--.
Speaker 2: It's where previously all-white neighborhoods that had resisted integration had homes bought by speculators who brought in black families which in turn triggered white fright and flight.
Speaker 1: Sort of an acceleration of--accelerated.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes, sure.
Story_ID: 10901
Speaker 1: You're basically then sustained by your family and this sense of conviction, you know, from your family that you ought to stick out this junior high school experience [Gwynns Falls Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland] which was a, you know, it was a great opportunity. But it wasn't very pleasant. Did it ever get any better? I mean after it, I mean--?
Speaker 2: Toward the end of my last year. Okay. And it became somewhat better.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right.
Speaker 2: But the nurturing and the experience the materials that were involved in the art department enabled me to win a citywide art contest with a painting that depicted waiting passengers in a train station. And my mother pointed out to me what the crux of the issue was in terms of the damaging aspect of segregation that decided the 1954 Supreme Court decision [Brown v. Board of Education, Topeka, Kansas]. All of the people in the station that I painted had white faces. And [psychologist, civil rights activist] Kenneth Clark used that argument in terms of the damaging aspect of segregation in his doll experiment. And that showed the psychological impact. And Charles Houston who was the Dean of Howard University--Howard University Law School  [Washington, D.C.] who met regularly in my home with my parents [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr. and Juanita Elizabeth Mitchell Jackson] , formulating the strategy for the desegregation educationally in Baltimore, utilized that argument to successfully desegregate Baltimore school systems, in an afternoon. Which had taken the national effort many, many years to implement, at the Supreme Court level.
Story_ID: 10902
Speaker 1: So as a young man you--[Dean of Howard University Law School, Washington, D.C.] Charles Houston was a regular in the living room?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. [U.S. Supreme Court Justice] Thurgood Marshall. They were all activists along with my parents in the attempt to eliminate apartheid. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Any other notables around that you wanna mention to us sir?
Speaker 2: We grew up around notables.
Speaker 1: Did you realize they were notable when you were growing up?
Speaker 2: We accepted them as people and admired them for their achievements. In this building, that was known as the Wheatley House, I have documentation of the diplomas of the first physician who was an African-American who came here at the turn of the century. He finished Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] in 1894 and Howard's [University] medical school [Washington, D.C.] in 1898. And came here to live and practice in the room that we're sitting in. And he utilized other rooms as living space. But he has a room on the second floor--had a room on the second floor that he called his drawing room. In which all notable African American entertainers were entertained. Because of segregation not allowing them to be entertained downtown. Marian Anderson has sung up stairs. Paul Laurence Dunbar recited poetry, Phillis Wheatley recited poetry. So this was a mecca of renaissance. My mother [Juanita Elizabeth Mitchell Jackson] also who grew up in this block remembers as a child watching the notable African Americans of the day coming in by horse drawn carriage to be entertained by the Wheatleys. So that was the enriching experience of this neighborhood.
Story_ID: 10903
Speaker 1: Now where'd you go to high school?
Speaker 2: Baltimore City College [High School, Baltimore, Maryland].
Speaker 1: All right. And tell us about high school. Was that-was that as segregated as the middle school [Gwynns Falls Junior High School, Baltimore, Maryland]
Speaker 2: Integra-I went in '56 [1956] and graduated in '59 [1959]. I was very active in sports, football and track, as well as continuing art major, okay.
Speaker 1: All right. Was the-what was the population of Baltimore City College High School like?
Speaker 2: It was predominantly white.
Speaker 1: Okay. There were a few blacks in the school.
Speaker 2: Yes, sure.
Speaker 1: All right. And what did you-what position did you play in football?
Speaker 2: Tackle.
Speaker 1: Tackle okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. You think of a great big guy when you think of a tackle.
Speaker 2: I was pretty big then.
Speaker 1: Were you? All right. Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And what other sports? You ran track too?
Speaker 2: Didn't run. I threw the discus and the shot put.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: That's once again everything of a big man.
Speaker 2: Yeah, sure.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well how was Baltimore City College High School in terms of the academics here? Were they--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Superior. Prepared you well for college.
Speaker 1: Did you have any teachers there that served as--?
Speaker 2: The art teachers were generally mentors.
Speaker 1: So when you were in high school did you see yourself as becoming an artist? Or did-I mean you seem like--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. Yes.
Speaker 1: --you had a lot of success in art.
Speaker 2: Yes. But I had also a love of science and I decided that I would pursue science in college.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: All right. Did you have a sense that you'd be able to do your art anyway?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) yes. Always did--,
Speaker 1: All right.
Speaker 2: --in my spare time, leisure time.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. So did you achieve any I guess honors in high school?
Speaker 2: No. Not significant honors. No.
Story_ID: 10904
Speaker 1: When you were a senior in high school [Baltimore City College High School, Baltimore, Maryland] , I mean what-did you know, you know. You knew you were gonna pursue science, right? And did you know where you were gonna go to college?
Speaker 2: I hadn't really decided. But I chose Morgan State College [Baltimore, Maryland, now called Morgan State University] . And spent a year there. And recognized that the academic environment wasn't as conducive to pursue a science interest because of distractions. And I enrolled in my second year in my father's alma mater Lincoln University [Lincoln University, Pennsylvania] . Which at that time was all male. But had a reputation for a very challenging academic environment.
Speaker 1: Okay. So--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And I graduated in 1963. And then I was accepted by Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee and enrolled at Meharry and graduated in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now at Lincoln, now that was during the time of the--you were there during the time of the sit-in movement, the Freedom Rides? What--did you get involved in those kinds of activities?
Speaker 2: No. I was--I would participate in the sit-in activities in the summer breaks. In the summers of '59 [1959] and '60 [1960] and '61 [1961] my home in the 1300 block of Druid Hill [Baltimore, Maryland] was the staging ground for a lot of the sit-in movements. Young people were coming from all over the country camped out in our living room. And in the summer of '60 they desegregated forty restaurants in Baltimore and this was a very diverse group of students. White students as well as African-American students.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now you said--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) I was the--I painted the signs for the sit-in movements.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's interesting. I know how that is. That's--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: You said your brother was active in SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]. He was--was he one--Clarence Mitchell [III]?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right. Was he one of the original members of SNCC?
Speaker 2: Yes. One of the original members along with Jesse Jackson [sic, Jesse Jackson was not a member of SNCC but was involved with SCLC, Southern Christian Leadership Conference]
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Right. So people like [SNCC President] John Lewis and--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: And I guess--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.]. Right.
Speaker 1: Mm-hm. Okay. Now when you finished Lincoln you said you--now what other activities did you engage in at Lincoln? I don't wanna--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) The only sport that I participated in was track. Once again shot put and discus.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. And what was the social life like at Lincoln, you know?
Speaker 2: Well it was a all-male school but we--I was involved in the fraternity,  Kappa Alpha Psi and we would make our forays to Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] to recruit girls for our parties so that wasn't a handicap.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you always found girls that were willing to come to a party.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah, sure, sure.

Speaker 1: Well how did you choose Meharry [Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]? Well I guess in those days there weren't very many medical schools to choose from for African American students anyway.
Speaker 2: That was before the '64 Civil Rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964]. In which my father [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr.] working with [U.S. President] Lyndon Johnson insisted that the clause be put in that bill that said institutions that receive federal funding could not segregate. And that decision opened up all of the medical schools to African Americans throughout the country. For instance in Baltimore [Maryland] the first African-American to graduate from Johns Hopkins [University] medical school [Baltimore, Maryland] was in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay. Three years after the--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Right.
Speaker 1: --desegregation.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you graduated from Lincoln [University, Oxford, Pennsylvania] in--was it '62 [1962]?
Speaker 2: '63 [1963].
Speaker 1: '63, all right.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: And started Meharry. Nashville [Tennessee] was really one of the centers for the SNCC [Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] activity at one point and time.
Speaker 2: yes. But we were very focused in graduate school. We knew what our mission was to finish within the prescribed time of finishing and to absorb as much in the way of academic subject matter to enable us to fulfill our career goal.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: While there I met my wife Nanette Kindle, K-I-N-D-L-E, at--who was attending Fisk University [Nashville, Tennessee]. And we married in 1967. And I came to Baltimore to do my internship at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center [Baltimore, Maryland]. As well as my residency, a three-year residency in internal medicine at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center and a two year fellowship at The Johns Hopkins Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland] in gastroenterology. And while there during my fellowship, I served as mentor to all of the black medical students as well as I served on the admissions committee of the [Johns] Hopkins [University] medical school for eight years.
Story_ID: 10906
Speaker 1: Who were some of the teachers and doctors who were mentors to you during medical school [Meharry Medical College, Nashville, Tennessee]?
Speaker 2: All were mentors--,
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because they recognized the effects of segregation would put increasing demand on the graduates of a predominantly black medical school. And so they endowed us with academic excellence to be able to be successful in our professional careers.
Speaker 1: And did you attend the March on Washington [for Jobs and Freedom, Washington, D.C.] in '63 [1963]?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yes. It was the summer before entering medical school.
Speaker 1: All right. Okay. All right. Now at Johns Hopkins [University, Baltimore, Maryland], you said you were mentor to many of the of the medical students, black students.
Speaker 2: Yes. I was the black student advisor in the Johns Hopkins medical school from 1971 to 1973.
Speaker 1: All right. So school was pretty, was it pretty easy for you? In terms of--well you had a background as an artist. You know. Well you did science too. But you, did you find it easy?
Speaker 2: It was a very con--it was a conditioning process that once you understood that everyone else had a system, a routine of study, you adjusted to that, and you were able to accomplish all that was necessary to absorb the information that was presented to you.
Speaker 1: Okay. All right. Okay. How did you decide to go into gastrointestinal medicine?
Speaker 2: During my last year of residency [Greater Baltimore Medical Center, Baltimore, Maryland], I looked at the statistical significance of problems presenting to a general medical clinic that had gastrointestinal connotation. And decided to choose that as a fellowship [The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland].
Story_ID: 10907
Speaker 1: Did you have an idea that those [gastrointestinal] problems were not being addressed in the black community basically?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right. Okay.  Are there any particular problems--gastrointestinal problems that black people have that would--?
Speaker 2: No. Disease is not unique to race. But my grandmother Lillie M. Jackson--who directed the Baltimore [Maryland] branch of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] for thirty-five years who was instrumental in stripping apartheid of the hiring practices of the city, ensuring that teachers would get equal salary, and hiring the first black policemen, the first black fireman, instituting black cabdrivers, instituting black gas and electric company employees--had always admonished us growing up that you had to be aware of your contribution to society. One of her favorite witticisms was, "They may foreclose on your mortgage. They may repossess your car. But they can never take away a first class education." So she insisted on academic excellence. Once you had attained that, she also insisted that you give back to the community. And so she admonished all of us that service to people is the rent you pay for your space on earth. And as long as you remain a part of the people, you'll be successful. If you feel that you are above the people, you won't be successful. And that advice influenced where I located my practice in a section of the city with the greatest need and became very successful in my practice based on my grandmother's principles. And that simply said, if you had a profes--if you have a profession, you can't isolate your services from people. You have to go where the people are.  And you will be very successful economically. You choose otherwise and more affluent surrounds, you won't be as successful. Very practical advice.
Story_ID: 10908
Speaker 1: I was asking you earlier about gastrointestinal problems that black people might have and others may not have. And you said that there not--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Well the only entity--
Speaker 1: --specific to race--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously)--that I interacted with in my research at [The Johns] Hopkins [Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland]--I was a Macy Foundation fellow at Hopkins was lactose intolerance. And there's a high prevalence in African Americans, Ashkenazi Jews, people from the Orient.  But some very elegant studies have looked at the expression of the gene for lactose intolerance. And looked at an example of two tribes in Africa. One was a cattle grower for generations. And they were lactose intoler--they were lactose tolerant. And the other tribe separated by less than a hundred miles away were vegetables growers. And they were lactose intolerant. So there you have two African tribes to show that it may not be race related. Okay.
Speaker 1: And it certainly is a fact that a lot of black people in this country, African Americans are lactose intolerant, as well as Orientals.
Speaker 2: Right. Ashkenazi Jews.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Does it--I mean this is a--.
Speaker 2: But the lactose intolerance is not really significant. It--they did some experiments in which children in schools were offered milk. And we did randomly determined whether they were--they would refuse milk because of adverse side effects. And they would. So--and we measured absorption of lactose, in terms of blood sugar curves. And it wasn't that severe. It can over a period of time get more pronounced.
Speaker 1: You mean as you get older--,
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --it gets worse. I see. Okay. I've heard people say in the black community that they can't drink milk anymore. I can't eat  ice cream anymore--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Not all, not all African Americans are lactose intolerant.
Speaker 1: No. But people do say that a lot. They say, now that I'm this old I can't do this anymore.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Any--yeah--well--my--I have a scientific approach. I don't--I focus on who actually has it and who doesn't.
Speaker 1: Yeah I think percentages--.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) And that--this is not a connotation to be addressed by race, okay.  There're too many efforts that go on now that tend to focus on race related health problems to categorize African Americans as some how quite different than other ethnic groups. And that 's not true.
Speaker 1: Well in, okay--in some respects people are different, you know, in terms of what they can tolerate and cannot if recently--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Not race related.
Speaker 1: --this morning there was a report on the 'Today' show that 80 percent of Asian Americans are lactose intolerant.
Speaker 2: Well, I think that you have to be very careful in that we label race related health problems and failed to look at the other factors that are associated with the expression of the genetics involved in that. And that's why I gave you the example of the two African tribes.
Speaker 1: Okay. But, you know that--sometimes it is sig--there's some significance to it.
Speaker 2: Lactose intolerance just gives gas. It does not cause malabsorption or weight loss or failure to thrive.
Story_ID: 10909
Speaker 1: Are there, there any diet related problems that--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Oh a tremendous amount--,
Speaker 1: --occur?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) they are related to poverty. The lack of access to healthy foods for economic reasons.
Speaker 1: Okay.  What kinds of foods cause the most problems in our community?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) High fat content.
Speaker 1: Like McDonalds foods or fast foods?
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: French-fries, that sort of thing.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Burgers.
Speaker 2: Mm-hm.
Speaker 1: Okay. Anything else? I mean is there--what affect does drinking have on one's gastrointestinal system?
Speaker 2: Well as I often remind people, as I sit and talk or interact with them, and they come forth with opinions as it relates to medical issues, this is a very complicated process in assessing cause and effect in terms of many disease entities. And I wouldn't want to leave the viewer with the impression that I could glibly summarize some of the significant health related problems in so far as alcohol, tobacco without steering them in the direction to utilize educational resources to find out about themselves and what impacts them. I would encourage them to read, visit libraries, pay attention to public health forums that are readily available that can give in-depth discussions of health-related concerns that would impact them.
Story_ID: 10910
Speaker 1: What about your civil rights activities? You know, since you've been a doc--you know, since you've  been out of school and--?
Speaker 2: Well I've been very involved in a lot of professional organizations. I served as president of a medical staff of a predominantly African American hospital--Provident Hospital [Baltimore, Maryland].  And different organizations that were prominent in the community.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Do you have any, any stories you wanna tell us about of civil rights activities or civil life?
Speaker 2: Well the big activity that we were involved in medically was ensuring equal participation in all health related concerns. There were efforts to exclude African American health care providers from major health initiatives. And mainstream health care and ensuring that that did not continue to occur.
Speaker 1: Okay. Are there any significant breakthroughs in this regard? I mean, that you could tell us about?
Speaker 2: Initially there were. But the clock has been turned back in terms of the number of African American health care providers in the mainstream declining and members of medical staffs of hospitals. So much so that we have to make a concerted effort to create a balance.
Speaker 1: Okay. So it seems to be a paucity of black medical students now?
Speaker 2: Well they aren't readily encouraged once they finish medical school to become a part of the mainstream--the economic mainstream in medicine, in terms of participating in hospital staffs throughout communities.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what are they doing as--I mean what are they doing?
Speaker 2: Some go for full time jobs and don't op for private practice.
Speaker 1: Okay. They--the proliferation of--has the proliferation of HBOs--I mean HM--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) That's hasn't made a--,
Speaker 1: HMOs--[Health Maintenance Organization].
Speaker 2: --made a significant difference. There's not an active recruitment of African American health care providers by those organizations.
Speaker 1: It seems that a significant number of doctors in the black community around the country are foreign born. There--it may be true for everywhere. You know, from Pakistan and other places. It used to be there was a significant neighborhood presence of black doctors. Rather than--it seems like that's declining these days. Do you share that? I mean--I mean that's just a general observation though. It's not anything scientific. But--.
Speaker 2: Well I came through an era of segregation when health care professionals were mandated to apply their trade in a segregated society. And then with integration, they were able to go places they previously were barred from going to. And in that void, as they left in the neighborhoods, other immigrant groups came in to fill that void. There's a new racism even on the part of African Americans who look suspiciously at other ethnic groups who come into urban centers to provide health care services as some how being a part of the big conspiracy. That's not true.
Speaker 1: Okay. But are the numbers of black physicians declining?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: As is the number of minority enrollment in centers of higher education.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well can we do anything about it?
Speaker 2: By fixing the educational system at an early age that provides the academic excellence to allow people bound in urban areas to get the tools necessary to compete.
Speaker 1: Okay. What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African-American community?
Speaker 2: My hopes rest with my father's [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr.] philosophy in his battle to implement the civil rights laws. To create the level playing field where you are judged fit to participate economically based on your skills.
Story_ID: 10911
Speaker 1: At this juncture when you look back on your life and you're not that old.
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Sixty-two.
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's young. Do you--what do you see as your legacy?
Speaker 2: Service to people is the rent you pay for your space on earth. My grandmother's [Lilly Carroll Jackson] admonition. You must be involved. And I try to be involved in the fabric of the community to make a contribution.
Speaker 1: Okay. One last question. It's similar to legacy. But, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: I will let history judge that. I'm working on a project now in which I'm archiving photographs of a current family generation and their activities so that future generations can look at these archives and determine by example a choice to participate in the mainstream of society. And with that reference, I think it will be quite useful. And that in itself will be remembrance of having documented who we were and what we were about. And this is why I'm very active politically as treasurer of my family's political campaigns. And also I do all of the major photography for the campaigns. And this is a part of giving of one's talents to another generation.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And as an artist, and a doctor, a photographer and I guess an athlete on some levels--,
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) Yeah.
Speaker 1: --you made contributions. What do you plan in the future? Is there anything that you--?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneously) To remain in the trenches. And to continue to contribute. And to try to improve the quality of life for all I interact with.
Story_ID: 10912
Speaker 1: This is a very historic photograph of the beginning of the battle for the '64 Civil Rights bill [Civil Rights Act of 1964] as it came up for vote in Congress. And everyone is laughing in this photograph. As represented in the photograph [administrator, social activist] Dorothy Height, [civil rights and labor movement activist] A. Phillip Randolph, [Dr.] Martin Luther King [Jr.] and my father [Clarence Murice Mitchell, Jr.] in the foreground. And I asked him what were they laughing about. And [U.S. President Lyndon] Johnson relayed the story growing up in Texas when he had a mean school teacher who directed the one room schoolhouse. And Johnson decided that along with his friends to beat him up after school. And they all agreed and hid under a railroad trestle waiting for the teacher. And as the teacher approached, he seemed to be getting bigger. Johnson jumped out and grabbed him and he looked around and his friends ran. And Johnson said that teacher wore the tar out of him. And so Johnson was saying we're getting ready to whip the teacher and get the Civil--'64 Civil  Rights bill passed. Don't run out.  And that captures it as you can see in terms of the historic figures represented.
Speaker 2: That's Hubert Humphrey.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: A. Phillip Randolph.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: [NAACP, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Executive Director] Roy Wilkins.
