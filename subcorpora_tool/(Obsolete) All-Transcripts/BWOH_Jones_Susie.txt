Dr. Merze Tate:	This is Professor Merze Tate in Greensboro,
North Carolina, at 716 Gorrell Street, the pleasant and gracious home of Mrs. Susie Jones, widow of President David D. Jones, recording something of her life's history. The setting is most appropriate for this occasion, a period early American, one might say, home, early American furniture in the dining area where we are, and attractive furnishings throughout the home.
It is indeed a pleasure for me to be here today. I have memories of receptions held here when I was teaching at Bennett in the 1930s, and indeed it is a great joy to spend this afternoon and part of tomorrow recording Mrs. Susie Jones for the black history of our distinguished women.
Mrs. Jones, it might be well if we would start with your roots, since roots are now so important in people's lives. You may wish to inform us of your parents, where you were born (you do not have to give us the exact date if you do not care to) and something of your early childhood, and then you'll go on to your brothers and sisters.
Mrs. Susie W. Jones:	My mother and father graduated from Berea College,
receiving their bachelor's degrees. I do not know much about my father's family. His mother died early and so my knowledge is fragmented, with just the stories that have come down through the family. But my mother's mother had great influence on my life, and on the lives of my sisters and brother. She was the slave of a Presbyterian minister, and it was his custom to read to his wife every evening. He always insisted on my grandmother sitting there, listening to him, and so she learned to read and was a great reader all her life. When my two oldest children were about three and four, I took them to see her, and she recited for us, sitting in her rocking chair on the frontporch, all of Byron's Prisoner of Chillon. She had a great love for English and Irish literature. I think you can understand why she felt it was important for her daughter to go to college.﻿2
SWJ:	(cont.) My mother started her college work at Allegheny, where she
had an uncle living, and then transferred to Berea, and there she met my father. This was in the early days of Berea. She knew Mr. Fee. President Fairchild was president of the college at that time. When my youngest son went to Andover, his teacher said to him, "You are the best prepared Latin student that I have had in years. Where did you study your Latin?" His reply was, "My grandmother." He had studied with his grandmother while in high school.
I was born in Danville, Kentucky, April 30, 1892. This was my grandmother's home. It was our custom every year, as soon as school was dismissed, to go to Danville and spend the summer. We always went on the train from Cincinnati, Ohio, because my mother insisted that we were interstate travelers, and this meant we did not have to use the segregated coaches. I did not understand this at that time, but I can remember that she would often have arguments with the conductor as to where we would sit.
I am the oldest child in my family. I had one brother and two sisters. The two sisters are still living. One is Mrs. James E. Stamps of Chicago, and the other is Miss Frances Williams of Saint Louis, Missouri. We do not see each other as often as we would like, but we do keep in touch by correspondence, telephone, and yearly visits.
My father was in education. As I was growing up, in my earliest life, he was a teacher in Louisville, Kentucky. Later he became principal of the high school in Covington, Kentucky. This was a very significant event in our lives, because he immediately enrolled in the University of Cincinnati for advanced work. In the summers he conducted institutes for teachers. These were the forerunners of our present summer schools. This was the reason we spent every summer with my grandmother in Danville, Kentucky.
We all looked forward to going to visit Grandmother, because my mother was a very practical woman, and she had many interests in the community as well as the responsibilities of her home. We lived a very simple life; we had a very simple upbringing. But Grandmother did not feel that way about it. She felt that all of our underskirts should have lace sewed on them, and that it was important for children to have a party every summer. She brought lots of glamour into our lives. I think I have heard my sisters say and I know I have said often to myself, "I do hope I can grow old gracefully as Grandmother did." The young people always enjoyed coming in and out of her home. We had young cousins who lived in Lexington, Kentucky, and they often came to Danville. For us, Danville was a wonderful place; besides, it was a small town and we could go downtown by ourselves.
My formal education started early, with kindergarten at three years old. I often think about it, with the present-day health problems. We never had any of the childhood diseases, and we never went to a doctor. My father had a little black box, and he took care of all of our ailments with white pills, and the medicine that was prescribed for the particular thins that troubled us. I attended the elementary and high schools in Louisville and Covington, Kentucky. When I graduated from the William Grant High School of Covington, Kentucky, I then went to Woodward High﻿3
(cont.) School in Cincinnati for one year, then to the University of Cincinnati, from which I graduated. I have had summer study at Chicago and summer study at Columbia.
May I interrupt to ask a question? In those early years of your life, which are very interesting, and put you in a very high cultural level, did you ever feel a disadvantage in being colored?
Well, I have thought about that in these late years. My first experience in race was when the Negro students, because of the day law that was passed by the legislature in Kentucky, were put out of Berea. Lincoln Institute was established for them. Some of the Negro graduates of Berea protested this. My father was leader of the group that protested, so my first racial experience was hearing very heated discussions on this matter. The President at that time was Dr. Frost. He came to our house several times to meet with this group to try to work out a satisfactory arrangement, but this never was realized. Although in these late years under Dr. Hutchins, Berea opened again her doors to Negro students, my mother never forgave them, and so she never made a contribution to the college. My father did give, but she did not. Because you would probably rememb er, that Berea was founded for Negroes and mountain whites, she felt that they had in such a large way betrayed their heritage.
My own racial experiences did not start...in my home. We talked a great deal at mealtime, but we were never allowed to describe anybody by the color of their skin. My father was adamant on things like this. On the other hand, just as I have told you about the experience of the railroad trips to my grandmother's home, I am sure we were protected from any kind of experience that would have been hard for us as children. It is interesting in this period when we are so conscious of our roots, that I never knew exactly what connection we had with the white people in our grandmother's home that might have been part of our family. My younger sister has more knowledge of this area. I can remember, however, as a child, every year we were dressed and we were taken to see Mrs. Quisenberry. We always went to the front door, because this was a formal call on Mrs. Quisenberry. There was a Negro friend who had worked in the Quisenberry family for many years. This family was connected with Centre College in Danville, Kentucky, which is one of the oldest colleges in the country. When we went to see Aunt Sophie, our Negro friend, this was another matter. We did not go to see her very often. She would come to my grandmother's house to see us and spend the day.
At Woodward High School, I am sure there was quite a tradition there, not only for a certain type of education, but for relationships of students and faculty. President Taft graduated from this school. The teachers I had there were, by and large, very elderly teachers. I remember our Latin teacher, a Mr. Peabody from Boston Latin School, had been teaching there for years. A classmate whose sister had read Virgil's Aeneid under him, had written out all of the difficult constructions in the book so she, before Mr. Peabody would even ask the question, would say underneath her breath the answer. Then I can remember when I graduated, there was a homeroom teacher, an elderly Miss Fillmore. She wanted our names for our diplomas.﻿4
(cont.) She gave us quite a talk one morning about the importance of our names on the diplomas, no fancy spelling, no derived names, the real name since this was an important document. I had no idea she was talking to me, and one day as I passed her desk she said to me, "Now is your name Susie or Susan?" My grandmother's name was Susan. I have a cousin who was named Sue, and my real name is Susie, so I had to explain to Miss Fillmore how this was a family name and how we had changed it.
The days at Woodward, you can understand, had certain adjustments that had to be made because I was entering the senior class. I was just doing over one year so I could qualify for entrance to the university. Of course, most of the students had been with each other through all of their high school experiences. But I was reasonably happy. I did not feel that I had any particular problems. I think our parents had been successful in bringing us up with an acceptance of people as people, and this was the important thing. We had certain normal situations - with people of the white race, but I never was particularly impressed with what color they were, or whether they were Negroes or whites. In the yearbook, the comment under my picture read: Susie believes in our class motto, Esse quam videri.
Our parents were very anxious, as far as their means allowed, to give us experiences of enrichment that were wider in scope than life in this small Kentucky town. One of our Christmas presents was always a season ticket to the Unity (not the religious group) lectures, given in Cincinnati on Sunday afternoons during the fall and winter. We heard prominent leaders in the country. Through this kind of an experience, and attending political meetings in Cincinnati involving national politics, we had a feeling of world outreach.
We had an uncle, my mother's brother, who was a very sought-after caterer in Cincinnati. He and his wife added a great deal to our lives. They thought it was important for us to have kid gloves and simple jewelry that every girl appreciates. He had great love for his family and was mindful of them. When there was a big party, he would send some of the party food to us, because they not only prepared the major meal, but made their own ice creams and pastries. On the Fourth of July he would always come and spend the day with us. This meant we could go up to the store and buy as many fireworks as we wished. I must tell you this because this gives you another indication of care. I have my grandmother's cups and saucers he sent her. They are old Haviland, and during our summers at Danville, one of the things Grandmother did always was to entertain her club.
What kind of a club was it? Literary?
Not 1 iterary, it was just a club of the friends, you know, a social club. And for this club, my uncle would send her either pastries or strawberries, or whatever she wanted from Cincinnati. He would send them by porters on the train, and we would go down and pick them up.
MT:
That made her party especially elegant.﻿5
Made her club meeting especially elegant. My grandmother was a very good seamstress, and she did beautiful handwork. Every year during the winter months, she would make her mother a cap to wear. One of our jobs, when we came in the summer, was to go out, we call it, "go out to the hill," where my great-grandmother lived, to carry her this cap.
So coming back to your question, the matter of race did not really hit me until I went to college. Although there were just a very few Negroes who attended the University of Cincinnati at that time, it was largely a municipal college. It had no dormitories, and so the students came from the Cincinnati area, and if not immediately from Cincinnati, from some of the smaller Kentucky towns- One of the most outstanding irritations that I suffered was that an English teacher, who was from the North, left a vacant seat on both sides of me. I went to the head of the department and complained about this. After our initial conversation, he sent for me to come back. Dr. Miller did not want me to transfer; he wanted me to stay in the class. This was a very difficult experience for me, but not difficult enough to deter me in any way. When it was necessary to use the same material, or if I wanted to see somebody else's notebook, or they wanted to see mine, we would just move in the seats of our own accord, and so it did not deter me, but it really was my most unpleasant experience in college.
When I graduated, I had persuaded my father, who was not easy to persuade, to let me go to the University of Chicago for a summer session, so that I could graduate early. He granted this request. There, too, I found discrimination of a different kind, people not willing to even answer simple questions. I later found out that there were a great many Southerners who came for the summer session, and I am sure unfriendliness was more or less common because there were a great many Negroes attending the summer sessions. So my racial experiences came along at the time of life that I was mature. I must have taken them in stride as most Negroes do, and worked with them when I could. I always had enough pleasant experiences to outbalance those that were difficult. I never felt persecuted and I really never felt that I couldn't do anything I wanted to do because of race. Does that answer your question?
Yes, and it's very similar to my experiences that I'll not recount here. In college, particularly.
Yes, well, I would think...Now I'm a good bit older than you are, but I would think that those of us who grew up in a more or less protected environment, where we did not have to use public transportation, where we did not have to...Now I can remember my mother on this, you just never bought anything at a store where the clerks were in any ways rude to you; you go to another store, because there were plenty of stores where they were kind and gracious to you. And my grandmother's home, although it was right in the heart of the bluegrass, she had a horse and buggy and so you know you weren't up against a lot of things that some people had to contend with.
I think that — I don't quite know how to say this—but I think that as I grew older and began to understand more of the system, and what was happening in our world, I began to feel that I must do whatever I could to﻿6
SWJ:	(cont.) work on this matter. I will come back a little later to
this, but I was able to work on this matter in the church, in the Methodist church, and in the United Council of Church Women, where there were both white and Negro women working together for solutions. This was a most exciting experience. I also was here in Greensboro for the first sit-ins, and marched and participated in all of the activities that were a part of this movement in Greensboro, North Carolina.
MT:	Very interesting experience, extremely so. Now obviously, I have
been wondering, was it in your college days or after, that you met your husband?
SWJ:	This is why going to the University of Chicago proved a very significant
event in my life. This was the time I met Mr. Jones. He has often teased me about this, because he asked me what X was studying, and of course I was an undergraduate, and he has since told me that he did not understand why I didn't pay my own carfare since my father had sent me there, and also that he really felt sorry for me 'cause I looked like I'd come from the country. [laughter] And so then when I asked him what school he was attending, he said he was in the graduate school, so this gave me a chance to level him down a little bit and laugh at him because he felt so superior to me because he was in the graduate school, and I was still to graduate from college. But we met that summer. There were many interesting people there. The first time I went out with him, he invited me to go to church. This was the day of ostrich plumes, and I had a large straw hat that had an ostrich plume on it, and when we came home, I couldn't remember, but I had a deep feeling that I had gone to sleep in church and I wondered what a spectacle I must have been, with this ostrich plume jumping up and down, nodding. But I never knew, because he gave me no indication until the following winter. At that time, he was a student worker in the YMCA; he was in Texas. And so he wrote me that he had been to hear one of the speakers at one of the chapels, who had been at Chicago University that summer, and talked about how dull the Sunday service was at the chapel because the speaker was trying to discredit the old interpretations of the Bible. He added to this, "Just think, way down here in Texas I found somebody who went to sleep like you did." [laughter]
MT:	That's the first time you knew that you had really gone to sleep?
SWJ:	Then I knew that this had really happened. In my married life, I was
always interested in the YWCA, and I inherited this from my mother, because she was very prominent in the YWCA in Saint Louis, and served on an advisory committee of the national YWCA. But the women's movements, except the League of Women Voters, and this was an organization that I belonged to for a good many years, were not as clearly defined, in focus or in activities as they are today. And so I have a mixed feeling about the women's movement, not that I am specifically against them, but I feel that there are some strategies that are questionable... I have been amazed how this struggle has paralleled our racial experiences. I think that what we do in these movements is so dependent upon the kinds of people that we are, and I don't think that I have been over-aggressive in the area of race because that's just not my nature. I can remember a man came in my house one day (I can't remember just why he was there) but he had﻿7
(cont.) his hat on and I asked him to take off his hat, please, and so I dropped my voice and he took it off. Then I can remember when we lived in Atlanta, I volunteered to take nursery school children to the clinic at Grady Hospital. Registration cards had to be made out for each child and the woman who was head of this part of the work asked me one day, what was my name, and I said, "My name is Mrs. Jones." She replied, "We do not call Negroes by titles." I suggested that she not use my name because I would be uncomfortable if she attempted to use my first name. Her reply was, "I will call you what you wish. I can't let you be more polite than I."
I think maybe I should go back a little bit and say something in regard to my education, that I neglected to say, and that is that just as race was not emphasized in my family, neither was the matter of sex. My father was a principal of a public high school; he had both men and women as faculty members, and so I never felt there was any question about my identity as a woman. I never grew up feeling that there should be preferences. Just as in race, I acquired a deeper knowledge of the race issue as I grew older, so I became conscious of the problem of women. But my marriage also reinforced this idea, because Mr. Jones worked in areas where there were both men and women working side by side. And in the church organizations, women were autonomous in both groups I worked with; nevertheless, we were related to the major church and we always felt that we were a part of the larger church. In the Methodist Church, my work was largely under the Board of Missions of the Methodist Church, and on this larger board there were men who participated in the decisions of the Church.
Now in the midst of all of this, you must remember, I am a mother, and I had four children. My activities were always limited by the fact that I had these youngsters who had to have time, and so I really didn't become active in the church work until they were grown, and in many instances they were not even living at home. My husband, David Dallas Jones, once wrote:
Too, from the outset, my wife and I have had the feeling that no matter what else we did in life, we had to devote our best thinking and our best living to our children. Now that they are all grown, we have sincere satisfaction in the fact that trying to do a job and trying to earn a living did not take away from us this urgency to be and do so that our children could have a feeling of the importance of integrity, honesty and straightforwardness in life. It seems to me far too often this is overlooked.*

SWJ:	(cont.) I had been so busy with the affairs of my family that I
remember stopping in Washington on my way to New York to my first meeting with the Methodist women, talking with my younger sister, Frances, about some of the issues that were going to be discussed. She said to me, "Now I know how timid you are. So at this first meeting, you just stand up and speak. It doesn't matter whether you make sense or not, but you've got to learn how to get up on your feet and express yourself, or else you'll never be an effective member." And while I was increasing my knowledge of national and world affairs, I was also learning lots, and so I have been deeply indebted to the church for this type of experience. There were many thrilling experiences. For instance, when the scientists made the first atom bomb, the United Council of Church Women were holding a meeting in Washington. A small group was invited to come to the Capitol, and Dr. Urey of Chicago University explained to us how responsible the scientists felt because this discovery could help or destroy the world. He challenged church women to be active in understanding and helping the scientists in the larger education of the people that was necessary at this particular time in world history. Now, shall I go back to the children?
MT:	Yes, if you wish, or did you, you were mentioning sort of your attitude,
your work with the women's movement earlier. Did you want to say any more about that, it ties in with this Methodist church work.
SWJ:	Yes, well I don't think I was...I think I was saying that I don't feel
critical of the women's movement in any way. I realize, for instance, this whole matter of discrimination in employment, discrimination in salary, discrimination in advancement, and I realize all of this, and I think life has become so complicated that we cannot depend on these things happening. I think we have to, just as people want to feel that everybody in the world is treated all right, nobody is discriminated against because of their color, and we talk a great deal about the brotherhood of man, or like to think that everybody is well fed, we can't bear to think...and yet there is such a large part of the world where there is always hunger. So I feel that it is important, since women are moving out into the mainstream of life, and our home responsibilities have become less, I do think it is important that they be supported by non-discrimination of all kinds. In many ways I am very grateful for the movement, but at the same time, as I have seen some of it from the sideline, which is quite different from being responsible for things, I have felt that there were certain things in our struggle for rights that we did not want to lose out on. Just as Mr. Hooks, present director of the NAACP, was saying in his "Face the Nation" interview, that he was dedicated, he wanted liberty for everybody, but he was committed to seeking it out for people who had been deprived, I feel strongly that the struggle for racial equality and the struggle for women's rights have been two parallel struggles in American life.
Now you mentioned you had to delay your civic and religious, Methodist church activities, until the children were at least perhaps in high school. It wasn't when they were away in college?﻿9
SWJ:
HT:
MT: SWJ:
SWJ:
When this t ime came, we had come to Bennett College—a college for women. Now there was no question about our daughter attending Bennett College. Mr. Jones had a strong feeling that if Bennett College could not give our daughter an education, then it couldn't give anybody an education. There were three boys in the family. David graduated from high school here, and then we had some question about his succeeding in college, so finally decided that it would be wise for him to put in a year at a New England prep school. Now the first school we considered was Wilbraham, a small Methodist prep school in the East. They wrote, after they had accepted his papers and looked at his background, that they did not accept Negro students. Mr. Jones went to Phillips [Andover] Academy, with which he had no connection, and which was a larger and more prestigious school, and found out that the dean there was a graduate of Wesleyan University, from which he had graduated. He asked him very frankly if they accepted Negro students. This was very important for us because this Wilbraham turndown did not happen until late summer when it's almost too late to make new arrangements. But Dean Lynde, who was then dean of Phillips, said they would be glad to have David, and offered him a scholarship. And so he had a very pleasant experience there and went to Wesleyan, volunteered for the army, and after the war graduated from Harvard Law School. Now, as you know, he died this fall, and I thought maybe you might be interested, and I won't go further into this, but you might be interested in the write-up of his life that the New York Times carried, and the service at the Syracuse University Chapel where he was a special assistant to the President.
Do you have the date of that article? The New York Times, we can judge later.
SWJ: Yes.
MT:	That was the first information I received after I registered at the
Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History last October in Chicago. Someone came up to me and they said, "Did you know about David Jones?"
SWJ:	Yes, his service was at that time.
Yes, and they told me and then of course it was known widely, and I was quite shocked.
You know my sister, Mrs. Stamps, the one that lives in Chicago, her husband was one of the founders, with Carter Woodson, of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History.
Of the Association?
Yes, of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History.
And what is his full name?
SWJ:
His name is James Edwin Stamps.﻿10
MX:	Yes. Now, of course David was the elder of the boys.
SWJ:	And at this time, we had decided that we would send the two younger
boys to prep school. So Frank, the youngest, spent a time in Saint Louis with my mother and father and went to school there. Paul, my second boy, went to Northfield.* Frank later went to Andover. Paul went into the navy and studied for a while, but did not graduate from Boston University after he finished his service with the navy.
MT:	With the army or navy?
SWJ:	Navy.
MT:	Was he in any special branch of the navy? He wasn't in the marines?
SWJ: ^ No. He always felt he'd gotten cheated, because the other	two boys served abroad. He spent his time in Staten Island, in the harbor of New York,
[laughter] And so he felt the navy hadn't been as good to	him, as it had been to the other boys.
MT.	Then what did he do?
SWJ:	I'm coming back to Frances, because we got off a little bit on that.
MX:	Well, you were taking care of the young men, because you felt Frances
could get basic education in a women's college.
SWJ:	Well, right here. But we thought that she needed to have something
special done for her, because she was going to stay here for her education, and so she had a year in France between high school, before she entered college. She had a year in France, and studied at Grenoble. She then entered Bennett College, and received her bachelor of arts degree from the college. Strangely enough, because our family had largely been interested in education, she was wishing to study medicine. We had on the campus at this time a young woman, a Negro woman doctor. Frances was very fond of her, and we were a little apprehensive about whether Frances understood what an arduous task medicine is. So we agreed with her that she would go to Boston and get a master's degree in science and therv if she still wanted to be a doctor at the end of that time, she could do so. Boston University would not accept her application as a medical student, and so this entered into that decision too.
One of her teachers, under whom she was working, had the members of the class present papers. When she presented her paper, he asked her where she graduated from and she said, "You perhaps would not know the school. It's a small college for Negro women in Greensboro, North Carolina." And he said to her, "I noticed that you have not sent in your problem that you are intending to work on for your master's dissertation." She replied, "You know, I really am not interested in getting a master's degree. I wanted to take medicine, but they would not admit me."
* Mount Hermon School for Boys﻿11
SWJ:	(cont.) Then he said to her, "Did you ever have any training in
public speaking and things like that?" She said, "No, but you know, around a small college you get to do many things." Then she said, "I belonged to the drama club and things of that type, but I really wanted to take medicine." And he said, "Well, I'll see that you get in. I'm on the admissions committee," and so she entered the Boston University Medical School.
And I can remember the first time she came home, she got in at night and we had gone to bed, and she came in to talk. She was telling us everything at once. When she told us good night, Mr. Jones said to me, "What was the most significant thing that she said?" And I said, "Well, to me the most significant thing she said was about the girls she was studying with." And we had deep satisfaction in this because Boston Medical School* had originally been a women's college, and women were accepted there. She had a racial experience, but once she was in, she found, and there must have been ten or twelve girls in her class, she found this group of girls. They lived at that time together at Franklin Square House. And when I hear about some of the young women today, and their struggle with their male colleagues, I realize what a blessing it was for her.
MT:	Did President Jones have any idea of what was the most important thing
she had said?
SWJ:
MT:
MT: SWJ:
Yes, he thought the same thing because we...Well, one of the reasons we sent her there was because we thought it was an atmosphere that would be open to women, and so that this in a way vindicated our judgment. She graduated from there, and now she will say that she got certain breaks because of the war, and I think half of this is true, a great part of it may be true. On the other hand, I am sure that some of the things that happened to her, she earned by her zeal for her work and her great interest. She had wonderful contacts. She worked with Dr. Cobb, who was then the leading psychiatrist at Massachusetts General Hospital. Her life has moved on in this professionally during these years, in addition to her two children. Now I would come back to the second boy, shall we?
Yes, and what he finally did, and al so Frank; of course we teachers call him Frankie.
SWJ:	That is right. Well, Paul came out of the navy, enrolled at Boston University,
and found it very difficult to settle down to routine life. And so he dropped out, I think it was in his junior year, or maybe the last part of his senior year, and went to work in New York City. He has done well; he is now the production manager at—now, let me see, I'd like to get this correct—he's now the manager of the mail order section at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Oh yes, I'd heard that he was there.
And this has been a very exciting experience, because if you read the recent article on the Museum in the New York Times magazine section,
* New England Female Medical College﻿12
SWJ:	(cont.) you will see that this shop has been so successful, that the
income of it has risen so high, that now it is a significant part of the budget of the Museum. And of course, the basic theory of it is that it is a way of extending art and lovely things to the people who are far from the normal reach of the Museum.
MT:

MT:
SWJ:
MT:
SWJ;

SWJ;
MT;
And because it's successful he must enjoy it?
SWJ:	Yes, tremendously. Mr. Hoving, who is now leaving the Museum, but who has
been there as director for the last few years, said to him recently that Paul had realized one of his dreams, because he thought that in the promotion of the shop, they had extended the Museum. You know they've had a fabulous year this year with the Egyptian exhibit, and with the things that have been reproduced from this exhibit.
MT:	And sold.
SWJ: And sold, that's it. Yes. So that the income makes quite a contribution to the total budget of the Museum. He lives in Long Island, and if you've ever heard about the Long Island Railroad, you know that there are great difficulties in getting in and out of New York at certain seasons of the year. Nevertheless, it's been nice to live in a little village, and he has participated in the life of the village. He was chairman for the charity drives and ran one year for the school board, but didn't make it. He has three children, and this has been a nice place to bring up a family.
^T:	Do you know the name of the village?
SWJ:	Port Washington.
Oh, Port Washington, it's interesting.
SWJ:	You know, that's near Manhasset, that part of the island. Now the
younger boy followed the older brother and went to Phillips Academy.
About what age was he when he went, what year in grade school? He had not graduated from high school. He went there for prep school? Yes, that's right.
Yes, because he was on the Bennett campus when I was here.
Yes, that is right. I understand somebody nicknamed him "excess baggage" before he was born. This is the story that came to me from the faculty years afterwards...
I have something to add when you get to his business administration.﻿13
Ml:
SWJ:	He attended Harvard College. I don't think I can evaluate his
study habits, and I can't remember about his marks, his grades, but I know one of the most important things in his life and his activities at this time was, he became manager of the Harvard football team.
MT:	Yes, and the first time in history that it had happened. Now, 1
wanted to ask you this. He did his undergraduate work at Harvard, and then he went on in business administration?
SWJ:	That's right. He went to the war in between times. See, after he
graduated...All three of my boys enlisted. I think we can talk a long time about the war, and the effect on young men, and I think they felt that they'd rather go and enlist and get through with it, get it behind them. Now the older boy had a very difficult war experience because he made the Anzio beachhead, and this was a very dangerous part of the war. He would never talk about his experiences. Frank, when the war was over, was sent to Germany. He really had very interesting experiences and you will maybe be surprised by this, but he told mo that some of the best teaching he'd ever had in his life he'd had in the army. He went to language school in an area of the Black Forest; he spent a good bit of time in Stuttgart. He used his leave to see the other areas of Europe. When he returned, he entered the Harvard Business School and graduated from there. He married while he was in Business school, and one of the griefs of my life has been that he and his wife are separated. They ha^ two children, two fine boys I think the boys are doing well, because the parents have tried to be very careful of their welfare, but this is one of the things that has happened...
MT:	And it happens so often in this period; it isn't unique in that particular
case Of course I knew both; I saw both of them sort of in their growing up period. I was at the wedding ceremony, you were there too, and for the reception, and they were both the youngest in two distinguished families, and that may be a problem.
SWJ:	Yes well, you know he asked me one day if I felt the babies in families
should not be studied, [laughter] that maybe there were certain things that happened to them because of their positions in the families.
MT:	Well, you know, state the name and the background of his bride, of his
wife.
SWJ:	Well his wife was the youngest child of Dr. and Mrs. Mordecai W. Johnson
of Howard University. And she had gone to school at Northfield*and was a Wellesley graduate.
She was the only one of the Mordecai Johnson children permitted to go away for university work. Just like you stated, President Jones felt that Bennett should be able to educate his daughter, otherwise he wouldn t be president of a school educating other people's daughters, so Frances stayed here. But President Johnson had insisted that the others get their education at Howard. But you know she was his darling, and the
baby..
* Northfield School for Girls﻿14
SWJ:	Yes.
MT:	And they broke the rule for her. I saw them recently and your two
grandsons, at Mordecai Johnson's funeral. That was over a year ago now, and the mark of both...Mordecai Johnson put a mark on every one of his grandchildren, but there was some David Jones there too. [laughter] The minute I saw them, I knew that was a combination of the Johnsons and the Joneses, handsome youngsters they are.
SWJ:	They're lovely boys.
MT:	Yes, what is Frankie doing now?
SWJ:	Frank is at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he has a
professorship and has a chair. I've forgotten the name of the chair, I think it's...maybe I can find it. I'd rather be explicit about it, and you know, I didn't say in regard to Frances, that she has had a connection with Harvard Medical School for twenty-five years, and they have a custom there that they present to anybody who has served for that long, a Harvard chair, so she had received her Harvard chair. And you understand that her work in connection with the Medical College has been in the area of psychiatry. She has supervised the students who are in that area, and she is now training analysts, and of course has worked for a good number of years at the Boston Psychoanalytic Institute, and is now with the Psychoanalytic Institute of New England,
East.
MT:	She was at Radcliffe in some capacity. Was she a physician or there in
psychiatry?
SWJ:	You know, she received the Helen Putnam award, and I think this is a
Radcliffe award. I can't remember all of the details of that now, but it was given a good bit of publicity, and I'm sure in the Boston area it was a very important achievement.
MT:	Now, I remember when I was here on the campus, which was in the early
thirties, you may not recall it, but I think Frank, we called him Frankie of course, I think Frankie's first business was what? He managed the New York Times sales for my class in current events. The textbook was the Sunday New York Times.
SWJ:	Aunt Merze's New York Times.
MT:	That was twenty-five cents a copy. That was a lot of money to have
to spend at that time.
SWJ:	And to think what we pay for the paper now! Seventy-five cents.
MT:	But there are some of my students who say that they can't let Sunday
go by without it.
SWJ:	Without getting a copy of the New York Sunday Times.﻿15
MT:	For all that was in it. And he sold the papers on the campus, and
do you know, at that period we had the largest per capita circulation of the New York Times of any American college?
SWJ:	i'm sure this is right,and he sold them.
MT:	Yes.
SWJ:	And you know...
I wondered if he got a Social Security card from the New York Times. I got my first number from the New York Times.
SWJ:	Is that so?
Of course I wasn't under Social Security, but my number was given me then. SWJ:	At that time.
And that's the number I have today.
SWJ;
MT:
SWJ;
MT: SWJ;
MT: SWj:
Well, I think he must have picked his number up in later years, [laughter] But one of the wonderful things about living on a campus like this, with children, was that all of the children did something to help build the college. The boys all worked. Another thing Frankie used to do was to go down and get the mail; we'd send down to the post office for the mail in the morning. The boys learned to paint, make modest repairs, take care of the yard, et cetera.
I remember that Frank was in some junior orchestra or band, and when we had the mock election, and the campaigning for it, we had the band there. He was much younger than the students who were giving the campaign speeches, but he was so excited over it, and applauded it; he was part of that, as if he understood all the issues.
One of the priceless things that happened to me at the time of David's death, was I heard from so many of the Bennett girls who had been on the campus at the time he had grown up. They wrote me such warm, understanding letters. The whole family, the campus, I mean the student body, was small and the whole family participated and the boys thought that they played very important parts, [laughter]
Even though it was a women's college!
Even though it was a women's college campus, because they would either be cutting the grass back from the walks, painting our...doing something that was building to the college.
And of course the students knew them.
All the students knew them, and these letters that I received at the time of David's death were such a testimony....﻿16
I think that, Mrs. Jones, we were just on the point of mentioning the significance of rearing children, not all the time on the campus, but near it and the participation there, and your participation in the life of that college.
You know, I often said to my friends, that the Russians had a five-year plan, but I had a twenty-year plan, because this is what trying to get my kiddies up meant to me. So here while we are talking about them, up to this point, I would like to say a deep word of gratitude for the opportunities that were ours on the college campus. Not only was there the opportunity for the children to participate in the building of a college...We used to have a family story. David said to his father one night at the dinner table, "Daddy, is Bennett College as large as Howard University?" Then his Daddy said, "Oh no, son." And then he said, "Daddy, is it as large as Shaw Universitv?" And Daddy said, "Oh no, son." And he said, "Well Daddy,do you know any college that is smaller than Bennett is?" And my daughter said to him, "David, just give us a chance." Now this worked out in the years as to the fact that all of the children entered into the building of Bennett College. There were chores to be done, the grass was to be weeded, and the trips to the post office and banks were made daily. This was a priceless heritage. They learned to work and they knew when work was well done.
There was a far greater blessing that came to them and came to me as their mother. We were starting a new enterprise and there were people who were willing to help; there were people interested in the enterprise; and so in and out of the home there were visitors who greatly enriched all of our lives. We were backed by two strong institutions of the Methodist church, the Women's Home Missionary Society and the Board of Education. And there were the church officials. And then there were people who heard about the college. Mr. Jones went up and down the country telling the story of the college, and he tried to interest college people who would counsel with him. So there were people like Dr. W. W. Charters, Dr. Thomas F. Holgate, Dr. Constance Warren, who visited the college. There were people from foreign countries who came, and there were people from our group who had achieved, and whose names the children knew, but as they visited the college and spoke at the college vespers, the children had a chance to know them.
I can remember one Sunday evening, Frank, the youngest boy, was with us as we were taking Mrs. Mary McLeod Bethune to the station. And he said in the car going down, "Daddy, you know this is the first time I ever heard a speech where I understood all the speaker said." And Mrs. Bethune laughed in her characteristic way and said, "Well, Dave, I really put the cookies on the lower shelf today, didn't I?"
Then, in addition to that, one of the criticisms that Mr. Jones used to get very often, was that he had such a faculty turnover. But he had a philosophy. The college had very limited funds, and was just starting, and he thought that the best use of those funds was to keep a small nucleus of people who would be prepared to continue the ongoing﻿17
SWJ:	(cont.) of the college, but that as far as the teaching faculty
was concerned, it was better to have bright young people who would come in and stay with us for a couple of years, than it was to have older teachers who had really passed the peak of their experience as teachers. So we always felt we owed a great deal to these young people. One day the Afro-American used a picture of the quadrangle on the campus• And at the head of the picture they had, "Did you ever see a dream walking?" We thought this was largely due to the sparkle, to the enthusiasm of these young teachers.
And lately I was talking to my daughter, and after over twenty-five years in the practice of medicine, she said to me, "I have always been appreciative of the foundation that I received at Bennett College. It has stood me well in all of my endeavors." And so you see, there were people like Dr. R. Nathaniel Dett who, when she couldn't sing but wanted to be in the choir, she asked him what did you have to do, what were his criteria for taking people in the choir, he said, "Oh, many things." And she said, "Well, I don't have much of a voice." But he said, "You try out because I take them for many different reasons. Sometimes for their abili ty to sing, but sometimes just for their pulchritude."
And then there were people like Dr. Flemmie Kittrell, Dr. Merze Tate, Dr. Willa B. Player, young women who served as constant reminders to the students of what they could attain in their own lives. It's always dangerous to name names, but I feel that these people that I have named, should be named, because while there were a number of men who made valuable contributions on the faculty, these represented the plus, because the girls could see in the lives of these people what they could attain. And when the Afro-Ame rican said, "Did you ever see a dream walking?" the girls had these dreams in reality on the campus constantly, stimulating them, encouraging them and urging them to move forward. There are three names I'd like to add to that list, that is Belle Tobias, Velma Bell Hamilton, and Dr. Carol Cotton.

I agree with you. I know all of them. Well, I think that finished that up...
...for now, your statement about the influence of the college. Yes, now how does that seem to you now? I could enlarge on that. That's excellent.
But you know, I don't think you can put down everything.
No, and then there are other things later that you will think of that you will perhaps wish that you had included.
Now I tell you, you see, you said you'd like supplementary material. Life for me has been very busy; I'm sure often with no priorities. One﻿18
SWJ:	(cont.) day when I went home to visit my family, my father said to
me, "I am thinking about a new quotation I read, 'Don't do today what you can do tomorrow, you might not have to do it."' And I said, "Papa, you should be ashamed of yourself, because you raised us to worship the god of duty, and here you are saying don't get up with a heart for any fate, and saying put it off till tomorrow."
Mr. Jones's illness in the 1950s stopped all of my outside activities. At his death, the trustees were kind enough to elect me vice-president of the college. I felt that I should not accept this. I wanted to be sure not to presume on the college in any way, and whatever I did, I wanted people to understand that it would be something that was important to the ongoing of the college. And so I asked that instead of being elected vice-president, I should be elected registrar, work which I had done voluntarily in the early days of the college, and an office where I had started the college records. And so I worked in this office until I was seventy-two years of age.
Greensboro is a small town, and I have been very deeply grateful to have built a few understanding friends through the years. My oldest son died in 1976; for me, he was a great support. I never had to explain to him, or to justify any of my activities. Different from all of the other children, he always called me "Mother." My youngest son calls me "Mom," but my daughter and the second son and some of the grandchildren horrify my friends, they all call me just by my first name, Susie. David, Jr.'s, death was a shattering experience and I have not been able to adjust yet to this. Yesterday opened doors, and for the first time I looked at my life as a whole. Frances Williams's, my sister's remark when David, Sr., died was, "Just make up your mind that from now on up you've got to go it alone, and don't fool yourself, your days can never be what they have been." And then she added, "Be slow to make decisions, because I will tell you, you really have not known what you really wanted to do for the last twenty years, and it'll take you some time before you can really reach a decision."
(Dr. Tate has been so patient and encouraging. This morning I awoke with what I should have remembered in my mind. She is giving me another opportunity and so I want to go back and pick up some of my omissions.)
My father was a great teacher. He believed clearly in certain principles. One of the marked ones of these was thrift and he thought our group would never make the kind of progress they should make until they were adequate economically. And so one of his first activities in the Saint Louis community was to organize the New Age Building and Loan Association. Another thing he deplored was the housing of Negroes in the Saint Louis community. Those of you who know Saint Louis, know that there were many very large houses there, and Saint Louis was something like Brooklyn, in that these houses were grouped around and they were known, for instance, as Portland Place. As people moved to the west, and Negroes went into﻿19
(cont.) these large houses, the only way they could sustain themselves was to sublet. There was no possible way for them to keep up these mansions. And so there was a feeling in Saint Louis that property would go down when Negroes moved into the area. And my father was greatly concerned about this. We had all at this time graduated from college, and out of his earnings, which you must understand in no way compared with salaries that people earn today, he had saved enough money to build an apartment building for Negroes. This building was built by one of the leading construction firms of Saint Louis, and the building was very adequate, very impressive looking outside. And so there happened one of these strange phenomena of how people that you're trying to help turn on you, and my father faced a severe school fight.
He was the only Negro principal of a high school in Saint Louis for years. Interestingly enough, a friend, who came by one day as he sat on his porch, later said to him, since there was his own home, the apartment next door, and a housing unit next, "Mr. Williams, this is your trouble, you are looking too prosperous." But he did live to see all the leaders in the school fight come to him for some favor. I can well remember one time being there when a teacher came to him with his monthly check, and I said to my father, "What does this mean? He said, naming the teacher, "He does not seem to be able to handle his finances, and the Board of Education is continuing his employment, if he will come to me every month with his check and we will sit down and make a budget and he will keep out of the hand of vendors and people accusing him of not paying his bills."
We saw him take demotions and new assignments. He had made Sumner High School, one of the first high schools in the country, and he was moved to a downtown high school that had a very bad image, the Vashon High School. It was located in the inner city, and the majority of the students came from deprived homes. One of the first things he did, which to me was fascinating, he sat on a stool in the hall, and as the children came into the building, he would say. "Good morning" to each of them. One day a group of girls came to him and reported that the streetcar conductors were very rude to them and very unkind in their remarks, and he said, "Now when you get on the streetcars, say 'transfer please' and then after a week or ten days, come back and let me know how the situation is." The students solved their own problem.
Another favorite story from his experience, to me because I was a mother and this was a transition period in the young people's development... He told the story about two mothers; one mother who said, "I love my daughter so much, I cannot let her go to the dance;" and then the second mother said, "I love my daughter so much I have to let her go to the dance;" and then he would ask which mother loved her daught er the more. My youngest sister, who was a Phi Beta Kappa from Mount Holyoke, told me once that Papa had taught her John Dewey's philosophy of education and other concepts, so at Holyoke her learning was already started.
In the supplementary material we have included the statement that was printed in the Berea Bulletin at his death- Dr. and Mrs. Hutchins, Sr.,﻿20
SWJ:	(cont.) moved to Saint Louis to direct the Danforth Foundation.
I remember the occasion when on a visit there, he wished me to invite them to dinner. It was one of those rare evenings, but I must add, though my mother enjoyed the Hutchinses, she never gave Berea pardon for their policies regarding Negro students. She refused to make any donation and as we girls, my brother died early, grew up, we decided because of Mama's independence over a long marriage with violent disagreements, she had through the years really entertained my father... She had been the favorite in her own home and family; she had received a college education, which was rare for a woman at that time; she had made a brilliant record, and she would stand no interference with her plans. It was she who decided that Frances must go to Holyoke. They had not enrolled a colored student at Holyoke for years and when she applied for admission, they wrote her that Frances would probably be happier in an environment where she was more at home, and she answered, "Frances's happiness is none of your business; that's my business. I want to know if you will admit her." At seventy, she resigned all the clubs she had belonged to, became a member of the recently organized League of Women Voters, worked with Mrs. Gellhorn; she became a member of the college women's club*and at her death we found that she had adopted a child under CARE.
My sister Frances, after her work with the national board of the YWCA, became a member of the OPA staff under Miss Harriet Eliot of North Carolina, and later joined Senator Lehman's office as a legislative assistant. She shared fully with me and my family the richness of her wider life. There was not only an opportunity to meet her friends, which meant acquaintance with the buildings at the capital, and the dining room in the Senate Office Building, but she shared with me her love for this city, and I can remember one evening we took a taxi and went to see the Lincoln monument at nighttime with the moon shining through.
Her lasting contribution was to my children. Because she was the youngest in her family, her nickname was "Sweets," so my children called her Miss Williams or "Sweet Baby." They stopped by Washington on their trips back and forth to school, and were always welcome. David, the oldest boy, was something to reckon with, but she never complained. There was work to do. He would come with his clothes all dirty, and then his lady friends would begin to call on him.. And he would tell them that he would be so happy to do whatever their requests were, but his Aunt Frances was insistent on him working, and so he was cleaning the apartment, when in reality he was spread out on the floor listening to some opera or symphony that he was interested in. And she had patience, she would deal with all of this, with the hope that eventually he would arise and get himself together. Frances, when it came to her marriage...
This is your daughter, Frances.
SWj:	Yes, my daughter, when it came to her marriage, had graduated from medical
school. Her husband had one more year, and I felt that maybe the wedding should be postponed. How glad I have been through the years that

(cont.) why we could go down to the Carolina theater and go up to the balcony and not go to the movie on Market Street. There was a very gracious boy that helped us, and when he would ride with George, he would say to him, "George, go right ahead and hit the 'necks'". And I was very concerned about this. So when David graduated from Wesleyan, we thought this would be a good opportunity for Frank to see an interracial situation. He went to the commencement with his father, and I can remember how he came running in the house when he returned,to say, "Mama, I found out that colored boys and white boys can play together."
I didn't mention the activities that the children had been interested in, in their mature life. David, Jr., served on the Wesleyan board of trustees. Frances has worked on the issue of race among psychiatrists; she served as chairman of a committee that met in France in recent years; this past year she has written her ideas and presented them to a group of analysts that she belongs to. We spoke of Paul's interest in community activities sometime ago. Frank has membership on the Polaroid board and the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company; he was alumni trustee at Andover for a number of years, and served on the committee that merged Andover with Abbott, and lately has become a member of the Holyoke trustee board.
I owe much to the church. I was a member of the women's group in the Methodist Episcopal church at the time of unification with the southern church. I can so well remember the churches in our own community that belonged to the Southern Methodist church, and their relation to my activities. At one time I spoke at a church in the county and at the close of the evening, a dear little old lady came up and said to me, "Why were the pictures of your college in our World Outlook?" The World Outlook was the women's publication of the Methodist church South.
Another time I was invited, because I had written the study book, to speak at a church in the mill district of Greensboro. Now, the Methodist women, I considered, was the largest group in adult education in our country. The study courses were carefully prepared and great preparation was given to this educational endeavor. I was invited in the summer to conduct a summer course. When an invitation is given early, you accept and then think that the time is never going to come around. When I realized that the date was near, I had forgotten the name of the church. I had been dealing on the national level with very cultivated women.
I can so well remember one of the people, whose friendship I cherished through the years, who was a planter's wife from Mississippi, solved racial problems by her regard for good manners. She just felt that if you would follow certain etiquette, you could get along with any racial problem. She was a president of the southeastern jurisdiction of the Methodist women, and she said to them one day, "You cannot accept another invitation from the Negro women at Gulfside, until you invite them to Junaluska." The racial problems were just that simple to her.﻿23
SWJ:	(cont.) But I had never spoken to a group of white women in the
South that were considered middle-class, or lower income people. I knew that this church was in the mill district; they had made the engagement over the telephone, and I had completely forgotten where it was, so I looked up all the Methodist churches in the mill district and began to call them. I would say to them, "Are the women in your church meeting tonight for their study course?" On the third or fourth call, I got this answer, "Yes, they're meeting tonight, and a very nice colored lady is going to come to speak." When I went to the meeting, here were all of the church fathers sitting in the back row and they stayed there throughout the meeting. The women had been so educated in their approaches to racial problems, how to treat people of minorities, that it turned out to be one of my most delightful memories. And at the close of the study course, we had a party and they gave me a present to bring home. Only someone who had shared this kind of experience can fully understand the deep satisfaction of helping to push toward a better day.
The first national meeting of the women of the Methodist church was open for a wide discussion, because the president was from Saint Louis. It was a great achievement for her to be president of this new organization, and she was very anxious that the meeting should be held in Saint Louis. The group talked a great deal about the Harvard Plan of housing; well, I didn't quite understand what the Harvard Plan provided, but I found out that the Harvard Plan meant that every delegate was responsible for their own housing. I talked over this deep concern with Mrs. Worrell at the suggestion of my sister-in-law, Mrs. Robert E. Jones, who was at that time secretary of the United Council of Church Women. She suggested that I come to Columbus. She felt that the hotels in Columbus could be open. I did not need to go to any of the hotels, because when I arrived in Columbus, Mrs. Worrell had cleared the whole matter, the whole city of Columbus would be open to all delegates.
And so at our next meeting of the group, I had in my hands an invitation from the mayor of Columbus to the group to meet there. I am going into detail on this because I thought it was such a creative solution. In the packet that the Columbus women gave to each delegate when they came, there was this announcement about the restaurants in the area all being open, the hotel facilities that would be open, but each delegate was invited to take a member of a minority group with her for lunch or dinner. In other words, the responsibility for the success of the project was divided between the local community and the delegates themselves. The women in the Methodist church knew that this was a challenge to them. The invitation was accepted, and also the general conference of the Methodist church met there the next year because they too were looking for facilities without discrimination.
And what years were these?
SWJ:	x would like to be explicit about this, and I'm afraid I would have to
look that up.
MT'-	Would it be in the fifties or sixties?﻿24
SWJ:	oh no, it would be in the fifties.
MT:	Well, that's all right.
SWJ:	I was also a representative from the United Council of Church Women in
the organization of the National Council of Churches. I had had charge of the devotions one morning, and at the close of the session, a little woman came up to me and said, "Mrs. Jones, I am Mrs. Garen from Greensboro, North Carolina. We have got to go back to Greensboro and do something." The Council of Church Women had been organized in Greensboro for some time, but they had no Negro members. Although there were former YWCA secretaries who felt that this was a great burden, to get church women together, Mrs. Garen, because of her earnestness and her zeal, simply came back to Greensboro and without any ado integrated the church women of Greensboro.
The highlight of my experience with the Council of Church Women was to be named as one of two women to go to Zurich, Switzerland, and meet, and this was the first meeting of Protestant women after the war, for the 75th anniversary World Day of Prayer. I can never tell you what this experience meant. There were women from all of the European countries; there was a mayor's wife from Holland; there was a dear woman from Belgium, who all of their family's money was invested in the Congo and this was at the time of the insurrection, unrest in the Congo and the changes there; there was a member of the Salvation Army from England; and then there were, of course, women from Switzerland, and an African woman from the Cameroons who knew nothing but French, and I knew nothing but English, and all we could do was just to pat each other on the shoulders as we would pass.
Now at this period, you may know, Mr. Jones's brother was a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal church and this was an active part of his ministry, and so I want to say that I am quite sure that part of my opportunities stemmed from his leadership.
I am deeply grateful to the Radcliffe committee who have given me this opportunity to gather myself together. Howard Thurman talks about the therapy of memory. My days with Dr. Tate have been truly an adventure into the past, and I could not have done this without her constant patience and encouragement, not in what she said, but by the expressions on her face that made me feel that what I was saying must go on. I live in a small town with all its assets and liabilities. Of course the town has changed, and I have changed. I can remember my early irritations when people would call up and say, "I heard you were at the movies last night." And this used to just rile me more than I can tell. At this age, however, I am so grateful for its warmth and concern and caring, and if they didn't call up to say they'd heard I was at the movies, I would feel very lost. Dr. Tate has encouraged me to talk about this. I never dreamed I could, but at this time, I have been greatly blessed to have gathered together my whole life. I cannot express adequately my gratitute to her and the committee.﻿25
MT:	Nor can we express to you our deep gratitude for revealing so many
facts that we would never have known. Even with the five years that I spent here on the campus, and the years afterwards when I ve known you and your family, been intimately associated in some way with events, like the marriage of Frank [M.T. made movies of the occasion], that we would have had the opportunity of gathering this information and having it for all time on record, amazes me. And you remember the tapes will be sent you and there will also be the opportunity for you to have the transcript. Any changes that you wish to make or any additions, to add to this, I will come, I will come to you for anything you wish to record or if you are in Washington, we can make additions. This is not necessarily the final work. Now I would say, thank you, Mrs. Jones.
SWJ:	Thank you very much.
MT:	It has indeed been a pleasure for me to spend these two days in your
home and for us to decide what you would like to record and then to have recorded it. You mentioned the visit to Zurich. I noted from some pictures that you have brought out, that you and your husband must have made a transatlantic crossing on the Cunard line, and I would
like to know when.
SWJ-	yes we made three, rather two, trips to Europe together. The first
one'was to a meetiAg of the World Methodist Federation. The second Ze our youngest boy was stationed in Stuttgart and we went over to Le him; and then the trip to Zurich J made alone, this was after Mr Jones's death. So we made those trips; we didn't have extensive travel but we did see the western part of the country, and I am sure that vou agree that you really haven't seen this country until you've sien the West! And then I have been to Mexico, which I found just so enchanting, and the Caribbean.
Ml:	Which islands did you visit in the Caribbean? Was it a cruise, or...?
SWJ-	It was a cruise. This was after Mr. Jones's death; I went with two
friends from here, and it was a two-week cruise, so we saw a great many of the islands. Cuba was closed; Haiti was m trouble, and...
MT:	And the ship was your hotel?
SWJ-	Yes the ship was a hotel, we had quite an experience. The YWCA, you
J'	n verv eager to furnish foster parents for the foreign
Sud^: in the county. So I was a foster parent for a little girl students in tn	,	parents would come to the boat, I
from St. Thomas. I tola ne	f	^ anxious to see
would go and vxsx wx * ^m an^lv ^ ^	^ ^ ^ ^ of
th^6science department in the high school. And so before the ship
hardly came Into port, there was a knock on our door and here was my
)ZtJr eirl's father. I talked to my friends, and we agreed that two
o'clock ioJld be a good hour for him to pick us up. But when two o'clock
came my friends announced that they were going shopping, and so I had came, my rrxe	^ ^ vehicle> here was an army
°eep° painted pink'a^d green. Mother was sitting in a chair in the back of t^e Jeep, Auntie was sitting in a rocking chair, and I was to sit on
the seat with the driver...﻿26
MT:	That's first class outside this country. If you have the seat with
the driver in India, Ceylon, Burma, et cetera, you are riding first class.
SWJ:	Well, I want to tell you how precarious my ride was. St. Thomas is
fascinating, because here you can see the coves where the pirates used to hide. There is a legend if you go to the Mountaintop Hotel and drink a banana daquiri, you will come back to St. Thomas, and so after seeing the shore line we went to the Mountaintop Hotel. When we arrived everyone got out, including Auntie, and we went into this very swank hotel, sat at the bar and the father ordered two banana daquiris. I was uncomfortable, because I didn't know what to do. Finally mother leaned over and said, "Auntie and I do not care for any." Well, if the truth were to be told, I didn't care for any either, but I knew that I must manage this banana daquiri. When we returned to the jeep with nothing to hold on to except the side of the seat, and he took the curves very fast, I thought I really am going to be disgraced. I'm going to be thrown off of this jeeij>, and my friends are all going to say it was because of that banana daquiri. We arrived at the ship safe and sound, and I told my friends they'd missed the opportunity of their lives, because they would have never gotten through talking about this jeep, if they had just had a sight of it.
MT:	You mentioned the trip that you took to western Europe with President
Jones.
SWJ:	Yes.
MT:	Did you get to England, and then on the Continent, or was it mostly...
SWJ:	We spent a great deal of time in England. This was right after the war,
but we had been on the Continent beforehand, and all of the people that we had met, tourists, had complained about the food, how terrible the food was in England. And Mr. Jones said to me, "Now when we get to England, let's not make an issue of the food; no matter what it is, just let's not talk about it." Well, to me it was really a sad experience. I was one morning in a cafeteria getting a cup of coffee, and I wore a woolen suit that had a double row of buttons down the front. A lady came over and sat down at my table and said, "You know, I've been looking at the buttons on your suit, there's such things as that we have been so deprived of these years." And then I went to the markets and I saw how the women were examing everything they bought. Really, I felt that the American group was a little lacking in sensitivity to have come over there with their furs and their elaborate clothes, to a country that had been so impoverished by the war. I was not too well at the end of the trip, and when we arrived in Plymouth, where we -were going to take the boat, I said to Mr. Jones, if I could just have a soft-boiled egg, that's all I would want to eat. He went to the dining room and the steward told him there wasn't an egg in Plymouth.
There were delegates on the boat from the meeting, and one of their topics of conversation was the fact that they had not been invited into the homes of the British delegates, and that they wondered about their hospitality. I was so new in this kind of experience that I just didn't﻿27
SWJ:	(cont.) express any feeling, but I felt from my own experience
that they just didn't understand what the havocs of war had brought to Great Britain. To me it was a wonderful experience because one of the buildings we met in was at Oxford. It had been built by the great architect Christopher Wren. And we walked about those campuses, you know, where an American asked, "How long did it take you to get a lawn like this?" and the caretaker said, "Three hundred years. We had this kind of opportunity. I remember one evening, at the sessions, we spent singing the Wesley hymns and what a privilege this was But there were all the evidences there, because where the bombs had landed in London, the debris hadn't yet been cleared away, and there were all the evidences of the war.
The second time we went, the trip was quite different. Frank was in the army He had bought an army jeep, and he met us in Paris with this jeep, and we went through the area, the farming area of France and
Belgium and Holland...
MT:	In the jeep?
SWJ:	In the jeep.
MT:	A wonderful experience.
SWJ:	Down to Stuttgart and then spent a week or ten days there with him.
Now, of course, you know I don't understand the army and the men in the fiehting forces were out on maneuvers, and word had gotten around that the men in the offices were visiting the homes of the men who were out on maneuvers. And so the command of the day was that all of the men were to stay in camp in their fatigues, they weren t to go out But we couldn't get a taxi; we had a plane to make and Frank said «Wt worry I'll get you out," and so he brought his jeep around, and I Zl could ™t understand it, but he gave the man at the gate the V sign and he got us to the airport. But you can imagine my anxiety. I was so reLved when he called up to see if we'd gotten to our next destination, which was Geneva in Switzerland, and I found out that he hadn t gotten into any trouble. It was a great privilege to have had this time m that area. The third time I went alone, and this was consternation to many
of my friends.
MT:	To think that you would travel alone?
SWJ-	Yes with no party. But I was booked through American Express, and this
meant that I was met at every place, and transportation was arranged to get me to the next place. I visited new places; I spent tme in Venice. ! must have spent over a week in Florence, and then I went to Rome,
have spent two weeks there. I was at a very modest hotel, but it was weU located. I could walk one way to the Spanish Steps and I could walk another way to the Colisseum. This was a rare privilege. I would lo to the museums in the morning and then come home and rest, orTd rest in the morning and go in the afternoon. I had no unpleasant experiences. One night I was awakened by somebody banging on my door, but siranje to say, it didn't frighten me. I looked up and saw the﻿28
SWJ:	(cont.) chain was on the door, so I just called the desk and told
them that somebody must have lost their way. They called me back to say that this was exactly what had happened. My trip was in off-season and when you travel abroad in off-season, you meet up with the same people over and over again. When I arrived at a new place, I planned to take the American Express tour. Then I would go back and spend time at any place I wished to see again.
I met a mother and her son from New Zealand, Christchurch; they were making a trip around the world. They had been to the Far East, and India. I met them in Italy. We went together to Capri and I was very interested and I'll come back to this, but at any rate, this was a wonderful contact. They were lovely people. I invited them to spend Thanksgiving with me in the United States. Now one thing I didn't know, because I am not knowledgeable in this area, many of our race horses are bred in New Zealand. They knew certain places like Pimlico, and the racetracks—the Louisville, Kentucky Derby. They wanted to see those places, but they didn't know much about America otherwise. One very hot day in August, I received a telephone call. They had cut their trip short because the mother was not feeling well and they were in Washington. They wondered if it would be convenient for them to come to North Carolina. We had a delightful visit. New Zealand has a self-contained economy, so they were excited over two things: the amount of cotton goods we had on sale, that they were able to buy in retail stores, and the large American car. I took them down to see a used car sale lot.
MT:
SWj:
In the meantime... do you remember... in the meantime, I'd like to remind you of a very beautiful thing that you and President Jones did when the principal of my college at Oxford was in this country. She was at Chapel Hill, but she had written me in advance to say that she would be in North Carolina, and asked if Chapel Hill was far from Greensboro. The long and short of it was that President Jones arranged to send your car with the driver, and I went along, to Chapel Hill. We picked up Miss Grace Hadow, brought her here to your home, and around this dining table you had prepared and served beautifully a typical American menu, with things that perhaps she wouldn't know about in England, even down to the strawberry shortcake that was not made from cake but from the biscuit dough, and explained that to her. Then she had to go to Charlotte and I believe you sent her to Charlotte in the car, and from there she continued her journey southward. And she often wrote about the experience here in your home. And then there was a chapel program, I don't remember whether it was Chapel Day, but a program was arranged, and instead of prayers and reading the Bible to a large extent, or expecting Miss Hadow to speak, the choir rendered the entire service. Our Nathaniel Dett was here, and he had the choir turn and face the stage where Miss Hadow was with President Jones, and it was to me one of the great events of my period here at Bennett.
This is what I was trying to say, when I said how living on the campus had enriched the life of my family and the lives of the children. Returning to the children, I told you at one time that my oldest boy had﻿29
SWJ:	(cont.) made the Anzio beachhead, and of course Capri was one of the
places where the American boys were sent for rest periods. Sorrento and the Amalfi Drive are a part of this experience. X was very anxious to see these points. The world is very small. We went on a sightseeing bus, and the guide on the bus, because he knew I was from America said to me, "You know I had the rare privilege one year of serving as a guide to one of your chief justices and his little daughter." And then he said, "You know, his little daughter was so charming, I have often wondered what became of her." I asked the name of the chief justice, and he told me that it was Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes. His daughter serves on the United Negro College Fund, she is Mrs. Wadell, Mrs. Chauncy Wadell. She is very active in American life, and just as charming as an adult as she could have been as a child. I thought this was such a strange coincidence that he would have remembered this throughout the years and that I should have been privileged to know Mrs. Wadell. She and her husband had been guests here in the home.
I found Mexico very intriguing and interesting. When we first went there, we stayed with a classmate of my sister, who had a guest house. This gave us a chance to have an experience because her husband was Mexican, she had a Mexican cook, and they lived in a sort of a compound. After we had been to Taxco, and the great resort place...
MT:	There are several...near Mexico City?
SWJ:	No. On the coast.
MT:	You didn't go to Tehuantepec?
SWJ:	No, it's Acapulco. After I visited these places, Cuernavaca and Taxco,
we returned to Mexico City and were there at the Christmas season. We stayed at a very old hotel near the park. All of the Christmas observances were planned, and this was a great treat to us. We found the shops interesting, and one day we were getting out of a taxi and heard someone say, "Frances Williams, what are you doing down here?" And here was one of the young men that she had worked with in OPA. He was living in Mexico City. At this time, the country had a rule that no foreigner could go into business alone. His business was making slacks—a Jewish boy from Philadelphia. His home was just, well, beautiful, peaceful and all in good taste—just a pleasaure to wander around in. He had invited the American consul and his wife to dinner also. They lingered after dinner, and for a short time we were alone. His first remark was, "I think this is characteristic of a good bit of foreign travel. People never leave home, they still do the same things they did in the United States." And then he explained to us that the mark of a good cook in Mexico is that she knovs how to make soup. "You know," he said, "I feel sorry for them, but there's nothing you can do for they never really leave America."
I spent time in the park because the hotel was close. The thing that impressed me was the kindness and tenderness of the treatment of little children. I have been in American department stores where parents jerked their children or smacked their children and I never saw this in Mexico﻿30
SWJ:	(cont.) City. The children were not disorderly, but they were
not suppressed. Now don't you think we should stop?
MT:	Not exactly, but we can pause... Mrs. Jones, I understand that you
have certain pictures that you are willing to turn over to the Project for Black Women for Oral History. The librarian will be very happy to have these, but you understand if you wish any of them returned, they can be duplicated. Now this is beautiful, a spendid picture of the subject of this recording. I'm delighted that you have an extra one to provide for us. This is a picture of you taken about when?
SWJ:	1940.
MT:	And it was while you were here, obviously, on the campus.
SWJ:	Oh yes, that's right. We came in 1926.
MT:	Now I know they'll be very happy to have some pictures of your
forebears. And this is the picture of whom?
SWJ:	My great-grandmother.
MT:	And this picture?
SWJ:	My mother.
MT:	Oh, how fortunate we are. Now these are dear little girls.
SWJ:	Those are my family when we were all young, my two sisters and my
brother, and you can notice they are very dated. You see my brother with a black ribbon tied around his curls.
MT:	Oh, that's your brother?
SWJ:	That is my brother.
MT:	And this?
SWJ:	That's my youngest sister, Frances, with my sister, Mrs. Stamps.
MT:	Oh, they will be delighted with that portrait. And this, we are very
fortunate to have.
SWJ:	This is a picture of my husband and me on one of our trips to Europe.
MT:	Yes, I note it states, I think, the Cunard Lines arrival September 22, 1951.
That was arrival in Europe?
SWJ:	I rather think that was taken by a photographer who met us when we came back.
MT;	Oh, when you returned.﻿31
SWJ:	When we returned.
MT:	After a trip to Europe. That's after World War II.
SWJ:	This was taken, I think, around the 1950s, and it's taken in front of
the student union, which was the last building that Mr. Jones erected on the campus during his lifetime.
MT:	Oh, I.know they'll be pleased to have that particular one.
SWJ:	This is a picture of my youngest sister, Frances, who spoke at one
of our chapel occasions, taken with Mr. Jones.
MT:	Yes, and this is Frances Williams, at about the same time. Was this
during her period of assignment in Washington?
SWJ:	Yes, this was during that period.
MT:	And she was with the...
SWJ:	She was with the Office of Price Administration.
MT:	That's right, I remember her. Now...
SWJ:	This is a picture of my oldest son when he became assistant to Judge
Kross in New York. The young woman is his wife, Dr. Jane Wright, and then of course, there is Judge Kross. Whenever I would tell David about how old he was, he'd say, "You have to do better than that because Judge Anna Kross is so many years older, and she's doing so many wonderful things still."
MT:	This.' I, oh, I appreciate so much.'
SWJ:	Well, this is my daughter. She graduated from Bennett and she was married
in the chapel here.
MT:	This was some time after her graduation.
SWJ:	Oh yes, she had finished medical school when this was taken.
MT:	She looks like a movie star there.
SWJ:	Oh dear.
MT:	And I had great difficulty in trying to select either a side view or one
in full, but they're both gorgeous of her.
SWJ:	Well, she was married in the chapel, and every Christmas during our time,
the chapel was decorated with Christmas greens and candles. This was my son Paul's contribution. It was the way they decorated every year at Mount tfermon. They went out in the iroods and selected the greens. She was﻿32
SWJ:	(cont.) married in the chapel with only the solid live green background
and candles. This picture was taken in Merner Hall, where we had the reception after the ceremony. Her bridesmaids, too, wore all white, and they carried red roses, and she carried the white. The representatives of the student body helped with the reception.
I think the two most famous weddings among our group on the East coast would be this one and that of Josephine Herreld Love in the Sister's Chapel of Spellman College in Atlanta.
MT:
SWJ:
SWJ: MT:
SWJ:
MT:
They are warm friends. This is a picture of my second son, Paul, and we've talked about him. And this is Frank in his room at Harvard.
MT:	That's a study.
Yes. You know the boys had suites.
We've gone through your sons and daughter. We have some pictures here, I think you have some of your grandchildren.
These are two pictures of David, Jr.'s, older girl, one when she was quite small, and one when she was about three years old. This year you will remember, I told you she graduated from Cornell Medical School. Her mother and she has two aunts who are doctors, her grandfather was a very prominent surgeon. She is following in their footsteps.
This is my daughter, her husband and her two girls. These two girls are now married. They both graduated from [Mount] Holyoke College. This is a picture of the older girl's wedding. Both girls were married in the yard of their home, and this is a picture of the older girl's wedding Her own sister is her maid of honor, and the bridesmaids are Holyoke classmates. This is her husband, his brother and the groomsmen.
MT:	And they're from?
SWJ:
The men are largely from Tufts, because the groom and his brother both graduated from Tufts, and these are their friends.
MT:	Yes. What is he?
SWJ:
Well, he belongs to the Jewish faith, but you would not pay too much attention to that I would hope.
No but it's very interesting, and I note the nature of the other people, This bridesmaid looks as though she might be Oriental or part Asian.
SWJ:	She is.
MT:	Now these three I've kept together because they are in color and they
belong in the same family, I believe.﻿33
SWJ:	Yes, these are Paul's children. His oldest child is Martha Jones, and
she is this year, 1977, starting her second year in college. Last semester she made the dean's list and so we hope that this means that she's had a good start in college. And this is the son, Paul, Jr., and the baby, Laura Frances.
MT:	Oh yes. They're very interesting. She has almost blondish hair and light
brown-bluish eyes. What is her mother, do you have a picture of her mother?
SWJ:	There is a picture of their mother in my sitting room there, but their
mother is white American. But there too, you remember, situations have so much to deal with these kinds of things and so we just don't label them too much.
MT:	Thank you. And this last one?
SWJ:
This last one is the youngest boy's older boy.
MT:	That would be Frank's son.
SWJ:	Yes, and he is named for his grandfather, who is of course David
Dallas Jones, and his name is David Dallas Jones. He's the third one in the family to carry that name. He's here with his cousin, and you realize too, that these are also grandchildren of Dr. and Mrs. Mordecai Johnson.
MT:	Because this little girl cousin is the daughter of Carolyn, is that
not right?
SWJ:	Carolyn Graves. Her mother was the oldest of the Johnson children,
and his mother, Frank's wife, was the youngest. There were two girls and you know there are boys all in between.
MT:	Yes, now this picture was one that fell out. I guess I'm interested
because the young lady is with a horse.
SWJ:	This is my oldest son David's second daughter, and this is a current
picture. She is a student at Michigan State and is working on her doctorate. She is a great lover of animals, and Michigan State in East Lansing, as you know, is in a country setting, a small town. And so she, out of her own personal money, because she has been very fortunate in getting jobs, bought herself a horse.
MT:	But buying a horse is one thing, and then maintaining it is another.
SWJ:	She keeps it on a farm twenty miles out of Lansing, and I don't know
all the details, but this horse is very important to her way of living.﻿34
MT:	Well, that's interesting. Well, I know the coordinator of the project
and the Schlesinger Library will be very happy to have these pictures to support and supplement in many ways the tape recording, and I'm very grateful. I have enjoyed going through these, the various ones, the hundreds that you have, and the very fact that you have extras and are contributing these to the Schlesinger Library for the Black Women Oral History Project, is most fortunate for us.
SWJ:	Thank you again, Dr. Tate.
MT:	As a summary of and a conclusion to Mrs. Susie W. Jones's oral history,
I should like to read into the record the activities of a particular day, that is important in the recognition of the achievements of Mrs. David D. Jones. The Greensboro Council of Church Women United chose the occasion of its May 2, 1969, Fellowship Day in the chapel of the First Baptist Church, to honor Mrs. David D. Jones with a life membership in the state organization. Mrs. Chester Arnold, who made the presentation, notes that Mrs. Jones is the first Negro woman to receive the membership.
Born Susie Pearl Williams in Danville, Kentucky, she was the daughter of the late Frank L. Williams, for many years principal of the Sumner and Vashon High Schools in Saint Louis, Missouri, and the late Mrs. Fannie B. Williams. She came to Bennett College when her husband, Dr. David Dallas Jones, became President, and worked side by side with him to give young Negro women preparation for both career and family living. After her husband's death, continued to serve the college as director of admissions, and Bennett graduates, throughout the nation, have reason to be grateful for her warmth and inspiration. A graduate of the University of Cincinnati, she has served nationally as vice-president of the United Council of Church Women, a member of the Department of Christian Social Relations and on the Board of Missions and Church Extension of the Methodist Church, and on the executive committee of the North Carolina Federation of Negro Women's Clubs. It is perhaps as a mother of four remarkable children that she has received the greatest satisfaction. They are David Dallas, graduate of Wesleyan College and Harvard Law School, and director of the Harlem Teams for Self-Help in New York; Frances, a graduate of Bennett and Boston University Medical School, a practicing psychiatrist, married to a physician, instructor in social psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, lecturer at Simmons College, and an assistant in psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital; also Paul, educated at Mount Hermon, and production manager of graphic arts for Saint John's Associates in New York; and Frank Sidney, graduate of Phillips Andover and Harvard School of Business Administration, married to the daughter of Howard University President and director of the Urban Laboratory of Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Mrs. Jones has nine grandchildren. One of the pioneering groups that owes much to her interest is the Maude Windsor Nursery School.﻿35
(cont.) In addition, I should like to read a brief statement from the World Outlook, a monthly of the Methodist church, and this was published in May, 1962. Actually, it's by the Board of Missions of the Methodist church. There are four women featured, among them is Mrs. Jones, and this is the statement.
"Mrs. David D. Jones, a board member from 1940 to 1948. In a rare way she cut through red tape, brought new appreciation of staff to board and board to staff, and gave new perceptions of the leadership of women in the central jurisdiction. One great achievement was her insistence on a Seminar on Literature and Program with women from overseas, held just before the meeting of the World Federation of Methodist Women at Berkeley, California, in 1952. From the effect of this seminar, the World Federation began to change its character so that it was able to become the truly international organization it is today."
Such are two summaries of the work and achievements of Mrs. Jones.
For further references, I should like to insert into this tape a list of Who's Who, in which Mrs. Jones appears. I think it is interesting and unique to mention that President David D. Jones and Mrs. Jones were the first couple in Greensboro, white or black, to appear in Who's Who in America. The particular edition is that of Who's Who in America for 1950-51, with David Dallas Jones appearing on page 1414, and Mrs. Susie W. Jones (Mrs. David D. Jones) on page 1422. In Who's Who in the South and Southwest, the sixth edition, volume VI, Mrs. Susie Williams Jones (Mrs. David Dallas Jones) appears also in this. This was on her own as well as being the wife of David Dallas Jones. In Who's Who Among American Women, the first edition, 1958-59, Mrs. Jones's life and brief description appear on pages 666-67.﻿SUSIE W. JONES
