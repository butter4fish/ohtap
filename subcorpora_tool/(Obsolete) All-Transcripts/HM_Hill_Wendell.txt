Speaker 1: Alright, my name is Larry Crowe. I'm interviewer today with The HistoryMakers. Our videographer is Matthew Hickey. Sir, could you please state your full name and spell it for us, please?
Speaker 2: Yes, Wendell Talbot Hill III. The first name W-E-N-D-E-L-L, middle name is T-A-L-B-O-T, and then Hill, H-I-L-L.
Speaker 1: Alright, and, sir, what is your date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I was born in Berkley, California, and on September 21st, 1952.
Speaker 1: Alright, and, sir, what is your occupation and title?
Speaker 2: I'm a professor here at the University of Maryland and my tenure is in the Institute for Physical Science and Technology, which is an interdisciplinary institution. But I also have appointments in physics and in the Joint Quantum Institute.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what is today's date?
Speaker 2: This should be September 12, 2012.
Speaker 1: And where are we at the present time?
Speaker 2: We're at the university--on the campus of the University of Maryland.
Story_ID: 24566
Speaker 1: Okay, now, before we go into depth, there are five, sort of lightweight questions we ask as a warm up. They only require a short answer.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: The first one is, do you have--
Speaker 2: My telephone--(unclear), sorry.
Speaker 1: --a favorite, do you have a favorite food?
Speaker 2: A favorite food. Well, well, I like lots of different types of food. Being from Southern California, I, I like Mexican food. I like spicy foods. I'm not sure I have a favorite. I eat lots of fish. So I guess if you ask me favorite, it would be foods that have lots of flavor to them, interesting tastes from various parts of the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, do you have a favorite color?
Speaker 2: Blue is my favorite color.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Dodger blue.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay. Do you have a favorite time of the year?
Speaker 2: Summer.
Speaker 1: Favorite vacation destination?
Speaker 2: It depends on what you mean. If I'm going to get recalibrated, to kick back to relax, I go back to California, mostly Southern California. If, if I'm going for sightseeing to, to learn, then it can be any place in the world.
Speaker 1: Okay, the last question is do you have a favorite phrase or saying?
Speaker 2: Well, I text my daughters all the time when they're telling me they're going some place, is to "Have fun and be safe". But I, but I have lot of other things I guess. Well, I, let me stick with that one, "Have fun and be safe".
Speaker 1: Okay, alright.
Story_ID: 24567
Speaker 1: Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Yes, Marcella Elaine Washington Hill, and M-A-R-C-E-L-L-A, E-L-A-I-N-E, Washington, W-A-S-H-I-N-G-T-O-N, and Hill.
Speaker 1: Alright, and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: September 5th, 1927, and she was born in Bloomington, Illinois.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family? How far back can you trace them, and what were they doing?
Speaker 2: Well, let me go start with my mother. Again, she was born in Bloomington, Illinois. Her mother was also born in Bloomington, Illinois. And as I understand it, of course, most of us who are African American were slaves at one point in time. My understanding is my mother's mother's side of the family came up from the South, and it's not clear whether they were freed prior to that, they came up with the slave owners or just what happened. But that's how they got into Illinois. That's my understanding. And that's about as far back on her, on my mother's side that I know.
Speaker 1: Do you know where they came from?
Speaker 2: No, I don't. I do not know. Now, her father was from Alabama, and again, I'm sure of all of the origin, but I think as, as I've been told that part of his family came from the Islands. He used to tell me about his grandfather who was, was an Indian. And I believe he had, went by the name of Hoss. That's about all I know. But he used to tell me about his grandfather. And, again, that's about as far back as I can go on that side of the family.
Speaker 1: So this is an island connection you say or--
Speaker 2: That's what I've been told, but I don't know anything more than that.
Speaker 1: So they don't mention the island or whether it's Jamaica or Barbados or--
Speaker 2: No, I, I don't know anything.
Story_ID: 24568
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. Well, what did your grandparents do for a living on your mother's side?
Speaker 2: Well, my grandfather actually was, was an educator. He was the president of a small college in, in Texas, called Jarvis Christian College. It's my understanding he was the second president of that. So my mother [Marcella Elaine Washington], who has three, two siblings, spent a lot of their formative years in Texas, which is just about a hundred miles, sort of East of Dallas [Texas]. And so this, this small school is where they spent their early--my mother spent her early days, and as I said, my grandfather was the president of that school. He, he was an athlete. He used to play baseball and played basketball, used to coach basketball. He and I shared this baseball connection because that--well, we'll get into that a little later. But he was also a pastor. And so when I knew him, he was, he was a pastor. And he was pastor of a church in Berkley [California] for a number of years. And then when he went into retirement, he pastored a few churches in Los Angeles [California], sort of as interim type pastors while they were, were building. So he, that's sort of the connection that I, I guess the early connection that I had on sort of the academic side because he was very much into, into academics. My grand--
Speaker 1: Now--
Speaker 2: Excuse me.
Speaker 1: Just wanted to have, what's your grandfather's name (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Peter Clarence Washington, Sr., actually.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what denomination was it?
Speaker 2: Disciples of Christ.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright, was it Jarvis Christian School--
Speaker 2: --college, yes.
Speaker 1: --(unclear) (simultaneous) the Disciples of Christ?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah, it's--
Speaker 2: And they're stories about that as I understand it because, well, this was, I guess in the, in the '30's[1930s], I guess. And so this college was set aside for young African Americans, but then it turns out that there was oil on this, this land. And as I understand it, I obviously wasn't there, my grandfather had to fight a lot to keep that money and keep that oil on the campus and have it--so it wasn't taken away. And so the college--it still has that oil well, at least the last time I was there. And it actually allowed it to prosper.
Speaker 1: That's, that should be quite a story if all the details are known of the fight to--
Speaker 2: Yeah, I don't know. That's all I've heard, and, of course, this is all secondhand, so, you know how secondhand stories go.
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it makes sense, though, I mean, you know, just--I couldn't imagine them having oil on the land and him not having to fight with the (laughter)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, back in those days, yes.
Speaker 1: --maintain control of the school, yeah, and even now-a-days (laughter).
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, true.
Speaker 1: You know, that'd, it sounds like a struggle in the making. So, okay, so Jarvis Christian [College] still exists?
Speaker 2: Yes, it does.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so I wondered if it did. So many have come and gone. I know, I think Bishop College came and it went out and somebody bought it and opened it up.
Speaker 2: No, this is still there.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Jarvis is still there.
Speaker 2: Yeah, in fact, there's a, there's a dorm, I believe, named after my grandfather, and there's a little monument for my grandfather and my grandmother.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was your grandmother's name?
Speaker 2: Rosa Washington.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright. And so, there's a, some kind of a baseball connection that you'll talk about later, right? You were telling us.
Speaker 2: Ah, yeah, he was a baseball player. And you--I know you don't wanna jump around, but just a little vignette, and we can come in a little later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: They lived in the Bay area. I lived in Southern California, and my grandfather used to take me out to the Giant games, and we would freeze in the daytime out at Candlestick [Park]. But we used to talk about baseball a lot. So.
Speaker 1: Okay. Now, that, those were the days when Willie Mays was playing--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --Willie McCovey.
Speaker 2: McCovey, Mays, all them of Maury Wills, Sandy Koufax and Willie Davis. It's back when the rivalry between the Dodgers and Giants were pretty, pretty strong.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So, now you were gonna tell us about the other grandfather, I think.
Speaker 2: Okay, well, I was gonna tell you about my grandmother. My, my, of course, my grandmother was, was always, supported my grandfather. And, of course, she was the pastor's wife, and she was very, very personable and probably played a very key role in, in keeping my grandfather in the right direction 'cause she was the connection to people. And, not that he was aloof or anything. But she was very, very much of a social butterfly. She also worked at U-C [University of California] Berkley, part time, in the library on, on the campus, the main library there. So, again, when I used to go up to visit them when I was young, we would drive up to the campus and, and pick her up after work; don't know exactly what she did as a librarian, but that's where she was employed part time at least.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.
Story_ID: 24569
Speaker 1: Now, what did your mother [Marcella Elaine Washington] say about growing up? Now, she grew up then partly in Bloomington [Illinois] and part in--
Speaker 2: She was born in Bloomington, but basically, in her formative years were spent in Texas, there on the campus there. So she was very much, she, she has two siblings. She and her sister are very close in age, thirteen months, I believe, something like that apart. So they were very much close. They were very studious, very good students. My mother used to like to run a lot, did track. So she ran up and down the campus. They lived right there on the campus because there was a campus house for the president to live in. So she was, she was a very good student. She was a, it turned out she was a chemistry major. She went to the University of Michigan for a while, but she actually went to Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, and that was where she and my father met. They both were there, very few African Americans at that school at that time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, so your mother wanted to be a chemist? Is that--
Speaker 2: Well, she told me she was majoring in chemistry. She, she actually ended up in mathematics. So she taught for a number of years in the secondary school, Algebra, a lot. And she tells the story I used to help her grade her Algebra papers when I was, well, probably I could even talk. But that's her story. I, I did in later years, certainly helped her. And she also wrote a textbook which we helped put together, my brother and some friends and I. And so she was a math teacher, and she was, taught in, in Los Angeles [California], and, in fact, one interesting story, she taught at a school, a junior high school, John Burrows Junior High School, and Nat King Cole's daughters were there. And I, I believe one of them was, was a student of hers in her class.
Speaker 1: Natalie Cole and--
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not sure if it was her or her sister, but, again, this is from my mother's story.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't know the other's sister's name off hand.
Speaker 2: I can't help you there either.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24570
Speaker 1: Your father's [Wendell Hill Jr.] name is the same as yours, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, he's junior.
Speaker 1: Junior, okay. And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: Okay, he was born on the 16th of December, 1924, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, we're ready to go to--
Speaker 2: Okay, he grew up primarily in New Jersey though, in Palmyra [New Jersey]. He spent some time in Camden [New Jersey], but I think most of his time was in Palmyra. His father was, was senior, and he was a postal worker. I'm not exactly sure whether he was a letter carrier, which I believe that's what he was. But, and his father was from Atlantic City [New Jersey]. Now, it's my grandmother that has the history that we've traced back, all the way back to the 1700s. And Mildred was her name. And her family name was, was Bailey. And if we go back, I, I can tell you a little bit about the, the ancestry as we go back. So her parents were Dora Bailey and her father's, her father's father, I believe, was a half-brother of Frederick Douglas, who was also a Bailey.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Now, he was a half-brother because their mothers, of course, were slaves, and in those days, the slave owners had their will of whomever they wanted, and so that's how they became half-brothers. So they're both cousins--so my, my grandmother's grandfather was both a first cousin and a half-brother of Frederick Douglass. And so their mothers are known, and I have a family tree which I can show you, and then from there, it goes back one more generation to a Steven Bailey, which is as far back as we can go--as far back as I know.
Speaker 1: So the, your great grandfather, who is the half-brother of Frederick Douglass, what was his name?
Speaker 2: It would be great, great.
Speaker 1: Great, great?
Speaker 2: Because it's my grandmother's grandfather.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, alright. So his--do you know his name?
Speaker 2: I could get his name. I think it's, I believe it's also Steven, but I have to check.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright. So, and then, so now the Steven--would this be a Steven Douglass, you're talking about?
Speaker 2: No, no, no. But, actually, Douglass' name was Bailey.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's right.
Speaker 2: And his history is known as well.
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, my fault, yeah, 'cause Frederick Douglass' original name, I guess slave name was Frederick Augustus Bailey.
Speaker 2: Frederick Augustus Douglas Bailey, I believe or something like that.
Speaker 1: Yeah, he went (unclear) Douglas--
Speaker 2: We can find. That's, that's in the records.
Speaker 1: Frederick Douglass, I think it's Washington Bailey or something. But that's, okay. Alright, go ahead with Steven. That's the, is that the great grandfather?
Speaker 2: That would be my great, that was my grandmother's my father's mother's great grandfather, okay. And then it goes a couple generations back there that we've been able to trace and I have a history and we have a little book that was put together. It turns out, and I didn't know this before moving here to, to the East Coast, that all of this originated on my grandmother's side, my father's mother, in the Eastern shore of Maryland. And we've visited it, it was part of the "Wye Plantation" which was a big plantation, which, incidentally, is interesting. We've had several family reunions over the years. And one or two of them we've tried to visit this plantation, and on one occasion, they tried to convince us that they had no slaves. But it was a little interesting, just an aside.
Speaker 1: That's unbelievable.
Story_ID: 24571
Speaker 1: So do they have the old plantation open for visitors and--
Speaker 2: The house, well, I don't know if it's the original house, but I believe there are original artifacts still there. In fact, there's, there's a cemetery still there where apparently some of the slaves were, were buried. We have been able to identify, well, not myself, but some members of the family have been able to identify probably where the slave quarters were. And, you know, it's just a field now, but, so we've, we've visited this whole area. And we've seen some of the grave sites of some, some, some of the slaves. We've seen some of the areas where people worked, and, and so this house--and I have a picture where we had one of our family reunions in front of this house which was supposedly the slave owner. Again, I don't know if it's the original house, how many times its been rebuilt, but I believe it's at least near the original site of, of the original plantation owners.
Speaker 1: Okay, so any stories that come out of that, that experience?
Speaker 2: Well, we have a little book, and so there's a narrative on many of the individuals who are part of the, the lineage. I mean it's a fairly broad family, and I only gave you one line that, where I, where I'm from. But there's many, many lines, and so I don't know the stories personally, so I can't recite those. But we have put together a small, a small book that, that tries to trace some of that ancestry and some those stories.
Speaker 1: Okay, I was just curious if Frederick Douglass' half-brother escaped slavery too or did he stay in until after the Civil War or, do you know--
Speaker 2: I can't answer all of those questions. I, I don't have all of that information.
Speaker 1: Just curious. And did, is there any, was there an acknowledgement by Frederick Douglass of him at some point, and did they meet or--
Speaker 2: Well, I believe in Douglass' biography, he talks about some of the same people that we have found in our, in our book. And my grandmother, and I'm getting this second hand as well, but my grandmother apparently used to talk about her grandfather, and, and Frederick Douglass being half-brothers. But that's all I know. I don't really know much more than that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Alright. Now, then, let's see. So, but as it turned out, your grandfather wound up in Atlantic City [New Jersey], right?
Speaker 2: He was born in Atlantic City, and that's another line. I don't know anything more. I can't go any further back on his side than, than that. And I can't even tell you where my grandparents met. I, I'm not sure how that happened because she can't, I know she was in--this is interesting. She was in the, on the Eastern shore where, where, I guess, she spent some early years. There's actually a county in Maryland with my middle name. I don't know if there's any relationship at all. Nobody's ever told me if there is.
Speaker 1: Talbot County?
Speaker 2: Yeah, I, I don't know if there's any, any connection at all since it comes from my grandmother's side, and my name comes from my, after my grandfather, who presumably was not from there. But I, and I don't know where he was from, actually, other than Atlantic City. But she moved to Rockville [Maryland]. So she actually lived in this area. And I knew nothing about this before moving here to Maryland because I spent all my early days until I came to, to do a post-doc here, in California. So I, I didn't know anything about this.
Speaker 1: Okay, she--I think that's like Tuckahoe County, Maryland where the, where [Frederick] Douglass grew up on the Eastern shore, I believe, from reading the books years ago. Sounded--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean, and there's, there's--
Speaker 1: Tuckahoe--
Speaker 2: --and he spent a lot of time in, in a variety of areas. So I, I, I'm going to try to tell--
Speaker 1: No, I wasn't asking. I was just--
Speaker 2: --'em, yeah.
Speaker 1: --asserting that in case somebody's watching this, they may wanna know that, you know, 'cause Tuckahoe County, Maryland is where that all takes place. But, okay, so, now, your grandmother, so she eventually ended up in Atlantic City, right, with your grandfather or don't you know?
Speaker 2: Well, he was born in Atlantic City, and had a family house in Atlantic City. And I remember in, I guess my early visits when, you know, when I was really young, like six and twelve, I guess, coming to the East Coast, we used to go out this house. And it was in, actually, it was, it was Pleasantville [New Jersey], which is adjacent to Atlantic City where he had a, had a family home. And so that was sort of their summer cottage, which turned out was larger than the house in which they lived in, in Palmyra [New Jersey]. But they ended up living in Palmyra for, for many years 'cause that's where my father grew up, he and his brother and his sister.
Speaker 1: Okay, Palmyra, alright.
Story_ID: 24572
Speaker 1: Okay, well, what did your father [Wendell Hill Jr.] say about growing up? What kind of experiences did he have? Now, he became a pharmacist, and did, you know--
Speaker 2: That's correct. Well, I mean he told me, he used to be a good student. I, he wasn't particularly a great athlete, so he, he excelled in, in education. He had a couple of really close buddies that he hung out with, some for many, many years. Wilbur Washington is one of them, and they sort of grew up together. They, he, Washington ended up living in the Bay area, so we used to, they used to see each other from time to time. They used to have family reunions. The family reunions that we currently have on my grandmother's side started in the '40's [1940s], I believe around 1946 in, in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania]. The first few years, three to five or so, I think they met every year. And after that, they've met every two years, and we have continued that till today. I mean we just had a family reunion this year, the first one on the West coast. We had it in Long Beach [California]. And so they've had these family reunions every two years. And so my father had lots of cousins, and--'cause most of the density of the family was in, the highest density of the family was in, in the Philadelphia area. So he had lots of cousins, and they, they grew up. So I don't know all of the particulars, but it turns out, he was a fairly decent student. He, after he graduated from high school, he didn't immediately go off to college because he knew he was gonna be drafted. And so he was drafted, and he was in the Army. And he spent much of his time in the Philippines where he contracted Malaria, which flared up from time to time for the rest of his life. And then when he came back, he went to, he went to Drake [University] to pharmacy school there, where, that's where he and my mother met.
Story_ID: 24573
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is there a story about how they [his parents: Wendell Hill and Marcella Elaine Washington] met, that they tell?
Speaker 2: Probably, (laughter) but I can't tell you, not because I choose not to, because I don't know, don't know that story, exactly how they met. I mean, I mean I think that it's, it's, because there were very few people, there were very few African Americans on that campus, that they all knew each other. And I remember asking my father how he decided to get married, and he said that he, he, he found the person that was very, was a good match and, you know, of good quality. And so, and we were having that conversation when I was pondering whether I should get married.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And I asked how he knew, and, you know, we had little discussions about those kinds of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so, so they get married. What would you say, about nineteen what?
Speaker 2: They got married in 1951 on the 26th of August. Oh, ghee, I should know this. Yeah, I believe it was also in Berkley [California], which is where I got married. In fact, we share the same anniversary.
Speaker 1: Okay, so by that time, your father was in school at U-C [University of California] Berkley?
Speaker 2: No, so he was, well, okay, so they were, they met in Drake. They ended up spending some time in Saint, East St. Louis [Missouri], where I think he had one of his first jobs as a pharmacist. And then they, they ended up--and now, the story is fuzzy now. I should know it better, but I don't, ended up on, on the West coast because to being on the West coast, my mother's parents ended up in Berkley. And I'm not sure of that story, how they got to Berkley from Texas. But they ended up in, in Berkley, and so that's where they got married, if my memory serves. And my father, after that ended up in graduate school at the University of Southern California which is in Los Angeles. Now, when I was born in 1952, a little over a year later, as I understand it, the first six months, my mother stayed with her parents in the Bay area when my father was still, was finishing up his, his studies at USC [University of Southern California] and then went on to have positions at Veterans Hospital and a variety of places. I, as I understand it--didn't have a lot to say in this decision, when I was about six months old, they rejoined in Los Angeles and started to set up household there. And then we basically lived, until I, through high school, in Southern California. And we can go into those details, well, at the proper time.
Story_ID: 24574
Speaker 1: Alright, so the family settles into Southern California. Now, where did they live initially in Southern California?
Speaker 2: In Los Angeles [California]. So, when, my mother [Marcella Elaine Washington] then moved to L.A. [Los Angeles] and I believe it's after my father [Wendell Hill Jr.] finished his degree. Again, since I don't have many--my memory at that stage is kind of fuzzy 'cause I was only six months old. They lived in, in an apartment for a while, and if I'm correct, their first house they purchased was when I was about three years old. And one of the first memories I have is sitting out on the grassy area on a sunny day, which could be any day of the year in Southern California in front of some structure which I think was a house, which may have been the house in which they ended up buying. But I don't really know. But I do have this sort of vague memory of sitting in the grass out in the sun. But so, we lived, they lived in L.A. through my, the fourth grade. So they lived on a street called Marvin Avenue in, in Los Angeles, just off of Venice. We're about seven miles from the beach. So if you take Venice Boulevard right out to Venice Beach, which is, of course, famous today--we used to bike down Venice all the way to the beach, my brother. Of course, that was a little later, not when I was six months.
Story_ID: 24575
Speaker 1: When you think about your parents' personalities, their dispositions, their hobbies, habits, mentalities, looks even, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm a combination. My father's [Wendell Hill Jr.] very laid back. He, well, was, he, he died a few years ago. He's very laid back. He liked adventures. We used to go on family drives, and he would con- he would always take the scenic route. And so we would always venture out into new areas. He was all--he was very inquisitive. He always had an answer for all of my questions, and he always liked to know as much as possible. If he were sitting here, he would be able to give you much more detail in terms of the stories of the family than I can do. So he was very, he was sort of a history buff in that respect. He knew lots of history. Benjamin Franklin was one of his favorite people. And so he's a very, he was a sort of, a personable person. He was sort of, had a very loud, voicetrous voice. He was a big guy, so at least when, in his later years. And so he was very much, demanded respect just by showing up. And so, so I've, he was, I, I liked him a lot. And so I sort of take after him in the sense of I like adventures too. I like to do things differently. And so I'm sort of like him in that respect. My, my mother [Marcella Elaine Washington] was, also went along with the adventure. As I mentioned, in her early years she was, liked to run track. So she was, likes to be outside, like to be on the go, likes to do things. She was more sensitive than my father. And I sort of take after that, being very sensitive about people and things of that kind. She probably was a little more organized than my father was and so I sort of go back and forth in that, in terms of organization. Sometimes I'm organized, sometimes it's chaotic (laughter). So I, I guess I'm sort of a combination of, of both and probably even, even in looks. I'm not one to tell you who I look like. You'd have to ask somebody else. So I, I have some of the dispositions. I think I have some of my grandfather's, my mother's father's disposition, who was also quiet and, as I mentioned, was a pastor. I have been accused of preaching. So, so I, I probably take after, after that. My grandfather was one of my favorite people. In fact, I dedicated my, my thesis to him, my PhD thesis because he was always encouraging. Both my parents were always encouraging. We played lots of games when we were growing up. And so they were always encouraging me to--and my brother, to, to explore. They did not get upset when I tore things apart, and mostly, didn't get 'em back together. So they, they encouraged that, that spirit in me, and they were both, they were both very supportive of that.
Story_ID: 24576
Speaker 1: Okay, now, is it just you and a brother, a younger brother?
Speaker 2: I have, there're two of us now. I had a younger brother who basically died in infancy. He, he didn't even, barely survived about a year. And he had some kidney ailments and so he didn't make, he didn't it very long.
Speaker 1: Okay, how much older are you than your brother?
Speaker 2: Four years, just a little over four years older, and he was born in November '56' [1956], and so we're about four years apart, four, four grades apart, essentially.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, now, can you describe I guess the neighborhood you grew up in? I mean did you grow up in one neighborhood?
Speaker 2: No, no, okay, well, that's an interesting--that's probably interesting. Okay, so we, I mentioned we moved into this home in, in Los Angeles [California], about when I was three years old or so. At that time, my brother wasn't born. I remember when my brother was born. He was born in, in a Kaiser hospital in Hollywood [California], basically. I remember seeing pictures, and I don't think I was allowed to go in the hospital. But the, in the, the nursery ward there, they, the, the child's, I guess, bassinet was basically a drawer. So that on one side, the mother [Marcella Elaine Washington] was, had her bed. In those days, the mother actually stayed in the hospital for more than a few second after the child was born. And then the other nursery where the nurses were, was on the other side of this wall so they can share back and forth. So the neighborhood, we lived on a cul-de-sac as I mentioned, just off of Venice. So there wasn't a lot of traffic. We used to play a lot of ball out in the street. So I used to learn how to play baseball and, and football on, on the street. And so that was one activity the kids, all the kids on the block were always playing together. And so we, we did that. And so, in those days, the neighborhood in which I lived in West Los Angeles was a very Jewish neighborhood. And on Jewish holiday, three quarters of the school was absent. But I lived within walking distance of my, my elementary school. So I, I, that's what I did. So I, I guess--and, again, I was very much running with the neighborhood. There were, there was, again, it was, it was a largely Jewish population, but there was also a lot of African Americans. So it was sort of a mixed population. And we all sort of got along. I, I didn't really know anything about racial tensions or racism or anything of that kind. Obviously, it was there, but, you know, my parents did a good job of shielding that, at least at that time. And so we all sort of played, and I didn't have any problems. In fact, there were cases when, when my mother was working, and then after school, I would sort of hang out with some of my friends. I used to go to their, their Jewish center and hang out until my mother could come pick me up, and, you know, that was no big deal. Some friends of mine and I used to go to Sunday school at this little church around the corner from us. And then the family went to a church downtown, a place called "All People's Christian Church". And, again, this was sort of a conglomeration, lots of different people, as the name implied. There were Asian Americans, there were African Americans, there was Hispanics. There were lots of Chicanos, we used to call 'em in those days. And so there were lots of different people, and it was, it meant to have lots of different people. And so, again, it was sort of a melting pot, if you will of nationalities and the ethnic groups.
Speaker 1: But you went to the- (simultaneously)
Story_ID: 24577
Speaker 1: You and your brother went to another church, I mean to--
Speaker 2: Oh, it was not really my brother 'cause he was a lot young in those days, 'cause I, we moved from that house when I was in the fourth grade. And so he hadn't even started school yet. So he was too young. It's just that I had some friends, and we used to go to Sunday school at a little church. But then our regular church was at a different place. And, you know, how you wanna hang out with your friends. And so that's what I was doing, hanging out with my friends, going to Sunday school there. But our main church was downtown. And so, but we, we participated in that too. And I had lots of family activities where we would go up to the mountains for a family--for retreats with the church. So the parents were very much in the, the church activities, and we had neighborhood activities, the schools had lots of activities. I remember on, on Halloween that the schools playgrounds had lots of activities for the kids. And all the kids would come rather than doing the trick-or-treating. We go to this sort of carnival area that was set up for us. And so that was a big, a big deal. Some of my friends on the block were Catholic, and so there was a Catholic school not too far away. So we didn't end up going to the same school, but we, we played a lot together. And so it was just, we just always hung out. The very end of the street, I said, we were at a cul-de-sac. There was, in Los Angeles [California], they have these flood control zones, and they have these, these ditches. And so on, on occasion we get lots of rain, I mean lots of rain all at once. And so they open these to flood this off so streets don't flood. And so we had one of these at the end. And we always used to sort of play down in that area, a sort of dirt kind of area. But, so we used to, could ride our bikes and do all sorts of stuff. And so it was really quite a nice activity for us to, place for us to play in the streets there.
Story_ID: 24578
Speaker 1: Now, let's--what was the name of your school? What was it--
Speaker 2: It was called Burnside Elementary School. Now, the school grounds are still there. It now no longer bears that name. I don't know the current name, but it's still in the same place.
Speaker 1: Oh, and that's the--did you start kindergarten there?
Speaker 2: Well, I actually went to a nursery school.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think, I can remember, Mary Clay was the name of the school. I don't remember if it was called nursery school or whatever. It was some name, school attached to it. But Mary Clay was there. And that's where I started nursery school. Again, my mother taught so I guess I was there, it was more than just day care. I mean it was a school. We did, we had, did stuff, of course, none of which I remember. But we did things--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --educational things. And then I was in kindergarten which was a half day kindergarten, as I recall and, and in first, second, third and fourth grades. And the school in those days had lots of different activities. It didn't have much grass. And we--all of our sports were done on asphalt and, and which is typical of city schools. But we did have a garden. And so we learned how to garden in this school. I then had a personal garden in my, in, in, along our house, the yard of our house and grew a huge pumpkin once. And my brother grew a big watermelon. And so we, we learned how to grow stuff along the house.
Story_ID: 24579
Speaker 1: What were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: Well, in Los Angeles [California], well, when we were, when we lived there, when I was growing up, it was when they were starting to construct what is now the ten, freeway. It goes by the name of the Santa Monica Freeway. But now it's popular to call everything by its number. And so it was the 10, the 10 as you may know, runs from Santa Monica all the way to Jacksonville, Florida. And so that's the same Interstate 10. And so that was being constructed. And so there was no traffic there, but one could ride one's bike up on the, on the on ramps, and that an interesting place to sort of, sort of play. So there was a lot of this freeway construction. Cars were a big deal. So, we, the, the ocean, we used to go to the beach a lot. So I, I remember the ocean. Sunsets, sunsets have always been important in my life. I don't know when it actually started, but I suspect my father [Wendell Hill Jr.] is to blame because we probably went to the beach to watch the sunset a lot because again, we weren't very far away. So, and I've always been fond of sort of the dusk period. Los Angeles has some, a few hills around, and it's nice to get up on the hills and you can see the whole city at dusk and the lights are coming on, the sun's going down. It's kind of a beautiful sight. Of course, in the '60' [1960s] and '70's [1970s], the smog sort of overtook things. But it's gotten a lot better now. It's a lot cleaner now, so you can start to see these beautiful sights again. I like warm, dry days. My, I, I really enjoyed the summer in, in California, where typically it doesn't rain. So it's nice and warm, and the humidity, when the humidity gets up to 30, 40 percent, we consider it unbearable, which I've had to grow, learn a different standard here. I look forward to it getting down to 30, 40 percent here. So, but those are some of the things of, you know, dry, nice, dry weather, sort of the ocean sounds, ocean smells, sort of the seawater. Also, I like going up to the mountains where it's nice and cool, and you've got a pine smell to it. We used to do that a lot.
Story_ID: 24580
Speaker 1: Okay, you seem like you were in a position to get a lot of information from your father, your grandfather, your mother, you know, people involved in school and doing a lot of activities. So, did you like going to school?
Speaker 2: I did like going to school. I had to pause there because I have to go back and think in those, in those early days. I liked going to school. I was, I was respectable in math. I enjoyed math a lot. And I would venture to say that was always my favorite subject, all the way through high school and even into college. And, and so I was a respectable student. When I was in Los Angeles [California], I was probably, and I don't know for sure, but I was probably more outgoing than I was when, to the next phase when we moved--we haven't gotten there yet. So, yeah, I think, I enjoyed, I enjoyed school. I don't remember dreading going to school. Now, I don't always feel that I was treated fairly in school. I know that my parents had to step in to make sure that things were done properly. But that's sort of par for course. I do the same thing with my children. I do distinctly remember my mother [Marcella Elaine Washington] having to go because I, there was something that was going on that it turned out that I had a knack for and I was decent at. And so they changed the rules to make things harder so it was, well, in her interpretation, so that I wouldn't do so well. Whether that's true or not, I don't know. But it's not beyond belief. But for the most part, I think I, I enjoyed that. I learned a lot at home. I had a very supportive life, parents, in terms of studying, providing a good environment to study, providing good study habits to interact, to, to talk about various issues. My mother tended to be more on the side of doing more of the humanity type things, even though she did do the math. I ended up talking to my father [Wendell Hill Jr.] mostly for the science and the math, even though my mother could do both. So there was, I could actually go either way. But they had sort of, as I mentioned, different, sort of different outlooks and different, sort of different dispositions on, on things. My, again, my father was, was really, really much more adventuresome than, than my mother. My mother was okay with that, but he was much more. So if I needed something really, to think outside the box, I would go to my father 'cause he was much, much better at, at that. Now, he was a, a pharmacist, and I should, should mention this because the next phase of the story when we moved from Los Angeles out to Orange County [California].
Story_ID: 24581
Speaker 1: And Orange County [California] then is not what it is today. It was a much less friendly place then. And we moved to Orange County because my father [Wendell Hill Jr.] was a, was the chief pharmacist at what was then the Orange County Center, and it's now part of the University of California-Irvine Medical center, but in those days, it was the county hospital. And he was the chief pharmacist there. So he, he ran the things, ran everything. So I figured actually, that was my role model. I figured that if you have a job, you have to be in charge of everything. And so that's I thought that was normal. So he was, he was commuting back and forth. And, again, this was in the early days of freeways. And so it would take him quite a, quite a long time to go back and forth. Now, he was going against the traffic, but there wasn't even much traffic 'cause there wasn't much out there at the time. So traffic wasn't an issue, but it was just the wear and tear in going back and forth. And so that's why we ended up moving from Los Angeles out to, out to Orange County when I was in the fifth grade.
Speaker 2: Let me ask you this. Now, what was the racial makeup of the school in Los Angeles? I mean did you have any black teachers or, and how many--what (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Well, there, there--I can't give you the percentage, but I did have African American friends. As I mentioned, there was, there was, it was lots of different people there. And there was a lot of, it was a lot of Jewish population. And then in those days the, the Jews and the African Americans were, were very close because there was a lot of parallel issues that one had to, to deal with. And so they were, we were very, very close in those, in that time. But that's not all. I mean there were other people. So there were lots of different kinds of people around. But I can't tell you what the makeup was then. Probably, I'm, I'm just guessing, but I would guess that the African American population, at least in, where I was, was probably less than 10 percent. But I'm just guessing because I say, I don't, I don't really know because this was, we were in West Los Angeles. It was, it was not terribly far from, there's a street called Fairfax and Fairfax runs right through the heart of a real concentration of a Jewish population. But then there was another neighborhood, the name of which I can't recall, that was very much a Japanese-American population. And, of course, this was not too long after World War II. So there was a lot of issues, having to do with the, you know, the U.S. concentration camps we had for, for the Japanese Americans. And so there were lots of those kind of issues. So there was a lot of, of, of, all of us sort of trying to walk together. And so it was not a lot apart. But as I mentioned, I didn't really recognize the overt racism that probably did exist in, in the same way as, as I could sense in my later years.
Speaker 2: Okay, and Orange County is a little different.
Speaker 1: Orange County, it was, it would slap you in the face--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --and we can go into that. But, so in Orange--in Los Angeles, so that, so it's very much more of an outgoing person then because the same barriers didn't exist or at least the, these racial-type barriers that, that sort of tries to put you in your place that--I, I don't remember that being a problem in, in Los Angeles when I was, when I was there.
Speaker 2: Okay, now--
Speaker 1: And the schools were fairly decent in, in those days as well, in that neighborhood. Now, the neighborhood's changed a lot since then, but--
Speaker 2: I didn't ask if you had any black teachers?
Speaker 1: Yes, you did. And I'm trying to think, and I can't remember any in, I can't remember any teachers. In fact, I can't even remember any of the teachers I had in Los Angeles, quite honestly. The first memory of teachers that I can remember and identify were in, in Orange [County]. I don't know why that is, probably because none of them stood out as being particularly bad or, you know, or good for that matter. So I, I don't recall, but I know that there wasn't, there was no problem with teachers 'cause as I said, my mother [Marcella Elaine Washington] was a teacher in the Los Angeles school district. So it was certainly part of the, the heritage there, so there were certainly teachers.
Story_ID: 24582
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, now, what was the name of the school in Orange County [California].
Speaker 2: Okay, well, we moved to Orange County. We moved to the City of Orange, and actually, I have to tell you a little bit more prior to that too. I, the elementary school that I, that I attended was, was called Taft Elementary School. However, it was a, it was a brand new neighborhood, and so the school had not even been built. And so we used to have halftime at another school, which I believe was called Cambridge. And so that was a little bit further away. So half the year, we went to this other school until the school which I attended opened. But let me back up prior to moving out 'cause my parents had been thinking of moving out for, for a couple of years. But, again, it was in Orange County. Orange County was a very hostile place in those days. I mean this is where Knotts Berry Farm was and this is where Disneyland was, eventually came. Neither of them were very friendly toward anybody who wasn't of Aryian extraction (laughter). And so the whole--
Speaker 1: Well, is there a story associated with that--
Speaker 2: I'm getting there.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, I just--
Speaker 2: I'm getting there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, so they had been looking for some time to move into, into Orange County. And as I understand it, one of the places they had identified was in a place called Garden Grove. Now, they had issues with having realtors show them places. I mean that was a problem. And that, that was a well-known problem which precipitated the whole Fair Housing Act thing that came up in California in, I think it was '63' [1963], if I'm not mistaken. So they had problems, but they had identified a place, apparently. And, again, this was all unbeknownst to me. I didn't, my brother and I knew nothing of this as, as it was going on. I only have known this in, in my later years. And so as I've been told the story, is they identified a place which was apparently either next to or on the same block as one or more policemen. And as I understand it, my parents were threatened by them and the policemen, in particular, that if they chose to move into these houses and on this block, that their children would have problems, threatening even kidnapping or even death. I don't know the details because they, again, as I mentioned, were very careful to shield us from all of this ugliness. And so as far as we knew, life was sweet. I mean, I, I must say that my life has been extremely pleasant compared to many. I've had everything I've ever needed and most things I've ever wanted. So my parents provided everything my brother and I had to have, and then shielded us from some of these problems that, that existed. And they well--they knew it very well, of course. So that story, of course, they didn't (laughter), they didn't take the challenge. So they didn't move into that neighborhood. Now, so that search continued apparently, and they ended up purchasing a house from a builder called [Joseph] Eichler, I don't remember his name. Eichler built these sort of very contemporary homes in the Bay area as well as in Southern California. And so they bought a house, an Eichler house. And one of his, his mantras was to sell to everybody. And so he did not wanna have this racism propagate into the selling of the homes in which he was, he was building. And so we moved into this, this neighborhood. And there were several of these Eichler. And so we moved into a neighborhood, and, you know, it was a tract home. So, I mean, you know, just carbon copy, lots of people have the same model. But that's where we moved, and that's the school in which we, we lived. And so, I mean that wasn't without problems either because there were other people living on the block, and as I understand it--again, this was shielded from me, petitions were raised to, even the people who lived there wanted to have us kicked off the block, that they were not successful, but that, that happened.
Speaker 1: They were new too, right, I mean everybody was new. This was a new development.
Speaker 2: It was a new development. The home, my parents built the home, meaning that they identified the spot. They identified the model, and we watched it being erected. So we used to have picnics. We used to go out and have picnics in the frame, and we watched it as it, it went up. So, yes, it was a new, a new house, a new neighborhood. But nonetheless, it still had these issues. Again, I'm getting this second hand. I, I didn't know this firsthand. So I didn't know any of the problems. I do know interesting things happened (laughter) while we lived there. One of the things I used to do was to fly model airplanes, these little Cox airplanes that you used to fly on a string. And so I used to get the neighborhood kids to hold the plane while I started the engine, and then they'd hold it until, I got to the string. And I used to go around in a circle and fly 'em. The kids used to love it. There was one incident where we were doing this, and they were kind of loud, but, you know, it was during the day. It wasn't at night, on the weekends, in the evenings or whatever. There was one time when our next-door neighbor, all their kids were called in. And so the rest of us were out there and we're flying this plane. And, so, you know, I landed it, and we're finished. We were getting ready to wrap up. And within, I don't know, a few minutes, maybe 10 minutes of when our neighbor's kids were called in, the police rolled up. The police rolled up and said that we were disturbing the peace because we were making too much noise. Now, all the kids were loving this, and all the kids were playing out there. And my suspicion was that the neighbor, since they were called in, so they wouldn't be out there when the police came, called, called the police on us. But I don't have any facts about that, but, so those were some interesting things that, that took place in, in that neighborhood.
Story_ID: 24583
Speaker 1: What was the name of your school in Orange County [California]?
Speaker 2: The elementary school was Taft Elementary School.
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought you said you started at Taft and then you all went to another--
Speaker 2: Well, I went to an elementary school, junior high and high school there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So the elementary school, I spent two years there.
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 2: And those teachers I remember because those teachers were, they did suffer from this complex of not understanding the contribution that non-European Americans provide. And so that was a struggle.
Speaker 1: So just to put it into context, well, what year is this? Now, you're--
Speaker 2: Okay, well, let's see. I have to go back--
Speaker 1: You're in 10 in 1962?
Speaker 2: This is the '60's [1960s]. This is early '60's [1960s].
Speaker 1: This is '62' [1962], '63' [1963] when you're, you know, that'd have to be when you're nine or 10 years old, right?
Speaker 2: It must have been '62' [1962], yeah.
Speaker 1: Fifth grade, so you're 10, that's '62' [1962].
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was, I was, yeah, I was 10, right. So this is '62' [1962] when I started. In fact, I had my, I had my tenth birthday there at a park, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright, okay.
Speaker 2: So, that was interesting. It was very, very different. Finding a church home was also interesting because unlike the church in Los Angeles [California] we attended where all people were welcome, the churches in Orange County were a very different breed. When we'd show up, and, in fact, the church we ended up, we settled on, a number of families left when we settled in. So the, the Christian community, at least in those days, well, suffered from the same issues that the, the greater Orange County suffered from. I mean this was the time when the John Birch Society was there, you know, and African Americans weren't particularly welcome. Jewish people weren't welcome. There was a significant Chicano population, but they were often in, in small, almost ghetto-ey type areas. So they struggled as well. And, and so my parents largely had friends that were, were Jewish 'cause there just weren't very many African Americans. I was usually the only one in the entire school. It wasn't until I got to high school where there was one or two others. But I was almost always by myself. And this is something I didn't understand because as I mentioned, in Los Angeles, there were other people. It wasn't an overwhelming population, but there were certainly other people that I could look at that were like me. That was not the case in Orange County. I was, I was it. I was by myself, and that had a very interesting effect on me. I became much more introverted, much quieter because I just had the sense that I, that I was not accepted, and I didn't belong. I had that sense largely because I was told that on (laughter) most, either in action or sometimes even verbatim. I remember in the sixth grade, when Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy], this was, I guess this was November [1963], and it was sort of a warm November afternoon--all our schools were outside. All the doors opened to the outside 'cause this was Southern California. But it was, I remember it was a warm, sunny day, and it was late in the afternoon as I recall when this happened at least. The sun was going down 'cause the sun was coming, 'cause our, our room looked toward the West. And this janitor comes in, beaming with this big smile, saying, "the President was shot". He was, he was elated, the fact that the president was shot 'cause this (laughter) was a very, a racist place that was very much conservative Republican. And, you know, it was very, very challenging to survive. We had to do, we had to do these, we called--I forget the name of these newspaper reports in the morning. And we used to rotate, and we'd have to come, get some clip from the newspaper and give sort of a news report. And, of course, we, we took the "Los Angeles Times" which was a fairly decent paper, but everybody else had the "Orange County Register" which was very, very conservative and always very, very slanted, and, you know, it was sort of the Rush Limbaugh of the time. And everything was slanted toward the Right, and, yeah, it was, it was different. And so that was a struggle. In fact, I, in my high school yearbook, I said, one of my greatest achievements was to survive Orange County.
Story_ID: 24584
Speaker 1: I had teachers in junior high school that refused to give me a grade higher than a "C". I had an English teacher that absolutely refused 'cause that was designated the grade that I was worth. And so I had, I had to struggle through that. And, and that's part of the reason why I think I really gravitated toward math because math was either right or it was wrong. That was no value judgment. It, you know, it wasn't rated on a scale from zero to 10 because they didn't like what I wrote. Either it was right or it was wrong. And, and I was fortunate that I was usually right. So I sort of gravitated in, into that respect. But even there, I had a problem. And in junior high school, I went to a place called Peralta Junior High School, seventh, eighth and ninth grade. I was put off into the lower math class when I went to junior high school. Now, I, I was always at the top of the scale in, in math. But they put me in this lower, this lower junior high school. Now, my parents were wise because they, you know, I talked to them and I fused about it because this stuff was trivial and I wasn't learning anything. And so, they suggested that I go talk to my teacher and see whether or not I could get some extra work to do. Now, knowing, now being a parent, I know what, probably what they had done. They probably had already greased the tracks. They probably had already gone to talk to the teacher, and they figured out how to make this work. But I'm very grateful for them for at least giving me, making me go talk to the teachers because it's not something that I would have normally done. But it helped me go. And having already greased the tracks and having already known that I was going to be successful, that was very, very helpful. So those are, that's sort of an example of the kind of things that my parents would do to, to encourage me. And so I eventually did this and ended up in a more appropriate math class as, as the years went on. But struggling in the, sort of the humanities and all of these where the scores were always very subjective, I always felt that I was on the losing end of the stick because what I thought, didn't agree with what the teachers thought who somewhat echoed the, the population, I was in trouble, despite their rhetoric to the contrary, I was, I was in trouble.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, so your grades suffered as a result of this kind of conflict, I take it?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they did, but now, in high school, the teachers were a little bit better. And so I, I didn't have this, but in junior high school and in elementary school, that was an issue. And, fortunately, we weren't playing for keeps then, but, but that, that certainly was an issue.
Story_ID: 24585
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of your high school?
Speaker 2: I went to Villa Park High School. It's part of the Orange County [California] or the Orange school district. We had three high schools in those days, Orange High School, Villa Park High School and El Medina High School, and then there were a number of junior high schools and elementary schools. Well, the two junior high schools that fed my high school, Sierra Villa was the other junior high school, and my high school had a very interesting population. It ran from people who were very wealthy to sort of average-type folks to some less well-off people. So we all had to sort of fit together. Now, before we get too far, what allowed me to sort of maintain my sanity in Orange County is I picked playing baseball. I loved playing baseball, and I still remember going to my very first baseball game when we still lived in Los Angeles [California]. The Dodgers had just moved out, and we went to see them. They were playing in the Coliseum in those days 'cause the Dodger Stadium had not been built. And I remember pestering my father every time the innings changed, I was concerned that the Dodgers were not losing because they had to go out into the field. I didn't, obviously, didn't understand the game. But I started playing in, in Los Angeles, but I really picked it up in, in Orange. And I, I played, but even there, things weren't always fair. The, the (laughter) field wasn't level, and so I had to struggle there too, all the way through high school even. But I played a lot of baseball, and I had some really close friends who played baseball with me. I even had a friend, we didn't go to the same elementary school, but we went to the same junior high school. And his parents were from Texas. And this is very interesting. We became, we were very close friends. He was actually in my wedding. I was in his wedding as well. We were very close, but his parents would never allow me to spend the night at his house. I just could not spend the night at his house.
Speaker 1: Did they ever let him come, let him come to your house?
Speaker 2: I don't ever recall him spending the night at my house either. Other friends did, but I don't recall him spending the night. And there--
Speaker 1: So there was kind of a social line that--
Speaker 2: There was, there was a line there. And as I think about it now, I don't ever recall being at his house when his parents were home (laughter). He had a bigger, he had an older brother who's a number of years older, who was a pilot and actually flew for Eastern [Airlines]. So he lived in Connecticut or somewhere, but he was there from time to time. So there was really, that's really interesting tension there. There were other people in, in high school that refused to (laughter)--I mean it was just, it was, it was so bad, it was funny. In high school, I played in the band. I played a clarinet. I started learning how to play the clarinet in fifth grade, and I sort of kept that up all the way through high school--well, I actually dropped it a little in junior high school, and picked it up again in high school. And there were people, there was this one young lady. We were friends, we were just friends, and she was dating this Chicano guy, and her parents were livid about that. And so there were all of these charades she had to play in order to see this guy. And she, one time she was so fed up that she wanted, as a joke, we never did this, she wanted as a joke for me to take her home 'cause she says, if they were fed up with him (laughter), they would just go non-linear if I showed up. But we, we were just friends. But there were things like that that happened, and so we had to turn 'em into jokes in order to survive. And so I, I took up baseball, and I took up band because dating was not going to be a real big issue because there was just, the landmines were just, there were just too many landmines. And so I, I basically didn't really do a lot of dating. I had one friend--
Speaker 1: So there were no African American females?
Speaker 2: I was, I was it.
Speaker 1: You were the only one.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was it. Now, my parents tried to get me into Jack and Jill when I was about junior, about a junior or almost a senior in high school. But by that time, you know, that didn't work so well (laughter) because I didn't know any of these people. And they all knew each other. So that, that sort of flopped. And so the thing that kept me sane was mathematics, doing baseball and, and playing, playing in the band.
Story_ID: 24586
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, where were we? So in the junior high school years, I told you about the math. We got that, that organized. I told you about this English teacher. I started taking science then, and, I, I found it, that it wasn't particularly interesting to me. You know, we did botany and, and I just looked at plants, and I, had a hard time staying awake. It just, because of the way it was presented. The chemistry is a little bit more interesting. The physics was taught without calculus and so we didn't have calculus in high school in those days. And so I didn't understand the worth of it. I said, well, this isn't very useful because all you can do is straight lines and things. And, well, what if things are curved, then what do you do? And so I didn't think physics was worth much (laughter). But, you know, so it wasn't until college when I took physics and calculus together, I said, oh, well, now, now, it makes sense.
Story_ID: 24587
Speaker 1: Well, there was a, somebody had a story about Disneyland or Knott Berry Farm, those attractions (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, well, you know, Disneyland, Disneyland, in particular, was very lily white in those days. You didn't see any employees, and we went to Disneyland a lot. And as a, as an employee of the county, my father used to get lots of discount tickets. And they had Orange County night where, you know, it was very inexpensive. And so we used to go out to Disneyland many times a year. But it was absolutely clear that you saw nobody working out there that looked like anybody except for somebody from Europe. It just didn't happen. Now, that's not true today. It's very much a different place today. Now, Walt Disney may not be so pleased with the way it is today, but in those days he was, still had, he was still alive, and he still ran things. And so that's the way it was, Orange County. It really reflected Orange County in those days and the sentiment and the attitudes it had toward people. And, and so, and Knotts Berry Farms, I don't think was very far behind in, in those days. But we spent time at these places 'cause it was amusement. I mean they took our money (laughter), but you couldn't work there--
Speaker 1: When you were--
Speaker 2: --although I did work when I was a senior in high school, when, my senior year in college, I worked at Disneyland one summer. So I got 'em back.
Story_ID: 24588
Speaker 1: Alright, so when you were growing up, now, were you, did you pay attention--now, you flew planes, did you ever try to make a rocket?
Speaker 2: We used to do these water rocket things. And we used to play with fireworks that were legal. And so we played with fireworks. Firecrackers weren't legal, but we played with fire--I was, I was never one to break the rules and break the law. I mean I, I stood within the boundary of the rules and especially in Orange County [California] 'cause I figured if I deviated, that's it. I'm, I'm in the slammer and it's over. So I did not, I did not tempt any of the rules. I, I stayed within bounds. And so, and we did these sort of these, you might remember these pump-up, water things, and we'd blast these things off 'cause our--my elementary school had a big field area. And so I, we would go out there and play. And we also then moved some of the stuff for the planes out there, so, away from the, the streets, so we wouldn't "disturb the neighbors".
Speaker 1: Did you like science fiction?
Speaker 2: No, I wasn't particularly a science fiction fan. I mean I was a "Star Trek" fan, I mean in, in high school, I watched, certainly watched "Star Trek". And I guess science fiction in the sense of space exploration, and I followed that quite, quite heavily. I mean in '69' [1969] when we had the, the landing on the moon, we were glued to the television, watching that. So that was, that was important. So I liked that aspect--
Speaker 1: And you were a senior in high school then, I guess, right, in '69' [1969]?
Speaker 2: Ah--
Speaker 1: It'd have to be, right?
Speaker 2: I can't remember what time of year it was. It depends on what time of year it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, it was in July.
Speaker 2: I graduated in 1970.
Speaker 1: It was in July.
Speaker 2: So this was probably before my, before my senior year.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Yeah, it was before my senior year.
Speaker 1: July 20th, 1969--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so your memory's better than mine (laughter)--
Speaker 1: --walked on the moon. That's my birthday in '69', so that's why--
Speaker 2: I see. So that's, you have an advantage.
Speaker 1: (Laughter), (unclear).
Speaker 2: We used to watch, see solar eclipse. I remember we had a, we had a solar eclipse, an almost total solar eclipse when I was, when I was growing up, which was really pretty cool. And we made these, tried to make these things to, to see it. I don't think we succeeded. We, we were afraid we were gonna burn our eyeballs out, so we didn't actually look at the sun (laughter). But it got really dark, and so it was pretty cool.
Story_ID: 24589
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I, I should tell you a little bit about my, the activities we did as a family. We had lots, we had a family vacation almost every year. And most of our vacations were, were camping. So we did camping trips all over the West. I mean we got as far as Washington in the North, and as far West as, I guess to Wyoming and I guess Yellowstone, Grand Canyon and the Painted Desert, all that area and then all the stuff in between. We never made it to the Rockies [Rocky Mountains], but we were always West of the Rockies, but we did, that was our, that was our summer vacation as a family. So we spent a lot of time together, couple of weeks. It was inexpensive, and we got to learn a lot about how to survive. And we, we would see bears and all sorts of stuff out there, and we learned how to, how to survive. And so it was just the four of us, put the tent in the back of the station wagon, and we'd head off. So that was a lot of activity that we did. We spent a lot of family time when we used to drive to Northern California to see my grandparents who lived there at the time a lot. So I got to know my, my mother's side of the family very, very well. Her sister, who never was married, always sort of took care of my brother and me. And so we'd see her a lot. Her brother, who was about twelve years older than me, considerably younger than her, lived not very far away. In fact, he had, when I used to walk to my elementary school in Los Angeles [California], he had, he and his wife had an apartment. And I used to stop there on the, in the, in the morning before I went on to school because he was, his job wasn't until later. So he could take, take care of me in the, in the mornings. So we had lots of family. Family was extremely important and that, it was even more important in Orange County. So I never felt like I was missing anything. And I always felt that I had the strength to, to go out every day because my family was so, so strong that all of the insults and all the issues that were, that happened on the outside sort of just bounced off because I had my family. I didn't need these people. So, and that was, I'm sure by design, and so that was, that kept me, kept me sane.
Story_ID: 24590
Speaker 1: Okay, now are there any particular teachers in high school that were significant in your development?
Speaker 2: Yes, absolutely. Now, I can name several. I, I still like math. I always liked math, and my, my high school Geometry, I consider my favorite subject. And the Geometry teacher was sort of a crusty guy, and at first, you would think you wouldn't, I wouldn't get along with him. But he turned out to be a really good teacher, I guess because I did okay in his class. And so, we, we got along. But the teacher that had the, probably the most influence on me was my, my chemistry teacher, high school chemistry teacher, Mr. Kortuchi (ph.), who also turned out to be my Sunday school teacher at church we ended up joining and spending a lot of time. So church was also still an important aspect of our life, although when my little brother died, that caused an issue. But I'll--that's a side story, we'll tell, come back to. So, Mr. Kortuchi used to always preach, "Get the big picture". And so he would talk about the chemistry and all the details, but he said, he'd stop and say, look, let's get the big picture here. Don't forget what this is all about. And so that's something I've always taken away with me. And I went back to visit him, I think once, and he was very excited to--what he called (laughter) "a successful pupil". And I told him just this, that his, his idea of getting the big picture has always stuck with me and which I try to propagate to my other students. So if you ask another saying that I like to say, I don't say it as much, but "getting the big picture", and, you know, not getting, not getting tripped, tangled up in the forest, and, you know, back off so you can see all the trees, that was very, very important. And then, of course, being the Sunday school teacher, you know, he had sort of a, sort of a faith side to him as well, which I found very important because I've, having the, having the faith is, I find, extremely valuable and meaningful in my life which is also another story, which I'm, will go into as well--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at the appropriate time.
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people suppose that someone going into physics, especially at the quantum level, would find it hard to maintain, certainly, a fundamental Christianity. I don't know what kind of Christianity you have, but--
Speaker 2: Well, we can go into that. And I, I don't think, obviously, I think that's possible because I find myself in that situation. And I wanna talk about that. But I think it's a little wait because it, it comes in a little later in my, in my walking, walk here. But so, he was very, very instrumental. There was a coach. I, I, again, I played baseball, and I played all the way through college--high school. And I, growing up in Southern California, we were always outdoors, we were always playing sports. And so we basically played two sports. I, I didn't really play football very much because I (laughter), I didn't understand the game because I went out for football, the school team, once, and they put me at guard. And at guard, you know, you got all these people running into you. And so I, it wasn't very--it didn't take me long to do the calculation. I said, now, wait a minute. Why are all these idiots running into me? And, and who's the idiot here? (Laughter) And so I don't--this is not fun, having people run into me. So I, that's when I just said, football didn't make sense to me. I, you know, if I can't throw the ball, and they didn't let me throw the ball. They wanted me to be guard. So I said, no, this isn't, this isn't gonna work. So I ended up playing basketball and baseball. And I was okay in basketball, and the high school basketball coach always wanted me to go out for the team. And I wanted to play baseball, and I was also in the band. And those two, the baseball and the band conflicted with the, with, with basketball because at my high school, they had--in those days, in California, everybody had to take PE every single day. And, and so, what they did with, with sports was they allowed the, the students on the sports team to have the last period of the day to be their PE period. And so they could start to practice at that time. And, but I couldn't do that because I was in the band 'cause the same thing held with the band. So we had early PE. So we basically had two period of band, so we had two hours to, 'cause I was in the marching band. And so we'd go march and practice and things. And so that conflicted and I preferred that to playing basketball. But he was after me almost, for, every year to come out to play basketball. He was very encouraging and very, very--I never had him really other than a PE teacher, but he was always very solicitous and very, very useful. But I, I ended up not doing that, but playing, playing baseball. My band teacher was also very good. And so that was a, he was an inspiration. But the one teacher in high school that I would, that really stood out was my, my chemistry teacher.
Speaker 1: And that was a--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so.
Speaker 1: And who was, what was his name?
Speaker 2: That was the name, Mr. Kortuchi.
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought he was geometry.
Speaker 2: No, no, no, the geometry teacher, ghee, I don't remember his name.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, that's right.
Speaker 2: But uh...
Story_ID: 24591
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so, now, did you, in high school, did you take any leadership roles? Did you run for student government or anything like that?
Speaker 2: No, I didn't, I didn't do any of that. I mean I was the president of the band or vice president. I think it was vice president of the band. And so I, I had, you know, a leadership role there. We had to, the band ran a fireworks stand, and so that's how we supported ourselves. So at the, you know, school was out some time in June, and then we had this fireworks stand for a couple of weeks. And so we made some money that way. And so we had to orchestra that kind of thing. But I, no, I didn't do any of that. I was part of the Key Club, and some friends talked me into being part of that. So I, I joined that, but my, my, most of what I did was, was on the baseball field. I mean I was sometimes captain of the team. I was a short stop mostly, sometimes, third base. But, so I was, did a lot of leadership on the infield when I was playing baseball there.
Speaker 1: Who is your hero in--
Speaker 2: Maury Wills.
Speaker 1: Maury Wills, okay.
Speaker 2: Stealing bases. And so I used to steal lots of bases. When I, I played little league where you couldn't steal bases. Then went to Pony League and Colt League and then in high school, and then in junior high school too, where we could steal, and so I was stealing bases. One time (laughter), I think I stole seven bases in one game and stole home twice (laughter).
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, the great Maury Wills. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, he was my hero.
Speaker 1: Alright, those were the days when the Dodgers had a heck of a team and--
Speaker 2: Yeah, they'd win by one run. They had the greatest pitchers, had no hitting. If they get one run, the game was over.
Speaker 1: Drysdale, Koufax--
Speaker 2: Drysdale, Koufax, right.
Speaker 1: Junior Gillman, Maury Wills and--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Dusty Baker, I think, was he playing--
Speaker 2: No, Dusty Baker, no, no, no. He's a lot older, a lot later. I guess, Willie Davis, Tommy Davis--
Speaker 1: Right, that's right.
Speaker 2: --Johnny Roseboro, catcher, and so as I mentioned, the Dodgers and the Giants had this rivalry. And my grandfather, I found out later through my grandmother, used to pretend to be a Giant fan, just so that we can argue back and forth. So he would take me to the game. We'd go to Dodger, Dodger Stadium, when he, when they came to visit us. We'd go to Candlestick, as I mentioned, and freeze out there. But I found out from my grandmother that he was secretly a Dodger fan, and, because of Jackie Robinson. And so that, that really said a lot. And so--
Speaker 1: There's a whole generation of Dodger fans and that whole generation was--
Speaker 2: Yeah, so, that was, that was important. But, so he would come to my, my baseball games. My parents came to my games. My father used to umpire my little league games and always make the wrong calls when I was up as far as I was concerned, 'cause he called me out on a strike that almost bounced on the plate. And I couldn't believe that one time. But he didn't wanna show partiality, but I, I think he admitted later that that may have been the, not a good call. But anyway, they were, they were supportive even in my sports too. And so that was, that was helpful. So my, my grandfather and I used to talk about baseball a lot. He used to, he used, we used to pitch (laughter), and so he, he enjoyed that. So we would always talk about strategies and then things, and he used to love to watch me play. And I used to love to play for him, and so, and he even told me one story about--and I don't know if this is my grandmother who he was doing, but he told me about a story. He was playing baseball, and he was trying to show off for some young lady in the stands. And, again, I don't know if it was my grandmother or not, but ended up sliding and ripping his pants (laughter). And he was so embarrassed, but he, we really enjoyed that, that connection.
Story_ID: 24592
Speaker 1: Okay, now, Dr. King [Martin Luther King Jr.] died when you were in high school too, right?
Speaker 2: That is true, which was also interesting. Again, like the case that I told you about when Kennedy [President John F. Kennedy] was shot, I used to have a group of people, some of whom were friends, that I ate lunch with. And there was one, one person that I didn't know really all that well, but he was, he ate with us, was very annoyed at the fact that the flags were at half-staff after King got shot. And he said some very negative things, and so, again, this was Orange County [California]. And so that's the kind of thing that would happen from time to time, but, yeah. And that's the only, that's the one thing that stood out to me how, when, when that happened, that this person made this statement.
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, were you the only black student at, in high school or were there anymore?
Speaker 2: Well, there was one other guy, and there was a female student who was a couple years ahead of me. So we didn't really overlap very much. There was a guy who played on the football team that I, I didn't know very well. And he wasn't there the whole time, so I don't really know his history. But for the most, I was, I was basically in isolation by myself.
Speaker 1: Alright, so, so when you were--now, how were your grades when you were on the verge of graduation?
Speaker 2: They were decent, you know, got me into the University of California.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you didn't rank as one of the top students or valedictorian or--
Speaker 2: Oh, no, no. I wasn't, I wasn't that--I mean my grades in, in the sciences and the math were clearly much better than they were in the humanities. I didn't really like the history and English and so I sort of endured it and did okay. I mean the teachers were much more fair in high school than some of the teachers in junior high school. And so I got grades that were more representative of, of my work. You know, and they were A's and B's, mostly, and, and those scores, probably more B's in the English and History and then A's and things in the sciences and the math. And so that's where I was going in, in that direction anyway.
Story_ID: 24593
Speaker 1: Did you receive any counseling about college?
Speaker 2: Yeah, they told me to go to junior colleges, said I wasn't worthy of going to a university. And so high school counselors weren't very useful. So I obviously didn't pay attention to them.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now, I had wanted to go to UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles] and because I was in a place that was so devoid of, of diversity, I wanted to get to a place that had more diversity. I wanted to get back to Los Angeles where there were African Americans. We, we had, there were a number of people of Mexican extraction. Again, we called them Chicanos in those days. And, and so I was friends with many of them. But as I mentioned, there wasn't, wasn't much interaction with African Americans at all. So I wanted to get into a situation where there were more. My parents, I think my mother in particular, was a bit concerned that UCLA was too large, and I would get lost. But that's basically what I want. I wanna get in a place there were enough people that I would have enough, cross section of people that I would get along with. So, although she denies it, she decided I did not wanna go to UCLA. And so I ended up going to University of California, Irvine, U-C, Irvine. And so that's where I was--but that again, was in Orange County, which was interesting because the year I went there, my parents moved to Detroit [Michigan] 'cause my father got a position at Wayne State [University] and Detroit General Hospital. And so he, they moved and sort of left me there. So I was, again, in Orange County, but now I was even by myself. But in my, probably, starting around my junior year, I decided that I needed to have more of an identity with the African American community because I had been, it'd been so long since I'd been in Los Angeles, I didn't really know what that was all about 'cause my upbringing was different from what the typical upbringing was supposed to be, which, you know, as we all know, there is no such thing as a typical (laughter) upbringing. But, but I was really isolated from most of the things in our community, with the music, with the dancing, with, you know, just the interaction. All of that was missing from my, from my upbringing. So I decided that I would, I needed to somehow get myself infused into the community somehow. And so in, in junior high school, I started to try to find music and at least to tap into the music. Now, I had one friend. We were both in similar math classes, and so we, we were friends from math who like Motown. And so, so he knew more about music than I did (laughter). But so, that was one way I started getting music. And I started listening to the radio. And there was this radio station that used to come out of Mexico. And you may have heard this guy. This guy's name was Wolfman Jack. He used to pump this music out of Mexico, and so they didn't have to abide by the same power laws. And I'm told, I'm told you could get his station all the way up to Washington. And so, so I, I would listen to that because he would play some music, where I couldn't get many of the, the stations from, from the city, from L.A. out where I was. And so that was my only way to start to, to learn about the music. And I started to buy albums that were, that got me involved with that. And so that, it was my hope in going to UCLA, I'd be able to plug into that. Well, that didn't happen. I went to Irvine, and at Irvine, it was a small community. I think there were maybe 300 students that went to, went to Irvine. And-
Story_ID: 24594
Speaker 1: These are black students?
Speaker 2: Black students, yeah. I mean the school was about, it started I believe in about 1965. So I graduated in 1970 from high school, so I was like the, you know, the sixth class or something to start to matriculate there. And there were, many of those students were part of an initiative to get more African Americans in college, into the U-C. This prior to Bachy and all that stuff. So, it was, it was deemed in those days beneficial to the country to get more people involved with education. Now, unfortunately, some of those students were not trained well enough to survive, and many of them did not survive. And, and so part of this whole effort needed to be rethought. But it was helpful for me because this was a community in which I could now try to ease myself in. Now, they knew the community more than I did. So I had to figure out how to, to navigate this, and that was a little bit touch and go because I didn't know a lot of the stuff. I didn't know how to dance, you know. I didn't even know the names of the artists. So I went to these parties and I went to the dances, and I--my ears were wide open, trying to listen and, and learn. And so I learned a lot about what the, the community and what our culture was about because I, I didn't have that coming up in high school.
Story_ID: 24595
Speaker 1: The other important thing in college was getting, you asked about being a Christian and being a scientist at the same time. Well, this was something that took place in college and started, continued off into graduate school as well. I mentioned that we would go to church, was a church-going family. My grandfather was a pastor and so that was really important. When I was twelve, I was baptized, and I thought I had an understanding what all this was about. And I think I probably did to the extent that I could at twelve years old. But then we, I told you we had a, I had a baby brother who didn't survive much more than a year or if that long. And I think the whole family was sort of devastated, especially my parents. And, and their belief and faith, I think waned at that point. And although we continued to go to church, it certainly didn't have the same meaning. And so when I went off to college, you know, church wasn't all that big a deal. I thought I wasn't gonna go, but then I ran into a group of people called the "Navigators" which is a Christian organization which was big on campus. And they challenged me to go to bible studies and things which I did. And, and then they, there was a conference that they had challenged me to attend over Spring break, which was in Colorado. And so it was a two-day bus ride there. So I said, okay, I'll go. And that was actually significant because during that time--I had some specific questions. This, this was a group of mostly European American students, and I was trying to get myself more involved with African American students at that time. So I had a little in, trepidation there. I didn't necessarily think that--and I didn't see very many other people there. So I wasn't quite sure about these folks. But on that trip, I met a pair of, a couple from, I think they were from Oklahoma, this African American couple. And we had talked about, you know, where does, how does, how do African Americans fit in this whole thing with Jesus and stuff because the story you hear, the popular story you hear, at least in those days, sort of was very Eurocentric. And that was, that was a concern of mine because that didn't seem like that was quite the way things should be. And so that was one issue. The other issue was this fact that, okay, now, look, I'm getting, I'm studying to be physics major, and I need to tell you how that happened. I, I jumped over that. How can I be a physics major and have this belief in God at the same? Aren't there some problems here and some inconsistencies? So this couple was one, and, and that would, suggested that, you know, there are people of, of from the African American community which take this really seriously, and so, that means I need to think about this. It's not just sort of a European thing that's coming down the pike. And then, the keynote speaker at this conference was a physicist from, from Australia. And I got a chance to chat with him a lot because I was a physics major, and, and he just talked a little bit about how he handled this, these, these inconsistencies, how he handled the, the fact that science and the bible don't agree and all these kinds of things. And these are all alleged issues, of course. And so it was very, very helpful to hear his perspective on how he, he took all of this. And it gave me a lot of hope that one could walk this path and be honest on both sides, be honest with your faith and honest with your, your vocation and your studying of science. I've come to the realization now that, that many of the alleged conflicts aren't there. And a lot of the debate between Christians or so-called Christians and scientists are off point. They're, they're missing the point. And we can chat about that if you'd like, but so, I, I recognized that this is not, not really an issue that is going to force me to choose one or the other. Now, that, that debate didn't go away within myself. It continued in graduate school, and when we get there, I can tell you a little more about that too. And so that, those were the two significant things that happened, trying to integrate myself into the African American community to understand what that whole walk was about and what, what our community values because I didn't have a first-hand knowledge of that, at least not through high school and to understand how faith can inform my science as well as allow me to be honest with myself in, in both fronts. So that was the sort of beginning of that adventure which continues today, but was, certainly had its, was in its infancy at that point.

Speaker 1: Now, was there a black student union?
Speaker 2: There was a black student union. I mean there weren't a lot of issues. There was (laughter), I went to one protest when I was there. Some of the students were concerned--and I don't quite honestly even remember the issue. But we went to the chancellor's office to have a discussion, and again, I don't remember what the issue was, and trying to be part of this and having been in Berkley [California] through the '60's [1960s] 'cause I went to visit Berkley all the time. And so I, you know, I know the history there, I felt compelled to be at least part of this activity. But then we parted companies when folks started talking about, "Well, even if we get kicked out of school, we have to do this and that and the other." And I said, well, now, hold it (laughter). Now, I, I don't remember the issue, but whatever the issue was, I didn't find it, it rose to the point where I needed to threaten my, my education over this. But there was a sort of a, there was a black student union, but I found, not so much working with the union, but getting to know people and having friends, and meeting friends. And so I met several people that became my roommates, two people, in particular, were my roommates. And, and so, and just getting to know who, getting to know the people themselves. And, and so that's how I, I got involved and sort of got a little bit more of a heritage than, than I had before. But, yeah, there was a, there was a black student union.
Speaker 1: Okay, I just wanted to know. Were there any black studies courses, did you take any of that?
Speaker 2: No, my, again, my black study course was self-formed in, in getting in, and talking to people and becoming part of that. So, no, I didn't take any of that. There was, there were, there were things along those lines, but I didn't take any of those courses 'cause I, my science and math sort of occupied all of my, my time.
Story_ID: 24597
Speaker 1: Now, but in terms of the Christian, the bible studies, you said you resolved like the contradictions. And you were beginning to tell us what some of the classic contradictions are, and, but can you kind of walk us through what they are and how they relate--
Speaker 2: Well, I mean there are many things that people say. I mean the obvious one here that's pretty big these days is evolution versus creation. And, of course, in my mind those aren't necessarily conflicts at all. What appears to be clear is that there--well, what is clear is there's order to the universe. And if you, the more you study, the more intricate you find things with the, with the science and how it, how it functions; the fact that we can sit down and write down an equation to predict anything, I find this miraculous. And so that sort of suggests that there is a designer. Now, some would argue that evolution is, is anti-Christian. I don't happen to hold that belief. I mean God is God. He can do whatever he wants. He could use whatever means he wants to get us to the state we're in now. And so I think those, some of those comments are, beliefs are a little shallow, personally. So I think the whole debate about whether you can have evolution, and whether you have creation. I don't know that there is a debate. I mean, again, God could use anything he'd want to get, to get us to the state that we're currently in. And what is certainly clear, as you look out at the universe and how it goes, is there seems to have been an origin. There's an origin to what we know that often goes by this Big Bang. And our science doesn't allow us to [go] beyond that, so we can't tell what happened prior to that, at least not at this point. But there are many different theories out that suggests how the universe has evolved to its current state. And those in and of themselves are not inconsistent with, with a beginning, as you might read in the bible. The bible is not specific about how things occurred. If you take it literally, and you take the fact that Adam had to name all of these species and you take the number of species that existed, even at that time, well, that couldn't be done in one day, one physical 24-hour period. So the whole idea of whether we came into existence in seven, literally, 24-hour periods, or whether it's more of stages, you can debate that all you want. But if you look at specifics of what it, what it says, then you have--well, you conclude that there's something that, that took place. I happen to believe that the time periods were not 24-hour, literal days, but I have very close friends with whom I, that I respect a lot, who have come to the, a different conclusion. And, another saying, if you wanna say what my special sayings are, is that "Sometimes we have to agree to disagree". And so we disagree on those points. But I don't let those points of disagreement affect things in which I do agree. And, and I think part of Orange County taught me that because there were so many people with whom I disagreed, especially on politics. I just disagreed with them. If I had to agree with everybody before they could become my friends or have any of my respect, I wouldn't have respected or had any friends at all. So I have no problem with disagreeing with people on, on some, on some issues, even if they're core issues. Now, I mean there are some things that if my wife and I were to disagree on what marriage is all about, then that would be, that would be a problem. But that's not the case, but, so there are some deal breakers, but for the most part, there aren't many deal breakers. And so I can disagree with a lot of people on lots of issues and still respect them and still be very close friends with them and spend time with them. So, so, those are some of the classic issues. Now, some of the other issues that come out, if you look at the way the bible is written, there are different styles, and then there are comments, "Well, how do you know it's right?" and all of these things. And there are efforts to try to prove the existence of God or disprove the existence of God. I personally don't feel you can do either. And, and that's part of the whole, that's part of the whole issue is, it's a faith issue. You can't prove it in one way or the other. It does inform decisions that you make. And that's, that's what I do, and it, it gives you an understanding of why we are, we are here and something that goes beyond just what we do here on, on earth. And I, my oldest daughter just graduated from Stanford [University]. And she, we met some of her professors, and one of her, her advisors would talk to us, and, and said, you know, here at Stanford, everybody's smart. So that, that's not, that's no big deal to be here and be smart. But your daughter really had something special, and then, you know, the special he was talking about was this faith that she had and this, her Christian walk. And, and I think that's really true, that, that can, that can go beyond just your ability to, to do something. It also informs how you, how you do something and the fact that you bring in that different quality to your life, and that bring--that you can, you can share with, with others. And it's a, it's a comfort.
Story_ID: 24598
Speaker 1: And so, at, so you were trying to do two things, get back in touch with the black community on one level and then try to, you were trying to resolve some other issues around Christianity and science?
Speaker 2: That's correct, right. Now, so I, I went to UC-Irvine as a math major. And, and because math is what I did best, and I didn't think I ended up liking, I didn't really understand what engineering was. And, and I sort of--chemistry was interesting, but it didn't seem like it sort of met the issues that--it wasn't really what I wanted, and I, 'cause it--so the reason I ended up in physics was because I had to take a physics course. My first roommate had a girlfriend, it turns out, who was a physics major. And, and so we were chatting, and so she said that, well, you know, if you have to take physics, you definitely don't wanna this particular physics because you're gonna flunk this course. And I said, okay. I've never flunked anything in my life (laughter). Even with the Orange County teachers, I never flunked anything in my life. So I said, I'm gonna take this physics course (laughter) 'cause it just was a challenge. And when I took this course, I absolutely loved it. I mean, as I told you, in high school, the physics course that I took was done without calculus, and so you couldn't really do any of the really interesting problems. And you could only do simple problems where things were moving in straight lines, and, you know, you had constant velocities. You couldn't really even do acceleration very well. But I took this course, and, you know, in conjunction with calculus, and it just absolutely made sense, and it was just common sense. Now, it helps that calculus was developed by a physicist, Isaac Newton, you know, was basically a physicist, and he developed calculus. Of course, he wasn't in isolation. There are others who participated as well, but so, it really, physics and calculus just went hand-in-hand. Now, the issue I had with math is that one had to spend a lot of time proving things which sort of seemed obvious to me, and I sort of got tired of that where in physics, you just sort of take the math, and you run with it. Now, physicists need mathematicians to make sure we're honest because we have a tendency to use the math where maybe it's not legal. So we do need mathematicians to keep us, keep us straight. But on the other hand, I just enjoyed taking the math and applying to the, to the physics to solves a problem. And in some sense, I find that physics is a little bit more challenging than the math because you have to, the physics, the math is the language of physics, and so you have to find the right equation and use it in the right way to actually explain what you're trying to do and then make sense of it all. So all, I found all that to be really fun and very, very enjoyable. And I ended up doing well in that course, and--
Speaker 1: Now, what was the name of the course?
Speaker 2: It was a first, well, in, in the University of California, at least in those days--I don't know what it's like today, it was a five-quarter sequence for, for physics majors. And so this was the first, first sequence of, well, they call it Physics V, but the first, the first quarter of that. And we basically just studied the harmonic oscillator which turns out to be, you know, one of the critical issues in physics. Everything we do, we would try to reduce to a harmonic oscillator. And so it's just the whole thing about harmonic motion and, and, you know, the solutions and how elegant the solutions are. And so I just found it just fascinating. I just loved it. And it just made so much sense. And then, so I just took the next series of courses and just, it just, you know, I just loved it and tended to end up doing reasonably well. And so the professors used to tell me that I had a knack for understanding the, the kernel of issue--the issue of that, better than others, you know. And whether they were just trying to puff me up or not, I don't really know, but, you know, I, I tended to, to do well. And I had some really good professors there.
Story_ID: 24599
Speaker 1: Who were some of your professors in the (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, there was Frederick Reines, who was, who was a Nobel Laureate, who's, well, he wasn't at the time, but he was the one who, did the experiment to find the neutrino, the first time. Another guy that I really saw many more times was Gordon Shaw. Now, he taught me, he was a, he was a--both these guys were high-energy physicists and so that's what I thought I really wanted to do, high-energy physics. He was theorist, Reines, not  Reines, Shaw was, and so I, I took math physics from him, you know. And this was really great 'cause I learned about how to do contour intervals on all sorts of really cool stuff. And so, both of those individuals wrote recommendations for me. And then there was another guy who was a plasma physicist, this guy named Nathan Wren, and he was the guy who had made this comment that I was able to see--I had a class with him, and I guess he was somehow impressed with questions I answered and questions I asked in, in class, and said that I was able to see these things better than others. So, and I, I, I really, I did fairly well, and, and liked it, got mostly A's in, in the physics and in math, except for one class, I didn't do too well in math. I'm not sure what happened. But that was the only, that was the only flaw that I, I had. And there was another guy who was a year ahead of me who had gone to Stanford, and he was doing high-energy physics. And so I said, wow, that's interesting. So that's where I decided I'd wanna try. And so, but, you know, these things are never really guaranteed. But I ended up going to Stanford, but I thought I was gonna work at Slack 'cause I wanted to know it's the high energy physics. Now, I did have an interest, I should mention that even in high school, my first, the first laser that I ever saw was, was a guy from my church. His name was Darryl Birch. He was a physicist from Ohio, actually, but he lived in Orange. He was a family friend. So he arranged for me to go to his job. Ford Motor Company had a, had a lab in Newport Beach in those days. And they had a Ruby Laser, and so he arranged for me to go see my very first laser which I thought was impressive. So, so he was always a good friend. Mentor is probably too strong a word, but he was always encouraging. And so that was good to, to have that. And so these other three that I told you at, at Irvine were, were probably the closest thing to mentors I had.
Story_ID: 24600
Speaker 1: Alright, so Stanford [University] now. So your path through Stanford was, there was a fellow, you said, who was ahead of you who was, had gone to Stanford?
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's a friend of mine from, from Irvine [University of California] who went to Stanford. And I'm trying to remember now how much encouragement he gave me to, to apply. I think he was very encouraging. But I, I think more than encourage (laughter), I think what he did was, he was able to tell the people at Stanford that, that this guys is okay 'cause we, we talked and knew each other when we were at Irvine. And, you know, he was always, he was always a really good guy, very smart. So, you know, I sort of gravitated toward that. My, I have a tendency to gravitate towards smart people, hoping some of it will rub off on me. So, so my time at Irvine was, was really, really good. I, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed meeting these people. I found the whole, the whole, the science thing fascinating in talking to these various people who'd done various things in the world. Irvine was a relatively new campus, so they had pulled all these really good people in from the other U-C [University of California] campuses to start the, start this campus, and really enjoyed talking to Reines. And I, I should point out, one of my highlights--you asked whether I had leadership roles. In college, I was part of the Society of Physics Students. And the Irvine chapter of the Society of Physics Students, the faculty allowed us to, once a year to choose the, choose one of the colloquial speakers. And so you had talked about science fiction. I wasn't really much of a science fiction, right. I didn't read comics and I didn't read all that stuff. You know, I would rather just sit down and work out math puzzles and things. But Isaac Asimov was, came up on our list. Some of the guys knew him and said, oh, hey, he would be cool to have come give a colloquium. So we tried to contact him, but he sort of blew us off, said he didn't fly and didn't wanna come. So that didn't go very far. But, and then we had this idea that, well, Cal-Tech's [California Institute of Technology] not too far away. Why don't we just drive up to see if we can get somebody from there to come. And, 'cause we all had taken these courses, and one of the things that we did in these courses is we worked, we used to watch these Feynman, Feynman Lectures. And so we all knew who Feynman was, and we knew he was at Cal-Tech. So we said that, well, why don't we just go see if he'll come? So we, we, since being blown off when we tried to write the letter to Asimov, we said that we'll, we'll, this time we'll go to the person and maybe we'll have more success because it'll be harder for them to say no if we're actually standing there. So we drove up to Cal-Tech which wasn't too far away. And then it took us a lot of nerve to get, to knock on his door, but we finally did. And we knocked on his door and went in and talked to him. And he was very open, very solicitous, great guy. And then he said he'd come under one condition, and that condition was that after the talk, he would have dinner with just students and no faculty. We said, well, we can, we can probably figure that out. We can probably, we can probably do that. And so he came and gave a talk and absolutely fabulous talk, no notes, just, just talked. And then he spent about three hours or more with a handful of us. I think there were maybe about six or seven of us at dinner. One of the guys in the group in which I ran was, was married, and so his wife was a little better at fixing food than, than the rest of us. So she fixed us a pot of spaghetti. And there were these, these college kids sitting in the, in the room with, with Feynman, just--and he told us about the bomb and all sorts of interesting things about how carts follow, you know, the carts when they take the luggage off your plane and he started talking about the mechanics of that and started talking about his first job as an engineer and how he was told that the one thing you need to know as an engineer was always pick something from the middle of the table and, because that's why the tables end because they fall apart at the end. So pick something in the middle, and you're sure to have something that's gonna work. And so it was, absolutely fabulous time. So that was one of the highlights of my time at Irvine, being able to have dinner with some of my colleagues, with Richard Feynman. And so that was, and he was a really special guy. And he was really warm and really listened to us, and we could ask him questions and he answered the questions, and so, you know, it's not often that you get a chance to spend time like that with a, you know, a person of that quality.
Speaker 1: That's a great story.
Speaker 2: So that was really kind of a fun time.
Speaker 1: So his lectures were like on public (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, and when he was, when he was at MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], he, they filmed some of this lectures, and then they, I guess some of these educational companies would, would sell them. And so we would listen to some of them 'cause he just had a wonderful way of explaining the science. He was just absolutely crystal clear, and he just, just--his mind was just fabulous, and he was able to think through, and his explanations were just absolutely beautiful, and the way he can describe how things would work. And then he had a series of books too that he wrote, this three-volume set that we all had purchased, and we'd read those things, and that was great. So it was just, you know, just, you know, it's, it's--we were groupies as far as that was concerned. I mean now, this is, you know, this is a superstar, and so we had a chance to see him.
Story_ID: 24601
Speaker 1: Okay, so Stanford University--
Speaker 2: Stanford, okay.
Speaker 1: This is, what, 19--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, so I spent four years at Irvine [University of California], graduated in 1974, and then I went off to, to Stanford. I, I mean I had other opportunities to go elsewhere. In Illinois, I could have gone, I could have stayed at Irvine and so I was considering other places. But, and Michigan, but actually, I was a little--there're two reasons I went to Stanford, well, maybe three. One reason, I was, I was a little afraid to leave California. I'd never left, been anywhere but California. Two, I wanted to go to SLAC, I thought I really wanted to work at SLAC. And, and three, I think that of the choices I had, Stanford probably was the, was the best choice. And so, and it turns out to be extremely a good place for me to go, and I really, really had a good time. Now, the first, first quarter, couple of quarters that I was there, it was, it was challenging, 'cause, you know, all students go through this, well, now that they let me in, now I gotta prove myself worthy. And so you spend a lot of time trying to make sure that, in fact, that was, that was, in fact, the case. But I, my first advisor was Sandy Fedder. We were all given advisors. I had a very small class. We had a class of fifteen people, so it was very small. So we all knew each other and we all came from various places, some places even smaller than Irvine. But Stanford was very good at bringing people in from a variety of places. There were people from MIT [Massachusetts Institute of Technology], from Harvard [University], but then there were people from the U-C [University of California], and then there were people from smaller places that you hadn't even heard of. And we all sort of took the same classes and worked together, and we formed really great groups. And it was really a special time. So Sandy Fedder was my first advisor. And poor Sandy had to go through holding my hand the first few quarters and saying, you know, I'm really doing okay, 'cause I took a course from him, and he was also a wonderful lecturer. And so I had wonderful notes which I have, well, I haven't referred to them recently, but some great--learned a lot from him. In fact, I saw him not too long ago in Sao Carlos, Brazil, not--in last, last year. We were both at a, a workshop, a winter school which is their summer school. But I was, I was really touched because he was, he was lecturing the week ahead of me, but he stayed--I don't think he extended his stay, but he extended his, his--he delayed his trip to the airport because he heard that I was coming in, so we could at least cross, cross paths. So it was nice to see him. So he was one my advisors. He was always very encouraging when I, when I was there at, at Stanford. As I mentioned, I, I thought I wanted to do high-energy physics, and so my first position at Stanford was out at SLAC at the Positron And Electron Storage Ring where they, they collided these electrons, and so in the center of mass, was the same of the laboratory frame. And so you get much higher energy, and it's a much easier interpretation of the data. So I worked there for a year, but the way high-energy theory, experimental high-energy physics is done, you have these very, very large groups. And I felt that I was getting lost. It's just one of the units, and I wanted a project that, you know, was really my own project. So I decided that I wanted to move to more of a bench-type of, of environment. So I ended up working for Arthur Schawlow in laser physics. And so Arthur Schawlow and Ted Hinch (ph.) had a sort of a joint group, and so that's where I ended up with a PhD, working, working on my PhD with him. Now, Schawlow was a sort of a big guy, and he's Canadian actually. And he tells these really dry jokes or, or dead, but I got along with him really well. I, I really enjoyed him. He scared me at first because having come up from Orange County, he sort of gives you this image of being the grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, and he was sort of that personality. And that, that was sort, it scared me because when I went to talk to him, he, he--the first, one of the first things he said was, well, I've never had a black student before. And I said, uh-oh. Alright, what am I getting myself into? But it turned out, he was great. I mean he was a big Jazz fan, and so we really got along. We, we had that connection. He gave me some of his albums. He worked very late at night. He worked on weekends, and I found the best time to talk to him was either late at night--we'd walk home together, you know, around midnight or so when I was working in the lab or, or, you know, coming in on Saturday morning, and he had his music playing. And I could come in and he was more relaxed. During the week, he was always very busy because he was always going off here and there. But on the weekends and late at night, he was much more relaxed, and I was able to really get, get a chance--
Speaker 1: Now, how do you spell his name?
Speaker 2: S-C-H-, Schawlow, S-C-H-A-W-L-O-W.
Speaker 1: --L-O-W, Schawlow, okay. Arthur, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what was his background?
Speaker 2: He was Canadian. Let's see, I believe he went to the University of Toronto, and then he was a post-doc, I believe he was a post-doc at Columbia with, with Charlie Towns. He actually married Charlie Towns' sister, so they became brother-in-laws. Charlie Towns is the one that got the Nobel Prize for, for developing the maser, which is the microwave version of the laser. And then he was at Bell Labs for, I don't know how long. And then he came to Stanford, and he was at Stanford until he died.
Story_ID: 24602
Speaker 1: Like a lot of people, you didn't take time to savor a Master's degree. You went straight through--
Speaker 2: Well, you got a Masters in the process. But I mean, you, you were admitted to the PhD program, and, you know, after a year or two years or so, you take some classes, you, you get--you can get a Master's degree. I think there was one person that I know of who was at Stanford who left with just a Master's degree. But that was never, never the intent. So I actually do have a Master's degree, but, you know, I finally filled out the papers to get the Master's degree. But that was never my intent. So, yeah, I just, I really just went straight through.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's what most--
Speaker 2: And that's what typically you do in physics because the Master's degree in physics is not really sufficient to go on to do research and to do your own lab. So really you go on to do the PhD. And so that's what most people, most people do.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, now what was your thesis your, I guess, your dissertation?
Speaker 2: Well, the title was on "Intercavity Absorption Spectroscopy". When I was in the Schawlow-Hinch group, we were developing lots of these tools for doing laser spectroscopy. The laser was a new tool that allowed, that enabled you to do the spectroscopy on atoms and molecules to a, to a precision and accuracy that was never, been possible before. And there were all sorts of tricks that you can play to get over the fact that atoms are moving in the atmosphere, and they're Doppler shifted, so you can get inside of the Doppler profile, and you can see all this wonderful structure. And you can make some fundamental measurements on, let's say the various constants that we, we hold dear. I mean, like, there's the, lots of different kinds of constants that, that govern how, how things work. There's something called the Rydberg constant which is a constant which basically, you can, you can use it to tell what the structure in the spectrum of, of the hydrogen atom is and then for, for the other atoms too. But there's that. There's, of course, there's the, the, what's known as the coupling strength of the electromagnetic interaction. And so those are related by other constants. There's something called Planck's constant, and so and some of these you can easily measure with laser, some, some you cannot. And then there's, when you have a theory of the atom, you know, the simple theory of the atom is a boar model of the atom, and it sort of looks like the solar system. Of course, a more refined theory of that is Schrodinger wrote down a wave equation which talks about looking at matter as a wave which is a more correct way of, of looking at it. And so, now, the atom is not just in one spot, but because of this whole idea of a, of a wave, we can't really pinpoint an electron or any particle for that matter at, at a location with a particular speed, like you can in classical mechanics. So you have this so-called uncertainty principle. So you have this, sort of a fuzziness to, to where, where the atom is. And you can pin it down in terms of its momentum, but then you don't know where it is. And it's, I mean it's everywhere or you can figure out what its, it's momentum is or its speed is, but then you can't tell exactly how fast it's going and so forth. But, or sort of vice versa, you can figure out where it is, but then you don't know how fast it's going. So, again, it's got this fuzziness to it. But then there's a whole thing on relativity. And so all this is classical, so you, you put in relativity, and then, then you have a whole nother set of things that, that come out where you have this, this interaction. And so what Feynman became famous for, this, something called quantum electrodynamics which allowed you to quantize all of this business with the, the electromagnetic interaction, you quantize that. And that gives rise to a whole nother series of things, and you end up with particles and anti-particles. And, and then there're another set of constants which, which govern that. Then the electron is kind of funny, and it's got something that's got a quality called a spin. And all of that plays a role in all of this. And so, and some of this, you can, you can measure in atoms very accurately with a laser. And so we were in the process of developing all these laser techniques to, to make these measurements. And in my thesis, I looked at trying to make very sensitive measurements using the laser. And so what you can do is you can put the absorption which is very, very weak, which would be very difficult to measure on ordinary, with an ordinary spectrometer, put it inside the laser and the laser is a very non-linear medium. And so then, fairly small changes in the absorption come out to be really large, make a very large signal. And so I was trying to perfect that. That technique has, has gone on to become something called "Cavity Ring Down Spectroscopy" today. But in those early days, I was struggling trying to understand how this whole thing worked, and then there were some really strange anomalies that we tried to understand and, and sort of tried to put some models together. So that was my, my whole thesis, to try to look at very trace elements, either small elements which would be useful for detecting small traces of, of stuff or something that's very, very weak. You could also look at it in this way. And then you can study very weak things. So I studied some isotopic oxygen and looked at the first, made one of the first measurements of, of that sequence, which you couldn't do ordinarily.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you got married too at Stanford?
Speaker 2: I did, my, my last year, I got married. I met my wife at Stanford and she was an undergraduate. And so we met her senior year, and then she went off to Columbia [University] to go to the Journalism school there, and then she came back. And then we got married when she, she came back. So we spent our last year there married.
Speaker 1: In New York or--
Speaker 2: No, at Stanford--
Speaker 1: Okay, alright--
Speaker 2: --yeah, she came back from New York.
Story_ID: 24603
Speaker 1: Okay, so, now, you went on to pursue some post-doctoral studies, didn't you?
Speaker 2: Yeah, so at Stanford [University], you know, I, I should say that my, my--this whole idea of this Christian and how that interfaces with science continued when I was at Stanford. And I was active in the, various ministries there. In fact, we, we started a lot of graduate ministries at, at Stanford, and we started, my wife and I and a couple of other friends were instrumental in getting sort of a ministry, a bible study started for African Americans primarily, which went on for a number of years after we, we left, a number of other people that carried that through. So there were activities that were not meeting the needs, as we saw them for the African American community at, at Stanford for the African American Christians, and so we helped to start a bible study there. And so I spent a lot of time again, trying to understand how these two things can work together because I obviously was getting deeper and deeper into, into the physics, and so my understanding was gone beyond sort of the superficial, that, that happens as an undergraduate. And, but still I, I found friends who were smarter than me who had, had a belief in science--I'm sorry, in faith in God, and, and were very strong scientists. So that was very encouraging to, to have them, and we had lots of debates and talked a lot of these things out. And so that even continued. And that's still part of what I, what I do now. I'm campus rep for, for the Navigators here on this campus even. And so it gives me some activity with, with students. I don't get to see many students, but I do get to talk to some.
Story_ID: 24604
Speaker 1: How are, what's the, I guess the attitude of most scientists about Christianity?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't know that there is "an" attitude--
Speaker 1: Towards Christianity.
Speaker 2: --I, I think that there's a lot of things, and like I said, I think the, the discussion is, sometimes misses the point. And so there are people who are very adamantly against it, very vocal against this, that it's all nonsense. And, but then there's a community of, of Christian believers that scientists, I mean physical scientists even, that take it very seriously. So there's, it goes on both sides. A number of, of people that I know attend church, and so they would be what I might classify as nominal Christians, and there are others that are extremely strong. I had a really close friend who moved to Iowa, who was a very strong Christian. He was a physicist here, he was on the faculty here. But he moved to, to the University of Iowa, and he's on the physics faculty there. So there are people who are very, very involved, and there are people who are very antagonistic. So it sort of runs the gamut. I don't think there is one, one feeling that you can identify. So it's sort of an individual thing. A lot of people are--
Speaker 1: Proportionately, you couldn't say that, you know, so many, say maybe this proportion of scientists don't have any--(unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: I don't know. I think the majority would not take a, a significant fraction would not take a stand either way or at least they wouldn't voice an opinion publicly. And some of those would feel that it's right and some of those would feel that it's nonsense. I, I can't say what the fraction is. You know, I'd just be guessing. I've encountered both. I've encountered people--I mentioned Charlie Towns. He, I was at a meeting, a little workshop with him in, in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and I didn't know this at the time, but he, he was a Christian. And, and that, so that was an interesting time to, to talk to him. And he had faith. It turns out, had another connection with him. My, my wife's parents were very much involved with community activities in, in the Bay area. They lived in Oakland [California]. Her mother still does. Her father died a few years ago. And it turns out that Charlie Towns came to their house one time. They didn't really know him, much about physics in those days. But that's one of the joking way I said that her family was okay. They were vetted because they had a physicist actually come to their house. But they didn't know who he was. But, so, you know, there're some very famous people that you would, that, that you would know that are Christians, and then some of those same people are with antagonistic. I, I think it's unfair to try to set a percentage because, you know, physicists tend to have minds of their own, and, you know, they'll make up their minds based on the facts as they see them. Of course, we're not devoid of having prejudice like everybody and we can be unfair about the, what we, what we think. But, and I think for the most part, most of us would, would weigh, weigh the issues and come to a rational decision based on where we think the, the facts lie. Now, I think that it's also true that a significant fraction of people would not give it the time of day, and they wouldn't, they wouldn't even feel it's worth weighing the issues. But on the other hand, there's another, there's another group of people who, who feel very strongly about it. But I would not be able to venture to say what the fraction is.
Story_ID: 24605
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, alright. Alright, so, alright, so post-doctoral studies. Now, you--
Speaker 2: Okay, post-doc, so okay. I came to, and my wife and I decided that-we, we had sort of this binary problem where she was, had just gone to the J school, the Journalism school at Columbia [University], and so she was, wanted to be a journalist. And so we had a couple of options. She was working at a, a news service in the Bay area, "Bay City News Service" was the name of it at the time. And so we could either go--well, we were looking at three different options, going to, going to Bell Labs area, which would be, you know, either in Murray Hill or Homedale, New Jersey, going to, coming here to Washington, D.C., what was then the Bureau of Standards, now NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] or going to Chicago where I had an offer from a guy named Charlie Rhodes who was at the University of Illinois, Chicago Circle. He used to be at SRI which used to be called Stanford Research Institute, but it was split off from Stanford back in the '70's [1970s] because of, they did do some classified stuff. So it just assumed the name SRI. So he moved from SRI there. So I knew who he was and knew some of the people who worked with him. And so I got invited to come there. We ultimately ended up choosing to come to Washington because my parents, who spent seven years in Detroit--my father at Wayne State [University] and at Detroit General Hospital, then moved to Howard [University] to become the dean of the pharmacy school there. And so having not lived with my parents for almost ten years, I thought--lived near my parents for almost ten years, we thought well, it would be kind of fun to be close to them. We fully intended to go back to California within a couple of years, and so that two-year period hasn't come up yet, 'cause we--that in 1980 when we first got here (laughter). So I came here. I, I did a post-doc. I was what was known as a National Research Council post-doc at, at Bureau of Standards and worked when they, out at the facility here in Gaithersburg [Maryland], and so I did a lot of laser spectroscopy type things there. And from there I went on to, to the University of Maryland because again, we had this binary thing that my wife, during my post-doc years had a job. And so I didn't wanna displace her and Washington is a good place to get both of us working at the same time. So we decided that, well, you know, maybe I should just, at least for the time being, try to get, launch my career here at Maryland. And so I came over here. I had, had an offer here to, to work. So.
Speaker 1: So you were in the National Bureau of Standards in Gaithersburg, right?
Speaker 2: In Gaithersburg, that's correct.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, what were you working on at the Bureau of Standards?
Speaker 2: Well, I was in what's known as the Vacuum Ultraviolet Spectroscopy group or, or, I guess it was part of the radiation physics division. And so they had a technique, two, two gentlemen who hired me basically, had a technique for looking at spectroscopy of ions. And they did this by taking a laser and creating this long column of ions, which is very, highly unusual. And so that opened up a whole area of being able to do spectroscopy on species that you couldn't do before. And so my, my thesis topic, which was basically doing things that you couldn't do before on species because of a technique, this was another technique. So I worked on that technique and, and worked on a variety of experiments along those lines. So, again, doing sort of spectroscopy, this time on ions, and which you couldn't do absorption, absorption spectroscopy on ions before 'cause you'd never get enough of them in one spot to do that. So, that was what I've done. And then I started developing new techniques as I was thinking of moving on to, to Maryland. I missed looking, using continuous wave lasers, which is what I did all my thesis work on, continuous wave lasers. These lasers added, were repulsed lasers. And, and so I started doing techniques which got me back toward doing continuous wave lasers which is sort of what I'm doing now.
Story_ID: 24606
Speaker 1: Okay, University of Maryland, 1982, right?
Speaker 2: Right, so, so after my time at, at the Bureau of Standards--I had been offered positions at the Bureau of Standards, but none of them were in sort of the basic research thing, end of things, which is what I really wanted to do. So I decided not to stay there, and that's, but I became a, sort of a visiting scientist which would allow me to continue to go out and to do research. And I still have that status today. It fell off for a while, but then I picked it up again 'cause I still collaborate out there. In fact, I have a student who's working out there right now. I, so I came here to this place called the Institute for Physical Science Technology, which was an interdisciplinary institute. Now, I was very naive in those days, and so I did not negotiate a great start-up package as I, as I would have if I had had, more savvy. But I didn't know that I needed to have, have more. The only, my father was a great resource because Howard [University] tried to get me to go there as well, and he advised me that wherever you go and whatever you do, get the offer in writing. And so I got an offer from Maryland in writing, but I--Howard would never put down on paper exactly what they wanted to do. They were promising the world, but they never put anything down on paper. And so that was sort of a, a red flag. I was also offered other positions at other places, and I looked at [University of] Notre Dame. And I looked at Corning had a lab, of all places out in the middle of nowhere in New York. But that would not solve, neither of those places would solve my binary problem of my wife being able to work at the same time. So that's why we decided to stay here in Maryland so that she could continue to work. She was working at the "Washington Star" in those days, and then eventually went to the "Baltimore Sun", the "Evening Sun", and so I, I came here. And there was a position that they put together for me which at that time was not a tenure track, but eventually, it turned into a tenure track position as a regular system professor. And then I just sort of went up through the ranks, ranks there. Now, my background was always physics, so I taught in the physics department. And it was, when I first came here, the, the director of that institute thought that people in the institute shouldn't teach. And I thought that was a little odd to be on a college campus and not teach. So I would, I negotiated a way to, to teach at least once a, once a year. I now teach regular, every semester like everybody else. But that was very helpful because I, that helped get to, to know students and so I could start to populate my lab with, with students.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay. So, now, during the--I've got some confusing notes here that says you were--now, what do the numbers 1982 to 1986 mean to you? Is this a period of time that you were in a certain position here or--
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, like I said, the first position was a manufactured position. They put it together for me 'cause they wanted me to come here. And it was not a tenured track, but the, what they promised was that they would make this a tenure track appointment as soon as they could. And, and the reason there were some, there were some legal issues with their charter and of this institute and, and the bylaws and such that prevented them from hiring directly in the institute. So, that had to all be straightened out which it eventually was straightened out. And so it allowed them to actually hire me as an assistant professor. And so that's that period between '82' [1982] and '86' [1986]. But it effectively acted just as, like an assistant professor 'cause all that period of time counted toward my tenure clock. So I came up for tenure at the right, at the usual time.
Story_ID: 24607
Speaker 1: Okay, now, it says here that somewhere between '82' [1982] and '86' [1986], you spent time as a visiting scholar at the University--at the Institute Venezelano De Investigaciones in Venezuela.
Speaker 2: Right. When I was a graduate student, there was a visitor who came up from Venezuela, and he happened to work with me while he was on sabbatical. And so he had, he invited me to come visit him. And so I think that was around '83' [1983] or so. He invited me to come down and I went down and spent a week with him, giving lectures and just spending some time at his institute. And so that was what that was about.
Speaker 1: Okay, so did anything significant, did you learn anything significant--was this your first time out of the country?
Speaker 2: It was not the first time out of the country. It, 'cause I had gone to a conference when I was at NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] in England and Ireland. Of course, not counting Mexico and Canada. It was the first, that trip to England and Ireland at the end of my time as a post-doc was the first time I had actually been out of North America. And then this trip to Venezuela was the second time I'd been out of North America.
Speaker 1: Okay, so anything significant come from this trip? I mean other than, I know it's a new experience and everything, but (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, you know, well, it was an interesting experience. I mean I enjoy seeing how different people live. So scientifically, there was not a whole lot that came out of that. Experientially, it was, it was fascinating to see how a different culture lived and to see how the science was, was done. I mean it gives you great appreciation when you go to a country that--well, when you go to countries that are not in Europe or Japan, and you see the quality of the institute and what they have to work with, it's, it's very humbling because they're very proud of what they have, but it's not, the quality of what they have is nothing like what we have and what we have to work with. The same is true when I go to places, countries in Africa and I go to some of their labs. They're very humble. They have very humble laboratories, but these people are extremely proud of what they have. And they're working very hard, and they make the most of what they. And so this was the first time going to a country, going to a lab that didn't look like my own lab. It didn't look as polished. It didn't look as, you know, you didn't have all that you needed to, to do everything you wanted to do. They struggled to do what they, to, to do this. So that's the first time I'd ever seen that.
Speaker 1: Okay, some of the countries outside of the, I guess the, the economically top-tier European and Asian countries are, they're, they don't have the equipment to really do the same kind of measurements that you can do and other--I mean are they--or lasers and those kind of--
Speaker 2: Very, it's very difficult. So, if you go to, if you go to Europe, well, at least Western Europe, you know, Germany, France, England, if you count England as part of Europe, even all up to Scandinavian countries, all of those countries, and all of their labs are just spectacular. And they, you know, they do--you could be here. The same thing is true in Japan.
Story_ID: 24608
Speaker 1: Now, you go to China and things are little bit different. You can go to some places in China where the labs are, are more modest. I'm going in a couple of weeks. I have a colleague there, and I'm gonna go to his lab, and he wants me to give a talk, but then I'm also going to be talking to them about how they can improve their teaching effort. And so I've been to some labs there which were very modest and weren't unlike some of the ones that I've seen in, in Senegal and places. But then I've also seen some labs that are really quite well, well endowed, and they have very nice equipment, especially in, in Shanghai. There's some really spectacular labs there. I was there about, a little over, about, I don't know, eighteen months or so ago. And, and there was a lot of really nice labs there. Now, by and large they, they lack people. And so they're now starting to hire people, even from the outside, non-Chinese to come in to, to help populate their lab and to work. So I've seen a lot of pristine equipment, but underfunded. They don't know quite, they haven't, they haven't really gotten into a position to, to take full advantage of this. And so they're trying to make strides in those directions. So, but now if you go to South America, I was in Brazil last year. And, again, they're very proud of what they have, and it's, it's not, they're--they have a lot more going on in Brazil in the Sao Paulo area and in that state--that's one of the more affluent states. So they have a lot of, of good people, and they're, they're doing a lot of good stuff. And so it's somewhere in between, between what you see in a country that's, that's coming up and what you see here or in Europe. And, but if you go to, if you go to sub-Saharan Africa or even if you go to Northern Africa for that matter, the labs are much more modest. And I've been to a number of those. And they really struggle on equipment. And I've tried to give equipment away to a lab in, in Ghana once. I had an instrument that we were gonna get rid of, that we weren't using it anymore. And so I tried really hard, and I was working with this institute out of Trieste, ITCP, the Institute for Theoretical Physics. And because the director at the time used to be here at Maryland, and then so I knew him. And so I had arranged to try to have, get some money to have this instrument shipped over. But it was so difficult. I mean they wanted it, but they just couldn't get the thing, couldn't get everything together to, to get it. And so they desperately need instrumentation, but then when they get some instrumentation, they're so far away from the vendors that if something were to break, and these things break all the time, it's hard to get it fixed. When I was at Stanford [University], and our laser would break, we'd just put it in the back of the car and drive down the street to Spectra Physics or Coherent, and, you know, say, hey, what's wrong with this thing, fix it. And, you know, that was, you get spoiled that way. But, you know, they, they can't do that. It's very difficult. So, yes, it's very, very hard. So the, the best that we can to do is try to have sort of exchange. And so we have us going there and have some other students come here. Then they get frustrated because they can't, they can't take it, take it back home. So--
Speaker 2: I've heard the same thing is true with black college students, back in the day, not so much now-a-days, I think, but back in the, in the times, if you went to Meharry [Medical College], you'd share a microscope with three other students.
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's, and it's still, I mean you go to labs that, at Morehouse or Atlanta University, and it's different than it is here. I think Florida A and M is one of the exceptions. They have, they have a lot of, they have a lot of equipment and they have a lot, nice lab there. So that's one of the, one of the bright spots.
Speaker 2: Interesting (unclear), you can see Florida State from the campus (laughter).
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, apparently, apparently, that communication is, is strained.
Story_ID: 24609
Speaker 1: Okay. At any rate, so, now, did you go back to the National Institute of Standards during the time you were teaching at University of Maryland?
Speaker 2: I, what I did, I had this, this visiting position. So I was able to go there, as I was setting up my lab here, I was able to go back there and work on things that were already set up, so I could continue to publish papers. And today, I, I interact with Bill Phillips' group--well, we have this thing called the Joint Quantum Institute, which is this new institute that and involves Maryland and NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology] and also the NSA [National Security Agency]. There's a NSA lab, lab for physical science, just off campus here. And so, so we're all part of this same institute, and I'm a fellow in that institute. And so we have collaborators, some of whom are NIST employees and some are Maryland [University of Maryland] employees. And so it's somewhat fluid. And so I, I go out there.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, University of Paris, 1989.
Speaker 2: Yeah, well, that's another visiting position. This was a little longer. This was like a, this was like a month or so. So I was there, and I had a colleague who was, I had worked--I had, I had, was at a meeting. And, and this, this colleague of mine and I were at the same meeting, and I, I, apparently made a comment, "Oh, it would be nice to come spend a little extra time" because she was a theorist. And so I wanted to figure, I wanted to get a chance to, to do some of the calculations, see how these calculations are done. And so she invited me over to, to spend a month there. So it was, it wasn't a sabbatical. But it was sort of a mini-sabbatical. So I was there for, for a month at the institute out in Orsay, [France] which is just outside of Paris. So I lived in the city, but I took the train out every, every day in the morning to, to work. So it was an interesting time to work on my French to improve it a little bit. But it was, that, I came away with a knowledge of how they did their calculations, actually came back with a calculation that helped my student who was working on a problem, helped us to finish off a project that we were trying to do. So, yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I had a visiting position there.
Story_ID: 24610
Speaker 1: Okay, now, let's see, so what, now, so at the University of Maryland, you're doing, you're mainly doing research, not doing very much teaching, right?
Speaker 2: Well, as I mentioned at the beginning, the, the director of the department sort of frowned upon teaching. And in those days, they were sort of separate, this institute--Maryland has lots of different institutes. And, and so this institute was set off to the side. And it was supposed to be sort of a think tank. You come in and you do research, and that was it. Today, that's no longer the case, and so we're always, we're all doing teaching as well as, as research. So in the early days, I didn't, I did some teaching, but it was much limited. I'm doing a whole lot more teaching now than I, than I did then. So that's, that's why you see that 'cause that was the way, that was the way it was.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so when did you kind of, when did things start to really change?
Speaker 2: Well, as I mentioned, I, I sort of negotiated into teaching on my own. So I started talking to the physics department which is where I felt my home is, and so I started teaching one quarter, one, one class a semester, well, one class every other semester. And that was probably by the time, I probably had only been here three years or so when I started doing that. So it wasn't very long. Once I got my lab up and running, then I started trying to teach because I needed the students, and the way to get in touch with students is to teach. So that's, that's how that started.
Story_ID: 24611
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you spent some time also at the University of Colorado, right?
Speaker 2: That was a sabbatical, so, '92' [1992], '93' [1993], I was on sabbatical at the University of Colorado, and actually, there was another institute there called "JILA" [Joint Institute for Astrophysics]. It used to stand for something, but now it no longer does. And it's also a joint institute with NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology], NIST Boulder [Colorado] and the University of Colorado. So I was, I was there for a year, and again, that's where I came away with a lot of new insight there. I, I, it was an interesting time because they had this, what they called a visiting fellows program. And so every year, they would have an order of 10 or so faculty types come in to do sabbatical. And so the time I was there, there were three of us who were on sabbatical, three senior people on sabbatical, and we all worked together on a project and actually managed to do an experiment without any help from any students, which was actually phenomenal. Of course, the students who were in the room, who watched this thought it was kind of funny because we're all used to giving orders, and so we were giving orders as to which screw we were gonna turn first. So that was sort amusing to them. But we actually did an, did an experiment. But I came away with that was starting an effort which I still continue now on cold atoms because I started working with some cold atoms when I was there.
Speaker 1: Now, what is a cold atom?
Speaker 2: What are cold atoms? Well, using laser spectroscopy, in fact, my advisors, Schawlow and Hinch, wrote a paper--this was back in the '70's [1970s] of how you could take a laser to slow an atom down. So atoms that, the atoms are whizzing by at, I don't know, 300 meters per second or so. It depends on their velocity, on the temperature. And if you take an atom, if you take a laser beam, and you focus it on an atom moving in this direction, then it's absorption, the position, the frequency or the color of light that, that it absorbs is shifted. It's so-called Doppler shifted. And so if you tune the frequency of your laser just right, you can make this atom absorb the, absorb the light, and when it absorbs the light, the light carries with it a little momentum. And so the atom slows down. Now, the momentum that the, the light carries--and we call these things photons, is really tiny compared to the momentum of, of the atoms. So it takes thousands and thousands of these things in order to show them down. But you can do that. And so if you can slow these atoms down, and you can actually bring them almost to a stop, and so when we define temperature here, it's sort of an aggregate measure of how much energy is, is in the, is in the air. So these atoms are, we, we put a thermometer out, and so we take the, we say the temperature in the room is, you know, 25 Celsius or, you know, almost 300, 297 Kelvin. So that's a measure of how much energy. And on the Kelvin scale, that's what we now call the absolute scale. So that's the, that's the amount of thermo energy this has. And that's sort of an average, so not all the particles have the same speed, and they all don't have the same energy. But that's sort of the average energy. So, if the atom absorbs the, the light, it eventually will slow down. And you can imagine if you do it in all three dimensions, you can bring this thing almost to a, to a halt. And so, some, some--the realization of this took place in several different labs, one of the labs at, at Bell Labs, Steve Chew, who was there at the time, was able to slow these, this atom, these atoms down by getting six laser beams in all the, the six different directions, and he created what's known as an optical molasses. The atom, the atoms slowed down, but they weren't really trapped. It turns out if you put on magnetic fields, you can write down a set of equations which show that the atoms are now harmonically trapped--remember this harmonic oscillator I talked about, and it's sort of like having these atoms on a spring so that they, they are literally trapped within this, the intersection of all these light beams. And so, you can work out the theory, and you can determine how cold you can make these things. And so they're actually very, very cold. So they're not moving as fast anymore. They're, instead of whizzing around really fast, they're just moving very, very slowly. And so they become very cold. And that's why, that's what we mean by cold, that they have much less energy. And if you, there're bunches of tricks you can play and if you keep playing all these tricks, you can make them extremely cold. And, and so, you go from roughly 300 Kelvin, which is room temperature with these atoms. You can get 'em down into what's known as a milli--micro-Kelvin regime, which is about seven orders of magnitude lower, eight orders of magnitude lower in temperature. And then, you can play some additional tricks to make them even colder still until you can get 'em into a new state of matter, called the Bose-Einstein condense which now you're in, sort of in the nano-Kelvin regimes. So that's really, really low. So this is the, most likely, this is the coldest stuff in the universe. I mean we don't know anything out there that's colder. So this is most likely the coldest stuff that you can, that you can make. And so this stuff all coalesces and it behaves very differently when its, the atoms are very cold, they behave differently than they do when they're, they're warm. When they're warm, they behave like individual atoms. When they're very, very cold, they behave very collectively. And so, there's new manifestations of quantum mechanics that one can study and a whole host of, of new things that one can do. And so, we played sort of a role in, in some of that and did some studies along those lines. So that's what I came away with, from JILA with, how to, how create these, how to make cold atoms.
Story_ID: 24612
Speaker 1: You became a full professor here in '96' [1996], I take it, that's right?
Speaker 2: Sounds about right, yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, so in 1999, you became the director of the laboratory for Atomic Molecular and Optical Science and Engineering.
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a, we had a small lab that no longer exists now. There was, several of us, we got together, and we formed this lab, and this was a way for us to sort of work together. At the time, there was much less atomic, molecular and optic physics on this campus. It's much broader now and much larger than it was then. And so, those of us working in that area tried to form this lab together and so I was, I was, I guess the second director of that. And, but it, it sort of, I mean we had a little group, but then we all started going our separate ways. And so that, that lab no longer exists now. The thing that, it's more along the lines that we were trying to start then is this, this Joint Quantum Institute that, that currently exists. But it was, it was a way to bring the atomic physicists and atomic, molecular, optical physicists together.
Speaker 1: Okay, so, but, okay, Joint Quantum Institute doesn't start till about 2006, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, right, right.
Speaker 1: So, so this, so did this ever last, the atomic molecular optical science lab last for ten years or--
Speaker 2: No, no, no. It, that probably lasted, oh, another three or four years after--probably about three years that we actively worked together. And then we all sort of started going different ways. I mean we put the book together. My, we wrote a book, and so some of us who were in that lab put the book together. We actually, there's a two-volume book. Four of us together wrote these two volumes. So Chi Lee and I--Chi was in electrical engineering. He was part of this lab. He and I wrote the second volume at the time. There's a guy in, in chemistry, John Weiner, who was the first director of this lab. And a guy, another guy in engineering, Ping Tong Ho wrote the first volume. And so this two-volume set came out of that, that laboratory. And they're sort of textbooks designed for first-year graduate students, sort of upper division undergraduates to, on atomic, molecular and optical physics.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, in, was it around 2006 that you initiated the collaboration between University of Maryland and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory? Is that true?
Speaker 2: It was probably before that. I'm trying to think of when we started. Yeah, it may have been the mid-2000s. Yeah, I have a colleague. We used to go to, we, we first met at, at the, one of the annual meetings of the society of, National Society of Black Physicists. And we'd always say, oh, we should do something together. And so we, we did, we, we said these things for a number of years. And then some money became available and so we put in a proposal and got funded. And so I sent a student out to, to work with him. So, yeah, it was in mid-2000s, I guess, that, that came about. And so, yeah, we, collab--I collaborated out there, and the student is still writing his thesis. And so we still sort of have a loose collaboration, and if we find the right student, we'll continue that.
Story_ID: 24613
Speaker 1: Okay, alright, now in 2006, you formed the Joint Quantum Institute, right?
Speaker 2: Well, that was, that was probably started, probably a little later than that, was it, maybe 2006, 2007 that institute was formed. And, and so I was, I'm a fellow in that institute. I mean I, I wasn't the one that formed that. That was, it was formed, well, Bill Phillips who was at the, at, at NIST [National Institute of Standards and Technology], was very instrumental in that. And the physics department was very instrumental in that, so a number of people tried to get together to make something like JILA, the thing in Colorado, here on the, on the, here at Maryland. So it's sort of like, it's sort of like JILA East, and some people call it that. But it's, it's sort of the same flavor. So it's a cooperative between these two entities, the national--so it's a national lab and the university sort of cooperating. And so money comes from both ends of things.
Speaker 1: Okay, now, you started working on--well, your book was published in 2007, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) You're asking me details which we can look up. I don't (laughter)--
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to keep the chronology straight.
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah.
Speaker 1: If it's off a year or so, it doesn't really make a (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, and I don't know the exact time, but, yeah, that sounds, that's close.
Speaker 1: That's about the time. But, well, tell us about the book and your collaboration with Chi Lee.
Speaker 2: Chi Lee.
Speaker 1: Chi Lee.
Speaker 2: Yeah, okay, it comes out of this laboratory, this Lamas laboratory that we had talked about. And so the intent was to develop a set of books or, two volumes, that would help introduce students to this whole idea of atomic, molecular, optical physics or optical science. So it's intended to for physicists, for engineers and for chemists and biologists for that matter, but more of those first three that I mentioned. So the hope is that they can read these books, and they can get a good, basic understanding of how all this works. So, and in my volume I talk about the atom, and how the structure, the structure of the atom. And then I talk about the structure of basically, diatomic molecules. And so those are the basic, fundamental building blocks that we, that we find. And so all of the cold atom things that we do today, needs to have the structure of the atom. And so in the book, I talk about that, I talk about that. And then, and the latest twist here is on cold, cold molecules, how to, how to make molecules very cold. And generally, we're talking about diatomic molecules. So, again, the structure of the diatomic molecule is in there. So it's basically, it's designed for students who have had the quantum mechanics, they understand quantum mechanics. They don't necessarily need to know a lot about lasers, but if they knew a little bit, it would be helpful, and then putting those together. So it's certainly, it's the building blocks that they need in order to go on in this, and to work in this field. The first volume looks at more of model calculations, and it looks at sort of the, the, a single, two-level system, so the fundamental, two-level systems. It looks at things that are the classic things that we, we talk about in, in what's, so-called animal physics, that they, they need to see how to cool an atomic. So they talk the basics of atom cooling that I mentioned before. And then there's a basic thing on the structure of, of the laser. And then the final end of my book, the part that Chi Lee wrote, and he's an engineer, he talks about things of non-linear optics. And so taking what we know about the atoms and the molecules and then you can go into non-linear optics and how you can double the frequency of laser and things of that kind.
Story_ID: 24614
Speaker 1: Dr. Hill, so your research activities can be divided into three areas, I guess, according to what I've read. And one is ultra-fast, atomic and molecular dynamics, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you kind of explain, and--
Speaker 2: Okay, yeah, well, there're three, there're three areas that, the ultra fast, that is looking at things, the dynamics that happen on a very fast time scale. And time scales in which atoms move in molecules and then moving toward--we're not doing this yet, but we'd like to move toward the dynamics in which electrons move around in atoms. So that's one thing. There's, the second thing is the very cold atoms, which we talked about already. And my, my effort there is, is focused on taking these cold atoms and trying to manipulate and, and create something called atomtronics. And atomtronics is sort of a new area where you're trying to mimic electronics with, with neutral atoms. And so we, we were able to do that. In fact, we've created something called, we call a neutral atom capacitor, and so we're trying to, to do a whole effort of trying to understand how we can recreate electronics, but with neutral atoms. And then, the last area is this, this high-intensity work which the collaboration at Livermore [Labs] is part of. And the interest there is on, well, if we increase the intensity of the laser high enough, we get to a regime where our knowledge actually breaks down. We no longer know how to define what's gonna happen. We don't have any models. And to give you a simple example is that, we can talk about a single particle wave function, something called the Dirac equation which is a relativistic equation. I mentioned the relativistic business and this quantum electro dynamics. Well, if you look at the, the dynamics of an electron or an atom, you can, you can write down something called the Dirac equation, and then you get particles and anti-particles from that. At lower intensities, and non-relativistically, one could talk about collective effects. And so when you have a solid, then we have collective effects that take place. There's mini-body physics as it's known. When we get to, up to the really intense regime where we're looking at, not only quantum effects, but also relativistic affects, then we have a problem when we start to talking about collective effects. And so we, we start to get into a regime where we don't really know how to write any equations down to discover, to describe what might happen. Now, we don't know what's gonna happen, and, and, of course, that's why it's call the frontier because if we knew what's on the other side, it wouldn't be a frontier. So, we're trying to get to a regime where the intensities of the lasers are high enough that we just get into a brand new area, and we don't know what's going to happen. And so that's what makes it kind of exciting. And so what, this high-intensity field works into that. Now, these are regimes where, that govern what happens in, in stars, and so, and the stars are extremely hot and extremely dense. And so interesting things take place. We know some, some about it, but we don't know everything about it. So we're, we're trying to get to a regime where that's happening. There's a lot of effort around the world, and I emphasize "around the world" in making larger and larger and more and more intense lasers. The United States is lagging behind that a little bit--a lot actually. Europe and Asia are both spending lots of money developing new lasers to get to these new regimes. And the United States is not participating to a very high degree in that. And so that's a little bit troubling that we might get left behind in terms of some of these fundamental science areas. But that's, that's the third area that, that I'm looking at.
Speaker 1: Who's leading (unclear) (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Europe and, and Asia. Europe right now is leading it, just like they're doing in high-energy experimental physics because a lot of the high-energy experimental physics is all down in Europe now.
Speaker 1: Because of the CERN (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yeah, the CERN (unclear). So, and it's a little bit troubling that the U.S. is not investing enough in some of these areas, and, and that's what's kept us in the lead all along is our scientific investment in these new areas. And so it's a little, personal concern that that's not happening. And, and people aren't coming to the U.S. They're going to Europe, and so that's, that's a problem. That's something that we need to look at.
Speaker 1: I heard of some politician discussing in Congress about the, if you build a Collider, there'd be a black hole and suck the whole thing in it.
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, well, there's, there's a lot of, lot of things that if you don't understand what's going on, you have all these, these fears. But, you know, yeah, that's what they thought was gonna happen at CERN, but nothing like that has happened.
Story_ID: 24615
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So those are the three, three areas that I, I work in. Now, the ultra-fast dynamics here, basically, what the interests there is on, I mentioned, we'd like to go to a regime where we can sort of freeze out or take a snapshot of what happens when the electron moves around the atom. If you get too, if you, if you get to an ability where you can make a pulse fast enough that you can start to do this, then you ought, you ought to get to a regime where, again, our knowledge of how to, how to describe what's going to happen will start to break down. And that's always, that's one of the things that drives us as scientists, is to get to the edge of our knowledge and see if you can push beyond that because that's where the frontier is, where the models as we have them, we know that at some stage these models break down. And so we'd like to always get to that regime where things break down because then we don't know what's gonna happen. And then the whole thing, everything is wide open. And that's when new discoveries come, when you get to these kind of regimes or in the process of getting there, sometimes, new discoveries come because you have to develop something new. What I am interested in at the moment is taking these, what I call ultra-fast lasers and along with the lasers being ultra-fast, that means you have a light pulse that is, turns on and turns off very, very fast on the order of, well, we have a, a unit of tens of what's known as a Femtosecond, a Femto is 10 to the negative 15. So that's, that's a one with 15 zeroes behind it, but it's in the denominator. So that's really, really short. Now, in order to make a light pulse that short, it has to be composed of many, many colors. And so the spectrum is very, very broad because they're inversely related. And so when you have this very broad spectrum, now, you can do interesting things. And what we do is something called "Shape our Pulse", and we can shape it--there's lots of different ways you can shape it spaciously or you can shape it in the frequency spectrum, and you can shape it in--there's another unit which is a little bit mysterious. And so it's a little harder to explain, something called a phase. Now, the best way to think of phase is, you know, you have a, a sign wave that you remember from your, your high school math, a sign wave, and you have a co-sign wave. Well, a sign wave and a co-sign wave are, are sort of shifted. So you can see where the sign wave crosses the origin at zero, where the co-sign wave has its peak at zero. Well, you can imagine, if you shift that peak over, then it's gonna cross at the same point. So if you shift that along, you can make a sign wave look like a co-sign wave. And so that phase actually plays a role in lots of stuff. And so we're interested in, in understanding just how phase, which is again, a little mysterious, and the same thing happens when you talk about matter. The matter as it evolves in time, takes a phase with it. Ordinarily, you can't see it. You can't measure it. It's hard. So you have to do something that allows you to project that phase out on something that's real, that you can see because it's often described by something called imaginary numbers. An imaginary number is, is the scrod of a negative one. So that becomes an imaginary number because it's not real. So you don't see this. Our instruments aren't sensitive to that. Our eyes aren't sensitive to that. But, if you do things just right, you can make these imaginary parts interfere with each other and then project out into real space, something that we can see. And so that's what we try to do, and we try to use this to, to be able to control dynamics, that ordinarily wouldn't occur with these very fast laser pulses. So we control the phase, and, and we can, we can make a system evolve along a certain path. And so we can pre-determine a path that the system can evolve along, and then we can produce a shaped laser pulse to, to produce that. Now, the problem is, you can produce the pulse, but it turns out, it's very difficult to understand exactly how it's working. And so our biggest effort is in trying to break it down into parts to understand precisely how this works. And the reason we wanna do that is because eventually, you're going to want to use this technique to manufacture something in particular. And one of the efforts of, of interest is something called quantum computing. Computers today are made out of, are based on classical algorithm. There's a big effort to try to do a quantum algorithm which would be, if one could make it work, would be enormously faster and would be able to predict and model systems as they exists in real life on, on real time. A classical computer, it cannot handle the, some of the detail. It's just too many calculations and it's too slow. But a quantum computer, on the other hand, takes advantage of the fact a system can appear to be in two places at once. It can be doing two different things at the same time. So taking that into event and taking that into account would enable you to do a calculation much faster. And what, you have to create these systems, and you have to create these particular states, and the states turn out to be extremely fragile. One way to create them is to take these pulses, and so we're working on ways to understand how to take the pulses well enough that eventually one day, way down the line, you might be able to use it to create a particular quantum state that would be useful for doing quantum computing.

Speaker 1: How's the reception to your book been? I mean is it used in classrooms--
Speaker 2: Oh, my book? Well, it's interesting. I, I don't know how many people use it. I mean it came from notes from classes that I've taught here. But wherever I go people seem to know that I've written this book, and I, they ask for signatures and so that's, that's sort of enlightening. I still get a check periodically from the publisher, from royalties. So, so I guess somebody's buying it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would suppose it'd be purchased by classroom students, I mean students--
Speaker 2: You're welcome to purchase one if you like (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter). I'd have to be prepped as to how to use it. I'd need a couple of graduate school to get to--
Speaker 2: Oh, you can read it. I try to be straightforward there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Problems may be a little challenging.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm sure, I know they would be. But, now, tell us about your students now. Now, what--you're teaching more here, and you've got students. Do you have graduate students--
Speaker 2: I have some graduate students, and I have undergraduate students. I, I should point out, I'm, I'm just getting back to the university. I spent two years at the National Science Foundation as, what's known as a rotator. I was running the atomic molecular and optical physics program there. So I was, I was basically, handing out money to, to my, to my colleagues. And so, so I've been gone for two years, and I'm just coming back, just this fall. And so now, I'm teaching lab courses, so I have lots of students. And I interface with them right now through, through TA's primarily. I also have graduate student and undergraduates working in my lab and post-docs. So I have two post-docs, two, three graduate students at the moment and one undergraduate who are, who are working with me at, in these various experiments that I'm doing right now. So, yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright.
Story_ID: 24617
Speaker 1: Have you been involved in any efforts to try to increase the number of black graduate students here?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, nationally, actually, not, not just here. I mean I've done some recruiting runs to various places to, to come here. It's very challenging to get into Maryland. It's, it's one of the better--well, you'll have to take this with a grain of salt 'cause I'm here, but it's better programs in the country. I, I don't know, there's some ranking. It's, you know, certainly within the 20, top 15 in some cases, near the top 10 in other. It depends on who you, who you listen to. But we have a very challenging and very competitive program. We got some very good students to come here. My concern is that for a number of years, well, actually from its origin here in the U.S., the United States has basically only depended upon a fraction of its population for physics. And this propagates through the other sciences. Chemistry is a little bit better, biology's a lot better. But physics and math and electrical engineering, in particular, have been very underrepresented in, in its diversity. And partly because physics, physics is a bit of hostile environment. The thing that, physicist tend to be, try to really get to the heart of issues and our discussions can be very strong. They can be very opinionated, but if you don't understand how that works, you could, you could feel that some of these comments that, that somebody might say, that oh, that's makes--that's nonsense. You take that personally, where they're not really, they're not meant to be personal. They're meant to be that, well, your assessment is probably wrong or I don't agree with your assessment. And so, it, it's almost a sink or swim environment in many physics departments. They have not been very friendly. That is being, that's changing. I mean the same thing was true for women, and women were not really appreciated and encouraged to go into physics. That whole attitude is changing. Now, in, in terms of the underrepresented groups which are basically African Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans, there is an effort to, to increase those numbers. Again, because we've only depended upon a fraction of our, our strength here in this country, we, we're in a new, we're in a new era, where we need to depend on, on more because it's not too long before these so-called minority populations will be, will make up the majority of, of the U.S. And that's coming down the pipe fairly, fairly soon. So if we don't make this physics more inclusive and encourage more people to come in it, we have several problems. One, we're gonna run out of brainpower, and two, which is equally as important, is that these people who will not be part of the, the effort will be the decision makers, and if they don't take stock in this, and they don't have a stake in, in what's, in the enterprise, the physics enterprise, well, the funding flow is gonna get turned off. And it's not gonna happen. That would be bad for the country 'cause it's really the science which is really promoted, science and education has promoted the U.S. to its current position. And we, we need to maintain that. So, there's a self-preservation there that we need to, to make sure that we open the door and, and encourage other people to come in. Now, there's a lot of talent. There's a lot of, lot of intellectual talent which is not being used that we'd like to capture. And one of the efforts I'm involved with is with one of our societies called the American Physical Society which is trying to put together a program to encourage students. A number of our students, African Americans, in particular, and Hispanics in particular, are going to these schools which are not part of the usual top 10 or the research intensive institutions, come from a different environment. And so when they come to a place like a Maryland or a Stanford or some place, they can feel really intimidated because they don't understand the culture. And, and so we're looking for ways in which to help these students, not just to survive but really to thrive in these, in the environments which makes physics what it is because it's this semi-cut throat back and forth, which allows ideas to really become refined and move forward. But that's the same thing that makes people that aren't used to it very uncomfortable. So, we're, we have an effort to try to help, help bridge that gap and help identify really smart people to get them into the pipeline and help them see the, how, how great it is to be a physicist. I mean life as a physicist is great. I mean I, you know, I wake up in the morning and look forward to going to work. Not everybody can say that. You know, we, I have colleagues all over the world. I get a chance to visit places and see things and play in the lab. And I get paid for it on top of that. And so it's, it's really a lot of, a lot of fun. It's a lot of work, a lot of pressure, but it's also a lot of fun. So, and that's the, that's the message we're trying to get across to people.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 24618
Speaker 1: What are some of your hopes and concerns for the African American community today?
Speaker 2: Well, along the lines of the science, is to become part of that mainstream, not, not to be--to be a stakeholder and to become part of the effort. I want to see more of us in this research effort, at, you know, at the research institutions, at Maryland. Maryland [University of Maryland] has been one of the places that has a large number of African American professors, and probably one of the largest, if not "the" largest in, in the country. So it has done a really fine job of, of that. But, now, and there're a couple of people in physics, but I'd like to see more than just a couple. You know, I'd like to see several people in several positions in, in many of the top research institutions. So I'd like to encourage our, some of the smartest kids to go into physics because it's a, you know, it takes a lot of work. It's, it's hard work, but I'd like to see that happen. It's very important for, for that to happen in, in my opinion. So I'd like to do what I can to encourage people to keep the door open to encourage them to come in. And so I, I have students that I work with from time to time. I have high school students that come into my lab in, in the summer. And I've had students who have worked with me over the years, and I try to help to encourage them.
Story_ID: 24619
Speaker 1: Now, when you look back at everything you've done to this point, is there anything major that you would redo or do over again or change?
Speaker 2: Well, I don't, I don't know. It's hard to say. There's, there's--I've certainly made mistakes. One of the, what I decided to do when I left graduate school was that my family was going to be a priority, and I wouldn't change that. My family's always been a priority which meant necessarily that some of my colleagues will go beyond where I'm gonna go because I'm not, I'm not going to spend all my time that's required to, to do that. I have friends who have now Nobel Prizes, and, and some of those friends are, no longer have their families because they were wedded to what they've done. I don't regret that. I don't regret not having a Nobel Prize or not having worked hard enough to have earned one because I spent time with my family. My family is important. So that's certainly not a regret. There probably have been some opportunities that I didn't avail myself to, which I probably should have. I know that there are some research directions that I had thought of that I probably should have pursued which turned out to be really important, that somebody else eventually did, that I didn't do. So I sometimes regret that I didn't get them done, that I had, I had the idea beforehand. But, you know, that's, that happens. So, it's a little hard to say. I, I--one thing that I probably would have liked to have done is spent more time on the West Coast than I, than I spend now. And so we're trying to, to do that 'cause I really miss California. I, I fear, I have to go back periodically to, to do what I call get recalibrated because life in the East and the life West aren't the same. And so I, I miss that. If I could pick up College Park [Maryland] and move it to somewhere in California, I would do that.
Speaker 1: What's the main difference between the two?
Speaker 2: Well, if you put the, there's weather obviously. There's terrain. I miss the mountains, and I miss the ocean. There's sort of, there's an ocean but it's not quite the same. There aren't any, what I call real mountains around, close by. So I, I miss, I miss getting to the real mountains above the tree line and things of that, a place where you can see snow all year and such. So I, I miss that activity. I miss the beauty, the spectacular beauty of things. And believe it or not, I actually miss freeways. I miss freeways. I miss not being able to take five different freeways to go someplace. I, I just--I grew up on the freeways so I actually miss that. And I miss family, so there're family, family there.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: But I find that I, I do work, and I'm gone so much that, you know, I, it doesn't really--I wouldn't be able to take full advantage of things. But there are times, you know, the end of the day, that on a, you know, Friday evening, if I were to go home early, I would hop in my car and go down to the beach to watch the sun set. I miss that.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think that's probably the thing I miss the most.
Story_ID: 24620
Speaker 1: Well, tell us about your family here. We didn't, I know you have daughters--
Speaker 2: Okay, my wife and I have just celebrated thirty three years of marriage. I think I mentioned that we got married on my parents' anniversary. It was supposed to be a week later, but we had trouble getting the church and the reception area at the same time. So we got married in Berkley [California]. So we have three daughters. My oldest daughter is now a graduate student, will be starting in Northwestern [University] in a week or so in biomedical engineering. My second daughter is here at College Park [Maryland], who is doing international relations and, with sort of an emphasis on global poverty. So I get to see her all the time, and my youngest daughter is still in high school. She's a junior in high school. My, my second daughter is a junior here. So she's, you know, halfway done. So we're very, very close. We spend lots of time together. My wife has had several incarnations. She was a, a journalist after going to "J" school at Columbia [University]. She was a lawyer. She went to the Catholic University, and they had a program in sort of law with a bend toward communications or communications law. So she worked with a, you know, high-powered law firm for a while but found that that wasn't meeting, that wasn't her personality. And so now she's an entrepreneur. She has her own business, and she's gotten into health foods and health food supplements and things of that kind.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: She's very close to her parents. Her father died some time ago, so both of our fathers are, are gone. But our mothers are still here. In fact, she's with her mother right now trying to help her. She's, has some issues she's going through so we try to get out to help her as much as possible. She's, she still lives in the Bay area. She's got one sister. Just last weekend, her sister and her husband have one daughter who's at Temple University. We were up visiting her last weekend. So the families try to, to meet. My brother has two children. One is, his oldest, his older one is, runs track, and didn't quite make the Olympic team this year. So, but she's coaching and, and trying to start businesses. And her, her, his second child is just graduated from San Francisco State and loves San Francisco [California] and has decided to stay there. I'm not exactly sure what he's doing these days, but he's, he's just graduated. So.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So we get together every now and then. We try to, my brother and I try to get together, once a year or so at least or whenever I'm out I stop in to see him.

Speaker 1: When you look back at everything you've done to this point, what today would you consider to be your legacy?
Speaker 2: Well, my children (laughter), and my students. I hope that my students can carry out and, and do work and go beyond what I've done. I always, my parents always tried to prepare us to be able to go beyond where they were. I hope we've done the same thing to prepare our children to go beyond where we've gotten. And I try to get my students to be prepared so they can go on as well. So I hope I'm known to be a solid scientist, a genuine person, one that has a love for people, a love for, for Jesus, and those two working together. I mean I'm very involved with my, my church. And I'm glad to say my children are involved with various, various ministries as well. My oldest daughter was very involved with, I guess inner varsity when she was at Stanford, and is trying to figure out what she's gonna be doing when she's at Northwestern. My youngest daughter, my middle daughter here is with Campus Crusade. And so she just spent the entire summer at, in New Hampshire, living with some, some folks that were ministering to people and witnessing to people. So that was good. So it was, it's, that's very satisfying to see that my, my children are taking that, that baton and moving out in that direction. So, I, I'd like my, the people that I've encountered to be real people, that they enjoy what they do. They can know how to have fun and know how to treat people properly, and encourage people, even people who are competitors. And so my youngest daughter shows that a lot. She runs cross country, and she, even though she's not the best on the team, she's always encouraging people and, and when somebody's hurt, she stops and helps them. But she encourages people who are even, who are doing better than she is. And she's good friends with them. So that's, that's really heartwarming. But in terms of the science, you know, I'd like to, to be known as a solid scientist. I would still like to be able to do a couple of things that have real meaning in terms of advancing the field to, to a new level. So I don't feel like I'm done yet with the science. So I still, there's still a couple of things we'd like to, to do. This whole atomtronics thing, I'd like make sure, I'd like to get that to a level where it may actually do something useful and carry on and, and be something special. So, so I guess the legacy is to be a complete person, and, of course, you can define that any way you want, and I define that as being able to care for people, having, having a faith in how, what we're here to do, actually do, and to be able to do your job well.

Speaker 1: Sir, how would you like to be remembered?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, it's very similar to the legacy question. Well, I'd like to be remembered as, I guess being honest, giving a hundred percent, treating people properly, being fair, and I, I, and being able to think through issues clearly, I guess. And I really, what's really important to me is that my children like to spend time with me, that they appreciate the counsel that I give them, that they recognize that I won't tell 'em what to do, and that I will have them--they have to make their own decision. We've tried to train them to respect themselves and, and I guess I wanna be remembered as having done a hundred percent, you know. In the bible, there's, Jesus tells a story, a parable of the talents, and we've all been given talents. And we're expected to use those talents, and those talents come in various forms. And, of course, if you--"To whom much is given, much is expected", and so I wanna be remembered as using my talents wisely, and I have, I have a lot of talents that, that I've been entrusted with. And I want to be remembered as having, having invested those talents and not putting 'em under a pillow somewhere.

Speaker 1: Well, this is my mother's mother, and I don't know--this is when, this is, ghee, I don't know when this was. It was after my grandfather had died, so it's probably in the late '90s [1990s].
Speaker 2: Okay, what's her name?
Speaker 1: This is Rosa Washington, Rosa Caldwell Washington.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: This is me, and I think I'm about 13 or 14 months old here.
Speaker 2: And that's in, that's in California.
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in Los Angeles.
Speaker 2: This is me. This is Christmas day, and I think this was a Christmas present. I don't, I think this is in the Bay area. We often went up North for Christmas. This, and I was, again, about 15 months old.
Speaker 1: That's my first birthday.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: I don't know what that, that's, I was thinking. I was in graduate school then.
Speaker 2: That's a good time to think (laughter).
Speaker 1: (Laughter) This was my graduation at, from Stanford. On the left is my mother, then my thesis advisor, Arthur Schawlow, and then me and then my father.
Speaker 2: You should probably just name your father too.
Speaker 1: It's the same as my name, Wendell Hill, Jr.
Speaker 2: Yeah, there's gonna be somebody typing up the caption and hearing your voice--
Speaker 1: I understand, okay.
Speaker 2: --they're not here. They don't.
Speaker 1: Yes, I understand. And that's me in my thesis talk with a shirt that you had to put ear plugs on.
Speaker 2: Again, this is after my thesis, and so that's Ted Hinch who was at Stanford at the time. This was part of the Hinch-Schawlow group, or Schawlow-Hinch group. Then it's my wife, Patricia, me and then Arthur Schawlow, my advisor.
Speaker 1: I don't know when this is. This is at the beach. I probably was a little over a year old, and obviously, I'm in, being held by my father, and then that's my mother as well.
Speaker 2: Okay, this is me and a truck. We're on our way to sabbatical with two of my daughters. The one to the left is Nayo, N-A-Y-O, and then my younger daughter at the time, Eshe, E-S-H-E. Eshe is the one who's now a student here, and then me.
Speaker 1: And there's my same two daughters. The taller one is Nayo, and then the younger, smaller--the other one is Eshe. And this was in Boulder [Colorado].
Speaker 2: And this is my oldest daughter, Nayo, off to school for the first time in Boulder.
Speaker 1: And this is Eshe and I was, I don't know, doing something.
Speaker 2: And these were the three of us. This was on my fortieth birthday in Boulder. They were helping me celebrate my birthday. Nayo is the one in front and Eshe, then me.
Speaker 1: This was at, for my father, and I don't remember if this was his retirement or this was sort of an honor, something to honor him. And I was giving a little talk, and we coincidentally had similar suits on.
Speaker 2: These are my parents. My father was very much of a bicyclist, and they came to visit us. This is where we lived in Boulder. So, my mother on the left and then my father getting ready to go off on my bicycle.
Speaker 1: And this is me and my wife at her graduation from law school, at Columbia University.
Speaker 2: And this is the whole family and me, my youngest daughter who I'm carrying was not very old here. I don't, I think this was in Easter. I'm not sure exactly where we were, so it's my wife, then my oldest daughter in front of her, then me and my youngest daughter who is Safiya, S-A-F-I-Y-A, and then Eshe is standing to my left.
Speaker 1: Did you ever give your wife's name?
Speaker 2: Patricia, Patricia Anita Thompson Hill.
Speaker 1: And these are my mother's parents, and this is just before my grandfather died. So this was some time in the mid--mid-to-late '80's [1980s].
Speaker 2: This is a memorial to my grandfather at Jarvis. As you can see there, this was his, he was the second president.
Speaker 1: And this is my grandfather, my mother's father, Peter C. Washington.
Speaker 2: This is my father's mother, Mildred Washington, and then my grandfather died, so she got remarried to Rivers, and this was just before she died. She lived to be a hundred, a hundred and one actually.
Speaker 1: And this is my grandfather, my father's father who was Wendell, Sr.
Speaker 2: Yeah, this is a family reunion. We have these family reunions every two years. This is at the "Wye Plantation, and this is the house--well, this is the house that stand, which supposedly is near the location where the original owner's house was. And this is one of our family reunions. I think it's 2004 if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: This was a picture taken in my lab at, at Stanford during my graduate days. This was, this was taken because it was being considered for a cover on, on a magazine, but it didn't really make it. But, so these were from my experiment. Also, it's dated.
Speaker 2: Okay, now, this is my, this is my team. This is during my senior year. This is the varsity baseball team. That's me up to bat (laughter), coming up to bat. This is our home field, by the way.
Speaker 1: This is me playing down here--this is catching. I was playing, looks like I was playing short stop that time or third, I can't remember. And I was up here just sort of looking cool. I was (laughter)--one of the editors of the, of the yearbook said she put that in there 'cause she thought it looked cool.
Speaker 2: And that's my senior picture if you can zoom in on my statement there, that's my picture. This is where I said I, Orange County, surviving it was my greatest achievement.
