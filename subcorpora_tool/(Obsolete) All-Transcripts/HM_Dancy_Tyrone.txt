Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, oh yeah--
Speaker 1: Okay.

Speaker 2: Well prior to retirement--I'm in a retirement state now, but prior to retirement, I was a veteran services representative with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and that was started by President Carter, Jimmy Carter.  He thought it would be a great idea for the Vietnam veterans, those that were being injured, to come out and counsel and be available to advise and receive other veterans coming back out to society and to work with them and so he opened up many opportunities for Vietnam veterans that were injured to get a job to help others.  And so I started out with that and over the years, it moved into a--still the operation but more expanded, where I became the supervisor of a department and dealing with the veterans in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Speaker 1: So you said it was the Carter era of (unclear).  About what year did you start with the Commonwealth?

Story_ID: 33230
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I'm gonna ask about your family history.  I'm gonna ask about your mother's side of the family and your father's side but we'll start with your mother's side.  Can you give us your mother's full name and spell it for us please?
Speaker 2: It is Elaine Strayhorn.
Speaker 1: Okay, can you spell that for us?
Speaker 2: Both names or just--
Speaker 1: Both.

Speaker 1: Okay and what is her date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I do not recall.
Speaker 1: Now you were born in 1947.  Do you know about how old your mother was when you were born?
Speaker 2: I believe she was in her late 20's.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So maybe 1920 or there-about?  1918, 1920?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: We'll just say (unclear) 1920.  And where was your mother born?
Speaker 2: In Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  What side of Philadelphia was she born or (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--West Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: West Philadelphia, okay.  Now what can you tell us about your mother's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what were they--were there any stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: No, but I know they originated from North Carolina, and I can only go back to my grandparents, which was Lillian Strayhorn and John Strayhorn.
Speaker 1: Did your grandparents live in North Carolina?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's Lillian and John Strayhorn.  Now is there a story about how they came to Philadelphia or what brought 'em to Philadelphia?
Speaker 2: If there is, I do not know it.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Did they leave North Carolina when they were kids or when they were grown, do you know?
Speaker 2: When they were grown--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 33231
Speaker 1: Did they have any family land in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I believe he left after finishing his tour in the, in the Army.
Speaker 1: So this would be the Second World War?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  World War II then, huhh?  Okay.  So what did your grandfather [John Strayhorn] do for a living?
Speaker 2: At that time, after he came up here [Philadelphia], he worked in construction.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And did your grandmother [Lillian Strayhorn] work?
Speaker 2: No, she was a housewife.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  So your mother [Elaine Strayhorn] was raised in West Philadelphia.  Do you know where she went to high school?
Speaker 2: Overbrook [High School].
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  And--now did your mother have any stories about growing up that she shared with you about what it was like when she was coming along?
Speaker 2: I--none stands out, no.
Speaker 1: Okay.  I mean--now, I mean some obvious things would be, you know, would be useful like, you know, who was at Overbrook with her and maybe who (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well maybe it would make a difference that she did have sisters and brothers.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, and they're Dorothy, and then there's Richard Strayhorn, and Norman Strayhorn and Benjamin Strayhorn--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so their story would center around the--coming up with siblings and the difficulty they had, what they had to go through, and the sharing and the need to get some--get work and be active in school, so yeah, stories like that.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So there's nothing specifically you remember that they went through that you can talk about?
Speaker 2: Her first job--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --as a seamstress with Botany 500, and she had (unclear) long work, difficult work, and low pay; almost like what's happening today in many instances.
Speaker 1: Botany 500 makes suits and ties and (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, right.  So during that time when I was coming up, I was a well-dressed little young man.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did your mother aspire to go to college or anything?
Speaker 2: No, never discussed that, no, no; never discussed that with me.
Speaker 1: Did anybody else in the family go, or did they--
Speaker 2: Yeah, my Uncle Norman, yes; he was in school, and Richard Strayhorn.  In fact, I think it was business school for Richard Strayhorn--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --my uncle.
Story_ID: 33232
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, okay.  Well, let me go to your father's side.  Can you give us your father's full name and spell it for us?
Speaker 2: Oh, Leon, L-E-O-N T., Turner Dancy, D-A-N-C-Y.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And what is his date of birth and place of birth?
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: Okay, was he older than your mother?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I'd say by a year, couple of years.
Speaker 1: Okay, so he's around the same, around 19, 18, 1920 or something like that?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And where was your father born?
Speaker 2: Say that again?
Speaker 1: Where was your father born?
Speaker 2: He was born here in Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And on the west side of Philly too?
Speaker 2: Correct, that's right.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now what can you tell us about your father's side of the family?  How far back can you trace them and what are the stories about what they were doing?
Speaker 2: As far as back, I can go back to my grandmother--his mother, and on that side and his brother George; he had a gas station and my father would--spent a career in the Navy.
Speaker 1: Now did he go to Overbrook [High School] too?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did--what was your grandmother's name, I'm sorry, I didn't get her name.
Speaker 2: Oh, Lillian.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay.  The same as your mother's [Elaine Strayhorn] name?  Mother's-
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm sorry--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --you're talking about my father's mother?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: My fa--Marian.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, I thought, I thought I might be (laughter)--.  So Marian Dancy, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's your grandmother, all right.  And so so did your grandmother raise your father by herself or--
Speaker 2: No, she didn't--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --no, she didn't; but I never got to know who my grandfather was on my father's side.
Speaker 1: So did he pass before you were born?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  And how many siblings did your father have?
Speaker 2: Oh, he had one brother, George.
Speaker 1: Okay, and that's the brother that owned a gas station--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --which is an interesting, you know, story, 'cause that's, quite a thing to own a gas station.
Speaker 2: That's right, quite an accomplishment.  And it was in West Philadelphia--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and in fact, it was around 52nd Street.
Story_ID: 33233
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And your father [Leon Turner Dancy], you know--now did your father finish high school?
Speaker 2: Yes, he did--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes, he did.
Speaker 1: And then he joined the Navy?
Speaker 2: Right.  And he made a career out of it.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So he served in World War II in the Navy then, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: (Inaudible question)
Speaker 2: Yes, okay.  I was thinking more--Korea.
Speaker 1: Really?  Well, if he was born in 1918 or '20' [1920], it's probably both, you know.  I mean--well, if he served his whole career, it was probably both (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, okay.
Speaker 1: If he started after high school, he most certainly would have gone to World War II or, you know, whether he served here or overseas, but the Korean--if he was in it his whole career, you would have gone through Korea and probably maybe even part of Vietnam, I don't know.
Speaker 2: Yeah.  Quite a story how rough it was for blacks in the Navy, or any of the military.
Speaker 1: Well, I've heard the Navy is particularly rough, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --tell me--what did your father say about the Navy?
Speaker 2: Constant discrimination, how duties were rough for the blacks whose given the laborious duties, dangerous duties, and he had to--oh, he had difficulty many times speaking up 'cause he certainly didn't want to submit to the unfairness but he was able to hang in there and I gotta give him credit for him to continue to make it all through and make it a career, that's quite an accomplishment.  I later found out through my experience in the military; no simple matter, no simple matter.  Assignments can change and you can be subject to be kicked out at any time--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so the mere fact that he was able to avoid that, that's quite an accomplishment.
Speaker 1: Right, it's something.  Now he, like a lot of other black servicemen at that time, talked about the discrimination and how tough it was, but he decided to make a career out of it.  So did he--so I guess he--how long did he serve?
Speaker 2: He served twenty years.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when did he retire?
Speaker 2: I believe it was around the '50's [1950's].
Speaker 1: In the '50's [1950's]?
Speaker 2: I think; I don't know for sure, but that's a--
Speaker 1: Would you say the late '50's [1950's]?  If he was in 20 years, he could go in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--you think it was the early '60's [1960's]?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm thinking maybe because World War II starts in '41' [1941], and he if he was--he would have finished high school around, you know, 1939 or '40' [1940], I guess.  So if he was in the Navy from say 1940, 20 years, he would have come out in 1960.
Speaker 2: Alright, that's better, yeah, that makes sense--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So he probably served through the '50's [1950's] and came out around '60' [1960].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: This would have been right on the cusp of the Vietnam War 'cause the Vietnam War really didn't really kick into gear until the '60's [1960's], the mid-60's [1060's], even though it's going on but it's not, you know, really publicized.
Speaker 2: Precisely.  Yeah, yeah.
Speaker 1: So your father came in as just a raw recruit, I take it?  Since he didn't go to college, he didn't--he came in as just a seaman, right?
Speaker 2: Oh yes, right; wasn't an officer--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --he was a non-commissioned officer which is--oh, what did they call them?  The seamen--rank of a--
Speaker 1: It would be the equivalent of a sergeant, I guess (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Precisely, right; which would be like a six or a seven (simultaneous)--A E-6 or 7.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.
Speaker 2: I believe he retired as a E-7.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, did your father serve?  I would guess he would have had a chance to go overseas, right?
Speaker 2: Oh, definitely, yeah; more-so out at sea, on the sea, on the different ships.
Story_ID: 33234
Speaker 1: Was he [Leon Turner Dancy]--did he get married before he joined the Navy or while he was in the Navy?
Speaker 2: After.
Speaker 1: After.  Okay, so he got married after, I mean after 1960 or so?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  Okay.  So--wait a minute, now he and your mother are not married as you were saying.
Speaker 2: (NODDING OF HIS HEAD YES).
Speaker 1: Okay.  So I'm trying to get this--all right.
Speaker 2: Right, got you.
Speaker 1: So I got that part, okay.  So--but he--you were born in '47' [1947] so he was in the Navy when you and your mother left, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, that's correct.
Speaker 1: So tell us, what is the story?  How did your parents meet?
Speaker 2: My mother [Elaine Strayhorn] had a cold; she went to the pharmacy, which was right at the corner of her house, and that's where she met my dad in his Navy uniform--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and they started dating and started a relationship and that's how it went.
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is after World War II I guess, right?  Was this just before you were born or just about a year or two or what?  What would you think?
Speaker 2: I don't vividly--I do not vividly recall.
Speaker 1: Well I don't know you would--I didn't think that you would recall (laughter), but they don't talk about when they actually--I mean your mother (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, oh, oh,--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--they actually got together?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But were they together for a period of time, or was it kind of like a, you know, he went back in the Navy after they got together?
Speaker 2: Right, he was home on leave--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --alright, and they used to--I believe it lasted two weeks and he went away and they stayed in touch, and every time he would come home, they would see one another and that's it--yes, right.
Story_ID: 33235
Speaker 1: So--now did your father [Leon Turner Dancy] play a major role in your life?  Even though your parents didn't get married, did he play a major role?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So he was, you know, on assignment with the Navy someplace in the--
Speaker 2: Right.  Yeah, absentee father.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  But he did--did he surface at, you know, different times?  I mean did he (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh yeah, he wasn't absolutely not available, yes, but he wasn't there on a, on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis.
Speaker 1: Okay, but you saw him throughout your life (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Precisely.
Speaker 1: --at key points.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now, from what you know about him, and I know you know much more probably about your mother [Elaine Strayhorn] since she raised you and she was always around, but--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --when you consider their personalities, their talents, their gifts, their hobbies and how they walk, talk, looked, you know, their opinions, who do you think you take after the most?
Speaker 2: Leon.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, and why?  Why do you say that?
Speaker 2: According to what my mother says and what I heard about his way with words, and I have a fascination with words and putting words together in phrases, and poetic, yes, and that's exactly what he was.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, do you look like your father?
Speaker 2: Yes, I'm told (laughter).
Speaker 1: All right, okay.  Now, do you have brothers and sisters?
Speaker 2: Yes, I do.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I have--first (unclear) I have Keith, that's Keith Strayhorn; and then, since my mother--father died and she re-married so the siblings, my brother's last name, not Dancy but Allen; there's Wayne Allen--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --Eric Allen, Glenn Allen, and Theresa (ph.) Allen.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So when you were growing up, your household consisted basically of--was it you and your mother and our brothers and sisters or did any grandparents stay with you or--
Speaker 2: No, grandparents [Lillian and John Strayhorn] was not on the scene; they had passed.  Now when she re-married, it was me and Keith, and what developed from that was the brothers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and sister.
Story_ID: 33236
Speaker 1: So about how old were you when your mother [Elaine Strayhorn] re-married?
Speaker 2: West Philadelphia.
Speaker 1: No, I said about how old were you when your other re-married?
Speaker 2: Oh, around 16 or 15; 15.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Okay, so you were basically out of the house when your little brothers and sisters--and sister came up, you know.  You were getting ready to leave or you didn't have too much longer to live at home, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Ahh, right, right.  That experience--I had a wonderful experience with the brothers and sis; they played a major role in me developing a maturity because I was their babysitter and at first, believe it and not, I never really resented it.  For some reason, I played--easily adapted to the fact of, of an older sibling, older brother that was able to oversee the care of my brothers and sisters; they played a central role in me being introduced to responsibility and did well.  And I have to say, later on, the results--they have been a wonderful group of people in my life as far as brothers and sisters.
Speaker 1: Well tell us about 'em, you know.  Now where do you fit in?  Are you older than Keith or is Keith--
Speaker 2: Yes.  In fact, I'm older than all that I just named.
Speaker 1: So first comes you in '47' [1947], then Keith is born in--about what year?  About what year is Keith born?
Speaker 2: I don't follow you.
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying what year was Keith born?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) They never--I do have the information (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Is he like a couple of years younger than you or five years younger than you or how long?  What do you think?
Speaker 2: I, I, I would get back if--if you will hold off, I will get back to you on all of those dates--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --when we go into our break room and come back--
Speaker 1: All right, all right.
Speaker 2: --but I--yeah, I find that important to address--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so I won't forget to do that, and I look forward to addressing the (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Alright?  'Cause I wanna do justice to that question.
Speaker 1: Well, you know, you can approximate, you know, if you don't know exactly how many years your brother is younger than you, but you just, you know--was he like a couple grades behind you or what?  Or three, four?
Speaker 2: Let's see; I would say seven years difference--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Five to seven years difference.
Speaker 1: That's considerable difference; so your early years you spent as an only child.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, that makes a difference in your story.  Do you have an earliest childhood memory?
Speaker 2: Oh--and what do you mean by that?
Speaker 1: First thing that you remember in life (laughter), that you know you remember--that's the earliest childhood memory.
Speaker 2: My favorite wagon (laughter)--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: (Laughter)--but, but no, give me an example.  What do you mean by that?
Speaker 1: Well that might be it, but we're gonna pause here and then we'll talk about it.
Story_ID: 33237
Speaker 1: All right.  You were saying that your red wagon was your earliest childhood memory but in the interim, you had some birthdates, right?  About your siblings (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Right, got to the dates.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Now you asked (ph.) to be about the age of Keith; now, he was born in November--I mean September 26, 1954--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that's Keith--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --approximately (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That's seven years, as you were saying; that's seven years older--I mean younger than you.  And the other ones?
Speaker 2: Now Eric was born in July 12th, 1960--'60' [1960], and we have Wayne, Wayne Allen; he was born in 1958.  So I thought the only relevant and important--but the dates be--uhh, Wayne's '59' [1959]; he was born in 1959--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and the range of Taress--Theresa--she was born in 1961 and, and, and Glenn I do not have his date down here but I believe Glenn was born in 19--1960--1962, a year later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So that's overall.
Speaker 1: Okay.  But you basically were the big brother to (unclear) Keith, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: By all means, you were the big brother to your--for him, and you were the oldest male in the household too, right?
Speaker 2: That's right.
Speaker 1: So when you talk about response--setting the trend and being responsible and that sort of thing, you had to set the tone for him.
Speaker 2: That's right, and I never found that to be a burden or a problem.  As I reflect upon that, that is, that is quite unusual.
Speaker 1: Now can you describe where you--did you move a lot or were you in the same space (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Stable.
Speaker 1: Stable, okay.
Story_ID: 33238
Speaker 1: But where did you grow up?
Speaker 2: A combination of West Philadelphia, North Philadelphia and finally Germantown.
Speaker 1: Okay; but those are three different places (laughter).  All right, so in West Philly, North Philly and Germantown.  Well, we always ask this question like this and you can combine all these places, just let us know what's going on where, but what were some of the sights and sounds and smells of growing up?
Speaker 2: West Philadelphia was the initial place that, that consisted of my early part of, of the world, of learning about the world, and I would say it was fairly safe and stable.  Only when you got into your teens and times changed did the gang element come into play in the part of West Philadelphia.  West Minister--I was considered part of the West Minister Gang and West Philadelphia, but really never participated in any sort of gang wars itself; was on a peripheral of that, was really not required to do any sort of fighting (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--territorial gang or territorial kind of association?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  And that became consistent, and more so when I moved to--when we moved to North Philadelphia at 23rd and Diamond.  We taught (ph.) about high rise projects and we're talking about a concentrated group of people in a sort of low income environment.
Speaker 1: What was the name of the projects?
Speaker 2: Raymond Rosen [Homes].
Speaker 1: Okay.  Raymond Rosen, R-O-S-E-N?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay.  (Simultaneous)--How old were you?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Diamond Street, 23rd and Diamond.
Speaker 1: Okay, that's 23rd and Diamond and how old were you when you moved there?
Speaker 2: I believe around 16--15, 16.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  This was about 1963, I guess, right?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes.  Time range correct.
Story_ID: 33239
Speaker 1: All right.  Well, continue (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So it was a--that's when I learned about really an intense and increased gang activity.  They were shooting and then there was the element of drugs which I didn't learn about in West Philadelphia; I was neither a participant, a user, nor a transferor of such things.  Once again I'm on a peripheral level of that and by me living there, it was assumed by those guys in other areas that I was part of what they considered the Valley; you're part of the Valley.  The Valley consisted--they consid--the definition would be you have three high rise buildings in this large complex structure, and in the middle would be mostly where the gang wars would take place, almost like a coliseum and a Roman--a Roman coliseum where you would battle and duel and that sort of thing.  No, I was not caught up in that, I was a spectator, seeing it happen.
Speaker 1: How did you stay out of that?
Speaker 2: One, by not participating.  But now, you would say "Well how come you wasn't drawed in it or compelled?"  All I can say it was a blessing (laughter); it was never compelled for me to participate by no one.  No one sit back and say "You--when we fight, we wanna see you out there."  It wasn't that sorta thing because I was not part of a gang.  Well they didn't know my name, I was just living in that type of environment that I did not participate in.  But, I was subject for injury because I was in that type of environment.
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know a lot of people (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So I, I would get (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--compelled to join anyway.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I would get challenged as far as early in the morning getting ready to go to school, [Thomas] Fitzsimons [Junior High School], 26th and Cumberland; gangs would stop me, but I was fortunate or blessed enough to get out of that because they neither took me as a target so they neither--they did not do harm to me, they just questioned me as far as where I was from, and so that's how it went.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Do you think it's because you didn't get there until you were sixteen [years old] that they really didn't recruit you?  You think you were too old or--
Speaker 2: No, I never gave it thought and I don't know why, you know, how that developed.  But I didn't--I think the key thing--I didn't hang out, I didn't loiter, I didn't do that type of things; I avoided it.  It didn't appeal to me.
Story_ID: 33240
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, I was asking you in terms of sights and sounds and smells.
Speaker 2: West Philadelphia was always music playing in the background and then North Philly, it was Motown; along with Motown, there was shouts of gangs and roughling (ph.) and noise of running through the streets, gun fire, that type of thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now you mentioned Germantown too.
Speaker 2: Germantown was really the point of Motown.  Germantown is where I started out becoming part of the talent show at Germantown High.  Germantown was more so a socialization type of a thing.  The party, being around in--my, my, my, my focus at that time was to be part of a singing group; that didn't necessarily happen so I did a solo (laughter), a brief solo career.
Speaker 1: Now did you start singing in the church, or did you just start (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, it--we--it centered on singing in the talent shows, and my thing--I was a--I considered myself a balladeer and I was--considered myself on the level of a Nat King Cole, Johnny Mathis, that sorta thing.
Speaker 1: Now you have a mellow voice and the deeper range; I don't know what it was like when you were younger, but did you have a deep voice in those days?
Speaker 2: No, not when I was singing in Germantown, no, no, I wouldn't consider it deep; it only came that way as I got older.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you sang like in the Nat King Cole fashion in those kinda--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.  Now that would have been (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Johnny Mathis.
Speaker 1: It's interesting, but that would have been--during that era, that would have been considered maybe a little old timey in some ways, I mean around your peers I'm sure 'cause they would consider Nat King Cole older kinda guy that would appeal to your parents more than say the--your peers, you know; I mean I don't know, I mean is that true?  Is that pretty much true?
Speaker 2: Well no, not at that time because it was only, it was only during the talent, the talent show that I was that kinda balladeer; after that, it was like what the Miracles, the Four Tops, the Temptations, that sorta thing.  No, my--I wasn't really restricted only to singing ballads.
Speaker 1: Okay, no, I was just saying that that kind of singing was more the music of your parents' generation than--so Nat King Cole was very popular.  Now when you were a little kid, what was your first school?
Speaker 2: George [L.] Brooks [School], 57th and Haverford (ph.) Avenue.
Story_ID: 33241
Speaker 1: Okay, George [L.] Brooks School.  Now did you like school growing up?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you have a favorite teacher or subject or activity at school?
Speaker 2: Ah, yes.  It was Mrs. Brooks; that was my favorite teacher; and then the vice principal; I liked him because of his--believe it or not, his disciplinarian manner; I found it (laughter)--for some reason, I just found it humorous.  He was so authoritive (ph.) (laughter); never give you a break, you had to be on the straight and narrow.  So it was that introduction--later I found out it was that sorta military bearing he had.
Speaker 1: Now what was his name?  Do you remember?
Speaker 2: Mr. Farland.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now these teachers--white or black or what?
Speaker 2: Black.
Speaker 1: Black, okay.  And--so I would take it most of your school was black in those days (unclear)--
Speaker 2: Yes--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --except for--naw, that's--no, we, we're talking about the George Brooks School, correct?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that is right that it was an all-black school basically, right?
Speaker 2: (NODDING HIS HEAD YES).
Speaker 1: And that's West Philadelphia and--so you were at George Brooks from--did you go to Kindergarten?
Speaker 2: I don't recall.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I don't recall.
Speaker 1: But you were there through about what grade?
Speaker 2: I, I believe it's first grade; first grade through, through six.
Speaker 1: Oh, so you were there first grade though six and then the family moved and you went to another--a school in North Philly, right?
Speaker 2: No, no, it was still West Philadelphia; I went on to, I went on to Shoemaker--
Speaker 1: That's S (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--but that was for one semes--that was for one grade though, seventh.
Speaker 1: Is that S-H-O or S-H-U?
Speaker 2: Shoemaker?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: S-H-O-E--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --M-A-K-E-R.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Junior High.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you were there for one grade?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Before the seventh?
Speaker 2: So, so the eighth grade started at [Thomas] Fitzsimon[s] [Junior High School]--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --26th and Cumberland.
Speaker 1: That's called Fitz Simon?  That's called what now?
Speaker 2: Fitz, F-I-T-Z-S-I-M-O-N.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, they--usually I'm a visual person; I would really have to write those words down but I think I'm doin' pretty good (laughter).
Speaker 1: You are, you're doing fine, just fine.  So now at Shoemaker Junior High School--
Speaker 2: That was a turning point in my life--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --because that is where I learned the skills of fighting; it was not about learning anything (laughter), that's when I first--they had class wars.  Not the gang where they have class wars within the school, so you had one section, one boy--all boys' class I was in, fighting another all boys' class.  I know it sounds ridiculous; it's embarrassing but that's what was happening down there, and so it wasn't too much learning going on during that time at Fitzsimon, it was just a matter of honing your skills, not--trying to not get beat up and that sorta thing.
Speaker 1: Now were there any males?  Now you mentioned the principal, Mr. Farland over at George Brooks, but were there any males in your life that were like a mentor to you or, you know, that you looked up to when you were growing up to kinda teach you how to be a man in the world?
Speaker 2: Unfortunately, none comes to mind.  It's interesting, I know I'm quite ahead of myself; that really doesn't happen until my first basic training--my introduction to the service.
Story_ID: 33242
Speaker 1: So when you were growing up, I take it your family needed--did you have to work growing up?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yes, I did have a part-time job, yeah.
Speaker 1: So what did you do?
Speaker 2: My part-time job was actually taking that--later on that wagon, and taking groceries home from the store.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  I figured you might have had a (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--And then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--something (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Not yet, and then graduating and working in a store.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so how old were you when you got a job in a store?
Speaker 2: How old?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: Oh, around 12, 13.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And were you bagging groceries and that sorta thing?
Speaker 2: Precisely; cleaning the shelves, stocking the shelves.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So--now were you involved growing up in any organized activities like the Y, the Boys' Club or the Boy Scouts or anything?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Really?  Nothing?
Speaker 2: I wanted to--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --but the opportunity didn't present itself.  Boys--the Boy Scouts.
Speaker 1: Okay.  There wasn't a troop around you that you knew of that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, all right.  Did you know any boy scouts (unclear)?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did; yes, I did.
Speaker 1: were these guys that lived in other neighborhoods (unclear), or--
Speaker 2: Right, I do remember Stanley, yeah.  But it didn't pan out for me.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So--now when you went to [Thomas] Fitzsimon[s] [Junior High School]--now that's on the North Side, this was when you were living in the Raymond Rosen Homes, right?
Speaker 2: Precisely, that's right.
Speaker 1: All right.  Did the majority of the students come from Raymond Rosen?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I wouldn't say that but they came from the surrounding areas, right in the neighborhood; they wasn't bussed in, they were within the neighborhood.
Speaker 1: Okay, now had that been a Jewish community previously or something?  Because the names seem all Jewish, you know, and Rosen and Simon and, you know--
Speaker 2: I don't know the history about that, no.  I'm not sure.
Speaker 1: Okay, I'm just asking 'cause they seem like Jewish names.  So junior high school, anything significant at junior high school in terms of--did you like--I guess--now you write and you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--You know what?  I spoke too soon--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --during--there was a German teacher, and--no, no, I'm mixing that up.  No, I take that back, no.  I don't find out about him until I get to Germantown.  Now at Fitzsimon, Fitzsimon, they had a--they had a medal shop, they had little medal shops, the sorta construction trade there, they seemed to be grooming you for the industry and, and I was able to learn the--some parts of the medal trade, the wood trade, that sorta thing, and bits and pieces of that type of education did come in handy later on; bits and pieces, but it wasn't really--contribute necessarily for a job preparation and what--the culture there mostly, they had, they had an opportunity to put out like who was--who never missed time in school, who was late, who was never late, and who was the best dressed and at that time, I was elected as the best dressed for a particular class or that grade level, and yes, I was very conscientious about the dress and the way the clothes look and how you look at that time.
Story_ID: 33243
Speaker 1: Because I know your mother [Elaine Strayhorn] worked for Botany 500, right?
Speaker 2: (Laughter)Yeah, and she would be groomed because--right, right.  And was--in fact, whenever we would go downtown here in Philadelphia, on a Saturday--in fact, it went through a period of time where I had on a dress--that the clothes I had on that morning would not be the same clothes I would have on in the evening or later on in the evening; the change of clothes, and when I went downtown or whenever I went out, the dress--I'll be dressed as if I was going for a photograph, that sorta thing.
Speaker 1: Okay, so you had the suit and tie and everything?
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Yeah, right.  So over time, I was very conscientious on what I would wear.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now how were your grades in those days?  Were you making good grades in school?
Speaker 2: I'd say at that time at Fitzsimon, it was, it was passing grades--not failure, passing, but neither were they academic level.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were at Fitzsimon for the eighth and ninth grade, right?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: I was Fitzsimon all the way 'til you graduated.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that was junior high through high school?
Speaker 2: It would be, it would--let's see, junior high--it would be seven through nine, I believe, and then Germantown was 10, 11, 12, if I'm not mistaken.
Speaker 1: Okay, so Germantown, 10th--okay.
Story_ID: 33244
Speaker 1: Now, Germantown High School, is that very far from where you lived?
Speaker 2: No; at that time?  No, not at all.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're talking about a radius of three blocks.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, all right.  So something--right around the corner.  Okay, so you're like--this is 1965, I guess?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Sixty-four, '65' [1965], something like that?  Okay; mid-'60's [1960's].  Now--so were you gravitating towards any particular subject in school?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Are there any significant teachers as far as you're concerned in terms of--
Speaker 2: Yes, that's right; now we come to the German.  Mr.--I cannot recall his name, but it was an English class and we were learning vocabulary and that's when I start gravitating, falling in love with the powers of words; usage, what they meant, the significance of words, how your thought processes--your thinking is based upon the words that, that you're able to utter, to express yourself, how you think, what you're thinking with; it was through that class I was introduced to that, and how it laid the foundation for all the other learning that came about, and for the introduction; and it was through Germantown that I start establishing the love for learning, how important the learning was.  Even through, through academically, it wasn't displayed but still (laughter), still I did admire and cherish the opportunity of learning and going to school.  And Germantown and all that happened during that time period from going into Germantown and graduating were indeed the best years of my teenage life.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Now did you--were you--did you have any favorite reading material in those days?  Did you read a lot as a teenager during that phase when you were excited about words?
Speaker 2: No, believe it--yes--I did not read a lot, and sometimes I joke and say it's a miracle that I know how to read (laughter) because I did not read to the degree that I should, but when I did reading, the intensity of reading, once again, follows into the military; it come about through there.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So your English teacher, did he have you basically reading poetry or what?
Speaker 2: Oh, alright, one book stands out; it's called the--'The Good Earth'.  It was a book in which was required for a report but it was so descriptive it stands out so far--I do not remember the author, but I do (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Pearl S. Buck, yeah (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Pearl S. Buck, yeah.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: It's a classic--considered a classic book now by everybody so--so you read this in high school and that really--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was part of that English course and the vocabulary and the reading.  It was through the English teacher, (unclear) I was going the singing in the--it's called the Spring--I cannot recall--Spring event, some sorta talent show which I was in and he complimented about that I was singing a Johnny Mathis style and he (laughter), he complimented about--he told the class "See that?  I could understand every word Tyrone was singing."
Speaker 1: So your teacher made a point to teach the students to pronounce the words correctly and distinctly?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Laughter) Simultaneous)--"I could understand every word Tyrone was singing."  I looked upon that as a compliment (laughter); alright.
Story_ID: 33245
Speaker 1: All right, so you're singing like Johnny Mathis and Nat King Cole in the talent show.  Now did your singing attract the young ladies?
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, yeah.  Unique (laughter).
Speaker 1: Was that encouragement to continue singing?  (Laughter).
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Now, I get the picture now that you're the best dressed man in the school--young man in the school, in Botany 500 suits, and you're singing like Nat King Cole and Johnny Mathis, and young ladies are coming, you know, so--
Speaker 2: The picture is just a little different.
Speaker 1: Is it?  Okay.
Speaker 2: Right.  Here it is.  Remember, I was the best dressed at [Thomas] Fitzsimon[s] [Junior High School]; it doesn't necessarily mean it lingered on to Germantown, although I wasn't no slouch at Germantown, but the competition was quite intense in Germantown.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: We have a whole new culture there.
Speaker 1: But certainly the best dressed man at Fitzsimon could at least get (simultaneous)--he's in the running.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, I was passable, quite passable.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, all right.  So--these are the best years of high school (laughter) I can see right now.  So--now did you keep up with current events in those days?  Did you, I mean did you know what was going on in the world?  'Cause at that point, Vietnam had started up and had been kind of, in some discussions (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, that's, that's interesting, that was so--that was a background along with what Martin Luther King was goin'--what was goin' on in the south and back, but the domination was what's goin' on at Motown and the next record comin' out, and the latest style or what to wear in shoes.  So it was a peripheral thing; you know it was goin' on, but it's like worlds away until you're drafted.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, just before I get you out of high school, now did you--were you involved in any other kind of activities in high school like clubs or--I don't know; you said you did--you're not a spectator of sports, but did you play any sports?  You're a fairly good-sized man, you know.  I don't know, like I guess you were at least tall in those days, right?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was invited to play football and, and that didn't appeal to me, and I was rotten at playing basketball; the ball never went through the net, I don't know what's wrong with that.  I couldn't understand it (laughter), I was never good at that.
Speaker 1: Now what about baseball?
Speaker 2: Baseball, that didn't appeal to me.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Did you run track or anything like that?
Speaker 2: But what did 'peal to me was--oh yes, race--yes, I was a track--I did run track, but also appeal to me weightlifting, but I didn't become competitive in that or intense in weightlifting 'til years later.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  So in high school then you sang and were you in a chorus or anything in school or the choir?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was just the talent show activity?
Speaker 2: Oh, but I failed to remember, I also had a part-time job--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --yes, I did have a part-time job in the latter--in fact two years--latter later years, part-time--shoe, I was working in a shoe store.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  Well what kind of shoe store was it?  Was it general shoes for everybody or men's shoes or--
Speaker 2: Right, it was, it was from children--men, women and children.
Speaker 1: So general shoe company.
Speaker 2: Right, yeah.
Speaker 1: All right.  Was it in the neighborhood or--
Speaker 2: Yes, it was, right on Shelton Avenue; near Shelton and Germantown Avenue.
Story_ID: 33246
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now was church a big part of growing up at all?  I know we mentioned it earlier, but--
Speaker 2: Ahh, go back, it was during my time in North Philadelphia that I spent a year or two in New Thankful Baptist at 18th and Columbia Avenue--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --and that's where I sang on the choir.
Speaker 1: So church was not a big part of growing up then, I take it, since you were like a member for two years at this one church?
Speaker 2: (Unclear)--But those time--I have to (unclear), those times in the church were the best years, one of the best--absolutely best year of teenage life, being in the church.
Speaker 1: And why?  For what reason?  Why?  Can you explain why?
Speaker 2: For one reason, I had a introduction to a higher power--God, and the relationship to my life and the world around you, and your responsibility as a human being on this earth as a child of God and what to do with your life, and how to dedicate your life.  So there I learned an intense understanding of the respect of humankind and our behavior, our responsibility, and the best way to conduct your life and how not to be a destructive force in this world.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now, you mentioned like--that Dr. King was something that you knew about and I guess--well you lived through--you were a kid when John F. Kennedy was assassinated in '63' [1963]--
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: --march on Washington that same year, Sixteenth Street Baptist Church being blown up, all those items were in the news in '63' [1963], '64' [1964] all the Civil Rights activities down south and the, you know, the riots starting in '66' [1966], I guess; that's about after you graduated though.  But what--were you impressed with Dr. King or--were you impressed with Dr. King?
Speaker 2: Absolutely.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Fascinating man, and brilliant--brilliant man.  And I could not understand--when he was speaking out against Vietnam, how--the backlash he received was very, very inappropriate as far as I'm concerned.  And at that time, I didn't realize it, I'm speaking in the Af--what I found out later, but he was right on time.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  But at the time, you weren't aware of the current events (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, no, I had complete--right.
Story_ID: 33247
Speaker 1: Okay, now you said--so when you graduated from high school, what were your prospects?  What did you do?  Were you still working in the shoe store?  Did you get another job?
Speaker 2: Oh, oh, no.  What happened after that, I got a opportunity to go to vocational school, John F. Kennedy Vocational School under a program called [Comprehensive Employment and Training Act] CETA.
Speaker 1: Now this is 19 what, 60--your high school graduation is when?
Speaker 2: We're talking about 19--this is year--this is--no, I didn't get a chance to vocational school until around 1967, '68' [1968].
Speaker 1: Okay, so did graduate from high school in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh yes, yes (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Sixty-five?  Yeah.  Okay, all right.  So John F. Kennedy comes around in 1967, '68' [1968], the vocational school, and what did you think you would (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I took up machine trade; it was called a milling machine operator.
Speaker 1: Now is this--a milling machine has something to do with the textile industry?  Is that what--
Speaker 2: No, that was in the metal, metal trade.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right, okay.  So were there any special teachers there at John F. Kennedy?
Speaker 2: No, none stand out, but the attendance and the trade itself enabled me to get--it legitimately took you--after you finished, you were able to go out into the industry and work at it, and which I did.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I was working in the industrial industry when I was notified of my draft.
Speaker 1: Where you working?
Speaker 2: I was working at the Wright, W-R-I-G-H-T, Wright Metal Trade.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you had been there--well did you work there at least a year or--
Speaker 2: Just about.
Speaker 1: Just about, huhh?
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.  Well, let's see (CALCULATING), '68' [1968], '68' [1968].  You're right because, let's see, in January--yeah, less than a year because in (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--You were drafted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--January of '69' [1969] I was required to report to 901 Broad Street.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they give you a--when you're drafted like that, do you have an option of what branch you can serve in, or did they just tell you when you're drafted?
Speaker 2: Option?  I don't remember option, I know I was just to report and I was to start in the army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you start immediately, or how long did they give you?
Speaker 2: No, the letter said "Come with your small overnight bag because you won't be returning home."
Speaker 1: Okay.  So when you were there in January, you knew you were gone.  So where did you go for basic training?
Speaker 2: Fort Bragg, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now did you--I should have asked this before I asked this question, but did you have any trepidation about being drafted?  Now this is the Vietnam era; you're not necessarily paying that much attention to the news but Vietnam was really cooking then; I mean you have the Tet Offensive in the Winter of '68' [1968], and it was really getting hot in Vietnam.  Had you met any Vietnam vets--
Speaker 2: No--
Speaker 1: --or people by this time?  Nobody in your neighborhood (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--but you're right about the trepidation; I felt very uncomfortable, and the reality is I knew I was bein' drafted to be part of the manpower for Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did you--I mean you were drafted; how did you feel about it?  Did you think 'well, how can I get outta this'? or did you just say "Well, whatever happens, I'll just have to deal with it," or what?
Speaker 2: I did, I did feel apprehensive and yes, my mother worked on trying to get me relieved from that responsibility.
Speaker 1: Now on what basis did she--
Speaker 2: By me being the older child.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So you were still living with your mother then, at that point?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So she tried to get you relieved of duty because you were the oldest child and working in the home?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And you had so many younger, you know--okay.
Story_ID: 33248
Speaker 1: Okay, so this is January, 1969 and you're drafted; you're at Fort Bragg, that's North Carolina, right?
Speaker 2: (NODDING HIS HEAD YES).
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.  All right, so what was basic training like?
Speaker 2: Right, it was during the time of Pigs?  No, I make it all the way through basic training.  My mother's intervention didn't come 'til I was in Anniston, Alabama, at Fort McClellan; that was the transfer place.  Once you left advance infantry training, then jungle preparation escape (ph.) and evasion, that most likely we're goin' to Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: It was at that point that the Congressional Letter came in and the officer spoke to me--the captain of the unit saying "We got notification that your mother don't want you to go to Vietnam but there's nothing that can prevent you from serving as it is."  So they just told me the information probably as a courtesy, but it didn't change my likelihood of going to Vietnam.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you knew when you were being trained because of the nature of the training you were receiving--
Speaker 2: Especially--you're right, at the Advance Infantry, after graduation from basic training in North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So it was pretty clear to everybody in your group that they knew they were going to Vietnam.
Speaker 2: (NODDING HIS HEAD YES).
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So this is--basic training lasts what is it ninety days or--how long does basic training last?
Speaker 2: Basic training--I believe it was eight to nine weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Yeah, so it's not quite ninety days but two and a-half months, I guess.  And then you went to Aniston to Fort McClellan [?]--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Right; this was for advance training, and what they were advancing you to do--I mean the kind of training they were giving you was the indication of where you were gonna serve, right?
Speaker 2: For combat.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  Now did you have a special job that you were trained for, I mean other than, you know, being a soldier, an infantry (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, exactly; that was the Emma West Infantry, title Rifleman; that you will be part of a combat operation.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay, so there was no electronic training, no radio training, no, you know, training for the special task of any--other than that?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  So when were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--You are familiarized of all the weaponry you would need for that field operation.
Speaker 1: Okay, and what weaponry was it other than the rifle itself?  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--There is the grenade launcher and there is the, the N-50 caliber machine gun, and of course the M-16.
Speaker 1: That's the rifle you used, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, the M-16.
Speaker 2: And then there's the small arms weapon, a .45, and I did mention grenade launcher?
Speaker 1: Yeah, the grenade launcher, the M-16, .45 caliber (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Machine gun M-50.
Speaker 1: Oh, M-50 machine gun, okay.
Speaker 2: In fact, that was the weapon I carried in Vietnam, M-50.
Speaker 1: All right.  How much did that weigh?
Speaker 2: I believe 50--50, 45 pounds.
Speaker 1: Okay, so the weapon you--everybody was trained to use the same kinds of weapons but you basically were assigned the M-50?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right.  And so all this training took place at Fort McClellan.  How long was the training at Fort McClellan?
Speaker 2: Now I--that, that seemed to be two months.
Story_ID: 33249
Speaker 1: Okay.  So we're getting in towards May now of '69' [1969], right?  May or June of '69' [1969]?
Speaker 2: Because--and you're right about the time frame because it is in June that I report to Vietnam; June, 1969.
Speaker 1: Okay.  This is like late June or early June, or--
Speaker 2: Early June.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: We're talking about a second week in June.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So did they--did you fly over to Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Yes, I did.  Flew out of Washington--state of Washington.
Speaker 1: Was that pretty much the standard route, I guess out to Vietnam in those days?  They fly you from the West Coast, right, I guess, to Vietnam?
Speaker 2: Now I'm not sure about that, but I know I went out from the state of Washington.
Speaker 1: Well I know it makes sense to go across the Pacific I guess to get to Vietnam, so I would guess that would be the way but--okay.
Speaker 2: And it was a big plane and I believe it was eight rows of 747?  It could have been another plane but that comes to mind.
Speaker 1: Like a airliner?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, it was a private airline.
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.  So it was a private airline like United or American or one of those kinda carriers?  Was it a military plane?
Speaker 2: No, it wasn't.  It was a commercial line and I believe it was American.
Speaker 1: Now I wouldn't imagined that; I have no idea how people got there, but I wouldn't imagine it would have been a commercial airplane but do you think that that was strategic, you know, to send the people over--to send troops over on a--in civilian planes?
Speaker 2: I didn't give it much thought; even to today I don't given it (laughter) much thought.
Speaker 1: So did you fly into Japan first, or Taiwan or someplace and then over to Vietnam, or did you fly directly to Vietnam?
Speaker 2: I do--had to be a transfer, but I do not recall that transfer.  I believe the trans--well, I only remember taking to--landing in Cam Ranh Bay [Vietnam].
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then taken by a military plane to Long Bend.
Speaker 1: Okay, now Cam Ranh is spelled C-A-M R-H-A-N? (sic)
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Cam Ranh Bay, Long Binh [Vietnam].  It's funny, these names from Vietnam--now I've never served over there, but you heard 'em in the news so much, you saw 'em in print that you knew 'em, you know.  That's the only way I can explain it and how I know how to spell it.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes.  The heat was oppressive when the doors opened; I do remember that.  It literally is hard to breathe, getting off at Cam Ranh Bay.
Speaker 1: Okay.  A little hotter than down south here?
Speaker 2: My body--I have never known heat like that in my entire adult life.  That was the first time my body--that I went into a heat rash, and that was a miserable feeling.
Story_ID: 33250
Speaker 1: Okay, so your base was at Long Binh [Vietnam], right?  And that's L-O-N-G and B-I-N-H?
Speaker 2: (NODDING HIS HEAD YES).
Speaker 1: And so what was Long--it was hot, now we know that--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --but how many soldiers were there?
Speaker 2: That was a processing center; that was your introduction to get you assigned to a unit processing; administration, getting adapted to the environment, and then actually the assignment to your unit; then you would be flown out with the other individuals that's assigned to either near where you're going or assigned to the unit you're going to.  And of course my being the 199th Infantry Brigade--Long Binh.
Speaker 1: So you're assigned the 199th Infantry Brigade and--okay, so do you remember who your leaders were?
Speaker 2: No.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well, continue; you know this story now better than I can ever enhance (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--So, we're being flown into Long Binh and night falls; we're coming in--I believe the early evening, and we began to receive fire, or weapontry fire from the ground towards the plane we're on and the pilots say we cannot land, we're under attack, we have to circle until the incoming fire is subdued, and we're gonna circle and stay above ground as long as we can, as long as we have fuel.  So that had us circle, and circle until that fire was contained--the gunfire at the plane.  So we finally landed in the Long Binh area and we got out and got assembled and assigned to our units, and then we had a meal, whatever the meal was; I was not very hungry so I didn't eat.  And so the next day we began training to get ourselves acclimated to the hot conditions in which we were in.  So we began running, we began practicing fire, we began dealing with land mines--how to dismantle, disable a land mine, how to detect land mines, how to use effectively hand grenades, and once again running, learning to breathe properly, then going through training about who we're dealing with, what's guerrilla warfare, being enlisted to join possibly other units that would be a squad such as a three-man team, how to act as a listening post, to go out where the enemy is but don't be detected, and how to move without being detected, and all those guerrilla war factors.  And finally, after the training, comes the day of my first mission.
Speaker 1: How long was the training?
Speaker 2: Well, let's see, it--two weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Through all that getting in the culture of Vietnam, two weeks.
Speaker 1: Okay.  We're gonna pause (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--It coulda been, it coulda--yeah, within two weeks I--it coulda been as close as the second week.
Story_ID: 33251
Speaker 1: (INTERVIEW CONTINUED WITH THE INTERVIEWEE CONTINUING HIS DESCRIPTION, AS FOLLOWS):
Speaker 2: So the morning of the mission, helicopter came and we assembled to get on the helicopter, my first time on a helicopter; the doors open, and we started off.  My apprehension was falling out of the helicopter, especially when it turned and--held on tightly, and I don't remember they telling me that but (laughter) maybe they did, and it was very scenic; it was--I notice how beautiful the landscape appear, but the danger lurked beneath all that tree line, and if they got sight of you on the air, they would shoot you out of the air so danger was always present.  So we come into they consider the hot LZ (ph.) where your vehicle coming in and it being fired upon.  I later found out we were flying into what is considered the Province of My Lai--with Calley.
Speaker 1: Okay, well they call it My Lai Province; this is where the My Lai Massacre took place.
Speaker 2: Exactly.  So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Had that occurred yet?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, had that occurred before you got there, or was that something that was going to happen later?
Speaker 2: That had already occurred, if my memory serve--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --that had already happened.
Speaker 1: Okay, so that had been a hot area in the war for a long time.
Speaker 2: So, bullets was ripping, whizzing overhead near me; I was asked to clear the door and I thought they were going to go down closer to the ground but I had to exit and I wasn't exiting fast enough, so I was pushed out of the door and when I went, I fell a distance--well, actually jumped a distance, and that's where I injured my back but at the time, it was not as dominant on my attention because of the bullets whizzing over the head and running to a tree line that seemed a half-mile away; it's an exaggeration but it seemed so far under the frightful conditions.
Speaker 1: Hmm.
Speaker 2: So, you get to the tree line and no one was hit during that entry; so the first night, my first night in the jungle, absolutely dark.  Darkness--darkest I ever seen; blackest--couldn't see your hand in front of you.  So we made it through the night.  The following morning, we were flown in as a treat I guess, breakfast.  Day two, wandering through the jungle--I mean not wandering but marching through the jungle and we had contact with the Vietnamese; they fired upon us, we fired back and, once again, we didn't get any casualties; no one hit; that was day two.  Day three, we started out in another direction.  The mission was search and destroy.  We went through heavy terrain.
Speaker 1: Now what does that--what does that mean, search and destroy?  I mean for those who are watching this and don't know what you're--
Speaker 2: Search and destroy--what is our search?  Search out the enemy; once you find the enemy, destroy, eliminate.
Story_ID: 33252
Speaker 1: Now was it difficult, I mean I know you were only there a few days, but how did you know which Vietnamese were the Vietcong and which ones were not?
Speaker 2: I, I'm sorry, repeat that?
Speaker 1: How could you know which one was the enemy, I guess?  I mean I know those shooting at you were probably (laughter), but otherwise could you tell one Vietnamese from another?
Speaker 2: That's a very keen point, especially--it's easy when you're out in the jungle; it's a whole different thing when you go into a village but, here again, fortunately, I did not have to go into any villages; it all happened in the jungle itself, so it made it pretty easy to find out who exactly was the enemy, and you brought up a very good point; it's not very good--I mean not very easy for the guys that goes into the village; you really don't know until you're being fired upon, and it might be too late.  We go into the thick terrain--heavy jungle where you have to cut your way through; we come out, and I describe in my book as if you're standing in the Fairmount Park in Philadelphia where the clearing--where it's clear and there's tree lines around you in a distance.  It is at this point that snipers fire upon us and literally chaos breaks out.  Soldiers--earlier, I was replaced because I was walking flank.  You have a body of the patrol, and you have a man on the adjacent side of the body, and you have point and you have rear guard.  Now I was not doing very good as a flank because I was new and I did not have ability to keep myself aligned with the group because they were afraid I wandered off and be by myself (laughter), so they brought me in, they said "No, no, don't leave Dancy out in the (unclear)" and an experienced person took my place.  When we hit the clearing, the fellow which I do not recall his name who took my place received the--the bullet from the sniper who hit him in the head and eliminated the flank, and they start shooting at those around, the captain got hit, a number of individuals were hit, and we were pinned down; we couldn't move, and when anyone did move, he was shot--they were shot.  So it left me and a guy from New Orleans [Louisiana] to be asked to go up and bring back the wounded, at least out of the range of fire, and that's when I took off the main gear to go out and bring back the wounded--what we thought was wounded; but when we got there, one was dead and they were not to be brought back unless in a body bag; they were not alive.  And in the interim, me going out to bring back the wounded, In was injured--rocket attack, thrown several feet, and that was my experience in combat.  I was left as one for others to rescue; the rescuer became the one who needed rescue (laughter).
Story_ID: 33253
Speaker 1: Do you have a memory of, I guess, what you were doing before the rocket hit?  You said you got to some of the people out there you were supposed to rescue and they were dead basically already, right? (Unclear).
Speaker 2: Ahh, now you--I missed it.  Backup.
Speaker 1: I said that you were sent out to bring back--
Speaker 2: The wounded--
Speaker 1: --and when you got there, you said several were already dead, right?  Did you find any alive out there at all, or--the first time?
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, the medic, the medic who was--I was right at the place--he was shot in the head and blood was comin' outta him like water from a faucet, and I went to try to stop the bleeding, and that's when the rocket came in and hit, hit us.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you were hit with what they call shrapnel? (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: From the rocket was the shrapnel that sometimes can take off a leg or arm--or cut you in two, depending on the size and the way the metal--I mean the rocket came in, it got me on right side and all the metal pieces hit me from the top of my head to the top of my feet on the right side--top of my foot.
Speaker 1: So you were actually--you lost consciousness at that point, right?
Speaker 2: Well, no, because if I had, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you because I woulda never been able to be in a position for the one who came out to find out what happened to me.  So I was able to--I didn't lose consciousness but I was losing a lot of blood, and I was able to low crawl in a position where I thought I would be out of the sight of a sniper.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you remained conscious through the whole ordeal?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: All right.
Story_ID: 33254
Speaker 1: So when you're hit like that--this is--your whole right side is, you know--
Speaker 2: Right.  So I layed under this small bush and I thought briefly 'is this what death is all about?'  And at that time, the head was ringing because of the concussion, and I couldn't hear anything except the whizzing of the undertone of the blast.  So I lay there prepared to die, and just when drifting, a hand--I felt a tug at my shoul--back of my neck--start pulling me, pulling me back to the unit.
Speaker 1: Emm.  Okay.  Now could you feel any pain at that point?
Speaker 2: I thought I--a awful tear under my right arm, and more so I felt the warmth of the blood leaving my body and a tremendous pressure on my right neck, right behind my right ear--a burn.  (Simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--That's where now you have a scar under there now, right?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Can you turn your head to the right, I mean to the left a little bit?  (TURNS HIS HEAD TO THE LEFT).  Yeah, I think the camera can even see that back there behind your neck, yeah. (INTERVIEWER ASKS VIDEOGRAPHER:  Could you pick that up?  Could you see it?)
Speaker 2: Turn your head around (TURNS HIS HEAD FARTHER TO THE LEFT).  There it is, there it is.  See it?  Okay.  I just wanted to show it since it was right up front.
Speaker 1: Now you notice the hearing aid because that was part of the injury.  The blast concussion completely knocked out the hearing; left canal of the left ear is dead because the blast came this way (DEMONSTRATION) and the way the audiologist explained it, it pressed--everything shifted in the body momentarily; that's where the brain is hit in the cranium back and forth.  So the, the pain was in the right shoulder because a portion of the shoulder was blown off, and tearing under the right arm all rippled like a map, all sketched out.  When I went to--the heat of the blast had, had melted the flesh together by the blast itself, so when I reached out, when I start crawling, it just ripped the flesh and that's when the flow of blood come out and now it end up burning, and it was more pronounced when they put me in a stretcher that you can feel, you can feel the flesh or open wound become--yeah, imbedded with the, the dirt and the, and the pressure itself.
Story_ID: 33255
Speaker 1: Okay.  So from what I read, they flew you to Saigon [Vietnam]?  Is that true?
Speaker 2: Hmm?
Speaker 1: Did they fly you to Saigon first, or where did they--or where did you go?  Did you go back to (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--No, I--what happened is this.  Here is the most important part.  You're in the jungle at this location where combat took place, so you have to be moved in to what they consider a safe zone to be even lifted out.  A helicopter has to come in--they're called Medevac, and take you out of that area; sometimes, that's not easy.  Sometimes it don't happen immediately, you have to wait, depending on the condition you're in and the medic that you have on board, they reduce the bleeding like they did for me.  Also, they--usually there has to be more than one injured--most cases, so they--worth the trip to come out to get the wounded.  So sometimes the helicopter can't land, you have to be hoisted up; and in this case, that's what happened for me; I had to be hoisted up.  In the hoisting up, you are subject to (excuse me).  (DEMONSTRATION OF CUTTING THE INTERVIEW).
Speaker 1: Would you like me to cut for a second? (INTERVIEW CONTINUES)
Speaker 2: Okay, so you were air-lifted?
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was being hoisted up--
Speaker 2: Emm hmm.
Speaker 1: --and what came to mind as the, as the apparatus was bringing me up to the helicopter, was that the sniper could still shoot me (laughter) (unclear).  It's just one of those positions where you can do nothing but just have those thoughts.  But it didn't happen fortunately enough, and I was lifted up and I was taken to what is considered the field hospital.  It didn't take long, but the helicopter landed near the field hospital; I believe it was Field Hospital 26 or Field Hospital 26, and they--up the ramp, they put me on a gurney and was bringing me up a ramp and it got into a cool environment and they begin cutting the uniform, the fatigues, from me and they--I remember (laughter) one of the medic--one of the technicians started picking the shrapnel out of me and I asked him was he crazy.  I mean gimme something for the pain (laughter) and he's bringin'--takin' the shrapnel aft--outta me, but I didn't know the needle was stuck in, and I felt this coolness goin' through me, and I literally watched it go up my arm and by the time I could no longer look, I passed out--
Speaker 2: Emm.
Story_ID: 33256
Speaker 1: --and next thing I know, I was waking up in a field hospital in a crowded area with other people bandaged up and that's how I spent--I don't know if it was the second day or after the injury, but at least that's how I spent July 4th, 1969--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --in a Vietnam field hospital.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So they operated on you at that--in the field hospital?
Speaker 1: Correct, right.  Immediately.
Speaker 2: So that means--I suppose you probably need some other medical attention, you know, before you were fully recovered, but (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Oh, yeah, I stayed--yeah, I stayed in Saigon--moved to a Saigon army hospital [Vientnam], and this way I lose time.  Next thing I was in Tokyo or Japan, so they had to go through rehab, and then it was in Anchorage, Alaska, and I believe I was moving towards home--Washington, D.C.--Walter Reed Army Hospital.
Speaker 2: Okay.  So you must have needed periodic expert attention for them to take you to Anchorage and then, you know--Tokyo to Anchorage and then (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Right, was a continued rehab, goin' through the movement, and the final stretch was Walter Reed Army Hospital--
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: --that's where it all came together.
Speaker 2: Now what do you mean it all came together?
Speaker 1: Oh, the audiology, the getting prepared for rehab completely at the--re-assimilated back into the unit, another unit other than the one I was in.
Speaker 2: Now, now, before the interview, you showed me your book ['Serving Under Adverse Conditions'], and in your book is a list of your injuries, right?
Speaker 1: (NODDING HIS HEAD YES).
Speaker 2: And it's like two pages of injuries I think.  So what all happened?  Can you give us some of 'em?  I don't know--you probably can't remember all of 'em, but--
Speaker 1: What, the injuries itself?
Speaker 2: Yes sir.
Speaker 1: Well, there is the top of the head, which the metal fragments hit, and then there's the--in fact there's still some metal fragments on the surface; it didn't go through the cranium but it's on the surface and it left--some is gashes in the head; and then there's the neck itself where the metal went through, and the hearing loss--bilateral hearing loss; and then as you move down, there's the right shoulder, the whole upper part of the right shoulder was blown leaving a gap, a cave, a crevice that eventually--well it went through an infection, but it build up and it's still muscle loss in that area; then there's the rip under the arm itself, going down the side as shrapnel; then there is the right buttocks, the thigh especially thigh--there's gashes in the thigh; and then you go down to the ankle on the right foot and the upper foot; there's metal pieces there; then there's the, the right finger; I thought I lost my ring finger because of the shrapnel hit that when I look, the out--the innards of the finger was hanging out on the side.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I see a scar on it right now where--so they were able to put that back together?
Speaker 1: Then there is--when I said--when I was out street--the stretched arm, the shrapnel ripped this up--let me back up.  Then there is the (laughter) there is still the outward of the upper arm under the shoulder, the deltoid, then there is--between the bicep and the tricep is--all this area is scarred; and then you have the right side--no, the left side of the arm right between the wrist and the elbow is ripped up.  The left ankle, the left ankle was hit when I was layed--stretched out on the ground. So you have that, you have all those shrapnels going then.  So that's how I come to itemize it out like that.
Story_ID: 33257
Speaker 1: And you had it on top of one of your feet?
Speaker 2: Right, it was the right side, right; hit with shrapnel.  So you have a many bits of metal that can be taken out; your body be ripped up, I can't have a MIR, I cannot go through anything that requires magnet that pulls.
Speaker 1: Emm.  Okay, 'cause that won't like--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --move one of these pieces of metal and--okay.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So this is an injury you've gotta live with the rest of your life in other words.  And do these fragments that are still in, do they cause you pain from time to time or--
Speaker 2: Irritation--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --they still come--this is the amazing part, especially around the head; every now and then, you would have bits and pieces of metal poppin' off, comin' to the surface (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Work their way to the surface of the skin?
Speaker 2: Yes, comin' to the surface.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Some just comes to the surface and you can retrieve, some may come out, the smaller pieces.  Now you see we're talking about forty years later.
Speaker 1: Yes sir.  And well, I think your legacy (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Over forty years (laughter).
Speaker 1: They didn't seem to damage your face; it didn't seem to damage your face much, did it?  You know--or any.  I don't see any scars on the right side of your face, so was your head basically down or something?  Is that what they speculate?
Speaker 2: No, that's the where the miracle of blessing come in.  No, it didn't--right, it hit the side.  As close as it got to my face was just the side--the upper head--the top of the head, and the neck.
Speaker 1: Okay.  It seem like the--it's coming from an angle from behind you, I guess.
Speaker 2: Right, was a right angle, hitting over.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, so the curry (ph.) process started Walter Reed is the hearing impairment I had a difficult with.  Speech seemed slurred, impaired, couldn't hear very well, and I worked on my articulation.  A bright idea came to me to work on pronouncing every word, that's why I put in my book ['Serving Under Adverse Conditions'] "I spent time reading a pocket dictionary and enunciating each word until I became comfortable with it."  Having conversations with others during a period of recovery was embarrassing in difficulty.  Well, right now, even though you wear a hearing aid, it can amplify but it doesn't necessary clarify.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so you have to--yeah, it's--people think that if you have a hearing aid, you just turn it up to the level and now you can hear perfectly, but it's not like that.
Speaker 2: No, it's--it could still become very irritating, depending on the environment.  And it was very, very difficult in the early stages of adapting to a hearing loss because one of the things is that I have to live with--but I have learned not to pay attention and never have, it's called tinnitus--
Speaker 1: Emm hmm.
Speaker 2: --where there's a on-going ringing, and only after a period of time, only when it's absolutely quiet or especially like at night right before sleep, you can hear, and become conscious of it--the ringing and popping sounds.  And all those that had a hearing impairment from the war [Vietnam War] have that.
Story_ID: 33258
Speaker 1: Okay now, we in our notes that on July the 4th, 1969, a Western Union Telefax was delivered to your parents which read:  "The Secretary of the Army has asked me to inform you that your son, Private First Class Tyrone T. Dancy, was slightly wounded in action on 3rd July, 1969 by fragments while on a combat operation mission when a hostile force was encountered."  (Laughter)  And so it seems like they kinda minimized the damage (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Precisely, you noticed that?  Right.
Speaker 1: And they give an address by which you can be written, you know--post office box in San Francisco, so--here you are, you're having trouble speaking, your hearing is impaired, so did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Oh, by the way, I--did that--that did not come automatically; my mother had to get Red Cross to intervene in order (for) her to find out anything about me.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Well how did she have a sense that some--had she been trying to communicate with you, to write you, and couldn't find out?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So, as a result of Red Cross--and that's why they'll always be my favorite charity, Red Cross was able to get her that information--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --at least to get some information from the army.
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so this is a devastating injury and you're in Walter Reed [Hospital]--of course, in some respects, you're luckier than a lotta people, but it says here that you were angry about it, right?
Speaker 2: (NODDING HIS HEAD YES).
Speaker 1: Tell us about that feeling.
Speaker 2: The keen situation there, what comes to mind, is the number of injuries and the news that--which will continuously baffle me, why did they feel it necessary to hold on to me and in reality I was not--I was no longer really fit for duty because I was not fully able, by even having a hearing loss, to maintain that soldier position, so they changed my MOS [Military Occupational Specialty].  It baffles me why the military held on to me instead of just giving me a medical discharge 'cause I was really not capable of continuing on as a, as a soldier; I was in not top physical, I probably couldn't even pass their physical fitness test (laughter), so I was--I felt absolutely let down when I found out that they kept me and they wanted to put me back on duty and put me as a clerk, a clerical duty, and I was re-assigned to Fort Devens [Massachusetts], and when I got there, I had difficulty; they assigned me to a headquarters company and they had--they were a combat engineer.  Walter Reed told them that I was not to be placed in a position of loud noises and machinery and that sorta thing because of the hearing loss.  That's another reason why why hold on to me?  When I got to headquarters Company, Headquarters Company had no African American personnel, and I was not received--I was received more so in a curious fashion, it's like why is he here?  And I was awkwardly dealt with, put off, and I said a clerk--they said they had no clerical positions here, it must be a mistake; I was to be part of a line company.  A line company is a laboring company--combat company.  I told them my profile requires that I have clerical duties.  And finally, that was straightened out and I became their Assistant Mail Clerk.
Story_ID: 33259
Speaker 1: In the meantime, I was having troubles--trouble sleeping, and I was having reactionary--later found out flashbacks and uncomfortableness with the previous experience I had in Vietnam, noises and rain and that sorta disturbance.  So finally, I went on sick call again and went to their company doctor.  The company doctor was not very receptive or friendly; he accused me of trying to get out of my military duties and I became so angry by hearing what he said.  After what I went through, I was ready to strike this man; I didn't strike him because it occurred to me that that would only end up leading into a discharge--dishonorable discharge, or the Brigg--being in jail.  So instead, I decided to go to the company hospital, on-base hospital; and I walked up there.  I was--felt so humiliated and insulted; tears welled up in my eyes as I walked up to the hospital, and I couldn't believe after all I had been through, I would still have to go through this aggravating experience to just try to get medical care.  So I walked in the hospital and I seen the desk sergeant; he was one of the kindest individuals I had met in a long time while I was in the military.  He was so receptive and helpful I thought I was being conned; I thought I was being misled or duped to believe I was receiving help, but he did hear everything I said and he did set me up for a later interview of evaluation--physical evaluation to find out whether I was suited and actually able to continue my duties with the United States Army.  So I returned a week later for this appointment and evaluation, and what they discovered legitimized the concern--medical concern that I was not fit for military duty in the condition that I was in at that time.  I was admitted to the hospital and put into the evaluation and medical care, and I was hospitalized for eight to nine months; and the end result, I was placed before the Evaluation Board and according to the workup, I was to be medically discharged.

Speaker 1: Okay.  So how long was it, I guess, from when you arrived in the states and started rehab at Walter Reed [Hospital] to when you were discharged?  How long did that take?
Speaker 2: Believe it or not, it took the whole duration of my draft time; it took (laugher)--in fact, it went one month over my discharge time.
Speaker 1: Okay, so rather than being discharged early, you actually spent more time--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --and most of it was as a person who was unfit for military service--I mean technically being (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: But you said there was a benefit from that, right?  You were telling me before we started the interview that had that not happened like that, you wouldn't have (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Yeah, here's the--the blessing in disguise was I did--initially signed up later.  Before I went to Vietnam, I told them that once I came back from Vietnam, I wanted to make the military, I really did, as a career and I wanted to be a drill instructor, I wanted to go on into--to be part of the military.  But it didn't happen so based on, based on that, and based upon the consideration that was given to me and what I've been through, and that's why I was on the status of being military leave retired--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --which is a good thing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Based--If I were to have been gone without that evaluation, it's possible I coulda been--come out of the service like so many other soldiers and have to fight for all the things--I wanted to establish myself--of the injuries I received while serving the country.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Now when you were--when you left the service or when you were discharged, you were discharged with a Bronze Star, with a V-Device, a Purple Heart, a Vietnam Campaign Medal, Army Commendation, Meritorious Service Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and Combat Infantry Badge, correct?
Speaker 2: Correct.
Speaker 1: Okay.  And I know the Purple Heart is for being wounded--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --Anybody that's wounded gets the Purple Heart.  And so what does the--what is the Bronze Star for?
Speaker 2: Going back to the--asking for volunteers to go out into a dangerous zone to bring back the wounded, and to go about doing that, went to do it but in the process of doing it, you became injured; they consider that a valid--a brave act.  Course, I had a option of declining (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Okay.
Speaker 2: --but I didn't.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So that's for volunteering to go back and rescue others.  And the--I think the--well you got the Good Conduct Medal; we know what that--that's pretty self-explanatory.  Vietnam Service Medal and the Meritorious Service Medal; now that's (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, actually, the firing--there was some--we were asked--there was some firing; remember the firing going back?  The CIB is a Combat Infantry Badge, said that you were in combat and you used your weapon, that you fired in combat, you returned fire to enemy, trying to take out their particular fire upon you--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --so the issuance of the Combat Infantry Badge.
Story_ID: 33261
Speaker 1: Okay.  All right, so--now I didn't ask this in the beginning but were any of your personal friends in the army injured or killed in that fight?
Speaker 2: Yes, the fellow that took my place on flank and a couple others I met just days before going out in the field, so there were three people that I had personal contact with that died; there were at least 16 killed.
Speaker 1: Emm.  Okay.  Yeah, that's--so the lowest point--would you say your lowest point in terms of your own personal feelings and physical state was when you were stationed in--that was Florida where you were?  Or where was it where you were stationed as a mail clerk?
Speaker 2: Fort Deven[s].
Speaker 1: Fort Deven[s]?  And that's where?  Where is that?
Speaker 2: Massachusetts.
Speaker 1: Oh, Massachusetts, okay.  All right, so this is--so things look up after Fort Deven; that was probably the worse time, from what I understand.
Speaker 2: Yes, yes, it was.
Speaker 1: All right.  And where were you discharged from?  Where were you at when you were finally discharged?
Speaker 2: I was discharged from the Fort Devens Army Hospital (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous)--Fort Deven, okay, all right.  Okay, so--well tell us--tell me about what you did when you got out?  How did you--what kinda shape were you in and what did you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--Well, I was still adjusting to the war experience, but I didn't know how much so I was to be adjusting.  A lotta things when you're younger you just ignore and you bury, and you don't feel that it's important.
Speaker 1: I didn't ask you this, but did you have any psychological counseling or anything at Fort Deven?
Speaker 2: And that's interesting; no.  It's absolutely remarkable how they didn't consider the psychological impact of such a thing.  So I put in my book ['Serving Under Adverse Conditions'] that when I was stationed at Fort Devens, there was other guys on the medical ward too, and some of their behavior was driving, drinking and eventually killing themselves on the highways out there in Massachusetts--direct result of the combat experience.  When I returned home, I was able to get a job with the Veterans Administration.  No, let me back up; I got a job with the School Board.
Speaker 1: Okay, now this was before you went to college?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so you got a job at (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous)--I worked as a non-teaching assistant with the School Board of Philadelphia.  I did the best I could but the children were too unruly and I was too discipline-minded to tolerate their behavior, and I was getting any support with the school system, so I had to leave the Philadelphia School System and then I ended up with the Veterans Administration--38th and Woodland Avenue; I worked at the VA Hospital in the Administration Department in the Medical Records Division--
Speaker 1: Emm.  Okay.
Speaker 2: --and I did that for--oh, until I, until I finished my associate's degree with Pierce College.
Speaker 1: Okay.  So you--okay, so you started at Pierce Junior College on the GI Bill, right?
Speaker 2: Right.
