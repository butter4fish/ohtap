 Kite  It   s May 30, 2001. We   re in Boise City, Oklahoma in the Cimarron Heritage  Center talking with Odalee Bohn and Velma Trembly. So we usually just start  with introductions, your name and where and when you were born. We  usually go around and introduce, and then we   ll start with talking. So, if  you   d like to start, that would be great.  Well, I   m Velma Trembly, and I was born in 1921 on a farm 10 miles  northwest of Boise City here, and I   m still on the farm where I was born.  I am Odalee Bohn. I was born February 6, 1916. I was born at Garlington,  Oklahoma, which was a town about 15 miles southeast of Boise City.  Garlington?  Garlington.  And it   s not there any more; is that correct?  No, it hasn   t been there for years and years and years and years, but it was  there in the homestead days.  How did you end up in Garlington?  Well, that was the post office. I lived on a farm south and east of Garlington,  but that was our post office.  And you were in a rural area; you grew up on a farm?  I grew up on a farm.  Did you grow up on a farm as well?  Yeah, like I said, it   s the same farm.  That you live on right now. That   s not very far away from each other either, it  doesn   t sound like. What, you lived 10 miles one way, and you lived 15 miles  the other way?  5  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Yeah, but later we moved about 20 miles southeast of Boise City, and that was  where my grandfather homesteaded in 1906, before this was a state. I lived  there until I was married.  My folks, they homesteaded in 1906. My father   s folks, there were three  brothers, and they came back out and homesteaded in 1906. My mother   s,  that   d be my maternal grandparents, they homesteaded in 1906 and moved just  a quarter west of where my father homesteaded. They had two daughters, and  later the two daughters married.  Well, what was life like for you growing up on a farm?  I enjoyed it.  We loved it. I tell you, we were homesteader   s daughters, and back then the  family did all of the work on the farm. I was the oldest in the family. I never  did anything inside of the house until I was 17 years old. I did everything out  on the farm with my father. My mother said,    You   ve got to go and hire  somebody this summer, because Odalee   s got to learn how to cook and take  care of the house.     Does that sound familiar?  Well, I didn   t work out. They raised broomcorn and maize. I worked in the  house and helped with the harvest and all that.  So you learned to cook and clean early on, while you were outside.  Yeah, but I learned it when I was 17, and I had to do the family work and help  with the farm work when I married.  I had to milk the cows when they were in the field. I had to do that and  separate the milk.  Was there something special about being the daughter of homesteaders as  opposed to somebody who came in later? Was that a source of pride for you?  Yes. The two things that the homesteaders did when they came to Cimarron  County, two things that were very important to them were education and the  church. They built schools around over the country. They had little small  districts. At one time, they had 62 school districts in Cimarron County.  62?  62. The parents then, when they built the schoolhouses, after it became a state,  and they got the money for schools, then older people in the community would  go and arrange for a school building. Then we had church in the school  building until they could get a pastor to come in. In 1918, a pastor came to our  community. It was great. The country was practically all grass. A  homesteader only had 40 acres that he plowed up. Some of the people that  6  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Lemons  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  came didn   t like it, and they   d leave. We kids would go out and herd the cows  out on the open range and bring them in. For that reason, it was just great  growing up as a homesteader   s kid. When we got the churches; that was the  two things. That   s pretty much the same as this county now, is education in  schools and the churches.  Mrs. Trembly, do you have any special thoughts on being a homesteader   s  daughter?  Well, I was always proud to be a homesteader   s daughter, and my grandfather,  Altheus Leady, she was talking about the church, and they had what they  called a Leady Schoolhouse then. He was the superintendent of the Sunday  school in that Leady Schoolhouse. Later, they moved to Boise City and  helped. He was the one that helped start the Methodist Church here in Boise  City.  Just another example of church and schools.  Yeah, to me, that   s what made the five-state area around here, southern  Colorado, eastern New Mexico, and over into Texas County, and about three  counties down in the Texas panhandle. The same group of people; you can  just pretty well tell the same story in any of those families.  You mentioned that you were the oldest child in your family, how many  brothers and sisters did you have?  I had a sister and a brother. My sister was younger than me, and my brother  was the youngest of the family.  Well, I was raised by my aunt and uncle, and my folks lived a half a mile north  from me. I was back and forth most of the time, just going back and forth. I  had a brother.  Now, you lived with your aunt and uncle, but your folks were a half a mile  away?  Yeah, my mother was ill when I was born. My aunt and uncle, I always called  them mom and dad. They raised me. Like I said, I had two sets of parents  almost, but I was with my aunt and uncle.  When you were growing up, did you ever end up living in a dugout or adobe  house? What were your living arrangements like when you were little?  We had a frame house with five rooms.  That   s not a bad setup.  We had a frame house, and had four rooms. One room was large, and my  folks divided that room into half, and they slept in one half and my brother in  the other, and my sister and I slept in one room. During the dirt bowl days, my  7  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  paternal grandmother had arthritis real bad and was crippled, and we took care  of her in the home then. We had a bed set up in the front room for her, and  that   s the way we slept and worked.  When my parents homesteaded out here, they had a dugout at first. Later, they  got married and built the house, and that   s where I was raised, in the house.  When you say your parents, are you talking about your aunt and uncle or your  real mom and dad?  Both of them.  Both sets  Would you say that you were a fairly, I   m just comparing your  descriptions of your house, and it seems like they were fairly nice houses; were  you considered well off at the time?  Well, I couldn   t say that you were well off, but my father came from Indiana,  and his father was the one who homesteaded, and I have the homestead now.  In 2006, it will be in the family 100 years. So when they came, they had lived  in Indiana, where they had farms. They didn   t have anything like dugouts or  anything. They lived in tents until they got their house built. They built it, and  it had plaster on the walls. In later years, that plaster didn   t look so good, so  we had wallpaper. We wallpapered the walls. And the floors, when my  grandparents lived there, were beautiful old oak floors, and then they came out  with this linoleum carpet, 9 X 12.  That   s what we had on our floors, linoleum too   And they would put those down, but you know, they worked and saved what  they could. When you get to the dust bowl, I   ll tell you; I never went hungry,  ever, because we had our own cows, we had our own chickens, we raised our  own pigs, and we cured the meat, sugar-cured meat, and we had two vegetable  gardens a year. In the spring, we   d plant peas.  That   s the same story here.  Then we   d plant peas and potatoes and green beans and everything that you  eat, and then in the fall, they would plant turnips and things like that. We   d  have beets and carrots and onions, and we had a big pit, and we put those in  the pit and covered them with hay. Then, the stuff that we raised in the  garden, we canned and put it in a cellar. We   d can thousands of quarts of food  every year. So when it comes to saying that, by living on the farm, we didn   t  have it like people did in the cities. It was bad. There were some farmers that  had a pretty bad time. It was just great, and I   ll let her tell you something about  hers.  Well, do you think you were fairly equal with the rest of your neighbors?  Yes, equal.  8  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Lemons  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  In some of the stories that we   ve heard people were not living in as nice of  houses as you all, and it seems like you were pretty lucky or fortunate.  Well, our neighborhood out there was more or less the same houses.  Now, my maternal grandparents lived in a dugout until after World War II, and  their two sons were in     Now they lived in a dugout until after World War II?  Yeah, that was my mother   s people. They lived in a dugout until after the First  World War. My uncles came back, and they said,    You don   t have to live in  that dugout anymore,    so they went out and dug up the soil and made an adobe  house. It was four rooms, and the walls were thick. In the summertime, you  didn   t have to have a fan; in the wintertime it was warm. That   s what my  maternal grandparents did.  Do you remember visiting that dugout when you were little?  Yeah.  Did it seem strange to you?  We had a lot of funny things happen in that dugout   Laughter   Uh-oh, now you   re going to have to tell us.  Yeah, now you   re going to have to talk.  Well, one of the uncles that came back from World War I, he had been a  mechanic. He didn   t come back to Oklahoma. He stayed in Iowa and worked  there, and he met a girlfriend. He brought her home. Well it was still kind of  homestead-like country, and she didn   t like that very well. I had an aunt that  was great on everything. This lady was back in the twenties, when they did  the Charleston and all that stuff. She had her knees painted. My aunt and we  kids down in the basement, we got it all fixed up. We got my aunt fixed up,  after this lady left of course. We painted her all up, and fixed her all fancy.  We put on one of those dresses like they wore when they did the Charleston,  and painted her knees. We went and told my uncle,    Say, did you know  Vivian is back to see you,    and he said,    What?    My aunt walked in, and he  liked to have died  laughing   That was fun. We made our own fun in those  days. Everything was done in a way that you didn   t have any of that stuff.  When you say painted knees, what exactly are you talking about?  I don   t know how they did it with paint, but it would have a picture of  something. I don   t remember what it was now, but it was a picture of  something on her knees, and her dress was above her knees, and when she   d  do the Charleston  laughing      9  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  So you   d see the funny picture.  Yeah, and my aunt, she said,    I can   t do the Charleston,    so my sister and I got  out and showed her how to do the Charleston. When she went in, she was  doing the Charleston for my uncle, and he just nearly died.  Mrs. Trembly, what did you do for fun growing up?  Well, I had a horse I loved. I was more or less on my horse. I also played  with the neighbor kids.  Do you remember your horse   s name?  Ranger.  What games would you play, or what would you play with the kids?  Well, it was just different. It wasn   t really games; it was just being together.  That was entertainment enough for you, just getting together.  We   d get together a lot of times and do taffy pulls, pull taffy.  They did more of that out in that community. We didn   t do that too much at  our community.  It was a lot of fun. Kids would get together and do that. I learned to play the  piano; that was one of my hobbies, was the piano. We would go have a  community gather, and we called it play parties. We   d do the Virginia Reel  and all that stuff. There   d be a violinist playing for us, and he   d call the calls.  Then I played on a softball team. One year, in high school, there weren   t  enough boys to make the baseball team, so I played shortstop on the baseball  team. The kids would say,    We   re not playing; there   s a girl on that team.     My community would have dinners at different homes.  What would you have for a typical dinner?  Oh, they   d bring potluck dinners.  Did you have a specialty that you would make that you or your mother was  known for?  She just made different things. She was a real good cook.  Well, here come the Trembly ladies with their special     They were Dixons then.  Every year, our school would have a Thanksgiving dinner, and the whole  10  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  community would be there. One lady, she raised turkeys, and she furnished all  of the turkeys, Mrs. Twoumbly. The rest of the people would just bring  various things that they liked to make. We had a couple of bachelors in the  community, and they would bring sour dough bread  laughter , so they always  had the bread for us.  Is there a big difference between your communities?  Yeah, we weren   t as active.  You see, the thing about it then, the whole county, sometimes we   d go up by  Kenton on the ranch on the Fourth of July, and you   d go by buggy. The  people would   I don   t know, they just kind of looked out for one another.  When it came time to harvest the grain, we didn   t have combines or anything,  and they   d have big thrashing machines, and they   d come around and do the  thrashing. Then, the women would come and help with the dinner, because  there would be 20 or 25 men helping one another. Our family had a thing that  we butchered our hogs with. My first job  laughing    now this may upset  you. I was six years old, and they would hang the old hog up and cut him open  and take his entrails out and put them in a big tub. In hog entrails, they have  an inside and outside, and then they have a strip in between the inside and  outside entrails. They would put this in a tub, and I had a big old flat board  and an old case knife, just a blunt knife, and I   d scrape it down like this. I   d  put the good thing over here in a bucket of salt water. Then, we had a sausage  mill, and you   d put your ham and shoulder and stuff in there and grind it up for  sausage. It   d come out a little spout, and then you   d take these little entrails  and put them over here on there. Mother would have half gallon jars and half  quart jars. You   d wind that up and put it in there, and then they   d can that. So  we had a great big old thing that they put the fat in.  A black pot.  They did too. They put the fat in there and boiled it down. Then you   d just  have the old skins. What did they call them?  Rinds.  Yeah, the rind, and then the fat part would go off. The ladies, we would take  them, I didn   t do that, because I was too young for that, they would take this  fat then, and put lye with it and make our soap to do our laundry with.  We had a lard press. We had the big old pot outdoors, and you all rendered the  lard, and then you ran it through the lard press to get the lard.  We had that, and the people in the community would borrow our hog stuff to  use. Back then, the reason we got along, we bartered. We had something that  the community could use, and they had something that we could use. There  was a family from northeast Texas that came up, and they had a sugar mill.  We would take our cane over there. We raised cane, and they would make us  some syrup out of that, so he would use our hog stuff and we   d use his.  11  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  You said working with the hogs was your first job that you remember?  Well, that and milking cows.  Do you remember your first job Mrs. Trembly, a job you had that was yours  and yours alone to do?  Probably washing dishes and things like that.  Was there a job that you looked forward to doing, a favorite chore you did or  something that you did around the house or outside that was your favorite  thing to do?  No.  Well, I loved the outside, and I would help with the cattle and horses. A  cousin and I, every year that school was out, we   d have to clean out the cow  barn, the cow lot, the horse lot, and put the manure in a manure spread, and  take it out and put it on the land. That was our fertilizer. That   s what my  cousin and I did.  That sounds like it might be your least favorite job.  Well, I don   t know; we kind of enjoyed it. I   ll tell you something funny about  that; my father and my cousin   s dad chewed tobacco, and that was back when  they had it in a block and there was a picture of a mule shoe on it. My mother  would not let my father chew that tobacco in the house, and my aunt would not  let her husband chew it in the house, because a lot of men would spit in the  coal bucket  laughing . Then, to put the coal in the oven, that was awful. So  my cousin and I had been out manuring the fields, and his mother came out  and gave us a big glass of lemonade. We looked down there, and there was  uncle Everett   s big box. They   d buy this stuff by the gross, and he said,    Let   s  fix that,    and I said,    How? How are you going to fix it?    So we took out one  of the blocks, and we just worked and worked until we got that stuff off. So  we laid it out there, and then we went out and got a cow chip  laughter  and cut  it the same size that plug of tobacco was. Then we wrapped it up in this thing  and kind of stuck it down in there.  Uncle came out every morning to do his chores, and he   d get him a plug. The  morning that he found that one, he took a bite, and he just came unglued. My  cousin was in the house, and he and I were herding cattle at that time. He  heard his dad hollering, and he knew exactly what it was. He had all of his  clothes on except his shoes, and he thought,    Boy, I   ve got to get out of here      so he raised the window to his bedroom and went out and went around the  house where they had the cellar to put the canned goods in. He put his shoes  on down there, and he heard his dad talking to his mother,    Where   s Everett?     He went in there, and he couldn   t find him. She said,    Well, he was in there a  while ago; I don   t know where he   s at.    So uncle went back out to the barn.  My cousin, he would always bring his horse and his food to eat that day and  come across the field to our place. I looked out the cow barn   I was  12  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Lemons  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  milking   and I said,    Well there   s Nelson walking over here. I wonder what  happened to the horse.    Well, he got up there, and Dad went out to get some  more cows in, and he said,    Odalee, we   ve got a problem; Dad found the  tobacco. I   ll have to tell Uncle Fudd   that   s what they call my dad   that I   ll  have to take one of your horses. So he told my mother, he said,    Mom didn   t  have any bread, so she wanted you to fix me some sandwiches,    and we went  off and herded cattle all day. By night, Uncle had slowed down a little bit.  We had some Hereford cattle, and I always enjoyed rounding them up with  dad and them, helping out with branding and stuff.  Was that a hard task, to round them up?  Uh-huh, my horse, I just sat up there, and it did it itself. It was really a trained  horse.  It knew what to do?  Uh-huh.  Did you train the horse, or when you got that horse, it was already trained?  Well, yeah. I had another horse called Bunny, and of course, had the colt. I  went out to the colt, and called it Ranger, so I broke it.  Well, were there any people in your family that played music?  Not too much. They did.  You played the piano, you said.  Yeah, my father and his three brothers were a quartet, just a perfect quartet.  My aunt played the piano, and they sang a lot. The whole Cimarron County  would have singings on Sunday, and we would go from home up to Keyes and  over to Kenton and out to Felt and different places on a Sunday, and we   d have  songs. It was the old type songs that we sang. That was great. We didn   t  have T.V. in this time; we didn   t have radios or anything. Everybody got  together and enjoyed one another.  Folks read. Mother read to us at night a lot. I remember the book Tarzan. I  read that book a lot.  Did you dress up in costumes at all?  No, but we had programs at school a lot, the kids did. I was in that quite a bit.  Do you remember any that stand out in your mind that you were in?  Well, I think in one something had flowers and a little basket; I don   t know  what it was all about  laughter . Then, I did take just one year of music  13  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Lemons  Trembly  Lemons  Trembly  lessons. Olive, my girlfriend and I, we played a duet on the piano. It wasn   t  like Odalee  laughing    Well, and back then too, we didn   t have football or basketball every day in the  week  laughing . You got together once in a year. They   d have what they  called the Spring Festival. All of the school districts would come to Boise  City to the high school gym. They   d have piano solos. My cousin and I  played a piano duet, and his sister and he played the violin and I played the  piano for the ensemble. My sister gave readings, and she could talk like a  man, like a kid, and everything like that. We had debates.  We had that too.  Yeah, the whole school. Well, her school would come to Boise City, and my  school and every school in the county, all of the little districts would come.  That was a great time. We   d get prizes for it.  We had pie suppers. I remember decorating the pie boxes  laughing .  Yeah, when they   d have things at school, you   d bring a pie, and then  somebody would buy it.  Is that where the guys would buy it?  They   d buy the pies, and then you   d set with the one that bought your pie.  Yeah, whoever got your pie.  Is that how you guys met your future husbands?  I met mine when he came to work on our place.  That   s the way I met my husband.  The pies?  No, he came to work at the farm.  Right, and then you would take it from there.  We met that way.  How old were you when you met your husband?  Let   s see, I was about 18.  How old was he?  He   s nine months older than me, so he   d be 19.  14  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  What about you?  Let   s see, I was married in    37, born in    16. I   ve been married 64 years.  If you were married in    37, you would have been 30.  I   ve been married 58 years. I was married in    42.  No, I would have been,    16 to    47, I was 20, I think, and my husband was 21.  But talking about the pie suppers, there was a boy I was dating, and he bid on  my pie until he ran out of money, and my husband, he decided, he was with  Junior Walton, and they decided that Dwight wanted my pie, so he finally got  my pie. It made my boyfriend mad, and they about had a fight  laughter .  Then after that, my husband dated quite often. We dated for three months, and  then we were married.  Wow, a very short engagement.  We more or less went together two years. Of course, he worked on the farm  and stayed in the old bunkhouse, you know  laughing . We   d got to shows and  dances.  What was a typical date like? If your boyfriend and/or fianc   came to pick you  up, would you walk out to the bunkhouse to meet him?  No, he ate with us too, you know.  What would you do on a date?  Well, like I said, we went to the show and to dances. That   s what I did.  Well, it was 1936 when my husband and I were going together, and then we  were married in January of    37. His father would give him a dollar, and he  would come and get me and we   d come to the show. Then we   d go down to  the caf   afterwards. We   d buy sandwiches and pie. My husband would go  home with a quarter   Laughter  We   d go to the movie and things.  Do you remember your first date, the first time you went out with a boy?  Well, it was something at Sandyview School, a party there at Sandyview  School. From there, it was the picture show, and just things like that. Several  of our friends would be together, and we   d all go together a lot of times.  When my husband and I were married, back then, they had shivarees. They   d  do everything in the world they could to you on the shivaree. They short  changed your bread and put you in a wheel barrel and rolled you around and  everything. My husband and I decided that they were not going to shivaree us.  We had a windmill, and up on the windmill you have a platform. This was in  January, so we carried blankets one day and put them up there. We knew  pretty well about when they   d be coming to shivaree us. Then you give candy  15  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  and gum to folks, and we hid that under the bed, and we went outside and got  up on that windmill. We laid down up there, and nobody could see us covered  up with those blankets. They came and looked in the house, and they couldn   t  find us, and they said,    Where in the world can they be?    They were just  talking, and we could hear them. We   d want to laugh, and we   d just be real  quiet. Pretty soon, they said,    I   ll bet they   re back there in the pasture  somewhere. They went all around about a mile back there hunting us, and  they couldn   t find us. Well, I tell you what, this just beats anything I   ve ever  heard tell of, so they got in their cars and went off. We waited to be sure that  they didn   t come back. We laid up there a whole hour longer. When we went  in the next morning, they   d got into the candy and gum   Laughter   They found it.  That   s all they could do.  Shivarees seem pretty obnoxious.  Oh, you don   t know. We just do things like that. Back about the dust bowl  and the Depression, we made our own fun, we enjoyed one another, the people  in the community were the same, and they took care of one another. If you  had someone sick in the community, you   d go over and help them, and they   d  do the same to you.  If you were 16, you would have been about 14 or 15 when things started to  change a little bit, and you would have been a little younger.  I was about 13 when that bad dirt storm came over.  Do you remember when things started to get a little more difficult?  1930. It went on through until the first good crop we had was in 1941. We  had dirt, dirt, dirt. 1934 and    35 probably had the worst of the dirt storms.  We always managed to have a little crop. A lot of people, they had to use  thistles for the cattle, but we always managed to have a little crop.  How do you think you managed to have something, and a lot of people didn   t?  I don   t know. We just liked crops and everything.  In 1934, when it was so bad, we had a milk herd of registered cattle  We did too.  You could milk them, and you could also use them for meat. They were that  type of cattle. In 1934, we went down on the Beaver River. Two families of  us took wagons. Back in the early day, you cut the maize off like this; you  didn   t have a combine. You had a backboard up here, so that you could go  along and throw the maize up in there. So we went down on the river there  16  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  and cut yucca. What we did, we took a machete and cut all of the spines off of  the yucca. Then we took those great big   we called them go-divers, it was a  slender spade   and would dig those up by the root. Then we   d throw the roots  in the wagon. There were three families of us. We had three different wagons,  and we   d go out on a weekend after school was out on a Friday and do it  Saturday and Sunday, and we   d get a wagon full of those roots. When we got  the roots there, we brought them home and had them on a great big table like  this, only it was about this wide. Then we would take the machete and cut  those into about two inch squares. We had a machine that would ground that  up into a powder.  The yucca plant is high with protein, and that   s what the cattle had to have, so  we would grind that. Then we   d put the cows in a stanchion, and then we   d  take an old gallon syrup bucket, and take this that had been ground up and put  it in there. Then we would get a cake or some kind of oil. It was compact in a  thing about this big around, and the cows would eat that. That   s what our milk  cows did, because in    34 we didn   t have enough grass for them. That   s what  we did in the dirt bowl days. We had 50 milk cows, and my brother and father  and I would milk those cows, and then we   d sell the cream. The cream would  be shipped up to Dodge City or somewhere, like theirs was. Then we   d have  our wheat, and they had a mill in Elkhart, and they would mill our wheat. That  way, we had flour for our bread. Who were those people here in Boise City  that had the flour?  Raulstons.  Raulstons. They had it too. That   s the way we had our bread then. It was off  of the farm. It didn   t cost you 89 cents a loaf for about two ounces of wheat   laughing .  We had about six or seven milk cows, and we sold cream like they did. That   s  the way Mom made cottage cheese. It was really good. Then we sold the  cream.  When they had the chickens, and they got kind of old to where they didn   t lay  too well, they   d bring the in here to town and sell the chickens, and the people  in town would buy those old chickens. We used the young ones.  I remember Capper   s Weekly magazine. They   d come out there to subscribe  to the magazine, and they   d take anything, chickens or a battery.  Yeah.  You   d trade the chicken or battery for the magazine?  For the magazines, they   d just take something like that. Do you remember that  Odalee?  Yeah, we   d give them batteries. It was sort of a barter. It wasn   t like it is now,  how you have to have money to pass out. Money was kind of scare.  17  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  And I still take the old Capper   s Weekly.  My father would half-sole our shoes. We had a stand   I think there   s one in  here somewhere   it would be up this high, and then they had a thing that was  shaped like your foot. They   d have a small one, a medium size one, and on up  there. Dad had an awl, and I still have the awl, and I still have these things  that he set up there. He would take our shoe and put it over there, and then he  would take the old sole off. Then he would go around and punch holes in  there with that awl, and then he would take a little tiny strip of leather and sew  through there until it sewed on. Later on in the Depression, they got to where  they could half-sole your shoes with rubber, like way back; they would fix an  inner-tube tire. It   s not like your tires now. Your tires had an inner-tube in it,  and it had some stuff that they could scrape off and then put some other stuff  on there, and that   s the way that my father did our shoes.  Do you remember the thinking for the first time that times were kind of hard     that things weren   t as good as they used to be? Did something happen in  particular that comes to mind?  I just remember during the dust bowl days, the awful dust. That   s when I  learned to love grass  laughing .  Yeah. In 1927, we had a good wheat crop, and my father bought a Maytag  washer with a five-horsepower motor on it  laughing .  Yeah, we had the same thing.  And then, they came out with the Electrolux refrigerators that ran on propane.  People said,    Well, what did you do in the early days?    Well, we had a big old  windmill and a big house that was full of water, a great big water tank. The  water would come into the tank from the windmill, which would be cold. On  the inside of this water house was where we had our separator, and we had a  great big trough that ran out to the horse tank.  Yeah  laughing .  She   s going to tell you the same thing. It went out there to the horse tank. So  we   d milk the cows, and we had a separator that separated the cream from the  milk. We put the milk in there and the cream in there and leftover food in  there. We   d eat the leftover food for supper. You never had anything spoil.  That water was cold.  It went right from the windmill to the trough. We   ve still got the old trough  lying out there.  My father, even back in the homestead days, he fixed an underground pipe  from the windmill into the house. Water would run into the house, and we   d  have a table there with a big old pan on it so we could wash it. In the dirt bowl  days, we had the same thing. We had water in the house, but we didn   t have a  bathroom.  18  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  That   s right.  We didn   t have a bathroom. You can write down the same thing down for her  too  laughter . Then we had a wind charger in the dirt bowl days.  We had a wind charger.  And we had a radio. We had    Amos and Andy.     I think we had a battery radio.  Yeah, well it ran from this wind charger.  We just had lights with our wind charger.  We had this wind charger out there, and a lot of people didn   t have it. My  father, besides what we did on the farm, had everything to eat. They were  building roads and a railroad into this part of the country. Dad would take his  horses and a thing and rake up dirt and stuff, and he got so much an hour for  that. That   s the way he would buy the sugar and the salt and stuff like that.  The thing that I learned about the dirt bowl days was caring for one another.  That is still with me. When I see somebody that   s having it real rough, and I  know that it   s not a thing that they are doing to make it rough, it   s just  something that   s happened to them, and Velma can say the same thing, you  want to help them. You help them all you can, even if it takes a little money.  Then, helping one another, and just knowing one another. I don   t think  anybody in this county has an enemy. I would say that; would you say that  very many people would have an enemy?  No, they don   t agree on everything, but as far as I know     Well, my father always said,    If there   s a principle involved, and you know it   s  the right principle, to stand by it even if it costs you your life.    He said,    If  you   re in a group and one guy   s got an idea and you   ve got an idea and you   ve  got an idea that if you keep putting your idea first and later on it doesn   t work  out, you have to be big enough to apologize for that.    That   s the way all of the  people around here were raised. You just didn   t do that.  My folks always told me, you know how to live, so live it right. You   ve got  one time to live and one time to die.  Back in the dirt bowl days when some of the people were leaving, we had a  family that was leaving and went to California. Then we had another family  that was leaving, and they went to Oregon during the dirt bowl, but they came  back after the dirt bowl and are still here. They would come by and say to my  dad,    Ezrie, why in the world are you staying here in all of this dirt, in all of  this stuff? You   ve got your home. You   ve homesteaded and you   ve got this.  Why do you want to stay here?    My dad said,    I want to tell you something;  I   m not leaving, because it   s not always going to be like this. We   re going  through a time that   s hard. Do you think that I   m going to leave a home where  19  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  my kids have plenty to eat, plenty to wear, and everybody helps one another,  to go to a big old city and live in a tent and stand in a line to get food?    They  said, Well Ezrie, you   re libel to starve.    Dad said,    No, the land will take care  of me, and if it gets bad enough, we can eat snake.     My parents never had any intention of leaving either. Of course, we always  got by.  And so my dad stayed, and we stayed, and we went through dirt storm after  dirt storm after dirt storm, and we would fix the houses. We   d put sheets up to  the windows and tape the windows outside and in. The worst storm was the  Black Sunday in April of 1935.  Well, I guess I   d better go if it   s all right.  Before you go, tell us about the first dust storm you remember.  Well, it was that Sunday one. It was on a Sunday, and we had been in town.  We saw that thing a coming, and we were out at Sandyview School, and we  parked there until that thing went over. After that, all the dirt came up at  different times.  Were you afraid when you saw the first one coming?  Yes, I didn   t know what in the world it was.  And you stayed in the car?  Uh-huh, we stayed there, and then finally we made it home. It was a beautiful  Sunday morning.  A beautiful day  A gorgeous day   Would you say that was the beginning of the dust bowl?  Both of the ladies  say no.   That was the worst storm.  There was wind and dust, and we had piles of sand just everywhere.  Did your dad feel the same way about staying?  Yes, he had no intention to leave.  Did you have a lot of neighbors and friends that did leave?  They all stayed around, the neighbors. None of them left.  We only had those two from our community.  20  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Lemons  Trembly  Did they all feel the same way, that the land would support you?  Well, they thought we were nuts. I had an uncle that left in 1935, and he was  mad because my dad and the other two brothers wouldn   t go back to Indiana  with him. Back in Indiana, you had to pay 50 percent. In Indiana when you  rented a place, you gave your landlord 50 percent.  Well, if you have to leave, I don   t want to keep you any longer.  Well, I enjoyed it.  Well, I   m glad you could come help us out.  Helped a little.  Yeah, I think you helped a lot.  The thing of it is, our stories are so near the same, you see. The things we did,  and see, she lived way over out this way, and I lived way over out that way. I  lived 20 miles out that way, and how far is it from here to your house?  10 miles.  That   s 30 miles apart.  And it sounds like they were fairly different communities.  They were different.  What do you think was the difference? You said your community didn   t do all  of the social activities.  Our mostly social stuff was at the Sandyview School and dinners at different  people   s houses.  What do you think was the difference between the two communities?  I don   t think there was that much difference.  Not too much difference.  Just different habits or practices. All right, well Mrs. Trembly, thank you so  much for coming in. We   ll be sending you a transcript in the mail.  Okay, is there something quick that you   d like to ask me?  How do you think the dust bowl changed who you are?  Changed who I am?  21  Kite  Trembly  Lemons  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Kite  Trembly  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Trembly  Bohn  Kite  You lived through a pretty big time.  I still don   t care for the cities. That   s all I can say.  You mentioned earlier that those dust storms made you appreciate grass.  And I always wanted to plant grass  laughter . Sometimes, we even sewed  some grass. I think it would have been best to just leave some farmland there,  but we sewed.  Just to have it.  Okay.  Thank you very much for coming in.  It was good to see you Odalee.  Yeah, it was good to see you Velma.  Yeah, we got it together, didn   t we  laughter ?  Well we   ve been friends a long time.  How long have you been friends?  Oh gosh, since 190   oh, dear, well, we   ve been closer friends since about  1950.  The folks cooked on a stove like that. We had one of them.  Yeah, we had one of them. When my husband, after he had asked me to be his  wife, he came over and he said,    Well, I guess I   d better buy us some rings.     At that time, we used cow chips. We didn   t have the wood like they have  everywhere else. We used cow chips, and then put the coal on it. The cow  chips started the fire, and the coal would burn. So we put some cow chips and  some more coal in there, and sat on the oven door and had the Montgomery  Ward catalog. My husband turned over where the rings were. He said,    Now  you pick out the ring you want.    I said,    A ring,    and he said,    No, an  engagement ring and wedding ring.    So I looked through there and found  what I wanted. I got a wedding ring and an engagement ring for  25 and some  cents  laughing . That was my wedding ring. I wore that until about 1950,  and they broke and just fell apart. I had to get another set, and that was this set  here. That was how we did it. When I saw that stove, I thought, boy that just  brings back memories. We had the thing up there that you could set the stuff  up to keep it warm and everything. We had that kind of a stove. We had a  good year in    27.  I just have a real quick question. The  25 for the rings; I would think that that  would be a lot of money then.  22  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Bohn  Yeah, he thought he was buying me something that would be really great.  This look now, is  400 and  500 they pay for them.  That   s probably the same.  25 is probably about the same as  500 now.  They were nice rings, and when I bought these, they were  300.  I didn   t mean to interrupt you. You said in 1927, you had a good crop.  Yeah, that was when my dad bought the washing machine and refrigerator for  Mother. My grandmother was there with us all during the Depression and the  dirt bowl. Back to the dirt bowl days, they started in 1930, and I graduated  from high school in 1935. The community always had a big dinner for us.  And a storm came in and nobody could come. It was such a storm. Dirt just  blew everywhere, and nobody wanted to get out in it. The next day at school,  all of the school was there for dinner. That was a disappointing thing, not to  have our dinner and here was the dirt.  You had the big dinner cooked and ready to go?  Yeah, they had it ready for us, and that storm blew in and it was just terrible.  We didn   t have too many of the big rolling storms. We had a few of them, but  they weren   t anything like the Black Sunday; that was the worst. The dirt  would blow in and it would be so dusty. We   d be out working, and we   d have  to wear a mask to keep the dirt out. If the men would get out and lose that,  they   d have to put a handkerchief around their face like that to keep the dust  out. In    33 then, it got so bad, and in    34 it was worse, and it was month after  month after month that there would be dust blowing. Sometimes, we would  come into Boise City and a storm would come up. The wind was always out  of the southwest, mostly. When we   d get home, the right side of our car would  be sanded off.  The paint was all gone?  Yeah, well, it   d be gone enough to where it was just bodied, you know. The  year that I was a senior, I came down with the mumps, and then I had scarlet  fever. That was in    35; back then, they quarantined you. We went to my  grandmother   s, and my mother went there to help take care of me, and my  father took care of the things at home. April 14th, I had got up, and it was a  beautiful day and Dad had come home. What they did, they would burn  formaldehyde after they had quarantined the place. They   d burn this  formaldehyde to kill all of that. They did that about three days before then, so  Dad came and said that it was safe for us to go home now on that Sunday from  grandmother   s. We were going east, and I looked out and said,    Oh, there   s a  cloud, maybe we   re going to have snowstorm.    We had to drive one mile east  and three miles south. Before we got home, I said,    Dad, that thing   s awful  looking.    He stopped the car, and he said,    Well, I   d better put on the gas.    I  looked up, and the birds were just flying ahead of that dirt storm, just by  droves. By the time we got into the yard and out of the car, we got down there  and rushed into the house and mother lit the lamp, it was dark. It was four  23  o   clock in the afternoon, and it was as dark as midnight. You couldn   t see  your hand like this in front of you. That   s how dirty it was. Mother rushed  and got some washrags. While she was doing that, the lights went out. She  said,    Oh my goodness, you get on the floor.    So the whole family got on the  floor with a washrag up here on our face. We were there for nearly an hour,  and then it began to get a little lighter and a little lighter and a little lighter.  We got up, and we didn   t know what it was. We didn   t know what to expect.  We didn   t know whether the house would still be there or whether we   d blow  away or whether we would die or what would happen. None of the other dust  storms were that bad. Sometimes, we   d have five days of dirt in a row, and  there would be a kind of a rain cloud come up. The next morning when you  went out, there were little mud dots all over the house where the moisture in  that rain cloud had made mud balls out of the dirt that slapped up against the  house.  When my husband and I were married, an uncle had moved to town, to Boise  City. He wanted us to stay on the farm, because he had some cows and hogs  that he didn   t want to sell until the fall. So my husband and I set on there at  the farm. When we set up house keeping; my parents, before my dad bought  my mother the Maytag washer, we had a washing machine where you   d go  like this. It was a tin tub and on each end was a washboard. You   d push it  hardest up here, and it would wash them down this way. Then you had a thing  that wrung there to wring your clothes out. Nowadays, they have great parties  for these kids to get married. I went to my grandson   s, and boy, they got stuff  to fix the house forever. I didn   t get that. Our pastor and his wife, they  decided they   d have a little thing for us. She made some tea towels that had  Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday on  them. All of the community came there. That was back when you didn   t have  very much money. I got six sets of salt and pepper shakers  laughter , and  they were 25 cents a set. And those tea towels were my party.  My husband and I, we would go over there and milk the cow, and sometimes  the dust was so bad that we would have ropes that we   d tie to the kitchen door  and to the barn so we wouldn   t get lost. So we   d go out there and milk the  cows and feed them and come back in. We did the same thing with the hogs  and the chickens and everything. In those days that we had five days of dirt,  we played cards to see who would go feed the calves. The winner would not  have to go, but the loser would have to go. Then we   d do every chore that  way. We ate sardines, that was our main food when we were first married.  We had a table and four chairs. If we had company, we could let the table out.  We had nail pegs that set in there, and we   d set a board across there, and that   s  what people would set on. When they   d get through, they   d all gather around  and have fun. We would have my parents over for dinner, and we didn   t have  very much to feed them. I didn   t have a garden or anything. We did have the  chickens and we had one of those Model-T Fords, coupe, and the wheel kept  running off of it. So one day, the wheel was off and we couldn   t get it back  on, so we were going over to my father   s. We had a dog, a pup, and we had a  duck and some little geese and had the chickens and the cats. We were going  to walk across, about a mile, down to my dad   s. My uncle said we could have  a pig to butcher of our own when it came time to butcher. The pig here came  24  Kite  Bohn  Kite  Lemons  Bohn  along, and here came the chickens and everything following us. We had to  take them back to there, and this pig was our guard. People would come to  bring the propane to us, and the guy would honk his horn and say,    Odalee,  come get that hog out of here     The hog wouldn   t let him out of the truck.  We had a pet dog and everything like that.  We had been married in January, and in    38, we didn   t have a crop. We didn   t  have anything. Dwight   s mother and stepfather lived in Wichita, Kansas, and  they just begged us to come to Wichita and for Dwight to get a job there.  That   s where we went during the war years. A lot of people say,    I don   t  know how you did that.    Well, our father wasn   t going to leave the country;  he said,    It   ll get better, it   ll be great some day. You won   t know it   s the same  country.    They taught us to put up with what we had to. My dad   s mother  would tell us kids when we were small,    Anytime you have a problem, you  solve it if you can, and don   t think you can   t, because you can do something to  solve it, but if you absolutely cannot solve it, take it to the Lord and forget it.  If you   ll do that, you   ll never have ulcers.    That   s the way we were taught.  The values that we received during the dust bowl days are still with us. If we  hadn   t gone through that and had had everything fancy here and fancy there  and fancy somewhere else, we wouldn   t have cared about our neighbors or  anything else. That   s the thing I feel about the dust storm.  So you think it was helpful for you to go through the dust bowl experience?  Well, our parents taught us the values of life and things that you should do in  life and things you shouldn   t do. Like for me and my sister, we had clothes,  and if we outgrew them, our cousins a little younger than us got the downcasts.  Our mother sewed for us. Dad would buy feed sacks, and they would have  flowers in them. They   d have stripes in them. They   d be blocks. Mother  would tell Dad how many feed sacks he   d have to have to make us a dress. He  would buy them. Then, we took the Montgomery Ward and the Sears and  Roebuck catalog, and if they had some money, they would order material, and  our mother would make our clothes. My sister had asthma and hay fever, and  she couldn   t work outside, so she became the seamstress of the family, and me,  I   d rather be out milking cows and riding horses. When you talk about kids  now that race up and down the road, why do they race like that? Well, when I  was kid, I ran a horse like that  laughter .  It   s the same thing. Well, anything else?  I think we   ve covered everything.  It says what was it like in your household on a typical day. Every morning,  my mother read from the Bible for us. It didn   t make any difference what was  going on; we   d have breakfast and the Bible reading. Each one of us kids was  taught to pray, and we had to say a blessing before we ate, morning, noon, and  night. Then we would go about our daily chores, and do whatever we had to  do. Like I said, the homesteaders people, the family did the work; you didn   t  depend on somebody else to do your work. That was the thing that helped us,  25  Kite  Bohn  because we all had to learn how to work and how to take care of ourselves.  The people who lived in town, they didn   t have it as lucky as we did on the  farm. You want to know what caused the dirt storm. When the homesteaders  homesteaded, they broke out 40 acres on the land. Their homestead was up in  five years; they had to live there five years. They did that and they got it all  settled, and then in 1926, that   s when they started breaking the land out. In     27, we had the biggest wheat crop that we ever had; it was 60 bushels to the  acre. That   s when Dad got to do all of these things that he wanted to do for  Mother. Then the drought came in 1930, and the wind just blew and blew and  blew. Most of the land in this county is the blow type land. I have some land  that is not that type of land. They plowed that up, and well, there wasn   t any  grass to hold the soil. Then, they would try to work and they   d go out and try  to work, and that would make it worse. Then they came along and told them  they had to do something different. Then the soil conservation came in, and  set up ways to do things. My father-in-law worked land that had thistle on it  this type, and then sand blew up around it. They had to level that out. You  could go out there and see the farm now that he farmed, and it has irrigation on  it and beautiful crops all over it.  One thing that we got by with, the government had an FSA thing, and they  loaned the farmers money. In 1934, we had to cut down on our milk cows and  everything. The government said they   d give  17 a cow. That was the only  time that I ever saw my father cry, and I cried too. They dug a great big pit out  there on the ranch, and herded the cows into a place, and they marched them  out to this great big hole, and they   d shoot them and they   d fall in there. You  got  17 a piece for those cows. That was probably the hardest. Then they had  the WPA that people could work under during that time. When I went to  college, I went under the NYA, National Youth Administration, and I worked  my way through college. They paid form my books and my room. I worked  in the cafeteria for the school. I worked in restrooms. I worked in a sewing  class. In the sewing class, they had a school at Fort Supply that was for the  people who were mentally ill. We would make dresses and nightgowns for the  women, and undergarments. For the men, we would make night shirts and  shirts. If you   ve tried to make a shirt and put cuffs on it and sleeves, that is  something. We had a girl from Texas who was going to school up there, and  she was in our class, and the government was going to come out and take a  picture of all of us kids that were working our way through school. She said,     I   m going to fix a banner for us.    They came out, and up on the building  where they took our picture, she had the banner hung. It had the ISS in great  big letters up there. When the fellow was taking the picture, one of the asked  what the ISS was for. Wanda said,    That   s Insane Shirts Source     laughter    That was my first year of college.  Did you go to Goodwell?  Uh-huh, I went to Goodwell. After we went to Wichita, I went to Friends  University there, and that   s where I got it. I worked for a big company there  for years. Dwight was a railroader until 1949, and then we came back to take  over his father   s farms, and we   ve been here ever since. A lot of the kids     that was one thing our parents were interested in was for us to get an  26  Kite  Bohn  Kite  education. We got through high school, and had good schools and good  teachers, and nearly all of us went to college and finished college. My major  was psychology, and my minor was music.  That   s an odd combination of studies.  Yeah, an odd combination of studies. We did our laundry when it was  storming. We had ropes from one end of the house to the other, and we hung  our clothes inside to dry. But you know, we had a good life. It was bad as far  as material and money was concerned, but money wasn   t the thing that kept us  together.  All right, I think you did a great job.  -------  -------
