Story_ID: 259069
Speaker 1: Let's begin talking about your mother, starting with your mother's name, and where she was born, and where she grew up as a girl.
Speaker 2: Yes, my mother's name is Mrs. Elisabeth, and that's spelled with an 's', E-L-I-S-A-B-E-T-H, Ridley, R-I-D-L-E-Y, Chavis.  She's a native of Oxford, North Carolina, where my mother and father [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.], all of us are from Oxford, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: And can you just--did she ever share any stories with you about what life was like for her as a girl growing up in Oxford and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, my family grew up in a segregated community, eastern North Carolina, near the Virginia border.  I like to refer to it as Nat Turner territory.  My mother was a schoolteacher.  She taught school for fifty years in the Granville County [North Carolina] schools.  She started out when teachers only had one room, and she was the teacher of the schoolhouse, and later became an elementary school teacher.  In fact, my mother taught myself and all of my sisters at a place called the North Carolina Colored Orphanage [Colored Orphanage of North Carolina; Central Children's Home of North Carolina, Oxford, North Carolina].  There were two orphanages in North Carolina, one for blacks and one for whites, and they were both located in Oxford, North Carolina.  My mother and father worked for some time, period of time teaching at the North Carolina Colored Orphanage.  So my first elementary school years, one through seven, grades one through seven, I went to school with orphans, black orphans.  And that helped shape my understanding of life, of what it means to be fortunate enough to have both of your parents, 'cause most of my classmates did not have parents.  So, my mother's a schoolteacher.
Speaker 1: And how would you describe your mother?
Speaker 2: My mother was a freedom fighter in her own right.  I remember when I was six years old, because my mother was a schoolteacher, she would always buy Christmas presents for her students, because they were orphans.  And one December, this had to have been in the early 1950s, we were in a local store, Williams Drug Store in Oxford, North Carolina.  My mother bought all these gifts, about twenty gifts.  And they were wrapping the gifts, and a young brother, a young black man, about eleven--young black boy--around eleven years old--I was six--came in and bought a milkshake.  And as he walked--he paid milkshake, and as he was walking out of the store, he stuck the straw in the milkshake and just, you know, drank a little of the milkshake.  The woman who was waiting on my mother cussed this young brother out for sipping the milkshake inside the store, because back in that time it was taboo, in some sense illegal, kind of a southern apartheid.  You could not eat or consume anything inside of the establishment where you bought it.  And so my mother felt that what this white lady was, the clerk was saying to the young brother was wrong.  And so my mother grabbed these gifts that she had just paid for and threw 'em up in the air, and she said, "I'm never gonna set foot in this drugstore for the rest of my life."  I felt so proud of my mother.  Even though I was just six years old, I wanted to see black adults fight back.  I knew at the age of six that racism was wrong, that injustice was wrong.  I didn't know the--I couldn't--I didn't know the word apartheid then, but I just knew that racial discrimination was wrong.  And I didn't like, even by that age, how my parents or everybody was treated.  They would always refer to my mother by her first name, never called her Mrs. Chavis, always called her Elisabeth.  They would call my father--wouldn't never call him Mr. Chavis, some other--you know, that was part of the indignities.  So I grew up just waiting to see black folks fight back, you know.  And so I was very proud of my mother that day for fighting back in her own way. And you know, my mother lived till she was ninety-five years old, and she never set foot back in that store.
Story_ID: 259070
Speaker 1: Did she [Chavis' mother, Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] ever share any stories with you about just, you know, what her days were like teaching and during that time, and even what, what it was like growing up as a little girl?  Did she ever talk about that at all?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, it was rough.  The perception was, from my mother's generation, that education was a means toward greater freedom.  And so my mother was one of the first black women in our county not only to go to college but get her master's degree.  It was unheard of in the 1950s.  You know--
Speaker 1: Where did she go to college?
Speaker 2: She went to undergraduate school at North Carolina College for Colored People [sic. North Carolina College for Negroes], which is now called North Carolina Central [University, Durham, North Carolina].  But it was called, back in those days in Durham [North Carolina], North Carolina College for Colored People.  And she got her master's degree in education also from NCC.
Speaker 1: And how was it that your mother was able to go to college?  Was her family able to send her?
Speaker 2: Well, work hard, not only did my mother go to college, but many of her sisters went to college.  I come from a family of preachers and educators both on my mother and father's [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] side.  But one of the things, you know, is interesting, as I recall the stories, we would always have family stories around the dinner table, whether it be breakfast, or lunch, or at dinner.  And my mother would always tell me these stories about seeing lynching parties.  Back in those days, nobody had running water; everybody had a well.  And one day some white men on horses stopped by, and they didn't ask for water, just to get water from our well.  And my mother and her sisters knew that these men had just come from lynching somebody.  There's a place in Oxford [North Carolina], my hometown, called Lynches Hill [sic. Lynching Hill], where they used to lynch people.  And I was--those stories were horrifying, but I was always interested 'cause I wanted to know, well, why didn't y'all poison the water?  Why didn't y'all do something to 'em?  Why didn't y'all pull 'em off the horses?  You know, don't--and of course, you begin to understand that there were limits to what you could do in those days to fight back.  And so I understood from my mother what resistance, and also from my father; my mother and father were very close.  My father is much older than my mother.  My father fought in World War I [WWI].  And so, but yes, the importance of education, very religious; my mother and father were in the church.  I was born into the church.  I believed in God but believed that God was a god of freedom, a god of justice, that God was not pleased with anyone accepting injustice.  And this was talked about.
Story_ID: 259071
Speaker 1: Let's talk now a little bit about your father, starting with your father's name, and where he grew up as a boy, and stories he may have shared with you as a boy, and just--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --about your father.
Speaker 2: My father's name is Benjamin Franklin Chavis, Sr.  In fact, back in those days, he had, full name was Benjamin Franklin Person Chavis, Sr.  And I would ask my father, "Why'd you have all those names?"  And of course, a couple of the names were after counties.  There was a Person County [North Carolina] and a Franklin County [North Carolina].  So I said, "Well, why weren't you named Granville, since you were born in Granville [County, North Carolina]?"  And you know, but names are hand-me-down names, was a way not only to identify what territory you were born in but connectivity.  Again, my father was somewhat of a disciplinarian.  He was a brick mason by trade.  He was a schoolteacher.  And what I mean by disciplinarian, he would let you know in no uncertain terms he was a veteran of World War I [WWI].  He was a mason.  He was very proud of his service in military, United States military.  But he also told me these stories about how the [U.S.] Army was segregated, and how soldiers would be wounded in France and other places in Germany, and would have to come back to the United States on segregated ships, even thought that they were wounded.  And sometimes the prisoners that were taken prisoner--the Germans, white German prisoners were treated better than black soldiers who had got wounded fighting for the country, you know.  And of course, the VFW, the VFW Post, Veterans of Foreign War[s] Post was a place where frequently I would go with my father listening to these war stories from World War I.  My father was also the scoutmaster, Boy Scout master, so I grew up in the Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts, Explorer Scouts; scouting was of very much import.  But again, the Scouts, the Boy Scouts of America was segregated.  I used to get mad every Christmas.  We have to always march in a Christmas parade, and the black Boy Scouts would always have to march behind the white Boy Scouts.  I didn't like that, because I knew we could march better, but you know, that was part of the situation.  I guess the most enduring story that my father told me was what happened to my great-great-great-grandfather.  His name was John Chavis, also a native of Oxford, North Carolina, Granville County.  My family's been in this county in North Carolina for over two hundred years.  John Chavis was born in 17--in the 1760s.  He actually fought in the Revolutionary War.  He was a land owner.  His father owned land, and--
Speaker 1: John Chavis' father owned land?
Speaker 2: Owned land, right.  There were a lot of African Americans, blacks that owned land in the Carolinas [North Carolina and South Carolina], and a little part of southern Virginia, but mostly in the Carolinas.  And when it came time to fight the British, they took up arms, hoping that they would be part of the founding of the new country, although after the Revolutionary War, history teaches us that no blacks were permitted to go to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania].  But the story my father told me was that after 1832, I believe, 1832, 1833, after the Nat Turner insurrection, which took place in southern Virginia, northern North Carolina, the State of North Carolina, the State of Virginia, the State of South Carolina, State of Georgia passed the law making it a felony to teach blacks how to read.  My great-great-grandfather was a schoolteacher and a Presbyterian minister.  In fact, he was the first African American to be ordained in the Presbyterian church in the United States.  John Chavis is his name.  He's the first black to graduate from Princeton University [College of New Jersey, Princeton, New Jersey], John Chavis, Presbyterian minister.  But he was a school--back in those days, the preachers also were educators; they taught school.  And John Chavis had a school for blacks and whites.  But after the Nat Turner insurrection and after the state passed these laws, he was barred from teaching blacks.  It's crazy; I mean he could only teach whites.  So, of course, in the tradition of the Chavis family, my great-great-grandfather set up an underground school in northern North Carolina, in Granville County, in a little part called Satterwhite Shop, North Carolina.  And this underground school is about ten, fifteen miles from the Virginia border.  It's in a rural area.  My father used to take me up to Satterwhite Shop and say, "Look, this is the place where your great-great-grandfather set up an underground school."  In 1838, my father had a--my great-great-grandfather had a buggy, a horse and buggy, and he was coming from the school one day.  And a group of white men stopped him, pulled him out of the buggy, and beat him to death.  And not only did they beat him to death, but after killing, they hid his body from the family.  And so my father told me that it was passed down through the generations where his body was buried.  But you see, 'cause in those days, when an atrocity was done to you, they would always try to hide it.  It's not like simply where they would just leave you on the side the road, and your relatives come pick you up.  So, he was actually buried on a white man's farm called the Mangum Farm--[Willie Person] Mangum--who later became a United States senator.
Story_ID: 259072
Speaker 1: And so, for decades my family has gone on expeditions trying to find the gravesite of John Chavis, and also to keep this story alive in the history of the rootage of the family in Africa as well as in America and what travail, what our struggle has always been about; pleased to report that one of my sisters, older sister, Dr. Helen Chavis Othow, who is a professor now at North Carolina Central University [Durham, North Carolina], found the gravesite.  And she's written a book about--called 'John Chavis, a Patriot.' [sic. 'John Chavis: African American Patriot, Preacher, Teacher and Mentor (1763-1838)']
Speaker 2: How did she find it?
Speaker 1: Just through sheer determination.  I went, I used to go on these expeditions with my sister.  She would get a group of people, and mainly relatives, and we would go out and scour cemeteries, mainly--one thing about cemeteries, in my home site right now in Oxford [North Carolina] where I was brought up in, we have a family cemetery that is almost 150 years old.  One of the things segregation did, it allowed you to trace where you came from because they didn't want you buried in a white cemetery.  Well, what happened was a lot of families had their own cemetery; we had our own cemetery.  So, the Mangum Farm, which is in Durham, North Carolina, by this time, it had become--the state acquired the property, and so it's sort of a state museum.  And after about maybe eight years of research, of going out every summer looking for a particular grave, how could you find a grave?  She stumbled across--well, she first read some of the manuscripts of Mangum family, what's referred to John Chavis and how they felt dearly about him.  So we didn't find his grave where normal slaves were buried.  We found his grave, what we think is his grave, near the Mangum family's grave.  And sure enough, there was this rock, etched on it, J. C.  And my sister, with a lot of other research, believes that this is the grave of John Chavis.  And there's a picture of it in the book and all this stuff.  We wanted to get an archaeological--you know, with all of the latest DNA tests, you can go and get remains and--but the state won't allow it.  So we may have to go to court or some other--you know, to force the state to allow us to have this excavation so there can be irrefutable evidence that this is John Chavis' gravesite.
Story_ID: 259073
Speaker 1: Do you have any other family stories about ancestors and other relatives?
Speaker 2: Well--
Speaker 1: How--actually, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.], how far back can you go?  Is John Chavis the furthest back you can go in terms of tracing your ancestry?
Speaker 2: Well, John, we know about John Chavis, as my great-great-great-grandfather.  He was born in 1760s, but obviously, he didn't drop out of the sky.  He had parents, which goes back to the early 1700s, Will Chavis, William Chavis.  And my sister [Helen Chavis Othow] also documents--we have built--the answer to the question, we traced our ancestors back to Angola, to the African country, Angola.  There were many slaves bought--as you know, most of the slaves brought from Africa to what's now called America were dropped off in the Caribbean Islands, and then they went to South America.  Many went to South America, but some did, I think 20 percent of the millions of slaves that were taken out of Africa got to America.  And it's very difficult to trace one's roots back, some of it's through names; some of, found out that Chavis is actually a Portuguese name, and in Portuguese and in Spanish it means, Chavis means key.
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit now about your grandparents, starting with your paternal grandparents, your father's [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] parents.  Did you, did you know them?  Did you spend any time with them?
Speaker 2: No, they were deceased by the time I was born.  Keep in mind my father was born in 1889.
Speaker 1: How much older was he--
Speaker 2: He was much older than (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) than your mother [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis]?
Speaker 2: Well, he was about fifteen years older than my mother.
Speaker 1: How did they meet?
Speaker 2: But back in those days, you know, it was people getting married--my mother was I think sixteen when she was married.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.
Speaker 2: And he had just come back from World War I [WWI] and married my mother.  And you know, they lived together for a long time, fifty or sixty years.
Speaker 1: Do you know how they met?
Speaker 2: I'm not sure how they met.  I know that, I do know--I used to tease my mother.  She was sixteen at the time, and obviously he was almost thirty.
Speaker 1: So your mother went to college [North Carolina College for Negroes; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] while she was married?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 2: She went to college after she got married.
Speaker 1: What about your mother's parents?  Did you know them?
Speaker 2: No.  On both sides my grandparents were already deceased by the time I was born.  But I have memories of them through my parents.  On my mother's side, my maternal grandparents were farmers and also landowners.  In fact, the land that we are on right now is really the land on my mother's side, the Ridley family, R-I-D-L-E-Y.  Some of the men on that side were also brick masons.  Brick masonry was a real trade of art back in those days, and men took pride in what they built.  I go to Raleigh [North Carolina] now.  I know some buildings that my relatives, uncles or grandparents were involved in.
Speaker 1: Do you know how your family came about their land?  How it was they were able to own this land?  Has that--do you know that?
Speaker 2: Well, on both sides they worked for it.  Most people farmed their own land.  I'm sure you've heard the stories about sharecroppers, you know, going around farming somebody else's land.  But in Oxford [North Carolina] and Granville County [North Carolina], at least by the time I was born, people in the community owned their own land had their own businesses.  When I tell people, I never, myself, I never saw a white student until my junior year in college [The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina]; I had never even been in a room with a white student.  That's how segregated the community was.
Speaker 1: So did your mother grow up on a farm?
Speaker 2: Well, yes, my mother--we live in a house, the family house that I consider my home place in North Carolina.  It's the same house that my mother grew up in.
Story_ID: 259074
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.], tell me, what is your earliest memory of growing up?  What are like one of the very first things you remember?
Speaker 2: The very things, first things I remember?
Speaker 1: Your earliest memory.
Speaker 2: Well, my earliest memory I guess I may have been three, maybe two.  I still remember my crib.  I mean not crib, but this little thing I used to shake.  I used to, I would always shake this--it's not a crib.  I guess it was a little bed, baby bed.  I was ready to get out of it, and I would shake it in order to get the attention of my parents [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis and Benjamin Chavis, Sr.].  And I can recall them constantly pleading me to stop shaking the bed.  And the more they asked me to stop shaking the bed the more I would shake it, because that was my way of getting their attention.  I remember that.
Story_ID: 259075
Speaker 1: And can you kind of talk a little bit about what holidays were like in your house growing up as a boy.  Were they very special occasions, Christmas, Thanksgiving?
Speaker 2: Most holidays were religious days, Easter, Lent.  My parents [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis and Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] were very religious.  We would always have to fast; you had to give something up.
Speaker 1: What kinds of things did you give up?
Speaker 2: Well, chocolate or sweets.  I was an acolyte.  I used to be an altar boy in the St. Cyprian's Episcopal Church [Oxford, North Carolina].  And of course, I found out that St. Cyprian was a black guy.  I was always concerned.  You know, in all of my answers to your questions, it sounds like I'm giving you always a racial answer.  But you have to understand, my whole existence was trying to decipher what's real and what's not real.  And I was brought up in an Episcopal church.  And again, Oxford [North Carolina] is a little small tobacco plantation town, two Episcopal churches, one for blacks, one for whites.  The white Episcopal church looked like a cathedral.  The black Episcopal church was wooden, although they took care of it.  It was clear, not only class distinction, economic distinction, but racial distinction, always had a white bishop.  And I couldn't understand why at some--no point could the white Episcopal church and a black Episcopal church ever worship together.  That, it was a problem for me.  If we're worshipping the same god, why are we divided on Sunday morning, you know.  And to some extent, growing up, in fact, why I later became a minister, I was probably a little agnostic.  You know, I rejected the idea that black people had been ordained to suffer, there was something wrong with that.
Story_ID: 259076
Speaker 1: Tell us, what was a typical day like for you when you were a boy?  You'd wake up in the morning--
Speaker 2: Well, if it was during the school days, I would wake up early and get ready for school.  I would have to probably go and help my father [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] cut wood or coal, you know.  If it was cold or it was hot, you know, wouldn't have a problem.  But school was very important; never, try never to miss a day out of school.  In the summertime, you know, I was a kid.  I would play, I'd play marbles, and--
Speaker 1: Were you good at marbles?
Speaker 2: Pretty good.  And also baseball was a pastime.  Because of, again, segregation, we had no recreation facilities.  So my mother [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] and father owned some land that they turned into a baseball field.  I don't know if you saw the movie 'Sounder,' where it begins where everybody is.  That's Oxford [North Carolina].  So, in fact, I probably learned how to cuss on the baseball field.  I never knew what cursing words were.  I would--not in my home.  But I learned early what these words were going out to the baseball field, listening to older guys curse.  And because it was taboo, I thought it was something liberating about cursing, you know (laughter).  I later--this is my adolescent understanding.
Speaker 1: I don't think it's changed even now.
Speaker 2: Just like, just like today when doing the hip hop, there's a reason why young people use profanity.  Not to justify it, but sometimes the only way you can rebel is through language, is through thinking what you're not supposed to think about, or speaking in a manner in which the powers that be say you're not supposed to be.
Speaker 1: And what position did you play in baseball?
Speaker 2: Sometimes third base, second base; I could pitch.  In those days, you had to be versatile; you had to do everything, so any position on the baseball field.  And of course, we started out playing baseball with rocks.  We didn't have no ball, yes--
Speaker 1: With rocks?
Speaker 2: Yeah, you'd have a stick and rock.  And sometimes you'd get a rock and wrap it up with tape, tape, and you made a ball.  And then if, you know--I come from a tobacco plantation town, so a lot of times it's a lot of thread left over from wrapping and tying tobacco.  We would get some thread, get a round rock, wrap the thread into almost a perfect ball, and then tape the ball, and you had a ball.
Speaker 1: And did you listen to baseball on the radio as well?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, when I was growing up, we didn't have TVs at that time.  It was a radio.  Not really.
Speaker 1: Just enjoyed playing (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) In my hometown, only thing on the radio was country and western music.  And that, I didn't dig country and western music.
Story_ID: 259077
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about Oxford, North Carolina.  Can--do you remember, did you live on a street or was it a rural route?
Speaker 2: We lived on a street.
Speaker 1: What was the name of your street?
Speaker 2: It had no name.  It was called, well, it was Raleigh Road.  I lived on Raleigh Road--
Speaker 1: And could you kind (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) which was just outside of the city limits of Oxford.  That's why we had our own well.  I remember when we first got an indoor bathroom, that was a big thing.  'Cause you know, I remember the outhouses and how when in the summertime you go to the restroom that was a challenge, 'cause you know, there may be a snake in there or anything.  So, Raleigh Road, but the thing about Raleigh Road, in my community, across the street back in there, black folks owned all the land.  I got to keep emphasizing that.  And so, we went to our own stores, grocery stores.
Speaker 1: Describe the community a little bit for us.  There was a black grocery store.  What else?
Speaker 2: There were several black grocery stores; there were black barbershops; there were black beauty parlors; there was a black pool hall; there was a black juke joint.  There was no intermixing, intermingling with white people.  Oxford is the county seat of Granville County [North Carolina], and Lord Granville [Earl Granville, John Lord Carteret] was one of the eight proprietors who settled North Carolina.  It's in North Carolina history.  But there were Native Americans in my county also.  So when it came time for the public school system, they had three school systems: one for colored people, one for Indians [Native Americans], and one for whites.  And so it's a poor county now, maintaining three distinct school systems.  And so when the school bus would pass, it would be 26I, that's for Indians or 26W, that's for white, or 26C, that's for coloreds.  So you had to wait, waiting on the side for the school, you had make sure you get on the right school bus.  It's crazy.  So, the library in my hometown was segregated.  I never went, in my hometown, I never got a chance to go to the library when I was in elementary school [Angier B. Duke Elementary School, Oxford, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: And I wanna talk about the incident when you were thirteen (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay--(unclear)--
Speaker 1: --but I wanna wait.
Speaker 2: --go back.  Okay, but so, in the swimming pool the--was segregated, the dime store, the movies.  You know, that's--but Oxford--in the middle of town they had this Confederate statue.  And you have to drive around this Confederate statute, and it said, "To our Confederate dead."  And I always wondered why this statue was up in town.  But in a sense, you know, the people in Granville County, in that part of the South, even though I'm growing up there in the 1950s, they, to a certain extent, they were still living in the 1850s.  They were still living in Civil War days, you know.  And in a sense, the agriculture, while my family had corn, tobacco, a little cotton, but not enough.  It was just there, but we raised our vegetables.  I mean, there was a time when everything that we consumed we raised off the land.  And then we would share it with neighbors.  When I was growing up (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Would you like barter different things, like different, did different--
Speaker 2: It wasn't really--
Speaker 1: --people grow different things?
Speaker 2: --a sophisticated barter.  Say, if you had some greens, you gave greens to everybody.  If you had green peas, you'd--field peas, tomatoes, and people would go in your garden.  You know, you'd say, "I'm going to get me some tomatoes, and I'll go," you know.  If somebody needs some sugar they'll just knock on your door.  If you're at home, you're not there, leave a note, "I got some sugar."  Nobody locked their doors.  It was a community.

Speaker 1: Durham [North Carolina] was the big city thirty miles away [from Oxford, North Carolina].  We would go to Durham on Saturdays.  And--
Speaker 2: And what would you be doing (simultaneous)?
Speaker 1: --(Simultaneous) I saw my--I, when I saw a building eight stories, ten stories, I thought that was a skyscraper.  I said, "Oh my God, look at this tall building.  How did they build the building?"  And then of course, North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company was founded in Durham, North Carolina.  And they used to have this part of Durham called Hayti, Little Hayti.  I saw all these, like African markets, back in those days.  And so, my sense of commerce, my sense of business was all internal within the African American community.  It was a self-contained, self-consumed community except for when you had to go to the bank, and that would always be white, or the post office, white folks ran the post office.  You had to mail, and then ice.  You know, sometimes back in those days, people didn't have refrigerators.  They had iceboxes, so you had to wait for the ice man to come.  And we would always--that was always a--when you're a kid, you wait for the ice man 'cause you want some ice, or the ice cream man, or the milkman.  People would deliver milk in those days, jugs of milk.
Speaker 2: Was there any intermingling between the African Americans and the Indians [Native Americans]?
Speaker 1: Yes, but unspoken, you know.  You know, because of the racism, there were some African Americans who, who didn't wanna be African American.  They would pretend they were Indian [Native American], but they were blacks.  But you know, that became, became a way to--because they felt that in the hierarchy there was whites, and even though Indians were scorned, Indians were treated a little bit better than blacks.  Blacks were clearly on the lower end of the totem pole.  And there would always be this time to cause friction between blacks and Indians.  And I remember when television first got into my home I think back maybe around 1953, somewhere around that, I used to root for the Indians.  When I would watch these cowboys and Indians I would always root for the Indians.  I never wanted the cowboys to win.

Speaker 1: Tell me what sights, sounds, and smells remind you of growing up and remind you of your childhood.
Speaker 2: The smell of tobacco.  Not only was tobacco the major crop, but after tobacco is cured--you know how they cure it?  You put it in a smokehouse; you had to cure it.  And then after it's cured, you take it to a warehouse, where it's aged before somebody buys it in big--so, and in and around Oxford [North Carolina] there was always the smell of tobacco, cured tobacco.  Sounds, you know, I lived in a rural community.  I know what crickets sound like, you know.  I can exist in the woods.  My father [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] taught me at a very early age the difference between an oak and a pine, and I can tell you the different leaves.  I know how to identify a poison snake versus a non-poisonous snake.  You know, you learn your environment.  You learn your existence.

Speaker 1: Could you please give us your siblings' names and their birth order?  So who was born first including yourself?
Speaker 2: Okay, you mean my siblings, my sisters?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Okay, I didn't have any brothers--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --just sisters.  My older sister was June Chavis Davenport.  She was fourteen years older than me.  My next sister was one year younger than June.  Her name was Helen Chavis Othow.  I had an adopted sister named Carol Faye Payton [ph.].  And then I have a sister one year younger than me, Dr. [LaRhoda] Francine Chavis.  She's a physician in my hometown of Oxford [North Carolina].
Speaker 1: And you're the youngest?
Speaker 2: Next to the youngest.  My sister who's a physician is the youngest.
Speaker 1: Okay.  Okay, so I'm sorry, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.].  Give it to us one more time.  June--
Speaker 2: June, Helen, Carol Faye, myself, and then Francine.
Speaker 1: Okay, and you said you had an adopted sister.  How did that come about?
Speaker 2: Well, keep in mind the close-knit community.  Her family was experiencing some hard times, and so my mother [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] took her in, I think when she was in the seventh or eighth grade--
Story_ID: 259081
Speaker 1: Let's talk a little bit about elementary school.  You had mentioned earlier that you went to an elementary school at an orphanage.  Can you--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --talk a little bit about that, and tell us the name of the school (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) The name of the school was Angier B. Duke Elementary School [Oxford, North Carolina], which is on the campus of the North Carolina Colored Orphanage [Colored Orphanage of North Carolina; Central Children's Home of North Carolina, Oxford, North Carolina].  My mother [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] taught sixth grade there.  That's where I went to first grade.  Back in those days, there was no such thing as pre-K or kindergarten.  You just went to the first grade when you were six.  And from one through seven I went to school at Angier B. Duke Elementary School.  And 80 percent of my classmates were orphans.  I was "an outside kid."  And because my parents taught there--but there were other outside kids that went there too that walked in the community.  I did not go to the eighth grade.  I went from the seventh grade to the ninth grade.  I skipped the eighth grade.
Speaker 1: What was the environment like there at Angier B. Duke?
Speaker 2: Serious, educational.  The teachers loved teaching, very proud teachers that wanted to make sure that the students knew the information, the academic information.  It was a poor school, but teachers would go out of their way to make sure you knew the parts of speech, the times tables, you know.  I knew how to diagram sentences, you know, when I was in the third grade, fourth grade, all the parts of speech.  We would always learn Negro history in elementary school.  That was very important.  We sang.  You'd get Bible verses in school, prayer in school.  It was always--we'd never start a day without prayer, and the pledge allegiance to the flag, you know.  School was a serious learning environment.  I think, in those days, because I lived in an agricultural community, when it came time to harvest tobacco, they would, the school system would permit blacks to stay out of school while you get the harvest in, and then you catch up.  But there was an appetite, there was a yearning to learn, I would say.  Nobody would just wanna drop out of school or stay out of school, 'cause school was a place to have fun.  Education was fun.
Speaker 1: And did you get a good glimpse into the life of African American orphans?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely.  For nine months out of every year--no, I would say six months out of the year I would not wear shoes, because the orphans could not afford shoes.  And I could not in good conscience go to school with shoes on my feet, and my buddies don't have no shoes.  So it was either a case that we gotta get shoes for everybody, or else I (laughter) can't have shoes, you know.  And I didn't feel, I wanted to be a part of the group.  I didn't want to be the exception.  And so, I learned something about sharing.  Also to be honest, at certain points I didn't think the orphans were treated right--
Speaker 1: How so?
Speaker 2: --so they would run away.  A lot of times I would try to hide 'em in my house.  I would get my mother in trouble, because you're not supposed to hide a runaway orphan, but I had empathy and sympathy.  Sometimes the kids, you know, they wanted to find out--they would be put in orphanages without even told what happened to their parents, why they're in the orphanage.  The diet, what they had to eat.  Again, I'm not knocking them, but I mean it was rough.  I had a balanced meal.  I'm not too sure they had balanced meals.  I bought a lunchbox and always used to share whatever I had in my lunchbox with my partners.
Speaker 1: Who were some of your friends in elementary school?
Speaker 2: Had many, a young brother named Laslow Harris [ph.], Harl Glover [ph.].  My first girlfriend was Lynn Harris [ph.] (laughter).  I had a girlfriend in the first grade.  And I have fond memories, just growing up.
Story_ID: 259082
Speaker 1: What subjects did you enjoy in elementary school [Angier B. Duke Elementary School, Oxford, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I liked to write, so writing, science.  I was inquisitive.  I was pretty good in science.  I was pretty good in all of the subjects, but I guess between science and writing.  And I used to read the newspaper every day.
Speaker 1: What newspaper?
Speaker 2: The Durham Morning Herald [The Herald-Sun] was the daily newspaper.  The Oxford Public Ledger, which was the local newspaper, only came out once a week.  But I remember in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grade everybody had to do current events.  You had to know current events not once, every day, what is happening in the world.  And I would always raise my hand 'cause I liked to read.  I would get the newspaper out of the box in the mornings, and read at least the headlines before my parents [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis and Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] read.  And I started writing editorials when I was in seventh grade, and by the time I got to high school [Mary Potter High School, Oxford, North Carolina] I was editor of our local high school newspaper [Gazette].
Speaker 1: Did you ever submit some of your editorials?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were they ever published?
Speaker 2: Well, in my local high school newspaper yes, they were published.
Speaker 1: No, I meant in elementary school when you started writing them.
Speaker 2: No, they were unpublished.  I just liked to write and also poetry, you know.  I liked to write poetry to capture feelings.
Speaker 1: And what kind of child were you during the elementary school years?
Speaker 2: I was a serious student, but I was also mischievous.  I would get spankings.  I was probably a little rebellious.  But you know, I was very thankful for having a good family, and family was very important to me.  My little sister [Francine Chavis], I used to have to look out for her, you know.
Speaker 1: What was it like growing up in a house with so many girls and women?
Speaker 2: That's right, I was surrounded by--had to always define my masculinity (laughter).  But no, it was cool, it was cool.  I mean even though I would grow up in the house--only other man in the house was my father.  I had to carve out space, but I had a lot of male friends outside, across the street, in the community.  But it was cool.  I mean I enjoyed having big sisters.  They taught me a lot also.  June [Chavis Davenport] was a biology major, my oldest sister, science, so I got a lot of influence of science from her.  And Helen [Chavis Othow] became a student of African American literature and history.  And then my mother had, you know, she was a writer.  My mother wrote everybody's obituaries.  When somebody would die, they would always ask my mother to write, 'cause my mother wrote in these flowery terms.  She would send you off with wings into heaven, you know, writing the obituary.
Speaker 1: Did you have dreams and aspirations when you were in elementary school?  Like, what did you want to be when you grew up?
Speaker 2: I, George--I wanted to be a scientist.  I was impressed by George Washington Carver.  There was sickness I thought--in fact, me and my sister were both were chemistry majors.  We had decided when we were in elementary school we both were gonna be doctors and try to cure people of sickness.  What I dreamed about was, as a young boy, was getting my family in better economic condition, poverty, even though, keep in mind that even though my mother was a teacher, my father was a teacher and brick mason, there were hard times.  I remember some weeks all we would have to eat is cheese, a big round thing of cheese.  And you sliced the cheese, you know, cheese in the morning, cheese in the evening; make grits, grits in the morning, grits, you know.  I like grits to these days and times.  But you become, you know, you learn something about, about life and also about sharing.  'Cause no matter how poor we were, we were always willing to share what we had with others.  There was always somebody less fortunate.  And so my dream was to get out, get a good job, and make some money so my parents wouldn't have to work so hard, you know.
Story_ID: 259083
Speaker 1: I always kind of wanted to grow up fast.  I mentioned I never went to the eighth grade.  I went straight to high school.  I put my age up.  I started driving a car when I was fourteen--somewhat of a daredevil, you know.  And I learned (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) What were some of the daring things you did?
Speaker 1: I used to race cars.
Speaker 2: When you were fourteen?
Speaker 1: Yes, with the lights off at midnight.
Speaker 2: What was that like?
Speaker 1: Well, you wanted to feel what it was like driving fast.  You get adrenaline driving fast, but also I guess you were trying to impress--I was trying to impress my older friends.  Because if I'm fourteen, you know, obviously I'm hanging around with people who were sixteen.  In my hometown [Oxford, North Carolina] you could start driving when you were sixteen.  I just grew up fast.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: And I had good mentors.  Keep in mind, in my (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Who was influencing you?
Speaker 1: My own mother [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] and father [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] were members of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  But you know, they would keep the NAACP card in the drawer.  They wouldn't keep--and I said, "Why are you hiding your membership of NAACP?"  And they said, "Well, one day you will understand."  Because to me, I thought it was a great thing to be a member of the NAACP, so why hide it?  You know, that's--you know.  I became a youth member of the NAACP.  Floyd McKissick was the family lawyer.  He was a founder of the Congress for Racial Equality [sic. Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)].  He put his children into a situation to challenge the segregated schools in Durham, North Carolina.  His own children were spat on and pushed.  I got my first whiff of tear gas when I was in high school.  I--you know, the students at NCC, at North Carolina College [at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] would demonstrate and sit in.  I wanted to be a part of that, you know, and I was a part of it--
Story_ID: 259084
Speaker 1: Let's talk about an incident that occurred when you were thirteen, I believe, at--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --the library.
Speaker 2: Right, twelve actually.
Speaker 1: Twelve?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that.
Speaker 2: One day walking home from school, they had just built a new library called the Richard [H.] Thornton Library [Oxford, North Carolina], glass (unclear).  This is in the early '60s [1960s], '61 [1961] maybe or 1960.  It had to be 1960 'cause I was twelve.  I was born in '48 [1948], so it was 1960.  Prior to that day, when I got the courage to go into this library, all of my classmates, we would always have to go to the colored annex.  And the North Carolina colored annex library was a wooden house next to the First Baptist Church [Oxford, North Carolina].  It's a nice place, full of mainly magazines, some books.  It was clearly not a library we could do a lot of research.  I always wanted to make good grades.  And quite frankly, to be very honest, the motive for going into that library, yes, it was to get a book, but the real motive was, I intended to challenge the authority that said I couldn't go in there.
Speaker 1: So was it kind of spontaneous?  Were you walking by and you said you know (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) No, I had--
Speaker 1: --I'm going in there?
Speaker 2: --thought about it for several days.  I discussed it with my partners.  I said, "Let's do it together; let's go in there as a group."  And they, none of them wanted to.  They said because one, we may go to jail.  We were reading in the newspaper about students being threatened, beat up for challenging authority.  And I need to back up a little bit, because really I don't want anyone to think that one day I just decided to go into this library.  There's much, much more.  You have to understand, by the time I was twelve years old, I knew that I could not go to the movies.  I knew that I could not swim in the local, in the swimming pool.  I knew that I could not even go to the golf course to caddy.  I knew that if I bought something out the five and dime store, I couldn't consume it there.  If I wanted to buy a barbecue sandwich, I had to go around the back door and through a little hole and get the barbecue sandwich.  That stuff wasn't right.  So, you know, I don't want anyone to think that, you know, a bolt of lightning hit me.  No, this is a cumulative anger, despair, and it was--I told my friends earlier, I said, "You know what, after school today, we're going in this library."  And you know how kids are, "Oh, man, you're not going to do that."  I said, "Yes I am.  I want y'all to come with me."  You know how your posse say, "Oh, we're gonna go with you, but we're not going in."  And so I went in.
Story_ID: 259085
Speaker 1: What happened?  Take us back to that day.  What happened?  You pushed the door open, you went in, and what happened?
Speaker 2: Well, I went in.  First of all, we walked up.  We all looked in the glass to see who was in there [Richard H. Thornton Library, Oxford, North Carolina].  The librarian was an elderly white lady, gray hair, wore eyeglasses.  And as soon as I went in, she said, "Young man, can I help you?"  And I said, "Yes, ma'am, I would like to check out a book."  And she says, "Well, you know, you're in the wrong place.  You have to go to the colored annex, next door to the First Baptist Church."  And I said, "No, ma'am, the, all of the books at the colored annex are outdated.  And I would like to get a book that would help me in my class."  And she says, "Well, you're not allowed in the library, number one; number two, you cannot check out a book unless you have a library card."  And I said, "Yes, ma'am, well, what do I have to do to get a library card?"  She says, "Well, I can't give you--you have to have--you have to fill out a form."  I said, "Well, may I have the form?"  She said, "I cannot give you the form."  I said, "I need a form."  I said, "I don't wanna just take a book out of the library.  I don't wanna steal a book.  I wanna get this book out the right way, so please could you give me the form?  I'll fill out the form, and then you can tell me," I was trying to negotiate with her.  I said, "You can tell me later.  I'll come back tomorrow, if the form is filled out right, but at least let me fill out the form."  She says, "I'm calling," and said, "aren't you Elisabeth's son?"  I said, "My mother is Mrs. Elisabeth [Ridley] Chavis."  "Well, isn't she, doesn't she teach in the public school?"  I said, "Yes, ma'am."  She said, "Don't you know you gonna make her lose her job?"  I said, "No, ma'am, I don't want to do anything to hurt my parents."  She says, "Well, if you don't leave this library, I'm gonna call the police, and they're gonna call your parents, and you're gonna make it hard for your parents.  Is this worth it?"  I said, "I don't wanna do anything to hurt my parents, but I'm not leaving the library until you give me the form so I can check out this book."  And by this time, a crowd of my classmates were looking in the glass, you know.  So, she called the police.
Speaker 1: And what happened?
Speaker 2: The police came.  They called my parents.  All this took an hour, about forty-five minutes for the police and my parents to get there.  I stood there patiently.  The police came in and they said, "Nigger, you know you're out of place."
Story_ID: 259526
Speaker 1: What happened next?
Speaker 2: Well, I never looked the police officer straight in the face.  I heard him, but I wasn't responding.  First of all, nigger wasn't my name, you know.  They knew my name.  They knew my family's name, and I wasn't going to even respond.  A few seconds after he said that, my mother [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] and father [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] came in.  My father had a very stern look on his face.  He placed his hand on my shoulder and asked me, "Son, are you all right?"  I said, "Yes, sir."  And he said, "Has anyone bothered you?"  I said, "No, sir."  I said, "I'm just here."  I said "Dad, I was very respectful, and I'm only asking for the right to check out a book."  My mother had tears in her eyes.  She placed her hand on my other shoulder.  She was very nervous.  And she says, "I don't want anything to happen to you."  I said, "Don't worry.  We're gonna be all right."  And the police said to my father and mother, "You need to take your son out of here."  And I guess one of the best days of my life was my mother and father refused to take me out of the library; basically, they stood with me.  The librarian, to her credit, said, "We don't want trouble," and she handed me the blank.  I filled it out.  She looked at it, and she went back in a room and came back, wrote my name on a little, and gave me my card right there.  All my partners that were looking in the window started clapping.  They came in, filled out their application, got their card, and we went and got us some books.  We were so happy.  We, that day, we didn't check out books.  We just got the books off the shelf, got the first books we could find (laughter) to sit down inside of the Richard B. Thornton Library [sic. Richard H. Thornton Library, Oxford, North Carolina], stayed there for about thirty minutes.  You know, we didn't want to overdo it.  I thanked the librarian.  We all left.
Story_ID: 259527
Speaker 1: Now, when we got home, the phone was ringing off the hook of people calling, cursing whoever, cursing my family, whoever would answer the phone would be cursed out.
Speaker 2: White people were calling?
Speaker 1: Yes.  Back in those days, they had something called a party line.  You didn't have a single line.  I mean we had a line, but there were two other white people on our line.  It wasn't the people who were on the line, but they knew our number in other words, and yeah, you know, very vulgar language, saying what they were gonna do, better leave, not gonna have this in Oxford [North Carolina], you know.  So, that evening, that night, I was very happy.  I made out a little list of other places that need to be challenged: the dime store, the movies.  'Cause what you've learned, you don't want a little bit of freedom, you know.  And what I--it taught me a lesson at twelve years old: if you stand up to injustice, at least you have a chance to change it, but if you don't stand up, it's never gonna change, gotta stand up.  And it made me think.  I was a little kind of concerned maybe I should have done that when I was six years old, you know.  I figured out if it, not that it was just that easy, but it was difficult.  I'm not--I don't want anyone looking at this to think that that was something easy to do.  But the next day I did come back and actually checked out the book and made it a pattern every day, whether I needed a book or not, I would go in that [Richard H. Thornton] Library [Oxford, North Carolina] every day after school.
Speaker 2: Did your parents [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis and Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] suffer any repercussions because of that?
Speaker 1: My father--it was talked about in the barbershop, but he never told me what the discussion was.  The next day, I remember in the barbershop very vividly when we were coming out of the barbershop, some plainclothes policemen were beating another man, a man, a black man.  And for the first time in my life I heard the sound of a blackjack hitting a human skull.  It's an awful sound.  And my father said, "Son, let's go."  I said, "Daddy, let, let's help him."  And he said, "Son, they wanted to do that to you for going in their library.  Let's go before they recognize you."  I really didn't wanna go, but I followed my father's advice.  I didn't know what the guy had done.  I don't know.  We came out of the barbershop just in time when I heard this guy.  It was a little, he had a little short, I guess it's called a black stick.  But that thing hit the black man's head.  It's like in baseball when you hit a ball there's a certain sound, but this was a skull.  And I don't ever wanna hear that sound, because to me they could have brain damaged that guy.  And guys were joking, saying it was no big thing, you know, so.  And then all the men in the barbershop saw it, and nobody came out to help.  I, that's the thing that I don't like.  I think our level of tolerance is too high, you know.  I think we tolerate too many injustices.  I think we tolerate too many inflictions of hurt and pain on our people till it almost becomes commonplace; it almost becomes normal.  I don't--that's, to me that's abnormal.  And so, yeah, I was--I'm still salivating at the victory of going in the library, but I understood clearly that was just the tip of the iceberg.
Speaker 2: Right, there's a long road ahead.
Speaker 1: Oh, no question.
Story_ID: 259528
Speaker 1: Let's talk about high school.  What was the name of the high school you attended?
Speaker 2: The first high school I went to was up in the mountains.  Keep in mind, I went from Angier B. Duke Elementary School in Oxford, North Carolina, to Lenoir, North Carolina, up in the mountains of North Carolina, where my sister, June Chavis Davenport, and her husband, Marvin Davenport, taught school.  So my first high school was Freedman High School [Lenoir, North Carolina].  I liked the name of that, Freedman High School.
Speaker 1: Now did you live with your sister and her husband while you were there?
Speaker 2: I lived, yes.  And keep in mind, the reason why my parents [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis and Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] sent me to live with my sister and my brother-in-law is because I was very mischievous, and I think for my own safety.  My parents felt that something was going to happen to me if I didn't at least spend a year outside of Oxford.  'Cause sure enough, when they put me on the bus to go to Lenoir in Durham [North Carolina]--I got on the bus in Durham--the driver told me to go to the back of the bus.  I was getting ready to have a problem, even before I got to Lenoir.  But I didn't wanna start an incident.  I went to the back of the bus, but I knew clearly that that was wrong by then, this is in the 1960s, to tell me to go to the back of the bus after all that we went through, been on in Alabama.  I knew the bus driver didn't think I knew better.  But the only reason why I didn't challenge that bus driver was for the sake of my parents putting me on a bus to go to safety.  I would have never made it out of the bus depot.  So, I went to school at Freedman High School.
Speaker 1: For one year?
Speaker 2: For one year.
Story_ID: 259529
Speaker 1: Then I came back my sophomore year at Mary Potter High School [Oxford, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Mary--could you spell that please?
Speaker 1: M-A-R-Y, Potter, P-O-T-T-E-R, High School.
Speaker 2: And what were your experiences like there?
Speaker 1: In Mary Potter High School?
Speaker 2: Um-hm.
Speaker 1: Well, I became a young man.
Speaker 2: What kind of young man were you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Keep in mind--
Speaker 2: --becoming?
Speaker 1: --keep in mind, I was in the tenth grade.  I got my driver's license, put my age up; I took the test, passed the test--you get a learner's permit in other words.  I joined the football team.  And keep in mind, because I was, had skipped eighth grade, I was around people older than me.  So I had to kind of accelerate my maturity as a young man.  I had girlfriends.  I started dating, respectfully.  And because I had my driver's license, I would always go to Durham [North Carolina].  I would hang around with North Carolina Central College [North Carolina College at Durham; North Carolina Central University, Durham, North Carolina] students.  I wanted to find out about the [Civil Rights] Movement, what was going on.
Speaker 2: And what were you finding out about the movement?
Speaker 1: There was a sense of urgency.  You know, the sit-ins had started in Greensboro [North Carolina] at A&T [Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina; North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: The sit-ins had started in Durham.  It was a Woolworth's in Greensboro.  There was a place called Kresge dime store in Durham.  What I sensed was, young students, primarily college students, but some high school, but primary college students were demanding change now.  And I wanted to be a part of that.  In Raleigh [North Carolina] students from Shaw University [Raleigh, North Carolina], from St. Augustine's College [St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] were staging protests.  I found it very healthy.  Also, this is like, the Vietnam War was getting heated up.  I started writing for the high school newspaper, the Mary Potter Gazette.  I was editorial writer.  I was writing editorials against the Vietnam War, and I was in the sophomore year of high school.  And we had to go to the Oxford Public Ledger printer to print our paper.
Speaker 2: And that was the hometown paper--
Speaker 1: Hometown paper--
Speaker 2: --the local paper.
Speaker 1: And the owner of the newspaper couldn't believe, 'cause I was in Mrs. McGee [ph.], that was my English teacher, she was--couldn't believe that a tenth grader was writing, 'cause I sometimes had to write the copy right before it goes to press, 'cause you know, filler, you had to get fillers and the spacing.  And I was also doing all the headlines.  And you have to do a headline that's kind of catchy.  And the guy said, "How old are you?"  I said, "I'm, you know, thirteen."  He said, "Who taught you to write like that?"  I said, "I had good teachers," you know.  I said, "You wanna give me a job?  I could write for the Oxford Public Ledger."  But, so high school was a time of maturity for me.  Keep in mind, in the early '60s [1960s] also was when the Sputnik went up.  So it was this whole--in America, everybody was grappling with science and math.  So I developed an interest into chemistry.  I had a very good chemistry teacher, Mr. Tyler [ph.].  And I used to help my classmates with their experiments.  I would do my experiment.  They couldn't do their experiments, so I would help everybody do their experiments.

Speaker 1: You had talked a little bit about your writing and journalism.  Were you thinking that perhaps you wanted to pursue a career in journalism?  What were your thoughts about journalism when you were in high school [Mary Potter High School, Oxford, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Well, my thoughts about journalism, I felt that more needed to be written.  I actually went over to The Carolinian newspaper.  That was the black newspaper in Durham [sic. Raleigh, North Carolina], and submitted several articles which were published when I was in high school.  And of course later in life, I developed my own column called, Civil Rights Journal, which appeared in all the black newspapers across the country.  That's later on.  But I had my beginnings of wanting to be a journalist, mainly an editorial writer.  And, you know, there are different forms of writing.  I liked to write satires.  I was a very good satirical writer, you know, where you take exception, but you do it skillfully.  You lead people the deduction that something is wrong.  You may start out acting like you support it.  Like I would write about [the] Vietnam [War] maybe from a perspective of an American soldier or the child of an American soldier, but raise contradictions about, what about the lives of the children on the other side, you know?
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And I didn't like the fact that there were taking, there was a draft.  Everybody was afraid of the draft--better do good or else you're gonna get drafted.  And then I saw the local draft board take young men out of college, and they should have got a 2S student deferment.  They didn't get the student deferment.  They went straight to the war.  Out of my high school class there were numerous funerals.  I lost a lot of my high school classmates, who got killed in the Vietnam War.  So, you know, I became somewhat of a conscientious objector.  I didn't, the draft board never drafted me.  I guess they probably thought I was too militant, 'cause I had a big afro in high school.
Speaker 1: So you were a little before your time.
Speaker 2: Somewhat.  Well, I would say I was on time (laughter).  You know, I was part of the young student militants.  What I mean by militant, militant thinking, militant dreaming.
Speaker 1: And were you feeling that sense of urgency yourself?  You said you sensed it, like when you would go to various colleges and visit.  When you were in high school, were you starting to feel it?
Speaker 2: I was starting to feel it.  But also keep in mind, because of the way I was raised, the term black was still a bad term.  If you called somebody black, they would want to fight you, because it was considered a derogatory term, you know.  If you told a black lie, that's a bad lie.  You told a little white lie, not so bad.  People dressed in black for funerals.  For weddings they dress in white.  Angel food cake is black--I mean angel food cakes, angel food cakes is white.  Devil's food cake is black.  A black cat walk across your path, you have to--that's bad luck, so, this whole conception.  And keep in mind, I was brought up in a colored school system; everything was colored.  People were referred to as a Negro with a capital 'N' and a nigger with a small 'n,' you know.  And then there's this whole distinction between nigger and nigga.  That's a later thing.  But what--who were we?  Where did we come from?  How did we get into this predicament, you know?  Why were--these were questions.  I guess, to be more accurate, I came of age questioning.  I didn't know the answers, but I wanted to ask the right questions.
Story_ID: 259531
Speaker 1: What year did you graduate from high school [Mary Potter High School, Oxford, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: I graduated from high school in 1965.
Speaker 1: And when you were in high school, what were some of your thoughts about college?
Speaker 2: Well, I already knew where I was going.  I went to St. Augustine's College [St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], the Episcopal school.  It's where my father [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] went and where all of my sisters went.  My father and [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis' father were classmates at St. Augustine's College.  He was an Episcopalian, and his name is Franklin Davis.  So I knew I was going to St. Augustine's College.  That was predestined.
Speaker 1: What did you think that you wanted (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And I was a chemistry major.
Speaker 1: Okay and so where you still thinking that you wanted to perhaps be a scientist or a doctor?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: When you went to college?
Speaker 2: Yes, I was--that's why I majored in chemistry.  I went to St. Augustine's College to major in chemistry.  My sister [Francine Chavis], who was one year younger than me, she was the valedictorian of her high school class.  She had a scholarship to UNC at Greensboro [The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, North Carolina] also as a chemistry major.  So we knew where we were gonna go.  But I started volunteering in my freshman year in college.  This is '65 [1965].  I joined, I became a volunteer staff person for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC].  I worked under a man named Golden Frinks.  He was the state field secretary of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  Golden Frinks really--I love him to this day--he taught me how to organize.  I mean I knew a little something about movement building, but by the time I got to college, it was about organizing resistance.
Story_ID: 259532
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that.  How do you organize?  What's the difference?
Speaker 2: Well, organized resistance is when you have to get people involved.  It's just not an individual effort.  When I was in high school or elementary school [Angier B. Duke Elementary School, Oxford, North Carolina] I was doing things more as an individual.  But when you're building a movement, you have to enlist people of various walks in life.  And you have to get people who are the most aggrieved to have the courage to stand up, and then give them protection as they stand up.  The movement has to be--facilitate people's power.  And one of the things you learn is that there's always a precipitating incident.  It can be some act of police brutality, some injustice.  A lot of times when the National Guard would spray tear gas on college students, for some of the students who really cried their eyes out, this would be somewhat of a baptism, you know, that you learn how to withstand the hurt of it, the temporary hurt of it for the greater good.  And so, in 19--between 1965 and 1968, I became the youth coordinator for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC].  Keep in mind, I was all, already a member of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] back in Oxford [North Carolina] as a youth.  But organized resistance was first through SCLC.
Speaker 1: So, that's what I wanted to ask you.  What were you--what did you see as the differences between the NAACP and SCLC?
Speaker 2: The NAACP was an advocacy group that channeled racial inequity, racial injustice primarily through the courts, but by the fact of merely having meetings.  You have to understand, in those days, to have a meeting, just a meeting, is an, almost a revolutionary act, to carry a card, to be a card carrying member.  So, the NAACP had these branches.  And the fact that they had regular meetings, the fact that they had discussions, that was the role of the NAACP.  SCLC was more confrontational of racial injustice, the authority of racial injustice, particularly after there was an incident.  And Golden Frinks was a master at finding situations not only that would make black people mad, but would make black people mad enough to stand up.  And it was our role that once black people in some community got to that stage, to not only encourage them to be angry, no, but to translate your anger into some effective modus operandi that could effectuate change.  That's what I learned from SCLC and a lot of it marching.  Put your marching shoes on.  I've been in a lot of marches, sometimes very small marches, sometimes just marching down the street of a neighborhood, sometimes it's marching out of class, sometimes it's marching into a situation, but it's marching, and also the music, the freedom songs, the role of music - 'This Little Light of Mine,' I'm gonna let it shine all over Oxford, I'm gonna let it shine all over Durham [North Carolina], all over Raleigh [North Carolina], all over Greensboro [North Carolina], all over Charlotte [North Carolina], all over Wilmington [North Carolina].  That became a favorite song of mine, 'This Little Light of Mine,' I'm gonna let it shine.

Speaker 1: What were your parents [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis and Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] thinking about your civil rights activities when you were at St. Aug [St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina]?
Speaker 2: Cautious.  In my first year of--I was driving to school, to college, and between Raleigh [North Carolina] and Oxford [North Carolina] I had to go through Franklin County [North Carolina] as well as Wake County [North Carolina].  I had to go through some Ku Klux Klan [KKK] territory.  So my father would always tell me to be careful.  Make sure that I have plenty of gas in the car.  And I learned all the back roads.  One thing about that situation, you have to know your terrain, you know.  And my father died in 1965, and that was a very traumatic moment for him.  I'm glad he lived to see me enrolled in the school that he went.  He was very happy about that.  And on the day my father had a stroke, I happened to be at home that morning.  I remember hugging him and kissing him, and I was just thankful that I--my father was proud of his son.  And he would always write me notes, some which I have to this day, about very simple things.  My father would tell me, "Be the best at whatever you're gonna do.  If you're gonna be ditch digger, be the best ditch digger there is."  He taught me how to lay bricks, which I didn't go into, when I was four years old.  If I lost every job I had, I could always go back, to this day, and lay a roll of bricks straight, because one should always know how to work with your mind, but you also have to use your hands.  And I'm very grateful to have had a father like the father I had.  And during my whole time living with my mother and father I never heard them argue once.  I know they must have argued, but they didn't argue in front of the kids.  'Cause I would ask him one time.  I said dad, what--I never hear you.  He said we--he tried to tell me they never argued, but I know there were some disagreements sometimes.  But out of respect for the kids, my parents never showed me or my sisters any point of contention.  And so I grew up with a very wholesome concept of what family is all about, what being a provider to one's family is all about, taking care of family business, and showing respect to one's spouse.
Story_ID: 259534
Speaker 1: You said by 1968 you were the youth coordinator for SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference].  And let's talk about (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, actually, by 1965.
Speaker 1: Nineteen sixty-five [1965].  Well--
Speaker 2: 'Cause [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed in '68 [1968].
Speaker 1: Right, that's what I wanna talk about.  You--
Speaker 2: That was devastating.
Speaker 1: Yeah.  Tell me a little bit about when you got the news that Dr. King had been assassinated.
Speaker 2: Okay, Dr. King was killed (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) 'Cause the next day--
Speaker 2: --on April 4th, 1968, when he was in Memphis, Tennessee.  I had started working for SCLC in 1965, so I was a three-year staff person by the time he was killed.  And in fact, on April the 5th and through the 6th and 7th he was supposed to be in Charlotte, North Carolina.  So I was in Charlotte preparing for Dr. King to leave Memphis to come to Charlotte.  A dentist, Dr. Reginald Hawkins, had announced his candidacy for governor of North Carolina.
Speaker 1: African American dentist?
Speaker 2: African American dentist.  It was a big precedent-setting thing.  And of course, there had been several bombings, black law offices, homes, civil rights leaders bombed in Charlotte.  And so it was--and also, by 1968, I was working with AFSCME, the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, a labor union.  Because when Dr. King went to Memphis it was because of AFSCME.  It was a labor strike.  There was a sanitation strike.  And we were going to Memphis, Southern Christian Leadership Conference, to show our solidarity for the workers that were on strike.  We had a similar strike building in Charlotte.  So, you know, I have to emphasize there was a close coalition between organized labor and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, SCLC.  The day that Dr. King was killed I was devastated.  I was a junior, advanced junior at [The] University of North Carolina at Charlotte [Charlotte, North Carolina], so I was on my college campus when I heard it on the news flash that he'd been shot first that afternoon.  And I got into my car and went home, kept constant radio.  I called Golden Frinks, the state field secretary, to see if he had heard anything, and he confirmed that he had been shot, but everybody was praying that even though he had been shot that he would live.  There was just no conception in the [Civil Rights] Movement at that time of not having Dr. King.  Dr. King was unquestionably the leader, the visionary, the voice, the spirit of our struggle.  And being a nonviolent man, everybody said how could this happen to Dr. King.  So, by six o'clock that day, news came that he, in fact, had been killed, I mean assassinated.  And in Charlotte and some other cities in North Carolina violence broke out that evening as well as many cities around the country, on fire.  I met with my colleagues at Southern Christian Leadership Conference.  We didn't know whether to drive to Memphis, or to go to Atlanta [Georgia], or stay in North Carolina.  We decided to stay in North Carolina, that we felt it was very important to keep Dr. King's dream alive even in the wake of his death, not allow the assassin's bullet to assassinate the movement that Dr. King built, not to allow this tragic assassination to kill the spirit, our sense of determination.  There's another I wanna say about SCLC, as well as the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], as well as CORE, Congress of Racial Equality, to be openly involved with those organizations was a sense of defiance.  And it was important not to retreat in the face of death, in the face of injustice, in the face of hardship.  So it was--but to be very honest, I cried; I shed tears.  And as a young black man back in those days, you tried not to ever cry.  I tried to hold back tears when my father [Benjamin Chavis, Sr.] died in '65 [1965].  I cried.  And our assembly cried when I learned that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. had been assassinated in Memphis.  And I was crying not only for myself but crying for the movement, for the aspirations.  You know, it's one thing to get people to aspire, to demand freedom, particularly after many decades of no demand for freedom, no organized demand for freedom, just acceptance of comme ci comme ca.  So, '68 [1968] was a turning point.
Story_ID: 259535
Speaker 1: Also that same year [1968], [Senator] Robert [F.] Kennedy was running for president.  I was working as a volunteer for Robert Kennedy's campaign.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was killed in April.  Robert Kennedy was killed in June, California, again, another assassination, so I had to deal with two assassinations.  And all this, you know, you run through your mind, is this--do you really wanna be involved in this movement?  Is this how this is gonna turn out?  But you have to always override and overcome those fears.
Speaker 2: And how did you do that?  Because how were you coping with all of this loss?
Speaker 1: By keeping busy.  Again, the Vietnam War resistance was growing.  I was leading marches by then against the Vietnam War.  I was dabbling in the wake of Dr. King's tragic assassination.  I wanted to be more militant, so I started spending time with people who were in the Black Panther Party.
Speaker 2: And so, this is around 1968?
Speaker 1: It was in 1968.
Speaker 2: So the whole nonviolent concept, were you starting to disassociate (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) I--
Speaker 2: --yourself with that?
Speaker 1: No, I believed in nonviolent civil disobedience as a strategy.  But very honestly, after Dr. King was killed, I went out and bought a gun.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: I was gonna protect my family, and I was not going out like that, you know.  I believed in self-defense, nonviolent.  But if you be violent to me or my family, I'm gonna defend myself.
Speaker 2: And what were you finding in the Black Panther Party--
Speaker 1: Well, what I found was some young brothers who believed in self-defense.  That appealed to me, given my history.  I wanted to see black people resist, but I wanted to do it in an organized way.  The Panthers were so infiltrated.  By this time you had J. Edgar Hoover, the COINTELPRO [Counterintelligence Program], so you really didn't know who was who.  Everybody who said they was a Panther really was not a Panther.  Everybody who said they was in the movement really was not in the movement.  So, when I say I dabbled with it, I was very cautious.  And keep in mind, '68 [1968] also was an evolution of the cultural movement.  What I mean by cultural, people becoming more sense of what it meant to be a Pan-Africanist as well as a nationalist, you know.  It's interesting, the Panthers were integrationist.  The Black Panther Party had integrated itself with the peace movement.  And most people don't--if you go back and study their history, yes.
Speaker 2: Elaborate on that a little bit.
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of the Panthers, with all due respect, had white girlfriends.  So, and it was this clash of ideology.  I mean were you gonna be a socialist?  Were you gonna be a communist?  Were you gonna be a nationalist?  Were you gonna be a Pan-Africanist?  Were you gonna be an integrationist?  Were you gonna be a separatist?  I mean all these things.
Speaker 2: So you think--
Speaker 1: And I was grappling in my own life.  And to be very honest with you, coming out of the church, coming out of the movement, having worked under the banner of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the epitome of nonviolent social change, and I'm a college student now [at The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina]--not just a student, really, I've become almost a student leader in the community.  Because for me, by then, education wasn't just in the classroom; it was in the street, and I had to identify with what was happening in the street.  And what was happening in the street of Charlotte, North Carolina, which was the largest city in North Carolina at the time, were a lot of not only young people asking question but trying to find the right way, you know.  All of a sudden Houston [Texas] became very important.  What was going on in Africa became very important.  What was going on in the Caribbean became very important, Cuba became very important, you know.  And so, there was no readymade revolution for black people.  I became very close friends with Stokely Carmichael.  In fact, I brought Stokely, who later became Kwame Ture, but at the time he was still called Stokely Carmichael.  I remember I was the president of an organization on campus called Students for Action, UNCC Students for Action.  There would not let us have a black student union.  It really was the black student union, but we called it UNCC Students for Action, so we invited Stokely to speak.  One of the greatest speeches I ever heard when Stokely came on our campus.  I was proud to host him.
Story_ID: 259536
Speaker 1: And later that night I drove him [Stokely Carmichael; Kwame Ture] to A&T [North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro, North Carolina], where he spoke.  And this was after the Orangeburg [South Carolina] massacre.  This was after the students' uprisings in several of the historically black colleges and universities [HBCUs] where students paid their lives, gave up their lives to advance the struggle.  And at the time, Stoke (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Were you willing to do that--
Speaker 1: Yes, I--
Speaker 2: --at that time?
Speaker 1: Be very honest, yes, I was willing to give up my life, but I was, I wasn't gonna give up my life without taking somebody else's life with me.  I was not, I didn't wanna be no martyr, no.  I didn't have no martyr complex.  I wanted to live.  But did I mind risking my life?  No, I didn't mind risking my life, but it was, believe me, it was a calculated risk, you know.  For, for a point in time, from '68 [1968] to 1970, I primarily was armed.  I went to class armed, because I had to protect myself.
Speaker 2: Was there still a sense of fear, or did that help eradicate the fear?
Speaker 1: It wasn't out of fear.
Speaker 2: It wasn't?
Speaker 1: It was just like knowing what the deal is.  I didn't become armed, an armed militant, and I know this is on film, but I'm just gonna tell you the truth, because out of fear.  You know what it's out?  By the time--keep in mind, I'm married.
Speaker 2: When did you get married?
Speaker 1: I got married in 1960--I got married January 31st, 1965, I mean December 31st, 1965.  During my freshman year in college [at St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina], my high school girlfriend was pregnant by me.  And where I come from, you get a sister pregnant you going to the altar.  I had no reluctance.  I loved her, and we got married.  So, keep in mind, I'm married.  I have a child; by '68 [1968] I have two children.  I have to work, obviously worked my way through school.  I sold shoes at Butler's shoes store.  In the evening and in the morning I was a short order cook at a black-owned restaurant.
Speaker 2: When did you find time for the movement?
Speaker 1: All between time, the movement, I was--when people come in and buy some breakfast, I was talking about the movement.  When I was selling sisters shoes, I'm talking about the movement.  The movement became my life.  Education was still very important.  I wanted to finish my college degree so I could make more money, take care of my family.  But the point I'm trying to say is that I, out of love for my family and out of love for the movement, I knew that the movement needed to protect itself, and I had to protect myself.  I wasn't gonna expose myself to danger without a situation where I could defend myself.  I really believed in self-defense--
Story_ID: 259537
Speaker 1: I wanna go back for a second, 'cause one thing I wanna ask you about, when you said that the Black Panthers [Black Panther Party] were integrationist, because (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Well, I didn't know that at the time, but I'm saying that's, that's what I found out.
Speaker 1: But do you think that just by having a white girlfriend that makes you an integrationist--
Speaker 2: Well, it wasn't just about having a white girlfriend.  I mean if you read their platform, the Ten-Point Program of the Black Panther Party, it was a universal platform.  And when you view the role of Jane Fonda and others when they helped start the breakfast program, I mean there was a socialistic underpinning to what the Black Panther Party was trying to do.
Speaker 1: Was it a turnoff at all (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they had a coalition with SDS, Students for a Democratic Society, SDS, which was a radical underground white group.  All this, to be "radical" was the common denominator, whether you're in the Panthers, whether you're in the SDS, the Weather Underground [Organization], had a lot of different groups in the '60s [1960s].  Keep in mind, '68 [1968] was also the year that at Chicago [Illinois] Democratic [National] Convention when [Mayor Richard J.] Daley, you know, beat all those heads up.  And later that year what did we do?  We elect Richard [Milhous] Nixon and Spiro Agnew as [president and vice] president, and they ran on a law and order campaign.  Sixty-eight [1968] was a very transitional year.  A lot of people had to decide very quickly, who are you, what do you stand for, what is your identify, and where you're going.  And you could not dance around these issues.  You had to, if you were gonna be in the forefront of the story, you had to answer those issues, then some say you have to practice what you preach.
Speaker 1: Okay, let's--
Speaker 2: So when I say they were integrationist, I know it sort of shocked you.  It's not a question of being integrationists versus separatists.  It's a question of what is the methodology of social change.  Do you build a coalition?  Do you try to do it alone?  Do you use the tactics of the oppressor to get rid of the oppression?  All these things, you know.  I think [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] was successful because he had a strategy that proved to be effective, nonviolent social change.  The truth of the matter is you could not outshoot the oppressor, so just getting guns is not the solution, you know.  We have to outthink the oppressor.  We have to become better educated.  We have to out-strategize, outmaneuver, you know.  And the oppressed should never aspire to take the place of the oppressor.  Because once you decide to take the place of the oppressor, then you become an oppressor to your own people.
Story_ID: 259538
Speaker 1: Let's talk about, believe it was 1970, when you were charged with the arson.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Was that 1970?
Speaker 2: Yeah, yes, a little point of evolution here.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the end of the day, in 1968, I decided to answer God's calling to the ministry.  I had tried everything, you know.  I was a militant.  I dabbled with the Panthers [Black Panther Party].  I dabbled with the cultural nationalists.  I used to wear the dashikis, you know.  And I basically, I was running from God.  I didn't want to be no minister, 'cause I thought being a minister was too conservative, to complacent, but a calling is a calling.  And in truth, I saw firsthand how [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] used his ministry for positive, constructive social change.  So I answered the call to the ministry, but I answered the call to the ministry still in the vein of where my head was.  So, I became a staff person of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice.  [Reverend] Dr. Charles Earl Cobb, Sr. is one of my mentors.  Reverend Leon [H.] White, Reverend Dr. William Thomas [ph.], Reverend Dr. Edwin [R.] Edmonds, these men helped me understand what a calling to the ministry is and how to answer the call.  A very famous man, Dr. Albert [B.] Cleage [Jr.], who founded the Shrine of the Black Madonna [Detroit, Michigan], friend of Malcolm's [Malcolm X] in Detroit [Michigan], was a United Church of Christ minister.  So I first was ordained as a Black Christian Nationalist Minister, BCSM [ph.].  I don't know if you know much about Albert Cleage and the Black Christian Nationalists, yeah.  It's a good book he wrote, 'The Black Messiah.'  And in any event, while I was on track to be a United Church of Christ minister, I started out as a sort of a black nationalist in the United Church of Christ and--
Speaker 1: And how (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) went back to school.  'Cause I still was completing my chemistry degree at [The] University of North Carolina at Charlotte [Charlotte, North Carolina], but I also enrolled into--
Speaker 1: When did you leave St. Aug [St. Augustine's College; St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] to go to--
Speaker 2: Okay, I left--I was at St. Aug from 1965 to 1966.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Then I transferred to The University of North Carolina at Charlotte in 1967.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So from 1967 forward till 1969 was when I completed my studies at University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
Speaker 1: And you got your degree--
Speaker 2: Degree in chemistry.
Speaker 1: --in chemistry.
Speaker 2: Undergraduate degree in chemistry.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: At the same time I enrolled into the United Church of Christ in-service ministerial training program in New York [New York].  Basically, I had to go back to school to learn how to become a minister.  And then in 1969, while I was transitioning to being a minister, I went back home to my Oxford [North Carolina] and taught high school for a half semester.  This would have been in the spring of 1969.  And then in the spring of 1969 the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] killed one of my high school classmates named Henry Marrow, M-A-R-R-O-W.  And then I got a chance to come back to my own hometown and apply everything that I had learned in the movement and other places.  I led major civil rights demonstrations.
Speaker 1: In Oxford?
Speaker 2: In Oxford, my hometown.  You know, a prophet is not without honor except at home, so most people don't do that in their own hometown.  I went back to my own hometown, built a movement, led a boycott of all the downtown businesses, because it was clear that the establishment in Oxford was supporting the Teel family that had murdered unjustly this unarmed young black man who had just come back from the Vietnam War and murdered him because they say he whistled at his wife, very similar to what happened to Emmett Till.  So I was not about to let that go down in my own hometown without a response.
Speaker 1: And were you finding that the blacks in Oxford, were they scared?  Were they receptive?  Were they outraged or, what--
Speaker 2: They, they were much more receptive.  They were a little scared, but they had somebody now that was willing to stand up for them.  I mean I was a young adult.  You know, I was still 19, 20 years old.
Speaker 1: And they, they trusted you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  And we organized a very effective movement.
Speaker 1: But how is that setting with the whites in Oxford?  'Cause I'm sure many of them remembered you for as that--
Speaker 2: They--
Speaker 1: --twelve-year-old boy--
Speaker 2: --they remembered me.
Speaker 1: --started that trouble at the [Robert H. Thornton] Library [Oxford, North Carolina].
Speaker 2: Right.  I guess it was a sad day to them when I returned home, because I returned home even more militant, even more determined.  I had a lot of experience by then.  I knew how to organize.  We led marches in Oxford.  We led a very effective economic boycott of all the downtown businesses, even when they had the fair, country fairs.  That's when everybody'd go spend their money, harvest time.  Nobody went to the fair.  That's unheard of, black folks not going to the amusement park.  So, yes, we had built a very effective movement.
Story_ID: 259539
Speaker 1: So I started marching in Oxford [North Carolina].  I started marching in Henderson [North Carolina].  I started marching in Warrenton [North Carolina].  These are different towns.  All over North Carolina I was marching.  That's what led me to go to Wilmington [North Carolina].  I wanted to give you that background.  It's just I didn't show up in Wilmington, North Carolina.
Speaker 2: No, sure.
Speaker 1: The major struggles in North Carolina were over school desegregation.  It was not till the early '70s [1970s] that most school districts in North Carolina finally desegregated.  And they only desegregated under court ordered desegregation, because after the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] filed various suits, the court, federal court ordered these schools to be desegregated, these county school systems, such was the case in Wilmington, North Carolina, New Hanover County [North Carolina].  I was sent to Wilmington by the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice.  By then I'd become a United Church of Christ minister.  I was a southern regional organizer for the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice.  And I was sent into Wilmington in February of 1971.  And by the time I got to Wilmington, there was serious racial polarization around the desegregation of the schools.  Michael Jordan, the great basketball player, is from Wilmington, North Carolina.  In 1971 he was in junior high school.  He was one of the little kids we were fighting to get the right to be able to go to The University of North Carolina [at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina] where he later went and became a professional basketball player.  So, but keep in mind now, by 1971, I was a veteran of a lot of other community struggles, so I knew what I was doing.  I went down, we organized, we staged protests, but the [Ku Klux] Klan [KKK] by that time had also become a little bit more sophisticated.  They had a group, a paramilitary white supremacist group called the ROWP, stands for the Rights of White People organization.  And most of them were ex-Marines from Camp Lejeune Marine Base [Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune] in Jacksonville, North Carolina.  And so, where the Klan used to burn crosses and try to scare people, these people were not burning crosses.  They were shooting real bullets, automatic weapons.  We were working in Gregory Congregational United Church of Christ [Wilmington, North Carolina] church.  The ROWP came over and shot up the church, wounded several people.  I went down, asked the police chief, whose name was [A.E.] Williamson, I said, "Look, [President Richard Milhous] Nixon is president, J. Edgar Hoover talking about law and order.  We want some law and order.  We want police protection in our community.  We want police protection for our church and our community."  They refused to give us police protection, so we decided, all right, if the Klan comes back, we're gonna defend ourselves, and that's what we did.
Speaker 2: Did they come back?
Speaker 1: They came back, and we defended ourselves.
Speaker 2: But--
Speaker 1: And because we defended ourselves, that's--one year later, in March of 1972, they came and arrested myself and fifteen other people.  At first it was the Wilmington Sixteen.  Of the original sixteen people arrested, they brought ten to trial.  And that's how we became known as the Wilmington Ten (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) And they arrested you for what?
Speaker 1: Conspiracy charges, conspiracy to riot, conspiracy to arson, conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to assault emergency personnel.  Because during the riot in 1971, several people were killed; millions of dollars' worth of property was burned up.  It was a riot.  They said that what we did in the church, planned the riot and caused the riot, which is crazy.  They were shooting at us. We were not in anybody's community messing with anybody.  So--
Speaker 2: So (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: --(simultaneous) it took us ten years to prove our innocence of these charges.
Speaker 2: But, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.], just to back up.  So when you all were defending yourselves, that's when the rioting began, so to speak.
Speaker 1: Right.  Well, actually, the rioting started because these vigilantes were going around shooting up homes, shooting up businesses.  And to be very honest, the people in Wilmington were reluctant to fight back at first.  But when people started getting shot, then they had to, they had no choice but to fight back.  And when they decided to fight back, I decided to stay with them.  The United Church of Christ, they wanted me to leave Wilmington.  In fact, they escorted me out of Wilmington, and then the next day they wanted to fly me back, but I drove back, you know.  Because to me, I didn't think it was right to leave a community when they're desperate, in need of someone to stand with them.  What happens in a lot of these communities, one of the reasons why civil rights leaders had to go from city to city to city to city, you should wonder why.  It's because of in many of the local communities, the people who should be the leaders, the preachers, the businesspeople, are so compromised they're not gonna speak out.  So they're glad to see a [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], or they're glad to see a Ben Chavis, or they're glad to see a Golden Frinks, 'cause they know we will take the risk on their behalf.
Story_ID: 259540
Speaker 1: When you were first arrested, did you think "these charges aren't gonna go anywhere"?  What did you think?
Speaker 2: Well, I knew the charges were serious.  I knew we were completely innocent, and I knew that eventually by God's grace, we would prove our innocence of the charges.  But to be very honest, see, keep in mind now, by the time I was arrested in Wilmington [North Carolina] in March of 1972, I had already been arrested about forty times.  We didn't go into all of my arrests.  That's for another taping.  But I was first arrested in Charlotte [North Carolina] in 1967.  So between 1967 and March of 1972 I had been arrested over forty times.
Speaker 1: But were you thinking this was gonna be the same thing?
Speaker 2: And most, most of the prior arrests were just harassment, not serious felony charges.  These were serious felony charges.  And so I knew these charges were more serious by the nature of the charge.  I mean they had us charged with conspiracy to arson, conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to riot, conspiracy to assault, serious charges, all felonies.
Story_ID: 259541
Speaker 1: Sixteen people have been arrested on felony charges.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What happens next?
Speaker 2: Well, our arrest took place.  I founded a church in Wilmington [North Carolina] called the First African Congregation of the Black Messiah [Wilmington, North Carolina].  See, keep in mind, by 1970, '71 [1971] I'm affirming that Jesus Christ was an African, a black man.  And not to put white people down, it was just we had to correct history.  And I had a black church.  The building was literally black.  We painted the church black with a red, black, and green cross on the top, on Castle Street in Wilmington, 711 Castle Street was the address.  So, I had just come back from the Gary [Indiana] convention.  You know the first National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana?  I'm sure some people have talked about that in other programs.  We've--history is so important.  Wilmington, North Carolina, during the period of slavery was a slave port.  It was Wilmington, North Carolina, Savannah, Georgia, Charleston, South Carolina, and Norfolk, Virginia, major slave ports.  So what happened after the Civil War during the period of Reconstruction, black people took over this particular slave port.  In 1898 most of the businesses in Wilmington were black owned, first black newspaper in the state, businesses.  But in 1898 there was a race massacre called the Wilmington massacre.  There are parts of Brooklyn, New York [New York], today that are called Little Wilmington where people migrated from Wilmington, North Carolina, to Brooklyn, New York, as a result of that massacre.  And every year they have something called the Wilmington Ball, a dance, where they commemorate transferring whole families.  They literally had to hide in the woods first and make their way up to New York [New York].  So when I went to Wilmington in 1971, it's against this background of hostility which came to head over the desegregation of the schools.  So, by the time we were arrested in March of 1972, it wasn't just the police decided to come over to this church that had a red, black, and green cross.  It's what that church stood for.  That church stood for the resistance to white supremacy.  That church stood for the resistance and sort of a reclaiming of the history of Wilmington going back over a hundred years, because at the National Black Political Convention in Gary, Indiana, we even had a resolution passed restoring the control of Wilmington back to black people.  It was just a resolution, but it scared white people to death.  They said, "Oh, Lord, black folks coming back to take over our city."  And some of us had in mind to take over the city, 'cause there wasn't enough people registered to vote.  There was a disproportionate incarceration, because it was a slave port, and a lot of drugs were being imported in.  Drugs had been just beginning.  You have to understand also the devastation of the Vietnam War.  When I was locked up in prison, 50 percent of every inmate I saw in all kind of prison system were Vietnam veterans.  After they'd come back and fight that war, they didn't get good jobs, went straight to prison.  So, another thing I just wanna indicate for the record, we were attacked in this church in 1971, Gregory Congregational [United] Church [of Christ, Wilmington, North Carolina], by the ROWP [Rights of White People], which I said were former Marines, United States Marines, white Marines, prior [U.S.] military group.  There are a lot of instances of racial hostility in Vietnam between soldiers.  They brought that back to the States.  And we--I would not be here alive to be able to tell you this interview if it were not for black soldiers from the 82nd Airborne [Division] that came down from Fayetteville, North Carolina, to help defend our church against the attack from the white Marines in the ROWP.  That's just a part of military history that has not been given too much light of day.
Story_ID: 259542
Speaker 1: But to answer your question, it was at nighttime.  It was in March of 1971.  I was in my church [First African Congregation of the Black Messiah, Wilmington, North Carolina].  The police surrounded the church.  I didn't want them to raid the church.  I went outside and said, "What's the problem?"  They said, "[HistoryMaker] Reverend [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.]," at the time, "you're under arrest for the disturbance that had happened a year earlier."  So I didn't resist arrest.  Later that night they began to bring in the others.  And we served notice that we were innocent at our arraignment.  And it took us almost ten years to prove our innocence.
Speaker 2: Were, so were you jailed that night?
Speaker 1: I was jailed that night.  I stayed in jail for four months.  And the first night that they put us in jail, they tear gassed us while we were in jail in the New Hanover County [North Carolina] jail.  The sheriff's deputy said, "Oh, we got you now."  And I remember I had a cross, a little African cross called a thalesimo [ph.].  And he jerked the cross around my neck and said, "Nigger, we got you now.  Even God ain't gonna help you in here," and they tear gassed us.  But you keep in mind now, I'm a twenty-one-year-old grown man by then.  I had smelled tear gas before.  I had been locked up before.  I had been shot at before.  Nothing they could have done was gonna make me bow down to them.  And that's all what it's about.  You have to understand part of the injustice of black people is they break your spirit, and once they break your spirit, they got you.  And I'm very thankful to my co-defendants, who were only fifteen, sixteen and seventeen years old.  I was the adult.  They were only kids.
Speaker 2: Of the others (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) The others were just fifteen and sixteen years old.  They were high school student leaders, and those young men stood strong.  That was their first time being tear gassed.  That was their first time being locked up.  I was a veteran.  And they stood, we stood together in rigid solidarity.  Because they went to their parents and said, "All right, if you will turn state evidence against Reverend Chavis and the rest, we'll let you go."  None of them would do that.  They refused to lie to try to save themselves.  It's a remarkable story.  Most political prisoner cases don't wind up like ours, you know.  We're one of the first major political prisoner cases in America where we overturned our convictions and cleared our records, where the government admitted that they had framed us all, where the government admitted that they had paid witnesses to lie on us.  But it took a lot of struggle to get to that point.
Speaker 2: And the United Church--
Speaker 1: Of Christ.
Speaker 2: --of Christ [United Church of Christ] posted your bail?
Speaker 1: Right, six months later they posted a five hundred thousand dollar bail (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Because--
Story_ID: 259543
Speaker 1: What were those six months like in jail?  And I'm, and [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.], let me ask you this: were you thinking at this point, "this is for real"?
Speaker 2: Well, actually, I kind of knew it was for real before then.  I was prepared (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Were you prepared?
Speaker 2: I was prepared.  You have to understand, all my movement days had prepared me for that moment.  My greatest concern, to be very honest, was not my personal safety.  It was my co-defendants.  They were young guys.  They'd never been in jail before, so I had to be the father to them while they were in prison.  I had to--how can I say?  I had to outpour into their heads everything I had learned, because I knew they were gonna separate us.  They kept us in the New Hanover County [North Carolina] jail for two months.  Like I said they tear gassed us.  Then they sent us to Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina.  Now keep in mind, we're not convicted yet.  We're just charged, but yet they put us in prison.  And because in North Carolina they say they can imprison a person for "safekeeping," if it's unsafe for them to be in jail.  They said it was unsafe.  I don't--I guess it was they were admitting that we were vulnerable to their attacks, so they sent us in prison.  And then they divided us up into ten different prisons.  They would not let us be in the same prison.  They tried to break down our communication.
Speaker 1: Divide and conquer.
Speaker 2: Divide and conquer.  So the United Church of Christ put up five hundred thousand dollars' bond.  So we get out of prison in July, actually, late July, early August to prepare for the trial that was gonna start in September.  There's something I need to say first.  Let's back up.  Before we got out on bail, first there was no bail.  How did we get bail?  Because we had a mistrial.  Our first trial was in June of 1972.  We did a lot of good work.  We had [HistoryMaker] Julius Chambers, James [E.] Ferguson [II], a very famous lawyer named Reginald [F.] Lewis, who later became to be TLC Beatrice's [TLC Beatrice International] Reginald Lewis, was our lawyers.  We knew that we were not gonna get a fair trial if we didn't get blacks to stay on the jury, 'cause normally that part of the South when you're--during the jury venire you ask a question, you say something and get off the jury, particularly if there's a racial trial.  So, we had--we were in prison, but my colleagues had rallies about importance of staying on the jury.  We wound up with ten blacks and two whites on the jury in June of 1972.  We felt very good about that.  That was a jury of our peers.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And as soon as the jury was impaneled, because what happened, a lot of the whites disqualified themselves, saying, "Oh no, we think these niggers are guilty."  And so they had to be disqualified.  The blacks said, "Oh yes, we haven't heard anything about this case.  We can be impartial."  As soon as the jury was sworn in, the prosecutor, whose name was James Stroud [Jr.] stood up and said, "Your Honor, we want a mistrial."  We objected.  The judge granted the mistrial.  You know why the judge granted the mistrial?  Because the prosecutor said he had a stomachache, and there was no one else to try the case.  So, it's something about a right to a speedy trial.  Because it was clear the state was asking for the mistrial unjustly and got a mistrial unjustly, then our bail, then they gave us bail, five hundred thousand dollar bail.
Speaker 1: For all ten?
Speaker 2: All ten.
Story_ID: 259544
Speaker 1: So we got out, prepared for our trial.  Thirty days later on August the 31st, in Raleigh [North Carolina] where our Commission for Racial Justice, United Church of Christ office was--my sister [Dr. Helen Chavis Othow] is teaching at St. Augustine's College [St. Augustine's University, Raleigh, North Carolina] where I had gone to school earlier--I left my office on the night of August 31st, Fayetteville Street office.  It's about six blocks--about eight blocks from St. Augustine's College.  I was driving.  Actually, it was my mother's [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] car, an Eldorado Cadillac, blue with a white top.  I'm driving.  I notice from under the front seat a flame ejects.  And you know, being a former chemist, I know what an acetylene flame looks like.  So I said, "Oh, man, something is about to happen."  So I put the car in park.  I'm worried about the car.  I don't want nothing to happen to my mama's car.  I get out.  I put the car in park.  I bend over.  I wanted to pull whatever it was from under the front seat.  As soon as I got down on my feet out of the car, I bend over with my right hand.  As I was beginning to stick my hand under the front seat, the whole car blew up.  I received first, second and third degree burns on my right hand.  The explosion knocked me away from the car, thank God.  The--it was totally incinerated.  There was some kind of incendiary device, I think some kind of military phosphorus incendiary device placed in my car.  The local Raleigh police investigated it.  They turned it over to the state bureau investigation.  They turned it over to the FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation].  The FBI turned it over to the alcohol, tobacco, and firearms division [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] of the treasury department [sic. U.S. Department of Justice].  And to this day, there's never been a final report on the bombing of my car.  I went back to trial with my other co-defendants a week later with my arm in a sling.  And our lawyer said, "Well, we'd like to have more time to prepare for the trial.  [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.] just narrowly escaped an assassination attempt."  And you know what the prosecutor said?  "There's no record this was an assassination attempt.  Chavis was probably carrying explosives."  And of course, the judge agreed with the prosecutor.  They're going on with the trial.  This time they bring in a different judge.  At the first trial, they allowed the defense to question the potential jurors and then it goes to the state.  This time the state gets to ask the jurors the questions first, and then it goes to the defense.  In North Carolina law they have something called peremptory challenges.  That means they can take you off the jury for no reason.  And each defendant, for each defendant the state has I think ten peremptory challenges.  There were forty-two people, forty-two blacks in the jury pool.  The state used forty challenges to take all the blacks off the jury.  They only had two left, so we wound up of a jury of ten whites and two elderly blacks, just the opposite racial composition of the first jury.  It was that jury after a two-month trial that found us guilty of all those charges, and we were sentenced collectively to 282 years in prison.
Speaker 2: And this was in 1972.
Speaker 1: Two [1972].
Story_ID: 259545
Speaker 1: First trial was in March--I mean first trial was in June, went into a mistrial.  Second trial started in September of 1972.  The trial goes from September through the end of October, two-month trial.  At the end of that, we were sentenced to 282 years in prison.  Of the [Wilmington] Ten, I had the longest.  I had a thirty-four-year sentence, had a 24 to 34-year sentence.  When the judge stood us up and handed out all the time, they brought us to the courtroom chained ankle to ankle, waist to waist, hand to hand.  I mean, and then basically the judge said, "You'll never see the light of day."  And of course, we were not gonna let that break our spirit.  We filed our notice of appeal.  We go to prison.
Speaker 2: But I wanna ask you, when the jury read that verdict, what went through--were you surprised?  Because you were innocent.
Speaker 1: We were innocent, but I, you know, the climate.  I'm giving you the short take of the story.  There were all kind of things that came out during the trial, that the federal government were paying people to lie on us.  There were two black witnesses that the government paid, paid 'em to get out of prison to lie on us and then took the two brothers who lied on us to the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] ranch outside of Wilmington [North Carolina], Tex Groths [ph.] is his name.  And this came out in trial.  So, obviously we wanted to be found not guilty.  We were totally innocent.  But to be very honest, the handwriting was on the wall.  The state, the way they flipped, how they chose the jury, sent in a special judge, it was clear that not only the State of North Carolina, but the federal government had an interest in putting us in jail.
Speaker 2: Did the judge hand down your sentence immediately after the verdict?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And when he said thirty-four years, what were your thoughts?
Speaker 1: I stood motionless.  I was, I--my mother [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] cried out.  My daughter, Michele [Chavis], my oldest daughter was in the court.
Speaker 2: How old was your daughter?
Speaker 1: She was born in 1967.  And so this was 1972.
Speaker 2: Two, 1972.
Speaker 1: Right.  So she was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) About five or six.
Speaker 1: --five or six years old, yeah.
Speaker 2: And so, did you think that you were gonna be in prison for thirty-four years?
Speaker 1: I prepared myself for the worst.
Speaker 2: What was the worst in your mind?
Speaker 1: Spending thirty-four years.  I've never--one of the important things, it's one thing for somebody to give you a sentence; it's another thing to accept it.  I never accepted the sentence.  In fact, as the judge was giving out the sentence, I tried to even block out even hearing what he was saying, because part of getting your spirit crushed is to accept an injustice.  And the night before all of the members, we had discussed--'cause it looked like, you know, the jury was gonna find us guilty.  But we decided look, whatever they say, whatever they give out, we're just gonna roll with it.  We're gonna deal with it.  We were gonna keep our heads up, you know.  We sang 'We Shall Overcome' as they were putting us into the--they had a bus that took us to prison.
Speaker 2: Did--as the, the older person in the group, did you feel some responsibility for--
Speaker 1: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  I had to show strength for them.  I felt, absolutely I felt responsible for them, even the way we were tried.  The state wanted to try us separately.  I said no, try us together.  And in truth, United Church of Christ at first wanted to only defend me.  I said no.  We have to defend everybody.  We're in this together.  We're gonna win this together.  We're gonna struggle together.  We have to stay together.  So absolutely, even to this day I feel responsible.  I stay in touch with the members of the Wilmington Ten, you know.  I'm writing a book about the Wilmington Ten, and whatever royalties come from it I'm gonna share with them.  I, absolutely I feel responsible.  When you're in leadership you have to not only feel responsibility, you have to take responsibility for those who follow you.
Speaker 2: Especially 'cause they were so young.
Speaker 1: Absolutely.
Story_ID: 259546
Speaker 1: And so, you go to prison.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: What prison did you go to?
Speaker 2: They kept me in five different state prisons.  The first prison was Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Speaker 1: Where you had been before.
Speaker 2: Where I had been before.  Then they moved me to Asheboro State Prison [Randolph Correctional Center, Asheboro, North Carolina]; then they moved me to Caledonia State Prison [Farm; Caledonia Correctional Institution, Tillery, North Carolina]; then they moved me to McCain State Prison [McCain Correctional Hospital, McCain, North Carolina]; and the last prison was Hillsborough State Prison [Orange Correctional Center, Hillsborough, North Carolina].
Speaker 1: And were you all ever in the same prison together?
Speaker 2: Only two, Marvin Patrick and I were in one prison together, but they kept us fairly well spread out.  And of course, there were several attempts on our lives while we were in prison.
Speaker 1: While you were in prison?
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: From white inmates?
Speaker 2: Yes, well, to be very honest, in the first six months I was at Central Prison I never went out of the prison cell to take a shower.  Because if I had've gone to the shower, I would have been stabbed in the shower.  I knew who had the knife.  I knew how it was gonna go down.
Speaker 1: How'd you know?
Speaker 2: Well, in prison there are no secrets.  And a lot of the older black inmates, even though they were much older than me, they looked up because they knew I was a freedom fighter.  And so I learned the convict code.  I learned how to exist.  I learned how to survive in prison.  And when somebody gives you information that vital, you follow it.
Speaker 1: And when you arrived at prison, were you somewhat of, and just for lack of a better term, were you somewhat of a celebrity?  Did people know who you were and that kind of thing?
Speaker 2: Well, I was somewhat of a negative celebrity.  In other words, I didn't get good treatment.  I got the worst treatment.
Speaker 1: What about from the African American inmates?
Speaker 2: They were my brothers.  I wrote while I was in prison.  I found more humanity among the black inmates inside of Central Prison than I found out in the community.  I mean just one example: I don't smoke.  I would see an inmate break a cigarette into five pieces so that five guys could get a smoke out of that cigarette.  I mean, I saw inmates who never get a visit, who never get a letter, share, when one of them gets a letter, it becomes a letter to the whole cell block.  You know, the things I learned in the movement were further crystallized as a result of the prison experience.  I don't recommend anybody going to prison to strengthen their faith in God or to strengthen whatever they're doing.  I came out of prison stronger not weaker.  But the reason why I came out of prison stronger is I went in with a sense of determination not to let the experience break my spirit, or the spirit of the movement.  Because keep in mind, I had become a representative now of a movement that wasn't locked up.
Story_ID: 259547
Speaker 1: The movement was still dynamic--
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: --gaining spirit.  I mean Stokely [Carmichael; Kwame Ture], who I had introduced at [The] University of North Carolina [at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina] years before is now living in Ghana--I mean in, not in Ghana, in Conakry, Guinea, so he writes me.  I get a letter from Stokely from Africa.  That was liberating.
Speaker 2: Did you get--
Speaker 1: Then Nelson Mandela and I started writing each other.  He's in prison in Robbens Island [sic. Robben Island] in South Africa.  I'm in prison in North Carolina.  We're both political prisoners, and we're writing to each other.
Speaker 2: What did he say in some of his letters to you?
Speaker 1: Stay strong.  Don't let 'em break your spirit, you know.  The Wilmington Ten case had become a cause celebre, and, and I must say this on the record, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union [Russia], the Communist Party of Cuba, the Communist Party of France supported the Wilmington Ten case.  Young students in Paris [France] chained themselves to the U.S. embassy because of the Wilmington Ten case.  When [Henry] Kissinger is going around trying to free political prisoners in other countries, they're raising about the Wilmington Ten case.  [HistoryMaker] Angela Davis and I become very close friends during this period of time.
Story_ID: 259548
Speaker 1: One of the things I need to tell you is that--the prison chronology.  Okay, we're sentenced to 282 years in October of 1972, and we're sent to prison.  The [United] Church [of Christ] raises bail money.  We give notice of appeal--excuse me--so I still get bail money, bail to get out.  So--
Speaker 2: After you've been sentenced.
Speaker 1: After I've been sentenced, and the others too.  We still get out because the church put up another half million dollars.  It became a money thing.  And what we found out was, through Reginald [F.] Lewis, this great lawyer, the State of North Carolina had invested our bail money without our knowledge and was making interest off of our bail.  So Reginald Lewis, being one of the smart lawyers he was, and James [E.] Ferguson [II] says, "Okay, you're gonna have to split the interest with the church, because you illegally invested people's bail money without their knowledge, without their consent."  So--'cause you have to understand, the United Church of Christ is a predominantly white church, a black center.  White folk weren't really feeling--'cause you have to understand, for many people who didn't know us, we are guilty till we prove our innocence.  And because I was a preacher and because I worked for [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.], people said, "Well, maybe he's a little innocent."  But nobody really thought we were all innocent.  That came over time.  And over a ten-year period, members of [U.S.] Congress, even--[President Gerald Rudolph] Ford [Jr.] is out.  [President James Earl "Jimmy"] Carter [Jr.] becomes president.  He talks about human rights.  My daughter [Michele Chavis] by then is eleven years old, writes Carter a letter about her father being in prison.  [HistoryMaker] John Conyers [Jr.] comes to the prison to see me.  They pull a gun on him while he's visiting me in prison.  I mean there was a lot of drama.
Story_ID: 259549
Speaker 1: But one thing I need to tell you, after my first month back in Central Prison [Raleigh, North Carolina], 1972, they burned an inmate alive right next to me.  His name is John Cutino.  They throw a five-gallon can of paint thinner on him, lit a broom, and burned him alive.  I was already mad and enraged by being locked up unjustly.  But I felt now I had to become an advocate not just for the members of the Wilmington Ten but for all inmates in the North Carolina prison system.  It was dangerous.  These guys are committing murders, prison guards, you know.  And so because of the smoke--this is in December of 1972--they put everybody out in the prison yard.  It's cold.  Because of the cold they put us in the cafeteria.  In the cafeteria I stage a rebellion, in prison.  What I mean by that, not a violent--we refused to go back to our cells after they cleared the smoke out.  They come in, they point their guns at us and says everybody back to their cell.  We said no, we're not going, said it's dangerous.  We're not going.  There are no fire extinguishers in the prison.  In fact, we have a list of demands we wanna present to Mr. [Vernon] "Lee" Bounds, the commissioner of corrections.  Until Mr. Lee Bounds comes to this prison, we're not going back to our cells.
Speaker 2: So you were emerging as a leader once again wherever--
Speaker 1: Of very hardened inmates.  In fact, some of the inmates say, "Reverend Ben [HistoryMaker Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.], just give us the signal.  We'll tear the prison up."  I said, "No, we're not gonna tear the prison up, 'cause then we'll play into their hands.  We ain't doing nothing."  And then some of the inmates, particularly--you know, some white inmates in there too, who's got KKK [Ku Klux Klan] tattooed all over them.  They don't really feel--and I'm still, now I'm only twenty-one, twenty-two years old.  I've become their spokesman, 'cause they came out and said well, look, you know, we--they admitted to me, said, "We don't like you, but we know what you're doing is gonna help.  So just for this moment we're gonna stand with you."  I said well, that's cool.  I said because really--I had to punk them a little bit.  I said you shouldn't punk yourself by going out.  We're gonna stand.  And if you've got differences with me, we can settle those later.  Lee Bounds, six o'clock in the morning comes to the prison.  We negotiate.  Nobody's hurt.  We get prisoner's rights.  We get fire extinguishers for the first time in Central Prison, hundred-year-old prison, save some lives.
Story_ID: 259550
Speaker 1: We're gonna begin with me slating the tape again.  So this is the continuation of Dr. Ben Chavis' [HistoryMaker Benjamin F. Chavis, Jr.] interview.  And my name is Racine Tucker-Hamilton.  I am the interviewer.  Matthew Hickey is the videographer, and Hassan Muhammad is observing.  Today's date is Wednesday, February 2, 2005.  And this interview is taking place in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Yes.
Story_ID: 259551
Speaker 1: The Wilmington Ten had just been convicted of all charges, and you were sentenced to thirty-four years.  Can you kind of tell us a little bit about what prison life was like for you?
Speaker 2: Yes.  The day that we were sentenced, in October of 1972, the judge lined us all up in the court.  We were convicted one day.  They sent us to spend the night in the Jacksonville, North Carolina jail and then brought us back to the courthouse for sentencing the next morning.  Our trial and sentencing was in a town called Burgaw, B-U-R-G-A-W, North Carolina, in Pender County, North Carolina.  And Pender County is adjacent to New Hanover County [North Carolina].  They would not allow our trial to be in Wilmington [North Carolina] or New Hanover County where the incident happened.  They had changed the venue.  And as I recall, that morning the judge lined us up and gave us all the time.  I had the longest sentence of twenty-nine to thirty-four years.
Speaker 1: Is that because you were the oldest and considered--
Speaker 2: Because I was older--
Speaker 1: --and considered the leader?
Speaker 2: --I was considered the leader.  And the others, at least eight of them were only 15, 16, and 17 years old.  They were teenagers.  The total of all of our sentences, all ten sentences, was 282 years in prison.  Obviously we served notice of appeal that very day, that we were not accepting these unjust charges.  We maintained our innocence throughout the whole period of time.  But it was interesting, that morning when they had to take us from the Pender County Courthouse in Burgaw, North Carolina, to Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, they had a prison bus.  The North Carolina Department of Corrections bus was backed up to the back steps of the courthouse.  And they put us in chains before leaving the courthouse, leg irons, then chains around our waists, and then chained each of us to one another, so it was like a line being led.  You know, and I thought to myself and others thought, this is just like slavery.  The chains were probably not as heavy, but they were chains.  The shackles were made of probably a different kind of iron, but they were shackles, along with the handcuffs.  And of course, a big crowd was outside the courthouse, our supporters, and our parents were there, at least my mother [Elisabeth Ridley Chavis] was there and my oldest daughter, Michele [Chavis], was there.  There was--some of my sisters were there, and family, as well as the family members of other members of the Wilmington Ten.  They were crying, my family, but we decided that we wanted to uplift the spirits of our family members so we sang.  As we were coming out of the courthouse we sang 'We Shall Overcome,' and we sang different songs all the way to prison.  You know, I guess most people would be silent, sad on their way to prison.  We were the opposite.  We were not joyous or happy about our conviction or happy about the fact that we were on our way to prison, but we had decided among ourselves we were not gonna allow them to break our spirit.  Even on the way to prison, we were not gonna have our spirits broken.  A couple of members of the Wilmington Ten were musicians, you know.  Willie Earl Vereen was one of the great drummers as a young man.  He could play two drums at the same time, and so he was beating the beat on the seats.  And James McKoy was a bass guitar player.  And so he didn't have a bass guitar, but he used his voice as the bass.  And so we were creating our own beats and music on the way to prison.  They treated us like we were the most dangerous criminals in the world.  In addition to the prison bus, they had four to five state troopers, police cars that cleared the highway.  They wouldn't allow any car to pass our bus on the way to prison, and it's a two-hour drive from Burgaw, North Carolina, to Raleigh, North Carolina.  They took us to Central Prison.  We got there; they processed us.  Most of us had big afros.  They told us that they were not gonna allow--we had to cut our hair.  They weren't gonna allow us to wear afro haircuts.  They strip searched us, took all of our clothes off, gave us prison clothes, and took all of our belongings.  We registered.  And then they divided us based on age.  Most of the members of the Wilmington Ten were too young to be in prison in the adult prison, so some of them were sent to Polk Youth Center [Raleigh, North Carolina], which is a youth prison in Raleigh, myself, Connie Tindall, and Marvin Patrick, they were 19, 18 and 19.  They were with me at Central Prison.  We were not put in the same cells.
Story_ID: 259552
Speaker 1: Central Prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a two hundred-year, 150-year to two hundred-year-old [sic.] prison.  It was built in the 1800s by slaves.  It has been modernized, but the basic wall of the prison is still there.  It's right downtown Raleigh in Wake County, North Carolina.  Raleigh is the capital of North Carolina.  The first cell I was put in was not--was a single cell.  I was on the F Block on the west side of Central Prison.
Speaker 2: Was it a maximum security prison?
Speaker 1: Definitely a maximum security prison, yes, maximum security.  And I stayed there for about thirty to forty-five days.  Let me back up.  When we were convicted, we served notice of appeal.  And when you serve notice of appeal, your conviction--we wanted an appeal bond, and they set a five hundred thousand, a half million dollar appeal bond for the members of the Wilmington Ten.  This is back in 1972.  Five hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money now, but it was definitely a lot of money in 1972.  So even though I was an employee of the United Church of Christ, it took the church awhile to raise the bail money.  And quite frankly, I wanted the church to raise the bail money for all the members of the Wilmington Ten, not just for me.
Speaker 2: Was it five hundred thousand dollars for all ten or per--
Speaker 1: Five hundred thousand dollars for all ten.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Right, because our cases were consolidated, I wanted to make sure that whatever benefit that I got in terms of support from the church would also be of benefit to the other members of the Wilmington Ten.  Now what happened was as soon as I arrived in prison, most of the black inmates, they knew about the Wilmington Ten.  The older inmates, they--I never had a problem with other prisoners.
Speaker 2: What was the racial makeup of the prison in 1972?  Do you know?
Speaker 1: Yes, in 1972 the prison was about 75 percent black, 20 percent white, and 5 percent Native American.  When I first arrived, the very first day I was told by some of the older brothers, some of the older black inmates, not to take a shower because some white inmates had been given shanks.  A shank is a sharp piece of metal.  And you wonder well, how did the inmate get sharp piece of metal?  It comes out of your shoe.  In the prison shoes that are made there is a piece of metal in the sole of the shoes.  So they tear the shoe up, get the piece of metal, and then scrape it on a concrete floor until it becomes razor sharp, so it's a homemade knife; that's what a shank is.  And they said these guys are gonna shank you if you go to the shower.  'Cause keep in mind, by 1972 I was not only known as the member of the Wilmington Ten, I was a black militant, student, youth.  I guess at about twenty-two I wasn't any longer a youth leader by then, but I was a young man who was clearly a black power advocate.  I was clearly identified with having a strong challenge to white supremacy.  And of course, what happened in Wilmington [North Carolina] was when we decided to fight back the Ku Klux Klan [KKK] and their ROWP, the Rights of White People, so it was well known that we were a group of brothers who had fought back.  And because we fought back we were now in prison.  And of course, there were also some white supremacists in prison, in the same prison, Central Prison, so it was dangerous.  So I followed the advice.  So for the first six weeks of my incarceration I did not take a shower in the shower.  I washed myself up.  There was a little bowl sink.  In fact, I very rarely would go out in the recreation yard.  They'd give you one hour of recreation.  Whenever I would go out in recreation I would always make sure that there were other inmates with me.  So, it was not that I was afraid so much, cautious.  I wanted to live through the prison experience.  I did not go to prison to die or to be killed.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: So I had to take measures, precautionary measures while I was in prison just to live, and one was not to go to the shower, because in the shower it's a group shower.  There would be forty or fifty men in the shower at any given time.  When they ring the buzzer, open your cell up, shower, everybody has to step out of their cell, cell doors shut.  And these are--this is not a very modern prison.  The opening and shutting of the doors was not electronic.  It was all mechanical, so this is steel opening vary rapidly and closing very rapidly.  Later, they modernized it.  So a lot of men, if you don't step out of the cell on a moment's notice, you can get caught in the door.  There's no spring back, you know, like in elevators.  No, that door is shutting.  That steel is shutting no matter what's in its way.  So, usually when a command is given to step out of your cell, everybody, no matter, steps out very quickly, or you stay in.  I would usually stay in.
Story_ID: 259553
Speaker 1: There was an incident while I was in prison in the first week of December of 1972.  A friend of mine named John Cutino, C-U-T-I-N-O, he was from Durham, North Carolina--I was 22, 23.  John Cutino was around 28, 29 years old.  He was one of the leaders of the black inmates, black prisoners in Central Prison [Raleigh, North Carolina].  The prison is a mirror image of the larger society.  I was on the third tier, Cell F, so I, in prison, like I was on Third Street.  First Street was the first tier; Fourth Street was the fourth tier.  And you know, I was, in a--and so, while I was in F, on Third Street on the F Block, John Cutino was also on Third Street in the F Block.  He was two cells down from me.  One night after--lights are off at ten p.m.  Everybody is supposed to be locked in their cells after ten p.m.  Because it's a maximum security prison, you're locked in your cell all the time, but I mean the doors don't open for any reason after ten p.m., unless it's an emergency.  Sometime after ten p.m., somehow a group of white inmates got out of their cells.  They were let out of their cells by white officers, prison guards.  And they got a five-gallon can of paint thinner, and they threw the five-gallon can of paint thinner in on John Cutino, and then they lit a broom, and they burned him alive in his cell.  It's an awful thing to hear, a human being crying for help.  And there were no fire extinguishers on the west side of Central Prison at that time.  And so when the fire engulfed the whole cell, the guards basically let it happen, and there was no attempt to extinguish the fire.  I was very angry about what happened to John Cutino.  So on that night I decided I had to put my own personal safety on hold because it was clear that the whole cell block, the whole west side of Central Prison was unsafe for any inmate.  And also that a murder had just taken place.  We needed justice for John Cutino.
Story_ID: 259554
Speaker 1: So, and it was so much smoke from the fire of that one cell they had to evacuate the whole cell block.  So all of the inmates, including myself--this is in December, it was cold--were put out in the prison yard.  And while we were out in the yard, of course everybody was concerned about what had happened, you know.  Among the inmates, they're saying, "How could this happen?"  This was, you know--at first we thought the guards did it, but we later found out the guards let some inmates out who actually did it.  And so while we were out there, I was trying to figure out, well, what could be done to demand justice?  We're locked up.  Nobody, there's no outside world; there's no telephone; there's no cell phone.  How are we gonna even let the world, outside world know that John Cutino has been murdered?  Because the temperature was dropping, they, in different shifts, would put one to two hundred inmates inside the prison cafeteria.  When it came time for my group of inmates, who were black and white, randomly chosen by the prison guards that had guns on top us on the wall of the prison, they said, ordered us into the prison cafeteria where there was some heat.  When we got in the cafeteria, I met with other inmates, and we decided that we were not going back to the cell block.  And I became the spokesman of the inmates, even though I was much younger.  They asked me to be their spokesman, and I agreed.  Mainly or most of 'em were black.  There were some whites who also, strangely, wanted me to be their spokesman.  And my--I said on one condition: we all have to stick together.  Don't punk out on me.  If we're making the demands, we're all gonna have to stand together or else they will pick us off one by one.  And keep in mind, in a prison cafeteria, it is itself a cage.  There are tables and they're chairs, wooden tables and chairs, nothing fancy.  And around the perimeter of this cage, there's an outer cage.  So prison guards with weapons stand in the corridor around the perimeter of the cafeteria, and they had guns.  They had tear gas rifles as well as regular shot guns.  And they were--they brought in more prison guards because there were several hundred inmates in this tight area.  To make a long story short, I said to the lieutenant on duty that we would like to see the secretary [sic. commissioner] of corrections whose name was [Vernon] "Lee" Bounds, B-O-W--no, B-O-U-N-D-S, Bounds, Lee Bounds.  And they said, "Oh, you, you can't see the secretary.  You can't see the head of the [North Carolina] Department of Corrections.  You, you're a prisoner.  You can't make a demand."  I said, "Well, we're not leaving this cafeteria until we see Mr. Lee Bounds.  We have a list of grievances.  The west side of Central Prison [Raleigh, North Carolina] is unsafe, and we're not leaving until our grievances are addressed."  They brought in the superintendent whose name was Sanders [ph.].  And Superintendent Sanders was a very tall white guy with red hair.  And he signaled for me to come over.  And he said to me--he was trying to whisper it, 'cause he didn't want the other inmates to hear what he was saying.  He says, "If you don't tell these inmates to go back to the cell, we're gonna mop this floor with your blood.  We're gonna get--your blood is gonna be the first blood."  And I leaned back over to him.  I said, well, I said, "Well, you'd better get the mops out, 'cause we're all standing together."  I said, "You're running a prison that's unsafe, and we're not going back into that cell block.  You just had one man murdered tonight.  There was no fire extinguishers.  And our demands are not unreasonable demands.  We're not asking for, to be released from prison.  We're asking for the prison to be safe.  We're asking for fire extinguishers."  And I said, "We're not leaving until we see Mr. Bounds."
Speaker 2: So did you eventually see Mr. Bounds?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: And were your demands met?
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: So, were you starting to emerge then as a prison leader as well?
Speaker 1: Well, a spokesman.  I mean I think all of the brothers who had been in there many, many years had learned leadership skills.  Most inmates would do anything to get out of prison, and so most of them would not challenge the prison authority because you, that's on your record.  I wasn't interested.  I didn't go into prison to compromise.  I felt we were unjustly there, so I felt I had a greater freedom to speak in the interest of the inmates than maybe some of the others.
Speaker 2: Did you--
Speaker 1: So, yes.  The answer is yes.  I became a almost--but it was also very dangerous.  And I'm telling you this story, you have to understand, prisons are run off of authority.  And people who run prisons don't ever wanna give up authority to the prison inmates, 'cause they feel like then the prisoners are in control of the prison rather than the people who's supposed to be.
Story_ID: 259555
Speaker 1: Sanders [ph.] really did not wanna, you know, back down, but he had a superior.  I think if it had been left to Mr. Sanders, we all would have been severely injured, some killed that night [at Central Prison, Raleigh, North Carolina].  But I think it was too embarrassing to have an incident.  There already, a man has been murdered in prison.  Murder is not supposed to take place in prison.
Speaker 2: And--
Speaker 1: So I think we had them between a rock and a hard place because we were not doing anything.  Now some of the inmates, and I know we need to move on, just to make this point.  Some of the inmates, particularly the white inmates, wanted to tear up the cafeteria.  There's only thing, one thing in there, a television, they said let's tear--I said, "No, what do you want--you tear up the place, then you give them an excuse to bring down (unclear)."  I said, "No, we're gonna be orderly.  We're not gonna give them no excuse other than our resistance to go back to the cell block."  And we won out.
Speaker 2: And was there ever justice for Mr. [John] Cutino?
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: No one was ever convicted of that crime?
Speaker 1: I think there was an investigation, and we will have to check the records.  But in my knowledge, there was no justice for the family of John Cutino.  Some inmates were arrested, but I don't--whatever, in terms of eventual trial and conviction, I don't think so--
Story_ID: 259556
Speaker 1: Because of this incident, United Church of Christ back in New York [New York] obviously was concerned about my safety.  So two weeks--a week before Christmas they raised enough money to get me out on bail.  I was very, kind of--I wanted to get out 'cause of safety, but I didn't wanna get out of prison without the other members of the Wilmington Ten.  So, before signing the bail papers, I said, "Look, I'm only gonna sign these bail papers if the church promises to raise the rest of the money for the Wilmington Ten, for the other members of the Wilmington Ten," which they eventually did.  But it took them five, six months, you know.  So I got out in December of 1972.  Now, and I, and of course I had to leave North Carolina.  But there were other charges filed on me.  So a very famous black lawyer named Reginald [F.] Lewis, who later became an entrepreneur, had to fly on a plane with me back to North Carolina where I had turn myself again in on other charges.
Speaker 2: Were these charges related to the original conviction, or were they new charges?
Speaker 1: New charges.
Speaker 2: New charges.
Speaker 1: But they were out of Wilmington [North Carolina].  They were all conspiracy charges.  They were determined to try to keep me in prison, and my main concern was getting the others out, and also not going back to prison myself.  Over, from 1968 through 1972 and '73 [1973] I was arrested over forty times.  The most serious charges were the ones in the 19--in the late '70s [1970s], arising out of Wilmington.  But I've been in and out of many jails, many prisons, North Carolina, Virginia, mainly.
Speaker 2: And so you spent a total of seven years.
Speaker 1: Well, actually a total of five and a half years.
Speaker 2: Five and a half years--
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: --on the Wilmington--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Ten charges.
Speaker 1: Right, because what happened was we got out.  We got all the members of the Wilmington Ten out by June of 1973, while our case was on appeal.  When we lost--when the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear our case in December of 1975, in January of 1976 we had to go back to prison.  So I was put back in Central Prison [Raleigh, North Carolina] in 1976, in fact, back on the west side, back on F Block.  Mr. Sanders [ph.] was not there by then.  So all of 1976 I was in prison, all of 1977, all of 1978, all of 1979, and we won our case [Chavis v. State of North Carolina] in 1980.  So, I spent most of 1972 in prison, you know, when the (unclear) case, and that's where the five years comes from.
Story_ID: 259557
Speaker 1: You went to Duke University [Durham, North Carolina] while you were a prisoner, correct?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Tell us a little bit about that.  Did--you went and your (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Okay, well, just let me--so, the person looking at this can keep track of what's going on.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I get out on bond in December of '72 [1972].  I was put back in prison in--for a few days in 1973.  I get back out.  We're still appealing our Wilmington Ten case.  We lose our appeal initially in 1975, so all of 1976 through 1980 we're in prison.  And one of the things I need to tell you, when I went back to prison in 1976, they transferred me from Central Prison in Raleigh [North Carolina] to a place called Caledonia [State] Prison Farm [Caledonia Correctional Institution, Tillery, North Carolina].  That's in eastern North Carolina, and guess who's the superintendent of Caledonia Prison Farm?
Speaker 1: Sanders [ph.].
Speaker 2: Mr. Sanders.  So, well, you know, obviously that was a very contentious situation and also another very dangerous situation.  And, but still I was determined to organize and make it difficult.  I didn't intend to make it easy for those who were unjustly incarcerated in Wilmington [North Carolina] to do it easily.  And so Mr. Sanders put on my prison folder that [HistoryMaker Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.] should be--'cause I read some black inmate--some of the black prison guards, which I--were friends of mine also.  That's another thing: I made friends with not only inmates but also with prison guards.  So from time to time I would read my own prison record, what they were writing on my record.  And while I was at Caledonia, 'cause I didn't stay there too long obviously, Sanders wrote that I should be put in a prison where black inmates are in the minority.  And of course there was only one.  That's a hard prison to find in the South.  But there was one such prison like that in North Carolina.  It was called the North Carolina Prison Sanatorium [sic. McCain Correctional Hospital, McCain, North Carolina].  And in that prison it was, they had three wards: a geriatric ward for inmates who were over seventy; a tuberculosis ward, if you had a contagious disease; or a behavior modification ward, if you were mentally disturbed.  When I was transferred from Caledonia Prison to McCain State Prison Sanatorium, they put me in the tuberculosis ward.  Obviously, I was not sick; I did not have tuberculosis.  I was with inmates who were very kind inmates, but they all were wearing masks because they had a contagious disease.  They did not give me a mask.  So I immediately started protesting, "Why am I being put in a situation," because tuberculosis is a very contagious disease, and you can pass it on to your relatives, anybody who comes to visit you in prison, plus I didn't think the inmates were being treated right, because it was not just me; other inmates were sent to that ward for punishment, as a way of institutionally punishing you for being an outspoken prison advocate from inside by putting you in that situation.  So, I stayed there in McCain Prison even in spite of that situation for two years--two and a half years.  And then I was transferred to the Hillsborough Prison [Orange Correctional Center, Hillsborough, North Carolina] in Orange County, North Carolina, which is adjacent to Durham County [North Carolina] where Duke University is.  And one of the reasons why I was transferred, because I had already started my master's program at Howard University [Washington, D.C.].  I transferred my credits to Duke University while I was in prison, got accepted to Duke University, master's of divinity program.  And then I put pressure on the prison system to allow me to attend Duke University during the daytime to finish my master's degree while I was in prison.
Speaker 1: And so you went in shackles and chains?
Speaker 2: Yes.  I would leave Hillsborough.  This is from '78 [1978] to, it's for two years, 'cause I already had enough credits for one year.  Master's divinity program is a three-year program.  So from 1978, I would receive my degree in the spring of 1980, but I actually finished all my course requirements by December 1979, 'cause I also went to summer school in '78 [1978] and in '79 [1979].  It was very difficult.  They would take me to Duke University in the morning in chains, let me off, go to class.  They'd pick me up at 5:30 every day to go back to the Hillsborough prison.  And it was a very rigorous course of study.  I had to learn Greek, translate the New Testament from English to Greek.  But I was a good student; I did very well.  I finished my master's [of] divinity from Duke University magna cum laude in the spring of 1980.
Story_ID: 259558
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.], you earned your master's of divinity in Duke [University, Durham, North Carolina] in 1980.
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Now when were you actually released from prison?
Speaker 2: We actually--I was the last of the Wilmington Ten to be released.  I was released in December of 1979.  As a result of the governor of North Carolina at that time, named Jim Hunt, had reduced our sentences.  We wanted him to throw out the sentences altogether.  He refused.  He only shortened our sentences.  And this was after--by this time, [President James Earl] "Jimmy" Carter [Jr.] is president.  Griffin Bell, the attorney general ordered an FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation] investigation of our case.  They found out that all the witnesses had lied against us, in fact were paid, some by the government, to lie against us.  Amnesty International in 1978 had declared that the Wilmington Ten case was the first case of political prisoners in the United States.  We don't--we know we were not the first case.  There were many political prisoners in the United States, but it was at least, it was the first time Amnesty International declared officially that there were political prisoners in the United States of America, and it was our case, the Wilmington Ten case.
Speaker 1: And did that--
Speaker 2: So that put a lot of pressure on the governor, on the president.
Speaker 1: Right, because of the international (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Everywhere they went.
Speaker 1: --publicity.
Speaker 2: When Andy Young [HistoryMaker Andrew Young] was UN [United Nations] ambassador, he spoke about our case.  So it was--the Wilmington Ten case became a cause celebre all over the world, in France, in Cuba.  In fact, when I was in prison, students in France chained themselves to the U.S. embassy to protest the incarceration of the Wilmington Ten.  I would get bags of mail from Germany, people writing in the German language, and from Africa.  Nelson Mandela and I used to write each other while I was in prison.  While he was in prison on Robbens Island [sic. Robben Island, South Africa], I was in prison in North Carolina.  I had a very close, and still do, relationship with the African National Congress, the ANC.
Speaker 1: And--but just having your sentence reduced, that wasn't enough for you all.
Speaker 2: No, we continued to fight our case in court.  And finally, the Fourth Circuit, U.S. Court of Appeals [Richmond, Virginia] overturned the convictions of the Wilmington Ten on December the 4th, 1980, which means our records were cleared, our convictions were overturned.  We were no longer considered convicted felons.
Story_ID: 259559
Speaker 1: Is that when you started to become involved in environmental racism?
Speaker 2: A little later.  In 1980, I was transferred then from Washington, D.C., to New York [New York].  I became the deputy national director of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice.  This is the organization you recall that I started working in back in 1968 after Dr. King's [Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.] assassination.  I left SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference] and went to the Commission for Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ and stayed at the Commission for Racial Justice of the United Church of Christ from 1968 until 1993 when I became head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  So, in 1980 I was appointed deputy director of the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, working directly then under my mentor, the Reverend Dr. Charles [Earl] Cobb, here in New York.  The United Church of Christ had its headquarters on Madison Avenue, first on Park Avenue in New York, 23rd Street, and we later moved to Madison Avenue at 30th Street.  And it was during my tenure in New York as the deputy director of the Commission for Racial Justice and then later as executive director, because I was appointed executive director of the Commission for Racial Justice in 1985.  And it was in 1983 that I first coined the term environmental racism.
Speaker 1: And tell us what environmental racism is.
Speaker 2: Environmental racism is racial discrimination in environmental policymaking.  It is the disproportionate targeting of minority communities for toxic waste dumps, for toxic waste facilities.  It's the disproportionate, the deliberate, disproportionate exposure of minority communities, black, Latino, Native American, Asian to environmental hazards.  That's how I defined it in 1983, but you have to prove things in America, so you just can't make an allegation.  So, by 1987, the Commission for Racial Justice of United Church of Christ did the first statistical analysis of every zip code in America, including Alaska and Hawaii.  And we compared that with known data from the EPA, [U.S.] Environmental Protection Agency, of where all these toxic waste facilities--and it showed there was indisputable evidence that it was a direct correlation to the racial composition of the zip code to where these facilities were located.  And of course, the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia] also had a study to show that these same areas were disproportionate for cancer, for respiratory diseases, for asthma, and other things that were disproportionate in the black communities, directly related to environmental hazards.  So, in a sense, during the 1980s I became somewhat of an environmentalist.  I would actually challenge the traditional environmental organizations to incorporate more of minority concerns.  And I mean the [National] Audubon Society, the Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation, all of a sudden I was attending their meetings.  And there was a whole movement going called the environmental justice movement.  And of course, by the time President [William Jefferson "Bill"] Clinton became president, he issued an executive order on environmental injustice.  I believe the year was 1990--no, it was 1994.  At that time, I was the head of the NAACP.  So, yeah, for about eight years I worked directly, along with other things.  'Cause you know, in the Civil Rights Movement you have to do--you just can't focus on one issue.  There's environmental racism; you know, there's racial profiling; there are all kinds of--and there's still battling school desegregation; inequity in housing, redlining housing; disproportionate incarceration, I mean you name it.  You have to challenge injustice where you find it.  And we were the Commission for Racial Justice so, I felt that this was an area sort of untapped, unfocused on, and needed--'cause there were places like down in Louisiana, a place called Cancer Alley--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --between Baton Rouge [Louisiana] and New Orleans [Louisiana], where all these petrochemical facilities are located, also in Houston [Texas] or in Dallas [Texas], different communities all over the country.  So it was a great movement.  Now, today, the environmental justice, the agency, there's a unit within the EPA on environmental justice as a result of our work.  So we're very pleased that now officials who are in charge of environmental policy no longer deny that this exists.  They admit it exists, and there are programs now to try to remedy the disproportionate exposure of minorities to environmental hazards.
Speaker 1: And many environmental organizations now have environmental justice campaigns within their organization.
Speaker 2: That's right.  It's a national movement on its own, and it's alive, and from time to time they call me back to speak on it.  And part of it is also because of my background.  As you know, as you recall that my undergrad degree [from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Charlotte, North Carolina] is in chemistry, so I was always somewhat interested in the chemical exposures to our community and to our people, and how to property combat it.  'Cause I think it's--life itself is something precious, and we should protect ourselves from all dangers, including environmental dangers.
Story_ID: 259560
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in 1993, when you became executive director.  I believe you were the youngest--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --executive director in the organization's history.  How did that opportunity come about?
Speaker 2: Well, thank you.  When the Reverend Dr. Benjamin Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks] announced his retirement from the NAACP, he had made his announcement in 1992.  And in 1992 I was well secure as the executive director and CEO of the organization I had worked for all my life, for thirty years, the Commission for Racial Justice of United Church of Christ.  By 1992, the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice had moved its headquarters from New York [New York] to Cleveland, Ohio, so I was living in Cleveland with my wife [Martha Rivera Chavis] and family.  And Reginald [F.] Lewis, my longtime partner in civil rights and entrepreneurship, suggested that I candidate.  And at the time, I knew that [HistoryMaker] Reverend Jesse [L.] Jackson, a colleague of mine in the Civil Rights Movement, was candidating for the position.  As soon as Dr. Hooks announced, Jesse made it known that he was interested in the position.  And so everybody felt that Jesse was a shoo-in.  And as I recall, when Reginald Lewis first mentioned it to me, I really was a little reluctant because I really, I was in a secure--and I didn't wanna leave necessarily a very secure position to go to something that may be slightly insecure.  The NAACP had sixty-four board members.  It was sort of an older civil rights organization.  And we were doing exciting things at the time with the United Church of Christ Commission of Racial Justice.  And so it was a sort of a calculated risk.  But Reggie convinced me, and he said that if I would run, he would back me, which was significant.  'Cause by this time Reginald Lewis had become the CEO of TLC Beatrice [International].  He's the first African American billionaire--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --in the world, and I respected his judgment and his advice.  And I filed an application.  As I recall, the deadline was November the 20th, 1992, and I got my application I think maybe November the 18th.  And that December I put together a team to help me campaign for the position of executive director of the NAACP.
Story_ID: 259561
Speaker 1: The election was in April of 1993.  The full board--there was a search committee, search process.  There were hundreds of people running.  It got narrowed down to ten; then it got narrowed down to four.  I was one of the final four, [HistoryMaker Reverend] Jesse [L.] Jackson, myself, [HistoryMaker] Jewell Jackson McCabe, New York, over at the [National] Coalition of 100 Black Women, and Earl Shinhoster, who was the southern regional director of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] at that time, so we were the four finalists.  Now something happened that was significant in this.  In January of 1993, Reginald [F.] Lewis dies unexpectedly, tragically.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: He had just turned fifty years old.  And that was a real tragic blow, to me personally as well as I think to our people.  His brother--and his brothers helped me continue with my campaign for the NAACP, as well as his wife, Loida [Nicolas-]Lewis, and his brothers, Tony [Anthony Fugett] and Jean [Fugett], but particularly Tony Fugett.  Right before Reggie had died, he asked his brother, Tony, his younger brother, Tony, to work with me toward the NAACP, which he did, faithfully.  So we're in Atlanta [Georgia] for the board meeting.  The week of the board meeting, April of 1993, Jesse pulls out of the race, and so it left three.  And on the first ballot, with three names on the ballot, I won a plurality of the votes on the first ballot.
Speaker 2: Was there any concern that you may have been a little too radical for the organization, or do you think that that assisted in your winning (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Right.
Speaker 2: --because they needed--
Speaker 1: Well--
Speaker 2: --to change?
Speaker 1: --that's a good question.  During the search process that issue came up.  And Percy Sutton was on the search committee, and he thought my background would have been an asset for the NAACP to particularly reach young people.  'Cause the NAACP by that, by 1993 had a hurdle to get over because a lot of young people were not as aware of the NAACP's great history in the past, and there were questions about the NAACP's relevancy to what was going on.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: And of course, I was very--I sent each of the sixty-four board members a videotape, and it was a composite videotape of my work at the Commission for Racial Justice.  It shows very activist.  I said that if I'm elected, I would bring young people into the organization, but not to sit, to be activated, to build a movement of young people so we'll have a new generation of freedom fighters, new generation of civil rights advocates and civil rights activists.  I wanted to make civil rights appealing to young people, make civil rights cool to young people.  That was my goal.  And I felt a majority of the board members, by their vote, agreed with that.  Now obviously, it was not a unanimous vote.  There were some on the board, to be very honest, at the beginning of my tenure, who were opposed to my activist tradition.  And I was aware of it, but I thought I could win those board members over by making progress for the organization.  And as soon as I was elected that April--it was Good Friday--I didn't even go to the headquarters back in Baltimore [Maryland], I went straight to Los Angeles [California].
Story_ID: 259562
Speaker 1: Because this was the week--very week that the police officers were on trial again for beating of Rodney King.  And as you know, a year before, L.A. [Los Angeles, California] had gone up in flames.  And I wanted to identify with the young people of L.A., so I moved, I went from Atlanta [Georgia] to L.A., actually slept on the floor in the public housing projects in South Central Los Angeles [California] with the Bloods, and the Crips, and gang members, and convinced young people who had been in gangs to join the youth chapter of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in the L.A. branch.  And I would much rather see them wearing NAACP jackets than gang paraphernalia.  Now, the people in the Watts [Los Angeles, California] branch of the NAACP, they were very happy about that.  But there were others that were concerned that I was somewhat leading the organization in a more militant--but I think the NAACP should be militant.  Medgar Evers was a militant, you know, and I think that's what the NAACP still needs, to fight for freedom.
Speaker 2: And do you think that you were successful during your tenure of making the organization more appealing to young people and--
Speaker 1: Well, according to the membership rolls, in the first year, almost a hundred thousand new young people joined the NAACP.
Speaker 2: And what was your vision for the organization?  What kind of NAACP did you want to see under the [HistoryMaker Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.] helm?
Speaker 1: Well, one, I wanted--you know, when I came to the NAACP it was financial trouble.  There was a deficit before I was hired.  And one of the things I wanted, I promised I would help: the NAACP never had an endowment; I wanted the NAACP, our nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization, to have an endowment, so it wouldn't have to beg every year just for corporate support.  Part of my role as executive director of NAACP, I had to raise money.  So the family of Reginald [F.] Lewis started the first endowment.  They put up two hundred thousand dollars cash to start the first endowment for the NAACP, and that endowment is still in place today.  It's called the Reginald F. Lewis [Memorial] Endowment for the NAACP.  And I really wanted to have a hundred million dollar endowment for the NAACP as a goal.  Also what happened during my first several weeks on the job, the Denny's situation happened, where this corporation who served food to people was discriminating against black people.  And so what always happens, usually the organizations would go in, and there were many different civil rights organizations negotiating with Denny's, SCLC [Southern Christian Leadership Conference], NAACP, [HistoryMaker] Reverend [Jesse L.] Jackson's Operation PUSH [Rainbow PUSH Coalition], you know, would make impressions.  My thing is, I didn't want to get a few crumbs from Denny's to settle this.  My position was, if the NAACP was gonna settle this, it's gonna have to be settled in a big way where it would imbue a benefit to the community, not only to those who were directly discriminated against, but to those who would later be discriminated against if we didn't change this company's policy.  So, I convinced Jerry Richardson, who was the CEO at the time of Denny's, to establish the largest fair share agreement with the NAACP ever.  It was a $1.2 billion dollar agreement where Denny's would not only agree to hire a lot of African Americans, change its policies, but the most important aspect of this was that they were gonna provide entrepreneurship.  A lot of African Americans wound up owning hundreds of Denny's restaurants as a result of this agreement.  So, in other words, lot of times I'll go now, years later, to a lot of these restaurants.  I say, "Who owns this restaurant?"  You know, how is it going?  'Course they don't realize it's me, former head of the NAACP.  And it was a controversial thing to get involved in and to try to get it settled.  I don't like to string things out.  If you gonna do something, let's do it; let's get it settled; let's move on to the next thing.  That was sort of my attitude.  And I would--the pace of my work at the NAACP was very fast-paced.  I was not stationary; I was on the go constantly, all over the country.  There were different things happening.  The Sacramento [California] branch at NAACP was fire-bombed, you know.  Before the dust settled after the firebomb, I was there to be with the NAACP.  And I think the NAACP needed to see its leadership on the ground, in the field, on the street.  And as a result, you know, we built up a lot of I think very positive support from the grassroots, which was another goal of mine, to reconnect the NAACP to the grassroots, not to disconnect from corporate America, but to--to me the strength of an organization like the NAACP is its membership, is its grassroots space.  Prior, I think they had been overly focused on strengthening NAACP just for corporate America.  I think that is important, but that should not be your sole mission.  You gotta connect with the people, particularly where people are hurting and crying out for freedom, justice, and equality.
Story_ID: 259563
Speaker 1: During your tenure, there were allegations of mismanagement and womanizing (simultaneous).
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: Now, how do you respond to those allegations and those charges?
Speaker 2: Well, you know, the main--there were allegations of sexual harassment.  There were allegations of mismanagement.  All those allegations were false allegations, but they were serious allegations.  When the complaint of mismanagement was lodged, I wanted to make sure there was an audit.  See, one of the things there was at dispute: was there a deficit when I start, or did I start the deficit?  I inherited a deficit.  And one of the things I'll encourage anybody going to any organization, never take on an organization without getting an audit first, because--and that's one of the things that I did not do, and I should have done.
Speaker 1: Because was the deficit bigger than you thought it was?
Speaker 2: It was much bigger.  You know, it was over a million dollar deficit.  And this is not to say anything negative about Dr. Hooks [HistoryMaker Reverend Benjamin Hooks]; just the organization had become stagnant.  The organization could not replenish itself every year with the same level of support.  And the membership was dwindling, you know, and so the organization needed to be revitalized, financially as well as membership base.  But to me, the way to, best way to restore financial security for the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was to in, increase the contributions of members and not just rely solely on the contribution of corporations.  And that was a dispute within the organization.  Also if--I know exactly what happened to me.  The board members that supported my election were loyal to the very end.  The ones who were opposed to my election were in opposition from the very beginning.  And they were waiting for--and so a lot of things were blown out of proportion.  The person who made the allegation of sexual harassment [Mary Stansel] was a person actually that I brought to the NAACP.  She was a young sister--well, she was actually a couple of years older than me--who was a lawyer on Capitol Hill [Washington, D.C.].  She needed a job, and I gave her a job.  But the job did not work out, and I fired her.  And one of the reasons--after I fired her, she made allegations against the NAACP.  To protect the NAACP, I met with the executive committee of the board.  We needed to protect ourselves from these allegations.  Let's try to settle this thing.  Even though allegations are not true, let's settle it.  And we reached an agreement with her attorney to settle out of court.  Now the executive committee knew about it but not the full board, and I think if I had to do it all over again, I would have demanded that the full board be made aware of the settlement, to try to spare the organization any kind of long term embarrassing court battles on allegations that was not true.
Speaker 1: Do you think the full board would have been accepting of the agreement?
Speaker 2: I think the majority of the board members would have accepted the agreement, if they knew about it in the beginning.  But keep in mind, though, there was a small group of people on the board who were against anything that I did.
Story_ID: 259564
Speaker 1: But I think the thing that became the straw that broke the camel's back at NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] was when I decided to outreach to [HistoryMaker] The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan.  One of the things I noticed by being the executive director of the NAACP during the eighteen months I was there, black leaders were not talking to one another.  It was incredible to me that we have our major organizations, and the leadership of our major organizations are not even--it's not that we're not speaking to one another but not meeting, not planning.  No one organization is gonna provide the liberation for our people.  We all have to work together.  And that was another goal of mine.  I wanted--to me, since the NAACP was the largest and the oldest civil rights organizations, we should host a meeting of all the leaders, and that's what we did.  It was called the National African American Leadership Summit.  It was held in June of 1994 inside the NAACP headquarters.  And I wanted all of the leaders, from the Masons, from the sororities, to the fraternities, to religious leaders, to business leaders, to our Ph.D.s; [HistoryMaker Dr.] Alvin Poussaint was there; Dr. Betty Shabazz was there.  It was the first time Betty was in the same room with the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan since Malcolm's [Malcolm X] assassination.  So it was a great unity meeting.  And I was threatened.  My life was threatened for even planning that meeting.  In my home I have these bushel baskets of cards I received from all over the country threatening me because, specifically because I had reached out to Minister Farrakhan.  But I thought: he was a leader; he should have been invited to the meeting.  I'm thankful that we invited him to the meeting, and we had a great meeting to plan how to take the next course of working together.  I wanted to see the organizations--there was too much disunity among our leadership.  People wanna know why don't we have more unity in the community.  Well, part of the problem is sometimes the various leaders don't want unity.  And you can't expect the people to go beyond its own leadership.  You know, if there's disunity in our community, then there may be disunity among the leaders.  And I felt that if you get more unity among the leaders, you can get more unity among the people.
Speaker 2: And do you think that there was opposition against specifically Minister Farrakhan because people didn't recognize him as a leader?  Or, why do you think there was opposition, strong opposition?
Speaker 1: Well, I think that there were several things.  One, I think people did recognize that Minister Farrakhan had a strong following in the African American community.  But I think that how leadership is defined has gotten changed over several decades.  It used to be that an African American leader is defined by that leader's relationship with the people, with the community.  What is that leader doing in the community?  That's why he became the leader.  But by the 1970s and '80s [1980s], we began to have what I would call media defined leadership, where the media puts light on people, and you become a leader because you're getting coverage in the media, not necessarily because you're doing something in the community, because you're getting--so a lot of times now a lot of up and coming leaders would be doing things to get media coverage 'cause that's how leadership is being defined.  [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] never sought media.  That brother put his life on the line to make change in the community.  And so, for Minister Farrakhan doing his great work with his great oratorical skills, he had the ability to speak to issues.  I thought it was wrong to exclude him.
Story_ID: 259565
Speaker 1: And see, something happened; there's a backdrop to this.  In 1993, this would have been the anniversary of the March on Washington, that August, from '63 [1963] to '93 [1993], so it's the thirtieth anniversary.  By that time, I'm the head of the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People].  So, all the leaders of the different organizations are speaking of the thirtieth anniversary.  And there was a conference about whether or not [HistoryMaker] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan should be invited to speak.  And the person on the conference call said, "Well, no, if you let Minister Farrakhan speak, we're gonna dismantle the stage; we're not gonna pay for the sound system."  I thought that was wrong.  I said, "What's wrong with Farrakhan?  He's a leader; he should be able to speak."  And part of the problem was that they said that Minister Farrakhan was anti-Semitic.  Well, whenever I talked to Minister Farrakhan, he said he's not anti-Semitic.  And I said we need to--and I know I wasn't anti-Semitic, and I didn't believe he was anti-Semitic.  I think that people were putting a jacket on Minister Farrakhan unfairly.  And to be very honest, I saw Minister Farrakhan as my brother, and I was not gonna allow forces outside of my community to tell me, particularly while I was head of the NAACP, who I could meet with and who I could not meet with.  And a lot of that would happen.  So, he was denied; he was not allowed to speak at the march.  One month later at the Congressional Black Caucus--and at the time, Kweisi Mfume was the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus.  He had a leadership forum.  And to Kweisi's credit, he invited Minister Farrakhan on the panel.  So, we're all up there speaking, but nobody had just talked about Minister Farrakhan being denied speaking at the March on Washington, so I brought it up.  I said, "Look, we need to offer Minister Farrakhan our apology for not allowing him to speak at the march."  I said, "This is a leadership forum.  We got a fresh start to tell the truth."  And you know, a lot of people in the audience really liked it.  A lot of my board members felt that I was too candid, and we also had a--I was trying to work to end gang violence.  And we were gonna have a conference to end gang violence in Chicago [Illinois].  And I went and I spoke at Mosque Maryam [Chicago, Illinois] as the head of the NAACP.
Story_ID: 259232
Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.], we left off with Chicago [Illinois].  You were in the process of trying to--
Speaker 2: Trying to end gang violence.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: We were trying to end gang violence across America.  There were two major summits in 1993.  The first one was in Kansas City [Missouri].  That was in April where we, where the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] under my leadership, working with other national organizations, sponsored the first gang summit.  We had gang leaders from the West Coast, from the East Coast, from the South, Midwest meet in Kansas City for three days.  Why, to end gang violence.  Now, the question is, everybody wants gangs to end, but what are you gonna do, what are these guys gonna do after they get out of the gang?
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Or how can we use the organization of the gang that once was for illegal purpose, how can you use that for legal and righteous purpose?  And to me that's, to me it was irresponsible not to address this issue because there were so many young men--in the early '90s [1990s] we reached the height of black on black crime.  And as an African American person offering leadership to a national organization, that had to be an issue that we could not ignore.  So to me, let's go to the heart of the matter.  Let's meet with the gang leaders; let's meet with the Bloods; let's meet with the Crips; let's meet the Disciples of, the Gangster Disciples; let's meet with the OGs, you know, let's meet with them, let's meet with the Blackstone Rangers [Black P. Stone Nation]; let's meet with everybody, and we did.
Speaker 1: Was it success, would you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: (Simultaneous) Yes.
Speaker 1: --characterize it as a successful?
Speaker 2: Very successful, very successful, at least the internecine warfare that was going on between the gangs began to subside.  And that also increased my frequency of communication with [HistoryMaker] The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan because a lot of the brothers who were in the Nation of Islam also were working in the street to end gang violence.  And when I spoke at Mosque Maryam [Chicago, Illinois] in October of 1993, Minister Farrakhan allowed me to go up in his pulpit in Mosque Maryam.  It's a marble thing, very nice.  And I went up, I held in both hands--this Associated Press picture that went on in all the press.  I'm holding a Bible and the Koran [Quran], because I'm trying to promote unity.  A lot of the young brothers who were in various gangs around the country either considered themselves Muslims, either considered themselves Christian, and I didn't want them fighting each other.  I wanted them to know there's only one god, the god in this book is the same god in this book, and it went beautiful; it really went beautiful.
Story_ID: 259233
Speaker 1: But I was criticized for that.  In fact, Dr. [William F.] Gibson, who was the chairman of the board, kind of said, "Hey man, some of the board members are concerned about you spending time with [HistoryMaker] Minister [Louis] Farrakhan."  And I said, "Well, Dr. Gibson, at the end of the day, are we not being more effective?  At the end of the day, are we not getting the youth membership in?  At the end of the day, are we not lowering and decreasing gang violence and self-destruction?"  The board members should be happy, you know.
Speaker 2: But do you think that your budding relationship with Minister Farrakhan ultimately led to your troubles with the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]?
Speaker 1: Well, there's no question.  I think my refusal to succumb to pressure for me to repudiate Minister Farrakhan, for me to disassociate with Minister Farrakhan, for me to cut ties--it wasn't just about me spending time; they wanted me to do just the opposite, to denounce Minister Farrakhan.  I refused to do that.  In fact, I did just the opposite.  I became an advocate of dialogue, an advocate of communication, an advocate of promoting understanding, 'cause I felt that Minister Farrakhan and the whole entire Nation of Islam was being misunderstood.
Speaker 2: Did--
Speaker 1: Those young brothers under Minister Farrakhan's leadership was doing good work in the community.  I saw it with my own eyes.  They were turning lives around who were on roads to self-destruction.  Now they're on roads to righteousness.
Speaker 2: What's the biggest misconception in your opinion about the Nation of Islam?
Speaker 1: I think the biggest misconception about the Nation of Islam is that they think that the Nation of Islam, some people think the Nation of Islam is a cult, is an organization that makes people do the wrong things when it's just the opposite.  It's an organization that gets you to work on yourself, self-improvement toward community development, doing for self, going into business for self.  There's an entrepreneur spirit there.  It's based on the teachings of the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad, who also was another misunderstood powerhouse leader that not too much is talked about, the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad.  In the 1930s, to come up with a plan for the black man and for the black woman to clean themselves up, to straighten up their own families, and to build their own communities, that was very powerful during the [Great] Depression of the 1930s.  And the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan has that mantle in this day and time.  And I, quite frankly, as one who has worked with the NAACP, one who has worked with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference [SCLC], worked with CORE [Congress of Racial Equality], I've worked with all of the organizations from the inside not from the outside.  And so when I started seeing the work of the Nation of Islam, I saw points of connection, points of continuity.  And I wanted to enhance that unity, 'cause I felt if we could embrace one another, it would bode better for young people coming up to see more unity among our leadership.
Speaker 2: Do you think Minister Farrakhan is controversial in some of the things that he says?  Do you think that they're controversial?
Speaker 1: I think the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan is outspoken.  I think he is free enough in his own mind and in his own spirit to speak truth that makes some people uncomfortable.  I have never heard, and I have been with the minister in intimate sessions, closed-door sessions, as well as very public and large sessions, and I've never heard the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan make an anti-Semitic statement, in fact, to the opposite.  The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan has an admiration for what--the essence of what it means to be a Jew, the essence of what it means to be a Christian, the essence of what it means to be a Muslim.  And I just think he's misunderstood.  And of course, in the 1992, in 1993, I did not realize then that by 1997, I would join the Nation of Islam myself.
Story_ID: 259234
Speaker 1: You eventually left the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People] in 1994?
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, in August of 1994, as a result of my refusal to cut ties with [HistoryMaker] The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan, I was fired from the NAACP in August of 1994.
Speaker 1: And--
Speaker 2: And we later--the most significant thing that happened after that, I began to work--we built an organization called the National African American Leadership Summit.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: I became the president and CEO of the National African American Leadership Summit.  It's based in Washington, D.C.  And it was out of that organization that I worked with the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan to help organize the Million Man March, which was on October the 16th, 1995, which became the largest gathering in the history of our people.
Speaker 1: And I know that you were probably hopeful that it would be a success.  But, were you at all the least bit surprised at how successful the Million Man March was, just in terms of the diversity of the people who attended and participated in that march?
Speaker 2: Well, we were pleased.  I would say that God answered our prayers.  What happened on October 16th, 1995, was exactly what we had prayed and what we had worked for.  See, I believe that when you pray to God for something, your prayer should be for God to give you the energy and the courage to work for what you're praying for, that we become the vehicles of the answers to our own prayers.  And that's what happened in the Million Man March.  Certainly, we prayed that a million brothers would show up, but we also knew in order for that to happen, we had to let God use us to go out in these communities all over the country, to in, put the encouragement out there, to put the understanding out there.  The reason why we didn't have a riot in Washington, because most of the brothers that came to Washington, their minds were minds were prepared before they got there.  It was peaceful; it was spiritual; it was a sacred moment in the history of our people, to see all those brothers standing shoulder to shoulder, about 1.8 million, almost two million brothers standing shoulder to shoulder for eighteen hours, no pushing, no cursing, no conflict, harmony.  Now if we can do that for one day, we ought to be able to do that every day all over America, if we have the will and if we have the proper motivation, the proper encouragement.  I learned a lot between 1994 and the execution of the Million Man March in October of 1995.  I was out in a lot of communities across the country and so was Minister Farrakhan.  We worked together.  We were like brothers working hard, you know, to pull this off.  And we knew that we had to overcome the disbelief.  The established media did not believe it was gonna happen.  See, keep in mind also, this was the year, '94 [1994] through '95 [1995] of the O. J. Simpson trial--
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: --you know, high drama on television every day, you know.  America's been divided by which side you were on this trial.  And of course, the trial concluded a month before the Million Man March.  Ninety-five [1995] was a pivotal year.  In my own development, it was sort of a triumph.  I mean one year after, being fired from the organization I love and respect, the NAACP, I'm able to come back, you know, to be the national director of the largest gathering in the history of our people, the Million Man March--
Story_ID: 259235
Speaker 1: Do you think part of it is because that's just what you do?  That's your forte really, you know, grassroots organizing, pulling people together.  Do you think that, how much of a role do you think that played in it?
Speaker 2: Well, I think we're all a composite of our evolution.  The things I was able to do in 1995 was a result of the time I spent in prison, was a result of the time I spent in the library (laughter), the time I spent identifying with the least of these.  You know, there's a scripture that say what you do until the least of these you do also unto me.  And to me there is great value.  I helped a lot of people, but in helping people, I got helped.  In giving, I received, you know.  From another philosophical perspective: the karma you give out is the karma you will receive.  And organizationally speaking, if you wanna move the masses, you gotta be with the masses.  You can't send the masses a telegram and say show up.  You gotta go to the masses and let them know there's something real in their level of expectation.  I've always been concerned throughout my whole life.  I don't ever wanna raise somebody's expectations beyond my capacity to deliver.  You know, and that's what organizing is about, the building blocks of mobilizing, the building blocks of organizing, the building blocks of trying to have goals and achieve those goals, not just in your own individual life but in a more broad sense of people, of men.  By 1995 black men in America needed to come together, needed to say no to self-destruction, needed to say yes, I will take a pledge, I will go back home and do these things.  And a lot of the brothers--one of the things I'm trying to work on now is some ten-year reflection on what happened after the Million Man March.
Speaker 1: And what kind of message do you think, the turnout, the diversity, all of that, of the Million Man March, what kind of message do you think that sent to the country at large?
Speaker 2: I think it sent a very positive message.  We did not go to Washington [D.C.] to beg the government for a new program.  We went to Washington and said this--we're making an affirmation of what we're gonna do; we went to atone; we went to become more responsible and more responsive to the condition.  I think wider America, seeing that image, I think it was a positive.  Because most of the images, keep in mind, before that time, of black men were very negative.  Keep in mind now, this is the O. J. Simpson trial.  And you know how they were extrapolating through O. J., black men in general.  It's interesting that, you know, ten years later something similar is going on with Michael Jackson now on a different whole kind of thing.  But I know that the image of the Million Man March had a positive impact not only on Americans but all over the world.  When you travel outside the United States the first thing people talk about: I saw that Million Man March.  You know, it was very inspirational to people all over the world.
Story_ID: 259236
Speaker 1: In 1997--and I know that I'm gonna get this wrong--you converted to Islam.
Speaker 2: Right, I joined the Nation of Islam in February of 1997--
Speaker 1: Why don't you (simultaneous)--
Speaker 2: --(simultaneous) as a part of the evolution of my ministry.
Speaker 1: Why don't you consider it a conversion?
Speaker 2: Because in the dictionary, conversion means you are one thing today; you're something else tomorrow.  But for me, it wasn't like flipping on a light switch on and off.  If you're a Christian, cut the light off, you're a Muslim, no.  The same God that I served in the church is the same God that I serve in the mosque.  It's just I'm deepening my understanding of who God is.  God is known by many names.  In the mosque we refer to God as Allah.  If you speak English, we would say God, you know, in the church.  But if you spoke a different language, you wouldn't even say God.  So, what we call God or Allah should not be the point of dispute.  What we should be focused on is, what is it that the one God requires?  What is it that Allah requires?  And strive to be obedient to that will, once you understand what that will is.  And to me, I find great connection between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  They're both, all three monotheistic.  All three say that Abraham was the father.  Now Abraham is interesting.  Abraham used to be called Abram, but he became Abraham because of his obedience to God.  So in a sense, Abraham, out of his obedience to God, was the first Muslim.  Because a Muslim only means to be obedient to the will of God; that's what a Muslim is.
Speaker 1: So you said Abraham, in your opinion, was the first Muslim.
Speaker 2: Well, yeah, he was a good Muslim, because my definition of a Muslim is one who strives, one who is obedient to the will of God.  That's how, if you go back and read Genesis, it tells you that God changed Abram's name to Abraham because, out of his obedience.  So words and phrases, sometimes we, we get tripped up.  Jesus was obedient to his father.  Now, I believe in one god, known by many names.  And God self-discloses God's self to different peoples, and different languages, and different cultures.  But because God self-disclosed God's self in different ways, we should say well, the way God self-disclosed himself to me is superior to the way God self-disclosed God's self to somebody else, no.  That's a very arrogant, elitist understanding, almost possessive, you know.  We try to take possession of God rather than allowing God to take possession of us.  And so to me, my joining the Nation of Islam is a part of a natural evolution.  Through my work with [HistoryMaker] The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan, I had to, prior to joining, I deepened my own understanding of the teachings of the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad, and they resonated with my whole life and still do.  But that doesn't mean I put down the church, and a lot of my Christian pastors misunderstood.  When they saw me up on the stage at the Saviours' Day, they saw me become the minister of Muhammad Mosque Number Seven [Masjid Malcolm Shabazz] in New York [New York], they thought that was a denunciation of the church.  No, it's not a denunciation of the church.  It's just that I'm on a journey.  And the god who called me into the church is the same god that called me into the mosque.  It's not a different god.
Speaker 1: And are you questioned at all from your Muslim brothers?  You said you did receive some questions or flak from your Christian brothers.  What about your Muslim brothers?
Speaker 2: Oh, I'm questioned also by my Muslim brothers.  They wanna make sure that I'm a real Muslim.  And of course, I give the same answer.  I don't give an answer to Christians and a different answer to Muslims.  I go to yoga with [HistoryMaker] Russell [Simmons], but that doesn't mean I'm a Buddhist because I meditate and because I practice yoga, which is also a spiritual meditation, which is also has some eternal truth that's very similar to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.
Speaker 1: So, let's talk about--
Speaker 2: I always look for unity.  To me, you--there's a scripture in the Bible that say, you know, you seek, you knock on the door, you seek after something, ultimately, you'll find it.  I'm seeking unity.  Now, if I was looking for disunity I could find it.  If I was looking for the disharmonies between Christianity, Islam, and Judaism I could find it, but I'm not looking for that.  I'm looking for what connects everybody.  I'm looking for what unites everybody.  I'm not looking for what divides people.  I wanna know what unites people to do good in the world, because I believe it's at that point that we can make a difference for people who are less fortunate, for people who have had a history of being oppressed.  I don't think the god that I serve wants black people to be oppressed.  I don't accept that.  But the question is, do we, as a people, want to be oppressed?  We have to free our own minds.  And sometimes we blame God for things that we should not blame God for.  We have to blame ourselves, out of our lack of understanding, our lack of knowledge, our lack of wisdom, the people perish.
Story_ID: 259237
Speaker 1: So, in 1997 I think, you became the East Coast regional minister of the Nation of Islam--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --in charge of [Muhammad] Mosque Number Seven [Masjid Malcolm Shabazz] here in New York [New York].
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: What were your responsibilities and your accomplishments in that position?
Speaker 2: Well, from 1997 to the year 2000 we worked on practicing the teachings of the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad, which are encouraging young people to get on the right path of life, to do for self, to build families.  It's interesting, between the Million Man March in '95 [1995], we had the Million Family March in the year 2000.  I was (simultaneous)--
Speaker 1: (Simultaneous) Was that--
Speaker 2: --I was the national--
Speaker 1: --as successful?
Speaker 2: It was not as large as the Million Man March, but it was very successful.  We had over a million people.  But the focus of the Million Family March in the year 2000 was family.  We conducted a marriage ceremony for thousands of families who came to me to renew their vows or get married.  We published a book, which I was the editor of, called 'The National Agenda: [Public Policy Issues, Analyses, and Programmatic Plan of Action] 2000-2008.'  I'll make sure you get a copy.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Which lays out a programmatic response to a number of issues affecting not only black people but all people.  Because at the Million Family March it wasn't just black families, it was all families.  There at the Million Family March there were black families, there were white families, there were Asian families, there were Native American families.  And of course, the Honorable Minister--and there were Jewish rabbis on the stage at the Million Family March.  It was another part of the evolution.  Also, you know, in 1997 was the Million Woman March.  I was also involved in helping those sisters in Philadelphia [Pennsylvania] pull off the Million Woman March.  So, you know, it's all about organizing and involving.  But as we approach the tenth year for the Million Man March, ten-year anniversary, I also am planning to be involved in helping to make that successful.
Speaker 1: But one thing--excuse me, [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.].
Speaker 2: That's all right.
Speaker 1: One thing I wanna ask you about is, during your tenure as the East Coast regional minister of the Nation of Islam.  There were allegations, once again, of--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: --sexual harassment.  Could you speak a little bit about that?
Speaker 2: Yes.  Well, in any new situation--first I went to the NAACP [National Association for the Advancement of Colored People], like I think I mentioned, people were trying to put an anti-Semitic jacket on [HistoryMaker] The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan.  Well, in my life, sometimes people have tried to put a sexual harassment jacket on me.  It becomes an allegation where people will make an allegation, then you have to defend yourself against it, and such was the case also even after I got to the mosque, you know, because people feel that if they make an allegation, they can make you give them some money, extortion.  There's a lot of extortion that goes on.  We live in a very litigious society where people are making allegations without any truth to the allegations, hoping that they would public embarrass you or get you in a situation where you would wanna settle with them.  And so, unlike the case with the sister [Mary Stansel] from the NAACP where we tried to settle out of court, we're not, we didn't try to settle out of court of this situation with the mosque.  We fought it in court.  In fact, it's still being fought.
Speaker 1: And are they totally unfounded?
Speaker 2: Oh, absolutely totally unfounded.  I've worked, in my life I worked for thousands and thousands of women, all ages.  And if you look at my career as a total, there have been very little allegations but the one noticeable allegation from the NAACP and the one from the mosque.  And the one from the mosque was timed also because I had persons who didn't agree with what I was doing in the mosque, as I had persons who didn't agree what I was doing when I was at the NAACP.  And so it became a convenient tactic to lodge unjust allegations, particularly something of a sexual nature, because then it puts you really in a defensive, and you have to defend yourself on it.  So that was very similar.
Speaker 1: And do you still serve in the capacity as Minister Farrakhan's personal assistant?
Speaker 2: I'm special assistant.
Speaker 1: Special assistant, I'm sorry.
Speaker 2: Yes, I still serve in the capacity of special assistant.
Speaker 1: And what are your responsibilities as special assistant?
Speaker 2: Well, I help the Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan on different projects.  It's assignment.  If he has something he would like for me to assist him on, then as his special assistant, I take that assignment up.  It could be from organizing an event, or representing him in a meeting, or giving some interpretation to a situation that may arise here in the United States or somewhere in the world.  I would be his emissary.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Story_ID: 259238
Speaker 1: And in 2001 you joined the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network.  Was it 2001?
Speaker 2: Right, in 2001 [HistoryMaker] Russell Simmons and I co-founded--
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: --we actually co-founded the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network in New York City [New York, New York].
Speaker 1: And tell us a little bit about the goal of the organization.
Speaker 2: The Hip-Hop Summit Action Network is the largest national coalition of hip hop artists and recording industry executives in America.  Our purpose is to utilize hip hop culture for positive social change.  On the one hand, we defend the artist's first amendment rights, cultural rights, artistic rights.  But on the other hand, we encourage the artist to give back to the community.  And over the last years we've held twenty-six hip hop summits in major markets all over the country.  We've registered millions of young people to vote using hip hop culture.  And in 2005, we're using hip hop to encourage financial literacy as well as reading literacy and financial empowerment utilizing hip hop culture.  In fact, I had to, in this job, sort of immerse myself within hip hop culture.  I go to the studios with the artists.  I've been in some hip hop videos myself.  And eventually, before not too long, I plan to put out a hip hop CD myself.
Speaker 1: What do you mean?
Speaker 2: I plan to rap.
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, interesting.  So, what are you gonna rap about, just--
Speaker 2: About the movement, about the struggle--
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 2: --struggle for freedom, and justice, and equality.  Hip hop is a very powerful medium of expression, the poetry, the lyric, the lyrics, the video.  It can captivate young people; it can capture their attention, and I think I would like to capture their attention about the struggle for freedom, and justice, and equality.
Speaker 1: Oh, we'll have to definitely look for that.  Now, was the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network involved in this past election in 2004--
Speaker 2: Yes.
Speaker 1: Were you all successful in terms getting out the young vote, you think?
Speaker 2: Well, yes.  We--the youth vote in 2000 was around eighteen million across the country.  In 2004 we go it up to over twenty-one million, with the largest youth voter turnout in American history in the 2004 election.  And it's directly as a consequence of our work with the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network and with other organizations that focused on not only registering young people to vote, but making sure that they go out to the polls.
Speaker 1: And did they go out to the polls in the numbers that you had hoped for this past election, 2004, [President George Walker] Bush, [Senator John] Kerry election?
Speaker 2: Well, it was the largest turnout.  I mean actually, it went over our prediction.  Our prediction was to get twenty million.  We had twenty-one million, but we have to still work at it.  I think the outcome of the election was not to our pleasing, obviously.  But the turnout in terms of African American youth vote and Latino youth vote was very pleasing.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: And what we're gonna do, now we've built a database of a lot of these young people.  We're wanna keep them active, keep them motivated, because you know, being involved in the electoral process is not a one-time thing.  You have to continue to be involved in it, so it's part of your lifestyle, so it's a part of your state of consciousness.  And I think we have been successful in placing within the hip hop world political empowerment.  There once was a time where many in artistic culture were sort of alienated from the political process, didn't see the relevancy of voting, but I think we've overcome that now.  We have some of the leading hip hop artists, leading hip hop celebrities who now regularly advocate voter registration, voter education, and voter mobilization.
Story_ID: 259566
Speaker 1: What are some of the main goals of the Hip-Hop Summit [Action Network]?
Speaker 2: Well, generally speaking, the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network supports youth empowerment.  Toward that end, we've been involved in a number of projects over the last four years.  First, we started challenging the FCC [Federal Communications Commission].  There was an attempt to censor hip hop.  They had fined radio stations for playing Eminem music.  And there was a sister named Sarah Jones, a black poet, poetess, and because a radio station played her poetry, the radio station was fined.  She took the FCC to court.  We supported her case in challenging the FCC and got it reversed.  We also was involved with the Recording Industry Association of America, the RIAA, to get parental guidance labels on all of the music.  For example, if you wanted to buy a CD for your children, before you make your selection, we have a label to tell you whether or not there's explicit lyrics or explicit content in that music, so that the parent will know, to give you some parental advisory of what kind of content the music has.  The Hip-Hop Summit worked with the recording industry to set up that labeling system called the parental guidance.  Also, hip hop is used for social change.  There was an issue in New York City [New York, New York] in 2002 when they were taking away funding for schools.  We have public schools in New York that don't have books, don't have desks, don't have adequate facilities.  And at a time more funding should be going to public education, a lot of municipalities, including New York, give less funding.  So we staged a big rally, over a hundred thousand young people that came down to city hall.  It's a hip hop rally.  I mean we had Sean "P. Diddy" Combs, Jay Z, Alicia Keys, 50 Cent, LL Cool J to come out and many others, Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, many others.  I'm starting listing all the artists, they're gonna get mad if I don't call all their names.  But just for instance, just to say, top of the crop of hip hop artists came out.  And on that very day Mayor [Michael] Bloomberg put back over three hundred million dollars back into the public school budget as a result of that rally.  It was very successful.  And then in 2003, we started a campaign to get the Rockefeller drug laws changed.  And the Rockefeller drug laws are mandatory minimum sentencing laws, which leads to disproportionate incarceration of blacks and Latinos across the country.  In New York State, 94 percent of all people incarcerated as a result of being arrested for the Rockefeller drug laws are black and Latino, 94 percent.  So we challenged that law, to give judges more judicial discretion, and to shorten draconian sentences, and pleased to report that in December of 2004 the laws were finally changed.  The governor signed a bill.  We were at the signing.  But that was a result of putting public pressure.  So hip hop does have the power to not only raise issues, but to change the circumstances, to get laws changed, and change the outlook of people.  But another thing that I think the Hip-Hop Summit was successful in doing was raising up a generation of young people who wanna make their communities better.  We also have something called Hip Hop Reader program, where we encourage literacy, young people reading.  We have book lists on our website to encourage young--and if they read all the books, they can get Sean John, Rocawear, Baby Phat, Phat Farm clothes or items--literacy, encouragement--because we found that a lot of the young people in many urban areas don't pass the third grade reading test.  We were very concerned about that, and we feel that because hip hop has penetrated the mainstream, we wanna make sure that that penetration is for positive impact, reading, economic empowerment, good citizenship, and community development.  We were very pleased with the response.  But hip hop is not just an American experience; it's all over the world.  We've been in touch with artists in South Africa, in Brazil, and eventually we'll be having, we're contemplating having an international hip hop summit.
Story_ID: 259567
Speaker 1: What about some of the negativity associated with hip hop, some of the explicit lyrics, some of the violence, some of what people would term as the degradation of women and portrayal of women in some of the videos?  Are you all working at all to change that a little bit?
Speaker 2: Well, absolutely.  Here's what we say.  Hip hop is a mirror reflection of the society.  Hip hop music reflects the culture.  And what is the culture?  It's the circumstances of the community.  We live in a society where there is misogyny, where there is degradation of women, where there is self-destruction, drugs, violence, sex.  And how are we gonna deal with this?  We believe it's better for our young people to confront these issues rather than to gloss over them and then not be able to handle these realities, like, just like AIDS [acquired immunodeficiency syndrome].  A lot of people don't wanna talk about AIDS and exposure of HIV [human immunodeficiency virus].  We talk about it.  We have to--right up front, because in our view, the more information we can give out as young as one of our young people can understand it, the better, rather than to shelter a young person, and then they come out into a world and can't handle the dynamics of the world.  All of the major artists that we work with, Nas, DMX, Jadakiss, and particularly The Diplomats, Jim Jones--that's who I'm working with right now on an album, 'On My Way To Church'--there is explicit language.  And one of the things we say is that that's because they live in explicit situations, social conditions.  We wanna change the social conditions that these expletives describe, you know.  You cannot--young people are not gonna use Sunday school language if they don't live in Sunday school situations.  They live sometimes in very difficult circumstances.  Now, do we encourage positivity?  Absolutely.  But in order for the young people who put out the music or the producers to hear you, you have to spend time with them.  I go into the studio.  I go to the hip hop clubs, you know.  I was, recently I was in Jamaica.  Some of the elders in Jamaica have a problem with dance hall music, but they've never been to the dance hall.  So I've--you know, you can't be in judgment if you're not going to reach to those who you try to judge.  And I think that one of the things we found out in the Hip-Hop Summit Action Network, to the extent to which we provide an opportunity for rappers, for artists, for the girls who do the booty shaking in the videos, you know, I was recently, had to give a keynote speech at National Association of Black Social Workers [NABSW], and they had a whole conference about the negative impact of videos, particularly the booty shaking the girls dancing in very sexual, explicit ways.  And right before I was to speak, they had a sort of a Kwanzaa opening, and they had African dances.  And the African dancers came out and did their dance.  And it was--so I showed the video of the African dance with the video of the hip hop video, and it was very similar.  See, to me, part of music, part of dancing is a part of African culture.  But sometimes we put positive aspects on one type of the culture, and we put negative aspects on another, but it's really the same thing.  And I think that how we understand what is beautiful is also under an evolution, how we describe what is proper and what is not proper, what language is proper and what language is not proper, and how does our language reflect on how we live our life, all these issues that need to be discussed.  But I think one of the things that happened, there was a group led by my sister, C. Delores Tucker, and others who came down on hip hop, which only resulted in polarizing.  What we do, I find myself having not only to defend hip hop but to explain hip hop, 'cause the best defense is the best explanation.  And what our young people need today is to be embraced, need to be nurtured, need to be mentored.  The last thing this generation of young people need today is for people to judge them and then walk away after they're being judged.  No, we gotta reach for our young people.  You know, I don't care if somebody's in the gutter, I'm gonna reach for them.  I'm not gonna leave a brother or a sister in the gutter, gutter in the mind or gutter in physical life.  Everybody should be reached for.  Once again, what you do unto the least of these, you do also unto me.

Speaker 1: [HistoryMaker] Dr. [Benjamin F.] Chavis [Jr.], when you look back at your life, what stands out the most to you and why?
Speaker 2: Well, I'm thankful.  I'm grateful to the creator, I'm grateful to God, I'm grateful to Allah for life, and for the opportunity to live in a period of history that people are standing up more for freedom, justice, and equality.  It was a good feeling to be a part of the '60s [1960s].  You just have to understand, I remember when if you called somebody black, you, that was a bad thing.  You had a fight.  That was an ugly word.  I remember that when I was a kid, because that's how we were socialized.  In my first grade [at Angier B. Duke Elementary School, Oxford, North Carolina], we had books about Sambo.  And Sambo was this, portrayed as this ugly caricature, you know, stretched nose, big lips, who only ate pancakes.  And I've always wondered in first grade why, what--you know, there was nobody like that in my first grade.  But this was in the public school system.  They were teaching this in the public--so, they were not only discriminating against us, weren't giving us the right text, but the text they gave would, was so derogatory, you know, in terms of self-image.  That's why when I'm asked questions even about hip hop videos and stuff, today about image.  I, you know, I answered out of an understanding of how images and things are used.  In other words, there was a period of time where Negroes, then black people, then African Americans, even how we self-identify ourselves, we were taught to hate ourselves and not to love ourselves.  And one of the things I loved about the teachers of the Most Honorable Elijah Muhammad was about loving yourself, not by hating nobody, but you gotta love yourself.  If you don't love yourself, how can you love somebody else?  So, when I reflect back, to answer your question, I'm thankful to having an opportunity to make a contribution to the freedom struggle.  And I hope that the contributions that I have made and that I hopefully will continue to make are contributions that would not only push the doors further wider open for other people to have a better life, but I would like to believe that there will become a point in time when racism can be eliminated.  We're not there yet.  Have we made progress?  Absolutely, but we're not there yet.  I would like to believe there will be a point in time when black people will not be judged solely because of the color of their skin.  We're not there yet.  When [Reverend] Dr. [Martin Luther] King [Jr.] made his famous I Have a Dream speech, for many the dream became a nightmare, and many of us wake up in nightmare situations.  But that doesn't mean that the dream was not right, but we gotta work at it.  And if I've learned anything in my life, is that you get what you struggle for.  If you get something without struggling for it, you better question what it is and its value.  But you tend to value that what you get as a result of struggle and not what you get as an individual but what your people get.  And so I've seen situations in Africa--you know, I was in South Africa under apartheid, and you go back it's different.  But it still have problems, but they're making tremendous strides and progress, the same thing here in America.  I think we're making a lot of progress, but we still have a ways to go.  And I wanna be involved in my later--latter years and continue to make some contributions toward that struggle.

Speaker 1: What do you think was the biggest lesson you learned from prison?
Speaker 2: Not--the biggest lesson I learned from prison is not to allow anything or anyone to break your spirit.  They can take your clothes, they can take your food, but they can't take your spirit.
Speaker 1: Do you think it helped you relate to all kinds of people better?
Speaker 2: Well, no, I think that when I went to prison I had an attitude about the universality of humanity.  But it's interesting, I was asked by a reporter while I was in prison, what was my greatest learning in prison?  And I simply wrote this reporter from The Charlotte Observer back that my greatest learning was an affirmation of the oneness of God and the oneness of humanity.  And even though I was living in sort of an inhumane situation, it was interesting I came to that conclusion.
